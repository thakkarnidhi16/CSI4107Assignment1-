   In a move that reportedly shocked Attorney
General Edwin Meese III, the Justice Department's No. 2 official
and the head of the department's criminal division abruptly
resigned Tuesday as the nearly year-old criminal investigation of
Meese expanded into a new area of possible impropriety.
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns said in a letter to
President Reagan, ``Unfortunately, I have regretfully concluded
that I must return to private life at this time.'' He did not
elaborate.
   William Weld, who as an assistant attorney general oversees all
federal criminal investigations, resigned effective at the close of
the business day Tuesday, despite a personal plea from other
department officials that he remain on for several weeks.
   Two of Burns' aides and two of Weld's aides also quit
simultaneously.
   Meanwhile, independent counsel James McKay subpoenaed payroll
records and other documents of the Washington chapter of the
Multiple Sclerosis Society in connection with a job Meese's wife,
Ursula, got with the group.
   Washington attorney James Bierbower, legal counsel for the
society and a board member, said the records were delivered to
McKay on Monday.
   The independent counsel is trying to determine whether longtime
Meese friend E. Robert Wallach used his influence to help get Mrs.
Meese's $40,000-a-year job with the society in Washington, said
several sources familiar with the probe. Speaking on condition of
anonymity, they confirmed a report carried by CBS News.
   Wallach's lawyer, San Francisco attorney George Walker, was
quoted as saying in Wednesday editions of The Washington Post that
Wallach played a ``peripheral'' role in Meese's taking her position
at the society.
   However, Bierbower said the idea for hiring Mrs. Meese came from
the chapter's executive director, Jean Bradley.
   Bierbower said Mrs. Meese had done volunteer work for the group
since coming to Washington in 1981 and ``we were delighted'' to be
able to employ her to supervise a program that involves placing MS
victims in jobs.
   Bierbower said Mrs. Meese took the MS job instead of an offer to
conduct a public service job on a radio station owned by the Bender
family. The family operates a foundation which is contributing the
$40,000 a year for Mrs. Meese's salary, said Bierbower.
   Another top Justice Department official, Solicitor General
Charles Fried, said that the resignations were leading him to
reconsider his future at the Justice Department.
   ``The possibilities include my departure, or that this is just a
tempest in a teapot or many other things as well,'' Fried said.
   Fried, who represents the government in the Supreme Court, said
he learned about the resignations on Monday, the day before Meese
was told.
   Despite the departure of the top aides, Meese said Tuesday night
he has no plans to resign. ``No,'' he responded to reporters who
asked him whether he was about to step down.
   After receiving a standing ovation from his staff at a final
meeting Tuesday afternoon, Weld told his aides that the continuing
investigation involving the attorney general and ``Wallach'' was
casting a ``cloud'' that was having a negative impact on the
Justice Department, according to department sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Wallach is a San Francisco attorney who is at the center of the
criminal investigation with Meese. Weld also told his aides that he
was leaving at the end of the day because he didn't want to get
into ``50 fights'' and ``blood on the floor.''
   Weld, who publicly declined to discuss his reasons for
resigning, said he wasn't quitting because he might be upset over
possible new information uncovered by McKay, who has been
investigating Meese since last May 11.
   Another source familiar with events leading to the resignations
said the precipitating factor at this time was an internal fight
over the successor to Stephen Trott as associate attorney general,
the department's No. 3 post.
   Burns quickly denied that, however, telling reporters Tuesday
night at the Justice Department that it was ``very silly'' to
suggest such a scenario. Another department source who is close to
Meese said that the loss in the job fight was ``an irritant'' to
Burns and Weld, but certainly not the reason for their resignation.
   Burns unsuccessfully supported Weld for this post, according to
this source. Weld was willing to stay on if he got the job, but was
unwilling to do so when he lost it, in part because his two
predecessors as criminal division chiefs, Lowell Jensen and Trott,
both had won the same promotion.
   Asked whether his departure had anything to do with the
independent counsel probe, Weld said, ``I'm not going to go into
that.''
   Weld said he had informed White House chief of staff Howard
Baker at 7 a.m. Tuesday of the reasons for his resignation and
informed Meese an hour later. ``I prefer that those matters remain
confidential,'' he added.
   However, Meese's continuing legal problems have ``everything to
do with'' why the two men quit, said a department source familiar
with the reasons for the resignations who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The unexpected resignations were the result of the fact that
``major things aren't getting done at the Justice Department,
nothing's moving because Meese is under this cloud,'' said another
informed department source.
   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., demanded
that Meese explain why the officials quit.
   ``My thought is it's absolutely necessary that the American
people be told why these six (Burns, Weld and their aides) have
resigned,'' Specter said. ``It appears to be unprecedented in the
history of the Justice Department. The department isn't operating
when six resign together.''
   Specter, a member of the Judiciary Committee, said it may be
necessary to convene hearings if an explanation is not forthcoming.
   Meese first learned the two would step down when Burns and Weld
walked into the attorney general's office at 8 a.m. Tuesday and
informed him of the decision.
   Several department sources characterized Meese as ``absolutely
shocked'' by the decision.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Reagan
accepted the resignations ``with regret'' and thanked Burns and
Weld for serving ``with distinction.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan continues to have ``full confidence'' in
Meese and the Justice Department and that the resignations did not
cause any particular concern among the president and his advisers.
``We have people resigning all the time, especially late in the
administration,'' he said.
   Meese has been under investigation for nearly 11 months by
McKay, who last May 11 began looking into Meese's involvement with
the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. The investigation has expanded to
include his involvement in a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project.
   McKay's investigators are trying to determine whether Meese may
have been paid off by Wallach or others in exchange for Meese's
assistance to Wedtech or the pipeline.
   Meese has predicted repeatedly that he won't be indicted and has
said he won't resign.

   The school board voted Tuesday night to
withhold a salary increase in the 1988-89 school year for Joe
Clark, the tough-guy principal at inner-city Eastside High School.
   After meeting in executive session for an hour, the board voted
6-1 to deny Clark an increase on the grounds that he expelled
students from the high school without due process, was
insubordinate in refusing to readmit the students when directed to
do so and failed to maintain proper records and proper reporting
procedures.
   Board member Elease Evans said she voted against the resolution
because she thought the evidence was insufficent.
   Clark was not present, but his attorney, Vickie Donaldson, met
with the board for about 30 minutes and emerged, saying she had
``spoken her peace.'' She did not elaborate.
   Reached at home after the meeting, Clark said he would direct
his attorney to work to reverse the board's decision.
   But he also said the dispute ``was all worth it, because the
entire nation knows what buffoons exist on boards of education. If
it means that I lose an increment (raise) to make sure the nation
is aware of the deficiencies pertinent to ... education, then I
think it only fitting and proper that I accept that outlandish
punishment.''
   The board is still negotiating salary levels for next year so it
is not clear how much money Clark would stand to lose.
   Clark gained fame and plaudits from the Reagan administration
and most of his school's students and parents for his no-nonsense
approach, which included roaming the halls with a baseball bat and
a bullhorn.
   Earlier, the board had considered more severe action against
Clark, such as suspending him.

   A Japanese mathematician's widely publicized
attempt to solve one of the most famous problems in mathematics
appears to have failed, a prominent American mathematician says.
   ``I think it's wrong,'' said Gerd Faltings of Princeton
University, who has examined a 20-page manuscript prepared by
Yoichi Miyaoka.
   Faltings, who has won the discipline's prestigious Fields Medal
for work related to the problem, said Monday he thought the error
was fundamental enough that the proposed solution would have to be
abandoned.
   The problem is to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, named for the
French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who lived from 1601 to 1665.
   Fermat's theorum states that if X to the Nth power plus Y to the
Nth power equals Z to the Nth power, there is no solution for which
N is a whole number greater than two.
   ``Nth power'' means the accompanying number is multiplied by
itself N times. The theorem assumes that X, Y and Z are positive
whole numbers.
   Fermat wrote in the margin of a notebook that he had devised a
proof for his theorem, but it was never discovered. Coming up with
a proof has bedeviled mathematicians ever since.
   Miyaoka's proposed proof was widely reported earlier this month
after he presented it at West Germany's Max Planck Institute.
   ``It looked pretty good to start out with (but now) it looks
like the details are probably not going to go through,'' said Peter
Renz, associate director of the Mathematical Association of America.
   Still, ``it's a very good way to go at the problem'' and the
approach, based on geometric work by Soviet mathematician A.
Parshin, may still pay off, Renz said.
   Previous work has proven the theorum for cases in which N is
less than 150,000, he said. For higher values, no proof is yet
available.
   Faltings had expressed doubt about the new work in the March 30
issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education.

<HEAD>Firearm Company Founder's Son Keeps Browning Name Alive</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At 92, Val Browning piles his two
dogs into a car each day and drives 17 miles to keep alive the name
and reputation of the most prolific firearms inventor in history.
   Browning is the former president and now honorary chairman of
the board of the firearms company named for his father, John M.
Browning, who designed more than 80 military and sporting arms.
   A list of John Browning's inventions could serve as the
framework for any history of firearms over the last century. It
includes the Winchester Model 1886 lever-action repeating rifle,
America's first smokeless-powder sporting rifle, the automatic
shotgun, the Colt .45 automatic pistol and all the machine guns
used by U.S. troops on land, sea or air from World War I to the
Korean War.
   ``He was a most unpretentious man. You would never know he was a
man of any renown to meet. There was never any kind of show,'' says
Val Browning, whose description of his father could apply equally
to the son.
   Respected firearms inventor himself with 48 patents, generous
benefactor of colleges and hospitals, decorated by Belgian royalty,
Val Browning nevertheless has lived his life in the shadow of a
giant.
   ``He was such an extraordinary genius and accomplished so much
that there wasn't much left to do in firearms design except to take
advantage of modern materials and methods,'' Val Browning said of
his father during an interview at corporate headquarters.
   Indeed, Val Browning's two most satisfying inventions were
improvements to his father's designs _ a quick-loading feature for
the automatic shotgun and a single-trigger mechanism for the
over-under double-barrel shotgun.
   Val's son, John Val Browning, 62, was president of Browning for
14 years until just before it was acquired in 1977 by Fabrique
Nationale d'Armes de Guerre of Belgium. He speaks with insight
about the challenge his father faced as a son of the great inventor.
   ``It's a very difficult problem for him,'' the younger Browning
said. ``But I think that he always understood it. He was always
striving to do something on his own. He just didn't sit down and
live off the fame of his father. And what he could do, he did.''
   Two years ago, father and son returned to Belgium, where Val
Browning had charge of his father's firearms interests from 1920 to
1935, and to northern France, where as a young second lieutenant in
1918 he instructed American troops in the use of two John Browning
inventions _ the .30-caliber water-cooled machine gun and the
fabled Browning Automatic Rifle, or B.A.R.
   ``I was up at the front to keep track of them and to report on
their performance,'' Val Browning said.
   His father's .50-caliber machine gun was produced too late for
use in World War I, a conflict triggered in 1914 when a John
Browning-designed .32-caliber pistol was used to assassinate
Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie at Sarajevo.
   Eight years after the war, at the Fabrique Nationale plant at
Liege, John Browning, 72, suddenly took ill. Val Browning, who was
with him, recalls the moment:
   ``He said, `Son, I think I'm dying.' I said, `No, I don't think
so.' I was of course trying to encourage him. But he was, and he
did.''
   Returning to his native Ogden, Utah, in 1935, Val Browning
became president of the J.M. & M.S. Browning Co. and Browning Arms
Co., a post he held until 1962, when he was succeeded by his son,
John.
   But today, only Val Browning remains associated with the
sporting arms company formed the year after his father's death.
``That's one reason why I stayed on, so there would be somebody
with the name connected with it,'' he said.
   Like his father, Val Browning is a habitual walker and was,
before injuring his shoulder four years ago, an avid hunter of
duck, pigeons and small game.
   ``If I didn't eat what I shot I wouldn't shoot it,'' he said,
touching on reasons he believes the sporting arms business has a
rocky future.
   Population growth, dwindling wildlife habitat and ``the general
feeling against firearms in this country make it so that it's
rather an undesirable business to be in,'' he said.
   His son puts it another way: ``The idea of going out hunting is
considered somewhat reprehensible. The same sensitivity does not
seem to extend to fish.''
   Val Browning, father of four and a widower since 1975, embraces
life with an avidity and humor that belie his years. His dogs, Beau
and Jill, join him as he drives up Weber Canyon to company
headquarters at Mountain Green. He keeps busy there for three or
four hours a day, sometimes test-firing Browning's latest line.
   An early riser who walks two miles a day, he quit smoking 50
years ago when an errant cigarette ash ruined a good suit.
   Also, ``I used to like a cocktail very much indeed. And
sometimes three of them.'' But he's learned to ``sort of listen to
what my system was trying to tell me'' and a single cocktail every
couple of months, in social settings to ease a natural shyness, is
all he allows himself.
   ``He has the blood pressure of a 16-year-old,'' says his cook,
Nancy Clifford.
   More refined than his frontier father, he reads constantly, has
a substantial art collection and loves music.
   ``I'm trying to understand atonal music, but I think I'm a
little bit too old for that,'' he says in the deadpan that sets up
the punchline. ``In other words, I can't whistle it.''

   A rare first edition of Edgar Allan Poe's first
book, a collection of poetry written when he was 14, is to be
auctioned by Sotheby's, which calls it ``the most exciting book
discovery in many years.''
   In the 161 years since its publication, only 11 other copies of
``Tamerlane and Other Poems'' have been found. Published in 1827 by
an obscure Boston printer when the poet, short story writer and
critic was 18, it could bring as much as $300,000 at auction on
June 7.
   This 12th copy of the book was discovered in a bin of early
20th-century pamphlets on fertilizers and farming machines by a
Massachusetts book collector while he browsed at an antique barn in
New Hampshire. The price was $15.
   Recognizing the title from an article he had once read, the
collector contacted Sotheby's for an inspection and appraisal.
   ``It was quite a thrill,'' said Jay Dillon, an assistant vice
president in Sotheby's Rare Books Department. ``God, it was
thrilling. ... Here's a fabulous rarity, famous to anyone who's
ever taken more than two courses in American literature.''
   The Massachusetts man, who collects books on local history, said
he suspected it might be an original when he found it, though he
wasn't sure. He had the book only one night before turning it over
to Sotheby's.
   ``I knew I had found something great, a piece of Americana
...,'' said the man, who spoke in a telephone interview on
condition of anonymity. ``I knew it was valuable but never dreamed
that it would mean this much money.''
   ``Actually, I didn't handle it real carefully when I first got
it,'' he said. ``I thumbed through it. ... I never read anything by
Poe in my life. I really don't know too much about books.''
   Poe, who was born in Boston in 1809, orphaned when he was 11 and
raised in Richmond, Va., had the volume published during a short
visit to Boston.
   The literary importance of the 40-page book, which names the
author only as ``A Bostonian,'' is considered negligible; rather,
the work's value has to do with the fact that it's the first work
of one of America's greatest writers and a limited number of copies
were printed.
   How many were printed?
   ``One can guess, but they are all wild,'' Dillon said. ``I think
the range would be from 50 to 250. I would be amazed if more than
500 were printed.''
   The softbound book has its original, tea-colored paper wrappers
and is in unrestored condition. ``The wrappers are frayed, as one
would expect in a 161-year-old pamphlet,'' Dillon said. ``There's
also a light stain on the front cover running through first few
pages.
   ``But the condition of a book like this is not a matter of great
importance among connoisseurs. The question with this book is how
can you get one at all. I would prefer it to be in better
condition. ... I also would prefer to have Poe's signature on it.''
   Nine of the other copies are in public institutions, one is
owned privately and the other's whereabouts is unknown, Dillon said.
   The first copy didn't surface until 1859 when an antiquarian
bookseller in Boston sent it along with a consignment of books to
an agent in London who promptly snatched it up for the British
Museum. A second copy turned up 23 years later in a bookshop's
sidewalk box. It cost 15 cents and later sold at auction in 1892
for $1,850.
   Other copies have surfaced over the years through collections
and dealers. The 11th copy was discovered in 1954 and was auctioned
by Sotheby's in 1974 for $123,000.
   The poems included in the book are ``Tamerlane'' and a group Poe
called ``The Fugitive Pieces.'' They are: ``To ---,'' ``Dreams,''
``Visit of the Dead,'' ``Evening Star'' (never again printed),
``Imitation,'' ``Stanzas,'' ``Poem,'' ``A Wilder'd Being,'' ``The
Happiest Day'' and ``The Lake.''
   The adolescent collection was not exactly the literary hit of
the day. One critic noted: ``A book the critics read without
praising, and the ladies praised without reading.''
   However, the complex and tortured artist was vindicated in later
years through his sinister and compelling stories such as ``The Pit
and the Pendulum'' and ``The Masque of the Red Death,'' and his
musical and sensuous poems such as ``Annabel Lee'' and ``The
Raven.''
   He published two other volumes of poetry after ``Tamerlane,'' in
1829 and 1831. Poe died in 1849.

   On Feb. 15, 1986, the Amsterdam News printed a
front-page editorial calling upon Mayor Edward I. Koch to resign.
   Koch ignored it.
   He also ignored the next week's editorial, and the one after
that. He has now ignored 110 consecutive editorials on the front
page of New York's oldest black newspaper, each broadside demanding
that he leave office.
   The Amsterdam's weekly diatribe has become as much a part of New
York's clockwork as Billy Martin's hiring and firing as Yankee
manager, as the daily ebb and flow of commuters, as
alternate-side-of-the-street parking.
   ``Mr. Koch is incredible. Every week he gives me something new,
something outrageous, something wrong'' to write about, says
Wilbert A. Tatum, author of the editorials and editor-in-chief of
the 40,000-circulation weekly.
   While the Amsterdam News generally comes down on the left side
of the political spectrum, it is considered the establishment black
newspaper, less radical than some others published in the city.
   Tatum has written anti-Koch editorials while traveling in
Zimbabwe, Sweden, Britain, Ethiopia. He has focused on corruption,
racial tensions, homelessness _ all of them blamed on the ``weak
and fading'' Koch.
   Koch is ``mean-spirited and vindictive,'' Tatum wrote (March 8,
1986). He ``postures, preens and pontificates as he poses and
pretends to be mayor of all the people of New York City,'' Tatum
declared (Jan. 3, 1987).
   ``Certainly the business and social leadership in this town must
realize that this city is going to hell in a basket under the
leadership of Koch. How long will this outrage be allowed to
continue?'' he asked (Dec. 6, 1986).
   Koch plays it cool. ``The mayor's not commenting. He's just
going to let Tatum have his say,'' said a Koch spokesman, Larry
Simonberg.
   But in the course of a letter to the editor of the Amsterdam
News, written earlier this year, Koch mentioned the newspaper's
``incoherent diatribes against me each week `written' by a
non-journalist.''
   The first editorial was occasioned by the start of corruption
scandals just months after Koch's overwhelming re-election to a
third term.
   Tatum, along with much of the rest of the black community,
already had a difficult relationship with Koch. They had repeatedly
accused him of insensitivity to the poor and minorities; in 1984,
Tatum debated the mayor on the radio in a confrontation that
generated more heat than light.
   But Tatum said he was so shocked by the scandals that he was
forced to take a stand on the front page. When Koch was still mayor
a week later, he wrote another editorial, and resolved to keep
writing them until Koch left office. He said he did not think he
would still be doing it 109 issues later.
   ``I thought it would take three weeks for the Times, the News
and the Post to realize there was a real danger of what would
happen to this city due to the polarizing tactics of the present
mayor,'' Tatum said.
   Tatum is saddened by the failure of the city's major dailies to
join him; he speculates that the ``awesome power'' of the mayor has
something to do with it, alluding darkly to tax abatements, city
contracts and the like.
   Though the common wisdom is that Koch is safely ensconced in
City Hall, Tatum is convinced that he is making headway. He says
the citywide papers seem to be edging his way; he says he is often
accosted by people of all races who say, ``Keep it up.''
   He writes his editorials each Wednesday at 5 a.m., 2{ hours
before his deadline. ``I am not able to do other things like this.
... I type it myself and it's done in a matter of minutes. It's
that powerful.''
   He intends to keep at it. ``I can't allow any fool to destroy
what little relationships remain between the people of this city,''
he says.
   How long will he do it? ``For as long as it takes,'' he says.

   The imminent demolition of Hong Kong's
86-year-old synagogue to make way for high-rise apartments has
split the Jewish community and enraged preservationists.
   A group of local Jews has sought the help of rabbis in Israel
and Britain to save the synagogue and joined last-ditch efforts to
go to court to stop the wrecker's ball.
   ``I'm sorry that it has become such a controversial issue. I
never imagined that it would,'' said Robert Dorfman, chairman of
the committee that manages the day-to-day affairs of Ohel Leah
Synagogue's 230-family congregation, which includes 23 different
nationalities.
   Ohel Leah has been the center of Jewish life in this British
colony since 1902. It was built by Sir Jacob Sassoon, an Iraqi Jew
who came to Hong Kong from Shanghai.
   The stately white building, with two short towers and an arched
portico, is set in a serene garden on a hillside above Hong Kong's
central business district. Sassoon bequeathed the synagogue and
surrounding land to the Jewish community and set up a trusteeship
to manage the property.
   The plan to redevelop the site comes from the four Jewish
trustees who are led by Lord Kadoorie, an influential tycoon with
vast utility and hotel holdings. The proposal calls for replacing
the synagogue with a replica and putting up two apartment towers,
about 40-stories high, that will include a new Jewish club.
   Supporters of the redevelopment plan argue that the old
synagogue is unsafe and that bigger and better facilities are
needed for a growing Jewish community. They maintain that the vast
majority of the congregation supports the proposal.
   Opponents dispute the claims that the building is dangerous and
argue that alternative redevelopment plans are viable under which
the existing synagogue can remain.
   The Hong Kong government already has overturned a vote by its
Antiquities Advisory Board to declare the building a proposed
landmark and has approved a demolition permit for the developers.
   But a loosely knit group of dissident congregation members,
banded under the name ``Save Our Synagogue,'' hope Lord Immanuel
Jakobovits, the Chief Rabbi of England, will issue a ruling that
could halt the project.
   In a letter to the English-language South China Morning Post
newspaper, the synagogue's general committee promised that the
trustees ``intend to take his (Jakobovits') advice on religious
questions connected with the rebuilding of the synagogue.''
   Jakobovits has yet to respond.
   Three years ago, three rabbis from Israel signed an opinion that
quoted ancient commentaries and Maimonides, a 12th century Jewish
legal scholar, in concluding that the synagogue's ``destruction is
strictly forbidden.''
   The rabbis ruled the building is one of the world's city
synagogues, which Maimonides said cannot be destroyed because they
are for the use of all Jews and ``become the property of all Jews.''
   The synagogue's trustees contend, however, that opinion is based
on erroneous information.
   ``Save Our Synagogue'' members also are working with non-Jewish
preservationists in trying to save the building through
bureaucratic and legal channels.
   William Meachem, a member of the Antiquities Advisory Board,
said he is raising 100,000 Hong Kong dollars ($12,820) for legal
fees to for action to require the government to put a hold on the
project.
   He described Hong Kong's overall preservation record as
``atrocious, horrible, maybe one of the worst in the world.''
   Alan Goldstein, a member of the synagogue's congregation, has a
photograph made of Hong Kong in the 1920s showing the synagogue as
the only recognizable building still standing.
   Much of Hong Kong's architectural heritage has been replaced by
commercial skyscrapers and high-rise apartments that crowd around
the territory's famed harbor.
   ``Every civilized society in this world today ... recognizes the
importance of their cultural heritage and they have certain laws
and regulations to protect the best examples of their heritage,''
said David Russell, a senior lecturer of architecture at the
University of Hong Kong.
   ``Our only hope is to try to persuade the government of its
responsibility,'' said Russell, although he held out little hope of
success.
   But Dorfman insists the issue is for the Jews alone.
   ``Who are these people, who are they to get involved in this?''
he said. ``This is our synagogue, this is our community.''

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the decade-old Afghan
insurgency say they are forming a government and plan to rule the
nation from a mountain headquarters whatever the outcome of
negotiation in Geneva.
   They said their government will be ready to move into
Afghanistan within three months from Pakistan, where about 3.5
million Afghan refugees live.
   Indirect negotiations between Pakistan and the communist
government in Kabul entered their third week Monday in Geneva, with
U.N. mediator Diego Cordovez as go-between.
   Guerrilla leaders say they will not join any settlement of the
war without meeting directly with the Soviets, whom they describe
as the only other real party to the conflict.
   ``How can the outcome of these agreements be binding on us
(when) we have not participated as a real side?'' said Ahmad Shah,
a Moslem fundamentalist designated as president of the guerrilla
regime.
   Pakistan said the question of ``symmetry'' _ a simultaneous end
to Soviet military assistance to the government and U.S. aid to the
guerrillas _ was the last unresolved issue.
   Zain Noorani, acting foreign minister, said symmetry was a
``major concern'' for the United States and Pakistan although
outside the formal scope of the talks. The United States and Soviet
Union are the designated guarantors of the peace, but Washington
has said it will accept the role only if there is a ``balance of
obligations.''
   Guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978
and the Soviet Union sent military forces in December 1979. The
estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan would be withdrawn
under terms of a peace agreement.
   Shah did not give a location for the proposed government's
mountain headquarters. ``If the jets come we can go from place to
place _ no problem,'' he said at guerrilla headquarters in
Peshawar, Pakistan.
   He said the government would name a 14-member Cabinet within 90
days, consisting of two representatives from each of the seven
guerrilla factions.
   Shah and Zabiullah Mojaddedi, a moderate chosen as vice
president, are the designated administrators but real power would
rest with the seven party leaders in an executive council directing
the Cabinet.
   A third tier of government would be a council formed from a
cross-section of society, presumably including non-communist
members of the current Kabul government.
   According to Shah, the interim government would hold elections
six months after the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan.
   ``When we are convinced there is not a single Russian, man or
woman, civilian or military, then we can say they are gone,'' he
declared.
   None of the negotiating parties at Geneva has taken a stand on
the guerrilla vision of an Islamic republic but none appears likely
to embrace it.
   Pakistan speaks for the insurgents at the talks and has urged
them to form a broad-based government, possibly including
Communists, to prevent another civil war when the Soviets are gone.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, chairman of the guerrilla alliance, says
neither Washington nor Moscow wants an Islamic government in Kabul.
He claims the United States sold out the guerrillas by striking a
secret deal with the Kremlin on peace in Afghanistan.
   Shah said Islamic rule is misunderstood, largely because of
Iran's example.
   ``It is unfair for the world to judge that the real picture of
an Islamic government is (Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini,'' he said.
``An individual does not represent the real Islam.
   Other countries ``should not be afraid,'' Shah said. ``We will
be busy for 100 years to reconstruct our country. We will have no
time to bother people.''

   A U.S.-registered motorboat carrying 246 Haitians
was turned back by the U.S. Coast Guard about 450 miles southeast
of Miami, a little more than halfway to the United States, officers
said.
   ``This is the first time in a long time I can think of that
we've picked up a U.S. registered boat,'' Lt. Cmdr. Jim Simpson
said. Officials were still checking records late Monday to
determine ownership.
   A Coast Guard Falcon jet spotted the Miss Kay, a U.S. boat from
Houma, La., on Saturday morning, said Petty Officer Luis Diaz in
Miami.
   A cutter was dispatched to the boat and took the Haitians aboard
for interviews by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents who
were flown in Monday, Simpson said.
   Anyone with a legal claim to enter the United States will be
allowed to do so, but the Coast Guard generally turns back 98
percent of the passengers, he said.

   Mexican presidential candidate
Manuel Clouthier shifted his campaign schedule and attended the
funeral of a 15-year-old girl fatally injured by a stone thrown at
a Clouthier motorcade.
   About 500 people attended the funeral Mass for Maria Teresa
Ramirez Aguilar, who died Sunday of injuries suffered a week
earlier.
   At the funeral mass, Bishop Manuel Talamas Camandari called for
``civic activism that goes beyond vain ambition'' and ``a better
Mexico in which we all can contribute equally.'' Worshipers
applauded after Talamas' mass.
   Priests are forbidden under the Mexican constitution to espouse
their political views publicly. Clergymen have led several revolts
in Mexican history.
   About 300 people jammed the Sagrada Familia Catholic Church and
about 200 others stood outside, some straining to listen to the
Mass.
   Miss Ramirez, a student at Burges High School in El Paso, Texas,
was hit by a rock as she sat in the back of a pickup truck in a
motorcade trailing Clouthier, candidate for the opposition National
Action Party, from the airport to downtown Juarez.
   Chihuahua Judicial Police arrested five people and were looking
for others. Police alternately described the subjects of their
search as ``cholos,'' or young toughs, or as members of the
militant leftist Popular Defense Committee.
   Committee spokesman Juan Beltran Nunez said Sunday the party
shouldn't be blamed.
   The arrested suspects admitted throwing stones in the area, Jose
Garcia Gutierrez, an attorney with the public prosecutor's office,
told the El Paso Times. A judge will decide whether the suspects
will be tried in the girl's death, Garcia said.

<HEAD>Reports Say Renegade Contras Continue Attacks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Contra fighters oppose the
cease-fire accord signed by their leaders and the government, and
reports reaching the capital say renegade rebels are staging
attacks in violation of a fragile truce.
   The division between Contra leaders and the fighters was evident
Monday at talks to work out the mechanics of a formal 60-day
cease-fire to begin Friday.
   After Monday's session in Sapoa, Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, a
rebel military commander, told reporters:
   ``I want to tell the Nicaraguan people and the world that the
combatants are not going to put down their arms until Nicaragua is
a democracy.''
   Both the leftist Sandinistas and the rebels declared an informal
truce on March 21, the start of three days of talks that ended with
a document designed to end the more than six-year war. Monday's
meeting was to discuss the location of zones where the Contra
fighters will gather during the official cease-fire.
   The cease-fire agreement does not say whether the Contras must
lay down their weapons. That issue seemingly would be one of the
topics to be resolved during the technical meeting that was to end
today in Sapoa, the same southern border post 90 miles south of
Managua where last week's meeting was held.
   On Monday, a source who has been reliable in the past told The
Associated Press that an evangelical pastor, Enrique Morales, said
there was fighting Friday in the village of Juste in central
Chontales province when rebels engaged Sandinista troops. Two
soldiers reportedly were kidnapped.
   The same source said Radio 15 de Septiembre, the clandestine
rebel station broadcast from Honduras to Nicaragua, reported that
Contras knocked down electric posts Friday in southern Zelaya
province.
   The radio also said there was fighting Saturday in Paiwas, in
the easternmost part of the central province of Matagalpa.
   The Defense Ministry said it did not have any official reports
of combat. But an officer, who spoke on condition he not be further
identified, said: ``It's possible, we know there are some Contras
not in agreement.''
   Witness for Peace, the American-based organization that
documents Contra abuses, said on Monday night it had heard of no
truce violations.
   On Sunday, Interior Minister Tomas Borge said pressure from the
some sectors of the United States and dissident groups within the
Contra ranks were attempting to obstruct the cease-fire agreements.
   A violation of the truce during last week's cease-fire talks was
written off by both sides as a result of poor communications.
   In Sapoa, Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra, deputy defense minister and
army chief of staff, said on Monday there had been ``violations of
the truce of a minor character but we understand that they are due
to the communications problem.''
   A rebel commander attending the Sapoa talks, Walter Calderon,
said it was difficult for both sides to explain the cease-fire
agreement to their troops.
   The Contra fighters reportedly were caught off guard by the pact
signed by rebel leaders who live in Miami. Most of the combatants,
supplied with U.S. goods ranging from uniforms to weaponry, live
the rough life of guerrillas roaming in the northern mountains and
down through the central plains.
   During the past year they garnered some degree of public support
in the hinterlands, where peasants sold food to the rebels and
passed on Sandinista troop information. The war was described by
military experts as stalemated.
   The Contras' military ability grew enormously in 1987 with
air-dropped U.S. supplies that were part of the $100 million
package approved by the U.S. Congress in June 1986. The funding ran
out Feb. 29 and no agreement has been reached on additional aid.
   The loss of American support was said to be one of the main
reasons the rebels agreed to the cease-fire. The Contras agreed in
the pact to accept only non-lethal aid from a neutral organization,
such as the Red Cross. But the Contras also obtained promises from
the Sandinistas for democratic liberties.
   For the Sandinistas, the agreement offers a chance to rebuild a
shattered economy and calm widespread discontent over chronic
shortages and mandatory military conscription.
   The pact calls for the 10,000 or so Contras to move into special
zones during the first 15 days of April. The cease-fire is to last
until June 1. Conversations to work out final details were to be
held during that time, the first to be April 6 in Managua.
   The Sandinistas also agreed to gradually release 3,300 political
prisoners. The first 100 were freed Sunday.

<HEAD>Quick Trips Across Border Won't Bring Automatic Extension From IRS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quick trip across the border on April 15th
no longer will bring procrastinating taxpayers an automatic
two-month extension on their income taxes, the Internal Revenue
Services says.
   Traveling taxpayers now must leave the country for at least two
weeks, including April 15th, to qualify for the automatic extension
which previously was available to those who fled the country for
even a portion of Tax Day, the IRS said Monday.
   The IRS had been considering such a change for about a year, but
hastened its decision after seeing airline advertisements that
encouraged people to leave the country to delay their filing
deadline, said spokesman Jeff Krasney. He said the ads also
inaccurately suggested the IRS was endorsing such behavior.
   ``We didn't know if the ads would cause an abundance of
individuals to take this (extension),'' Krasney said. ``We felt
this would be one way to combat those ads.''
   The new ruling is effective for taxes due next month.
   Since the instructions already distributed to taxpayers say the
extension is available to travelers who are out of the country on
the 15th, the IRS will use some discretion in deciding who
qualifies this year, Krasney said.
   ``If people submit the proper documentation, such as a trip
notice, we will take a look at it and determine if in fact that
particular situation is legitimate,'' he said. ``The IRS will weigh
different types of factors to determine what is considered
extenuating.''
   But no more of those quickie trips across the border, he warned.
   ``Prior to this ruling, if you lived in El Paso, Texas, and
decided to travel to Juarez (Mexico) for lunch on April 15th ...
you would be given an automatic extension,'' he noted.
   Krasney said the crackdown wasn't being undertaken as a
``revenue-enhancing'' step, but rather to avoid ``possible abuse''
caused by the advertisements. He had no estimate on how many
taxpayers have taken advantage of the travelers' extension
provision in the past.
   Under the IRS rules on travel, some U.S. territories are
considered part of the country and others are not. Travel to Puerto
Rico, for example, will not qualify taxpayers for the extension.
But a two-week trip to Guam, American Samoa or the Virgin Islands
will net procrastinators two more months.

<HEAD>FDIC Could Lose Money Because Of Dallas Bank Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal fund that insures deposits in
commercial banks may lose money this year for the first time in its
history, but any shrinkage likely would be less than 5 percent, the
head of the fund says.
   Whether the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. loses money depends
on how much it costs the government to rescue First RepublicBank
Corp. of Dallas, FDIC chairman L. William Seidman told reporters
Monday.
   The deterioration of Texas banks, hard hit by losses on real
estate and energy loans, has raised concern about the health of the
fund, which backs deposits of up to $100,000 in 13,700 commercial
banks.
   Earlier this month, the FDIC pumped $1 billion into First
RepublicBank, the largest bank company in Texas, to stem a run on
deposits.
   Seidman said in a luncheon speech it is too soon to tell how
much more it will cost to fully restore the bank's health. But he
said published estimates of $5 billion to $6 billion are ``far
higher than anything likely to be required.''
   A better guide, he said, would be the $1.7 billion it cost the
government in 1984 to rescue Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co.,
which was about the same size as First RepublicBank.
   If the bailout is in that range and if banks, as expected, fail
at about the same rate as last year, then the FDIC's 1988 loss
would be ``something under 5 percent ... certainly under ... $1
billion,'' Seidman said.
   He said he did not see any prospect for what he termed a
substantial loss, one approaching 20 percent, or about $3.5 billion.
   Last year, the FDIC posted a slight increase even though a
post-Depression record of 184 banks failed. Forty-four banks have
failed so far this year and Seidman said he expected the 1988 total
to be roughly the same as 1987.
   As failures have increased, the steady growth of the FDIC fund _
from $4.6 billion in 1970, to $11.6 billion in 1980 and $17.9
billion in 1985 _ has slowed. The fund finished 1986 with $18.2
billion and 1987 with $18.3 billion.
   Seidman contrasted the relatively healthy condition of the FDIC
fund with that of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,
which insures deposits in 3,170 savings institutions.
   FSLIC was insolvent until last fall, when money began flowing
from congressionally authorized bond sales. It has had to keep
bankrupt S&Ls open because it lacked the money to pay off
depositors.

<HEAD>Lamb Production Expands For Second Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lamb production is at a seasonal peak because
of this year's earlier religious holidays and will ease down
somewhat in the next few months, says an Agriculture Department
report.
   With Easter and Passover coming up this weekend, lamb production
in the first quarter may reach about 80 million pounds and then
drop back to around 78 million pounds in the second quarter,
according to the department's Economic Research Service.
   ``Lambs on feed (for the slaughter market) were up 18 percent on
Jan. 1, 1988,'' the report said. ``These supplies should be
available during the first half of the year and could push
production up about 6 percent.''
   Lamb and mutton take a far-back seat with American consumers but
are still an important part of the U.S. food and agricultural
sector. This year, for example, per capita consumption may be about
1.4 pounds, compared with an average of around 83 pounds of
poultry, 72 pounds of beef, 63 pounds of pork and 1.5 pounds of
veal.
   The Jan. 1 inventory of all sheep and lambs in the United States
rose 4 percent from a year earlier to 10.8 million head, which
agency economists said represented ``the second year of expansion
following several years of profitability'' in the sheep business.
   ``The West showed the biggest increases in the ewe flock, about
6 percent above a year ago,'' they said in the April issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``In the Great Plains, sheep
inventories increased a little over 2 percent from a year ago. Most
of this expansion occurred outside of Texas, which has the largest
inventory of any state.''
   Analysts said they were surprised by a decline in the sheep and
lamb inventory east of the Rocky Mountains, including a 4 percent
drop in the North Central states. The Southeast was down 5 percent
on Jan. 1 after a 12 percent increase a year earlier.
   But the declines in the inventories were not sharp enough to
offset larger numbers elsewhere, which the West and the Great
Plains made up most of the breeding flock.
   Lamb prices averaged about $78 per 100 pounds, liveweight, last
year, up from around $69 in 1986. Market prices may decline
somewhat in 1988, however, according to USDA projections.
   Although lambs are a major part of the sheep business, so is
wool. And the rise in inventories boosted shorn wool production in
1987 to 85.8 million pounds, up 1 percent from 1986. That was the
first year-to-year increase since 1981, when shorn wool output rose
to 109.8 million pounds from 105.4 million in 1980.
   Wool output peaked at 388 million pounds in World War II before
beginning its decline, reflecting the long-term slide in U.S. sheep
production.

   Agriculture Department scientists are hopeful
that one of the costliest crop pests of farmers and home gardeners
may one day be curbed by a natural enemy, a microscopic killer worm
that searches the soil for the corn rootworm.
   The tiny worm, or nematode, is called Steinernema feltiae. After
infecting the rootworm, the nematode releases a bacterium that
kills the pest. Then, said USDA entomologist Jan J. Jackson, the
nematode uses the larva's body as a place to reproduce while it
feasts on bacteria and larva tissue.
   About 10 days later, hundreds of new nematodes emerge and start
searching for more rootworms.
   ``That gives you an advantage over chemical controls,'' he said
Monday in a report by the department's Agricultural Research
Service. ``A chemical just sits there and waits for the rootworm to
come to it. The nematode doesn't wait.''
   But Jackson found that the nematodes don't persist in the ground
long enough to eliminate a rootworm infestation. In one field trial
where he works at the department's Northern Grain Insects Reseach
Laboratory, Brookings, S.D., Jackson applied 100,000 nematodes to
the base of each of several corn plants, reducing rootworm damage
11 percent
   Jackson said that is not an acceptable level of control, but he
expects further research could lead to protection as good as from
chemical insecticides. A separate test with a chemical reduced root
damage 44 percent.
   Rootworm larvae destroy corn roots, and adults feed on the
leaves, tassels and ears. Jackson said U.S. corn producers spend
nearly $350 million a year to fight the rootworms. Nematodes
probably could be produced at about the same cost, without the risk
of chemical injury to farmers and the environment.

   A Kansas firm has been licensed by the
Agriculture Department to market a genetically engineered vaccine
to control pseudorabies in swine, a contagious disease that can be
deadly to newborn pigs.
   The vaccine will be marketed by SyntroVet Inc., Lenexa, Kan.,
said James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service. He said Monday the new vaccine is
the third live genetically engineered product licensed by the
department for pseudorabies vaccination.
   ``We have concluded the new vaccine is both safe and
effective,'' Glosser said. ``Our scientists have reviewed and
analyzed the procedures used to develop the vaccine, its biological
and safety characteristics, and the safety and effectiveness data
gathered during field trials in three states.''
   Further, he said, an environmental assessment concluded that use
of the vaccine would have ``no significant impact on the human
environment.''
   ``During field trials, the new vaccine was administered to more
than 400 swine, including baby pigs, weaned pigs and sows,''
Glosser said. ``No adverse reactions were noted.''
   Pseudorabies, also known as Aujesky's disease or mad itch, does
not affect humans. Although the disease caused an estimated $22
million in losses to the swine industry last year, it is not a
public health problem, he said.

   Elders of the Assemblies of God on
Monday began debating how long TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart should
be barred from preaching.
   The 232-member General Presbytery, meeting in a two-day,
closed-door session, will have the final say on punishment against
the fire-and-brimstone preacher accused of hiring a prostitute to
pose naked for him.
   ``This is not a meeting to determine the guilt or innocence of
Jimmy Swaggart; he has already confessed,'' said church spokeswoman
Juleen Turnage. ``They are here to make a decision on what will be
done with his credentials.''
   The presbyters met for about six hours Monday. The was no
immediate word on the progress of the deliberations.
   Swaggart, who did not attend Monday's meeting, tearfully stepped
down from his pulpit Feb. 21, admitting to unspecified sin.
Published reports have said he paid a prostitute to pose naked.
   The church's Louisiana District has proposed a three-month
suspension from the pulpit, despite a request by the church's
national leaders to reconsider.
   Church leaders noted that every other Assemblies minister who
has confessed to moral failure has been barred from the pulpit for
at least a year.
   The church's board of directors kept off Monday's agenda a
compromise proposal put forward by an Arkansas church member, said
Mrs. Turnage.
   The compromise reportedly would bar Swaggart from the pulpit for
a year but allow him to give personal testimony about what he has
learned from his sin. It would also cut the Assemblies of God out
of an estimated $12 million a year in Swaggart-raised funds.
   Mrs. Turnage said the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, general
superintendent of the Assemblies and chairman of the meeting, would
brief members on Swaggart's transgression and members would also be
given documentation.
   No witnesses will be called, and the case will be decided by
majority vote, she said.
   A New Orleans TV station reportedly had been asked to show
Assemblies officials a videotape of an interview with a prostitute
who claims to have posed naked for Swaggart.
   Mrs. Turnage said Carlson and others had seen a videotape
Monday. She would not comment on the nature of the tape and said it
would not be shown to the board.
   The Springfield News-Leader reported Monday that a Little Rock,
Ark., lawyer and Assemblies member had helped work out a plan that
would bar Swaggart from preaching for a year. Attorney Cliff
Jackson told the newspaper that the plan would allow Swaggart,
during that yearlong period, to give personal testimony.
   Under the plan, the Assemblies of God would no longer accept
funds from Swaggart's multimillion-dollar ministry to avoid the
appearance of conflict of interest.
   Swaggart contributes an estimated $12 million a year to the
Assemblies' foreign missions programs, which had a total budget of
about $142 million last year.
   Jackson, who met with Assemblies officials Sunday, said the
proposal had been endorsed by both Swaggart and Louisiana church
officials.
   Mrs. Turnage said the Executive Presbytery, the church's board
of directors, decided not to put Jackson's proposal on the General
Presbytery's agenda.
   She would not comment on what the board thought of the proposal,
saying only that procedures do not allow for outsiders to get items
put on the agenda for such meetings.
   However, she said, Jackson sent copies of the 10-page proposal
to every member of the General Presbytery, and any one of them
could bring the proposal up for a vote.

   ``It was now morning, and he was in the
bathroom shaving, shaving for the first time that day, but not the
last; no, never the last.''
   With those words, Gordon ``Satch'' Carlson, an English teacher
and newspaper columnist from Anchorage, Alaska, won the 11th
International Imitation Hemingway Competition on Monday at _ where
else? _ Harry's Bar & American Grill.
   ``The hairs kept coming,'' his entry continued, ``tiny hairs and
black and there was nothing for it, nothing for it at all but
shaving.''
   Carlson's winning parody of the late novelist Ernest Hemingway's
manly prose went on and on for 350 words, discussing the hirsute
portions of a man's body, then an estranged woman, then more
shaving, drinking wine, and then drinking more wine.
   The dozen judges, fortified with their own glasses of wine,
muttered things like ``Holy cow!'' as they pored over the entries,
then argued spiritedly and after some mysterious process decided
upon the winner among the 21 finalists.
   Author Barnaby Conrad, one of the judges, said Carlson's entry
contained qualities lacking in others, namely ``a beginning, middle
and an end, the Hemingway cliche, and the pun.''
   The punny last paragraph of Carlson's piece read as follows:
``She turned, lifting her thin American lip over those thin, white,
perfect, American teeth, and that thin American sneer. `It's only a
nick, Adams,' she said.''
   Nick Adams was a character in several Hemingway stories.
   Carlson gets a round trip for two to Italy, with dinners at
another Harry's Bar in Florence.
   In a brief biography provided to judges, Carlson claimed that he
was once thrown out of reading class and that he moved to Alaska
about 20 years for ``reasons that remain obscure'' to him. He gave
his profession as ``social gadfly.''
   Carlson, who was not present for the judging, did not
immediately return a telephone message Monday.
   At the Anchorage Daily News, where Carlson writes a weekly
column on state and local issues, City Editor Pat Doughterty said:
``He can be both very funny and quite acerbic and opinionated. He
basically is a humor columnist.''
   Carlson, who Doughterty guessed was 41, also writes a column for
the national magazine Auto Week and teaches English at Bartlett
High School in Anchorage.
   He and the other 20 finalists were among 2,432 entries from all
50 states and more than a dozen foreign countries. Despite the
author's globe-hopping exploits, none of the entries bore a foreign
postmark.
   The judges were to include Jack Hemingway, son of Ernest, but he
did not attend because of illness. Other judges were newspaper
columnist Herb Caen, authors Ray Bradbury and Cyra McFadden, and
poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti.
   The entries, went the rules of the contest, had to ``sound like
Hemingway. Read like Hemingway. They know that funny is good and
very funny is very good.''
   Entrant 66 wrote: ``There were many cows but no bulls. `I
respect this place,' Nick said. `It is an honest place ... this
could be the capital of the world.'''
   In entry 366, ``The president looked at the woman he called
Nancy ... other men also called her Nancy.''
   Sticking to the political season, finalist 287 told how in
spring, a fellow named Gary ``took the young woman to the Bahamas,
avoiding reporters and living on rum and sun and the catch of the
day ... he had not taken his wife.''
   Number 1,400 dealt with ``A Farewell To Arms, Legs, Feet and
Neck,'' while 923 sought glitter in ``A Farewell to Lunch.''
   In another Nick adventure, entrant No. 1,507 portrayed the hero
gazing into ``a plate of trout amandine ... his eye lingered over a
big, two-breasted capon, all the while leaning on a wall of pasta.
Above all, thought Nick, it was `a farewell to qualms.'''

<HEAD>Task Force Says $3 Billion In Seed Money Needed For Housing</HEAD>

   A private task force is recommending a series
of actions to provide ``fit, livable and affordable housing for all
Americans'' by the year 2000, starting with a first-year
appropriation of $3 billion.
   The report of the National Housing Task Force issued Monday
urges that half the money go to the states as matching funds, and
the remaining $1.5 million go to cities with no matching
requirement and few bureaucratic rules on how it is to be spent.
   The task force said housing for most poor Americans is
``unavailable, unaffordable or unfit.'' It said the $3 billion seed
money should stimulate state and local efforts to develop, renovate
and conserve low-income housing and to produce 150,000 to 200,000
units.
   James W. Rouse, a nationally known developer and chairman of the
26-member task force, called attention to the growing percentages
of women and children among the homeless.
   ``This isn't your typical hobo, this isn't a person who is a
drug addict, or alchoholic or lazy,'' Rouse told a news conference.
``These are people who want a place to live and in our country,
think of it, there's no place to live. I don't think this has ever
before happened in our country that people like this have nowhere
to live.''
   The report recommended that the government's rental assistance
program be increased by 200,000 units instead of the 100,000 in the
1989 federal budget. The added cost would be $380 million a year,
it said.
   Samuel R. Pierce, the secretary of Housing and Urban
Development, issued a statement saying that fresh ideas on low
income housing always were welcome. But the statement went on to
say that several of the recommendations call for significant
increases in federal spending and will require require difficult
budget decisions by the administration and Congress.
   The National Association of Realtors praised the report as ``a
step in the right direction.''
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee on
housing and urban affairs, said the report is ``of historic
importance'' and copies will be sent to all presidential candidates.
   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the subcommittee's ranking
Republican, said ``a decent place to live is no longer the problem
of the poor and homeless (but) the call comes from millions of
families, particularly young families.''
   The report said that from 1973 to 1983, 4.5 million units _ half
occupied by low-income households _ were lost to the rental market
either through demolition or structural conversion.
   ``Those who struggle with modest or minimal incomes represent a
cross section of America,'' said the report. ``They are young,
middle aged, elderly, disabled. They are single parents and intact
families. They are working.''
   The task force recommended that substantial new capital be
raised by establishing benevolent loan funds, accepting deposits at
low interest rates from ``socially motivated investors'' and
lending it at below-market rates to low-income housing developers
and home buyers.
   There must be greater emphasis on preserving and improving
existing low-income housing and renovation of thousands of units,
the report said, and it called for use of tax-exempt financing and
a commitment by the federal government to adequate rental
assistance. It also said the government should allow the Federal
Housing Administration to offer mortgages to more moderate income
people.
   While the report outlined a 12-year program, it said
homelessness is a problem that can't wait and recommended that
additional funds be made available in 1988 to states and
communities.

<HEAD>Speculation Builds Over Likely Nominee Bush's Choice Of Running
Mate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Vice President George Bush's grip on the
Republican presidential nomination tightens, more and more people
are asking the No. 2 question:
   Whom will he choose as his running mate?
   Bush says it's too early to think about it.
   Former President Richard Nixon suggests White House chief of
staff Howard H. Baker Jr. Baker says he doesn't expect to be asked
because he wouldn't bring the right strength to the ticket.
   Others propose California Gov. George Deukmejian. Deukmejian
says he couldn't accept because he would leave his state in the
hands of a Democratic lieutenant governor.
   Nixon, in a forthcoming London Sunday Times political column,
says the ideal formula is to pick your principal rival, as
President Reagan did with Bush. But, he suggests, maybe the
campaign between Bush and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole has been
too bitter for that.
   Some have another idea: not principal rival, but wife of
principal rival. How about Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth
Dole?
   And so it goes.
   Nixon argues that Baker, a Tennessean and former Senate
Republican leader, would be helpful in Southern states and in
dealing with Congress.
   In a recent television interview, Baker said, ``George Bush
needs to find someone who will bring strength to the ticket on a
regional and political basis, and I think that is not going to be
me.''
   He didn't say he would turn it down. ``If someone asked me to do
it,'' he said, ``I would have a very difficult time trying to
figure out what I was going to say.'' But, he added, ``I do not
wish that to happen.''
   Baker has mentioned former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
Deukmejian of California, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh as good choices for the vice
presidential slot.
   If Deukmejian left office in mid-term, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy,
a Democrat, would become governor of the nation's largest state. At
a news conference in Sacramento recently, the California governor
said, ``Even if they did ask me to accept the vice presidential
nomination, I wouldn't be able to take it.'' Later, he added,
``That doesn't mean I wouldn't like to be vice president.''
   Another possibility: Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who ran as a
conservative alternative to Bush for the presidential nomination
but fared poorly.
   Also mentioned is Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. She was on a
long list of potential Reagan running mates in 1980 but took
herself out of consideration because, as a freshman senator, she
said she didn't have enough experience. She has eight years more of
it now.
   If Bush should decide to choose a Midwesterner, to strengthen
the ticket in a region that could be crucial to Republican hopes,
another possibility would be Illinois Gov. James Thompson, who
endorsed the vice president and campaigned for him in the Illinois
presidential primary.
   Other names that have been mentioned include Sen. Alan Simpson
of Wyoming, Dole's deputy in the Senate leadership; Secretary of
Education William J. Bennett; Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, an
architect of the congressional deficit-reduction mechanism; and
Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser and one of
the top-ranking blacks in the Reagan administration.
   All of this, of course, assumes that the vice president wins the
nomination. He is way ahead, and Dole said last week, ``I think
it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the
Republican side.''
   Bush, asked whether he would consider Dole as a running mate,
said: ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any running
mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I
don't want to do.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fund raising for a proposed $4 million
memorial to black Revolutionary War patriots will begin soon since
President Reagan has approved placing the monument in the city's
main tourist district.
   Project coordinator Maurice A. Barboza said the memorial would
be the first prominently displayed monument in Washington dedicated
to blacks.
   Barboza said Monday that the president signed legislation Friday
permitting the proposed memorial to the 5,000 black veterans to be
placed in Area I, which includes the Mall stretching from the
Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial, the grassy Ellipse behind the
White House, Lafayette Park and West Potomac Park.
   The next step will be to study specific site plans being
developed by three architectural firms and submitting the best one
to the National Capital Memorial Commission, Barboza said.
   The commission and other agencies must recommend a site before
it goes to the Secretary of Interior for final approval.
   Barboza, a Virginia lawyer who has devoted himself full-time to
the memorial project, said he hoped to have the Interior Department
approval and start work on a design competition in six months.
   Construction of the memorial must begin by the end of 1991 under
an authorizing measure signed into law in late 1986. Barboza said
July 4, 1991, is the target date for construction to begin.
   Barboza predicted the memorial would cost about $4 million and
said he hoped to announce a major fund-raising effort within
several months.
   Barboza said he hopes to built the black patriots memorial on
the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument and
Constitution Gardens.
   Legislation allowing the construction of the memorial was
enacted in 1986, but another measure was needed to allow it to be
built in the city's monument-crowded Area I. That complex procedure
was established by officials who worried that the city's prime
tourist areas would become cluttered with memorials.
   The black patriots legislation was pushed through Congress by
Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., whom Barboza enlisted in his fight
several years ago. He is formerly of Plainville, Conn., in Mrs.
Johnson's district.

   Richard Gephardt did so poorly in Michigan's
caucuses that he knew his race was over. But he wasn't ready to
announce it yet, and one of those ugly scenes of modern politics
unfolded.
   In the death throes of his campaign, Gephardt attracted a large
press contingent. An aide to a rival muttered something about a
``death watch,'' and said to the reporters, ``Stay away from us for
a while.''
   Gephardt ended his speech and headed for a hotel room with his
wife, Jane. The crowd pursued, some walking backward in front of
him, television lights glaring, down a maze of corridors. Finally,
Gephardt reached the sanctuary of an elevator.
   One elderly man, caught up in the stampede, fell on his face
onto the concrete-hard floor. The crowd stepped around him.
   Reporters pressed Gephardt to say he would get out of the race.
   ``Did that do you a lot of good?'' senior aide Dick Moe snapped
bitterly at one reporter who has covered Gephardt throughout the
campaign.
   One television reporter, perhaps not realizing Gephardt was at
the end of his candidacy, persisted in asking the congressman how
he expected to do in Wisconsin's primary 10 days later.
   Gephardt press secretary Ali Webb was carrying a pair of red
boxing gloves, a gift from supporters presented two days earlier.
   ``Congressman, I have some boxing gloves here if you need
them,'' she said.
   ``I knew you brought those along for a reason,'' said Jane
Gephardt.

   On the eve of his victory in Michigan, Jesse Jackson spent one
of those campaign days a candidate hopes for _ the crowds were
overflowing and raw emotion was evident.
   Scores stayed outside the door at a church rally in Flint, even
after the fire marshal said the building was too full.
   Always appealing to the nation's downtrodden, Jackson even
campaigned among those who are arguably the most disaffected and
certainly his most captive audience: inmates at the Wayne County
Jail.
   Only those jailed on misdemeanors were allowed to meet him.
Since the inmates weren't felons, they could vote. And while his
real audience may have been the television cameras, Jackson
reminded the inmates they could cast absentee ballots.
   The next day in Milwaukee, Jackson appeared humbled by the
dimensions of his win. He spoke of ``a lot of poetry, a lot of
history.''
   What did he think, he was asked, of calls by party elders for
Democrats to nominate the candidate who leads in delegates ``at the
end.''
   Having just scrambled the Democratic race, probably assuring no
one will win a majority through the primary season, Jackson paused
and smiled.
   ``At the end,'' he said simply.

   At the Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church in Flint, Jackson
urged his mostly black audience to raise its expectations.
   ``Doors shut in your face _ I understand,'' he said. ``I was
born in the slum, but the slum wasn't born in me.''
   But before leaving, Jackson asked his supporters for a
contribution and referred to the expensive designer clothing some
wore.
   ``I want you to give tonight like you dress _ give Gucci-ly,''
Jackson said. ``Give like you live.''

   Gephardt aide Joe Trippi knew the results from Michigan weren't
going to be good Saturday afternoon. But his heart sank when he
heard some shouted news.
   ``Duke's ahead by 9,'' they said.
   Stunned, he interpreted the message to mean Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, often called ``The Duke,'' was winning big.
   It was only later that the real meaning was explained. Duke
University was beating Temple in the NCAA Eastern Regional
basketball game.
   His relief was short-lived. Gephardt lost by far more.

   Four of the Democrats met at an outdoor rally in Wausau, in
north central Wisconsin.
   Dukakis, Gephardt, Albert Gore Jr. and Paul Simon sat through
what must have seemed to them an interminable time on the stage,
listening to each other. They'd heard it all before, but seldom
under such conditions.
   The temperature was less than 20 degrees and a wind howled.
   Several reporters traveling with Gephardt found a respite,
however. They had arrived from the airport in a local supporter's
plushly appointed van, and the motorcade parked conveniently beside
the rally. From inside they could stay warm, hear the speeches _
and watch that Duke-Temple game on a color television.
   ``Wimps,'' Gephardt spokeswoman Webb said, pounding on the van's
windows from outside. They didn't budge.

<HEAD>Bush Picks Up Kemp Endorsement; Predicts Wisconsin Win</HEAD>

   Vice President George Bush, saying ``one of the
best things that happened to me was getting my brains kicked out in
Iowa,'' is moving to consolidate his mounting Republican support
while vowing to ``whip the Democrats.''
   With an unassailable lead for the GOP presidential nomination,
Bush on Monday picked up the endorsement of Rep. Jack Kemp. And
with the expected withdrawal of distant rival Sen. Bob Dole
looming, Bush talked of ``smooth sailing'' ahead for his campaign.
   Here for three days of campaigning in advance of the April 5
Wisconsin primary, Bush told an invitation-only rally in a high
school in nearby Cedarburg late Monday: ``I don't put too much
stock in the polls, but they do look good.''
   ``I will not project an arrogance, I will not project
overconfidence,'' he added.
   But Bush brimmed with optimism, saying Kemp's endorsement was
``good, because what we want to do is to have this party unified,
together, so we can whip the Democrats.''
   ``One of the best things that happened to me was getting my
brains kicked out in Iowa,'' Bush told his audience. ``Got beaten,
beaten fair and square and came in third.''
   ``Everybody had me dead and buried. (But) We were resurrected
right there in New Hampshire. So people say now things are going
pretty well for you, and they are.''
   Earlier Monday, Kemp joined Bush at a news conference in
Milwaukee to announce his support. ``George Bush is going to be the
nominee of the Republican party. He's earned it,'' Kemp said.
   The New York congressman dropped out of the race earlier in the
month, after poor showings in New Hampshire, South Carolina and in
Super Tuesday contests.
   Both Kemp and Bush said discussion of a possible vice
presidential bid did not come up.
   Kemp said ``my support is unequivocal'' for Bush even though he
had felt he himself was ``the best candidate for Republican
conservatives.''
   ``The voters believed otherwise,'' Kemp said.
   As to a Dole withdrawal, Bush said that was a decision for the
Senate minority leader to make on his own. ``I'm just going to keep
on campaigning,'' Bush said.
   Later, he told reporters, ``I'm not in a position to be telling
Dole what to do.''
   He said the general election contest ``will be close, it will be
tough ... I cannot act like I have this nomination in the bag.''
   However, Bush suggested a victory in Wisconsin would do just
that. And his sights were clearly set on the general election
contest beyond, repeatedly speaking of the importance of party
unity.
   Bush said he would take his case to the American people,
reflecting efforts to lay a groundwork for the general election
campaign.
   ``It's a national messsge,'' he told the rally in Cedarburg.
   ``This time, I'm going all the way to the White House,'' he
said, noting he had spoken at a campaign appearance in the town in
1980 in his then-unsuccessful presidential bid.
   As he has done before, Bush blamed Democrats in Congress for the
nation's $150 billion budget deficit, vowed to work to reduce the
tax on capital gains and echoed President Reagan's pledge to veto
all-encompassing stopgap spending legislation.
   And, also taking a cue from Reagan, Bush declared: ``I'm not
going to raise your taxes _ period.''

<HEAD>Contras, Sandinistas Discuss Location of Cease-Fire Zones</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As Sandinista government and rebel
negotiators met to work out details for a 60-day cease-fire, a
Contra commander vowed the rebels won't lay down their arms until
Nicaragua adopts democratic reforms.
   The negotiators, who met Monday, are considering the areas where
the rebels, known as Contras, will gather during the cease-fire,
which is to begin Friday under the peace accord signed last week in
Sapoa.
   After about two hours of discussions Monday, the talks were
recessed until today, and rebel leaders said there remained
obstacles.
   High-level talks aimed at reaching a more permanent truce are
scheduled for April 6 in Managua, the capital.
   The leader of the Sandinista delegation, Maj. Gen. Joaquin
Cuadra, deputy defense minister and army chief of staff, told
reporters on Monday: ``We come with the same spirit, will and
decision of the first meeting.''
   Leading the U.S.-backed Contras was Aristides Sanchez, a
director of the umbrella Nicaraguan Resistance alliance. He told
reporters the rebels presented their plan to the government.
   The rebel representatives included Walter Calderon, a former
national guardsman now known as Commander Tono; Luis Moreno Payan,
who uses the name Commander Mike Lima and is chief of Contra
military intelligence; Luis Fley, or Commander Johnson, chief of
rebel operations in northern Nicaragua, and Diogenes Hernandez, a
commander whose units operate in central Nicaragua.
   After Monday's meeting, Hernandez told a news conference, ``I
want to tell the Nicaraguan people and the world that the (rebel)
combatants are not going to put down their arms until Nicaragua is
a democracy.''
   He said Defense Minister Humberto Ortega proposed last week that
a Marxist democracy be established, but Hernandez said the Contras
want ``a real democracy like Costa Rica.''
   Cuadra declined to respond to Hernandez's remarks and said
Monday's talks dealt with the ``mechanics of the meeting.'' He said
the rebels made no proposals to define the zones where the Contras
would gather under a truce.
   ``We are hoping for an agreement before April 1,'' he added.
   A temporary cease-fire has been effect since March 21.
   Cuadra said there had been ``violations of the truce of a minor
character, but we understand that they are due to the
communications problem.''
   Sanchez said that in a few days the rebels will free the
Sandinistas they are holding captive. He did not give details.
   Others in the Sandinista delegation were Deputy Foreign Minister
Victor Hugo Tinoco and military intelligence chief Maj. Ricardo
Wheelock Roman.
   On Sunday, the leftist Sandinista government fulfilled the first
part of the cease-fire accord by freeing 100 political prisoners
under an amnesty program. Most of them were accused of activities
linked to the Contras.
   Under the Sapoa agreement, rebel forces are to gather without
interference from Sandinista forces in specified zones inside
Nicaragua during the first two weeks of April. Monday's talks
between special commissions of the two sides could be extended and
were to define ``the location, size and modus operandi'' of those
zones, according to the text of the Sapoa accord.
   Nothing is said in the Sapoa agreement about the Contras laying
down their arms. In past talks, the rebels insisted on keeping
their weapons until all provisions of an accord were carried out.
   Once rebel fighters have moved into the truce zones, the Contra
leadership can send up to eight delegates to participate in
national reconciliation talks on April 6.
   Last week's pact provides a gradual amnesty for Nicaragua's
3,300 political prisoners, guarantees freedom of expression, and
permits all exiles to return home and participate in the political
process.

<HEAD>Jackson Points To His Own Success As Message Of Hope</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Jackson is my third name; I'm adopted,'' the
candidate told the overflow church audience.
   ``Never slept in my father's house one night, never watched him
shave ... stayed with my grandmother till my mother got on her feet.
   ``I understand.
   ``Doors shut in your face _ I understand.
   ``Born in the slum _ I understand.''
   Then Jesse Jackson drove home the point with his own life as an
example of hope:
   ``I was born in the slum, but the slum wasn't born in me.''
   Jesse Jackson this time was speaking in Flint., Mich., where he
won a runaway victory in Saturday's primary election. But the
message is about the same everywhere he goes. He tells those
listening:
   ``Don't give up on yourself ... We the people can win!''
   That emotional message and Jackson's campaign theme of
``economic justice'' have served him well in his 1988 presidential
campaign, with a string of wins in eight states and several
second-place finishes making him the popular vote front-runner and
in a virtual tie with Michael Dukakis in the delegate count.
   As crowds flock to hear him around the country, it is apparent
that Jackson's compelling oratory and celebrity status generate
excitement not only among the downtrodden but also in affluent
communities like Georgetown, the nearly all-white domain of
Washington's well-to-do.
   On a recent visit, Jackson emerged from his limousine to find 50
squealing school children who grabbed for his hands and begged him
to visit their classrooms.
   After he led the captivated group in a chant of: ``I am
somebody. My mind is a pearl ... Down with dope, up with hope,'' an
eighth grader giggled that he had kissed her forehead.
   Her friend bubbled: ``It was great.''
   Students from nearby Georgetown University rushed out to their
porches to shake his hand. Jackson was the spontaneous toast of the
most elite neighborhood of the nation's capital, whose residents
have included presidents-to-be, diplomats and senators.
   It is a long way from the textile town of Greenville, S.C.,
where an illegitimate son was born to a teen-age girl and the
married man next door on Oct. 8, 1941.
   That child grew up to be a fiery civil rights leader, an
electrifying orator, a presidential candidate who says he knows
``the American people better than anybody running.''
   ``I know slave and slave master,'' he told an audience in his
hometown of Greenville.
   He recalls growing up in a segregated South where he had to ride
in the back of the bus and sell soft drinks in a whites-only
stadium.
   His mother, who married the man who adopted him and gave him the
name Jackson, worked as a maid for whites.
   But his background was not cause for despair, Jackson tells his
audiences.
   ``I was born in the underclass. I know how to get out because I
got out.''
   From Greenville, he went to University of Illinois on a sports
scholarship. After a year, he transferred to North Carolina A&T,
where he was the student body president, star quarterback and civil
rights leader.
   After graduating he entered the Chicago Theological School, but
dropped out to go south in the mid 1960s and join Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. in the struggle for civil rights.
   Jackson's actions in the aftermath of King's death have led to
speculation that he set himself up as King's heir apparent,
manipulating the spotlight to himself by showing up in Chicago in a
shirt he claimed was stained with King's blood.
   While he was present at the Memphis motel where King was felled
in 1968, others who were there have contradicted Jackson's claim
that he cradled the slain leader in his arms.
   Jackson has never held elective office, but his career since
then has kept him in the public eye almost continuously.
   He founded the Chicago-based Operation PUSH, which battled a
number of corporations over hiring practices and franchise
arrangements that Jackson said were racist.
   By 1984, Jackson was ready to run for president, spurred on by
the chants of black audiences across the country who urged him to
``Run, Jesse, Run.''
   His powerful eloquence fired up audience after audience as he
raced around the country and the world on a shoestring budget and a
chaotic campaign.
   He flew to Cuba to meet with Fidel Castro and Nicaragua to meet
President Daniel Ortega.
   He infuriated Jews by using the term Hymie and Hymietown, and by
associating with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who called
Judaism a ``gutter religion.''
   He took on the Democratic Party, attacking party rules as
exclusionary and unfair.
   Jackson emerged from the campaign with more 3 million votes,
then supported the Democratic ticket and went on to help register
large numbers of voters in the South.
   His approach in 1988 has been one of fence-mending and reaching
out to new constituencies. Aware that Democrats saw him as a
polarizing and divisive force in 1984, he has set himself up as a
peacemaker.
   He refrains from attacks on his opponents and encourages them to
focus on issues, not attacks.
   And Jackson urges Americans to look at his example to see what
is possible in life. He told a crowd of union workers in Detroit:
``Many of you are doing less than your best because your spirit is
broken.''
   ``You think I can't win because you think you can't win. I can
win and you can win. ... Expect your child ought to have a
first-class education. Expect you should live in a decent house.
You raise your expectations. ... Hold your head high. Know you're
somebody.''

   More than 700 members of the Army's 82nd
Airborne Division parachuted into their home base Monday in a
flamboyant end to 12 days of exercises in Honduras, where they were
sent in a show of U.S. might.
   As family members, commanders and a military band waited, seven
huge C-141 planes flew over at 5 p.m. Moments later, the first of
the paratroopers began their descent to the base's Sicily Drop
Zone, evoking a loud cheer.
   ``I am glad you are home, Baby,'' Delores Piper told her
husband, Staff Sgt. Charles Piper, as their two young daughters
clung to their father's legs.
   Later Monday night, about 100 soldiers from the 7th Infantry
Division Light returned to California, landing at Travis Air Force
Base to greetings from an Army honor guard and a band playing
``Stars And Stripes Forever.''
   Lt. Gen. John Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps at Fort
Bragg, welcomed the troops, who were dispatched to Honduras on
March 17 to counter a reported incursion of Nicaraguan forces into
that country. The 82nd is a division of the 18th Airborne Corps.
   ``Now, 12 days later, there are no Nicaraguan forces in that
country and a cease-fire exists,'' Foss said. ``We were watched by
everyone in the world, and everyone was impressed. I want you to
know I'm very proud of you.''
   Some 2,000 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne were deployed to
Honduras on March 17. There were part of a 3,200-troop force sent
by President Reagan. The rest of the American troops are expected
to return by Wednesday.
   ``The Nicaraguans ran back across the border as soon as we
came,'' Piper said. ``We did what we had to do.'' But he added it
was good to be home. ``Honduran ground is too hard to sleep on,''
he said.
   The mission ended just in time for 1st Lt. Steve Swimley, who
said he was becoming bored.
   ``We were doing the same stuff over and over,'' he said as he
hugged his wife, Mary. ``It was clear to me we'd be coming home
soon because we had accomplished our objective.''
   His buddy, 1st Lt. Jim Cooper, said he was looking forward ``to
taking a shower and drinking a few beers.''
   Earlier in the day, about 200 Hondurans demonstrated their
support for the Americans outside the Palmerola Air Base in
Honduras.
   They carried signs saying, ``Thanks for having helped us
maintain our liberty'' and ``Unity makes for democracy, thanks for
being here.''
   Nicaragua denied the reported incursion and claimed the United
States was preparing to invade or was using the deployment as a
cover for providing equipment to the Contras. U.S. officials have
said the troops are taking back all the equipment they brought with
them, including tanks and aircraft.
   In addition to the 82nd Airborne, the reinforcements include
soldiers from the 7th Light Infantry in Fort Ord, Calif.
   The U.S. troops never saw action, but Honduran President Jose
Azcona Hoyo said all along he expected them to back him up if the
Sandinistas didn't withdraw.
   By late last week, Honduran officials said the Nicaraguan troops
were back on their own side of the border.

   NASA is taking a slow, cautious
approach in returning space shuttles to flight, but a leading
shuttle engineer says that doesn't mean anyone at the agency is
afraid to fly.
   ``I don't see anybody in the decision-making process who is
reticent about pressing on and let's get back in the air. ...
Personally, I have no hestitancy about returning to flight,'' John
Thomas said Monday.
   Thomas is manager of the team that has redesigned and is testing
the solid fuel booster rocket that caused the shuttle Challenger
explosion 26 months ago. The accident killed the seven crew
members, and the remainder of the fleet has been grounded while
NASA tests the redesigned booster joint.
   Workers here have begun assembling the first of the two booster
rockets intended to propel the shuttle Discovery into space when
flights resume. NASA has set a launch date of Aug. 4.
   ``We've been very careful with our design and test programs and
we've been very cautious in the assembly process,'' Thomas said at
a news conference at the Marshall Space Flight Center, in
Huntsville, Ala., which was monitored by reporters here.
   Thomas said the redesign test program has gone so well that the
stacking of the rocket segments could proceed with confidence even
though three critical test firings remain for the overhauled model
of the rocket.
   ``We're well on our way in the test program,'' he said.
``Everything is going well with the processing at the Kennedy Space
Center.''
   On May 1, the two boosters are to be mated with the huge
external fuel tank, and on May 14, Discovery will be attached to
the stack. Rollout to the launch pad is set for May 24, and a
20-second on-the-pad firing of the shuttle's three main engines is
scheduled for June 15, leading to the Aug. 4 launch with a crew of
five.
   Thomas said three more full-scale tests of the redesigned
booster must be accomplished successfully before Discovery can fly.
They are scheduled for April 20, June 3 and mid-July at the Brigham
City, Utah, facility of the manufacturer, Morton Thiokol.
   Asked if there was anything that could delay the August launch
date, Thomas said, ``We have a very ambitious processing flow down
at the Cape, and we could always stub our toe someplace along the
way ... or have something unusual turn up in the test program.
   ``But I don't see anything now that would prevent an August
launch.''

<HEAD>Brother Linked to Drug Trade, Attorney General Reportedly Resigns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney general of Colombia,
Alfredo Gutierrez Marquez, resigned after news media reported an
airstrip at his brother's ranch was used by drug runners, a source
at President Virgilio Barco's office said.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press late Monday that Barco accepted the resignation
earlier in the day. Neither the president's press office nor the
attorney general's office would comment.
   Radio stations RCN, Caracol and Todelar reported the resignation
Monday.
   An Intervision TV news program said on Sunday night that planes
used by drug smugglers operated off a 5,000-foot runway owned by
Libardo Gutierrez Marquez on a farm near Medellin, a city in
northwest Colombia where most of Colombia's reputed drug
traffickers live.
   The runway was next to property belonging to Pablo Escobar,
named in the United States as a top leader of the Medellin drug
cartel, and aircraft belonging to Escobar used it, Intervision said.
   The source said that Gutierrez acknowledged in resigning as
attorney general on Monday that his brother did own a farm as the
news reports said.
   Caracol had reported the attorney general resigned shortly after
a confiscated drug plane was stolen March 1 from a military air
base and landed at the runway, but the later radio reports said he
quit on Monday.
   Barco has declared war on the powerful drug traffickers, who
have killed a justice minister, an attorney general, judges, two
newspaper editors and scores of policemen and soldiers.
   The Medellin cartel smuggles most of the cocaine reaching the
United States, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says.
Escobar was among five men indicted on U.S. drug charges and named
as belonging to the cartel.
   The army said that when it raided a country estate owned by
Escobar last week, it found tape recordings linking drug dealers
with someone close to the attorney general's office. It did not
elaborate.
   Last year the army confiscated a twin-engine propeller aircraft,
an Aerocommander, that had been used for drug trafficking. On March
1, the plane was stolen from an air force base and landed at
Libardo Gutierrez's runway, Intervision said. It said air force
planes strafed the plane, other aircraft and hangars and that two
days later, army bulldozers destroyed the runway.
   The president says the government will not yield in the drug war.
   In the last two months, the army has attacked five homes of
suspected drug traffickers, including Escobar's home, and reported
finding arsenals of weapons and ammunition, stolen license plates
and army and police uniforms.

   The exit of Richard Gephardt from the race for
president gave President Reagan the opportunity to contend the
public has no appetite for protectionist legislation such as the
trade bill pending in Congress.
   ``I think the American people have decided that one Great
Depression is enough, and they aren't going to give the trade
demagogues a second chance,'' Reagan said Monday during a speech at
Reynolds Metals Co., in Richmond, Va.
   ``Protectionism isn't just bad economics _ it's bad politics,''
the president said.
   He pointed to the March 8 Super Tuesday presidential delegate
selection contests and said, ``Those who had predicted that
protectionism would be embraced in the South were proven wrong.''
   Gephardt, D-Mo., who had made the nation's trade woes an
important part of his campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination, announced Monday he was ending his bid. Gephardt had
done poorly in more than two-dozen states, including the southern
Super Tuesday states.
   Reagan long has advocated a policy of free trade and fair trade.
At the same time, he has resisted protectionist legislation, even
as the merchandise trade deficit climbed to a record $171.22
billion in 1987.
   Reagan derided an international trade bill that is under
consideration by a House-Senate conference committee and threatened
to veto it unless it is drastically changed. The panel is working
out compromises in the widely varying versions of the 1,000-page
measure.
   ``They've got a trade bill before Congress that could squelch
productivity, destroy American competitiveness and make all their
doomsday myths a reality,'' Reagan said.
   He accused his critics of ``predicting economic disaster,'' and
ignoring the fact that the economy is in the 64th month of recovery
from the recession of 1981-82.
   He said the bill's mandatory retaliation provisions could
``require me and future presidents to take actions that would be in
direct violation'' of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades
and ``seriously harm the national interest.''
   ``If enacted, they could weaken the international trading system
and could require the president to start trade wars,'' Reagan said.
   But Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
reacting to Reagan's remarks, told reporters, ``I don't think he
has really studied the bill and doesn't have a full knowledge.''
   Bentsen is vice chairman of the House-Senate conference
committee ironing out differences in the two versions of the trade
legislation.
   Bentsen said Reagan's remark that provisions of the bill could
lead to violations of international trade rules is ``just not
correct.''
   ``What the president is concerned about is that it makes him
accountable,'' Bentsen said. ``Most presidents don't like
accountability. This legislation requires him to do something. He
can't just do nothing.''
   Bentsen said the plant closing provisions would not cost
companies any money and merely reflect practices that most
corporations already are following. Those provisions would require
the firms to provide their employees with advance notice of
closings and large-scale layoffs.
   Reagan objects to many provisions in the trade bill, including
an amendment named for Gephardt that would require the president to
reduce ``excess and unwarranted'' surpluses run up by Japan and a
few other countries in trade with the United States. If
negotiations failed, the president would be required to use import
curbs to lower the surpluses at a 10 percent annual rate.
   The president could waive such action if he found it contrary to
the national economic interest or if the offending country were
wrestling with serious debt. But critics say the plan is a long
step toward protectionism and invites retaliation against U.S.
industries.
   ``You may have been reading lately that the trade bill is making
good progress _ that a lot of protectionist provisions have been
jettisoned,'' he said. ``And there is some truth to that. But
there's a long way to go before the legislation does more good than
harm to the U.S. economy.
   ``Only wholesale elimination of the objectionable provisions
will produce a bill I can sign.''

<HEAD>Reagans Sign Lease for LA Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and his wife will lease a
$2.5 million estate in the luxurious Bel Air district of Los
Angeles, the White House says.
   Elaine Crispen, press secretary to first lady Nancy Reagan, said
the Reagans signed a lease and mailed it within the last 10 days.
Mrs. Crispen said she did not know the amount of lease payments.
   The 1\-acre estate is owned by Wall Management Services, a group
of about 20 friends of the Reagans who bought it with them in mind.
   The three-year agreement gives the Reagans the option to renew
the lease or purchase the property, which includes a secluded house
with 6,500 feet of living space and a pool.
   Wall Management bought the estate on Aug. 21, 1986, from a
90-year-old woman who the investors said would lease it back from
them until the Reagans were ready for it. Mrs. Crispen said the
previous owner has since died.
   She said the lease agreement was worked out by the Reagans'
lawyers, the White House counsel's office and the Office of
Government Ethics.
   The Reagans lived in Pacific Palisades, in the western part of
Los Angeles, before his election as president. That house has since
been sold.
   They own a century-old, Spanish-style adobe house of five rooms
and 1,500 square feet at Rancho del Cielo, their ranch on a
2,250-foot-high mountaintop 30 miles northwest of Santa Barbara.

<HEAD>Gore Differs With Jackson on Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., saying his approach to
homelessness is ``more responsible'' than Jesse Jackson's, has
taken a rare if mild poke at Jackson in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   The point was one of the few areas of disagreement at a forum on
urban policy in the Bronx attended Monday night by Gore, Jackson
and Sen. Paul Simon. All three called for a broad spectrum of
improved social programs.
   Jackson urged ``emergency assistance for the homeless.'' But
Gore said: ``The cost of an emergency short-term response is often
far greater than the cost of a more responsible long-term effort to
respond to this problem.''
   Gore, of Tennessee, said his approach would include community
mental health care programs and permanent housing for the homeless.
   Simon said to the audience at Fordham University: ``I ask you
who is best prepared for the presidency.''
   The other Democratic leader, Gov. Michael Dukakis of
Massachusetts, did not appear at the forum. Aides said he had a
longstanding commitment to attend two fundraisers in Washington.
   ``If it had been possible to rearrange the schedule we would
have done so,'' Dukakis said earlier.
   Dukakis, Gore and Simon, of Illinois, made separate campaign
appearances Monday in New York City, an indication of the increased
importance of the state's April 19 primary, when the selection of
255 delegates is at stake.
   Polls have indicated a lead for Dukakis in the Connecticut
primary today, a dead heat between Dukakis and Jackson in the
Wisconsin primary April 5 and a lead for Dukakis in the New York
contest two weeks later.
   At the 1{-hour Bronx forum, Jackson, Gore and Simon agreed on a
need for more spending for education and housing, a greater effort
to combat AIDS and stronger measures to fight drugs.
   Gore urged ``an all-out war on drugs,'' noting that it is Vice
President George Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee,
who heads a federal anti-drug effort that Gore described as failed.
   Jackson criticized the administration's drug-fighting efforts
the most forcefully. He said: ``In Latin America, it's becoming
clear in this administration while the focus was on communism, it
was fascist drug lords that in fact were overthrowing governments
there and infiltrating our government and killing our people at
home.''
   He did not elaborate on the infiltration assertion.
   In a similar vein, Gore called CIA involvement with Panamanian
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ``a disgrace.'' Simon added:
``We talk about a war on drugs. It's been mostly public relations.
That's the grim reality.''
   On AIDS, the three criticized what they said was an
uncoordinated government response. But Gore lauded the efforts of
Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and said Koop should be considered
for renomination in a Democratic administration.

   About 70 homes were still evacuated early
today, more than 10 hours after a tanker truck overturned on
Interstate 95 near Washington and spilled a variety of chemicals,
authorities said.
   The accident, which occurred just before the afternoon rush hour
on Monday and caused at least 200 homes to be evacuated, also
forced Maryland authorities to close part of the highway. No
injuries were reported.
   Prince George's County Fire Department spokesman Tony Destefano
said crews were trying to separate the contents of the truck, which
must be done before the cleanup is completed and the stretch of
interstate can be opened.
   The accident occurred shortly after 2 p.m. on the southbound
lanes of the highway.
   ``We have five separate chemicals involved, both oxidizers and
peroxides, which can be explosive if they come in contact with each
other,'' Prince George's County Fire Lt. Col. Steve Edwards said
Monday. ``We're being very careful.''
   Edwards said the vapors emerging from the spill subsided quickly
and the chemicals did not present a health hazard.
   He said that although there was danger of the materials leaking
into a nearby stream, there was no immediate evidence of water
contamination.

   Investigators have taken two suspects into
custody in the shotgun slaying of an Indian activist who was
running for judge, the county sheriff said early Tuesday.
   `We do have a suspect, in fact, we have two suspects at this
time,'' Robeson County Sheriff Hubert Stone said shortly after 1
a.m.
   ``I can't tell you a whole lot more about it right now, because
you never know how these things will work out, but we feel pretty
good about it right now,'' Stone said, adding that no charges had
been filed yet.
   On Monday, commissioners in the racially troubled county called
for the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate the
slaying of 42-year-old Julian Pierce.
   Stone had said earlier that informants had provided
investigators with two or three names of possible suspects. He said
a hotline set up to receive tips on Pierce's death had received
more than 50 calls.
   ``We are checking with all of our informants that we have
working for us throughout the county ... the telephone's been busy.
We're getting a lot of tips from individuals throughout the
county,'' Stone said at a news conference.
   Meanwhile, Pierce's supporters said they would seek to change a
state law that would automatically make his opponent in the primary
the winner of the election.
   Pierce, a lawyer and Lumbee Indian, was slain at his rural home
over the weekend by three shotgun blasts in what Sheriff Hubert
Stone called an assassination.
   Commissioners adopted a resolution asking District Attorney Joe
Freeman Britt, Pierce's primary opponent, to ask the state attorney
general for a special prosecutor. The resolution is not binding,
said Commissioner Wayne Oxendine.
   Telephone calls to Britt's office Monday were not immediately
returned.
   Backers of Pierce also said they will seek a special legislative
session to allow a substitute candidate in the May 3 primary for
Superior Court judge.
   Harvey Godwin, Pierce's campaign manager, said the 25-member
Committee to Elect Julian Pierce decided Sunday night to ask Gov.
Jim Martin to call a special legislative session to change the law
to allow a substitute candidate in the May 3 primary for Superior
Court judge.
   State law says if a candidate dies 30 days or more after the
filing period closes in that election, the opposing candidate is
declared the winner.
   Under that provision, Britt, a white, would be declared the
Democratic primary winner. And since there is no Republican
candidate in the county, Britt would become judge automatically if
the law isn't changed or waived.
   ``This is a special case,'' said Godwin. ``This death does not
come under the law, which says death, but doesn't involve political
assassinations. This whole assassination was to get him as a person
and a candidate.''
   Jim Sughrue, a spokesman for the governor, said Martin would
meet Thursday with those requesting the special session.
   Meanwhile, Stone said a hotline set up to receive tips on Julian
Pierce's death had received more than 50 calls. Pierce was found
dead early Saturday.
   ``We are checking with all of our informants that we have
working for us throughout the county. ... The telephone's been
busy. We're getting a lot of tips from individuals throughout the
county,'' Stone said at a news conference.
   Britt, who had reported receiving threats after Pierce was
killed, and his family were in seclusion under police protection.
He issued a statement after the killing calling it ``sad and
tragic.''
   State Rep. Sidney Locks, a black minister, said he also
supported the call for a special session. He described the
situation in the county Monday as unsettled because of the slaying
but he doubted violence would occur.
   ``Things are very tense, but we hope cooler heads prevail,''
said Locks.
   Robeson County, which borders on South Carolina, is 37 percent
Indian, 37 percent white and 26 percent black. It is one of the
state's poorest counties, and has long been torn by racial
animosity.
   Anger at what the Indians call corrupt local government and
entrenched racism boiled over most recently Feb. 1, when two Lumbee
Indians took hostages at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton, the
county seat. Eddie Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs said they engineered
the siege in order to attract attention.
   James Davis, a member of a U.S. Justice Department team sent to
the county, said Monday that his team had met with residents and
will continue to meet with them.
   ``The tension in the community has caused the entire community
to express real concern,'' Davis said. ``We're here to try to evade
that tension and bring calm back to the community, to do whatever
we can to bring confidence back to law enforcement.
   ``I don't believe any of the minority groups are contemplating
violence. They are just grief-stricken.''
   Godwin said the committee will ask for special legislation to
``delay the primary for this office only, and set up a way for us
to find another candidate.''
   ``The reason why we chose to do this was because Julian as a
candidate and a person was not a quitter. He didn't belive in
giving up,'' Godwin said. ``I don't think Julian would've wanted
his death to go in vain.''
   Lonnie Revels, chairman of the state Commission of Indian
Affairs, said he is not sure if the Lgislature can legally change
the law retroactively. But he said he and legislators from the area
were looking into the possibility of a special session.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intervention by Japan's central bank helped the
dollar recover after opening lower against the yen in Tokyo
Tuesday, while stock prices rose substantially for the second
straight day.
   The dollar began trading at 123.88 yen, down 0.55 yen from
Monday's close of 124.43 yen, and then gained strength on the basis
of the Bank of Japan intervention and fiscal year-end buying by
companies, dealers said. The U.S. currency ended trading at 124.37
yen, down 0.06 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
gained 330.38 points, or 1.29 percent, finishing the day at
25,953.09.
   Traders said most stocks were managing to maintain their gains
from Monday, when the Nikkei index rose 301.99 points.
   The Bank of Japan began buying dollars shortly after the
beginning of trading on the foreign exchange market, dealers said.
They said the scale of the central bank's intervention was not
immediately clear.
   The bank, which does not comment officially on its market
activity, bought an estimated $300 million on Monday.
   The dollar's close on Monday capped a 2.72-yen fall over three
trading days.
   Traders said some market participants weren't convinced that
central banks in Japan and the United States were committed to
maintaining the dollar's past level. Recent intervention by the
banks appears to have been aimed at slowing the dollar's fall, not
at boosting its value, they said.
   Despite the dollar's rise from its opening level in Tuesday
trading, dealers said a yen-buying mood was likely to continue
after the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31.

   When Steve Meyer and Craig Peden found
a big, blue rock while gem hunting, Meyer thought it was probably
worth something _ but not enough to keep him from using it as a
paperweight on his desk.
   That was before last month, when a master gem cutter told them
the baseball-size stone they found in the Smoky Mountains of North
Carolina might be a star sapphire worth millions of dollars.
   Gem cutter John Robinson of Plano, Texas, said the sapphire
could surpass the 1,154-carat, $4 million Star of America sapphire
in both size and value.
   Robinson is cutting and polishing the crystal, trying to
determine if it will display a six-ray star when exposed to light.
   ``It has a good potential for starring,'' said Robinson, who
also cut the Star of America. ``If that happens, it will be an
important gem.''
   Peden said that even if the sapphire doesn't star, ``it's
probably worth a couple of hundred thousand dollars.''
   Meyer, a 32-year-old X-ray technician, said he and Peden found
the stone about 5 feet underground just before Christmas.
   ``We'd only been out about 10 times since the end of last
summer,'' he said Monday. ``And we got lucky.''
   Peden, who operates a dental ceramics business, said he hoped to
help his parents and establish a scholarship for Seventh-Day
Adventist students. Meyer said he would open his own X-ray
laboratory.
   Meyer, who spent much of Monday talking to reporters or doing
interviews for television, said the impact of his discovery was
just beginning to sink in.
   Has he heard from any long-lost relatives?
   ``No,'' he said. ``But I'm sure I will.''

   Olivia Walker has sewn so much glitter
and gleam onto the robes of professional wrestlers, she says she
has to wear sunglasses when she begins putting needle to fabric.
   She has assembled the silk and sequins which have flowed over
the shoulders of such wrestling stars as Dusty Rhodes, Lex Luger,
The Killer Bees and Ric Flair.
   Flair ``loves his robes, I'll tell ya,'' said Mrs. Walker, 44,
who has been making the gaudy creations for 20 years and lives in
this suburb south of Atlanta.
   How many has she made?
   ``It's either 972 or 792,'' she said recently. ``Let's say 972.
That sounds better.''
   Asked what makes a good wrestling robe, Mrs. Walker joked, ``The
money.'' Her creations cost up to $8,000.
   She said a robe's cost depends on the weight of its decorations.
One robe for Flair required 7,200 rhinestones, all applied by hand,
and weighed 45 pounds.

   With less than $2 million left before he
exceeds the federal campaign spending lid, Republican hopeful Pat
Robertson laid off his highest paid staffer and restructured the
rest of his national staff.
   Connie Snapp, the former media coordinator and one of the brains
behind the Robertson campaign, will be off the payroll as of April
1, Barbara Gattullo, Ms. Snapp's former assistant, said Monday.
   ``It's kind of the thing that happens when you reach the
spending limit,'' Ms. Gattullo said. ``There were no hard feelings,
I'm sure.''
   Ms. Snapp, a former vice president and marketing director for a
division of the New York-based advertising and public relations
agency Young and Rubicam, will continue with the campaign as a
consultant.
   R. Marc Nuttle, Robertson's former campaign manager, who along
with Ms. Snapp charted the early course of the campaign, also
becomes a consultant.
   The day-to-day management of the campaign will be done by Allan
Sutherlin who has 20 years experience in Republican politics and
has served as secretary and political director of the party in
Indiana.
   Ms. Gattullo, who will take over most of Ms. Snapp's duties,
said many of the changes were to streamline the campaign's focus
and finances. Robertson has between $1 million and $2 million
remaining before he exceeds the federal campaign spending cap for
primaries.

<HEAD>Residency Dispute Headed Toward Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys in the dispute over the residency
of secretary of state Evan Bayh predict the case could reach the
Indiana Supreme Court by the middle of April.
   The appeals process in residency dispute picked up speed Monday
when a Shelby County judge turned down a request to review his
ruling that Bayh does meet the five-year residency requirement to
be governor.
   Shelby Circuit Court Charles D. O'Connor overruled the State
Election Board's motion to correct errors in his March 14 ruling.
   Election board attorney Michael R. Franceschini said an appeal
will be prepared immediately along with a request that the Supreme
Court accept the case now rather than having it go first to the
Indiana Court of Appeals.
   The court action was precipitated by a request from Gov. Robert
D. Orr to have the election board rule on Bayh's residency. Orr
said he would not back down from seeking a high court ruling on the
matter despite urging from Lt. Gov John M. Mutz to drop it for
political reasons.
   ``The governor's position has not changed,'' said his
spokeswoman, Dollyne Pettingill. ``He is interested in a final
determination, one that cannot be challenged. And that must come
from the state's highest court.''
   Mutz is unopposed for the Republican nomination to succeed Orr,
who is barred from seeking a third straight term.

   Movie producers dueling for the rights to
the Jessica McClure rescue will pitch their proposals to a
committee charged with deciding who will tell the dramatic story.
   Mayor Carroll Thomas said Monday he will appoint a citizens'
committee to intervene in the squabble between two rescuers' groups
about which producer will film the story of the girl's rescue from
an abandoned well.
   The five-person committee will review all proposals from
producers who have submitted them, although only one deal has been
made so far.
   Thomas said the commitment that one rescuers' association has
with Los Angeles producer Larry Spivey, president of Highland
Communications Group Inc., will not mean that his proposal gets
preferential treatment from the committee.
   ``The only consideration is that Highland will be one of the
companies considered,'' the mayor said Monday.
   Those involved in the rescue have formed two associations, one
of mostly municipal workers and another of volunteers, each with
its own idea about who should film the story.
   ``The other two committees have indicated that they will yield
to (the citizens' committee's) decision,'' Thomas said. ``Both
groups have been saying they want what's best for the community.''
   The Jessica McClure Rescuer's Association, a group of more than
30 volunteers, committed to a contract with Spivey that includes an
initial payment of $200,000, plus future revenues to be divided
among members, said Kragg Robinson, the association's president.
   The other 11-member group, the McClure Rescue Association, has
not yet made a deal with a producer, but says it doesn't want to
work with Spivey.
   Jessica, who turned 2 years old this past Saturday, was pulled
from the well last October after being wedged inside it for 58
hours. The rescue was televised live nationwide.
   The McClures' attorney, Darrell Smith of Midland, again said the
family won't stand in the way of a movie.
   ``They also wouldn't insist on making one if it wasn't in the
best interests of the town,'' he said.

<HEAD>Number of Power Plant Accidents About Unchanged, Critics Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were about the same number of accidents
reported in the nation's commercial nuclear power plants in 1987 as
there had been for a slightly smaller number of plants the previous
year, according to a report by a group critical of the industry.
   The Critical Mass Energy Project of Public Citizen, a group
founded with the help of Ralph Nader, said in a report issued
Monday there were 2,810 accidents in commercial nuclear power
plants in 1987, as compared with 2,836 for 1986.
   At the end of last year, there were 105 nuclear plants in
commercial operation against 99 at the same point a year earlier.
   The project, which publishes a compilation of Nuclear Regulatory
Commission reports annually, noted this year as the ninth
anniversary of the accident at the Three Mile Island plant in
Pennsylvania.
   However, ``The findings of this study suggest that the lesson of
Three Mile Island has been forgotten by the nuclear industry and
its friendly watchdog,'' the NRC, said Kenneth Boley, one of the
authors of the report.
   The report said 1987 figures could rise slightly as additional
reports come in from the plants.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill Easing Return of Abducted Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has approved a bill that would make
it easier for a parent to recover a child who is abducted and taken
to a foreign country, even when taken by the other parent.
   The measure, passed by voice vote on Monday and sent to the
Senate, would enable the U.S. government to implement an
international treaty intended to overcome complex, time-consuming
legal issues blocking the prompt return of abducted children from a
foreign country.
   The United States signed the treaty in 1981. Although it was
approved by the Senate in October 1986, the United States has not
ratified the pact because the State Department said implementing
legislation was needed first.
   The treaty provides for the prompt return of children abducted
from their country or wrongfully kept in a foreign country, and
provides for visitation rights across international borders.
   The bill provides for accelerated procedures by the courts of
nine foreign countries that have ratified the treaty for returning
abducted children to their U.S. parents.
   The bill would direct state courts, when petitioned by foreign
parents, to order children returned to their habitual residence
abroad, even if there is no legal order establishing custody.

<HEAD>Equal Pay for Jobs of Comparable Worth Catching Hold, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local governments increasingly are
considering whether men and women should be paid the same for jobs
that are different but of similar value to an employer, according
to a private study.
   The survey, released Monday by the National Committee on Pay
Equity, said more than 1,500 local governments, school districts
and community colleges have taken steps to identify or eliminate
race or sex bias in the wages of civil service employees.
   Cities, counties and school districts in 24 states and the
District of Columbia have taken some action to address the issue of
pay equity, the report said.
   ``Americans are rejecting compensation systems that unfairly
penalize women and people of color,'' Eileen M. Stein, chairwoman
of the Washington-based coalition of women's, labor and civil
rights groups, said in a statement accompanying the report.
   ``It is indisputable that pay equity is taking hold at the local
and state levels,'' she said. ``Employer by employer, jurisdiction
by jurisdiction, race and sex discrimination will be removed as
wage determinants.''
   Pay equity, also known as comparable worth, is the concept of
paying men and women similar wages for different jobs judged to be
of equal value to an employer.

<HEAD>Dartmouth Faculty Backs President's Criticism of Conservative
Student Weekly</HEAD>

   About 200 Dartmouth College faculty members
endorsed a statement by the college president accusing a
conservative student newspaper of ``poisoning the intellectual
environment of our campus.''
   During a special faculty meeting Monday, Dartmouth President
James Freedman branded the staff of the off-campus weekly The
Dartmouth Review as ``ideological provocateurs posing as
journalists.''
   Chris Whitman, a junior who became the Review's editor on
Monday, called Freedman's criticisms unfair.
   The Review has been at the center of controversy since it was
founded in 1980. It has been attacked as anti-minority, anti-women
and anti-homosexual and has been championed by such conservatives
as William F. Buckley Jr. and former White House communications
chief Patrick Buchanan.
   Freedman's public criticism of the Review, the strongest to date
by any high Dartmouth official, came weeks after three Review
staffers were suspended and a fourth was put on probation for their
role in an angry confrontation with a black professor described by
the Review as incompetent.
   Freedman, who became Dartmouth's president eight months ago,
said he decided to speak out against the paper ``because I now see
that the Review is dangerously affecting _ in fact, poisoning _ the
intellectual environment of our campus.''
   The president said the college ``must not stand by silently when
a newspaper maliciously engages in bullying tactics that seem
virtually designed to have the effect of discouraging women and
members of minority groups from joining our faculty or enrolling as
students.
   ``What the Review has done on this campus has not been decent.
What it has done has been irresponsible, mean-spirited, cruel and
ugly,'' he said.
   About 200 teachers at the faculty meeting gave Freedman a
standing ovation and approved a resolution endorsing his remarks.
   Whitman said the Review is not ``anti-diversity.'' He said
students of many races and persuasions are or have been on the
staff.
   ``I think we're aggressive, we pursue investigative stories, but
I do not consider us ideological provocateurs or mean-spirited,''
Whitman said. ``I think we have an unquestioned right to evaluate
the faculty n a consumer-advocacy role.''
   As Freedman spoke, college spokesmen handed out a statement
saying that Dean Edward Shanahan had denied the four Review
staffers' requests for reconsideration of their disciplinary cases
stemming from the Feb. 25 confrontation with Professor William Cole.
   The students were charged with harassment, invasion of privacy
and disorderly conduct after they confronted Cole in his classroom
to offer him a chance to rebut an article that had harshly
criticized him.
   The college's statement also noted that Review staffers in 1986
were involved in a nighttime sledgehammer attack on symbolic
anti-apartheid shanties on the college green.

   For three hours Monday, I was
detained by soldiers who stormed the Marriott Hotel to arrest
opposition leaders and journalists. During that time, my notes were
seized and I was herded into a sports field with other reporters
for a lecture on Panama's crisis.
   I was arrested at the hotel after covering a protest march that
was broken up Monday by Panamanian Defense Forces troops shooting
shotguns and tear gas.
   After getting mildly tear gassed, I returned to the hotel and
heard soldiers had arrested opposition leader Carlos Ernesto de la
Lastra, whom I had interviewed during the march.
   I ran upstairs in the hotel to call the local Associated Press
office, but neither I nor the operator could get a line out.
   When I went downstairs, I found the lower two floors of the
hotel in chaos. Armed troops had occupied the ground floor and
civilian security agents were running around the second floor,
where the National Civic Crusade, a leading opposition coalition,
is headquartered.
   An agent spotted me, grabbed me by the back of my belt, and
marched me down the stairwell and out into a van. Eventually 10
people, some of them beaten on the back with chains, were crammed
into the small van.
   We were taken to the G-2 intelligence division next to the
headquarters of the Defense Forces, which is headed by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega. We were told to be quiet and stand with our arms
against the wall, which we did.
   We were searched, and the interrogators displayed great interest
in notes from the demonstration I had on sheets of paper still
stuffed in my shirt pocket, as well as my notebook. They took all
my notes and my passport and told me they were going to be
photocopied.
   The wall I was standing against was decorated by strident
pro-military local newspaper clippings that spoke about the
martyrdom of those who died in 1964 anti-American riots.
   An unidentified man who ran the offices asked me: ``Do you ever
write anything good, or just bad things?''
   Eventually my notes and passport were returned, just as a group
of several other journalists arrested in and around the hotel
arrived at G-2.
   Without being told anything, we were packed into another van and
taken to what turned out to be the military baseball field.
   That chilled me and Abidel Vivancos, a Mexican with ABC-TV. We
remembered that many of those who had disappeared in Chile after
the 1973 military coup were taken to the local soccer field
beforehand.
   ``The first thing I thought of was Chile,'' Vivancos said.
   At the field, about 40 detained people were being interviewed.
None of the top crusade leaders were there, but I later found out
many of them had been arrested as well. Two Panamanians were caked
in blood from apparent beatings.
   After half an hour standing in line, the military officials
separated the foreign journalists.
   Eight of us were put in a line together: Vivancos; Alfredo
Gudino, a Mexican with NBC-TV; Thomas Haley, a U.S. photographer
with the Sipa agency; J.B. Diedrich, a Miami-based photographer
with Contact photos; and Maria Cortina, a Mexican with Mexican and
Spanish radio; Jose Manuel Pintada and Eduardo Herrera, Mexicans
with Spanish television, and myself.
   Then, in a bizarre pseudo-news conference in Spanish, Maj.
Felipe Camargo complained to us about the ``disinformation'' of the
international press and how we were responsible for Panama's
disastrous situation.
   He told us to tell the world that it was only the upper class
protesting, not the common people, even though those of us who had
attended the protest march earlier had seen many working-class
people joining the ranks.
   ``Tell the truth,'' said Camargo. ``This is a class struggle.''
   He also told us strict instructions had been given not to arrest
journalists, but all of us told him we had identified ourselves and
been arrested anyway, which he shrugged off.
   Many of us then complained that if the Defense Forces did not
feel its side of the story was being told, its soldiers should not
harass the press and routinely refuse interviews.
   Officials in Noriega's regime have frequently accused the press
of misinforming and conspiring with the Reagan administration and
Panamanian opposition to bring Noriega down.
   Camargo agreed and said he would do something about it. He then
told us we were not under arrest and that we would not be expelled
from the country.
   He said he would read the newspapers to see if we told the truth
about the incident.
   Camargo then apologized for not having a taxi to take us back to
the hotel and asked if we would mind riding in a police van.
   We agreed quickly, and by 9 p.m., three hours after I was
arrested, the eight of us were dropped off in front of the hotel.

<TEXT>
   The president of a smoker's-rights group
says he is organizing a protest at key airports nationwide to
protest Northwest Airlines' plan to ban smoking on all flights over
North American soil.
   ``It's very important that Northwest recognize they are
displacing a significant portion of passengers,'' said Dave
Brenton, president of Smoker's Rights Alliance, who admits to
smoking about 1{ packs a day.
   Starting April 23, Northwest plans to ban smoking on all flights
within the 48 contiguous states and Alaska and flights serving
Mexico, Canada, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands.
   In announcing the ban last week, the airline said 80 percent of
its passengers were non-smokers and that even 30 percent of the
smokers had expressed a desire for smoke-free flights.
   But Brenton, a 34-year-old electronics consultant, claimed
Northwest overreacted to a minor issue and predicted that the
strategy would backfire, causing a loss of ridership.
   He said he hopes to turn out crowds of 200 to 300 next month at
Phoenix Sky Harbor International and a dozen other major airports.
   Northwest officials did not return telephone calls to the
company's headquarters in Eagan, Minn., for comment.

   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Soldiers fired birdshot and beat
protesters with rubber truncheons Monday to break up march by
10,000 people demanding the ouster of strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega. A general strike entered its second week. Also Monday,
police and troops swept into a hotel in the capital, arresting
opposition leaders and journalists.
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica _ Former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez planned a trip to Panama to ask its Roman Catholic
archbishop, Monsignor Marco Antonio McGrath, to mediate a peaceful
solution to Panama's crisis. Andres Perez spent two days meetings
with President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and Spanish Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez about Panama.

   SAPOA, Nicaragua _ Rebel and government negotiators began
hammering out the details of a 60-day cease-fire outlined in the
peace accord signed last week. They are to decide in what areas the
Contra rebels can gather during the truce. The talks, which began
Monday, were scheduled to resume today.
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ Reports reaching the capital say Contra
fighters opposed to the cease-fire accord are staging attacks.
Fighting was reported in southern Zelaya province and the central
provinces of Chontales and Matagalpa.
   WASHINGTON _ House leaders are trying to put together a package
of non-lethal aid for the Contras, who under the truce agreement
have promised not to accept any military aid. The closed-door
talks, which also involved Contra officials and the
secretary-general of the Organization of American States, broke up
Monday after five hours with Republicans and Democrats deadlocked
over the issue. More meetings were scheduled for today.
   FORT BRAGG, N.C. _ More than 700 U.S. paratroopers on Monday
parachuted into their home base 12 days after entering Honduras the
same way, where they were sent as a show of force against a
reported Nicaraguan incursion against the Contras. Altogether 2,000
soldiers from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division were deployed to
Honduras on March 17. There were part of a 3,200-troop force sent
by President Reagan and conducted exercises during their stay. The
rest of the American troops are expected to return by Wednesday.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Drug Dealer To Pay $2 Million in Restitution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge ordered a wealthy heroin dealer to pay
$2.2 million in restitution to the city's drug users, in what is
considered the first such use of a state law that allows crime
victims to be compensated.
   The money will be given to a drug rehabilitation agency chosen
by Mayor Edward I. Koch, said state Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Douglass.
   The judge said after the Monday court hearing in Brooklyn that
the $2.2 million figure was based on the cost of treating about 900
heroin addicts for one year.
   Douglass said it was the first time a section of the state penal
law that allows restitution to be paid to crime victims was used in
a drug case, although the practice occurs on the federal level.
   ``I hope this sets a precedent,'' he said.
   When the defendant, Agapito Lopez, was arrested in 1985, police
officers seized six ounces of heroin.
   According to the judge's calculations, if those six ounces had
made it to the street, the drugs would have been used by 898 heroin
addicts who would have bought 20 bags each of heroin.
   Douglass said he contacted numerous drug rehabilitation agencies
to find out what the least expensive cost per person was for
treatment. He was told it was $2,400 annually for out-patient care.
   The judge multiplied the cost by the number of drug users to get
the restitution figure.
   Defense attorney Frank Ortiz said in court he would appeal the
order. He argued that when the state Legislature approved the
restitution law, it only contemplated crimes where there was a
specific victim, like robbery or rape.
   He also argued that the law requires a hearing to be held for
any payment more than $10,000.
   Lopez, 44, was convicted March 5, 1987, of numerous counts of
drug sale and possession. According to Nancy Young, a spokeswoman
for Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman, Lopez sold 2,200
bags of heroin to an undercover officer for $26,000 between June
and August of 1985.
   Douglass sentenced Lopez in May 1987 to 25 years to life in
prison and fined him $52,000, twice the amount of the actual heroin
sale.
   Young said Lopez owned two houses in Brooklyn, at least one
house in Staten Island, a car dealership in Aguas Buena, Puerto
Rico, and other real estate in Puerto Rico. She said Lopez also had
in excess of $60,000 in bank accounts in the United States and
Puerto Rico.
   The district attorney's office would seize the assets needed to
meet the restitution, Young said.
   Holtzman said in a statement released by her office that she was
pleased with the judge's order because there is ``a desperate
need'' for drug treatment.

<HEAD>Most Taxpayers in Poll Say `Reform' Made System Worse, Not Better</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most American taxpayers say the
much-ballyhooed tax ``reform'' they are experiencing for the first
time has made the system worse, not better, according to a
nationwide poll published today.
   Fifty-five percent of those interviewed in the Washington
Post-ABC News poll expressed that opinion, compared to just 31
percent who said the new system is better.
   The poll also showed that about 3 out of 5 expect to pay more
this year than they did under the old system; 58 percent said they
believed their taxes are higher compared to just 22 percent who
said they will pay less. Twelve percent said they expect their
taxes to be about the same.
   When the tax changes were passed in 1986, members of both
political parties and President Reagan promised that the new law
would make the system fairer and simpler. But the poll showed that
most Americans wrestling with the tax changes in the first year
they have taken effect disagree.
   The poll was based on interviews with 910 people who said they
had filed or plan to file federal tax returns this year. Results
had a margin of error of 3 percentage points in either direction.
The Post did not give the dates the interviews were conducted, but
said just under half of those questioned had completed their tax
returns.
   Of those, 51 percent said their taxes are now higher as a result
of the changes.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., one of the chief supporters of the
tax changes said that many of the people complaining about the
system may not understand it. He told the Post that they may be
receiving smaller refunds this year but are paying less overall
without realizing it.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., who was one of the principal
architects of the tax changes maintains that the system is more
fair but has acknowledged that the final result did not
significantly simplify the tax system. Bradley blames this on
last-minute tinkering done with his proposal to eliminate the great
majortiy of deductions available to taxpayers.

<HEAD>Miami Herald Wins Three Awards, One For Hart-Rice Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Miami Herald won three distinguished-service
awards from the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta
Chi, including one for the newspaper's stories on Gary Hart's
association with Donna Rice.
   The Herald also won awards for foreign correspondence and news
photography.
   Veteran journalists from throughout the country judged the 1987
entries for the awards, presented annually since 1932 by the
journalism society.
   The Herald's Tom Fiedler, Jim McGee and James Savage won the
Washington correspondence award for their series on how Hart met in
a Washington, D.C., townhouse with Miss Rice after his repeated
proclamations of marital fidelitly.
   Publicity about the relationship last year led him to drop out
of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. He rejoined
the campaign briefly, then dropped out earlier this month after
faring poorly in several primaries.
   The Herald stories ``resulted in a major controversy in
political and journalistic circles after readers were apprised of
the differences between the public perception and the behavior of a
prominent, national political figure,'' the society said in
announcing the awards Monday.
   ``The accuracy of the Herald stories, while widely questioned at
the time of publication, has stood up under the thorough scrutiny
of critics. The stories were in the finest tradition of responsible
newspaper reporting and met the strictest standards of
journalism,'' the society said.
   The Herald's Guy Gugliotta, Jeff Leen and James Savage won the
foreign correspondence award for a series analyzing the Colombian
crime ring known as the Medellin Cartel, which allegedly controls
the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America to the United States.
   The newspaper also won the news photography award for Michel
duCille's series of black-and-white pictures showing how crack, a
form of cocaine, dominated the lives of impoverished people living
in a public housing project.
   The Dallas Times Herald won the society's public service award
for a newspaper with circulation over 100,000 for its series
explaining the effect of the government's immigration reform act.
   The Alabama Journal in Montgomery won the public service award
in the under-100,000 circulation category for its series on the
state's high infant mortality rate.
   The society will present its distinguished-service awards at a
banquet in Orlando, Fla., on May 7.
   Other awards announced Monday were:
   _Editorial cartooning, to Paul Conrad of the Los Angeles Times,
for cartoons on Lt. Col. Oliver North's testimony before Congress
on the Iran-Contra affair. Conrad, the recipient of six
distinguished-service awards, has been honored by the society more
than any other journalist.
   _TV spot news reporting, to Allen Pizzey, Paul Vittoroulis and
Georges Ioannides of CBS for a report on efforts to rescue crewmen
from a burning Cypriot tanker in the Persian Gulf.
   _Public service by a TV station in the top 50 markets, to KING
in Seattle, for a documentary exploring the impact of sex education
on teen-agers.
   _Public service by a smaller-market TV station, to WBRZ in Baton
Rouge, La., for a documentary examining how state and city
officials failed to appeal costly court judgments.
   _Television editorials, to Phil Johnson of WWL in New Orleans,
for a series lambasting the administration of a prison for young,
first-time offenders.
   _General reporting by a newspaper with circulation over 100,000,
to Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press for a
three-part series on a political activist with AIDS.
   _General reporting by a newspaper with circulation under
100,000, to Paul Nyden of The Charleston (West Va.) Gazette for a
series examining malpractice claims and insurance settlements in
the state.
   _Editorial writing, to Jane Healy of The Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel
for a series on how Orange County commissioners mismanged plans for
urban development.
   _Magazine public service, to The Washington Post Magazine for a
story by Walt Harrington focusing on a father's struggle to cope
with the kidnapping of his three-week-old son.
   _Magazine reporting, to Stephen Fried, senior editor of
Philadelphia magazine, for a story on how a suburban police officer
sexually molested boys over the past 25 years.
   _Radio public service, to MonitoRadio, a Christian Science
Monitor news program, for a series on the plight of children in
developing nations.
   _Radio spot news reporting, to the news staff of KNX-AM in Los
Angeles, for coverage of an earthquake and aftershocks that rocked
Southern California in October.
   _Editorials on radio, to Catharine Cahan of Chicago's WBBM-AM,
for a series calling for flexible hours in city health clinics,
based on the needs of the community.
   _Journalism research, to Randall P. Bezanson, Gilbert Cranberg
and John Soloski, for their book ``Libel Law and the Press.''
   _Print bicentennial, to John Lofton, retired editorial writer
for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch for a series examining how
provisions of the U.S. Constitution came to be.
   _Broadcast bicentennial, to Beatrice Black of WHYY-FM in
Philadelphia, for a story on First Amendment rights of individuals
protesting abortion.

   The Nevado del Ruiz volcano grew calmer,
but the government insisted that people continue evacuating areas
close to the crater.
   The volcano was spouting steam on Monday, but no ash was falling
in areas around the volcano, the government's National Emergency
Committee said. Also, no tremors were being recorded.
   The volcano started spewing steam and ash on Friday, becoming
the most active since it erupted Nov. 13, 1985, when 23,000 persons
were killed.
   People within a six-mile radius of the volcano were ordered to
evacuate.
   The Bogota newspapers El Tiempo and El Espectador reported
Monday that many people in small villages were refusing to leave.
In Murillo, the largest village close to the volcano, Mayor Jesus
Maria Romero Aranzazu said only eight of the 600 residents there
had left, El Espectador reported.
   Murillo, undamaged by the 1985 eruption, is five miles from the
volcano.

   A DC9 jetliner and a two-seat training plane flew
within 700 feet of each other over England, the Civil Aviation
Authority said.
   The incident occurred Sunday two miles south of Cambridge
Airport, the authority said Monday.
   It involved a Paramount Airways DC9, which was carrying no
passengers, and a Piper PA38 Tomahawk. The two planes were flying
at an altitude of 2,000 feet.
   The Civil Aviation Authority did not say what caused the planes
to fly so close to each other, but said the incident would be
investigated by the independent Joint Air Miss Working Group.
   The standard safe distance between two planes is 1,000 feet.
   Paramount Airways is a new regional airline based in Bristol,
England.
   The Civil Aviation Authority recently adopted a policy of
reporting all near-collisions over British air space.

   The South African army's display
of Nazi flags at a military pageant has drawn criticism, a military
spokeswoman said.
   The military displayed the Nazi flags last week at The Castle, a
historic military building in Cape Town.
   A Jewish visitor complained when he saw the flags, which contain
a swastika, the military spokeswoman, Lt. Ina Fourie, said on
Monday. A number of telephone callers also objected to the display,
Ms. Fourie added.
   She said the use of the flags was ``merely symbolic in depicting
World War II. We are very sorry if we have offended or hurt
anyone.''
   She said the flags would no longer be displayed.
   South Africa supported the Allied side in World War II, but a
large segment of the white population was sympathetic to Germany.

<HEAD>Teachers' Strike Enters Third Week</HEAD>

   A nationwide teachers' strike
that has prevented 7.2 million children aged 3 to 18 from starting
public school this year has entered its third week with no end in
sight, officials said.
   The walkout by 505,000 primary and secondary school teachers
belonging to CTERA, the Confederation of Educational Workers of the
Argentine Republic union, began March 14 over demands to be paid a
minimum of $115 a month.
   The government under Education Minister Jorge Sabato, while
admitting teachers' salaries are low, has offered $85, saying it
cannot pay more because of the economic crisis. Some teachers
receive only $55 a month.
   Inflation in Argentina, the developing world's third-most
indebted nation, was 189 percent in 1987 and 10.4 percent in
February.
   Private schools have been mostly untouched by the strike, which
entered its third week on Monday.

   Eighteen people were arrested in an
investigation into attempts by the Mafia to scare off competition
for construction contracts.
   The charges against the suspects, who were arrested Monday,
included criminal association, extortion and illegal use of
explosives.
   Police said the probe began six months ago after a series of
dynamite attacks on companies that won contracts to build part of
the Palermo-Messina highway and a new section of track for the rail
line linking the two cities.

   Searchers have found no evidence of a
fisherman who disappeared on the Sandy River last weekend after
tossing his life preserver to his son, sheriff's deputies said.
   George Earl Trenkle, 40, of Blackfoot, Idaho, was presumed
drowned after a Saturday boating accident in which he and two
others were thrown from their driftboat.
   His son, George Edward Trenkle, 18, said their driftboat hit a
log and capsized. The elder Trenkle gave up his life preserver to
save his son's life, then was carried by the current around a bend.
   The third man, Roland Parkhurst, 40, of Gresham, was wearing a
life jacket. He and the younger Trenkle were rescued by witnesses.
   A Multnomah County river patrol crew searched the bank and
surface for Trenkle's body Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Deputy Garr
Nielsen said nothing was found and that the search would continue.

<TEXT>
   Hail the size of golf balls pounded portions of Oklahoma early
today, where high winds and possibly tornadoes earlier inflicted
damage and killed a woman in her mobile home.
   Other storms were scattered along a cold front that extended
Monday night from the upper Great Lakes into the southern Plains.
   Thunderstorms produced hail 2} inches in diameter at Duncan,
Olka., Monday evening as well as near Comanche, Okla. Smaller hail
fell in other parts of the state, while the golf ball-sized hail
fell early today at Ada and near Tahlequah, in eastern Oklahoma.
   Meanwhile Monday night, thunderstorm winds near 60 mph were
clocked near Velma, Olka., and heavy rain drenched much of the
state. Oklahoma City received over 2} inches of rainfall over a
24-hour period.
   The high winds damaged a mobile home in Oklahoma City, killing a
woman inside and seriously injuring her husband. Elsewhere in the
city, about a half-dozen mobile homes where thrown onto their sides.
   In Mustang, Okla., police reported the roofs on City Hall and a
fast food restaurant were damaged by wind. The weather service said
a possible tornado was spotted near Mustang just before 5 p.m., and
other possible tornadoes in Oklahoma were reported at Harrah and
Midwest City.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered across Kansas and
Missouri and eastern Arkansas. A flash flood watch was issued for
tonight for southwest Missouri as the rains over Oklahoma move
northeast.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms extended into parts of Illinois
and eastern Wisconsin. Rain was reported across parts of lower
Michigan into western New York state.
   Freezing drizzle was reported in sections of Michigan's Upper
Peninsula early today, while rain was scattered across the Pacific
Northwest and snow was falling over parts of the southern Colorado
Rockies.
   Skies were mostly clear across much of the Southwest on Monday
evening, but high winds continued in sections. Carlsbad, N.M.,
clocked winds to 70 mph late Monday and Phoenix reported winds
gusting to around 40 mph at Deer Valley Airport.
   Some clouds moved into parts of the Southeast late Monday, while
dense fog formed along the Florida Panhandle coast.
   The forecast for today called for showers and thunderstorms from
southern and eastern Texas across the Mississippi and lower Ohio
valleys to the Great Lakes region; snowshowers in northern
Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin, and from northwest Montana to
eastern Washington; and rainshowers in the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs were expected in the 30s or 40s from upper Michigan across
the upper Mississippi Valley and the northern and central portions
of the Great Plains and Rockies to Idaho and eastern Washington;
the 70s or 80s from the southern Atlantic states and interior
portions of the mid-Atlantic states across the Ohio, Tennessee and
lower Mississippi Valleys to central and southern Texas; and the
70s and 80s from the desert Southwest to central and Southern
California. Elsewhere, highs will be in the 50s or 60s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from zero at
Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 75 at Kingsville, Texas, and Key West,
Fla.

   Spring thunderstorms spawned tornadoes and pounded Oklahoma with
hail and winds gusting to 75 mph that destroyed a mobile home,
killing a woman, while in Utah a snowstorm was blamed for a fatal
car-train collision.
   Frigid air followed the storm that hit Utah on Monday, and the
National Weather Service warned fruit farmers the low temperatures
could hurt crops today.
   Thunderstorms swept through central, eastern and southwestern
Oklahoma on Monday.
   A tornado touched down in southwest Oklahoma City, and
unconfirmed tornadoes were reported in nearby Mustang, Harrah and
Midwest City. Another touched down just northwest of Little Rock,
Ark.
   In Oklahoma City, high winds destroyed a mobile home in the
Sherwood Homes trailer park, said authorities, who could not
confirm reports of a tornado.
   Lillian Robinson, 69, was dead on arrival at Midwest City
Hospital, an unidentified spokesman said. Her husband, who was not
identified, was hospitalized in serious condition.
   The wind shoved some mobile homes off their foundations and
shook others, said trailer park resident Mike McFarland.
   ``It was a very loud noise,'' McFarland said.
   High winds also threw half a dozen trailers onto their sides at
a trailer company in Oklahoma City, and damaged roofs on city hall,
a fast food restaurant and a funeral home in Mustang, officials
said.
   Hail up to 4 inches in diameter was reported around the state,
the weather service said.
   To the north, thunderstorms dropped golf ball-size hail just
west of Quincy, Ill., and marble-size hail at Leavenworth, Kan.
   The Utah snowstorm caused about 50 accidents, most of them
fender benders, the state Highway Patrol reported.
   At the height of the storm, a freight train collided with a car,
killing driver Villiami S. Pauni, 39, said Salt Lake County
Sheriff's Cpl. Ron Little. The train engineer sounded his horn and
the crossing signal was working, but the car apparently slid into
the train's path, Little said.
   A snowstorm in central Colorado also left roads icy, triggering
numerous accidents. In Montana, a snow storm left up to a foot of
snow.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin American nations met in
emergency session at Panama's request and were asked to denounce
foreign intervention in Panama and call on the United States to end
economic measures aimed at toppling Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   A formal regional position on the crisis in Panama is to be
drawn up later at the extraordinary meeting of the 26-member Latin
American Economic System.
   The organization, based in Caracas, was founded in 1976 as an
economic forum for Latin American countries.
   The organization is expected to reject any foreign intervention
in Panama, while urging that Panamanian military and civilian
leaders abide soon with the promise of free national elections,
delegates at the meeting Monday said.
   Individual nations, including Mexico and Venezuela, already
indicated their opposition to outside interference in Panama's
affairs, without specifically mentioning the United States by name.
   Noriega, who as military chief also is Panama's strongman, was
indicted on federal drug trafficking and money-laundering charges
in the United States, and President Reagan says Noriega must go.
Noriega denies the charges. The Reagan administration also has
frozen Panamanian government funds in U.S. banks, denying this
country a supply of dollars, the official Panamanian currency.
   In an hourlong speech Monday, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge
Abadia Arias asked the delegates for support against U.S.
``economic aggression'' which he claimed is meant to keep the
Panama Canal under U.S. control.
   ``Panama is suffering the most cruel economic strangulation seen
on our continent, within a strategy of domination with which the
U.S. hopes to replace the wars of annexation that the world thought
were long gone,'' Abadia said.
   Manuel Rodriguez Arriaga, Mexico's subsecretary of international
cooperation, rejected ``any act of foreign intervention to
influence the destiny of Panama.''
   ``We cannot permit that someone tells us from outside what is
good or bad. Today it is Panama, yesterday many others, and
tomorrow anybody,'' Rodriguez said. He called for U.S. economic
measures against Panama to cease.
   Venezuela's acting foreign minister, Horacio Arteaga, rejected
foreign intervention in Panama, but reiterated Venezuelan support
for ``revitalization of democracy in Panama.''
   ``We fervently hope that when Panama assumes full sovereignty
over the canal, its people will have consolidated their democratic
institutions,'' Arteaga said.
   He said Venezuela would like Panama's government to make good
very quickly its promise of free national elections.
   Delegates from other countries asked Panamana to call for free
elections this year rather than next, sources at the meeting said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   One delegate, also speaking on condition of not being
identified, said, ``Most Latin Americans would like Gen. Noriega to
leave, not to be toppled.'' In general, Latin American nations have
rejected the interference of the Panamanian military in the
civilian government and called their ambassadors home for
consultations. The meeting was expected to end today.

   More than 700 members of the Army's
famed 82nd Airborne Division staged a dramatic finale to their
mission in Honduras by parachuting into their home base as wives,
children and officers cheered.
   The paratroopers piled out of seven C-141 transport planes,
filling the sky with olive-drab parachutes Monday as family members
and officers applauded from grandstands.
   ``We went down there to do a job, and it turned out they really
didn't need us to do it,'' said Spec. 4 Randy Beebe, 24. ``When
they decided they didn't, it became business as usual, a training
exercise.''
   Meanwhile, about 160 members of the 7th Infantry Division,
dispatched to Honduras with the 82nd after Nicaraguan forces chased
Contra rebels into that country, returned to California as a band
welcomed them home with ``The Stars and Stripes Forever.''
   The soldiers, clad in full combat gear, marched out of three
planes at Travis Air Force Base before an honor guard dressed in
fatigues.
   The infantrymen came home today to their base at Fort Ord about
100 miles south of San Francisco, where loved ones welcomed them
with yellow ribbons and banners with messages like ``Good Job,
Guys'' and ``Welcome Home, We Missed You.''
   The 3,200 soldiers from both divisions had been sent to back up
the Honduran army on March 17, but never got close to the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border as they participated in training
exercises with Honduran soldiers.
   A 60-day cease-fire was signed last week between the Nicaraguan
government and the Contra rebels.
   ``We were watched by everyone in the world, and everyone was
impressed. I want you to know I'm very proud of you,'' Lt. Gen.
John Foss, commander of the 18th Airborne Corps, told paratroopers
lined up in formation after the drop.
   ``Twelve days ago, Nicaraguan forces had entered Honduras,''
Foss said. ``Now ... there are no Nicaraguan forces in that country
and a cease-fire exists.''
   Honduras, which requested the U.S. troops, had accused Nicaragua
of crossing its borders in pursuit of the Contras. Nicaragua denied
the charge.
   At Fort Bragg, soldiers celebrated their return in joyful
reunions with their families.
   ``It's great, it's great. Oh, God, it's great,'' Staff Sgt.
Raymond Gates, 29, said after hugging his wife, Sharon.
   His sons, Jarrod, 7, and Christopher, 2, leaped into his arms
while a friend held his rifle.
   Spec. 4 Beebe said he got a little nervous early in the stay,
``but this is what you're trained to do. We were ready to go.''
   He said the first thing he wanted to do was call his parents in
Missouri, and ``let them know I'm OK. My mom's the worrying type.''
   The paratroopers landed in the base's Sicily Drop Zone, a name
recalling the unit's glory days of World War II. The 82nd made its
first combat jump into Sicily, and later dropped into France with
the 101st Airborne Division in the Normandy invasion.
   Monday's jump ``was a good drop, a beautiful drop,'' said Capt.
Donald M. Sensing, a Fort Bragg spokesman. ``The first paratrooper
out was three seconds early, but we're not quibbling with that.''
   All 3,200 soldiers are expected to be back by Friday, Army
officials said.
   The mission ended just in time for 1st Lt. Steve Swimley, who
was getting bored.
   ``We were doing the same stuff over and over,'' Swimley said as
he hugged his wife, Mary. ``It was clear to me we'd be coming home
soon because we had accomplished our objective.''
   His buddy, 1st Lt. Jim Cooper, said he was looking forward ``to
taking a shower and drinking a few beers.''

   Six people apparently injured by mustard
gas allegedly used in Iraqi attacks on Kurdish villages arrived
here today for medical treatment. More than 30 others were to be
taken to other cities.
   Dr. Gerhard Freilinger, department head of Vienna's University
Clinic plastic surgery, said after talking with some of the
patients, their injuries appeared to be from mustard gas that may
have been mixed with a nerve gas.
   Freilinger, who since 1984 has treated about 30 victims of
alleged chemical weapons attacks in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf
war, said the effects on the lungs of the patients indicated they
suffered from the effects of mustard gas.
   Freilinger spoke to reporters at an airport where the injured
arrived aboard an Iran Airlines ambulance plane.
   It was possible the mustard gas was ``in combination with a
light nerve gas, because they all have bad headaches, are dizzy and
(some) may have been unconscious,'' he said.
   Mustard gas is heavier than air, which would explain how it
seeped into cellars where the patients said they had been hiding
during the March 16 and 17 attacks, Freilinger said.
   Iran has said the Iraq dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs on
three Kurdish towns in Iraq, killing 5,000 people and injuring
5,000. The attacks on the towns, which were captured in an Iranian
offensive, occurred March 16-17.
   Freilinger said two of the patients, a child and a severely
wounded Iranian soldier, were to be placed in the intensive care
unit at his university clinic. The four others _ three women and a
man _ were to be brought to private clinics in Vienna.
   The remaining Kurds on board the plane were to be carried on to
Geneva, Frankfurt, London and then New York.
   Freilinger said about 50 percent of about 30 patients he has
treated since 1984 survived, but added that patients only arrived
for treatment after 10 or 15 days, meaning that the damage done by
the gas could not be reversed.
   An Iranian soldier Freilinger had removed from the plane in
Vienna was originally to go on to New York. However, Freilinger
said the man's injuries were so severe, that he could not continue
the trip.
   Freilinger said poison gas penetrates everything including
clothes. ``They can't run away from it because if they do, they
breath it in even deeper,'' he said. He said mustard gas causes
changes in the lungs that can lead to suffocation. He said it could
also destroy the bone marrow and causes burns on the skin.
   Freilinger said in 1984 he had visited areas allegedly bombed
with chemical weapons and had taken a sample of the gas for
verification and testing.
   In the past Iran has sent soldiers allegedly poisoned by mustard
gas to Vienna and other European cities for treatment. In July,
Iranian civilians were brought for treatment for the first time.
   On board the plane, patients with burns on their hands, backs
and faces coughed violently or lay motionless on stretchers.
   One child of six who Iranian and Kurdish officials said had lost
her entire family in the attack, sobbed constantly and called for
her parents.
   Iran's Ambassador to Austria, Hossein Noghrehkar Shirazi was at
the airport when the plane arrived as were representatives of
several Kurdish groups.
   In downtown Vienna on Monday police arrested 60 people at a
Kurdish demonstration in front of the Iraqi Embassy against
chemical weapons attacks.

   Women, black and Hispanic police officers who
said the department discriminated in hiring and promotion practices
have been offered $9.2 million in back pay and an upgrade in
seniority, officials say.
   The consent decree signed by the city and the federal government
and announced Monday by the Justice Department must be formally
approved by U.S. District Judge Prentice Marshall.
   The settlement, which ended a 15-year legal battle, calls for
the city to give back pay to 729 women, blacks and Hispanics and to
adjust their seniority dates..
   Attorney Richard Gutman, who has represented two women in the
case since 1974, called the settlement ``recognition that people's
rights were violated. ... But even today, there are only 30 female
sergeants out of about 1,200 on the force.
   ``The current training class will yield only the first female
lieutenant in the history of the department,'' Gutman added. ``That
speaks for itself.''
   City Corporation Counsel Judson Miner said the settlement was
fair.
   ``There were many components to this case that had to be tried
over a period of years,'' he said. ``One of the priorities of this
office has been to resolve longstanding cases and still protect the
interests of the city.''
   Police Chief LeRoy Martin will withhold comment until he has
reviewed the decree, said spokeswoman Jackie Kimber.
   Before 1973, women were not hired for the department's patrol
force, prompting a spate of individual legal actions. Black and
Hispanic males had charged in similar lawsuits that police
department hiring and promotion tests had a discriminatory effect.
   The federal government consolidated the complaints in 1973,
making itself the plaintiff.
   Marshall, who presided over the case, ruled in 1976 that the
city violated the equal-opportunity provisions of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
   The proposed decree requires the city to establish an
interest-bearing fund of $9.2 million for reimbursements to
discrimination victims.
   The decree covers:
   _ 233 women on the 1972 policewoman eligibility list who were
hired or reclassified as police officers and who passed probation,
or who were employed before March 24, 1972, as policewomen or
matrons and were subsequently reclassified as police officers.
   _ 455 black and Hispanic men who applied for the 1968 or 1971
patrol officers eligibility lists and were hired from March 24,
1972, to Dec. 31, 1978, as patrolmen or police officers from those
lists, and who paased probation.
   _ The first three women promoted to sergeant after March 24,
1972, who served as policewomen or matrons in 1968 or before that
time.
   _ The first 38 black and Hispanic men who applied for promotion
to sergeant in 1968 and who were promoted to that rank from March
24, 1972, to Dec. 31, 1973.

   Kevin Costner and James Earl Jones will
star in the movie ``Shoeless Joe,'' about the disgraced baseball
great ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, a producer says.
   The movie is based on a novel by W.P. Kinsella about a ghostly
return by Jackson, said associate producer Brian Frankish, who
produced the ``Max Headroom'' TV series and the movie ``The Boy Who
Could Fly.''
   ``We have a really magical film here,'' Frankish said at a news
conference Monday.
   Frankish, Gov. Terry Branstad and Dubuque Area Chamber of
Commerce officials toasted the film with champagne glasses of
Dubuque Star Brewery's Erlanger beer.
   Jackson, a Chicago White Sox player, was kicked out of major
league baseball for his part in the 1919 ``Black Sox'' scandal
after an investigation found that the team threw the series to the
Cincinnati Reds on the orders of gamblers.
   Filming in the Dubuque area will begin after Memorial Day,
Frankish said.

   The Rhine River stopped just short of
pouring into a section of Cologne today, and two people in Bavaria
apparently died when another flooded river swept away their vehicle.
   The Rhine stabilized at 32.3 feet. At 32.5 feet, the river would
have entered Cologne's low-lying old town area. Experts predicted
the Rhine floodwaters will slowly begin to recede.
   Rescue workers searched today for a Volkswagen bus with two
people that witnesses said was swept away by the flooded Main river
in the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg, where streets along the banks of
the river were inundated.
   Police said the witnesses reported seeing the headlights of the
vehicle in the floodwaters and heard cries for help. The vehicle
had disappeared by the time rescue workers arrived in boats, police
said.
   Over the weekend and on Monday, rising waters in Bavaria forced
the evacuation of thousands of residents and farm animals. On
Monday, the Danube river burst through dikes in at least five
locations, causing the region's worst flooding in 70 years,
authorities said.
   If the death of the two people in Wuerzburg is confirmed, the
flood-related death toll would climb to five. An elderly man died
Monday after suffering a heart attack in the flooded upper Bavarian
town of Straubing, and a 61-year-old Koblenz man and 3-year-old boy
from Bamberg died over the weekend.
   In Bavaria, 3,500 residents were evacuated from homes near
Straubing, 30 miles north of Munich, late Sunday and early Monday.
   At least 2,500 cows, pigs, and other farm animals were also
taken to higher grounds as floodwaters spilled into the farms and
pastures of upper Bavaria.
   ``If the rain does not stop soon, this could get much worse,''
Hans Voggenreiter, a Straubing official, told The Associated Press
on Monday. He said residents were evacuated by rowboats, powerboats
and ``whatever was available.'' He added: ``Most were taken in by
relatives and friends. The rest are being cared for in schools and
public auditoriums.''
   Nearly 900 volunteers worked throughout the day Monday filling
sandbags and shoring up the earthen dams that line the Danube near
Straubing, Regensburg and other upper Bavarian towns.
   Floodwaters had also entered parts of the ancient city of
Regensburg, as well as sections of Passau, 80 miles to the east.
   Officials said flooding along the Neckar and Mosel rivers was
receding, but the Rhine continued to climb.
   The rising Rhine forced authorities to close parts of a major
highway between Mainz and Koblenz on Monday, and disrupted train
traffic through the valley. Travellers reported delays of several
hours for some trains, and said others were rerouted away from
riverside tracks.
   Riverside sidewalks and some streets in Bonn, the federal
capital, had disappeared beneath the Rhine's floodwaters.
   Residents of the large villas that line the Rhine at the Bonn
district of Bad Godesberg, home to many embassies and ambassadors'
residents, were using pumps to dry out their flooded cellars and
preparing sandbags.

   Evening came, and then the people were in
the little room apart, drinking wine and reading, drinking and
reading for hours that night. It was good wine and good reading.
   It was not exactly Ernest Hemingway, but a spirited review of
loving parodies of the famed novelist's crisp, masculine style.
   One of the literary lampoons, chosen from 21 finalists by a
dozen well-lubricated judges, won the Eleventh International
Imitation Hemingway Competition on Monday.
   ``It was now morning, and he was in the bathroom shaving,
shaving for the first time that day, but not the last; no, never
the last,'' begins the winning entry, which ends with a groanworthy
pun.
   The parody by Gordon ``Satch'' Carlson of Anchorage, Alaska, met
the key rule of the lighthearted contest: to sound like Hemingway
and read like Hemingway. To ``know that funny is good and very
funny is very good.''
   Carlson, a high school English teacher, newspaper and magazine
columnist and self-described ``social gadfly,'' said in a telephone
interview that he had no trouble imitating Hemingway's distinctive
style.
   ``Actually, I've been accused of writing Hemingway parodies when
I'm not trying,'' he said.
   Carlson's work continued: ``The hairs kept coming, tiny hairs
and black and there was nothing for it, nothing for it at all but
shaving ....''
   The 350-word parody went on and on, discussing the hirsute
portions of a man's body. It then described an estranged woman,
then more shaving, drinking wine, and then drinking more wine.
   The climax came when the man cut himself.
   ``She turned, lifting her thin American lip over those thin,
white, perfect, American teeth, and that thin American sneer. `It's
only a nick, Adams,' she said.' ''
   Nick Adams was a character in several of Hemingway's short
stories.
   Carlson maintains that Hemingway's short stories, rather than
his novels, are key to the writer's work. He said most of the lines
for his parody came from his favorite Hemingway story, ``The Short
Happy Life of Francis Macomber.''
   Carlson, who was vacationing in Seattle when he learned he won,
gets a round trip for two to Italy, with dinners at Harry's Bar in
Florence.
   The other 20 finalists, each straining the language to produce
literary lookalikes of Hemingway's terse, manly style, were among
2,432 entries from all 50 states and more than a dozen foreign
countries.
   The judges included authors Ray Bradbury, Barnaby Conrad and
Cyra McFadden and poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti. It was the first time
the contest was held outside Los Angeles.
   One would-be Hemingway wrote, ``The president looked at the
woman he called Nancy ... other men also called her Nancy.''
   Sticking to the political season, another contestant told how in
the spring, a fellow named Gary ``took the young woman to the
Bahamas, avoiding reporters and living on rum and sun and the catch
of the day ... he had not taken his wife.''
   Another competitor was taken with a large fellow named Jose, ``a
fellow who could laugh in such a large way when the bird sat on his
cigar, (a) cigar the size of a monkey's arm.''
   One entry dealt with ``A Farewell To Arms, Legs, Feet and
Neck,'' while another sought glitter in ``A Farewell to Lunch.''

   Emmy award-winning writer Albert Schwartz,
who created scripts for such TV and radio shows as ``The Bob Hope
Show,'' ``Here's Lucy,'' and ``Gilligan's Island,'' died of
complications from emphysema. He was 77.
   Schwartz, who died Saturday, was part of the original writing
team for ``The Bob Hope Show,'' when it went on radio in 1938.
   His first TV credits came in 1955 for ``The Milton Berle Show''
and ``December Bride.''
   He later wrote for ``Gilligan's Island'' and three television
movies based on the series. He also wrote for ``Petticoat
Junction,'' ``Chico and the Man,'' ``Good Times'' and ``The Brady
Bunch.''
   Schwartz, nominated twice for Emmys, shared the award in 1961
for his work on several episodes of ``The Red Skelton Show.''
   He is survived by his wife, Mimi, two sons, two daughters, six
grandchildren and two brothers.

   Gunmen killed a Japanese nightclub
owner today, and the military said it captured two top communist
rebel leaders during an early morning raid on a hideout in suburban
Manila.
   The military, meanwhile, was on alert to guard against attacks
by communist guerrillas marking their army's 19th anniversary.
   Police said Akihiro Sato, was shot near Manila airport. He was
taken to a nearby hospital where he died of bullet wounds in the
neck and shoulder.
   Police Pvt. 1st Class Bert Hipolito said investigators had no
idea who Sato's killers were. A Japanese friend of the victim who
declined to be identified told reporters at the hospital that Sato,
48, was a native of Tsuchiura City in Japan's Ibaraki Prefecture,
where he owned a nightclub.
   The source said Sato frequently visited Manila on business trips
and was to have returned to Japan today. He arrived March 20 and
was reported to have a Filipino wife. The Japanese Embassy said it
was trying to obtain more information and could make no further
comment.
   Armed forces chief Gen. Renato de Villa told a news conference
today that authorities captured Rafael Baylosis, secretary-general
of the Communist Party of the Philippines, and Benjamin de Vera,
central committee member in charge of operations on Mindanao, the
country's second largest island.
   ``This is certainly a big loss to the Communist Party of the
Philippines because these are very high-ranking personalities who
have been subject of many manhunts and many operations in the
past,'' de Villa said.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, overall commander of security
forces in the capital, said the two were arrested during a raid on
a hideout at the Manila suburb of San Juan early today.
   Armed forces spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said the military was
on alert today in anticipation of possible rebel attacks. The alert
covered five regions, including Manila, northern, southern and
central Luzon and parts of the central Philippine Visayas islands.
   President Corazon Aquino told reporters she ordered Executive
Secretary Catalino Macaraig to summon the mayors of 13 towns and
four cities that comprise the Philippine capital to a meeting to
plan safety measures.
   No major rebel attacks were reported today, but reports of
attacks in the countryside often take days to reach Manila.
   The 24,000-strong New People's Army, part of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines, traditionally observes its
founding anniversary by attacking government installations and
executing ``enemies of the people.''

   Iraq today said its warplanes attacked
two supertankers off Iran in the Persian Gulf and threatened to use
chemical weapons against major Iranian cities.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a
military spokesman as saying Iraqi warplanes hit two ``very large
maritime targets,'' or supertankers, off the Iran coast during the
night.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the report, which
provided no other details. News of Iraqi raids in Iranian tankers
are difficult to verify because of an Iranian news blackout on such
incidents.
   Nuri Nayef, director of the Cairo office of the Iraqi News
Agency, today said an ``authorized Iraqi spokesman'' told him
``Iraq might choose a number of large Iranian cities to be the
targets of chemical weapons as a deterrent and punitive measure.''
   Nayef, who spoke to reporters in Cairo, said the unidentified
spokesman said Iran deployed chemical weapons in Iraq's
northeastern Kurdistan region and that Iraq may respond to stop the
Iranians from doing so again.
   Iran claims Iraq dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs on three
towns in Kurdistan, killing 5,000 Kurds and injuring 5,000. The
attacks on the town of Halabja and the nearby villages of Khormal
and Dojaila reportedly began March 16 and continued over the next
few days.
   Western reporters have seen victims of chemical weapons at
hospitals in Halabja, which they visited with Iranian guides, and
in Tehran. Survivors told them chemical bombs were dropped by
Iraqi, not Iranian, planes.
   Kurdistan is where the majority of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds
live. Most of them have been fighting the Baghdad government for
autonomy in the mountainous region. They are backed by Iran.
   Baghdad has neither confirmed nor denied the use of the outlawed
weapons. But a statement by Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command
Council on Saturday said Iraq has the right to defend itself ``with
all available weapons.''
   On Monday, the official Islamic Republic News Agency, also
monitored in Nicosia, said Iran's Revolutionary Guards had killed
or wounded 300 Iraqis in the latest battle of an Iranian thrust
into the Kurdistan region.
   The news agency quoted Revolutionary Guards Minister Mohsen
Rafiq-Doust as saying the Iranians have overrun 540 square miles of
the region.
   The Iranians also have pushed 15 miles into the Darbandikhan
region, east of Iraq's Kirkuk oilfields, communiques said.
   Iran claims to have killed or wounded nearly 13,500 Iraqis,
captured more than 5,000 and destroyed 225 tanks and armored
vehicles since March 16.
   Iraq has admitted losing territory in Kurdistan.
   But if the Iranian claim is confirmed, it would mark Iraq's
biggest military setback since the Iranians battled to within six
miles of the southern city of Basra early last year and occupied
wetlands east of it.
   Iran also claimed its air force fighters downed two Iraqi
warplanes in the Kurdistan battle zone Monday. Iraq admitted losing
only one aircraft.
   In another development, rebels fighting Iran's government with
backing from Iraq said Monday their National Liberation Army
launched a major offensive on a 15-mile front in Iran's
southwestern Khuzestan province near the town of Shush.
   Iran acknowledged the attack, but said more than 1,000 Iraqi
soldiers and NLA ``counter-revolutionaries'' were killed and the
advanced was foiled.

   Six people were killed and one was
injured when a group of young West German skiers and their guide
were buried by an avalanche in the Jam Valley of Tyrol province,
authorities said.
   The accident happened Monday morning, but authorities did not
become aware of it until late in the afternoon because all
electricity and telephone lines to the area had been interrupted by
another avalanche, a police spokesman from the area told Austrian

   The spokesman said the six people dug out of the snow were
already dead and a seventh was injured. No names of the skiers

<TEXT>
   A former president of Venezuela will
fly to Panama to ask the Roman Catholic archbishop to try to
mediate an end to the crisis over the strongman-rule of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica and Spanish Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez told a news conference Monday they would ask
Panamanian Monsignor Marco Antonio McGrath to seek a peaceful
solution to Panama's devastating political and economic situation.
   They said former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez will
go to Panama to present the request to McGrath. No schedule was
given.
   Arias, Gonzalez and Perez met Sunday and Monday in the resort of
Guanamara, 220 miles north of San Jose.
   Gonzalez is on a four-day visit to Costa Rica. He said Noriega
has not sought asylum in Spain, but if he does it will be granted
with the assurance he would not be extradicted to the United States
where he is under a federal indictment in Flordia on charges of
drug trafficking.
   The Spanish leader told the news conference an ``immediate
solution is necessary to end the anguish and the pain of the
Panamanian people and we believe that if Archbishop McGrath agrees
to mediate, it would be a very important point.''
   He said he and Arias ``are reasonably optimistic that there will
be a rapid solution in Panama.''
   Arias said he wanted McGrath ``to serve as mediator ... not only
between the Civic Crusade and President Manuel Solis Palma but also
with all the political parties to find a solution to the crisis in
Panama.''
   The National Civic Crusade is a coalition of about 200 business,
professional, student and union groups. It has been trying since
June to force Noriega to step down as commander of the
15,000-member Defense Forces that includes the armed forces and
police. Arias also said Noriega should resign from the post, which
the general has used to dominate the government.
   Noriega picked Solis Palma as the new chief execuive on Feb. 26,
the day after President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried to fire Noriega
and instead was ousted from office. Delvalle is living in hiding in
Panama and is still recognized by the United States as the
country's legal president.
   Arias won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize as author of a peace plan
signed last August by the presidents of the five Central American
countries, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa
Rica, designed to end regional conflicts.

   A day in February when millions of Britons wore
red clown noses reaped $25 million for British and African
charities, organizers said.
   ``Comic Relief Day'' was held for the first time on Feb. 5, and
accompanied by a seven-hour ``laughathon'' on television, which
raised the bulk of donations through telephone pledges.
   Two million donors also paid nearly $1 each for a red nose.
Bankers in pin stripes, school children, secretaries and others
wearing the bulbous badge were a common sight. Even Prince Andrew,
second son of Queen Elizabeth II, posed for photographers in a red
nose.
   Organizers on Monday said the funds would be used to help famine
victims in Africa and poor youths in Britain.

<HEAD>Low-Calorie Diet Shown to Prolong Rats' Lives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS P. WYMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists seeking to explain the longer
lifespan of rats fed low-calorie diets are not recommending that
people follow such a strict regimen, but merely that they eat
sensibly.
   ``I think the studies support the wisdom of what is commonly
referred to as a prudent diet,'' said Dr. Richard Weindruch of the
National Institute on Aging. ``Don't overload yourself with
calories.''
   Scientists from a range of disciplines gathered Monday at the
University of Notre Dame to analyze a study in which about 200 rats
fed 30 percent fewer calories than a similar-sized group lived an
average of 20 percent longer. The conference continues through
today.
   While the link between a restricted diet and longer life is
long-established, the researchers are trying to find out why diet
tends to slow down the aging process.
   An immunologist suggested suggested lower food intake kept the
animals' immune systems strong. Other results were less conclusive,
but Weindruch cautioned against issuing hasty advice.
   ``The studies at present do not justify a recommendation to the
general public of severe caloric restriction, or even moderate
caloric restriction, because there are so many difficulties in
translation between the animal model and the human situation,'' he
said.
   Immunology researcher Dr. Yoon Kim of Chicago speculated that
the restricted diet may have exposed the rats to fewer antigens _
or disease-causing agents in the food _ to which the immune system
reacts by producing antibodies.
   ``In a restricted diet, the tendency is not to use up'' the
immune system's ability to fight disease, said Kim. ``Life, and
healthy life, is due to restriction of diet, maintaining the
potential of the defense system, not using it unnecessarily.''
   Thirty-two researchers in the United States and Canada were sent
tissue samples for analysis from the 400 rats raised at Notre
Dame's Lobund Laboratory in a study supported by the Chicago-based,
non-profit Retirement Research Foundation.
   The study involved 400 rats, half of which were fed 12 grams of
food per day, or about 70 percent of normal, with fat limited to 5
percent.
   Animals on restricted diet lived an average of 38 months, an
increase of nearly 20 percent above the control group, scientists
said.
   The rats on restricted diets were healthier in their old age and
developed fewer cancers of the prostate and liver. The rats also
suffered less disease of the heart and brain and had
better-functioning immune systems, scientists said.
   Dr. Gilbert Boissonneault, a clinical nutritionist from the
University of Kentucky, said he found no difference in body fat
content between the two groups of rats.
   Dr. Gibbons Cornwell III, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth
College, found extensive weakening of heart muscle in all rats, but
less in the diet-restricted animals.
   Additional studies will look at the glandular system and
gastrointestinal tract.

Coasts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two unarmed Tomahawk cruise
missiles flew 800 miles over rural Florida and Alabama in a
simulated ship-to-land attack, then parachuted down to a test
range, a Navy spokesman said.
   The missiles, 18 feet long and 21 inches around, were fired from
Navy destroyers in the Gulf of Mexico, according to Bob Holsapple,
a spokesman for the Cruise Missile Project in Washington.
   ``These were the eighth and ninth successful tests over the
Florida and Alabama test range,'' he said Monday. ``The flight
route took the missiles over sparsely and non-populated areas
only.''
   The exact course of the missiles and the identity of the ships
they were fired from was classified, he said.
   The missiles, fired at 10 a.m. CST Sunday and 3 p.m. CST Monday,
traveled at 500 mph at altitudes varying from 500 to 6,000 feet. It
took one hour and 45 minutes to complete the tests, Holsapple said.
   Seconds after being launched from the destroyers, the missiles
dropped their solid-fuel rocket boosters and switched to their
cruise missile engine.
   They flew ``a fully-guided test flight over approximately 800
miles over portions of Florida and Alabama and then terminated at
the Eglin Air Force Base test range,'' he said.
   The Tomahawks were guided to Florida's west coast by their
on-board navigation system. Once over land, their guidance system
adjusted course using an on-board computerized ``terrain contour
matching system,'' Holsapple said.
   The Tomahawk cruise missile, which is designed to fly close to
the ground to avoid radar detection, is deployed on destroyers,
cruisers, battleships and attack submarines.

   Horacio Martinez-Baca was a labor union
lawyer in Argentina when the military took control there 12 years
ago. Six days after the coup, Martinez-Baca was arrested and began
a four-year nightmare of imprisonment and torture.
   ``They laid me down on a table. They tied my arms and legs. They
put electric shocks on my genitals and my gums, and they asked who
were my friends,'' Martinez-Baca testified Monday.
   A few feet away in the hushed courtroom sat Carlos Suarez Mason,
64, a former general who oversaw the military prisons in which
Martinez-Baca was held.
   ``The prisoners used to call him the lord of death and life,''
Martinez-Baca said.
   The former prisoner, testifying in a $10 million lawsuit against
Suarez Mason, said the 90-minute torture session occurred about a
month after he was arrested in March 1976 and was repeated several
times before his release in April 1980.
   There were also beatings, freezing showers, death threats, and
``probably the worst torture,'' solitary confinement in an
unheated, windowless cell for days at a time, he said.
   Suarez Mason, former commander of the First Army Corps in Buenos
Aires, was arrested in January 1987 at his home in Foster City,
just south of San Francisco, more than three years after fleeing
Argentina.
   He faces extradition on charges of 43 murders and 23
kidnappings, allegedly committed by soldiers under his command from
1976 to 1979 during a military campaign against suspected leftists.
   The civil suit by Martinez-Baca is one of three by Argentinians
now living in the United States who say they were imprisoned and
tortured, or their relatives were killed, by Suarez Mason's forces.
   U.S. courts have allowed suits against foreigners in their
jurisdiction for certain types of human rights violations,
including torture, prolonged detention and summary execution.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti declared a default March 15
after the former general failed to respond to the suit or answer
pre-trial questions, claiming he had spent his last $100,000 on
lawyers in the extradition case. The judge ruled that the trial
would be limited to the amount in damages Suarez Mason must pay.
   At Monday's session, San Francisco attorney Ray Archuleta
appeared and said he was representing Suarez Mason, who declared he
was now willing to answer questions. But Conti said Suarez Mason
had no right to take part in a hearing after a default and ordered
Archuleta to the back of the courtroom.
   Martinez-Baca, a former local government official in Mendoza,
Argentina, said his nearly blind father, a former state governor,
was arrested along with his mother and brother on the day the
military took power. Six days later, two plainclothes police
arrested him in his apartment.
   He said he was never told why he was beng held.
   One of the most frightening events of his imprisonment was being
flown from one military prison to another. He had heard about other
prisoners thrown out of helicopters alive, Martinez-Baca said.
Another time, when he was led away for interrogation and torture,
his jailers told him to say his last words and acted as if he would
be killed, he said.
   The military finally allowed him to leave the country in 1980
just as Argentina's Supreme Court was about to order his release,
Martinez-Baca said. He arrived at the home of a sponsoring
Presbyterian minister in Berkeley speaking no English, separated
from his family and about 70 pounds lighter than when he was
imprisoned, he said.
   Though he still fears retaliation from the Argentine military,
he said, he filed the suit as ``a deterrent for people who think
they are the master of life and death.''

   President Corazon Aquino's chief
housekeeper died of cancer today with a weeping president at her
bedside, the presidential palace announced.
   Mrs. Aquino stayed by Priscilla Ruiz Aragon's side for two hours
until she died at the suburban Makati Medical Center, according to
Special Presidential Assistant Flerida Ruth Romero. Mrs. Aragon was
55.
   The president, her eyes swollen from crying, refused to talk to
reporters when she returned to the presidential palace from the
hospital.
   Mrs. Aragon, popularly called Fritz, was known for the exacting
way she ran the president's household. A wealthy socialite, she was
formerly associated with deposed President Ferdinand Marcos' wife,
Imelda, but later broke with the Marcoses.
   She was survived by her husband, Francisco. The couple had no
children.

<HEAD>Palestinians Protest Army Closure Of West Bank And Gaza</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Arabs wounded, other violence,
details of closure. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army today sealed the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in the toughest crackdown since
demonstrations began four months ago. Palestinians tossed gasoline
bombs and set tires ablaze in protest.
   The army rounded up Palestinians after the three-day closure
went into effect, arresting 600, Israel radio said. The army
confirmed it was making mass arrests, but declined to give figures.
   Israeli troops set up roadblocks to bar nearly all journalists,
Israeli civilians and Arab visitors from the territories, seized by
Israel in the 1967 war. The army said it wounded seven Palestinians
on the West Bank.
   The crackdown was seen as a test of the military's ability to
control the territories where, according to U.N. figures, 119
Palestinians and one Israeli soldier have been killed since Dec. 8.
   It was most severe in the Gaza Strip, where the 650,000 Arab
residents were ordered confined to their homes from 10 p.m. Monday
night until 3 a.m. Friday. Telephone links were also cut.
   In the West Bank, where 850,000 Arabs live, the bridges to
Jordan were left open for incoming traffic, telephones were
operating and residents were allowed to travel within their towns
or villages. No Arabs were allowed to go to Jordan, however.
   The closure, ordered by the Cabinet on Sunday night, did not
affect the 65,000 Jewish settlers living in the occupied
territories.
   Robert Slater, president of the Foreign Press Association, said
the group appealed today to the Supreme Court to overturn the
closure order.
   Slater said the association and Israel's 2,000 member
Journalists Association had decided not to participate in
army-provided news pools into the territories.
   But an American television network and some Israeli newspapers
agreed to take part in pool coverage today.
   One Israeli reporter and foreign television crew accompanied the
army into the West Bank and another into Gaza.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the measures were taken to
forestall large-scale Palestinian demonstrations on Land Day on
Wednesday. The day marks the 12th anniversary of a clash over land
confiscation. Six Arabs were shot to death by soldiers on March 30,
1976.
   Many Israelis say they believe news coverage of the Palestinian
unrest gives a one-sided view and hurts Israel's image. There have
been calls to restrict television coverage by those who contend the
presence of TV cameras incites the protesters.
   In the West Bank village of Zaita today, 40 miles northwest of
Jerusalem, hundreds of Palestinians threw gasoline bombs and
clashed with soldiers, the army said. An army spokesman reported
seven Arabs wounded by army gunfire.
   In the Gaza Strip, violent protests broke out as soon as
Palestinians learned of the curfew, Israel army radio said. In
Jabaliya refugee camp, troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse youths who set tires ablaze, the radio said.
   Troops turned away the car of Save the Children director Chris
George at a roadblock outside Ramallah, despite an army annoucement
that the closure would not affect international relief workers.
   George said the restrictions had seriously disrupted his
agency's operations, with half the Jerusalem staff of 10 relief
workers denied entry into the city.
   Mona Rishmawi, an attorney at Law in the Service of Man, a human
rights group founded by Palestinian lawyers, said Israeli troops
had forcibly closed the major West Bank markets in Jenin and
Jericho as well as in Gaza City.
   In Ramallah, soldiers today forced merchants, sometimes at
gunpoint, to close their stores.
   The action was done to defy the PLO, which had ordered the
stores opened for three hours a day. In earlier protests, the PLO
had ordered the markets closed. At that time, Israeli soldiers
forced them open.
   ``Three days is nothing. We can go three months,'' one
70-year-old man told The Associated Press as he watched the
soldiers. He declined to give his name.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the armed forces chief of staff, was
quoted by the state-owned Israel radio as saying the closure order
may be extended beyond three days if necessary.
   Rabin said the territories were declared ``a closed military
zone.''
   ``The meaning is (to bar) all those who don't have to be there
or there's no vital reason why they have to move around there,'' he
told soldiers in remarks aired Monday by Israel army radio.

   As Vice President George Bush's grip on the
Republican presidential nomination tightens, more and more people
are asking the No. 2 question:
   Whom will he choose as his running mate?
   Bush says it's too early to think about it.
   Former President Richard Nixon suggests White House chief of
staff Howard H. Baker Jr. Baker says he doesn't expect to be asked
because he wouldn't bring the right strength to the ticket.
   Others propose California Gov. George Deukmejian. Deukmejian
says he couldn't accept because he would leave his state in the
hands of a Democratic lieutenant governor.
   Nixon, in a forthcoming London Sunday Times political column,
says the ideal formula is to pick your principal rival, as
President Reagan did with Bush. But, he suggests, maybe the
campaign between Bush and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole has been
too bitter for that.
   Some have another idea: not principal rival, but wife of
principal rival. How about former Secretary of Transportation
Elizabeth Dole?
   And so it goes.
   Nixon argues that Baker, a Tennessean and former Senate
Republican leader, would be helpful in Southern states and in
dealing with Congress.
   In a recent television interview, Baker said, ``George Bush
needs to find someone who will bring strength to the ticket on a
regional and political basis, and I think that is not going to be
me.''
   He didn't say he would turn it down. ``If someone asked me to do
it,'' he said, ``I would have a very difficult time trying to
figure out what I was going to say.'' But, he added, ``I do not
wish that to happen.''
   Baker has mentioned former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
Deukmejian of California, New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean and former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh as good choices for the vice
presidential slot.
   If Deukmejian left office in mid-term, Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy,
a Democrat, would become governor of the nation's largest state. At
a news conference in Sacramento recently, the California governor
said, ``Even if they did ask me to accept the vice presidential
nomination, I wouldn't be able to take it.'' Later, he added,
``That doesn't mean I wouldn't like to be vice president.''
   Another possibility: Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who ran as a
conservative alternative to Bush for the presidential nomination
but fared poorly.
   Also mentioned is Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. She was on a
long list of potential Reagan running mates in 1980 but took
herself out of consideration because, as a freshman senator, she
said she didn't have enough experience. She has eight years more of
it now.
   If Bush should decide to choose a Midwesterner, to strengthen
the ticket in a region that could be crucial to Republican hopes,
another possibility would be Illinois Gov. James Thompson, who
endorsed the vice president and campaigned for him in the Illinois
presidential primary.
   Other names that have been mentioned include Sen. Alan Simpson
of Wyoming, Dole's deputy in the Senate leadership; Secretary of
Education William J. Bennett; Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, an
architect of the congressional deficit-reduction mechanism; and
Colin Powell, the president's national security adviser and one of
the top-ranking blacks in the Reagan administration.
   All of this, of course, assumes that the vice president wins the
nomination. He is way ahead, and Dole said last week, ``I think
it's probably a foregone conclusion what's happening on the
Republican side.''
   Bush, asked whether he would consider Dole as a running mate,
said: ``It's too early for me to start thinking about any running
mates. That would project a certain arrogance or presumption that I
don't want to do.''

<HEAD>Genetic Engineering Opponent Offers New Argument</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Another genetically engineered pesticide is
jumping through the usual regulatory hoops and the usual opponent
of the technology, Jeremy Rifkin, is throwing up a novel argument
against it.
   Rifkin, whose campaign against genetic engineering has delayed
some field tests of the organisms, says the proposed biological
pesticide will cause a decline in corn yields.
   The decline, he claims, is an adverse environmental effect and
reason to deny the developer, Crop Genetics Inc. of Dorsey, Md.,
permission to run field tests.
   The company says its planned product is unique among biological
and genetically engineered pesticides in that it aims to
``vaccinate'' the plant against attack by the target pest _ the
corn borer, a kind of caterpillar. It works inside the plant's
vascular system, and does not change the plant or the pest
genetically.
   For that reason, the company calls it the ``InCide'' technique.
   In a sign of the increasing importance of genetic engineering
techniques in farming, the Agriculture Department said Monday it
would license SyntroVet, Inc. of Lenexa, Kan., to market the
nation's third genetically engineered vaccine to control
pseudorabies in swine, a contagious disease that can be deadly to
newborn pigs but does not affect humans.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said safety and effectiveness had
been shown in field trials on 400 animals in three states, and
there is ``no significant impact on the human environment.''
   When Crop Genetics told reporters last week that its organism
causes no significant change in yields, ``They lied ... and you can
quote me,'' Rifkin said.
   The company's chief scientist, Peter Carlson, was asked about
Rifkin's assertion and statements in support of it. Carlson said
Rifkin did not quote the relevant sections of the company's
application for testing permits.
   Some tests using the carrier organism without the pesticide have
shown crop declines, notably of 17 percent in Florida test plots,
but the ``usual statistical tests that scientists use show there is
not a significant difference'' from untreated corn, Carlson said.
   And even if there is a decline, the company insists that's not
an environmental effect or a reason to deny permits. ``If we cause
a significant decline in yields, no farmer is going to buy our
product,'' Carlson said. ``Rifkin is grabbing at any argument he
can.''
   It may well be true that corn will show a small decline in
yields, he said. But a farmer might accept that if he could achieve
a large decline in costs.
   The corn borer causes $400 million in crop damage, even after
farmers spend about $50 million on chemical pesticides, the company
said. The borer can reduce yields 20 percent in some corn belt
areas.
   The company's technique uses a harmless bacterium to carry the
toxin that kills the borer. Carlson has selected one that's found
normally only in Bermuda grass _ Clavibacter xyli, subspecies
cynodontis, or Cxc. Cows have been eating it for centuries.
   The toxin is produced by a gene in another bacterium. That gene,
using the techniques of recombinant DNA, is inserted into Cxc. The
modified Cxc is injected into the seed and will exist in the corn
plant's vascular system, its new gene directing the manufacture of
the protein toxin in the cell.
   When the borer eats the corn leaf or stem tissue, it also
gobbles the toxin.
   If the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agriculture
Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service approve,
the company hopes to run field tests in Queen Anne's County,
Maryland and at the department's Beltsville, Md. research station
this year. It also has applied to test in France.
   The company has asked that EPA waive some suggested toxicity
tests, tests it says are not necessary in the light of results from
other tests. Rifkin is attacking the application on this grounds
too, arguing that all the tests should be performed.
   In its campaign for public understanding and acceptance of the
field experiments, Crop Genetics has lined up heavyweights on an
advisory board that include two former administrators of the
Environmental Protection Agency, William Ruckelshaus and Douglas
Costle, and Elliot L. Richardson, a former attorney general and
secretary of several Cabinet agencies.

   Troops firing shotguns, tear gas and
water cannon routed thousands of anti-government marchers, then
stormed a hotel to arrest opposition activists and journalists.
   Several people were injured and dozens were arrested, witnesses
said.
   Monday's march through the city shut down by a general strike
was one of the largest protests in months against Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega. About 10,000 people turned the city center into a
sea of waving white handkerchiefs, the trademark of those demanding
the strongman's ouster.
   A few hours after the march was broken up, plainclothes agents,
army troops and police burst into the lobby of the Marriott Hotel
in the southeast part of the city. Firing shots in the air, they
came in the front and the back, smashing one of the glass doors.
   Leaders of the opposition National Civic Crusade, which
sponsored the march and has been using the hotel as a headquarters,
scattered down hallways and up stairwells. But the troopers caught
many of them and hustled them out.
   The hotel is also the headquarters for most of the international
press corps. The security agents forced their way at gunpoint into
the offices there of NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN. Tapes, including
footage of the day's march, were confiscated and several
journalists were detained.
   An officer on the scene said about 40 people were taken from the
hotel. Most appeared to have been crusade members or journalists.
   Richard Cole, an AP reporter, was one of eight foreign
journalists detained and taken to a downtown military intelligence
center. They spent three hours being searched, questioned and then
lectured to by Maj. Felipe Camargo.
   The seven others were Abidel Vivancos, a Mexican with ABC-TV;
Alfredo Gudino, a Mexican with NBC-TV; Thomas Haley, a U.S.
photographer with the Sipa agency; J.B. Diedrich, a Miami-based
photographer with Contact photos; Maria Cortina, a Mexican with
Mexican and Spanish radio; and Jose Manuel Pintada and Eduardo
Herrera, Mexicans with Spanish television.
   ``We were all extremely worried because of the military campaign
attacking the international press as `disinformers,''' said Cole.
``My notes including interviews with pro- and anti-government
figures were taken and photocopied.''
   The notes were returned upon his release.
   During the demonstration, the crowd chanted ``Justice!'' and
``Noriega, tyrant, Your end is near!'' as it progressed through the
shopping district.
   More than 90 percent of the stores were closed in support of a
general strike now in its second week. The strike's organizers say
it will last until Noriega leaves the country.
   About 1,000 marchers had set out from the meeting place, a
church in the city center. Their ranks swelled rapidly with people
from buildings lining the route. Those who remained in their
apartments leaned out windows waving white towels, clapping and
chanting.
   Suddenly, panicked marchers shouted an incongruous warning.
   ``Smurfs! Smurfs!'' they cried, pressing backward, turning and
running back down the avenue.
   Panamanian police water cannons are inexplicably adorned with
3-foot-tall depictions of the elfin cartoon character, known in
Spanish as ``Pitufos.''
   The vehicles sped toward the crowd spraying a mixture of water
and harsh irritant that blinds those it hits for up to 10 minutes
and burns the skin. It also provokes convulsive coughing.
   Within minutes, the street was empty except for gas-masked
troopers and a few stumbling, sputtering individuals. Police fired
tear gas and birdshot down the avenue and side streets, even though
almost everyone was in flight.
   A middle-aged woman sitting on the sidewalk called to this
reporter. Her leg was snapped just above the ankle, the shattered
shinbone pierced her skin.
   A passing taxi was stopped and the woman, who had tripped and
been trampled, was placed in it for transport to the hospital. The
street was lined with scores of shoes shed as the crowd fled police.
   Denia Quintero de Morales, another middle-aged woman who had
taken part in the march, emerged from an alley a few minutes later,
blood dripping from her gashed head. She too had stumbled and been
trod on in the panic.
   Witnesses said they saw at least 10 people injured in the
stampede. Some of the slower runners were beaten with rubber
truncheons by pursuing riot troops.
   The current phase of Panama's 10-month-old political and
economic crisis began Feb. 26, when Noriega orchestrated the ouster
of President Eric Delvalle. Hours earlier, Delvalle had tried to
fire Noriega.
   Washington continues to recognize Delvalle, who is in hiding.
The Reagan administration has frozen Panamanian government funds in
U.S. banks, denying this country a supply of dollars, the official
Panamanian currency.
   Because banks have been closed for almost four weeks, currency
has become precious and many people are doing without essentials.
Some go hungry.
   Nearly 20 crusade leaders were arrested Monday, either just
after the march was broken up or at the hotel, opposition spokesmen
said. They had not been released by midnight. Some Panamanian
reporters apparently remained in detention past midnight.

<HEAD>Death Sentence Reversed for Vietnam Evidence Exclusion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court threw out a death
sentence against a Vietnam veteran because the sentencing trial
omitted testimony that the killer of two young girls may have been
driven by trauma caused by his wartime experiences.
   The court ruled unanimously Monday that the jury might not have
sentenced Phillip Lucero to death if it had been allowed to hear
the assessment of a veterans' counselor.
   The ruling ordered a new penalty-phase trial with the previously
excluded evidence to decide whether Lucero should be sentenced to
death or life without parole.
   Justice Stanley Mosk, in a separate opinion, went further and
said the court should forbid a death sentence for Lucero.
   ``As his patriotic duty, he killed our enemies efficiently,''
wrote Mosk. ``Unfortunately, after returning home he irrationally
killed again, this time two innocent children. There is macabre
irony in the fact that the society on whose behalf Lucero took an
undetermined number of lives is now seeking to take his life.''
   In the penalty phase of the trial, psychiatrist Edward Conolley
testified that Lucero suffered ``post-traumatic stress,'' including
flashbacks to incidents in which he killed a grenade-wielding
soldier who proved to be an ally and carried rotting corpses from
the battlefield.
   Conolley attributed the murders to Lucero's mental impairment,
compounded by flashbacks that may have been touched off by the
sound of police helicopters and the cackling of a goose outside his
home, because agitated animals in Vietnam often foreshadowed the
approach of unfriendly forces.
   However, then-Superior Court Judge Joseph Campbell barred
testimony by Thomas Wulbrecht, a veteran who runs a counseling
program for Vietnam vets at a veterans' hospital. Based on a
3{-hour conversation with Lucero that did not include the
circumstances of the murders, Wulbrecht said he would have
testified that Lucero probably had been driven by the same stress
syndrome.
   Justice Allen Broussard, in writing for the court, said the jury
should have been allowed to consider the testimony as an argument
favoring leniency. He said it could have been more persuasive than
Conolley's testimony: the prosecution sought to discredit the
psychiatrist as a ``hired gun'' for the defense but could not have
used the same attack on Wulbrecht, Broussard said.
   The court also ruled that Campbell wrongly prevented Conolley
from answering questions about whether Lucero was likely to repeat
his crimes or could adjust to prison, Broussard said.
   Lucero's is the fifth death sentence the court has reversed out
of 16 it has considered since conservatives gained a majority last
year. All of the reversals have been unanimous.
   Lucero, now 42, was convicted of murdering 7-year-old Chris
Hubbard and 10-year-old Teddy Engliman, his neighbors in the town
of Yucaipa in San Bernardino County.
   The girls were last seen at the back of Lucero's lot on an
afternoon in April 1980. A neighbor heard Lucero's goose cackling
and heard Lucero tell the girls, as they entered his yard, that the
goose would not hurt them. After helicopters were called in and a
fire broke out in Lucero's house, the girls' bodies were found in a
nearby trash container, one beaten, the other strangled.
   The Supreme Court upheld the murder convictions, saying Lucero's
approach to the girls and their accompanying him into his yard
would allow the jury to conclude reasonably that the killings were
premeditated.
   After a turbulent childhood, Lucero lied about his age, joined
the Army at 16 and served three tours of combat in Vietnam,
receiving a Purple Heart and a Combat Infantry Badge.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Off-the-road users of diesel would be exempted
from payment of the 15.1-cent federal tax on April 1 under a Senate
Finance Committee amendment offered today.
   The committee had approved the exemption last week but, because
of budget restrictions, made the change effective Oct. 1. That
would have required farmers, fishermen and other off-road users to
pay the tax for six months and then apply for a rebate early next
year.
   Most of these users traditionally have been exempt from paying
the tax. A 1987 law that goes into effect April 1 requires that
they pay the tax and later apply for a refund.
   In introducing the new proposal today, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, said that exempting
off-road users April 1 instead of Oct. 1 could be paid for by
revising the requirements for corporations to make estimated
income-tax payments.
   It is up to the House Ways and Means Committee, where tax bills
must originate, to determine whether the diesel provision is
changed. That panel has given no indication when it will consider
the proposal, meaning there is little chance it could become law by
April 1.

   Suspected Sikh militants sprayed a
wedding party with rifle fire, killing 10 people, and fatally shot
seven other people elsewhere in the northern Punjab state, police
said today.
   Among the victims of the suspected guerrillas were the bride and
bridegroom and four children aged 1 to 5 who were with the wedding
party, authorities said.
   Five Sikhs were slain in attacks in Gurdaspur and Kapurthala
districts, according to police in Chandigarh, the Punjab capital.
Two Hindus were also shot dead in Jalandhar in the attacks late
Monday and today, they said.
   Four men armed with AK-47 assault rifles opened fire at random
Monday night on the Sikh wedding party of about 20 people in the
village of Johramadan, 18 miles south of Amritsar, police said.
   The attackers escaped, leaving behind a note that claimed the
victims were police informers. It was signed ``Khalistan Liberation
Force,'' according to Police Superintendent Izhar Alam.
   Khalistan is the name Sikh militants use for the independent
nation they demand be created in Punjab.
   The latest deaths raised to more than 560 the number of people
killed in attacks in Punjab blamed on Sikh militants since the
beginning of the year.
   The Sikhs, whose religion combines Hinduism and Islam, make up
about 2 percent of India's population. They are a majority,
however, in the rich farming state of Punjab. The militants say
they need a separate nation to protect their faith from domination
by Hindus, who are more than 80 percent of India's people.

   The execution of a man condemned for
murdering a sheriff's deputy can go forward Wednesday, an appellate
court said, but lawyers for the man said they will appeal to the
Supreme Court.
   John Henry Selvage, 37, is scheduled to be executed before dawn.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Monday vacated the stay
for Selvage that was granted Friday by U.S. District Judge Norman
Black of Houston.
   Selvage was convicted of capital murder in the death July 30,
1979, of Harris County Sheriff's Deputy Albert Garza.
   Black had granted the reprieve while the appellate court
reconsiders the appeal of another death row inmate from Harris
County, Leon Rutherford King. King is questioning the selection of
jurors during his trial.
   David Cunningham, Selvage's attorney, said he would appeal to
the Surpreme Court today. He said the appeal will be based on
several issues, including instructions to jurors on mitigating
circumstances, a matter the court is considering in the case of
Texas death row inmate Donald Gene Franklin.
   Garza was trying to prevent a robbery at a jewelry store in
Houston but had not drawn his weapon at the time he was shot.
   Selvage has been granted at least four postponements or stays
for scheduled executions.

   A U.S. attorney said city police officers can
be trusted to help investigate charges of corruption on their own
force.
   Affidavits released in federal court here last week revealed
that FBI informants have accused several New Orleans police
officers working in the French Quarter of crimes including drug
dealing, accepting bribes and burglary.
   Some officers will be deputized as federal marshals as part of
an effort to investigate the charges, U.S. Attorney John Volz said
at a news conference Monday.
   Police Superintendent Warren Woodfork wouldn't say who among his
investigators would be deputized. But both he and Volz said they
were confident the deputy marshals would investigate their own
department thoroughly.
   ``We have no reason at all to have any lack of trust in the
superintendent or in anyone he designates,'' said Volz.
   The affidavits unsealed last week were filed by the FBI over two
years to support requests for permission to place wiretaps on
businesses and residences of reputed organized crime figures
believed to be involved in drug smuggling.
   In those affidavits, two unidentified FBI informants are said to
have accused officers of crimes. One officer is accused of selling
cocaine. Another is accused of burglarizing a warehouse.
   An informant also said officers who worked off-duty guard
details for businesses sometimes made questionable arrests at the
behests of their off-duty bosses.

   Residents of a disputed region in the republic of
Azerbaijan shut down their main city for a second day today to
protest the government's refusal to transfer the region to
neighboring Armenia, a newspaper said.
   ``My report today will be short,'' P. Gutiontov, a correspondent
for the government newspaper Izvestia wrote from Stepanakert.
``City enterprises are at standstill, people are home.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov also told a
regular news briefing that some workers in Stepanakert stayed home
from their jobs.
   ``Certain enterprises are not functioning or are partially not
functioning,'' he said.
   Stepanakert is the biggest city in Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in
Azerbaijan which Armenians want annexed to Armenia. Activists said
a general strike began last Wednesday in the mostly Armenian area.
   In a separate report, the afternoon newspaper Izvestia provided
the first breakdown of casualties in Sumgait, an Azerbaijani city
where ethnic rioting broke out Feb. 28. It confirmed the official
death toll of 32, and said 26 of them were Armenians while six were
Azeris.
   Activists have claimed the death toll was much higher.
   Gerasimov said residents of Yerevan, the Armenian capital, went
to work as usual. He reiterated that the government would not be
forced into appeasing Armenian demands to annex Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``We cannot solve the problem by mechanically transferring this
region as some Armenian officials want,'' he said. ``The more you
study this problem the more you will see the whole thing is not as
simple as that, as merely saying Nagorno-Karabakh must be part of
Armenia.''
   Also today, a Moscow dissident said police on Monday evening
broke up a demonstration by more than 50 people who demanded
freedom for a jailed Armenian activist and carried signs saying,
``We don't believe in perestroika.''
   The dissident, Tamara Grigoryants, said she received her
information about the protest in a telephone conversation with
members of a committee promoting Armenian self-determination in
Yerevan.
   Police did not interfere with an earlier demonstration Monday in
Yerevan by more than 100 people, but dispersed the second group,
she said.
   She said her telephone call was interrupted and she could not
find out other details, including whether there were any arrests.
   Both groups demanded freedom for jailed nationalist leader
Paryur Arikyan, she said.
   Arikyan was arrested in Yerevan after being detained by police
in Moscow, where he had provided information to foreign journalists
about events in Armenia. Dissident sources say they have learned he
has been charged under a law prohibiting spreading false
information about the Soviet Union.
   The signs against perestroika were a challenge to Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his broad effort to restructure Soviet
society. The Soviet government last week declared Armenian
agitation for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh intolerable but
released a plan to improve economic and social conditions in the
region.
   Gorbachev has appealed for patience and said that the
policy-making Communist Party Central Committee will discuss the
dispute in an upcoming meeting on relations between the Soviet
Union's more than 100 nationalities.
   Officials have pledged a cultural and economic development plan
for Nagorno-Karabakh, apparently instead of meeting the Armenian
demand to annex the territorty.
   The newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura said today the plan would cost
up to $640 million.
   ``These millions, which are so necessary now for restructuring,
the country is giving to Karabakh,'' it said in a front-page
article tracing the unrest to poor social and economic conditions.
   Sovietskaya Kultura backed the Soviet leadership's plan to
improve conditions, even though Armenian activists have said
specifically that improvement of education, cultural facilities and
economic conditions will not solve the problem.
   The newspaper said there is almost a complete absence of
schoolbooks in the Armenian language, no teaching of Armenian
history and that residents of Nagorno-Karabakh could not receive
Armenian television.
   It said each resident of the area would have a separate
apartment or home by the year 2,000 and that the government would
build two reservoirs to improve the water supply to Stepanakert.

   A bomb planted in a jeep killed at
least four Soviets in Kabul, and an Afghan Politburo member
narrowly escaped assassination when a bomb blew up a bridge,
Western diplomatic sources said today.
   The Politburo member was wounded and two of his bodyguards died,
the diplomats said.
   The violence in the Afghan capital coincided with reports of
clashes in northern and eastern Afghanistan between Soviet-backed
government forces and anti-communist Moslem guerrillas, the
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Moscow, a Soviet spokesman denied that Soviets had been
killed in the attack Sunday.
   ``This is not true. Nothing of this kind has happened,'' said
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov. The spokesman said
he had talked with the Soviet ambassador in Kabul.
   Diplomats said the bomb blew up a jeep and killed at least four
Soviets. It also gutted a shop, blew over a tree and hurled debris
several hundred yards. The explosion occurred in a shopping
district of the Afghan capital that is frequented mainly by
Soviets, diplomats said.
   Earlier Sunday, two bombs were defused near the central post
office and Ministry of Communications, the diplomats said. Two
other bombs were discovered and defused in mid-March in the
Ministry of the Interior, they said.
   The diplomats said other incidents in the capital indicated a
new flare-up of factionalism between the mainly urban Parcham wing
and the rural Khalq wing of the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.
   The sources said a car bomb exploded March 23 on a bridge
spanning the Kabul river as Khalqi Politburo member Saleh Mohammad
Zeary was driving by, wounding him and killing two bodyguards
riding in a separate car.
   On March 19, national police of the Interior Ministry and secret
police of the State Security Ministry got into a firefight that
killed several Interior police, the diplomats said.
   Both forces are charged with maintaining security in Kabul but
the secret police are aligned with the Parchamis of President
Najib, former intelligence chief, while the national police are
predominantly Khalqi, as is the military.
   Despite the violence in Kabul, the sources said the traditional
battlefield in Paghman, west of the city, has become quiet as
guerrillas apparently have concentrated on resupplying with the
spring thaw.
   The diplomats said it was unclear whether the latest pattern in
fighting reflected expectations of a Soviet troop withdrawal, which
Moscow has said could begin in late spring.
   The Soviets sent troops to Afghanistan in December 1979 to help
the government battle Moslem insurgents. Some 115,000 Soviets
remain.

   Vice President George Bush was likely to
win handily in Connecticut's Republican primary today while Jesse
Jackson hoped to give regional favorite Michael Dukakis a run for
his money in the Democratic contest.
   There are 52 Democratic delegates and 35 Republican delegates at
stake in the Connecticut contest. Voter registrars around the state
reported a surge of last-minute registrations before the noon
Monday deadline.
   But early reports from polling places indicated light turnout.
``It's very, very slow,'' Waterbury deputy Democratic registrar
Gloria Keaveney said. State officials predicted about a third of
the voters would turn out.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, has won all five New
England contests so far.
   A Hartford Courant newspaper poll conducted March 9-20 gave
Dukakis the support of 50 percent of Democrats likely to vote
Tuesday. Jackson had 16 percent and Paul Simon and Albert Gore Jr.
each had 3 percent. Twenty-seven percent were undecided. The poll
of 558 Democrats had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
   Thirman Milner, Jackson's Connecticut chairman, estimated
Jackson would win at least 24 percent and possibly 30 percent.
   Dukakis has the support of Connecticut's top Democrats,
including Gov. William A. O'Neill, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd and
state Chairman John F. Droney.
   Droney, who is nominally supporting Dukakis, said his loss to
Jackson in Michigan made a strong showing _ 50 percent or better _
even more crucial in Connecticut. Dukakis rejected the thesis.
   ``Look _ a victory is a victory,'' Dukakis said at a news
conference.
   Droney said the results today will depend largely on voter
turnout.
   ``If you had all 650,000 Democrats in the state vote ... then I
think Dukakis would have 50 or 60 percent of the vote,'' Droney
said. ``But only 33 or 35 percent of them are going to vote and of
that ... a third of them are going to be Jackson people.''
   Bush grew up in Connecticut and still retains strong links here.
He was the son of a popular U.S. senator from the state and his
mother and brother still live in Greenwich.
   Bush beat Ronald Reagan in Conecticut's 1980 primary.
   The newspaper poll showed Bush with the support of 64 percent of
the 432 likely GOP voters Tuesday, while Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas
had 20 percent and Pat Robertson had 2 percent. The remaining 14
percent were undecided. The poll of Republicans had a margin of
error of 6 percent.
   Bush has the support of virtually all the GOP hierarchy in
Connecticut, including its four-member congressional delegation and
state Chairman Robert S. Poliner.
   Voter registrars around the state reported a surge of
last-minute registrations before the Monday noon deadline. In New
Haven, officials said hundreds signed up, while the estimate in
Hartford was 400 and in Bridgeport, 200.
   Voter registration figures provided last week by the secretary
of state's office showed that an estimated 648,000 Democrats and
430,000 Republicans were eligible to vote in today's primary. Party
leaders estimated that turnout would be between 30 percent and 40
percent.

   Soviet and American doctors participating in
an international satellite teleconference differed today on whether
cancer patients should be informed of their medical condition.
   In an exchange between specialists at the National Institutes of
Health near Washington and Soviet specialists at a studio in
Moscow, the Russian doctors said they believed cancer patients
should not be told they have the disease.
   Doctors on the American end of the satellite-linked
teleconference strongly disagreed.
   The Soviets presented an informal survey in which Soviet
citizens repeatedly said they would prefer not to be informed if
they are diagnosed with cancer.
   Dr. Nikaolai P. Napalkov, president of the oncological society
of the USSR, said patients usually are not informed in the Soviet
Union of such a diagnosis because of the widespread belief that
cancer automatically means death.
   ``Only in rare cases when a patient refuses treatment does the
doctor have an obligation to tell the patient'' that he has cancer,
Napalkov said.
   He said generally Soviet doctors believe that ``it is hardly a
good idea to tell the patient directly that he has cancer.''
   Dr. Natalya Peredodchikova, another Soviet cancer specialist,
said that ``unless there is an acute necessity, such as their
refusing treatment, there is no need to tell the patient.''
   But Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National
Cancer Institute, said he feels compelled to tell patients precise
details of their condition in order to maintain a solid
patient-doctor relationship.
   ``The sense of trust that exists between doctor and patient is
very important,'' he said.
   ``It's improbable for me to imagine treating a patient without
that free exchange of information,'' Rosenberg said.
   The television exchange between cancer specialists of the two
countries lasted just over two hours and begand with pre-recorded
remarks from President Reagan and his wife, Nancy.
   Mrs. Reagan, who has undergone surgery for breast cancer, said
that ``cancer is bigger than any one country; it is a problem of
all mankind.''
   The first lady said that she had ``always thought cancer would
strike someone else, another family.''
   Then her husband and she both developed cacers which were
surgically removed.
   ``We have been fortunate recipients of advanced medical
science,'' she said.
   Reagan struck the same theme in his brief remarks, telling the
doctors of both countries, ``we are depending on all of you in your
combined wisdom to win the battle over this disease and, in doing
so, to improve the length and quality of human life for all
mankind.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, in a statement read during the
telecast, said cancer is an enemy that is striking humans in
countries everywhere.
   Though there has been progress, he said, ``the enemy is far from
routed, he is not retreating and is threatening everybody, and the
fight calls for vigorous and concerted action.''
   A spokeswoman at NCI said the cancer researchers wanted to
exchange ideas on treatment, diagnostic techniques and methods of
prevention.
   Organizers arranged for the conference to be broadcast to about
1,500 U.S. hospitals and health care facilities on the Hospital
Satellite Network. The U.S. Information Agency also arranged to
carry the conference on its WORLDNET system to 57 cities in Europe,
Africa and the Middle East. In the Soviet Union, an edited version
of the conference will be broadcast to an estimated 150 million
people.

   A ban on state-funded abortions for poor
women has been put off at least until voters decide the issue this
fall.
   The ban had been scheduled to take effect Wednesday, but
Attorney General Frank Kelley on Monday postponed it until after
the Nov. 8 election.
   ``We simply have to accept his decision. We would like to
emphasize that the law was a duly enacted law, passed by
overwhelming majorities in both houses of the Legislature, and we
felt very strongly that it should go into effect,'' said Barbara
Listing, president of Right To Life of Michigan.
   Kelley said the law should be delayed because pro-choice forces
apparently gathered enough signatures to put the issue on the fall
ballot. Under the state constitution, getting a law put to a vote
suspends it.
   The signatures aren't expected to be certified until next month,
but Kelley said because the petitions appear to meet legal
requirements, the signatures must be presumed valid.
   His opinion carries the weight of law, unless overturned by a
circuit court.
   ``We have to be pleased that there will be no cutoff and that
health care for poor women will continue and we're pleased that
their health is going to be protected at least until November, when
voters go to the polls and settle this issue,'' said Judith Frey, a
spokeswoman for the People's Campaign for Choice.
   The measure easily passed the Legislature last year, and because
it had been initiated by a petition drive, it escaped the
gubernatorial veto that has scuttled 17 previous efforts to cut off
the funding.
   After the law was passed, anti-abortion forces contended it
should take effect immediately, but pro-choice groups sued, and the
courts ruled that it would take effect 90 days after the end of the
1987 legislative session.
   Meanwhile, the pro-choice forces started their own petition
drive, leading to the delay until voters decide the issue.
   Michigan is one of 14 states that uses taxpayer money to finance
abortions for the poor. In 1986, the most recent year for which a
final tally is available, Michigan paid $5.8 million for 18,600
abortions.

<TEXT>
   The King County Council has approved an ordinance
requiring sex offenders give up blood samples, which will provide a
``genetic fingerprint.''
   Under the law, which was passed Monday and takes effect Oct. 1,
people convicted of sex offenses will be required to surrender a
blood sample. Police will build a genetic library for future
investigations.
   ``It will be a huge step forward in our ability to apprehend and
prosecute rapists,'' said King County Councilman Ron Sims, one of
eight council members taking part in the unanimous vote.
   A spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union endorsed
parts of the law but urged the council to delay final action.
   ``This would be the first in the nation, and we therefore are
responsible to be sure all issues are understood and agreed to.
Take time to analyze. Don't be hasty,'' Jerry Sheehan said.
   But the King County prosecutor's office urged the council not to
be intimidated by being first.
   ``The fact that we may be the first jurisdiction (to adopt the
genetic fingerprinting legislation) gives us a sense of
responsibility, but we should not shy away from its extreme
value,'' said Jeffrey Baird, a deputy prosecutor.
   Baird said identifying offenders is often the most difficult
part of prosecuting rape cases. ``This evidence will help resolve
the question of identity,'' he said.
   The ordinance established a technical committee to guarantee the
accuracy and reliability of the genetic process. A separate
committee will study how to store and retrieve genetic data.

   Americans who pay at least $100 can have the names of their

   Another department source, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that neither Burns nor Weld acted in the belief
that Meese is about to be indicted.
   However, said the source, both men are concerned because the
Justice Department's image continues to be damaged due to the
ongoing criminal investigation of Meese, the nation's top law
enforcement officer.
   Terry Eastland, a Justice Department spokesman, pointed out that
it is not unusual for political appointees to leave government in
the last year of an administration.
   Eastland said that Burns, Weld and Stephen S. Trott, the
associate attorney general who was confirmed as a federal judge
last week, were sworn into their jobs in 1986 and that ``this is
1988; this happens to be a year when people are leaving and they
all happen to be leaving at the same time.''
   The department has not replaced Trott.
   A White House official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, confirmed that Reagan had received the letters, but
that he had not yet composed a response.
   The official said there was ``no reason given'' in the letters
for the resignations.
   ``The president accepts the resignations with regret and good
wishes for the future,'' the official said. ``They served with
distinction.''

   An African National Congress official who recently
told authorities she had received death threats and was being
followed was shot and killed today while entering her office.
   The body of Dulcie September, 45, was found in her northeast
Paris apartment building, which also served as an office for the
group.
   Mrs. September had represented the ANC in France, Switzerland
and Luxembourg since 1984. The anti-apartheid group is outlawed in
South Africa.
   An ANC colleague said Mrs. September recently told Interior
Ministry officials that she had received threats and was being
followed.
   No group or individual immediately claimed responsibility for
the attack, but ANC officials blamed South Africa. South Africa
denied involvement.
   The French news agency Agence-France Press reported Mrs.
September was shot in the face while entering her office about 9
a.m. Her body was found surrounded by shells from a .22-caliber
rifle.
   She was holding letters in her hand and a key was in the door of
the fourth-floor office, AFP reported. Sources at the scene said
her attacker apparently was waiting when she arrived to begin her
normal working day.
   Maurice Cukierman, an ANC treasurer in the office, said Mrs.
September had ``informed the Ministry of the Interior that she had
received threats and that she had been followed during the last few
days.''
   ``It is with anger that I learned of her assassination,
especially since we had advised French authorities that South
Africa was ready to commit assassinations in Europe,'' he said.
   Eddy Amkongo, representative in France for the Southwest African
Peoples Organization, told reporters at the scene of the killing
that he had also been threatened and had requested protection from
the French government.
   ``But until today we have received no response,'' he said.
   The Interior Ministry declined to confirm or deny whether it had
received requests for protection from the African groups.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
assassination looked like ``the work of a professional.''
   At ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, spokesman Tom Sebina
called the killing ``part of a deliberate South African campaign to
assassinate ANC members and ANC leaders.''
   Without citing any evidence, Sebina linked Mrs. September's
killing to a recent series of attacks carried out by the South
African military against what the South African army called ANC
``terrorists.''
   Since Friday the South African army has killed 11 people in
raids in Botswana, near the Botswana border with South Africa and
in the black homeland of Venda.
   Sebina said he did not know whether any of the 11 people killed
in the raids were affiliated with the ANC.
   South African Foreign Minister Roloef Pik Botha suggested the
death may have been the result of an internal quarrel within the
ANC.
   Pretoria ``cannot be held responsible for this death,'' the
foreign minister said in a statement issued through the South
African Embassy. ``While details concerning the assassination are
not yet known, the (South African) government must stress that
serious quarrels exist within organizations which use violence to
attain their political objectives.''
   The ANC, the main black guerrilla group fighting to overthrow
the South Africa government, maintains a worldwide network of about
20 ``information offices,'' including several in Europe, to lobby
for support and receive aid.
   The ANC was banned by South Africa in 1960 for its
anti-apartheid activities. Since then, it has waged a bombing a
sabotage campaign to wrest control from the government in Pretoria.
   The Soviet Union is the ANC's chief military supplier. ANC
leader Nelson Mandela has been jailed in South Africa since 1962.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   The Senate met today in an unusual closed-door
session called by conservatives who say the Soviets are lying about
their nuclear forces, but supporters of the U.S.-Soviet arms treaty
said the charges already have been refuted.
   ``We're going to examine the evidence that there are over 1,000
SS-20s, that the CIA has attempted to cook the books on the issue,
and that the Soviets have deliberately falsified their data,'' said
Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, one of the chief critics of the treaty
banning medium-range missiles.
   But Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, vice-chairman of the
Intelligence Committee, said the charges are ``the same old stuff''
which has been considered and rejected by the panel as it endorsed
the treaty last week.
   The Soviets have declared that they have 650 SS-20s and all
those missiles will have to be destroyed when the pact takes effect.
   But Symms and other critics say the Soviets have up to 350
SS-20s more han they have declared, and the critics have said U.S.
intelligence estimates of the higher numbers have been hidden.
   ``In the opinion of this seantor, the CIA has cooked the numbers
of SS-20s and I'm prepared to prove it,'' said Sen. Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo., another critic of the pact.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a supporter of the treaty, said,
``these arguments have been heard and rejected. I don't expect to
hear anything I don't know.''
   The Old Senate Chamber where the meeting was held has only
rarely been used for business meetings since the Senate moved to
its present quarters in 1859. It was used this time because the
regular Senate chamber is laced with modern broadcasting and
electric cable that could make eavesdropping possible.
   It is the first secret Senate meeting since Oct. 7, 1986, and
one of six in the past six years.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said today that the
closed-door meeting was sought by conservatives and he noted that
Senate rules permit such a session at the request of any two
senators.
   Supporters of the U.S.-Soviet treaty say the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee is likely to approve it by a margin similar to
the 18-2 endorsement given Monday by the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   The Foreign Relations panel is scheduled to vote Wednesday on
whether to send the pact to the floor of the full Senate, where
approval is expected next month.
   When the Foreign Relations Committee finally votes, ``I expect
the treaty will be endorsed by a substantial majority,'' said Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the panel.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a chief treaty supporter among panel
Republicans, agreed with Pell. ``There is strong bipartisan
support,'' Lugar said.
   The only opposition votes in the closed-door Armed Services
meeting Monday were cast by Sens. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., and
Symms, according to senators who were present.
   However, Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said there are
still a number of questions which should be answered about the
treaty.
   Nunn told the Foreign Relations Committee that during his
panel's hearings, ``serious concerns were raised that the treaty
was unclear on futuristic systems'' and whether they would be
banned by the pact.
   Examples of those systems could include laser weapons, particle
beam weapons or other advanced technologies, he said.
   Byrd said today that when the treaty reaches the floor, he won't
seek a vote until the issue is resolved. ``I think that's a very
important matter that's going to have to be settled,'' he said.
   The treaty bans ``weapons delivery vehicles'' with a range of
400 to 3,400 miles, Nunn noted, but ``there was disagreement on
what that meant.''
   There has not been any final word from the Reagan administration
on how the United States is defining the term and the Armed
Services Committee thinks it is ``critical'' that the question be
answered, Nunn said. The White House has been asked for a report
providing that answer, he said.
   ``The Senate must be very clear in defining which type of
futuristic weapons will be allowed and which will not,'' Nunn said.
   Sen. Daniel Quayle, R-Ind., a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said the panel thought it was easier to define what
weapons or technologies are covered now, instead of waiting until
the next decade.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on the Armed
Services panel, said he thought the questions can be answered
within two or three days.

<HEAD>Elderly Catholic Priest Released From Prison</HEAD>

   An elderly Chinese Catholic priest, who spent
much of the last 30 years behind bars for refusing to cut his links
with the Vatican, has been released on parole, the Shanghai
Catholic Association said today.
   An official of the state-sanctioned assocation, who declined to
be identified, said Vincent Chu, also known as Zhu Hongshen, was
paroled Feb. 6 so he could obtain better medical attention. He said
Chu, believed to be about 72, was generally in good health.
   The Jesuit priest was first jailed in 1955 along with Shanghai
Bishop Ignatius Kung (Gong Pinmei), who was convicted of treason
and sentenced to life in prison.
   Kung, now 87, was released in 1985. A Shanghai court earlier
this year ended his parole and restored his political rights.
   Chu was released from prison in 1979 and reportedly resumed his
contacts with priests who secretly remained loyal to the Vatican.
   Chu and three other elderly Jesuit priests were detained in 1981
and charged two years later with colluding with foreign countries
and endangering the sovereignty of the state among other crimes.
   Chu was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The other three
received sentences ranging from 2{ years to 10 years. The Shanghai
church official declined comment on the situation of the other
three.
   China severed relations with the Vatican in 1957 and set up the
Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church as the only recognized
organization for Chinese Catholics.
   The church claims more than 3 million members. An unknown number
of Catholics remain secretly loyal to the pope, and several still
are being held in prison for their religious practices.

   An Indian judicial candidate was slain by
a youth who blamed him for a romantic problem, not for political
reasons, authorities said today. One suspect was jailed, the other
committed suicide, they said.
   Julian Pierce, a 42-year-old Lumbee Indian who was running
against the Robeson County district attorney for Superior Court
judge, was gunned down Saturday at his home. It had been speculated
that the killing was the work of someone who objected to an Indian
being a judge in the racially tense county.
   Robeson County Sheriff Hubert Stone said Sandy Gordon Chavis,
24, a Lumbee Indian, was arrested this morning on a murder warrant.
Chavis was being held at the Robeson County Jail.
   The dead man was identified as John Anderson Goins, 24, also an
Indian, whose body was found this morning at his father's home.
Both men were from Pembroke
   ``I think it shows the people that nothing else is involved,''
Stone said at a news conference this morning. ``I think the people
of Robeson County will understand that it's just another murder. I
think the tension will drop now that we've made an arrest.''
   ``I can assure the world that there was no political involvement
in the case,'' he said.
   Pierce, divorced since December 1983, was dating a woman whose
daughter had been involved with Goins and the man blamed him for
difficulties with the girl, Stone said.
   ``They (the young couple) started having problems and they broke
up,'' Stone said. ``Two warrants were issued last week by the
girlfriend's mother, charging Goins with trespassing. Goins felt
Pierce had something to do with it. He got mad and he killed him.''
   The sheriff said Chavis signed a confession that Goins, who had
worked as a security guard in Raleigh, was the triggerman in the
slaying.
   Goins' body was found in a closet at his father's home. He had
gone to the house after eluding police who tried to arrest him.
Goins died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, said
Stone. His father was not home at the time.
   Neither Goins nor Chavis had prior criminal records, other than
minor traffic violations.
   The murder weapon was a 12-gauge, pump shotgun, said Stone. The
killers came to Pierce's home, broke a window pane in the back door
and shot him once in the chest and again in the side as he turned,
Stone said. They then entered the house and shot him a third time.
   Later, Goins went to the home of Ruth Locklear, Pierce's
girlfriend and the mother of 16-year-old Shannon Bullard, and
talked with her.
   ``He didn't tell her he had killed Mr. Pierce,'' Stone said.
   Commissioners in the troubled county had urged the appointment
of a special prosecutor to investigate the killing because of fears
it was racially linked.
   In addition, Pierce's supporters said they would try to change a
state law that would automatically make District Attorney Joe
Freeman Britt the winner in the May 3 Democratic primary.
   The county of about 100,000 people in southeast North Carolina
is 37 percent Indian, 37 percent white and 26 percent black. The
Lumbee Indians, who are native to the region, are not a federally
recognized tribe.
   Anger at what the Indians call corrupt local government and
entrenched racism boiled over Feb. 1, when two Lumbees took
hostages at The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton, the county seat.
   County commissioners on Monday adopted a resolution asking Britt
to ask the state attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor.
   Pierce's campaign manager, Harvey Godwin, also said the
25-member Committee to Elect Julian Pierce decided Sunday to ask
Gov. Jim Martin to call a special session of the Legislature to
delay the primary and extend the filing period to allow another
minority candidate to run.
   State law says if a candidate dies 30 days or more after the
filing period closes, the opposing candidate is declared the
winner. The filing period for the judicial race ended Feb. 1.
   Under the law, Britt would be declared the winner. Since there
is no Republican candidate in the county, winning the primary is
tantamount to winning the judgeship.
   Governor's spokesman Jim Sughrue said Martin would meet Thursday
with Pierce's supporters. He said Martin would not make a decision
before consulting with other state leaders.
   About 15 black and Indian attorneys from the area met behind
closed doors Monday to select a candidate to take Pierce's place.
After the meeting, Godwin said one to four attorneys were being
considered.
   Stone said he felt better about the investigation than he did
Saturday because of the way people were responding to his plea for
help and because no violence had erupted.
   ``No one's interested in any more violence,'' the sheriff said.
   Ray Littleturtle, a Lumbee activist, said he urged fellow
Indians to stay calm.
   However, he said many were frustrated that Pierce's death had
hurt their chances of achieving change from within the system.
   ``This happens in Third World countries, not the United States,
political candidates getting assassinated,'' Littleturtle said.

   Surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould testified today that Baby M has a right to see her
and would benefit from spending time with her and her family.
   ``It's her right more so than anybody's right for her to see
me,'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould told Superior Court Judge Birger M.
Sween on the second day of a hearing to determine how much time she
can spend with the child she bore under a $10,000 contract but then
refused to give up.
   Speaking calmly, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 30, asked for immediate
visits at her home and eventual overnight stays with expansion of
her time with the child, now 2, to include half the summer and some
holidays. Mother and child now visit once a week for two hours,
supervised at a social services center.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said she has much to offer the child, now
legally Melissa Stern. She said the child could benefit by the
support of Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's family, including her husband,
accountant Dean Gould, and her children by a previous marriage,
Ryan, 13, and Tuesday, 12.
   She said the visitation schedule initially must be carefully
spelled out by the court to make it easier for both sides in the
bitter dispute to get along.
   On Monday, the child's father, William Stern, 42, in bitter
testimony that ended in tears, said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould is
untrustworthy and could undermine the child's relationship with him
and his wife.
   In the final legal phase of the Baby M case, Stern asked the
judge to halt visitation for several years, perhaps until her 10th
birthday, saying contact with Mrs. Whitehead-Gould could
emotionally harm the child.
   ``I'm afraid that she will never let Melissa be her own
person,'' he said in 2{ hours of testimony. ``Mary Beth is a liar.
... I can't trust her.''
   In later testimony, Stern's wife, Elizabeth, said she and Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould were ``poles apart.''
   ``I don't have any respect for her. ... I'd never choose her as
my friend. And quite simply, too much has gone on,'' Mrs. Stern
said.
   Stern said he feared Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who lost a highly
publicized custody battle, would exploit Melissa to promote her
book about the case.
   The hearing was ordered by the New Jersey Supreme Court in its
landmark Feb. 3 decision that declared surrogacy-for-pay illegal
and restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's parental rights, but awarded
Sterns custody.
   The Sterns paid Mrs. Whitehead-Gould $10,000 to bear them a
child because they feared 42-year-old Mrs. Stern, who suffers a
mild form of multiple sclerosis, would suffer complications during
pregnancy. Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was artificially inseminated with
Stern's sperm.
   Under cross-examination, the Sterns acknowledged that Melissa
does not seem to have been harmed by her contact with Mrs.
Whitehead-Gould.
   When the judge asked him what kind of religion Melissa would be
exposed to, Stern, who is Jewish and whose relatives other than his
parents all died in the Holocaust, wept. After composing himself,
he said he expects to expose her to the Unitarian Church. Mrs.
Stern is not Jewish.

   D.J. Smith feels he's been placed in
double jeopardy because the TV game show ``Jeopardy'' won't pay him
the $5,000 he won and has banned him from the program.
   The problem was that when Smith appeared on ``Jeopardy,'' less
than a year had passed since he had played ``Wheel of Fortune.''
Game show rules enacted after a 1958 scandal prohibit contestants
from appearing on game shows more than once a year.
   Smith won $1,200 on ``Wheel of Fortune'' on Thanksgiving Day,
and was disqualified from $5,000 in ``Jeopardy'' winnings.
   ``I feel like I'm in double jeopardy,'' said Smith, 55, a
business analyst. ``They won't give me my money, and they won't let
me be on the show again.''
   A representative for ``Jeopardy,'' produced by Merv Griffin
Enterprises and broadcast on ABC affiliates, invited Smith to Los
Angeles in January to play in a seniors ``Jeopardy'' tournament.
   Smith said he told the representative: ``That's great! I was
just on the `Wheel of Fortune' a little while ago.''
   But no one apparently caught the remark.
   Smith said he mentioned his earlier appearance again when he
filled out a registration form for ``Jeopardy.''
   Prizes in the seniors tournament were awarded according to how
many rounds each contestant survived. Smith said he compiled enough
points for a berth in a semifinal contest and an automatic prize of
$5,000.
   But the next day, he said, he was told his appearance on
``Wheel'' disqualified him.
   ``We didn't enjoy having to do that,'' said George Vosburgh,
``Jeopardy'' producer. ``Even though the network stressed (the
rules), it got by him and it got by us.''
   Game show officials withheld the $5,000 prize, awarding him the
$1,000 quarterfinalist prize instead.
   The networks established the one-year waiting period for game
shows in the aftermath of a 1958 scandal in which answers to ``The
$64,000 Question'' were given to contestants before the show.

   Jesse Jackson's surge in the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination has gained attention in South Africa and
Britain. Here are some of the comments of newspapers in those
countries:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Business Day of Johannesburg (pro-business): ``It has ... been
a widespread belief that the U.S. is `not ready' for a black
president. The support Michigan gave Jackson on Saturday raises the
intriguing possibility that this may not be true.
   ``It is more than 30 years since Brown vs. Board of Education
ended segregation in American schools, and racial causes have
steadily declined in influence. Could it be that many young
Americans, nurtured in an environment of equal rights, have
outgrown racial prejudice?
   `` ... Jackson probably won't become president this year, but he
could be the man who opens the way to the White House for a black
American.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Daily Telegraph of London (conservative): ``Mr. Jackson
still stands very little chance of securing the nomination: he is
widely perceived as unelectable in November not because he is black
_ America may be ready for that _ but becauppeal even to white hardhats
in industrial Michigan is to strengthen his claim to the vice
presidential spot on the Dukakis ticket, or at the very least to a
say in pulling Mr. Dukakis's platform to the left.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (conservative-independent): ``Mr. Jackson
is not unelectable because blacks vote for him. ... He is
unelectable because of the kind of whites who vote for him. The
entrails from Michigan show him with disproportionate support from
the sort of voters _ such as those in the state's numerous
university towns _ who were for Mr. McGovern in 1972. He was
unelectable, and white.
   ``Sooner or later, a black presidential candidate will emerge in
the United States who will campaign, not as a black _ emphasizing
links with races and idealogues abroad who have nothing in common
with American blacks either in outlook or standard of living _ but
as a traditional Democrat or Republican.''

   A man who said he locked his
79-year-old grandmother in her room without food or medication
because she wanted to die has been charged with manslaughter in her
death, a sheriff's spokesman said.
   Alberta M. Bandell probably died between three and four weeks
ago, Pasco County sheriff's spokesman Bob Loeffler said Monday. Her
decomposed body was found Monday morning after her grandson,
Richard William Jones, 45, called the sheriff's office.
   ``He said he couldn't take it anymore, although we're not sure
what he meant by it,'' said Loeffler. ``We went over and saw a
grisly, grisly scene.'' Authorities discovered that the woman's
dog, which also had been shut in the room and deprived of food, had
chewed on the legs of the body, Loeffler said. The dog survived the
ordeal but was taken Monday by county animal health control
authorities and was expected to be put to sleep, Loeffler said.
   Jones was being held on $30,000 bail today.
   Neighbors in this small town 20 miles northeast of Tampa said
they smelled something foul emanating from the mobile home, where
Jones continued to live, for weeks.
   ``Over a month ago, I said, `God, there's a terrible stink out
there,''' David L. Sexton said.
   Neighbors said Jones had told them his grandmother was visiting
friends in Orlando and West Palm Beach.
   According to the arrest affidavit, Jones cashed his
grandmother's personal checks and attempted to sell the mobile home
to a neighbor for $16,500.
   In addition to the cashed checks and the deception of his
neighbors, detectives said they questioned Jones' story of a mercy
killing because of Mrs. Bandell's fairly good health and reports of
frequent arguements between Jones and his grandmother.
   ``He'd lock her in her bedroom different times. He'd curse and
yell at her,'' Sexton said.
   The cause of death was not known yet, but Loeffler said the
woman was a diabetic and required insulin injections.
   Depending on the results of the autopsy, the charge could be
changed to murder, Loeffler said.

   A fire was discovered today in the
arsenal of the Puerto Rico National Guard and police said it might
have been triggered by an explosive device.
   ``Everything indicates there was a criminal hand,'' Police
Superintendent Carlos Lopez Feliciano said in a statement. ``We are
investigating if there was an explosive or incendiary device. It's
not conclusive.''
   No other details on the cause of the blaze were available.
   The fire was discovered by an arsenal guard about 2 a.m. when
smoke was seen coming out of the second-floor storage room, the
superintendent said.
   ``When he checked, he saw two people in the interior parking
area who jumped the fence protecting the perimeter of the
arsenal,'' Lopez Feliciano said.
   All National Guard facilities were under police surveillance
today in case the fire was part of a coordinated attack, Lopez
Feliciano said.
   ``We are guarding all the National Guard installations in case
its part of a series,'' the superintendent said.
   Local explosives experts and officials from the FBI were at the
scene gathering evidence.
   Early this moring several fire engines were at the scene
extinguishing the fire. There was no estimate of damages to the
facility.
   About 600 members of the Puerto Rico National guard flew to the
Panama Canal Zone this weekend for a training exercise. The move
has been criticized by groups favoring Puerto Rico's independence
from the United States, as well as by individual members of the
pro-statehood New Progressive Party and the governing Popular
Democratic Party.
   On Monday, National Guard Adjutant Gen. Alfredo Mora denied the
guardsmen were being sent to Panama for anything other than
training purposes and said the possibility that the guards will see
any combat ``is very remote.''
   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens with most of the rights of
Americans, except that they cannot vote for the president of the
United States.

<HEAD>FBI Investigating Slaying Of Navy Airman

<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating the slaying
of a 22-year-old Navy airman whose decomposed body was identified
10 days after she disappeared from her home.
   FBI agents and other law enforcement officials met Monday at the
Duval County medical examiner's office to discuss the case, said
Atlantic Beach Police Chief David Thompson. He would give no
further details.
   ``We don't want to release anything that could come back to
haunt us,'' he told The Florida Times-Union and Journal.
   Detective Dave Archer said police were certain Anita Lukander
was murdered, but he declined to reveal how she was killed.
   The victim was married May 9, 1987, to a naval petty officer who
flew home from active duty aboard a frigate after being notified of
his wife's disappearance.
   Using dental records, authorties on Sunday identified a body
found the day before along the Intracoastal Waterway in
Jacksonville Beach as that of Mrs. Lukander. The woman had been
missing since March 17.
   Archer said Dr. Peter Lipkovic, medical examiner for Duval, told
police the body had been in the water about eight or nine days.
   Cmdr. Richard O'Neal said Mrs. Lukander was a member of the
Mayport-based Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 42. Her
husband Petty Officer 2nd Class Bill Lukander, also is a member of
the squadron.
   Mrs. Lukander was assigned to shore duty as an administrative
clerk in maintenance control, while her husband is an electronics
technician who often is at sea for the squadron.
   Mrs. Lukander disappeared two days after a Navy paymaster, Lt.
Ratish Prasad, 24, was slain March 15 aboard the USS Hancock in
Mayport. Prasad was shot in the head at close range.
   Navy investigators said $94,629 was stolen from the ship's safe.
No arrests have been made in that case.
   Navy spokesmen said earlier there appeared to be no connection
between the cases, noting that the ship and the helicopter squadron
are in widely separate areas on the huge base.

   A military court today sentenced two soldiers
accused of burying four Arabs alive to longer prison sentences than
requested by prosecutors, saying their conduct was grave and
shameful, Israel radio reported.
   The court sentenced Pvt. Dror Segen-Cohen to six months in jail
along with a four-month suspended sentence. Pvt. Yair Nissimi was
given five months in jail and a seven-month suspended sentence.
   The prosecution had asked for two months in jail for Segen-Cohen
and 2{ months for Nissimi.
   The soldiers admitted they beat four Arabs from the occupied
West Bank village of Kfar Salem on Feb. 5 after a protest in the
village. The soldiers also admitted burying the four Arabs in about
25 inches of mud.
   The Arabs survived.
   The court ruled the soldiers' behavior had tarnished the army's
image and put Israel in a bad light.
   A third soldier, Sgt. Maj. Charlie Danino, is accused of
ordering the burial. He has pleaded innocent and his trial is still
underway.
   Five other soldiers are also on trial for violating military
orders. One has been charged in the killing of a Palestinian in the
Gaza Strip and four others for beating two Palestinian detainees
after a demonstration in Nablus.
   According to U.N. figures, 119 Palestinians have been killed in
the occupied territories since anti-Israeli protests began Dec. 8.
One Israeli soldier has died.

   The chairman of the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee says he would not allow a proposed amendment to
jeopardize passage of a new cabinet-level Department of Veterans
Affairs.
   The statement Monday by panel Chairman John Glenn, D-Ohio,
improved prosects for the legislation, which passed the House last
November after President Reagan announced his support for a
Cabinet-level department.
   The proposed amendment would allow veterans to appeal any denied
claim to federal courts.
   Glenn said he supported judicial review, but would not attempt
to add the provision in his committee. Judicial review, he said,
was in the jurisdiction of the Veterans Affairs Committee, which
has tentatively scheduled a hearing on the issue for April 21.
   The Ohio Democrat said he believes veterans are treated as
second class citizens, because they do not have the same appellate
rights as those receiving unfavorable rulings from other agencies.
   The Government Affairs Committee reported that old-line veterans
groups lobbied against judicial review, while groups of Vietnam and
paralyzed veterans said they favor the provision. The committee
said mail was split about 50-50.

   Forestry workers killed a Bengal tiger
after it attacked and killed a woodcutter, who was believed to be
its 17th human victim in five months, police said Tuesday.
   The attack occurred in the Sundarbans Forest, a national tiger
preserve 80 miles southwest of Dhaka.
   Authorities believe the tiger had killed at least 16 other
people. The attacks had spread fear among nearby villagers and
forestry officials, who shot the animal Monday.
   Tigers generally are shy animals and rarely attack humans unless
they are injured, threatened or facing food shortages. They are
protected by law with poaching punishable by up to five years in
jail.

<TEXT>
   The Nobel Foundation, after
record-breaking profits, is raising the amount of the annual Nobel
Prizes by 15 percent to $428,000, the head of the foundation said
Tuesday.
   Executive Director Stig Ramel said the foundation established by
Alfred Nobel's 1896 testament saw its profits rise by 29 percent,
yielding $5.6 million to finance the five prizes and the
arrangements for awarding them.
   Last year's prize was worth $362,000, up 8 percent from 1986.
   The foundation administers the endowment which finances the
Nobel prizes in literature, physics, chemistry and medicine. The
Riksbank, the central bank, created and funded the Nobel Memorial
prize for economics in 1968.
   The laureates are chosen independently by the Swedish Academy of
Sciences, the Academy of Arts and Letters and the Karolinska
Institute. The Nobel committee of the Norwegian parliament awards
the prestigious Peace Prize.
   The prize money is awarded in the currency of the winner's
choice according to the exchange rate on Dec. 10, the day of the
annual award ceremony. The prize is divided if there is more than
one laureate in a category. Last year nine winners shared the six
prizes.
   Ramel told The Associated Press the jump in the value of assets
was largely due to floating the foundation's real estate company on
the Stockholm stock exchange last year.
   Ramel said the foundation's capital this year ``for the first
time is substantially worth more'' than when the prizes were
created after Nobel's death. The first prizes were awarded in 1901.
   Nobel, who invented dynamite, bequeathed the equivalent of about
$150 million in his will to those who ``have conferred the greatest
benefit on mankind.''
   But Nobel stipulated the capital be invested in what he
considered safe fixed-income bonds, which later proved
unprofitable. For 50 years the foundation lost money and the prize
progressively shrank.
   ``The foundation lost about two-thirds of the capital,'' he said.
   Since 1953 the regulations surrounding the Nobel capital has
gradually loosened, enabling the foundation to be more active in
the Swedish economy.
   ``That is why we started the real estate company last year,''
Ramel said. ``Fortunately we were unharmed by the stock market
crash last October.''

   The army-run radio station has refused to play
a protest song critical of Israeli policy in the occupied
territories, the director of the station said Tuesday.
   ``It attacks Israeli soldiers,'' Col. Nahman Shai said of
``Shooting and Crying,'' written and sung by Israeli rock musician
Si Hyman.
   Ms. Hyman said she wrote the song after hearing about a Feb. 5
incident in which Israeli soldiers beat four Palestinians and
buried them alive under two feet of dirt. They survived the attack,
which occurred after troops dispersed a protest in the occupied
West Bank village of Kfar Salem.
   ``They shoot and cry, burn and laugh. When did they learn to
bury people alive?'' one verse of the song says. ``When did they
forget that our children have also been killed?''
   However, Shai said the song's accusations were unfounded. He
said Israeli soldiers ``are doing their jobs in the best possible
fashion and deserve our appreciation.''
   Israel has faced international criticism for its handling of
Palestinian protests that began in the occupied territories four
months ago.
   State-run Israeli radio has not banned the song, but has not
been playing it, either.

   A month-long citywide amnesty has netted 1,563
weapons, including jackknives, axes, machetes and a stun gun that
can deliver a 45,000-volt electric shock, Scotland Yard said
Tuesday.
   The national police force said the amnesty was intended to
encourage people to hand in knives. However, weapons from
pump-action shotguns to brass knuckles were dumped in special bins
or handed in anonymously at police stations.
   Police Cmdr. Walter Boreham, who supervised the amnesty, said
``these weapons, some of which could have been used to maim or
kill, are now off the streets because their owners have woken up to
the fact that carrying a weapon is dangerous.''
   The amnesty ended March 9.

   Democratic officials from around the country,
some wary of the prospect of Jesse Jackson heading their
presidential ticket, will meet with Jackson on Wednesday to discuss
what one party chairman called ``how to win in November.''
   Florida Democratic chairman Charles Whitehead said a small group
of party officials arranged a meeting with Jackson in Washington.
   Whitehead would not say who called the meeting or what the
specific purpose was, beyond ``how to win in November.''
   Dissent is building within the Democratic Party about efforts to
strengthen Jackson's rivals in the wake of his stunning Michigan
caucus victory.
   Alabama Democratic Chairman John Baker suggested in a letter to
party leaders around the South that they form a group of unpledged
convention delegates who will commit themselves to ``the most
electable'' presidential candidate.
   ``We've got to keep one eye, if not two eyes, on the November
general election. I'm tired of the Democratic Party having a ticket
that can't carry but one or two states,'' said Baker of Montgomery,
Ala.
   Others were dismayed by Baker's effort.
   ``The party can't afford that,'' said Jim Ruvolo, state chairman
in Ohio. ``Jesse Jackson is not where he is by some sleight of
hand. He got there by winning votes.''
   Jackson overwhelmed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis in the
Michigan caucuses on Saturday, winning the industrial state by
nearly 2-to-1. That victory stalled Dukakis' momentum and boosted
talk that Jackson could be the first black to win the party's
presidential nomination.
   Baker denied his effort is aimed at Jackson.
   ``I'm not trying to stop anybody,'' he said. But he insisted
Jackson's views do not fall within the party mainstream.
   ``A white candidate espousing what Rev. Jackson is espousing
wouldn't have a chance at being elected,'' Baker said. ``He's the
most liberal candidate running. I wonder if he were white if he
would have any delegates at all.''
   Baker's move did not get a positive response from John Henry
Anderson, Georgia's party chairman.
   ``I don't want to look at anything as a `Stop Jesse Jackson'
movement. All I want to be looking at is electing a Democrat to the
White House,'' said Anderson, who supports Dukakis.
   And Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk would have
no part of a ``Stop Jackson'' movement.
   ``I can't imagine that if he runs through the process and comes
out on top they could take away from him. I would refuse to be part
of that,'' Kirk said. ``I haven't heard of one starting, and I
wouldn't be a party to it.''
   As the party chief, Kirk promised to back the winner.
   ``We've still got the biggest primaries coming up to settle who
the candidate will be, and I'll support that process and its winner
whoever it is,'' Kirk said.
   The DNC chairman said Jackson has won his victories with a
positive message.
   ``I think he's earned credibility, trust and respect. Perhaps
more than any of the other candidates, he has stayed on the high
road with a unifying message and appeal for those looking for
strong leadership,'' Kirk said. ``The success of his candidate
offers an opportunity, not a problem.''
   Ruvolo of Ohio called Jackson the front-runner in the race and
brushed aside questions about electability.
   ``You win in the fall by getting the votes of the people, not by
justing getting the votes of those in the backrooms,'' he said.
``The professional politicians may worry about electability, but
the results so far show the people are not worrying about it.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, as he left the presidential race on
Monday, agreed, saying: ``I believe Jesse Jackson can be nominated
and I think he can be elected.''
   Ruvolo said that the current discussions about Jackson are
premature. He said the party's nominee could easily be decided by
the primary lineup of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio in late April
and early May.
   ``If one candidate wins all three, he is the nominee,'' Ruvolo
said. If no one candidate does, ``then we'll go to the brokered
process.''

<HEAD>U.S. Ignored or Hid Noriega's Drug Links, Former Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former White House aide said Tuesday that
the Reagan administration either ignored or hid the fact that
Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega was dealing in drugs.
   But Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams disputed that
assertion, saying the government acted legally against Noriega as
soon as it could.
   The former White House official, Norman A. Bailey, told the
House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control that Noriega
and other high-level officials of the Panama Defense Forces had
been engaged in drug trafficking, gun running and money laundering
since the mid-1970s.
   Bailey, an economic consultant who formerly was a special
assistant to the president for national security affairs until Oct.
13, 1983, said Noriega and the Panamanian military have engaged
``in the past in activities which represent and have represented a
clear, unquestionable and obvious multiple threat to the national
security in a narrow sense, and the national interests in a broader
sense, of the United States of America.
   ``It is also a story of how clear and incontrovertible evidence
was at best ignored and at worst hidden and denied by many
different agencies and departments of the government of the United
States in such a way as to provide cover and protection for these
activities while at the same time assuring that they did the
maximum damage to those very interests that the officials involved
were sworn to uphold and defend,'' Bailey said.
   Bailey said the information available to the U.S. government on
Noriega and the Panama Defense Forces was not only a ``smoking gun
but rather a 21-cannon barrage of evidence.''
   But Abrams told the committee there has been uncorroborated
allegations of illegal drug-related activity by Noriega for many
years.
   ``We were not unaware of these,'' he said. ``Until recently,
however, there was no substantiated evidence of his narcotics
involvement.''
   Abrams said, however, that when the Justice Department unveiled
evidence against him, Noriega was indicted by two grand juries in
Florida earlier this year. Since then, the United States has
applied economic and diplomatic pressure to drive Noriega from his
post as head of the Defense Forces.
   Abrams said he has heard about general corruption in Panama
since he came into office in July 1985. ``Not only drugs, but
anything that can be done for money,'' he said.
   In answer to a question by Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y.,
Abrams said he would not be surprised to learn that Noriega was
either a double or triple agent.
   ``Noriega is loyal to no one,'' he said. ``He has dealt with our
intelligence agencies. He has dealt with Cuban intelligence. He has
dealt with everyone. He took what information he could get and
passed it on or sold it.''
   Following the hearing, Abrams told reporters: ``I'm unaware of
any documentation (of drug trafficking) during the past five
years.''
   When asked about Bailey's charges, he replied: ``Why do you
think we're going after Noriega?''

   The Security Council will convene an
urgent meeting Wednesday to discuss the situation in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab diplomats said
today.
   A delegation of Arab foreign ministers and the PLO called on
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar today to schedule the
meeting. They also urged the U.N. chief to send another
fact-finding mission to the occupied territories.
   In the toughest crackdown since Palestinian unrest began nearly
Dec. 8, the Israeli army today enforced a three-day closure of the
occupied lands, barring nearly all journalists, Israeli civilians
and Arab visitors.
   Clovis Maksoud, U.N. ambassador for the Arab League, told
reporters after the delegation met Perez de Cuellar that the
Security Council would convene Wednesday to discuss Israel's
actions in the occupied lands.
   The delegation included Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the political
department of the Palestine Liberation Organization; Ahmed Taleb
Ibrahimi, Algeria's foreign minister; Ibrahim Massoud, minister of
state for foreign affairs of Saudi Arabia; Farouk Al-Shara, the
Syrian foreign minister; and Chedli Klibi, secretary-general of the
League of Arab States.
   The delegation, except for the PLO envoy, left for a meeting at
the State Department in Washington to express Arab views on the
Palestinian demonstrations in the occupied territories, a Middle
East peace conference, U.S. efforts to close the PLO's U.N. Mission
and other issues.
   The Security Council has held several meetings on the Middle
East since the heightened Palestinian unrest began and each time
has condemned Israel's measures to put down the protests.
   ``A meeting is necessary because of Israel's clamp down today,
its banning the press and curfew,'' Maksoud said.
   The delegation also asked the United Nations to send a
second-fact finding mission to the territories. Under
Secretary-General Marrack Goulding recently visited the territories
and submitted a report sharply critical of Israel.
   The secretary-general has called for a U.N.-sponsored Middle
East peace conference, involving all parties to the Middle East
conflict, including the PLO, and the five permanent members of the
Security Council.
   Tunisia on Friday formally requested the Security Council
meeting.

<HEAD>Price Support Loans To Be Extended For A Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Price support loans for some old-crop corn and
sorghum will be extended for a year longer than their normal
maturity dates, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said Tuesday.
   The one-year extensions were approved for 1984-crop corn and
sorghum held in the farmer-owned reserve program, and for 1985 and
1986 corn and sorghum under price support loan, he said. No
extensions will be allowed for 1983 and older corn and sorghum
loans.
   Lyng said the announcement on 1985 and 1986 corn and sorghum
loans reversed a previous decision announced on Jan. 29.
   The change was made ``to alleviate grain movement problems due
to a rail car shortage, grain congestion at some country
elevators'' and other logistical problems, he said.
   But the Agriculture Department will reserve the right to ``call
at any time'' the 1985 and 1986 crop loans, Lyng said. Grain in the
farmer-owned reserve program can remain until prices rise enough to
trigger its release.
   The loans are extended to farmers by the department's Commodity
Credit Corp., which uses the grain as collateral. If prices rise
significantly, farmers usually repay the loans and sell or use the
grain as they choose.
   But farmers have the option of not repaying the loans, in which
case CCC takes over the grain when the loans mature, or come due.
By extending the loans, farmers continue to own the grain and
retain their CCC options.
   Parts of the Jan. 29 order still stand, including the decision
not to extend loans on 1987-crop wheat, feed grains and soybeans.
Also, loans that already had been extended on 1985 and 1986 wheat,
feed grains and soybeans will not be extended further when those
mature.

<TEXT>
   More than 80 percent of Americans favor a
federal program to provide long-term home care for the chronically
ill and disabled, according to a poll released Tuesday.
   The survey by Louis Harris & Associates also found that more
than 70 percent would support paying for the program by increasing
Medicare payroll taxes for people who make more than $45,000 a year.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., released the survey in conjunction
with a hearing on his five-year, $25 billion proposal for long-term
home care. House leaders have promised him a floor vote on the bill
although it has not gone through the usual committee scrutiny.
   Many members have criticized the plan as too expensive to pass
this year. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has said Congress
cannot enact both Pepper's plan and another Medicare expansion
shielding the elderly and disabled against catastrophic health-care
costs.
   Catastrophic-cost bills already have passed both houses and
negotiators are working out differences between the two versions.
   Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Aging and a co-sponsor of Pepper's bill, said
virtually no Medicare or insurance coverage is available to
millions of people with a chronic illness.
   ``We have long believed we were seeing a rising tide of public
support for a federal long-term care program, and the Harris poll
shows us Americans are evne more enthusiastic than we imagined,''
Roybal said in a statement.
   The Harris survey found that Americans of all ages, professions,
party affiliations and income levels supported financing a new
home-care program through an increase in the 1.45 percent Medicare
payroll tax on upper-income workers.
   More than 70 percent of people earning above $50,000 supported
that method of financing although they would bear the brunt of it,
the survey found.
   Of those questioned, 82 percent said they could not afford to
pay for the costs of providing long-term care either at home or in
a nursing home _ including more than 60 percent of those making
above $50,000 a year.
   And nearly 80 percent of those polled said they would prefer
long-term home care to care in a nursing home.
   The Harris survey questioned 1,500 adults across the country in
telephone interviews Feb. 18-23. The margin of error is plus or
minus three percentage points.
   The survey echoes an earlier poll last fall that found Americans
by an overwhelming majority were willing to pay higher taxes to
finance long-term care for the elderly.
   Sixty-eight percent of those questioned in the survey by R.L.
Associates were willing to shoulder $10 to $60 a month more in
taxes to pay for the program.
   That survey was commissioned by Long-Term Care '88, a coalition
of senior citizens groups and other organizations hoping to make
the issue a top priority with presidential candidates.
   On a related matter, a government report released Tuesday said
the number of elderly Americans confined to nursing homes is
remaining stable even though the raw numbers are rising because of
an aging population.
   There were 1.3 million nursing home residents at least 65 years
of age in 1985, up 200,000 from 1977, when the last nursing home
figures were collected.
   The report by the Department of Health and Human Services said
the 1985 nursing home population reflected about 1 percent of
Americans 65-74 years old being confined to institutions and about
22 percent of those 85 years and older. Both percentages were
essentially unchanged from the 1977 survey.

   A court Tuesday freed the leader of an
opposition street theater group serving a two-month jail sentence,
but 18 of his supporters were detained by police outside the
courtroom, activists said.
   Waldemar ``The Major'' Fydrych, 34, who heads the group Orange
Alternative, was arrested March 8 as he handed out flowers and
sanitary napkins to women to mock official observances of
International Women's Day.
   Leading cultural figures, including film director Andrzej Wajda,
had appealed for the release of the writer, who became widely known
for organizing various Orange Alternative ``happenings'' in which
demonstrators dressed up as Santa Claus, secret policemen and
Lenten penitents to poke fun at communist authorities.
   The appeals court in Wroclaw acquitted Fydrych of causing public
unrest after finding that testimony by prosecution witnesses was
inconsistent with that given by the sole witness at Fydrych's March
9 misdemeanor hearing, said spokesman Krzysztof Albin.
   Fydrych was released after the hearing, which his supporters
were barred from attending, said Barbara Labuda, another opposition
activist in the southwestern Polish city.
   Police detained three Orange Alternative supporters who were
carrying models of a major's uniform hanging from a gallows in a
morning demonstration outside the courthouse, Albin said.
   At least 15 more supporters, most of them wearing orange-colored
apparel, were detained by police while they waited for the verdict
in a corridor outside the courtroom, Albin said.
   Albin said one Orange Alternative member, Grzegorz Francuz, was
beaten on the way to the police station.
   Opposition activists in Poland are frequently detained for up to
48 hours on misdemeanor charges.

   Rep. James Howard, D-N.J., who
died last week after suffering a heart attack, was eulogized today
as a productive congressman whose contributions can be seen
throughout the country.
   ``He worked hard and he played hard and he laughed full-tilt,''
said House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who spoke during a Roman
Catholic funeral Mass for Howard.
   ``His candle burned brightly for 60 years and others came and
lighted their candles from him,'' said Wright.
   More than 850 people, including four busloads of congressmen and
their aides, attended the service at St. Catharine's Church here.
   Aides to Howard restricted access to the church because it could
hold about 400 people, and a crowd of about 450 watched from the
street as the casket was brought into the church. Loudspeakers
broadcast the service to those gathered outside.
   Howard, 60, died Friday, a day after suffering a heart attack
while playing golf in a Washington suburb.
   He represented the state's 3rd Congressional District and served
in the House for 22 years. He was the second-most senior member of
New Jersey's congressman behind Rep. Peter Rodino, also a Democrat.
   Acting as pallbearers at today's funeral were Sen. Bill Bradley
and Rep. Robert A. Roe, both D-N.J., Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt,
R-Ark., state Sen. Frank Pallone, D-Monmouth, and Monmouth County
freeholders John Villapiano and John D'Amico.
   Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., also spoke during the service.
   ``Jim was one of the best, most productive congressmen, most
beloved congressmen,'' said Udall, who attributed Howard's success
to his honesty and his enthusiasm.
   ``I never saw anyone with a more infectious manner come to the
House floor. He was everywhere at once,'' said Udall.
   As chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee, Howard largely controlled highway and transportation
projects nationwide.
   ``The handy work and fruits of Jim's labor'' can be seen in
Monmouth County as well as across the nation, Wright said.
   In Washington on Monday, the House and Senate voted unanimously
to name the New Jersey segment of Interstate 195 after Howard.
   Howard's staff says it will continue to provide service to
constituents, although the district will not have a vote in the
House until a successor is elected.
   Gov. Thomas H. Kean must call a special election to replace
Howard and has said he will consider holding it Nov. 8 as part of
the general election.
   Third District voters would be asked to pick someone to finish
the final two months of Howard's term, and cast a second vote to
choose a congressman for a full term beginning in January 1989.

   Officials at a city zoo killed and ate
a popular bear cub because they didn't have room for it in the
park, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The cub, named Molly, was 2 years old and was one of visitors'
favorites at the Skansen Park Zoo when the lack of space last
November forced the zoo to cull the cubs, according to the
newspaper, Expressen.
   The bear was served to the zoo's staff.
   ``Molly was so nice, I didn't take a bite,'' caretaker Tina
Reinhed told the newspaper.
   Because of crowded conditons, the cubs are kept for 18 months
before they are either sold or killed, she said.
   ``First we naturally try to sell them to other zoological
parks,'' Reinhed said. ``Sadly enough, they also have an excess (of
bears).''
   Zoo superintendent Pelle Palm said that while people don't like
to see ``teddy bears'' eaten, ``it's worse to destroy meat in a
world that hungers.''

   The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Honduras
will be completed on Thursday, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Dan Howard said the roughly 3,100 soldiers dispatched
to Honduras on March 17-18 were being removed along with their
equipment on a four-day schedule. The first group was airlifted out
Monday.
   The soldiers were dispatched as a warning to the leftist
Nicaraguan government after Sandinista troops moved into Honduras
in pursuit of U.S.-backed Contra rebels. The American troops never
were sent to the border area where the fighting occurred, but
rather staged military exercises with Honduran military units.
   According to the Pentagon, the last contingent of men from the
7th Light Infantry Division will return to Fort Ord, Calif., around
2 p.m. EST on Wednesday. The last unit from the 82nd Airborne will
return to Fort Bragg, N.C., around 9 a.m. EST on Thursday.
   About 2,000 of the troops were scheduled to depart Honduras on
Tuesday, the Pentagon added.

   The government fired 33 police officers for
drug trafficking, armed robbery, accepting bribes and other crimes
as part of a corruption crackdown, authorities said Tuesday.
   Six officers were dismissed for stealing diamonds in the mining
town of Akwatia near Accra, police said. Ten others had smuggled
marijuana to neighboring Ivory Coast by boat.
   Among the fired officers was a deputy police superintendent, but
there were no details on where he had been posted.
   The announcement by the National Police Council, headed by
Ghanaian leader Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, did not say if the
officers had been arrested.
   Two weeks ago, 19 officers were fired for armed robbery and drug
trafficking in the crackdown aimed at reducing corruption and
improving police efficiency and credibility.

<TEXT>
   A gang of 10-year-olds who began
stealing golf balls two months ago have graduated to terrorizing
members of Boca Raton's Executive Country Club with knives,
officials say.
   They've also allegedly dug up the fourth green.
   ``The women golfers are frightened. The men are angry,'' Mary K.
Werre, manager of the country club, said Monday after calling
police.
   ``They're kids who should know better, but they're very, very
nasty,'' said Ed Lombardi, 77, of Deerfield Beach.
   Country club members describe the children as clean-cut,
well-dressed and about 10 years old.
   Lombardi was playing golf last Sunday when some children stole a
friend's ball.
   ``Out on the golf course, we don't want nor expect anything like
that,'' he said. ``I chased them into the woods, but they have
paths. They can go like deer in there.''
   Two foursomes, who played Saturday, told Ms. Werre that children
had sprung from the trees, swiped golf balls and, brandishing
knives, challenged the golfers to ``come and get them.''
   ``A gang of about five 10-year-olds equipped with shovels dug up
the fourth green,'' Boca Raton Officer William Ehrhardt wrote in
his report. ``In addition, the youths were in possession of knives,
intimidated golfers and stole their balls.''
   Country club officials were reluctant at first to report the
juveniles' high jinks.
   ``Whenever we saw them out there we got in our golf cart and
went after them, but they ran and we haven't been able to catch
them,'' Ms. Werre said.
   That was before the children added knives to their arsenal. Now,
Ms. Werre said, she will call police whenever the children are
spotted.
   Ted Wright of Lake Worth was playing last Sunday when he saw
some children playing with remote-controlled cars in the sand trap.
   ``I told them to get off, we were playing,'' he said.
   As Wright went for one of the cars, the youthful owner said they
were leaving, then cursed him.
   About two weeks ago, the children appeared at night wearing
camouflage fatigues, Ms. Werre said. With their faces blackened,
they crept onto the driving range and lifted some golf balls before
a worker saw them and shooed them away, she said.
   Country club officials can't figure out a motive.
   ``If they're stealing range balls, they really can't do well by
selling them anywhere,'' Ms. Werre said. ``If they're stealing from
off the course, you'd think they'd be selling them here, but that
hasn't happened.''

   Common sense and firefighting basics have
won a Navy Achievement Medal for an 18-year-old Marine.
   Pfc. Neil R. Wadley won the medal for his idea that could make
troops invisible to enemy heat-detecting devices. The award was
presented to Wadley by Gen. A.M. Gray, commandant of the Marine
Corps.
   Wadley, of St. Maries, Idaho, who is stationed at the Quantico
base, suggested that combatants wear a special lightweight shield
that would neutralize the enemy's sensors.
   He said he got the idea from his work fighting forest fires with
the Department of Lands in Idaho before he became a Marine.
Everyone was issued a ``fire shelter,'' a five-pound sheet of
material capable of reflecting severe temperatures, he said.
   Wadley said he wasn't prepared for what happened after he wrote
a letter to the Marine Corps Gazette, outlining his idea for the
poncho-type shield.
   The editor of the Gazette forwarded a copy of the letter to Gen.
Gray, and Gray immediately wrote Wadley a personal letter:
   '' ... I'm really excited by your idea, and am taking the
liberty of initiating immediate measures to ensure that its
possibilities are thoroughly explored. I ... commend your creative
intellect for perceiving an innovative approach to a tough problem.
Your idea certainly merits further research and development...''
   Wadley said modestly, ''I don't think I really deserved the
medal. It would have been enough just to get the letter and to meet
the commandant.''

<TEXT>
   Unlikely green thumbs are sprouting at an
inner-city housing project where a vegetable garden is fast
becoming a model of determination and hope in a depressed area.
   It all started last November when a team of 38 residents of the
Nickerson Gardens housing project decided to turn an ugly, vacant
lot into a haven of leafy foliage and vegetables.
   The garden in the city's South-Central area already has produced
enough carrots, onions, tomatoes, broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower
to supply residents and just about anyone else who cares to sample
the home-grown food.
   Word has spread to transients and gang members alike that the
food is available for the taking, just as long as takers ask first.
   ``It took awhile for it to sink in, but all the kids and the
gang members are letting the garden be,'' said gardener Tauheedah
Karim, 32.
   ``It shows you that if you believe in something and you work at
it, it can be done,'' said Wilma Jean Powns, 46, co-captain of the
gardeners, as she stood among her sprouting cabbages in one of the
garden's 20 boxed plots.
   Ms. Powns and her neighbors got help from the End World Hunger
organization and Budget Rent-a-Car, which have sponsored urban
gardens in other cities. The groups supplied seeds, training and
some supplies, while agriculture advisers from the University of
California trucked in rich soil and fertilizer.
   ``This comes from love. Long as we keep at it, this garden's
going to be here a long, long time,'' Ms. Powns said.
   Neighbors keep a watch from their homes and shoo away
trespassers.
   Even local school kids are getting into the act. A class from
the housing project's Head Start program shows up several times a
week to help the gardeners water, taking turns using a faucet to
fill plastic jugs.
   The jugs are doing double duty, said Ms. Powns. When dogs began
rooting through the plants last winter, she said she put to use an
old trick that her grandmother taught her about vegetable
gardening. She filled the jugs with water and ammonia and left them
out for the scavengers.
   ``We had a few dogs running around sneezing like crazy,`` she
said with a laugh. ``Dogs ain't a problem anymore.''

   When American and Japanese children got
together Tuesday to compare prize-winning inventions, one side
brought most of the frivolous, fanciful toys while the other
displayed no-nonsense solutions to everyday problems.
   But in a reversal of stereotypes, it was the Japanese kids who
brought the marionette and robot on skis, and the Americans who
produced door guards, portable seat belts and diapers with built-in
disposable bags.
   The meeting was arranged by a program to spur creativity among
American students called ``Invent America!'' and the Japan
Institution of Invention and Innovation, which has sponsored
competitions for Japanese schoolchildren since 1941.
   The Japanese students' inventions included the mechanized
marionette of Takakiyo Katami, 11, of Gufu City; a robot that can
slalom back and forth on skis by Yasushi Nishiyama, 15, of Nagoya;
and an illuminated constellation model made from 2,000 optical
fibers by Takahiro Tsurita, 14, of Toyota City.
   Tomoyuki Imura, 15, of Miki City, Japan, came up with a ball
retriever that consists of several tennis cans open at both ends
and taped together.
   Sally Mallison, 12, of Wilmington, Del., who devised her
``Bag-A-Diap'' to help her parents cope with messy diapers on car
trips, said, ``I think from the Japanese I've learned that
inventions can be mechanical and they can also be ... like mine
where they don't have anything mechanical to do with them.''
   Yasushi Nishiyama, maker of the slalom robot, said through an
interpreter, ``After observing all these inventions I notice
Japanese students' inventions seem to be more like toys, something
kids can play with.''
   Most of the Americans' inventions, he added, seemed ``more
practical, something in your daily life that you can actually use.''
   How does that square with the image Americans have of Japanese
students spending endless hours in school or studying?
   ``There are some people who study hard, but there are some who
just enjoy playing,'' Nishiyama said. ``They stay away from that
work. Instead, they try to create something more interesting so
they can enjoy themselves.''
   Two of the young Japanese inventors' devices did have a
practical tilt. Hiroshi Aoyagi, 12, of Tokamachi, built a door that
can slide up or swing out.
   And Yoshitaka Tanimoto, 13, of Takayama City, won top honors,
the Prime Minister's Prize, for inventing a device to help his
grandfather regain use of his hand after a stroke. Tanimoto's hand
rehabilitation machine consists of two crescent shaped handles
attached by strong rubber bands that can be stretched apart.
   The Americans, all honored last June in an Invent America
competition, included Maurice Scales, 8, of Suitland, Md., who came
up with a Plexiglas shield to keep doors from slamming on his
sister's fingers; the portable seat belt for school buses by
Michelle Cardin, 10, of Fairfield, Conn.; an artificial reef to
help young fish by Brian Lloyd, 15, of Jacksonville, Fla.; and a
scheme for solar energy from space by Sachin Patel, 7, of Flatonia,
Texas.
   The U.S. Patent Model Foundation launched Invent America in
December 1986 with corporate financing and moral support from the
Reagan administration. It expects 8 million students in 35,000 U.S.
elementary schools to take part in this year's competition.
   Kazuhiko Hoshino, president of the Japan Institute of Invention
and Innovation, said the visit will help the Japanese youths
``develop new ideas and high creativity.''
   ``In order to cope with the current trend toward
internationalization, we consider it important for Japanese school
students to visit overseas at every opportunity,'' he said.

<HEAD>Defense Witness Says Protocol Fund Wasn't Public Money</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th-8th grafs, `Inaugural Committee ...,' with 7 grafs
to UPDATE with more testimony from L'Ecuyer.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A witness for Gov. Evan Mecham today told
senators considering whether to remove the governor from office
that a fund Mecham is accused of misuing was not public money nor
controlled by state law.
   Political consultant and lawyer Robert L'Ecuyer testified that
Mecham's inaugural committee chairman lacked the authority to bind
the governor to restrictions on how the money could be used.
   Mecham, a first-term Republican, is being tried by the Arizona
Senate on three impeachment counts, including alleged misuse of
$80,000 from a protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership.
   The defense has contended the fund, created with proceeds from
inaugural activities, was not public money, while the prosecution
contends it was.
   L'Ecuyer testified today that because the protocol fund was not
public money in his opinion, Mecham was not restricted by state
laws that govern the use of public funds.
   He said he thought the loan was ``legal but stupid.''
   Inaugural Committee Chairman William Long had told the Maricopa
County Attorney's office in a 1987 letter that the fund would be
used to either benefit the state or to promote citizen
participation in state activities.
   ``The June 26 letter from William Long to the county attorney
was of absolutely no force or effect in relation to the Mecham
inaugural committee funds'' because the fund already had been
turned over to Mecham, and Long no longer chaired the inaugural
committee, L'Ecuyer said.
   L'Ecuyer also described a meeting in May 1987 in which he
agreed, despite misgivings, to advise the governor on Mecham's
plans to publish a tabloid touting his administration.
   ``The governor and I started off with a shouting match,''
L'Ecuyer said. ``The two of us yelled at each other for the better
part of the hour,'' he said, adding that if the tabloid was used as
a campaign tool to attack lawmakers, ``that could become a
violation; people could go to jail for that kind of a violation.''
He did not elaborate.
   The governor cooperated with L'Ecuyer on campaign finance
matters after that meeting, the consultant said.
   L'Ecuyer was hired by Mecham last fall to provide legal opinions
on the propriety of the governor's failure to report a $350,000
campaign loan. The consultant said last fall that Mecham properly
reported the loan by lumping it in with other amounts.
   Mecham faces a charge of concealing the $350,000 loan in both
the impeachment trial and criminal court. The Senate already has
heard testimony on another charge that he tried to thwart an
investigation on an alleged death threat.
   On Monday, senators indicated they were taking a dim view of
Mecham's proposal that they vote now on two of the impeachment
articles, concerning the death threat and the protocol fund,
against him and promise to drop the third regarding the campaign
loan.
   The chances of that happening are ``about as good of me jumping
off the top of the highest building I can find in the
neighborhood,'' said Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, who like
Mecham is a Republican.
   Also Monday, the governor's lawyer, Jerris Leonard, said Monday
that Mecham has ``a firm agreement'' to sell the land and buildings
of his Mecham Pontiac dealership for about $4 million.
   Leonard said he did not know who the prospective buyer was, when
the deal would be closed, or whether Mecham was keeping his Pontiac
franchise.
   During his own testimony Monday on the protocol fund, Mecham
angrily disrupted the proceedings after House prosecutor William
French compared his actions to embezzlement.
   ``I have to make a statement,'' Mecham declared, ignoring orders
from Arizona Supreme Court Justice Frank Gordon to refrain from
comments beyond answering questions asked.
   ``I resent so highly the word embezzlement in my presence,''
Mecham said. ``I'm insulted by it.''
   Gordon admonished Mecham again, telling him: ``I hope you
believe the rules are for you, sir, as well as everybody else.''
   Mecham responded hotly: ``I have seen no witness who has been
insulted as I have been.''
   In his testimony Monday, the governor suggested that the Senate
drop the third charge and vote right away on the first two counts.
   ``If you want to say we'll call this game at the end of six
innings, and do it (vote) then with the fact that that is the game,
why, I don't suppose we could argue with you on that one,'' Mecham
said.
   However, Senate Minority Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat,
agreed with Usdane that it would be ``ridiculous'' to expect the
Senate to drop the $350,000 loan allegation.
   A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate on any one of the
counts is required to convict the governor, automatically removing
him from office. A similar two-thirds vote would be needed to
change the rules to allow an early vote on the first two
impeachment counts.
   Mecham, who also faces a May 17 recall election, is the first
U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades.

   The Seventh National Conference On Humor is
no joke.
   ``To tell you the truth, it may be excruciatingly boring,''
Victor Raskin, a Purdue University English professor coordinating
the weekend conference, said Tuesday.
   ``There will be one lecture on the Peanuts cartoon. I have no
idea how that will turn out,'' said Shaun F.D. Hughes, an associate
professor of English who is helping Raskin coordinate the
conference. ``There will be one on the theory of humor. That tends
to be more deadly.''
   The theme is Midwestern humor. ``There will be some papers on
Mark Twain,'' said Hughes. ``There will be one from Northwestern
University on Chicago political humor.''
   Hughes will ``present a deadly paper. It's called `Physician,
Humor Thyself.' It's Icelandic medical humor. Icelandic people,
they say, have no sense of humor and this tends to bear that out,''
he said.
   Raskin said in a recent university statement: ``In the last
decade, humor has been increasingly recognized as an essential and
universal human facility and as such, has become the subject of
high-powered and widely interdisciplinary research.''
   The conference, at Purdue's West Lafayette campus, will be about
80 percent academic, says Raskin. The last six such conferences
were held at Arizona State University _ always on April Fool's Day.
   ``During the breaks, there may be a lot of laughter,'' said
Raskin. ``Then on Sunday night, there is a public joke-telling
contest. They can tell jokes, juggle, anything to elicit laughter.
The winner gets a purse of maybe $60 or something.''
   But the point, or punchline, is quite serious.
   ``Psychologists want to know why we appreciate humor,'' says
Raskin. ``Sociologists are interested in humor's role in society.
Anthropologists want to know why what is funny to one society is
not funny to another.''
   ``Luckily, some parts of it will be funny,'' says Hughes.
``Sometimes they insert jokes into the lecture.''

<HEAD>State Plans Program for Free Condoms to Medicaid Recipients</HEAD>

   Michigan welfare clients may get free condoms
from their pharmacists in a new program to provide birth control
and help stem the spread of AIDS.
   Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania already
provide condoms for Medicaid recipients by prescription. For
accounting purposes, some state rules require prescriptions for
many items given Medicaid recipients by pharmacists.
   But Michigan apparently will be the first state to provide the
condoms without prescriptions, state and federal officials say.
   The state Department of Social Services is notifying Medicaid
recipients and pharmacists about the program, scheduled to begin
June 1, Chuck Peller, a spokesman for DDS, said Monday.
   The condoms can be obtained by men or women presenting a
Medicaid card to a pharmacist, Peller said.
   There is no specific budget for the program, the state has not
estimated its cost and the DSS has ``no idea of the anticipated
usage,'' Peller said.
   The latest state budget bill included the requirement for free
condoms to Medicaid recipients, Peller said.
   Richard Chambers, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services, said from Washington that he knows of no other
state that authorizes free distribution of condoms without a
prescription.
   The federal government reimburses states for 90 percent of the
costs of family planning services, Chambers said.
   To guard against fraud, including what Peller called ``the
`black market' possibility,''' a recipient's Medicaid number will
be recorded each time condoms are picked up. The state will check
those numbers periodically, he said.
   If the DSS determines a recipient has obtained an unusual number
of condoms, that person will be referred to the agency's Recipient
Monitoring Project in which a prescription would be needed for more
condoms, Peller said.

<TEXT>
   The House Republicans' conference in Houston
last weekend was supposed to be a retreat, but lawmakers joked that
it was more like an advance.
   They led an invading army that included 42 U.S. Capitol police
officers, police dogs, the House physician, the House clerk, office
assistants, reporters, camera crews and the staff of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, which helps run their
campaigns. Many brought their families.
   They traveled with a legion of lobbyists, many of whom helped
finance the three chartered jetliners, lawmakers' hotel rooms and
banquets paid for under the auspices of The Congressional Institute
Inc., a tax-exempt corporation set up for these occasions.
   Sam Richardson, a spokesman for the conference, said the total
cost had not yet been calculated. He said one of the banquets _
canceled later because of a bomb threat _ cost $12,000. Reporters
each were charged $413 for travel and meals, with hotel bills extra.
   One of the goals of the three-day conference was for the 70
lawmakers attending to let their hair down. But the program listed
suit-and-tie or women's business attire for three straight days,
even at a Tex-Mex dinner.
   ``They're going to think we're all a bunch of stuffed shirts,''
complained one member, who got no argument from his wife nearby.
   While in Houston, the Republicans sought some high-tech themes
for their national agenda. They sought camaraderie. They sought a
strategy in their marathon battle to take control of the House back
from the Democrats for the first time in 34 years.
   The thing they surely found, which isn't in evidence much in
Washington, was some humor.
   During the three-day meeting, the GOP squad traveled back and
forth across the city in bus motorcades. Along the way, police
blocked side streets and freeway ramps while frustrated local
motorists didn't know whom to blame.
   ``There is only one thing to do at a time like this,'' one of
the GOP lawmakers said, staring at a line of blocked traffic.
   ``Put a big sign on the bus that says `Mickey Leland Re-election
Committee, Jim Wright, Chairman,''' he said, referring to the local
Democratic congressman and the House speaker.
   The House Republicans didn't use police escorts at their last
get-together a year ago in New York.
   They had asked the NYPD how long it would take to get from their
mid-town hotel to Federal Hall for their meetings.
   ``Thirty-five minutes,'' was the answer. And if they used an
escort?
   ``Forty minutes,'' came the reply.
   At the Houston hotel, a lobbyist from one of the regional phone
companies was handing out complimentary pens. ``Remember, if it
breaks, we only fix the outside. You have to go to AT&T for the
inside,'' he warned.
   The conference was held in a lovely Four Seasons hotel. But
Houston's already summer-sticky weather prompted a reporter to dub
it the ``One Season.''
   Perhaps the highlight of the trip was a spectacular laser and
fireworks show at the Johnson Space Center.
   The climax came when the doors of a huge hangar opened up and
the spectators wandered into a misty night sliced and diced by
lasers stretching across the horizon.
   ``I thought a big clamshell was going to open up and we'd walk
in and fly away,'' one lawmaker quipped about the eerie scene.
   Another seemed concerned that the laser beams were hitting the
nearby Hilton hotel.
   ``I just can't help but thinking,'' he said, ``that there's some
poor salesman up in one of those rooms thinking about fooling
around on his wife. And then he's zapped by a green light beam!
   ``He'll never try that again,'' the congressman predicted.
   By the end of three days, the lawmakers were eager to return to
Washington, and to finish this year's business early so that they
can hit the re-election campaign trail.
   ``We have to go home and tell our constituents this mess isn't
our fault,'' one explained.

   House negotiators working on aid for the
Nicaraguan rebels tried today to resolve a dispute over whether
President Reagan should be able to command quick congressional
action on any military aid request.
   ``We still have significant debate over how a future request
from the president for military aid would be treated,'' Rep. Dick
Cheney of Wyoming, chairman of the House Republican Conference,
said after GOP congressional leaders met with the president.
   Cheney said one possibility discussed was that instead of
spelling out the procedures in the bill, the House would rely on a
promise by Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, that there will be a speedy
vote on such a request.
   ``I think if the speaker would give his word, we would find that
acceptable,'' he said. ``If we can work out an arrangement whereby
the speaker would commit in advance to give us timely consideration
for the vote and he would bring it up under a fair rule, I think
that would solve the problem.''
   Rep. Trent Lott, the House Republican whip, said, ``We would be
willing to take the speaker's word, but we are going to have to
have a clear understanding of what that word means.''
   When asked whether such a ``gentlemen's agreement'' could be
sold to House Republicans, Lott said, ``It would be very difficult,
because while they (the Democrats) say they are suspicious of the
president's request for ... expedited procedures, we don't trust
them either.''
   He said, however, that he believed House Republicans would
support such an agreement if it were worked out between Wright and
House GOP leader Robert Michel of Illinois. Wright and Michel were
in New Jersey today, attending the funeral of Democratic Rep. James
Howard.
   Lott said Reagan ``didn't sign on'' to the idea of such an
agreement but ``I know the president has a lot of faith'' in
Michel, Cheney and Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., the principal
negotiators.
   ``If they can get something that they can accept and work with,
I am sure that will carry a lot of weight with the president,''
Lott said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the dollar amounts
of aid mentioned in the negotiations, ranging from $30 million to
less than $50million, were acceptable to Reagan.
   ``The issue is not money but how fast we can get it'' to help
assure the survival of the Nicaraguan Contra rebels as a fighting
force, Fitzwater said. ``We want it as fast as we can get it,'' he
said.
   He added that the issue of an acceptable means of delivering aid
to the Contras is ``still an open question'' to be worked out by
the negotiators, subject to proposals for cease-fire zones in
Nicaragua.
   Leaders of the chamber worked for five hours Monday on the
package, and roughed out a six-month, $40 million aid bill that
would send strictly ``humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing, medicine
and shelter _ while the rebels negotiate a permanent peace with the
country's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``We reached some general understandings in a number of areas,
but there were some stumbling points,'' said House Democratic Whip
Tony Coelho of California, who added that meetings would resume
today.
   Coelho held out hope that an agreement still could be forged in
time to bring the matter to the House floor on Wednesday and permit
the Senate time to act and get the aid flowing before Easter. He
cited reports that the rebels may exhaust their basic supplies
within a week or two.
   The $40 million would keep supplies flowing to the rebels as
they wait out the continuing negotiations in cease-fire zones
inside Nicaragua. The aid would flow at a rate comparable to that
provided before Feb. 29, when the last U.S. support ran out. The
package also would include $10 million to pay the expenses of a
commission to verify compliance with the peace accord.
   ``For this (peace) effort to work, there's got to be this aid,''
said Adolfo Calero, a leader of the rebel political directorate,
who met with Wright and other congressional leaders on the aid
package.
   Any new aid for the Contras would have to conform to the
requirements of a 60-day truce reached last week between the rebels
and the Managua government.
   That agreement said the Contras would receive only humanitarian
aid and that the aid would be routed through ``neutral
organizations.'' The CIA has delivered past U.S. aid supplies to
the Contras.
   Calero said he told Wright and House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill., that the term ``neutral organizations'' meant a
commercial transport company acceptable to the rebels, and not a
relief organization such as the Red Cross, which Wright had
previously mentioned as the delivery agent.
   Other details of the package remained to be determined, such as
whether it would include communications gear for the rebels or
special programs such as a $14 million effort to help children who
are victims of the nearly 7-year-old civil war, which has claimed
some 40,000 lives.
   Republicans wary of Sandinista promises have sought to give
Reagan the right to a quick, guaranteed vote in Congress on a later
request for new military aid to the Contras if the peace process
breaks down. As expected, that was proving to be the most difficult
issue.
   Wright and Michel were seeking a compromise that would indicate
continued U.S. backing for the rebels during the cease-fire, but
would give Congress the final say on the nature of any future aid
package.
   After meeting Monday with the Contra leadership, Secretary of
State George P. Shultz told reporters it would ``certainly be
desirable'' to have assurances of quick action on additional aid to
the Contras if the peace talks break down, and Calero agreed.
   In last wek's agreement, the Sandinistas promised a general
amnesty for the rebels, which began with the release Sunday of 100
prisoners. They also committed themselves to a restoration of the
rights of free speech and political participation, in return for
the 60-day cease-fire and the relocation of Contra forces into
special zones.
   Representatives of the two sides are meeting this week to work
out the details of a long-term cease-fire, including when the
rebels will lay down their weapons.

   Rep. Richard Gephardt took an aggressive tack
in his Democratic presidential bid, but he bowed out of the race in
a mellower mood with family and friends at his side. He filed for
re-election to his House seat today, declaring himself happy.
   ``I have no complaints today;. I'm the luckiest guy in the
world,'' Gephardt said Monday after announcing his withdrawal at an
upbeat news conference that contrasted with the grim economic
tidings he purveyed in his campaign.
   ``We did the best we possibly could,'' he said. ``We made our
mistakes and we lost.''
   In Jefferson City, Mo., today, the Missouri congressman filed
for re-election to the 3rd Congressional District seat from St.
Louis, a seat he has held since 1976.
   ``I am very happy to be here. It's a good thing I didn't wait
another day,'' Gephardt quipped, referring to the fact that today
was the filing deadline.
   Gephardt was accompanied by his wife and mother.
   On Monday, he said he intended to be back in the thick of House
business on Wednesday and, in a variation on his campaign message
to the economically disadvantaged, pledged that ``your fight will
always be my fight, too.''
   Gephardt, 47, ran some of the most negative TV ads of the
campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. But he was
pushing party unity on Monday.
   ``I think our candidate is going to come from the people that
are running now for the presidency and I think we're going to put a
Democrat in the White House in 1988,'' said Gephardt, who is
chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.
   He declined when asked to give advice to Dukakis, noting the
governor's delegate lead and ruefully admitting that ``Michael
Dukakis has sure done a lot better than I did. I don't think it's
my place to tell him what to do.''
   As for Jesse Jackson, who trounced both Gephardt and Dukakis
last Saturday in the Michigan caucuses, Gephardt commented: ``I
think Jesse Jackson can be nominated and I think he can be
elected.''
   Gephardt refused to endorse anyone in the race but said he might
do so later. Asked about the prospects of him running again in the
future, Gephardt said he expected a Democrat to be elected this
fall and re-elected in 1992. ``Nineteen-ninety-six is so far off I
can't even see it,'' he said.
   Most of Gephrdt's 167 delegates went into the uncommitted
column, but Missouri state party rules mandate that the at-large
and public official delegates are re-divided among the active
candidates when a contender drops out.
   According to the latest AP delegate count, Jackson had 606.55,
Dukakis 605.55, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. 362.8, Sen. Paul Simon 168.5
and uncommitted 515.6.
   Gephardt began campaigning in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state,
some two years ago on the theory that an Iowa victory would
translate into momentum and his campaign would take off. He did win
Iowa, as well as South Dakota and his home state, but his candidacy
never developed broad appeal.
   Looking back, Gephardt attributed the failure to a lack of
resources and said that where he was able to get his ideas across,
``we did connect.'' But he added, ``I have no alibis. We lost, no
question about that.''
   He said he did not blame his defeats on either his position as a
House member, a difficult jumping-off place, or press coverage that
some considered unduly negative.
   ``By and large, the press has been fair to Dick Gephardt. I
didn't like every article that was written, but I'm not supposed
to,'' he said.
   Gephardt was a pragmatic consensus builder in the House and many
news stories focused on his transition to anti-establishment
populist with controversial ideas on trade and farms.
   ``Gephardt was an insider trying to run as an outsider and he
got creamed for it,'' said Robert Lichter, a media analyst logging
all election stories on the three networks' evening news shows this
year.
   Gephardt was also vulnerable because he had switched positions
on issues ranging from abortion to Reaganomics over the years.
   The well-heeled Dukakis ran a television ad showing a man
flip-flopping through the air and another with a list of Gephardt's
corporate contributors. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee not only
attacked Gephardt on his changes of heart, but appropriated the
same populist theme.
   After Michigan, Gehpardt had less than one-third the delegate
totals amassed by Dukakis and Jackson and fewer than even Sen. Paul
Simon of Illinois, who didn't compete in the 20 contests on Super
Tuesday, March 8.

   The No. 2 official in the Justice Department
and the head of the department's criminal division abruptly
resigned today amid continuing legal problems for their boss,
Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney
General William Weld announced in letters to President Reagan that
they were stepping down, with Weld's resignation effective at the
close of business today.
   The first Meese knew of their plans was when Burns and Weld
walked into the attorney general's office at 8 a.m. and announced
they were stepping aside, said a department source, speaking on
condition of anonymity. The news was announced to department
officials at the morning staff meeting a half hour later. Both have
served since Oct. 17, 1986.
   Two assistants to Burns _ Randy Levine and Boykin Rose _ and two
assistants to Weld _ Mark Robinson and Jane Serene _ also resigned.
   The officials provided no explanation for their sudden actions,
but the source said Meese's continuing legal problems were
``definitely a factor'' in the resignations.
   Meese has been under criminal investigation for nearly a year.
   Neither Burns nor Weld mentioned Meese's legal problems in their
resignation letters.
   Questioned about the resignations, Sen. Strom Thurmond, ranking
Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ``I am greatly
concerned about morale at the Department of Justice as indicated by
the resignation of these two men and of four additional officials
who I am informed have also resigned.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said he was ``surprised to see
them leaving at this period of time'' and added, ``It certainly
doesn't signify a great deal of confidence in the attorney
general.'' But the senator said he did not know why the officials
quit.
   Assistant Republican floor leader Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., who
also serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ``If you
believe in fairness, you have to wait and see'' what caused the
resignations.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said White House
officials were informed of the resignations on Monday. He said
Reagan accepted them ``with regret'' this morning and thanked Burns
and Weld for serving ``with distinction.''
   Fitzwater said he didn't believe the two departing officials
spoke directly to Reagan, and he said he was only aware of the
reasons they gave in their resignation letters. The spokesman said
Reagan continues to have ``full confidence'' in Meese and the
Justice Department.
   Fitzwater said the resignations did not cause any particular
concern among Reagan and his advisers. ``We have people resigning
all the time, especially late in the administration,'' he said.
   Burns' resignation is effective April 22. Weld's temporary
replacement will be John Keeney, a deputy in the criminal division.
   The resignations, combined with the departure of Associate
Attorney General Stephen S. Trott to become a federal judge, leave
a leadership vacuum of major proportions in the Justice Department.
   Burns' letter to Reagan said that ``under your leadership, I
believe we have made important contributions to the administration
of justice. ... Unfortunately, I have regretfully concluded that I
must return to private life at this time.''
   Weld, a former U.S. attorney in Boston who has prosecuted a
number of important public corruption and white-collar crime cases,
told Reagan that ``I am grateful to have been charged with the
responsibility of seeing that justice be done without fear or
favor.''
   Another department source, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that neither Burns nor Weld acted in the belief
that Meese is about to be indicted.
   However, said the source, both men are concerned because the
Justice Department's image continues to be damaged due to the
ongoing criminal investigation of Meese, the nation's top law
enforcement officer.
   Terry Eastland, a Justice Department spokesman, pointed out that
it is not unusual for political appointees to leave government in
the last year of an administration.
   Eastland said that Burns, Weld and Trott, who was confirmed as a
judge last week, were sworn into their jobs in 1986 and that ``this
is 1988; this happens to be a year when people are leaving and they
all happen to be leaving at the same time.''
   Meese has been under investigation for 11 months. Independent
counsel James McKay launched the probe last May 11 to look into
Meese's involvement with the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. The
investigation has expanded to include his involvement in a $1
billion Iraqi pipeline project.
   Meese got involved in both Wedtech and the pipeline through his
longtime friend, E. Robert Wallach.
   This morning, former National Security Adviser William Clark was
testifying before a federal grand jury in connection with the
pipeline project. McKay's office is presenting evidence to the
grand jury.
   McKay's probe is in its final phase, say sources familiar with
the investigation, but it could continue for at least another month
or two.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge climbed 0.9 percent in February, a sharp rebound following
several months of weakness after the October stock market collapse,
the Commerce Department reported today.
   The gain in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was the
biggest increase since last June. It followed declines of 1.1
percent in January, 0.1 percent in October and 1.2 percent in
November.
   Only a 0.4 percent rise in December kept the index from posting
consecutive declines for three or more months, the traditional
signal of an impending recession.
   But with the big February increase, analysts said they believe
the leading index is accurately signaling that the economy slowed
in the early part of 1988 but the country will avoid a recession
this year.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the index ``shows
that the economy is very promising.''
   ``The size and broad-based nature of last month's index of
leading indicators are encouraging,'' Fitzwater said.
   The 0.9 percent February increase was led by a big jump in
applications for building permits, which provided over half of the
strength last month.
   In all, five of the available nine indicators were positive
forces on the index. After building permits, the biggest
contributors were a drop in new unemployment claims, a rise in
stock prices, an increase in the growth of the money supply and
higher orders for consumer goods.
   Four of the indicators held the index back. The biggest negative
factor was a decline in the length of the average manufacturing
workweek, followed by a decline in orders for plant and equipment,
a change in raw materials prices and a speed-up in business
delivery times, considered a negative because it is often a sign of
dropping demand.
   The various changes left the index at 190.6 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   The jump in the February index was one of a string of recent
reports showing better-than-expected strength in the early part of
1988.
   Many economists believe the strong reports have all but
eliminated the chances of a recession this year.
   ``Right now the economy is looking a lot better than we thought
it was going to look three months ago,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass.
   At the end of last year, economists were worried about a huge
build-up of unsold products which they feared would lead to
declines in factory orders and rising unemployment as businesses
scaled back production plans.
   While there have been some production declines, notably in the
auto industry, employment has risen sharply in the first two months
of the year, pushing the jobless rate down to an 8{-year low of 5.7
percent in February.
   These job gains along with other economic reports have eased
recession worries, good news for Republicans hoping to hold onto
the White House this year.
   The Reagan administration is predicting that the overall
economy, as measured by the gross national product, will expand at
a modest 2.4 percent rate this year, a forecast which is only
slightly more optimistic than the predictions being made by many
private economists.
   The government's first look at overall economic growth will not
come until next month when the Commerce Department releases its
first estimate of the performance of the GNP during the
January-March quarter.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
believed the GNP grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first
quarter and will drop to a rate of 1 percent in the April-June
quarter before picking up strength in the last half of the year.
   While this would represent sluggish growth, it is a significant
improvement from Evans' earlier forecast that the country would be
in a recession in the early part of this year.
   ``The economy is sluggish but not declining, and by the second
half of the year, we should see better growth,'' Evans said.

   Journalists have special protection against
court-ordered disclosure of notes, photographs and other
information gathered on a non-confidential basis, New York's
highest court ruled Tuesday.
   In a 6-0 ruling, the state Court of Appeals formulated for the
first time a test to be used when courts are asked to require
disclosure. The test, the court said, protects reporters more than
other people against divulging information.
   ``The autonomy of the press would be jeopardized if resort to
its resource materials, by litigants seeking to utilize the
newsgathering efforts of journalists for their private purposes,
were routinely permitted,'' Judge Stewart Hancock Jr. wrote for the
court.
   Hancock added that ``because journalists typically gather
information about accidents, crimes and other matters of special
interest that often give rise to litigation,'' requiring routine
disclosure of those materials ``would be widespread.''
   The ruling said courts can order journalists to turn over
non-confidential information only if it is ``highly material'' to
the litigation, ``critical'' to the claim being brought in court
and ``not otherwise available.''
   The case before the court involved attempts by a man injured in
an auto accident at a construction site to sue the contractors. A
photographer for the Gannett Rochester Newspapers took 58
photographs of the accident scene, one of which was published in
the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle.
   Lawyers for the man sought copies of all the pictures in the
process of building its case.
   Gannett refused, but two state courts, state Supreme Court in
Monroe County and the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court,
ruled that since the photographs were gathered on a
non-confidential basis, their disclosure wasn't protected under the
state Shield Law.
   Peter Danziger, who filed a brief with the court in the case on
behalf of the New York State Newspaper Publishers Association and
several news organizations, called the ruling ``a tremendous
victory for the public and the press.''
   Danziger's brief was filed on behalf of The Associated Press,
Newsday, The New York Times, Ottaway Newspapers, Advance
Publications, Capital Cities-ABC Inc., CBS Inc. and NBC Inc.

   President Reagan's chief spokesman expressed
outrage today at violence against anti-government marchers in
Panama and said ``there are limits to our patience.''
   While restating that it has been U.S. policy not to intervene
militarily, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also said, ``It has always
been a principle that we will protect American citizens as best we
can.''
   Meanwhile, ousted Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle
asked the United States and other democracies to send a military
force to Panama to remove strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Delvalle, who has been in hiding since he was deposed from
office a month ago, relayed the message through Ambassador Juan B.
Sosa, who said he will formally convey the request to the State
Department.
   ``We are all angry at this latest demonstration, at people being
beaten and threatened,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``I just want to express the outrage of all of us about this
incident,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said the Noriega regime ``is showing its true colors.
It is desperate and afraid of its own people and the free press.''
   ``The people of Panama as well as the leaders arrested yesterday
have demonstrated their determination to take on the Noriega
regime, despite these heavy-handed efforts at intimidation,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``The thousands of Panamanians who braved tear gas, skin
irritant sprays and birdshot yestrerday show that intimidation will
not solve Noriega's problems.''
   The spokesman said the United States continued to recommend that
American citizens defer travel to Panama, and that those who do go
there avoid political gatherings and exercise caution.
   ``We continue to consider options for dealing with the
problem,'' he said.
   ``I think it's clear that there are limits to the activities of
Mr. Noriega and limits to our patience and our policy endurance,''
he said. ``It has always been a principle that we will protect
American citizens as best we can and, while we have said that we
don't plan to go in militarily, it's also important to note that
there are limits.''
   Troops firing shotguns, tear gas and water cannon routed
thousands of anti-government marchers Monday, then stormed a hotel
to arrest opposition activists and journalists.
   Several people were injured and dozens were arrested, witnesses
said, in one of the largest protests in months against Noriega.
   Security agents forced their way at gunpoint into the offices of
NBC, CBS, ABC and CNN. Tapes, including footage of the day's march,
were confiscated. Eight foreign journalists, including Americans,
were detained for several hours before being released.
   When asked if any action was expected today, Fitzwater replied,
``I can't say in advance that anything is expected today, but I
would remind you that our concern and monitoring is on a daily
basis.''
   He was asked whether the president had any meetings on the
subject today and answered, ``No, not that I can comment on.''
   He said the U.S. troops stationed at the Panama Canal had not
been placed on special alert but ``are in a position to respond
appropriately.''
   ``They are there and they are our troops and they are available
for whatever needs might arise,'' he said.
   ``We are certainly concerned by this threat to Americans and
find it a very difficult turn of events and one that is contrary to
assurances that we have received in the past,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``I do want to say, when I say that our endurance is not
unlimited, that we certainly are willing to take a look at all the
hard options, but our policy remains the same and our intention
that we would not be using military force,'' Fitzwater said.
   Declaring that Panama is being held hostage by Noriega, Sosa
told a news conference the United States and other nations must
join together to force the removal of Noriega.
   ``We're asking the international community to help,'' Sosa said.
``We're paying the price. But we've got no weapons. Give us
weapons.''
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman called the raid on the
hotel a ``shocking demonstration of the anti-democratic nature of
the Noriega regime and Noriega's alarming willingness to use brutal
tactics as his position in Panama deteriorates.
   He had no comment on Sosa's appeal for an international force.
In previous days, the administration has sidestepped that issue,
declining to say what options it has under consideration.

   President Reagan looked so old and careworn
after he was told of the Challenger explosion in which seven space
pioneers died that spokesman Larry Speakes refused to release a
photograph of him to the press.
   Speakes' account of the scene in the Oval Office on Jan. 28,
1986, is one of a number vignettes of the Reagan White House that
the former chief presidential spokesman provides in a new book,
``Speaking Out,'' scheduled for publication May 1 by Charles
Scribner's Sons.
   ``A White House photographer rushed in to record the moment,''
Speakes writes. ``The president had the saddest look on his face I
have ever seen. He also looked extremely old. That photograph was
so unflattering that I refused to release it to the press.''
   Speakes, who became vice president for communications at Merrill
Lynch after leaving the White House in February 1987, writes as an
admirer of the president, but adds that he is ``not blind to the
man's flaws and weaknesses.''
   During the first year or two of the administration, he says,
aides failed to keep Reagan abreast of what was going on in the
news.
   ``When there was a lapse of much time between press interviews
or news conferences, he would be totally out of the swim on what
was in the press and what had happened two weeks ago, and it would
be like reinventing the wheel to get him prepared,'' the former
spokesman says.
   He said Reagan ``does not read many newspapers thoroughly'' and
``his habit is to read the comics first.''
   Although the president frequently uses sports metaphors and
stories, Speakes says Reagan is not really an avid fan.
   ``He talks baseball at World Series time and football at Super
Bowl time but does not follow those sports regularly, and he knows
next to nothing about sports other than baseball and football,''
the former spokesman writes.
   When the Iran-Contra arms and money affair broke, says Speakes,
``My own advice to the president, which I gave him several times,
was to admit that he had made a mistake.'' Reagan never quite
brought himself to do that.
   Discussing whether Reagan knew of the diversion of Iran arms
sale profits to Nicaragua's Contra rebels, the former White House
aide says: ``Frankly, I don't believe the man can tell a lie. The
man can make a mistake and the man can hear something so many times
that he believes something is true when it really isn't, but he
simply isn't a liar. I have no doubt that (indicted former National
Security Council aide Oliver) North thought the president knew what
was going on, but North was wrong.''
   Speakes has pungent words for members of the president's
personal and official families, although in his six years as the
principal White House spokesman, he presented a glowing portrait of
them and turned aside reports of bickering and dissension.
   In the book, co-authored with Robert Pack, he writes of the
president's daughter, Maureen: ``You didn't want to stir her up.
Maureen is ... a straightforward, punch-you-in-the-nose type. Her
husband, Dennis Revell, seems to live in mortal fear of her. I've
seen her cut him down one side and up the other, and he just stands
there and takes it.''
   Of first lady Nancy Reagan, he writes: ``Mrs. Reagan is more
circumspect, more likely to stab you in the back.''
   Elaine Crispen, the first lady's press secretary, said Mrs.
Reagan had not read the book and would have no comment. Susanne
Rich, an aide to the president's daughter, did not respond to a
request for Ms. Reagan's reaction.
   Speakes' successor at the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, said
Reagan heard a number of comments about the book from reporters
during a speaking trip to Richmond, Va., on Monday, but ``in an
amazing show of discipline and self-determination, the president
said nothing.''
   ``I don't think I want to comment on Larry Speakes' book,''
Fitzwater added.
   Writing of John Poindexter, North's boss, who also has been
indicted, Speakes says that when he showed Poindexter a message
saying the first news of the Iran arms deals had broken in the
press in Iran, ``he maintained a poker face, betraying no emotion
at all. In retrospect, he gave an Academy Award-winning
performance.''
   Of Vice President George Bush, Speakes says ``the popular image
may be accurate: that he does not have a strong philosophical base,
that he is not decisive, that he is not willing to take stands on
the big issues.''
   As for former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, he was ``a
hardliner, a small man, a whiny type of guy. With a green eyeshade,
he would have looked just like an accountant instead of the head of
our largest governmental department.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Battles Doubts, Jackson; Bush Cleans Up</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Polls close at 8 p.m. EST</NOTE>

   Michael Dukakis battled Jesse Jackson as
well as increasing doubts about his Democratic presidential
candidacy in the Connecticut primary on Tuesday. Vice President
George Bush coasted on the Republican side as vanquished rival Bob
Dole readied to quit the race.
   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Bush both aimed to cement
six-state New England sweeps, but their similarities ended there.
   Dukakis led Jackson, the man with momentum in the race, as well
as Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Sen. Paul Simon with about 50 percent
of the vote in one pre-election poll.
   The governor hoped for a victory big enough to reassure the
skeptics after his landslide loss to Jackson in the Michigan
caucuses last weekend and his third-place finish in the Illinois
primary on March 15.
   Jackson aimed for a strong second-place showing that would
embarrass Dukakis in his own back yard and give fresh impetus to
the campaign that has been the Democratic surprise of the year.
   Gore spent an estimated $75,000 on television advertising in
hopes of demonstrating strength in the Northeast.
   In contrast to the Democratic disarray, Bush's Super Tuesday
spectacular showing on March 8 turned his campaign into a stately
march toward the nomination. Dole, his once-strong tormenter,
arranged a withdrawal speech in Washington while the polls were
open in Connecticut.
   That left Pat Robertson as Bush's only surviving challenger. But
he has signaled that he is a candidate in name only, and is
spending the time between now and the GOP convention developing a
network of supporters for 1992.
   Connecticut's primary offered 35 delegates to the Republican
National Convention, and 52 on the Democratic side.
   Before the returns from Connecticut were read, The Associated
Press delegate count looked this way:
   Bush had 788 delegates, to 17 for Robertson. It takes 1,139 to
claim the nomination.
   Jackson and Dukakis both had 606.5, with 2,082 needed to gain
the Democratic nomination. Gore had 365 and Simon 169.
   Simon made little effort in Connecticut, and Rep. Richard
Gephardt dropped out of the Democratic race on Monday.
   But Dukakis was still suffering the effects of wounds received
in Illinois and Michigan. And anything less than an overpowering
victory in next-door Connecticut would do little to quell the
complaints that his candidacy lacks spark.
   Thus, Connecticut looked merely like a prelude to bigger
Democratic battles to come.
   Gore and Simon were planning costly television advertising in
Wisconsin ahead of next Tuesday's primary there. Jackson was
running virtually even with Dukakis in polls there, taken before
the former civil rights leader scored his Michigan landslide.
   Further away were the two big industrial state battles in New
York and Pennsylvania. Thus, despite Gephardt's withdrawal, the
Democratic race seemed as muddled as ever.
   Even before Dole's speech, Bush had begun turning his attention
toward the fall campaign. Campaign officials said he had decided to
name business executive Fred V. Malek to oversee his activities at
the Republican National Convention.
   In a sign of gathering Republican unity, former contender Jack
Kemp returned to the campaign to endorse Bush at a news conference
in Wisconsin.
   Dole's withdrawal came less than two months after he handily
defeated Bush in the lead-off Iowa caucuses. But he then lost New
Hampshire's primary and three weeks later, was shut out in all 17
Super Tuesday states.
   The Democratic race couldn't have been more confusing.
   Michigan gave the momentum to Jackson. But he is a black,
liberal candidate whom many party officials believe cannot possibly
win the White House, and thus should not be nominated.
   His enhanced standing in the race prompted an extraordinary
public debate among party officials about the possibility or
desirability of organizing a stop-Jackson movement.
   Jackson campaigned vigorously in Connecticut as he tried to
build on the momentum he received from his win in Michigan. He
sometimes seemed to aim his message at the party's bigwigs around
the country as well as at the voters of a single state.
   ``If at the end of California, we have the most popular votes
and the most delegate votes, becoming the nominee is logical and
proper,'' he said on Monday.
   He challenged the notion that party leaders could turn to
someone else at the convention.
   ``They would not have given me the nomination. I would have
earned it from the people,'' he said.
   Dukakis had spent considerable energy in recent days
constructing a bandwagon designed to carry him to the nomination.
He was winning endorsement after endorsement to go with campaign
organization and financing that is the envy of other contenders _
and was backed in Connecticut by Gov. William O'Neill and Sen.
Christopher Dodd.
   But his poor showing in Michigan prompted several party leaders
to publicly question his ability to generate support. And it has
raised anew speculation about a deadlocked party convention casting
about for a non-candidate to be its nominee.
   Dukakis' aides were confident their man would win Connecticut _
but penciled in a few additional campaign appearances on Monday
after the results of Michigan had sunk in.
   For his part, Dukakis was reluctant to take on Jackson directly.
   ``I'm not running against (Jackson) and he is not running
against me. We are running for the presidency,'' he told one
questioner.
   Gore initially said he hoped to surprise Dukakis in Connecticut.
But he seemed to have shifted his focus to Wisconsin and the New
York primary on April 19 in his bid to show he can attract votes
outside his native South.
   Simon, a favorite son winner in Illinois on March 15, decided to
stay out of Connecticut and point instead toward Wisconsin. Aides
said he might reassess his campaign _ shorthand for withdrawal _ if
he did poorly there.

   Some merchants in this beach city
say the loss of the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library will hurt
tourism so much they may be forced to close.
   But one historian suggests a museum dedicated to the president
who once lived here could be the answer.
   ``Nixon was here for 11 years and cannot be neglected,'' said
San Clemente Historical Society President Charles Ashbaugh. ``It's
not a case of apathy in the city. It's just that everyone has
thrown their hands up and said, `What can we do now?'''
   A 13-acre blufftop property owned by the Lusk Co. was targeted
for several years as the future home of the library. But it was
tied to a private development, and after numerous delays, Nixon
decided to put the library in Yorba Linda, where he was born. Nixon
now lives in Saddle River, N.J.
   With the library and its estimated 40 million pages of official
documents, photographs, videotapes, recordings and gifts from
foreign leaders went merchants' dreams of tourist dollars.
   ``I'm going to close my business,'' said Mike Lazarus, who has
owned a shop called Jeans Alley for 13 years. ``Now that the town
blew it and lost the library ... that really killed the town
business-wise. The city had expected it to bring anywhere from
300,000 to 600,000 people here a year.''
   A group called Citizens for a Responsive Council tried
unsuccessfully to recall three City Council members after the loss
of the library.
   ``I think there are some people who are bitter out there, who
have invested some time and money into the city becoming a resort
center and who thought they were going to make some money on the
tourist thing,'' said Tom Davis, spokesman for the Chamber of
Commerce.
   The historical society holds such trinkets as presidential
matchbooks and playing cards, toothpaste from China and menus from
state dinners.
   Meanwhile, Ashbaugh is trying to establish a museum in honor of
the nation's 37th president, and Olen Hanson, the city's founder.
It would be located in Hanson's former home, a 20-room villa called
Casa Romantica.
   The home's current owner, George Welsh, wants to sell, but does
not want the estate bulldozed for development. Interested buyers
include two developers, one of whom would give the house to the
historical society and build condos nearby; and the city, which
would provide half the house for a museum.

   The Grammy-award winning rock group U2 left for
Hollywood Tuesday to finish work on a film of their lives on tour
which leader Bono promised will be a ``work of art.''
   The four-man Irish band, which won Grammies for best group and
best album this year, is funding the film directed by Phil Joanou,
a protege of Steven Spielberg.
   ``It will be totally unlike any other rock film,'' said Bono.
``It will be a work of art _ on the lines of (the Beatles' film) `A
Hard Day's Night' with a touch of Spielberg thrown in.
   ``The cameraman followed us everywhere _ on stage, to the
bathroom and even to bed. No secret has been left untold,'' he said.
   Most of the shooting has been completed but the film has to be
edited, he said.
   The group grossed more than $26 million on its 1987 tour to
promote their album, ``The Joshua Tree.''

   Country and western star Bill Anderson and
his Po' Boys band picked the right service station when their bus
broke down.
   The entertainers found Ryan Stevens working at a station in this
city 65 miles northeast of Indianapolis when they pulled in
Saturday looking for a quick replacement vehicle. Stevens and his
family, who are big fans of Anderson, were eager to help out.
   The band rented a truck for its equipment while Don Stevens,
Ryan's father, and a friend offered their cars to help the group
get to their engagement in St. Johns, Mich. The Stevens family and
two friends accompanied the band on the four-hour trip.
   ``They was just so sweet to us,'' said Joannie Cunningham, one
of the friends. ``He's a millionaire, a member of the Grand Ole
Opry. You know, he was really just an all right person.''
   ``I hope he remembers Marion as a place where people helped out
instead of where he broke down,'' Don Stevens said.

   More than 70 performing artists from
the Soviet Union relaxed with vodka, food, sports and song during a
party at the Kennedy compound hosted by Edward M. Kennedy Jr., the
senator's son.
   Members of the Bolshoi and the Pokrovsky Folk Ensemble attended
the party Monday at the Kennedy family's oceanfront complex of
homes.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was watching the Bolshoi Ballet perform
in Boston last week when he was reminded that his late brother,
Robert Kennedy, had invited the ballet members to Hyannis Port 25
years ago.
   The senator asked his son to throw another party, which Ted Jr.
did with the help of sister Kara Kennedy and cousin Michael Kennedy.
   Soviet composer Karen Khatchaturian, on a tour of John F.
Kennedy's home, bowed before the late president's portrait. ``I am
happy to see this place for my own eyes,'' he said. ``This is one
of the strongest feelings I have had in America. This is a sacred

   D.J. Smith claims he's a victim of double
jeopardy because the TV game show ``Jeopardy'' won't pay him $5,000
he won.
   ``Jeopardy'' disqualified Smith from $5,000 in winnings because
the 55-year-old business analyst won $1,200 on ``Wheel of Fortune''
on Thanksgiving Day. Game show rules enacted after a 1958 scandal
prohibit contestants from appearing on game shows more than once a
year.
   ``I feel like I'm in double jeopardy,'' Smith said. ``They won't
give me my money, and they won't let me be on the show again.''
   Smith said he disclosed his ``Wheel'' appearance to a
``Jeopardy'' representative who invited him to play in a seniors
tournament on the ABC show in January. He said he mentioned his
earlier appearance again when he filled out a ``Jeopardy''
registration form.
   Smith said he won a berth in a semifinal contest and $5,000
before being told his appearance on ``Wheel'' disqualified him.
Game show officials withheld the money but did award him a $1,000
quarterfinalist prize.
   ``We didn't enjoy having to do that,'' said George Vosburgh,
``Jeopardy'' producer. ``Even though the network stressed (the
rules), it got by him and it got by us.''

   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Tuesday
he has evidence that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's troops are
trying to sabotage the Panama Canal, and he called on President
Reagan to quickly take ``whatever steps necessary to bring about
Noriega's removal.''
   D'Amato, while declining to specify his sources, said he has
obtained ``information that the Panama Defense Forces are now
actively looking to sabotage the canal.''
   He said he knows of one attempt ``to cut the wires to disable
one of the locks,'' and of other episodes in which canal employees
were threatened and beaten.
   With Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Panamanian Ambassador Juan B.
Sosa, a Noriega opponent, at his side, D'Amato declared at a news
conference that ``the crisis in Panama is becoming more and more a
danger to the security of the United States.''
   ``Many Cuban intelligence officers and technical people are
being flown into Panama,'' he said. ``The strategically important
canal is the next step. It would be tragic if the canal fell into
(Cuban President Fidel) Castro's hands.''
   Neither senator called directly for armed intervention by the
United States, but D'Amato declared that ``decisive action is
imperative. The longer we delay, the Cubanization of Panama becomes
a very real threat ... and we run the risk of losing the support of
the people of Panama.''
   ``I'm not going to specifically suggest the means,'' said
D'Amato. ``But we have the force necessary to bring about the legal
removal of Noriega.''
   Kerry agreed, saying he cannot understand why ``part of the
administration is working on a policy that says `Noriega must go,'
and part of it is working on how we deal with him if he manages to
stay on.''
   D'Amato said he had expressed his views earlier in the day to
Defense Department officials, and expected Reagan to get the
message via the media. ``We have not seen the decisive action from
the president that this situation calls for,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in decrying the use of
violence by Noriega's forces, restated Tuesday that it has been
U.S. policy not to intervene militarily. But he also said, ``It has
always been a principle that we will protect American citizens as
best we can.''

<HEAD>Soviet, US Doctors Disagree On Telling Patients Of Cancer
Diagnosis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Soviet doctors participating in an
international teleconference said Tuesday they routinely conceal
the truth from patients diagnosed as having cancer and they
questioned the American practice of fully informing patients of a
tumorous condition.
   ``It's hardly a good idea to tell a patient directly that he has
a cancer,'' said Dr. Nikolai Napalkov, president of the U.S.S.R.
Oncological Society and a leading cancer researcher in the Soviet
Union. ``Only in rare cases, when the patient refuses treatment,
does the doctor have the obligation to tell the patient.''
   American doctors taking part in the conference strongly
disagreed.
   ``The sense of trust that exists between a dcotor and patient is
very important,'' said Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of surgery at
the National Cancer Institute. ``It's impossible for me to imagine
giving quality care without telling the patient the full story.''
   The exchange came during a two-hour conference which used a
satellite to link researchers at the National Institutes of Health
near Washington with Soviet experts at a studio in Moscow.
   The conference, called ``The Cancer Summit,'' included
pre-recorded comments from President and Mrs. Reagan, both of whom
have been treated for cancer, and the reading of a statement by
Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Mrs. Reagan, who has undergone surgery for breast cancer, said
that ``cancer is bigger than any one country; it is a problem of
all mankind.''
   The first lady said that she had ``always thought cancer would
strike someone else, another family.'' But, she said, both she and
her husband developed cancers that were surgically removed.
   ``We have been fortunate recipients of advanced medical
science,'' she said.
   Reagan, who has been treated for colon cancer, struck the same
theme in his brief remarks.
   The president told doctors of the two nations, ``we are
depending on all of you in your combined wisdom to win the battle
over this disease and, in doing so, to improve the length and
quality of human life for all mankind.''
   Gorbachev, in a statement read during the telecast, said cancer
is an enemy that is striking humans in countries everywhere.
   Though there has been progress, Gorbachev said, ``the enemy is
far from routed, he is not retreating and is threatening everybody,
and the fight calls for vigorous and concerted action.''
   Much of the two-hour teleconference featured films and slides
illustrating cancer research and treatment under way in the two
countries, with Rosenberg presenting the only report of new
scientific findings.
   Rosenberg said that a new treatment under study uses what he
calls tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. These are natural
cancer-fighting cells that are extracted from the patient's tumor
and then purified, concentrated and reinjected into the patient.
The lymphocytes then attack the tumor.
   The technique is ``in the infancy of development'' and still far
from ready for general clinical use, said Rosenberg, but he
reported that eight out of nine patients who have received the
treatment have been helped.
   Napalkov brought up the question of how much to tell cancer
patients about their condition. He introduced an informal filmed
person-on-the-street poll in which most Soviet citizens asked said
they would prefer not to be told if they have been diagnosed as ill
with cancer.
   Napalkov said Soviet doctors believe it best to keep secret a
cancer diagnosis in order to ``preserve the peace of mind'' of the
patient. He said most people regard a cancer diagnosis as a death
sentence and it could ``interfere with internal processes'' if the
patient is fully informed.
   Natalia I. Perevodchikova, head of the chemotherapy department
at the All-Union Oncology Center of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Medical
Sciences, agreed with Napalkov and said that Soviet doctors felt
secrecy of diagnosis was the best policy for the patient.
   ``Unless there is an acute necessity, such as a refusal of
treatment, there is no need to tell the patient,'' she said.
   Asked bluntly why American doctors insist on being open with
patients, both Rosenberg and Dr. Vincent T. Devita Jr., director of
the National Cancer Institute, said it was a matter of maintaining
trust between physician and patient.
   The teleconference was to be broadcast to about 1,500 U.S.
hospitals and health care facilities on the Hospital Satellite
Network. The U.S. Information Agency also arranged to carry the
conference on its WORLDNET system to 57 cities in Europe, Africa
and the Middle East. In the Soviet Union, an edited version of the
conference will be broadcast to an estimated 150 million people.

<TEXT>
   Two soldiers who admitted beating and burying
alive four Arabs were sentenced Tuesday to jail terms that were
stiffer than those requested by prosecutors, Israeli radio reported.
   In passing sentence on Pvt. Dror Segen-Cohen and Pvt. Yair
Nissimi, the military court ruled that their conduct was grave and
shameful in the Feb. 5 incident in the village of Kfar Salem, the
radio said.
   The court sentenced Segen-Cohen to six months in jail along with
a four-month suspended sentence; Nissimi received five months in
jail along with a seven-month suspended sentence.
   The soldiers admitted they beat four Arabs from Kfar Salem in
the occupied West Bank to put down a demonstration there, then
buried them in about 25 inches of mud.
   Lt. Aryeh Moscona, the military prosecutor, reached a plea
bargain agreement with the soldiers' lawyers and asked for two
months in jail for Segen-Cohen and 2{ months for Nissimi.
   The court ruled, however, that the soldiers' behavior had
tarnished the army's image and put Israel in a bad light.
   A third soldier, Sgt. Maj. Charlie Danino, is accused of
ordering the burial. He has pleaded innocent and his trial is still
under way.
   Five other soldiers also are on trial for violating military
orders. One has been charged in the killing of a Palestinian in the
Gaza Strip, and four others are accused of beating two Palestinian
detainees after a demonstration in Nablus.

   Two former police officers and the father of one of
them were sentenced Tuesday to federal prison for their roles in a
cocaine-ripoff ring organized by rogue officers.
   Former Officer Felix A. Beruvides, 30, told U.S. District Judge
James W. Kehoe that he had ``disgraced the members of the Miami
Police Department, disgraced the badge I wore and disgraced my
family.''
   Beruvides asked Kehoe to ``give my father probation and give me
any sentence that you would have given him,'' but the judge
rejected the request.
   The younger Beruvides and former Officer Armando Lopez, 26, were
sentenced to 20 years in federal prison on counts of racketeering
and a tax violation.
   Felix C. Beruvides, 59, was sentenced to eight years under a
plea bargain for conspiracy to possess cocaine. He was permitted to
remain free pending a decision by the U.S. Bureau of Prison on
where the term would be served.
   A fourth defendant, former Officer Ricardo Perez, still faces
trial. No date has been set.
   The government charged the officers were involved in the theft
of 147 kilograms of cocaine from a boat on the Miami River on May
31, 1985.
   The father was accused of participating in the theft and earning
$21,500 for guarding 180 pounds of marijuana stolen during a
traffic stop on Oct. 24, 1984.
   The drownings of three drug boat guards and a drug dealer whose
body was found in a box in the field have been linked to the police
ring. None of the three men sentenced Tuesday were charged in the
deaths.
   Other people were charged with civil-rights murder, and those
charges are pending.

   A former Conrail engineer was sentenced today
to the maximum term of five years in prison and fined $1,000 for
causing 16 deaths in Amtrak's worst train accident.
   Rick L. Gates, 33, of Essex, pleaded guilty Feb. 16 to the
single misdemeanor manslaughter count and admitted in a statement
of facts to smoking marijuana on the train and failing to make
several safety checks that might have prevented the accident.
   Baltimore County Circuit Court Judge Joseph P. Murphy said, ``I
didn't think he was under the influence of marijuana.''
   ``But what he did in terms of failure to follow procedures was
to show us that he didn't give a damn. He just didn't care,'' the
judge said.
   Gates and family members in the courtroom wept as prosecutors
read five victim impact statements from relatives of those killed
in the crash.
   In return for the guilty plea, Baltimore County State's Attorney
Sandra O'Connor agreed to consolidate the names of all 16 victims
into one count, which reduced the maximum sentence from 80 years
and $16,000 in fines to five years and a $1,000 fine.
   The plea bargain provoked sharp criticism from families of
victims and leaders of a new safe travel lobby group, Safe Travel
America.
   ``I am grossly disappointed that he can cause tens of millions
of dollars in damage and kill 16 people and still face only five
years on a misdemeanor charge,'' said Dr. Roger Horn, whose
16-year-old daughter Ceres was killed.
   Mrs. O'Connor urged the judge to give Gates the maximum penalty.
   More than 175 people were injured in the Jan. 4, 1987, crash
when Gates missed a track signal and drove three linked Conrail
locomotives in front of the 660-passenger Amtrak train traveling
about 120 mph. The impact trapped riders in the wreckage for hours
in bitter cold weather.
   Gates was unhurt and his brakeman, Edward Cromwell, suffered a
broken leg.
   O'Connor said at the time of the plea that the manslaughter
verdict would ``send a message that transportation workers cannot
work under the kind of negligence that Mr. Gates did.''
   The agreement was announced as jury selection for the Gates'
six-week manslaughter trial was scheduled to begin. Cromwell, who
had been granted immunity from prosecution, was expected to testify
that he and Gates fabricated a story to cover up their drug use on
the train.
   Tests performed on blood samples taken from both men after the
accident showed traces of marijuana and possibly alcohol in their
systems, according to a report by the National Transportation
Safety Board.
   However, defense attorneys said no experts could conclude Gates
was impaired from the marijuana. Lawyers also were expected to cite
a January ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals against
post-crash drug testing.
   Mrs. O'Connor acknowledged that prosecutors had considered the
court ruling in deciding to accept the plea. The ruling has been
appealed to the Supreme Court.

   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart today was
barred from the pulpit for at least a year and ordered not to
appear on his television show for a year in connection with
allegations he hired a prostitute to pose naked.
   The Assemblies of God suspended Swaggart as a minister for two
years, effective immediately, said a church spokeswoman. That means
he cannot preach until he has undergone at least a year of
rehabilitation and may be required to limit his preaching longer,
she said.
   Swaggart was ordered to undergo rehabilitation for two years.
   The Pentecostal church's General Presbytery had the final say on
the fiery preacher's punishment. Its decision was more severe than
the three-month suspension recommended by the Louisiana branch of
the church.
   Gus Weill, a spokesman for Jimmy Swaggart Worldwide Ministries
in Baton Rouge, La., declined immediate comment.
   People approved by the church would supervise Swaggart's
rehabilitation, the Rev. G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendent
of the church, said at a news conference. He provided no other
details about the sanctions.
   The rehabilitation period would begin when Swaggart agreed to
the terms in writing. He has 30 days to respond.
   Carlson said he had notified Swaggart of the decision.
   ``He thanked me,'' Carlson said. ``He expressed thanks, and I
had prayer with him over the telephone.''
   A member of the General Presbytery, H. Maurice Lednicky, said
most of the discussion in its two-day meeting was over the power of
the 13-member Executive Presbytery to impose punishment.
   The Louisiana District had imposed a three-month suspension from
the pulpit for Swaggart and had refused to reconsider that on
request of the Executive Presbytery, which sought a stiffer
penalty. The executive board noted that every other Assemblies of
God minister who has confessed to moral failure has been barred
from the pulpit for at least a year, officials said.
   At the meeting, it was agreed that the Executive Presbytery had
constitutional authority in the case, and the punishment given
Swaggart was the same that the Executive Presbytery had originally
recommended, said Lednicky, president of the Assemblies of God
Central Bible College in Springfield.
   The 206 presbyters present from the 232-member body reconvened
at 9 a.m. after working late Monday and ended their meeting two
hours later.
   ``This is not a meeting to determine the guilt or innocence of
Jimmy Swaggart; he has already confessed,'' church spokeswoman
Juleen Turnage said earlier. ``They are here to make a decision on
what will be done with his credentials.''
   The Assemblies of God, the nation's largest Pentecostal
denomination, is headquartered in Springfield.
   Swaggart tearfully stepped down from his Baton Rouge, La.,
pulpit Feb. 21, admitting unspecified sins. Published reports have
said he paid a prostitute to pose naked.
   Debra Murphree, who says she is the woman who posed, will appear
in the July issue of Penthouse magazine, a spokeswoman for the
publication said Monday.
   ``From what I understand, the photographs will recreate the
precise poses and actions that Jimmy Swaggart paid for,'' Leslie
Jay, vice president and director of public relations for Penthouse,
said in a telephone interview from her New York office.
   Jay said she had not seen the pictures or an interview with
Murphree. She said she didn't know how much Murphree was paid.
   The General Presbytery was directed by the Executive Presbytery
on March 3 to take up the Swaggart case.
   Three representatives of the Louisiana district attended
Monday's meeting, which was chaired by Carlson.
   Mrs. Turnage said Carlson briefed the presbyters on Swaggart's
transgession and the presbyters were given documentation. No
witnesses were called and Swaggart did not appear.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia has requested that
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky of Austria postpone a visit to Prague,
and there were reports Tuesday that a government shakeup was
planned.
   There have been rumors that Premier Lubomir Strougal, a leading
advocate of reform in Czechoslovakia, is on his way out.
   Vranitzky told Austrian journalists Monday that the Czechoslovak
leadership had asked him to postpone a visit set for April 17-20.
The Austrian Press Agency reported the reason given for the
postponement was a planned government shuffle in Prague.
   The Czechoslovak government spokesman told journalists in Prague
that a bill would be presented at a National Assembly meeting April
19 for the abolition of some ministries by merging them with others.
   However, the Austria Press Agency quoted sources close to
Vranitzky as saying that Austria's charge d'affaires in Prague was
called to the Czechoslovak premier's office Monday.
   The news agency said an official in Strougal's office asked that
the visit be postponed because the country was in a ``delicate
situation'' in view of pending government changes.
   It quoted the sources as saying the Czechoslovak leadership did
not want Vrantizky to have to meet with negotiating partners when
``we don't know how long they will remain in the government.''
   There have been increasing rumours that Strougal was on his way
out since Gustav Husak stepped down as Communist Party chief in
December and was replaced by Milos Jakes. Husak retained the
presidency.
   Jakes is not seen as a reformer likely to initiate the kind of
economic and politial reforms now being enacted in the Soviet
Union, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria.

<TEXT>
   States seeking to cope with rising prison
costs may not seize Social Security benefits received by inmates,
the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
   The court unanimously struck down an Arkansas law that permitted
authorities to use an inmate's Social Security benefits for state
purposes.
   Similar laws have been enacted in Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and
Tennessee, the justices had been told.
   The Arkansas law allowed seizure of Veterans Administration
benefits as well. Although the court's decision did not discuss VA
benefits, its rationale appeared to bar seizure of those federal
payments as well.
   The justices, in an unsigned opinion, said federal law
``unambiguously rules out any attempt to attach Social Security
benefits.''
   Noting that the Arkansas law allows such attachment, the court
said, ``This amounts to a conflict ... that the state cannot win.''
   Federal laws creating the Social Security and Veterans
Administration programs bar any legal action aimed at diverting
benefits from the designated recipients.
   The court rejected arguments by Arkansas officials that the
federal laws do not apply to seizures of prison inmates' benefits
because the inmates are being provided with ``care and
maintenance.''
   The impact of Tuesday's ruling has been blunted somewhat by laws
passed by Congress in 1980 and 1983 withholding or limiting
benefits otherwise due imprisoned felons.
   The decision also does not affect state laws that require prison
inmates to reimburse the state _ from sources other than federal
benefits _ for some of the costs of their incarceration.
   For example, the justices were told that six states require jail
inmates serving terms for misdemeanors to make such reimbursements.
Those states are Alabama, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska
and North Carolina.
   The justices were told that eight states require reimbursement
by inmates for certain kinds of state claims _ ranging from medical
expenses to expenses incurred by quelling riots. Those states are
Arizona, Florida, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, North
Dakota and Rhode Island.
   The Arkansas Legislature in 1981 passed the state's Inmate Care
and Custody Reimbursement Act. Under it, state authorities may seek
court approval to seize an inmate's estate _ income from any source.
   Former inmate George Bennett challenged the law. He was serving
11 years of a 21-year sentence at a Pine Bluff prison for
second-degree murder when he turned 62.
   Bennett started receiving $275 a month in Social Security
retirement benefits, but those payments were confiscated by state
officials. He was released from prison in late 1984 but is seeking
to recover $3,600 in seized benefits.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled against him, but Tuesday's
ruling reversed the state court's decision.
   Reagan administration lawyers had opposed the Arkansas law,
telling the justices that such legislation ``would seem to validate
the attachment of Social Security and VA benefits paid to persons
confined in state mental hospitals or in other institutions where
they are provided care by the state.''

<TEXT>
   The father of a young woman identified as
the agent who lured Israeli nuclear dissident Mordechai Vanunu to
his capture says he was startled to hear of his daughter's alleged
espionage activities.
   ``Of course I was shocked,'' said Stanley Hanin. ``Could you
picture your daughter involved in anything like this?''
   Hanin, owner of the Allied Discount Tires chain, spoke to
reporters Monday after viewing a television program Sunday that
described Cheryl Hanin Bentov's alleged role in the capture of
Vanunu, who disclosed details of Israel's nuclear weapons program
to a British newspaper in 1986.
   ``This is the first I've heard of anything like this,'' said
Hanin. ``I find this totally unbelievable.''
   Days after The Sunday Times published Vanunu's revelations, he
disappeared from a London hotel where he had been living under an
assumed name and later surfaced in an Israeli jail. Vanunu was
tried in secret in Israel and sentenced Sunday to 18 years in
prison for treason.
   Vanunu's brother Meir, who lives in London, has claimed that
Israeli secret service agents used a woman named ``Cindy'' to lure
his brother to Rome with the promise of sex. He says agents
captured and drugged his brother there and spirited him to Israel
for trial.
   The CBS program ``60 Minutes'' Sunday identified ``Cindy'' as
Mrs. Bentov, an agent of the Israeli secret service Mossad and wife
of Ofer Bentov, a major in Israeli military intelligence.
   Hanin said his daughter moved to Israel 10 years ago at age 17
after studying there in a student exchange program. He said they
are not close and he has not heard from her ``for some time,'' and
that he doesn't know where she lives.
   ``I would be concerned for her safety if I thought there was a
shred of truth to this,'' Hanin said. ``But I don't think there's a
speck of truth to it.''
   Lowell Boggs, assistant principal at Edgewater High School,
where Cheryl Hanin went to school, said she was a good student who
spent the final semester of her senior year studying in Israel for
about five months.
   Boggs said that over the past 1{ years, the school has been
visited by two private detectives who asked to see her yearbook
picture, a reporter from London and another from Miami asking about
her, and, last spring, a man with credentials showing him to be
from the CIA.
   Edgewater Principal Charles Rohrer said the FBI also came by the
school to ``go through her records three or four times.''

<DATELINE>EDGEWATER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 21-year-old woman near delivery with
her first child ended up jailed and in handcuffs instead of in a
hospital, all over a traffic violation.
   Kimberly Taylor was arrested at her home at 5:20 a.m. Saturday
because she had failed to appear in court March 18 on the traffic
charge.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Mrs. Taylor said Monday, after a
visit to her doctor, who said the baby could arrive any time. ``It
was so stupid. You'd think they'd have better things to do than
bother me on a Saturday morning.''
   Mrs. Taylor said her doctor told her the stress from the
incident with the police may be prolonging her labor. She said the
sac of water surrounding the baby broke Saturday about an hour
before she was arrested.
   Police said officer Brad Maerz was near the end of his shift
Saturday when he knocked on the Taylors' door, told her to get
dressed and took her to the police station.
   Mrs. Taylor said she was in a holding cell when she overheard
Maerz tell another officer he made the arrest because ``I was
bored.''
   Police Chief Henry Smith said the Taylors had filed a complaint.
   ``There will be an internal investigation to look at the
circumstances and determine whether good judgment was used in the
matter,'' Smith said. ``We'll look at any possible violation of
procedure.''
   Smith said Mrs. Taylor was arrested on a bench warrant from
Jefferson County Court for failure to appear at a hearing. She was
cited Jan. 21 for driving a car with expired license plates and not
having a valid driver's license.
   Mrs. Taylor said that when she was taken from the police
department to the county jail, ``they didn't want anything to do
with a woman whose contractions were coming about 15 minutes
apart.''
   As she was being released from the county jail, she said she was
taken from her cell to the release area in handcuffs.
   Mrs. Taylor's husband, Paul, said his wife just didn't have her
driver's license with her that day.
   As for the expired plates, ``We had just bought that car, and we
were waiting for the title to get new plates,'' he said. ``We have
that all taken care of now, but we forgot about the court date
because we've been dealing with complications with the pregnancy
for the last month. We've been worried about that, and we spaced
out the court date. But we think the whole thing has been handled
unfairly and unprofessionally.''

<TEXT>
   The case of a 4-year-old boy adopted in two
states by sets of warring relatives after his father killed his
mother came nearer resolution Tuesday when the Indiana Court of
Appeals upheld the voiding of the adoption here.
   The court unanimously affirmed an April 1987 Grant County
Circuit Court decision invalidating the adoption of Phillip Taylor
by his paternal grandparents, Everett L. and Jean K. Taylor, of
Marion.
   The boy has since been adopted by Celeste Benigno White, sister
of the boy's mother, and her husband, Jefferson White, of the New
York City borough of Staten Island.
   A legal fight over the child followed the Nov. 11, 1984, murder
of his mother, Teresa Benigno Taylor, in New Jersey. Her husband,
Dr. Kenneth Taylor, was convicted in 1985 of first-degree murder
and sentenced to life imprisonment.
   After the murder, a New Jersey court granted joint custody of
the child to the Whites and the Taylors with the Taylors to have
custody in July and August and during the week after Christmas each
year. The Whites were to keep the child the rest of the year.
   In late 1985, the Whites filed a custody petition in New York,
and in January 1986, the Taylors filed an adoption petition in
Grant County. The Taylors had earlier filed an adoption petition
that wasn't acted on in New Jersey.
   As part of their Indiana petition, the Taylors filed Kenneth
Taylor's consent to the adoption. However, according to court
records, the Whites weren't notified of the proceeding, and the
petition didn't mention that the boy's father had been convicted of
murder or that a New Jersey court had acted on the child's custody.
   During a visit to Indiana in August 1986, Phillip was formally
adopted by the Taylors. In a telephone call to Mrs. White, Mrs.
Taylor said that ``the Taylors had adopted Phillip and that the
Whites would never see him again,'' court records said.
   The Whites challenged the adoption by arguing that their consent
and that of the New Jersey court was required.
   The Taylors contended that because they had the consent of their
son, Phillip's only living parent, they needed no one else's
consent.
   The lower court held and the appeals panel confirmed Tuesday
that consent of all parties involved _ including the other court
and custodial parents _ must be obtained before Indiana law permits
an adoption.
   ``A decree of adoption may be entered only if the required
consents were obtained,'' Judge William Garrard wrote for the
court. ``As the Taylors failed to obtain all the required consents,
the judgment of the adoption was voidable.''
   The Taylors have not said whether they will appeal Tuesday's
ruling to the Indiana Supreme Court.

<HEAD>West Virginia University Forms Committee To Study Possible
Conflicts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West Virginia University administrators
set up a committee Tuesday to explore the ethical obligations of
students who do ``corporate espionage'' for companies under the
auspices of the university.
   The announcement, made by Frank Franz, vice president for
academic affairs, comes one week after the Wall Street Journal
reported that graduate students in the business school divulged
sales and inventory figures gained in a study to competitors of the
businesses they surveyed.
   ``The article points out that the confidentiality of respondents
was promised but not observed,'' Franz said.
   ``The key problem is that the students were put in a very
unfortunate position by the sponsors of the project and I think
inappropriate things were asked of them.''
   Franz said the seven-member committee will consider whether
students should be required to disclose routinely the sponsor of a
study, its purpose and who will receive the information obtained.
   He said the committee also will suggest ways to avoid conflicts
of interest in internships, research projects and other
opportunities that arise through consulting performed by faculty
members for private companies.
   The Journal reported that two groups of students who conducted
competitive analyses for two Caterpillar heavy-equipment dealers
were asked by the dealers to identify the competitors they
interviewed.
   Several students said they did. One of those involved likened
the work to ``spying.''
   Representatives of two of the dealerships interviewed for the
1987 study said they would not have given out the information if
they had known the students were working for other dealers.
   ``I feel the way they went about it was very underhanded,'' Gary
Clark, executive vice president of Clark Co., one of the companies
in the study, told the Daily Anthenaeum, the student newspaper.
   ``Now I will probably be on my guard whenever I talk to
students. But I don't blame the students. I blame the professor.''
   Terry Wilson, professor of the Marketing 321 class, told the
Journal that the students ``should not have divulged confidential
information to their clients.''
   Franz said there is no evidence that Wilson, who is a consultant
for Caterpillar, encouraged the students to give the information to
the dealerships.
   Wilson, who is on a yearlong sabbatical from the university, did
not return telephone messages left with his office.

<HEAD>Palestinian Says PLO Okayed Meeting With Shultz</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PLO lifted its ban on a meeting between
Arabs from the occupied territories and U.S. Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, a Palestinian said Tuesday.
   U.S. officials said they hoped such a session, expected to take
place next week in Jerusalem, would help breathe life into a U.S.
peace proposal for the region.
   The shift in policy came after Shultz met three days ago with
two Palestinian-Americans linked to the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   ``That meeting was great. It was a big step forward and paved
the way for us to meet with Shultz next week,'' said Said Kenaan, a
prominent Nablus businessman.
   The PLO issued two declarations this week, one via a PLO
representative in Cairo and the other from its headquarters in
Tunis, approving Palestinian attendance at a meeting with Shultz
next week, Kenaan said.
   But Kenaan said Arabs from east Jerusalem and the occupied
territories would not attend the Jerusalem meeting unless the PLO
approval was well- publicized and PLO chief Yasser Arafat came out
publicly behind it.
   ``Otherwise we fear for our lives,'' he told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.
   Shultz is to arrive in Jerusalem on Sunday and also will visit
Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
   ``We want a chance to discuss our grievances, and to tell him
the PLO must be a party to peace talks on equal footing with all
other parties,'' Kenaan said.
   When Shultz visited the region in February, Palestinians from
the territories heeded a call from the PLO and refused to meet him.
The refusal was viewed by American officials as a setback for U.S.
peace proposals.
   The climate has changed because of Shultz's meeting Saturday
with Edward Said, a Columbia University professor, and Ibrahim Abu
Lughud of Northwestern University.
   Both men are members of the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's self-described legislative body.
   Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
denounced the talks as a violation of a U.S. commitment not to meet
with the PLO.
   But other officials close to U.S. efforts to start negotiations
in the region said the meeting was intended to pave the way for
further involvement of the Palestinians in the peace process.
   ``Shultz has always viewed Palestinian participation as very
important,'' one U.S. official said privately. ``It was hoped that
this move would improve chances for that involvement and thus for
the success of the U.S. peace plan.''
   In Tripoli, Libya, hardline Palestinian leader George Habash
urged Palestinians to boycott the Shultz peace mission.
   ``I call upon the revolutionary leadership and PLO leadership to
boycott the Shultz visit as they did the first time,'' said Habash,
leader of the Marxist, Syrian-backed Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, which is affiliated with the PLO.
   ``If the American administration is sincere in finding a just
solution for the Middle East it must recognize the PLO as the sole
legitimate representative of Palestinian people ... it must
recognize legitimate rights of Palestinian people, that is
self-determination and an independent Palestinian state and reject
the nation that we're a second class people,'' he told a news
conference.

<HEAD>Women's Enrollment Up Sharply In Health Profession Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proportion of women enrolled in schools
for health professions has skyrocketed in recent years, according
to a federal statistical analysis issued Tuesday.
   The most striking increase was in dental schools, where women
made up only 1 percent of enrollment in the 1971-72 school term. By
the 1985-86 term, the figure was 25 percent.
   Enrollment of women in medical schools jumped from 11 percent to
33 percent over the same period, and in pharmacy schools from 24
percent to 56 percent.
   Those are among figures contained in the 207-page ``Health
United States 1987,'' a report issued annually by the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   Most of the figures were released previously as they were being
compiled by one or more of the dozens of agencies within HHS, and
tend to lag a year or two behind the volume's publication.
   The National Center for Health Statistics, an arm of the Centers
for Disease Control, organizes the material into an annual report _
as required by law _ to provide a central storehouse of statistical
data.
   The 1987 volume documents that life expectancy at birth has
increased dramatically since 1900 for all Americans, regardless of
race or sex.
   For example, a black female born in 1900 could expect to live
only 33.5 years compared with 62.7 years for one born in 1950 and
73.5 years for one born in 1985.
   Although there have been life expectacy gains across the board,
the smallest increase _ 25 years _ was among white males. A white
male born in 1900 could expect to live 46.6 years compared with
71.9 years for one born in 1985.
   Some other highlights:
   _Infant mortality declined only 2 percent between 1984 and 1985,
the smallest drop since 1965. The black infant mortality rate, 18.2
per 1,000 live births, is almost twice as high as for white
infants, 9.3 per 1,000.
   _Births to unmarried mothers doubled between 1970 and 1985, from
11 percent to 22 percent.
   _Between 1970 and 1985, mortality from cancer, the second
leading cause of death, increased slightly overall. However, lung
cancer deaths among women more than doubled. Heart disease remains
the No. 1 killer.

   Republican Sen. Bob Dole quit the presidential race today, three
weeks after being buried in George Bush's Super Tuesday landslide,
calling himself ``bloodied but unbowed, as the poet says.'' On the
Democratic side, Michael Dukakis sought a Connecticut primary
victory to slow Jesse Jackson.
   Dole offered his congratulations to Bush, who beat him in a
solid majority of primaries and said, ``Keeping the White House
Republican, that's the bottom line.''
   Flanked by his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, and his daughter Robin, Dole said, ``I know, and my family
knows, that I'm a fighter, and I don't like to lose.''
   ``I've been beaten before and no doubt will again. But I have
never been defeated and never will be,'' the Kansas senator said,
as supporters and fellow senators applauded.
   White House Chief of Staff Howard H. Baker Jr., a former
presidential hopeful himself as well as a former Senate colleague
of Dole's, said he'd talked to Dole earlier, and ``I told him I've
been there. I know how it feels. I told him there'll be life after
this, political life, that he has a major role to play.''
   Among the Democrats, Rep. Richard Gephardt filed for re-election
to his House seat one day after dropping his own presidential bid.
He told reporters in Jefferson City, Mo., ``I am very happy to be
here.''
   After updating based on final Michigan results and a
redistribution of some of Gephardt's delegates, Dukakis held a slim
seven-delegate lead over Jackson. The Massachusetts governor hoped
to add to his lead today with a win in neighboring Connecticut.
   In New York meanwhile, Sen. Albert Gore Jr., took a few apparent
swipes at Jackson, an ordained minister known for his ringing
speeches.
   In remarks to the Association for a Better New York, Gore was
applauded when he said that in the campaign, ``we're not choosing a
preacher, we're choosing a president.''
   ``The Oval Office is a whole lot more than a pulpit,'' Gore said.
   Referring to Jackson's calling himself ``a tree shaker, not a
jelly maker,'' Gore asserted that ``in the Oval Office, some jelly
must be made. Only a president who knows how big government works
can turn soaring rhetoric and lofty goals into programs and
policies.''
   Among the Republicans, even with Dole nominally still in the
race, Bush was overwhelmingly favored today in his almost-home
state of Connecticut. But he said he didn't want to ``project an
arrogance.''
   Dukakis was also expected to do well in the primary, with 52
delegates at stake. But Jackson has been drawing big, enthusiastic
crowds in the state.
   ``There's nothing more powerful in the world than the people
whose hope has been raised,'' he said as he stumped in Connecticut
on Monday.
   Jackson's stunning weekend win in Michigan's caucuses put
Dukakis under mounting pressure. Connecticut's Democratic state
chairman, John F. Droney, said that in light of Jacson's gains,
Dukakis had to poll better than 50 percent in the primary to
reassert himself.
   Dukakis disputed whether he had to land such a knockout punch
just to stay in the ring. ``Look _ a victory is a victory,'' he
said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, was drawing admiring comment from both sides
of the political aisle on Monday. Bush, campaigning in Wisconsin,
which holds its primary a week from today, went out of his way to
praise him.
   ``The man's racking up delegates, and that's how you get
elected,'' the vice president said. ``What he has done is very
admirable.''
   Bush's comments came at a news conference in Milwaukee, where he
picked up the endorsement of Rep. Jack Kemp, a former rival. Kemp,
who quit the presidential race earlier this month, said he would
actively campaign for the vice president.
   Gephardt also praised Jackson as he was closing the book on his
own Democratic candidacy. He refrained from making any formal
endorsement, but said: ``I believe Jesse Jackson can be nominated
and I think he can be elected.''
   Gephardt, whose campaign slid downhill after an initial win in
Iowa's Democratic caucuses, said he was hampered by a lack of
funds. But he added: ``I have no alibis. We lost, no question about
that.''
   Gephardt's loss was his rivals' gain. Most of his 167 delegates
went into the uncommitted column, but Missouri state party rules
mandate that the at-large and public official delegates are
re-divided among the active candidates when a contender drops out.
   According to the latest AP count, Dukakis had 611.55, Jackson
604.55, Tennessee Sen. Gore 364.8, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon 169.5
and uncommitted 508.6.
   Jackson, who leads in the popular vote totals, said he expects
to emerge as the Democratic nominee if he wins the most
pre-convention delegates.
   Appearing on ABC's ``Nightline'' on Monday night, he said if he
were the leader going into the convention, he did not expect that
party leaders would use the votes of ``super delegates'' _ elected
officials and party professionals _ to keep him from getting the
nomination.
   ``If they used their power in that way, it would be unwise. It
would not be right,'' he said.
   On the Republican side, Bush was far, far ahead of either Dole
or former television evangelist Pat Robertson, with 778 delegates
to Dole's 178 and Robertson's 17.
   Even so, Bush said he didn't want to get overconfident.
   ``One of the best things that happened to me was getting my
brains kicked out in Iowa,'' he said. ``Everybody had me dead and
buried. We were resurrected ... So people say now things are going
pretty well for you, and they are.''

<HEAD>Shuttle Customers May be Charged $245 Million Per Flight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering charging space
shuttle customers up to $245 million a flight for carrying their
cargo into space, a congressional panel was told Tuesday.
   Up to now, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has
charged $87 million maximum for use of the cargo bay, billed to
users according to how much space they used.
   Dale Myers, NASA's deputy administrator, confirmed that the $245
million figure was discussed last week by a panel connected to the
Senior Interagency Group for space, a top-level advisory committee
for the president.
   ``That is not the final decision,'' Myers told Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., at a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing
on NASA's fiscal 1989 budget request. He did not dispute Proxmire's
contention that NASA lost an 8-1 vote for the $245 million figure
in the interagency group.
   The total cost of a shuttle flight has varied, according to the
frequency of flights within a given fiscal year. A 1985 estimate _
a year before the Challenger disaster _ priced each flight at $150
million, at a rate of 14 launches a year.
   NASA has never pressed for full recovery of its costs. In the
first flights of the shuttle, beginning in 1981, the cost for
launching a satellite from the cargo bay was about $10 million.
   The agency then instituted a pricing policy of $71 million for a
full cargo bay, meaning that a satellite owner might pay $23
million-plus if his cargo was launched along with two other
satellites. The charge per cargo bay rose to $87 million per flight
in October 1985.
   Myers explained during the hearing and afterward that the $245
million was `'sort of an upper limit of all the costs.''
   ``It's an estimate that includes everything including the
kitchen sink, all the overhead, manpower required for checkout, all
the hardware, all the fuels, all the contingencies that might occur
due to delays in flights,'' he said.
   But asked if that were the amount the space agency would seek to
recover from cargo bay users, Myers said: ``No, it is not in our
view a number that would make any sense at all. I can't really talk
too much about it, because this is internal planning.''
   A staff member of the appropriations subcommittee called the
$245 million ``a non-subsidized, real-world total number for a
flight on the shuttle, if you want to buy it.''
   The Senior Interagency Group for space includes representatives
of NASA, the CIA and the Commerce, Transportation, Defense and
State departments.

   The Soviet Union stops or delays mail to put
pressure on dissidents, former Moscow activist Vladimir Slepak told
a congressional subcommittee Tuesday.
   ``The goal of the Soviet authorities is to isolate people from
any contact with the outside world. This is an effort to break our
spirit and determination,'' Slepak said.
   Telephones, mail and telegrams are all cut off or interfered
with, Slepak told the House Post Office and Civil Service
subcommittee on postal operations. The subcommittee is
investigating complaints of returned and undelivered mail sent to
the Soviet Union.
   ``The problem is not the bad work of the Soviet post office. It
is because of the order of the KGB or other authorities,'' said
Slepak.
   He cited his five years in exile in Siberia, when he regularly
received mail from other countries. Upon his return to Moscow in
1982, mail was cut off, he said.
   Slepak was allowed to leave the Soviet Union last year following
a pair of hunger strikes by himself in Moscow and his son in
Washington.
   Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., noted that the subcommittee
first started looking into the problem in 1977.
   With better international relations there may be hope for
improvement, Gilman said, but ``we must not be lulled into
believing that the problem has been or is close to being resolved.''
   Assistant Postmaster General William T. Johnstone said in
prepared testimony that the rate of returned parcels has declined
in the past year. Yet, he added, ``while fewer parcels apparently
are being returned, the practice remains a troublesome one.''
   The Soviet Union has a long and complex list of unacceptable
goods, Johnstone said.
   Another problem exists with registered mail, which many people
use because the item must be signed for, he added.
   Unlike the United States, where the person receiving the mail
must sign, Soviet policy is for a postal official to sign the
receipt, Johnstone said.
   ``We plan to exert every effort to try to persuade the Soviet
Union to change its policy,'' he said.
   One new problem will be arising shortly, Johnstone added.
   Starting May 1, the Soviet Union will require customs
declarations on parcels to be written in either French or Russian.
   It is common practice to require declarations in either French
or the language of the receiving country, he said. But in the past
the Soviets have made exceptions to allow English.
   They announced the change to only French or Russian early in
1987, but postponed implementation twice to accommodate the United
States, Johnstone said.

saying, ``You come to trust your instincts to tell you it's over.''
   ``I'm a fighter and I don't like to lose,'' Dole said,
surrounded by House and Senate colleagues. ``I make no apology for
that. It's simply the way I am.''
   But he said he also was an optimist. ``I've been beaten before
and no doubt will again. But I've never been defeated and never
will be.''
   Dole, who has been without a primary win for more than a month,
tipped his hat to Bush.
   ``The one thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business
is to count. You come to trust your instincts to tell you it's
over. In my heart I know that time is now. I congratulate George
Bush and wish him well in November,'' the Kansas senator said.
   Dole's remarks showed none of the bitterness that has
characterized his attitude toward Bush in the past. When Dole took
the microphone, he cracked, ``We're not going to say anything mean
about anybody.''
   Dole, whose last weeks as a candidate were marked by bruising
defeats at the hands of Bush, said he looked forward to his return
to the Senate and his duties as minority leader.
   ``I return to the Senate as the Republican leader eager to
engage the issues that confront America ... doing all I can for our
nominee, George Bush,'' he said.
   Dole recalled his official entry to the race on Nov. 9.
   ``Nearly five months ago I went home to Russell, Kan., to
declare my candidacy for the highest office the American people can
bestow. It was only natural I should begin my campaign on Main
Street, among those from whom I have always drawn my strength and
my identity. Today here I am, bloodied and unbowed, as the poet
said,'' he said.
   Dole sent one message to Bush, the inevitable GOP nominee:
   ``My campaign has been an appeal for all Republicans to
recognize and celebrate the diversity of America. No party can
govern that is not truly representative of this nation of nations.''
   The Senate minority leader made a fast start out of the gate,
overwhelming the vice president in the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8. But he
stumbled a week later in New Hampshire's primary. Dole rebounded
with a pair of wins in South Dakota and Minnesota on Feb. 23, but
Bush stunned the Republican field with a 16-state primary sweep on
Super Tuesday.
   Dole never recovered. Though he made an effort to revive his
campaign in Illinois, he lost heavily there and appeared to be
merely going through the motions after that.
   Dole campaigned last week in Wisconsin, where he hoped to make a
comeback, but public opinion polls indicated a 2-to-1 Bush lead. By
week's end, Dole told a Washington audience that he thought Bush's
nomination was ``a foregone conclusion.''
   ``I can read the numbers and I probably know what's happening,''
he said.
   ``We need to keep a Republican in the White House. That's where
I'm coming from,'' he said. ``And if it can't be me, it will be
George Bush.''
   On Monday, he delivered a speech that stopped short of a
withdrawal but looked and sounded like a last hurrah. Joined by his
wife, Elizabeth, and daughter, Robin, he said he wanted to thank
his campaign workers and outline his vision for the future of the
GOP.
   Dole's second campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination _ the first, in 1980, also ended in failure _ was flawed
all along by internal disarray. The Senate leader was not inclined
to delegate authority. He finally brought on former Labor Secretary
Bill Brock last November to run the campaign. But it may have been
too late.
   Bush's well-oiled campaign machinery had been in place for
years, and Dole struggled uphill against a rival who ran as a
front-runner and made few mistakes.
   Dole tried repeatedly to stir voters into resentment against
Bush and his upper-class background, but Dole's argument that he
was ``one of us'' apparently won over only Iowans. Dole also lashed
out often at Bush for his still-murky role in the Iran-Contra
arms-for-hostages affair, but Republican primary voters didn't buy
it.
   Bush also had a trump card that he played often _ Ronald Reagan.
Bush ran successfully as the loyal vice president to one of the
most popular presidents in modern history.
   ``I'm sort of running against the ghost of Ronald Reagan,'' Dole
said recently.

   Surrogate mother Mary Beth
Whitehead-Gould testified Tuesday that both sides in the Baby M
case should put aside their bitterness and let the child grow up
knowing her birth mother.
   ``Life is too short,'' said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould in the second
day of a visitation hearing. ``I don't know what life is going to
bring. But there's a chance that she will never know me, that I'd
never know her.''
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, 31, visibly pregnant in a blue and white
maternity dress, spoke calmly and quietly in 2{ hours of testimony.
Her voice sometimes wavered, but she did did not cry.
   The child's father, William Stern, and his wife Elizabeth, sat
grim-faced through much of the testimony. Mrs. Stern smiled
occasionally, however, when Mrs. Whitehead-Gould spoke of the
mannerisms of the 2-year-old girl legally known as Melissa Stern.
   The Sterns, who have custody of Melissa at their home in
Tenafly, in their testimony called Mrs. Whitehead-Gould a liar who
could undermine their relationship with the child and possibly
exploit the girl in the media.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, of East Brunswick, is seeking more liberal
visitation with Melissa. She wants to see the child two days a week
for a total of 16 hours at her home immediately, with the schedule
eventually expanded to include overnight stays, half the summer and
some holidays.
   The Sterns are seeking to have visitation cut off for several
years, perhaps until the child is 9 or 10.
   The hearing before Superior Court Judge Birger M. Sween was
ordered by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which on Feb. 13 restored
Mrs. Whiehead-Gould's parental rights but left intact a ruling that
gave custody to the Sterns.
   Stern, a biochemist, and Mrs. Stern, a pediatrician, have said
they turned to surrogacy because Mrs. Stern feared that her age and
her mild form of multiple sclerosis would make pregnancy dangerous.
Mrs. Stern is now 42.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould agreed to bear them a child for $10,000 by
being artificially inseminated with Stern's sperm. But when the
baby was born, she changed her mind, sparking the dispute.
   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who has remarried and is pregnant with her
current husband's child, asked for reconciliation with the Sterns
in the emotional tug-of-war over the child.
   ``I'm willing to meet them more than half way,'' she said.
   Much of Mrs. Whitehead-Gould's testimony answered charges made
by the Sterns.
   She said she felt no anger toward the Sterns and did not blame
them, as Stern said Monday, for the breakup of her 14-year marriage
to Richard Whitehead.
   ``I let go of custody a long time ago,'' she said. ``I want to
be a mother. I want to share in raising her in any way I can. But I
don't want to undermine the Sterns in any way.''
   She said that her current visitation schedule of two hours a
week under supervision wasn't ``meaningful.'' Mrs. Whitehead-Gould
said the child could benefit by contact with her new husband, New
York City tax accountant Dean Gould, and her two children from her
previous marriage, Ryan, 13, and Tuesday, 12.

   Floodwaters swept away two people as
they cried for help from their submerged van Tuesday and thousands
along the swollen Danube River prepared to flee amid warnings more
dikes could break.
   The latest apparent drownings brought to six the number of dead
in Bavaria's worst flooding in 70 years.
   The Rhine River on Tuesday crested inches short of the top of a
flood wall protecting Cologne's historic Old Town. The Danube,
Mosel, and other major rivers already were receding, but
forecasters predicted more flood-threatening rain through Easter
weekend.
   Rescue workers were searching Tuesday for the Volkswagen van
with two people that witnesses said was swept away by the Main
river in the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg, where riverside streets
were flooded.
   Witnesses reported seeing the vehicle's headlights in the
floodwaters and hearing cries for help. But the van was gone by the
time rescuers arrived in boats.
   The Danube River has burst through dikes in several places since
Sunday, forcing 3,500 people to evacuate.
   Officials, meanwhile, worried about forecasts for more rain.
``We're not giving the all-clear signal yet,'' said Ruediger
Beiser, an official with the Office for Water and River Transport
in Mainz.
   Rhine floodwater covered nearby sidewalks and some streets in
Bonn, the federal capital. Residents of large villas lining the
river in the Bonn district, which house many embassies, were
preparing sandbags and using pumps to dry out their flooded cellars.
   In a section of Cologne's Old Town area, residents spent the
night building mortar-and-brick walls around their homes, clearing
out their basements, and placing elevated planks on their sidewalks.
   The Rhine rose to 32.3 feet at about 3 a.m. and stayed there,
dramtically stopping just short of the top of a 32{-foot flood wall.
   All the same, some water had seaped through the barrier and was
being pumped out of cellars.
   ``Unfortunately, the wall is not totally watertight,'' said
Eckehard Link, head of anti-flooding efforts for Cologne, a city of
1 million people.

<HEAD>Justice Minister Resigns Amid Drug-Corruption Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The justice minister has resigned
after a former policeman said the minister headed a secret
anti-narcotics police that sold confiscated drugs and weapons.
   Minister Jose Manzo Gonzalez's resignation was effective Monday.
He had been justice minister since 1984.
   He was replaced Tuesday by Pedro Torres Agudo, former head of
the Technical Judicial Police, Venezuela's principal investigative
police corps.
   The newspaper, El Universal, reported Tuesday that Gonzalez
resigned to aid a police investigation and to take legal action
against people who allegedly injured his prestige.
   Manzo's resignation came on the same day as the resignation of
his counterpart in Colombia, Alfredo Gutierrez Marquez. Gutierrez
stepped down after reports that an airstrip at his brother's ranch
was used by drug runners linked to Colombia Medellin cartel.
   The cartel smuggles most of the cocaine reaching the United
States, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says.
   In a videotape played two weeks ago before the Investigations
Committee of the Venezuelan Congress, former police Roberto Eduardo
Dipucci Ponti said Manzo set up a secret police unit to infiltrate
narcotics rings in Venezuela.
   Dipucci Ponti said the unit captured drugs and weapons from
narcotics traffickers and then resold them.
   The former officer said he was a member of the secret force and
that he made the videotape because he feared for his life. Dipucci
reportedly is in hiding in Venezuela.
   The president of the Investigations Committee, Paciano Padron,
called for Manzo's removal after initial investigations indicated
the existence of the secret unit and irregularities in its
activities.
   The committee began its investigations in February after a
leftist politician claimed Venezuela's political parties were
financing their presidential campaigns with drug money.
   Padron also maintained the police unit itself was illegal since
it depended directly on Manzo rather than one of the official
Venezuelan security forces.
   Manzo has said that the secret force existed between 1982 and
1986 but claimed it was a military agency.
   Defense Minister Eliodoro Guerrero Gomez has denied the unit
ever operated within the military.

   The military said its troops stormed
a capital suburb Tuesday and captured six communist guerrillas,
including three top leaders, as rebels marked the anniversary of
their struggle.
   Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa hailed the arrests in the
Manila suburb of San Juan as ``a big loss'' to the communists. He
said those captured were ``very high-ranking personalities who have
been the subject of many manhunts and many operations in the past.''
   Troops in Manila and five other regions had been placed on
heightened alert in anticipation of rebel attacks on the
anniversary of the 24,000-member New People's Army, a communist
group that began fighting the government 19 years ago.
   The top leaders were identified as Rafael Baylosis, secretary
general of the Communist Party of the Philippines; Benjamin de
Vera, a party central committee member; and New People's Army Chief
of Staff Napoleon Manuel. A military report says de Vera also heads
the party's commission in charge of operations on Mindanao, the
country's second-largest island where the rebels have been strong.
   No major rebel attacks were reported Tuesday. However, such
reports often take days to reach Manila from the countryside.
   A Japanese tourist was shot and killed near the Manila airport
by an unidentified gunman who escaped, police said. Akihiro Sato,
49, died from bullet wounds in the neck and shoulder.
   Police said they had no idea who the killer was.
   Military leaders also announced Tuesday they had determined that
rebels from the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila branch of the New
People's Army, were responsible for Monday's ambush on suburban
Manila Mayor Prospero Oreta. Seven of his bodyguards were killed
and the mayor, a distant relative of President Corazon Aquino, was
wounded.
   Officers said those captured Tuesday might not have been
directly involved, but they definitely came from the same
organizations.
   ``In general, the (Oreta) case is solved,'' said Brig. Gen.
Alexander Aguirre. ``All we have to do is to arrest the people who
perpetrated it. But we are happy to say now that we did not only
arrest the (people) that did the hitting but the leaders who are
orchestrating these assassination activities.''
   The rebel leaders were arrested Tuesday in two separate raids.
An AK-47 rifle, grenades, computers, radio equipment, and
underground documents were confiscated in the raids, Aguirre said.
   He said Mrs. Aquino had been informed about the arrests and
``she was elated, she was glad.''
   On Monday, the Alex Boncayao Brigade admitted responsibility for
Sunday's murder of bus driver Ruben Saulog. They accused him of
ordering the killings of two unions leaders.

<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nigeria's estimated population of 100
million will double in the next two decades unless Nigerian women
have fewer children, the health minister said Tuesday.
   The News Agency of Nigeria quoted Health Minister Ransome-Kuti
as saying the military government's new population policy was aimed
at preserving the health of the ``mothers and their children''
rather than simply reducing population growth.
   The government has adopted a policy calling on women to limit
themselves to four children each. Womens' groups and Christian
churches say the policy is unfair because it would allow polygamous
men to have many children and favors the Moslem religion.
   Ransome-Kuti, in detailing the policy, said efforts would be
made to counsel men on their responsibilities to their spouses and
children.
   He said the government would make family planning services
available nationwide, but would not try to force couples to limit
births.
   ``Couples will be encouraged to have the number of children they
can adequately care for,'' he said.
   Ransome-Kuti said the government hopes to persuade women to
marry after age 18 and to space births at least two years apart.
   He said the policy seeks to reduce annual population growth from
3.3 percent to 2.5 percent in 1995 and 2 percent by 2000.
   Nigeria is Africa's most populous country.

   Harold Thomas was back in his shack Tuesday
alongside the Chicago River after a failed journey to New Mexico in
search of a new life, but he said he was trying to find work and a
decent home.
   ``I've been trying to get me a decent place to stay and I got an
interview about a regular job tomorrow,'' he said. ``I feel like
I've got to make something out of myself some way or other, because
so many people were concerned.
   ``And besides, I owe it to myself,'' said Thomas, who hopes to
find a construction job with a former employer.
   Since his return from Portales, N.M., a week ago, Thomas has
divided his time between a girlfriend's apartment and the
wood-and-tarpaper shack he and friend Tommy Ray built late last
year on a vacant, bottle-strewn lot in the shadow of the city's
glittering downtown.
   ``I go by and help clean it up, and I stay there sometimes,'' he
said of the makeshift shelter by the Chicago River. ``Tommy and
them are sort of my people, like family.
   ``And that's the place where it all happened.''
   Thomas' sojourn to the Southwest began when a New Mexico couple,
Roy and Ethel Gilman, read an Associated Press story describing his
life in the open shack during sub-zero weather.
   They offered him a job and a place to stay.
   Thomas arrived in Portales on Jan. 17 and spent two months with
the Gilmans, receiving room and board in exchange for work at the
couple's wrecking yard.
   But Thomas said he was paid no wages until reporters raised the
issue and the Gilmans put $300 in a bank account for him.
   Thomas withdrew the money and bought a bus ticket home.
   ``They were hard-working, good people, but the money situation
disappointed me,'' said Thomas.
   ``A man needs a regular wage, he needs to be able to buy himself
a cup of coffee or a sandwich. And I think the Gilmans got tired of
all the attention that came with me,'' he said.
   One thing was simplified by his brief fling with celebrity:
reinstatement of the $154 a month in public assistance and food
stamps he had been receiving before he went to New Mexico.
   When he attempted Monday to pick up his March check, Thomas was
told he would have to furnish proof he had worked the two previous
months, and that his job had ended, said social worker Clara
Collins with the non-profit Travelers and Immigrants Aid.
   ``He went back to the shack and brought them his newspaper
clippings,'' Ms. Collins said. ``At first, they said there were
plenty of Harold Thomases, but I guess they finally gave in.''
   So Tuesday, $154 richer and buoyed by the prospect of a job
interview, Thomas picked up some Italian beef sandwiches and headed
for the hovel he still calls home sometimes.
   There, Ray, 37, and 62-year-old Arthur Haymond, another of the
five or six men who share the rotting, often-leaky shack, waited
eagerly for his arrival.
   ``It's funny,'' said Ray. ``After people first read about us,
they came by with a can of coffee, or a loaf of bread to help out.
Or talk about where we might find work.
   ``But since then, hasn't been much but the gang kids throwing
stones and busting us up.
   ``I guess,'' said Ray, rubbing his chin and pulling up closer to
the fire burning in an oil drum, ``people just got short memories.''

<HEAD>Reagan `Augments' Remarks on North's Heroism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB McHUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Tuesday hedged his
assertion that Oliver L. North is a hero, with the president
confining his contining praise to the Marine's combat record.
   Reagan also said he believes North, a former White House
national security aide charged with conspiracy in the Iran-Contra
arms and money affair, hasn't gotten the benefit of a fair trial
before being presumed guilty by many.
   Reagan, saying he wanted to ``augment'' comments he made last
week after North's criminal indictment, said, ``I think I was too
short in my remark.''
   The president was referring to his defense of North as a hero
and his prediction that the Marine lieutenant colonel will be found
innocent of Iran-Contra charges along with Rear Adm. John M.
Poindexter, the former national security adviser to the president
and North's superior.
   Reagan did not reiterate that prediction, but he adjusted his
definition of North's heroism.
   ``I should have augmented that, and said why, and that is: Look
at the record and at the honors and the medals that have been
awarded to him for bravery in combat,'' Reagan said in a White
House interview with regional reporters.
   ``I have to say those were heroic actions and he is a valid
hero,'' the president said.
   North, who intends to retire from the Marine Corps in May,
received a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts in the Vietnam War.
   Reagan said the allegations about North and Poindexter raise a
``sore point with me about a lot of things that have been going on
with regard to people in our administration.''
   ``Someplace along the line, many of us have forgotten that you
are innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,'' the
president said.
   ``What has a happened, I think, in the case (of North and
Poindexter) is it's just everyone is accepting guilt on the basis
of accusation,'' Reagan said. ``I say they've got a right to be
presumed innocent until someone proves them guilty of the charges.''
   North and Poindexter were named March 16 in a federal indictment
accusing them of defrauding the government in the sale of U.S.
weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan
Contras at a time when U.S. aid to the rebels was banned.
   In addition to North and Poindexter, several other past or
present members of the administration _ including some of Reagan's
closest confidants _ have been accused of improper behavior.
   Former aide Michael Deaver was convicted of perjury regarding
his lobbying activities, and Reagan's onetime political director,
Lyn Nofziger, was found guilty of illegal lobbying.
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III has been the subject of
independent counsel investigations. Meese has continually denied
wrongdoing.
   North said after his indictment that he might attempt to
subpoena the ``highest ranking'' government officials to testify in
his defense.
   Reagan declined to say if he would testify on North's behalf.
``I don't know what his situation will be, with regard to giving
testimony or not,'' Reagan said.

<HEAD>EEOC Says Lack of Money Short-Circuited Many Job Discrimination
Cases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
mishandled hundreds of age discrimination complaints partly because
Congress failed to give it enough money, EEOC Chairman Clarence
Thomas said Tuesday.
   In testimony to the House Government Operations subcommittee on
employment and housing, Thomas said there was no excuse for agency
offices having let the two-year statute of limitations expire on
some 1,600 complaints from Oct. 1, 1986, to Jan. 31, 1988.
   But he said that in order to prevent such situations from
recurring, the agency needs more money.
   ``I have been through the budget process seven times now, and
each time, Congress has appropriated less than what was requested
by President Reagan,'' Thomas said in his statement.
   For example, he said, the agency sought $193.4 million this year
but received only $179.8 million, and it has been told its
prospects for receiving a requested $194.6 million in 1989 do not
look good.
   ``If EEOC is held to a 2 percent increase over the fiscal 1988
appropriation, we will lose 244 positions and the pending inventory
of charges will grow by 20,000,'' Thomas said.
   Subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said a recent panel
investigation of the National Labor Relations Board found that 92
percent of unfair labor charges are fully investigated within 30
days.
   ``If the NLRB regional offices can meet a 30-day time target,
why does it take EEOC regional offices more than two years to
perform similar investigations?'' Lantos said. ``We should not need
repeated hearings and legislative action to ensure and to restore
workers' basic civil rights which have long since been established
in law.''
   In his statement, Thomas said the regional offices attributed
their problems to, among other things, short staffing, complex and
unprecedented cases, poor case tracking, heavy workload and charges
filed six months to 18 months after an alleged violation.
   He said the worst offender was the Philadelphia regional office
with 241 charges that expired, followed by Los Angeles with 222;
Baltimore with 175; New York with 150; Chicago with 137; and
Detroit with 105. San Francisco had no instances, while Atlanta and
Charlotte, N.C., had one apiece.
   Helen McDonald, representing the American Association of Retired
Persons, said the EEOC must give people realistic advice about
whether their cases will be pursued and tell them clearly about the
two-year deadline.
   She also said the EEOC should change its policy of refusing to
notify people who might benefit from a class action, even when the
agency already has determined an employer has discriminated.
Currently it is the responsibility of potential members of the
class action to find out about the complaint and join it.
   The House on Tuesday passed a bill extending the statute of
limitations another 18 months for people whose cases expired
without EEOC action. The Senate already has passed a similar
measure.

   Unlike Monday, when three dogs were taken into custody, there
wasn't a canine in sight as Codner delivered the mail with his
companions, who were armed with dog snares _ three-foot and
five-foot sticks with rubber-coated wires at the end to catch any
pooch on the loose.
   ``At least if the dogs come out, they'll have a few more
targets,'' Codner said, when he resumed deliveries. ``Usually it's
just me and the hallway.''
   Mail delivery to 240 households at the Orient Heights rojects
was suspended March 12 after Codner, who has delivered mail there
for seven years, was attacked for the fourth time this year by one
of the dogs roaming the halls.
   For the two weeks Codner didn't bring any mail, it was left at a
post office more than half a mile away.
   ``It was really hard for the elderly people who needed their
mail and couldn't get it,'' said Jackie Thurston, who lives in the
project.
   ``It feels good to have Jimmy and the mail back,'' said Connie
Durbano, another resident.
   The escorted service will last a week. If Codner's customers
don't get the message by then, the Postal Service has threatened to
deliver mail to a single drop instead of door to door.
   Steven O'Donnell, the city's chief dog catcher, said he has
eight inspectors and two trucks _ one currently broken _ to cover a
city of 65,000 dogs. O'Donnell complained that the city won't
invest in better dog control. He also has proposed stiffer fines
for violators.
   The city requires dogs to be restrained at all times. But while
the dog owners are fined $50 if their pets are caught defecating on
the sidewalk, they are fined only $25 for dogs picked up roaming
free.
   In other carrier battlefronts of Massachusetts, mail delivery
was suspended temporarily in parts of Medford a few years ago to
protect carriers, and a carrier bitten in the face by a dog in
Winthrop last weekend may need plastic surgery.
   Every day, somewhere in America, a mail carrier is probably
being bitten, said delivery supervisor Phil Auciello, Codner's boss.

   The Navy on Tuesday formally awarded a $724.4
million contract to the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. to
begin the process of building two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
   The award had been expected since late last fall, when Congress
agreed to amend the fiscal 1988 budget to purchase two carriers at
once in a cost-saving move.
   Newport News Shipbuilding, which is based in the Virginia city
of the same name, is a division of Tenneco Inc. and the only
shipyard capable of building the huge Nimitz-class nuclear carriers.
   The contract awarded Tuesday covers ``long lead time material
and effort'' to get construction started and will be followed
before the end of the fiscal year with a full construction
contract, the Navy said.
   Congress has budgeted $6.3 billion for the two carriers.

   President Chun Doo-hwan's younger
brother denied Tuesday that he stole millions of dollars from a
semi-official development agency, but prosecutors said they had
enough evidence to try him.
   A close associate of Chun Kyung-hwan, 46, tried to kill himself
while under interrogation and arrest warrants were issued for five
other people in the growing scandal.
   ``He keeps denying all charges, passing the buck to his
subordinates, but it would not work. We have enough evidence,''
senior prosecutor Lee Chong-chan said of Chun.
   Twelve hours after questioning, prosecutors gave no indication
whether he would be put under formal arrest. Officials had said
Monday he was not likely to be released.
   Prosecutors said their initial investigation indicated Chun
embezzled or otherwise pocketed the equivalent of $14 million
belonging to the Saemaul (New Community) Movement, which he headed
for seven years.
   The semi-official organization is dedicated to urban and rural
development. Chun Kyung-hwan was its director from 1981 until he
resigned last year after reports that he had links with the
underworld.
   According to the prosecutors, he is suspected of using the money
allegedly taken from Saemaul for such purposes as speculation in
land and stocks.
   Legal experts say charges being contemplated in the case could
result in more than five years in prison if Chun is convicted.
   Chun was summoned by prosecutors Tuesday morning for questioning
about allegations that he abused power to get government funds for
Saemaul and cash donations from business executives.
   When Chun arrived at the prosecutor general's office, a man
rushed from the crowd yelling an insult, hit him in the face and
fled.
   A ranking official of Saemaul, Hwang Hung-sik, 37, made two
suicide attempts during interrogation, once by trying to jump from
a fifth-floor window, officials reported.
   Hwang is accused of keeping secret ledgers on transactions
involving money Chun allegedly embezzled.
   About 200 government officials and business executives have been
questioned about allegedly helping Chun either to amass a fortune
or cover up the activity.
   Opposition parties demanded Tuesday that the former president
cut short a trip to the United States and state whether he was
involved in the scandal.
   Chun Doo-hwan was succeeded last month by Roh Tae-woo, who won
the presidential election in December.
   Roh, a former general who helped put Chun in power with military
backing in 1980, has promised to root out and end official
corruption.

<TEXT>
   A veteran Antarctic researcher announced
findings Tuesday indicating that the depletion of the Earth's ozone
layer could threaten the world's food supply.
   Professor Sayed El-Sayed of Texas A&M University said increased
amounts of ultraviolet light, which a thinner ozone shield permits
through to the Earth's surface, supresses biological activity in
microscopic marine plants in the Antarctic.
   El-Sayed said his findings, the first of their kind, confirm
strong suspicions of biologists that ultraviolet light might mean
trouble for fish, animal and other life in the southernmost part of
the world.
   On the other hand, ``I never underestimate the resilency of
nature,'' he said.
   El-Sayed said it is impossible now to say whether the plankton _
microscopic single-celled organisms called ``the grass of the sea''
_ and the organisms that feed on them might adapt to increased
ultraviolet radiation, and much work remains to be done.
   Plankton and the tiny shrimp-like creature called krill that
feed on them are the primary food source for the whole web of life
in the Antarctic, including fish, penguins and whales. A baleen
whale may eat three tons a day.
   ``If anything happened to the krill population, the whole
ecosystem probably would collapse, and you can say goodbye to the
whales and the penguins and the seals and the fish,'' El-Sayed told
reporters at briefing arranged by the World Resources Institute, a
Washington environmental research organization.
   Several nations are studying plans to harvest krill, a
550-million to 770-million ton reservoir of protein. A 10 percent
annual harvest would almost equal the current world fish catch.
   The ozone shield over Antarctica already thins greatly in
springtime, with the depletion reaching a record 50 percent last
year. Scientists attribute the destruction of ozone to man-made
chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a 1 percent
drop in ozone means a 2 percent increase in ultraviolet light and a
4.8 percent to 7.5 percent increase in the most common skin cancers.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration on March 15
said a depletion of ozone at mid-latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere since 1969 was in all likelihood the result of those
chemicals. The Du Pont Co. said last week it plans to stop making
them.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas told reporters over lunch
Tuesday that the EPA and NASA would try to speed up the first
scientific review under last fall's treaty by 31 nations calling
for a cut in CFC production by 50 percent by 1998.
   Thomas said he would not support bills in the Senate, subject of
a hearing Wednesday, calling for an early 95 percent cut in U.S.
production.
   A U.S. cut beyond international agreement might take the
pressure off other CFC-producing countries to act further, Thomas
said, and would add little to ozone protection.
   Sayed, a biological oceanographer, was supported in his work
last fall on Anvers Island near Palmer Station by the National
Science Foundation. He and the foundation wanted to see if he could
extend earlier German findings that decreases in ultraviolet
enhance plankton growth.

   The Overseas Press Club sent a letter to Gen.

``harsh treatment'' of foreign journalists in Panama City.
   The organization of journalists said in a letter addressed to
the defense forces commander in Panama that the arrests of eight
journalists in Panama on Monday violated United Nations rules on
human rights.
   The journalists were arrested along with 20 opposition leaders
when troops raided the Marriott Hotel, which serves as the
headquarters of Panama's opposition and the foreign press. The
journalists were released Tuesday.
   The letter, signed by Norman A. Schorr, chairman of the club's

   A time bomb in a sack of onions being
taken to market exploded on a rural bus Tuesday, killing 10
Sinhalese farmers and critically wounding 15, police reported.
   A spokesman said nine of the dead were blown to pieces.
   Police blamed the explosion in north-central Sri Lanka on Tamil
militants who have fought since 1983 for a separate homeland for
the ethnic minority in the northern and eastern parts of the island.
   The bomb went off as the bus neared Ratmalagawewa, a village
near Anuradhpura City, about 100 miles northeast of Colombo, police
reported.
   ``Nine persons were blown to bits in the blast and one died in
the hospital. Fifteen more are in critical condition,'' said a
police spokesman at Anuradhpura. ``All are Sinhalese farmers taking
their produce to towns nearby.''
   He said, speaking on condition of anonymity, that the bomb was
the work of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the most powerful
rebel group. Eelam is what the Tamils would call a separate
homeland in the parts of Sri Lanka where the ethnic group is
dominant.
   More than 135 people, most of them Sinhalese, have been killed
in the Eastern and North Central provinces in the past 29 days,
since the latest round of violence began. Residents of Anuradhpura
said large numbers of soldiers were moving into the area for a
``cordon and search'' operation.
   In the southern region, a police sergeant was reported killed
and a constable seriously wounded by a man who opened fire with an
automatic rifle Monday in Tangalle, a town 90 miles southeast of
Colombo.
   Police in Tangalle said the gunman was from the outlawed
People's Liberation Front, a Sinhalese organization opposed to an
Indian-sponsored peace accord intended to halt the Tamil civil war.
   The agreement, signed last July, gives some autonomy to Tamil
areas. Sinhalese nationalists say it makes too many concessions.
   At least 220 killings have been blamed on the radical Sinhalese
group, which has vowed to kill anyone who supports the agreement.
   Sinhalese, most of whom are Buddhists, make up 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils, about 18 percent, are
predominantly Hindu and claim discrimination by the Sinhalese, who
control the government and army.
   At least 7,000 people have been killed in the five years since
the Tamils began fighting. India became involved as a peacemaker
because its 800 million people include about 60 million Tamils,
most of whom live in Tamil Nadu state just across the narrow Palk
Strait from Sri Lanka.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William H. Webster told the
Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that he has reorganized
the spy agency to improve counterintelligence and strengthen
security at U.S. embassies around the world.
   Webster told a closed session of the committee that he has
``reorganized the counterintelligence function within the CIA and
appointed a senior official to head it,'' said a statement issued
by Sens. David L. Boren, D-Okla., and William S. Cohen, R-Maine,
the chairman and senior Republican on the committee
   Boren and Cohen did not name the official appointed by Webster
and the CIA did not immediately return a telephone call concerning
the reorganization.
   Boren and Cohen said Webster informed the committee of ``several
new initiatives within the CIA and the intelligence community
designed to strengthen security at U.S. missions abroad and to
improve counterintelligence in the CIA.''
   The reorganization ``will also combine the critical resources
needed to combat the threat to U.S. personnel and to facilities
overseas,'' the senators said.
   In addition, Webster announced formation of a new, independent
office ``which will report to him in his capacity as director of
central intelligence,'' the senators said.
   Boren said creation of the independent office ``grows out of
recommendations on embassy security'' submitted to President Reagan
by Webster and Secretary of State George P. Shultz in April 1987.
   Reagan asked for the recommendations after reports of widespread
security leaks and espionage at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   The report recommended that the director of central intelligence
certify the security conditions of all existing embassies and of
all new facilities before they are put into operation.
   An earlier report by the Senate Intelligence Committee cited a
need for ``CIA initiatives to improve both its counterintelligence
efforts and its career opportunities in counterintelligence.''
   That report, issued in November 1986, stressed what it called
``the added requirements for counterintelligence support in
intelligence collection programs.''

<TEXT>
   Utah's attorney general has blasted
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh for asking judicial officials
around the country for help in the Iran-Contra case, but others
appear unconcerned about Walsh's activity.
   ``I wasn't going to give Lawrence Walsh's people the time of
day,'' David Wilkinson, the Utah official said, commenting on a
letter he received from the independent counsel's office.
   Jeffrey Toobin, an associate in Walsh's office, sent a letter
March 15 to U.S. attorneys and attorneys general in 50 states
seeking information about other cases involving immunity.
   James Wieghart, Walsh's spokesman, said Monday the letter was a
routine request to ensure that prosecutors are up-to-date on the
most recent case law.
   The letter asks judicial officials for ``anything you think
might be helpful _ established procedures, transcripts, briefs or
even informal office lore.'' The existence of the letter was first
revealed on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal.
   Defendants in the Iran-Contra case are expected to challenge
Walsh on immunity because they received such grants from Congress
in exchange for testifying about the Iran-Contra case last summer.
   Former White House aides John M. Poindexter, Oliver L. North and
businessman Albert Hakim were granted immunity, but Richard V.
Secord, Hakim's partner, was not. The four are charged with
conspiracy and theft in the Iran-Contra case.
   Walsh cannot use any information from the congressional hearings
in court, and he must prove that his data was gathered
independently. Walsh has hired former federal Judge Herbert Stern
to supervise the handling of legal challenges.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell has set April 12 for a
hearing on the immunity issue. Attorneys in the case must file
their papers by April 7.
   Wilkinson, who provided The Associated Press with a copy of the
Toobin letter, said he considered it a ``little bizarre that an
independent counsel would be seeking help from the state attorneys
general.''
   Wilkinson, a Republican, noted that there is a constitutional
dispute over the existence of the independent counsels, which were
created by Congress under the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.
   The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on April 26 on
a lower court decision that struck down the constitutionality of
the special prosecutors.
   Wilkinson said his ``sympathies are with the executive branch,
not the legislative branch.''
   But not everyone was as perturbed as Wilkinson about the letter.
   LeRoy Zimmerman, the GOP attorney general in Pennsylvania, has
directed his staff ``pass along any information or experiences
which would be helpful'' to Walsh's people, according to Bob
Gentzel, his spokesman.
   Attorneys in the office of Travis Medlock, South Carolina's
attorney general, are still reviewing the letter, according to Mark
Dillard, his spokesman.
   Alan Ashby, spokesman for California Attorney General John Van
de Kamp, said he didn't know if his boss had received the letter.
But he said the state and federal judiciary have a ``pretty close
working relationship'' on many issues when the jurisdictions
overlap.

   The Wisconsin presidential primary comes at a
crossroads for the Democratic candidates, with Michael Dukakis
trying to wrest momentum from Jesse Jackson and long-shots Albert
Gore Jr. and Paul Simon trying to keep their campaigns alive.
   ``The results of Michigan have increased the importance of
Wisconsin,'' Tony Tsakakis, a national campaign aide to Dukakis,
said Tuesday.
   After his loss to Jackson in Saturday's Michigan caucuses, the
Massachusetts governor has stepped up his campaign schedule in
Wisconsin ahead of the state's primary next Tuesday, Tsakakis said.
   Dukakis won an endorsement Tuesday from former Wisconsin Gov.
Patrick Lucey, who said the Wisconsin primary and its 81 Democratic
delegates ``is every bit as significant as it was for another
Massachusetts candidate, John F. Kennedy, in 1960.''
   ``We've always felt every state is a must state,'' Tsakakis
said, noting however that Wisconsin now has added significance for
Dukakis' candidacy.
   Dukakis' third-place finish in Illinois behind Simon and Jackson
and his second-place showing in Michigan have tossed uncertainty
into the Democratic race.
   ``We're looking to Wisconsin to continue our ever-broadening
base of support,'' said Jackson aide Bob Burns. ``If we have
reasonably good back-to-back showings in large industrial states,
it will give us a head of steam going into New York'' on April 19.
   Polls indicate the race is a dead heat between Jackson and
Dukakis.
   Jackson has won compliments from Wisconsin's GOP governor, Tommy
Thompson, and even from Vice President George Bush.
   ``His campaign was diminished in the beginning by a lot of
sophisticated observers, politicians,'' Bush said in a Wisconsin
campaign appearance Monday. ``They never gave him much of the time
of day, and he's doing very, very well taking his case to the
people.''
   Bush should literally walk away with the 47 Republican
delegates. Rival Bob Dole quit the race on Tuesday. The only
remaining GOP opponent, Pat Robertson, has made no effort here.
   Colorado's caucuses on Monday, a day before the Wisconsin
primary, are also shaping up as a Jackson-Dukakis fight.
   ``The worst Jackson will do is finish second. But I think he has
a good chance of winning,'' said Mike Stratton, a Denver Democratic
consultant who ran Gary Hart's 1984 Colorado campaign. Stratton
said Jackson's liberal, anti-establishment message was attractive
to many former Hart supporters.
   In Wisconsin, Simon badly needs a good showing in Wisconsin to
keep his campaign alive. After his win in home state Illinois two
weeks ago, Simon said he was pinning his hopes on Wisconsin.
   Gore also has campaigned heavily in Wisconsin and has flooded
television airwaves with his advertisements.
   Gore's father, former Sen. Albert Gore Sr., said Tuesday his son
needs a ``respectable showing'' in Wisconsin, which he defined as a
``strong third.''

<TEXT>
   American builders will be allowed to bid on
Japanese construction projects under a new agreement aimed at
ending a trade dispute that has soured relations between the two
countries.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter told a joint news
conference Tuesday he was pleased that the prolonged, on-and-off
talks had reached ``a fruitful conclusion,'' proving that the two
countries through negotiations are able ``to manage difficult
bilateral trade disputes.''
   Japanese chief negotiator Ochiro Ozawa said he hopes U.S.
construction companies will take full advantage of the agreement
``by taking concrete action to obtain construction licenses in
Japan and actually participating'' in the Japanese construction
boom.
   Ozawa, deputy chief cabinet secretary for Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita, headed the talks as the personal representative of the
prime minister in accordance with Takeshita's agreement with
President Reagan in January that the construction dispute would be
solved amicably, he said.
   ``It is my great pleasure to see a settlement that is amicable,
mutually satisfactory and fruitful,'' Ozawa said.
   Yeutter's deputy, Michael Smith, said the agreement provides for
the Japanese government to facilitate the admittance of American
firms to the bidding on Japanese projects.
   ``It is up to the U.S. firms'' to take advantage of the
agreement, he added.
   Smith said the accord provides for U.S. participation in
construction of the Kansai International Airport and some other
projects on which the two governments had basically agreed last
year.
   Added to it were procedures for bidding on other public works
projects financed by the central government, he said.
   Smith said a third category being opened to U.S. bidders was
local public construction as well as private projects franchised or
approved by the central government.
   These include airport terminals which U.S. builders said they
have been prevented from bidding on despite very competitive
standards.
   The agreement means it will be easier in the future for them to
enter the bidding, Smith said.
   Deputy U.S. Commerce Secretary W. Allen Moore told reporters,
``Our side feels fairly good about the outcome of these talks, but
the real proof of access will be in the future.''
   Moore said Commerce Secretary C. William Verity next week plans
to call heads of major U.S. construction companies to Washington
and ``urge them to take advantage of what we sincerely believe is a
real opportunity.''
   Officials said that besides the multibillion-dollar Kansai
airport project off Osaka the agreement specifically covers entry
of U.S. builders into the bidding for work on such projects as the
Tokyo Bay causeway, the new headquarters of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone Public Corp., the Tokyo Haneda Airport, coastline
development, a new Hiroshima airport, the Tokyo Bay redevelopment
project, the Akashi Straits bridge, the Ise coastal road south of
Nagoya, the new Port 21 planned for Yokohama and a new Kansai
research city planned for the Osaka-Kobe area.

<HEAD>First Lady Receives `Courage Award' From Cancer Society</HEAD>

   First lady Nancy Reagan, who underwent
successful breast cancer surgery last October, received a surprise
``courage award'' from the American Cancer Society on Tuesday for
encouraging other women to seek early detection of the disease.
   ``I can't say this is an award I dreamed of getting when I was
growing up, but if you can help other people deal with this
problem, that makes you feel good,'' she said. ``I hope that's what
has happened.''
   Mrs. Reagan received the award during a Rose Garden ceremony for
60 award winners including actress Jill Ireland, who is the
society's honorary fund-raising chairman.
   Mrs. Reagan and the actress both had a breast removed because of
malignant tumors. The society said the president's wife was honored
for her example of ``strength and courage'' in overcoming breast
surgery and encouraging other women to use mammography, an X-ray
technique for early detection of breast tumors.
   President Reagan told the ``courage award'' winners they had
proved that ``fear was not the end for you but a challenge'' to
triumph over cancer and help others confront the disease.
   ``People need to know that cancer isn't something to run and
hide from, but cancer is a fact that must be faced and dealt
with,'' he said.
   Reagan said he and his wife learned that ``good medical
supervision, early detection and prompt treatment were the keys to
victory over cancer.''
   Reagan underwent surgery in July 13, 1985, for removal of a
small, malignant polyp from his colon. Doctors found another,
larger cancerous polyp that was removed the following day along
with two feet of intestinal tract. They said the cancer had not
spread beyond the tissues that were removed.

   Republican Bob Dole ended his campaign for
president Tuesday, saying he was ``bloodied but unbowed'' by the
series of bruising primary losses that finished his candidacy.
   Dole withdrew before a supportive audience of Senate and House
colleagues and offered congratulations to George Bush, the
all-but-anointed GOP nominee.
   ``My friends know that I am a fighter; I don't like to lose,''
the Senate Republican leader said. ``I have been beaten before, and
no doubt will be again. But I have never been defeated and never
will be.''
   Dole, the Kansas senator, had signaled for days that he was
ready to bow to the inevitable.
   ``One thing you learn how to do pretty well in our business is
to count,'' he said in his withdrawal announcement. ``You come to
trust your instincts to tell you when it's over, and in my heart I
know the time is now. ...
   ``So I return to the Senate as the Republican leader ... ready
to do all I can to elect Republicans in November and doing all I
can for our nominee, George Bush.''
   Bush, in Wisconsin, said he had telephoned Dole to thank him for
a ``very generous statement.'' He added, ``It's been a hard-fought
campaign and I respect the tenacity of Bob Dole.''
   Pat Robertson, in a statement distributed from his headquarters
in Chesapeake, Va., praised Dole as ``a magnificent competitor.''
The former television evangelist, with almost no delegate support,
conceded ``it seems obvious'' that Bush will be the nominee but
said anew that he won't withdraw from the GOP contest.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there was no change
in President Reagan's policy of neutrality, despite Dole's action.
   Dole made his exit before an audience jammed into the Senate
Caucus Room, a historic room where John F. Kennedy launched his
presidential bid and site of the Senate Watergate hearings 15 years
ago and the Iran-Contra hearings a year ago.
   Surveying the crowd and hearing an effusive introduction by Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., Dole began by saying: ``Maybe I ought to
change this.''
   His withdrawal came on the day of the primary in Connecticut,
one of several home states for Bush where another Dole loss was
certain. Dole had for a time hoped to hang on until next week's
primary in Wisconsin, but his outlook was hardly better there, and
Bush's delegate lead appeared insurmountable.
   Dole's candidacy took off in Iowa's caucuses, a farm state where
he benefited from his rural roots in neighboring Kansas. He won the
lead-off delegate event, leaving Bush stunned with a third place
finish behind former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   For almost a week Dole looked like a good bet for the GOP
nomination. But his chances were frozen in New Hampshire.
   He relied on a surge in popularity there built on his Iowa
success. However, in what he later conceded was a tactical mistake,
he didn't counter tough Bush television ads suggesting Dole would
raise taxes. New Hampshire dealt him a loss from which he could not
recover.
   Dole's campaign was beset by internal divisions and vacillation.
Critics said it was a reflection of Dole himself, calling him a
consummate legislator but lacking in executive experience and
unable to delegate authority.
   His campaign was in turmoil after his New Hampshire loss, and
the division between campaign manager Bill Brock and two
conservative campaign consultants broke into the open. Brock fired
them in full view of reporters, ordering them off the campaign
plane.
   Dole's strategy for winning the White House was based primarily
on winning the first two contests, and when he fell short in New
Hampshire his candidacy collapsed.
   He found himself far behind Bush in the Southern primaries on
Super Tuesday three weeks later. Unable to focus his energies on
his best opportunities, he lost everywhere.
   Dole couldn't turn the race around in Illinois and was
effectively out of the running.
   He campaigned last week in Wisconsin, but public opinion polls
indicated a 2-to-1 Bush lead. By week's end, Dole appeared to be
weary of waging a campaign that was only going through the motions.
   ``I can read the numbers and I probably know what's happening,''
he said.
   ``We need to keep a Republican in the White House. That's where
I'm coming from,'' he said. ``And if it can't be me, it will be
George Bush.''
   Dole, the 1976 vice presidential nominee in Gerald Ford's losing
re-election bid, ran for the presidential nomination in 1980. That
quickly ended in failure as Ronald Reagan won.
   Eight years later, Dole was frustrated by a feeling that he
still had to run against Reagan. Bush, Reagan's loyal vice
president, inherited many of the president's supporters despite
Dole's best efforts.
   ``I'm sort of running against the ghost of Ronald Reagan,'' Dole
said recently.
   Dole attacked Bush as lacking leadership qualities, as having a
full resume but no real experience, and for involvement in the
Reagan administration's major disaster, the Iran-Contra affair.
   None of it stuck.
   Dole tried repeatedly to stir resentment against Bush and his
patrician background. But Dole's argument that he himself was ``one
of us'' apparently won over only Iowans.
   He was always dogged by a reputation for meanness, begun in the
public's mind when he played the hatchet-man role on the 1976
ticket. Although he tried to soften that persona, he sometimes
revealed bitterness.
   The night of his New Hampshire loss, he accused Bush of
``lying'' about the Dole record during a joint live television
interview.

<HEAD>Swaggart Barred from Pulpit for Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fiery evangelist Jimmy Swaggart was
ordered Tuesday not to preach from the pulpit or his television
show for at least a year while he is rehabilitated from ``moral
failure'' that reportedly included paying a prostitute to pose nude.
   In announcing its decision, the Assemblies of God elders
disregarded a more lenient three-month suspension recommended by
the church in Louisiana. The national church included provisions
for two years of rehabilitation and counseling to begin when
Swaggart has agreed to rehabilitation in writing.
   Louisiana district officials refused comment, as did the Jimmy
Swaggart Worldwide Ministries in Baton Rouge, La. But a spokesman
said Swaggart's ministry would have a statement Wednesday.
   Swaggart is the latest evangelist to be forced from the pulpit.
His accuser, Marvin Gorman, was forced from the Assemblies of God
when he admitted to an immoral act with a woman. And Jim and Tammy
Bakker were forced from their PTL ministry in a scandal that
included a sexual encounter between Bakker and young female
follower.
   ``It is hoped that Jimmy Swaggart will agree to this program of
rehabilitation and that such program will be redemptive and
restorative in the life and ministry of our brother,'' the Rev. G.
Raymond Carlson, the church's general superintendent, said in a
statement.
   People approved by the church would supervise the
rehabilitation, Carlson said. He provided no other details.
   ``If he does not accept, then the Executive Presbytery would
take action to dismiss him,'' Carlson said at a news conference.
   Under the terms of rehabilitation, Swaggart would be barred from
his pulpit for at least a year and would have to stop distributing
videotaped services that have enabled him to build a worldwide
congregation.
   ``He will not be in the pulpit and he would not participate in
that kind of ministry _ he would not address his congregation, per
se,'' Carlson said at the news conference. ``I believe we are
asking him to be absent from television ministry.''
   Church officials say Swaggart confessed to them in detail but
they have refused to make his transgression public. Reports have
linked him to a prostitute who says he paid her to pose naked.
   Carlson said he called Swaggart on Tuesday to inform him of the
church's decision, but the two did not discuss whether Swaggart
would accept rehabilitation.
   ``He thanked me,'' Carlson said. ``He expressed thanks, and I
had prayer with him over the telephone.''
   Swaggart has 30 days to appeal to the 13-member Executive
Presbytery, which serves as a board of directors and which set the
terms of rehabilitation.
   Church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said church elders, who have
been grappling with the case since Swaggart stepped down from his
pulpit Feb. 21, are unlikely to change their decision.
   The Louisiana district had recommended that Swaggart be barred
from preaching for three months. National officials say every other
Assemblies minister who has confessed to moral failure has been
barred from preaching for at least a year.
   The Louisiana district refused requests from the Executive
Presbytery to reconsider, and apparently also questioned the
national leadership's authority to determine discipline.
   H. Maurice Lednicky, a general presbytor and president of the
Assemblies Central Bible College in Springfield, said the question
of authorities was the focus the presbytors meeting Monday and
Tuesday.
   In the end, the 232-member General Presbytory, an oversight
body, decided that the Executive Presbytory had authority to
discipline Swaggart, said Carlson, a member of the Executive
Presbytery. The presbytors later endorsed, on a voice vote, the
terms of rehabilitation.
   Robert S. King, a member of the Louisiana District Council from
Lafayette, said he disagreed with the decision.
   ``I feel his (Swaggart's) ministry is unique and much depends on
it. I feel God has forgiven him, he has asked God and men to
forgive him and we ought to forgive him. Ought to restore him to
the pulpit quickly,'' he said.
   But Lednicky and other general presbytors in Springfield said
they supported the Executive Presbytery. ``I think it helps not
only the ministers but the general public to feel that there is
integrity,'' he said.
   Frank Martin, a general presbytor representing the Tennessee
district, said the decision ``showed mercy.''
   After Swaggart's tearful confession to an unspecified sin, Debra
Murphree, who has a record of arrests on prostitution charges, said
he paid her to pose naked in a hotel room.
   In a related development, the National Religious Broadcasters on
Friday recommended terminating Swaggart's membership, the
organization's executive director said Tuesday. Termination doesn't
become final until approved by the group's board of directors,
which meets next February.
   `If they can't show the code and the logo like the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval on their programs it should affect
their donations,'' said the Rev. Benjamin L. Armstrong, executive
director of the 1,400-member organization.

   Iraq accused Iran on Tuesday of using
poison gas in its Kurdistan offensive and threatened to attack
Iranian cities with chemical weapons.
   Iran, which accused the Iraqis of using chemical bombs in the
same area last week, said Revolutionary Guards were moving deeper
into Iraq territory in the northern campaign.
   Baghdad's official news agency said Iraqi warplanes raided two
ships off Iran in the Persian Gulf overnight, but there was no
independent confirmation. About 500 vessels have been attacked by
both sides since the war began in September 1980.
   Iranian rebel groups based in Iraq, said to include women
fighters for the first time, appeared to have pushed into the
oil-rich Khuzestan province of southwest Iran, around the town of
Fakkeh.
   There was no independent confirmation of the operation by the
National Liberation Army of Iran but the Iranians, who claimed
Monday the offensive was repulsed, said their warplanes bombed
``enemy forces'' Tuesday in the Fakkeh region.
   On Monday the rebels said several thousand fighters with tanks
moved into Khuzestan in their biggest offensive yet. Alireza
Jafer-Zada, a spokesman in Baghdad, claimed on Tuesday they had
killed or wounded thousands of Iranian soldiers.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Iran fired two missiles
Tuesday into Mandali, 70 miles northeast of Baghdad. Iraq did not
report the attack.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said nine civilians
were killed in Iraqi air raids on four western and southern Iranian
cities. Tehran radio said Iranian fighters shot down two Iraqi
warplanes in a dogfight. Iraq denied it.
   Nuri Nayef, head of the Iraqi News Agency office in Cairo, said
Tuesday an Iraqi government spokesman told him the military ``might
choose a number of large Iranian cities to be the targets of
chemical weapons as a deterrent and punitive measure.''
   He said the spokesman, whom he did not identify, declared that
Iran used chemical weapons in Kurdistan last week and Iraq may
respond in kind.
   Iran says Iraq dropped chemical bombs March 16-17 on Halabja,
Dojaila and Khormal, three Kurdish towns in Iraq captured by
Iranian troops in an offensive that began March 16. Iran said 5,000
people were killed and 5,000 wounded.
   Western correspondents taken to Halabja by the Iranians last
week reported seeing hundreds of dead civilians unmarked by wounds.
   Most of Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds live in the northeast. Kurdish
separatist guerrillas, now backed by Iran, have been fighting Iraqi
governments for decades, and Halabja was the scene of a Kurdish
rebellion last year.
   Baghdad has not confirmed or denied employing chemical weapons,
but the United Nations has said four times since 1984 that Iraq has
used poison gas bombs or artillery shells.
   Iran has accused the Iraqis of more than 100 chemical attacks in
that period.
   On Saturday, Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council said it
had the right to defend itself ``with all available weapons.''
   At the United Nations in New York, Iraq criticized a U.N.
decision to send two experts to to investigate the Iranian reports
and urged that another team be sent to check on reports of murder
and torture of Iraqi prisoners of war in Iran.
   Iran said its warplanes were in action Tuesday to support
Revolutionary Guard units it claims have penetrated about 15 miles
into the Darbandikhan region of northeastern Iraq since March 16.
   The Iranians say the invasion force has killed or wounded nearly
13,500 Iraqis, captured more than 5,000 and destroyed 225 tanks and
armored vehicles.
   Iraq has admitted losing territory in Kurdistan but has given no
details.
   If the Iranian claim is confirmed, it would be Iraq's worst
military setback since Iranian forces drove to within six miles of
Basra, the southern regional capital, early last year.

<HEAD>House Rejects Bill Giving States Title to Historic Shipwrecks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House narrowly rejected a bill Tuesday
that would have awarded the states title to abandoned shipwrecks of
historic significance lying within their waters, a proposal
strongly opposed by sport divers and some commercial salvage
operators.
   The House defeated the measure, 263-139, which was five votes
short of the two-thirds majority required for passage. The bill
passed the Senate by voice vote on Dec. 19.
   Opponents complained that the bill was brought to the floor
under parliamentary ground rules usually adopted for abbreviated
debate on non-controversial bills, with no amendments allowed.
   The bill's supporters, led by Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla.,
were expected to try to return the measure to the House floor under
different rules which would allow opponents to introduce amendments
and would require only a simple majority for passage.
   Rep. Norman D. Shumway, R-Calif., complained that under the
bill, ``there is no legal, binding or enforceable way ... to ensure
that the sport divers' right to dive on these wrecks, even for
purely recreational purposes, will be protected by states.''
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., countered that ``its passage will
go a long way toward preserving these archaeological treasures,''
although he agreed with Shumway that the bill may discourage
private exploration for undiscovered shipwrecks.
   Without the bill, said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., dynamiting and
other abuses by some reckless treasure hunters ``would absolutely
guarantee for future generations that these shipwrecks, these
valuable pieces of history, (would) be lost for all time.''
   Vento said guidelines to be published by the National Park
Service under the bill would protect historic shipwrecks in state
waters while permitting orderly access by sport divers, fishing
enthusiasts and others.
   The bill would give states title to the estimated 5 percent to
10 percent of the shipwrecks in state waters that are considered
historically important. All others having no historic interest,
plus all shipwrecks lying beyond 3 miles offshore would be governed
by federal admiralty law.
   Admiralty law awards shipwrecks and cargoes to the finders and
permits salvage operators to claim a major portion of the cargoes
they raise.
   Under the bill, admiralty law would not apply to the small
number of historically significant shipwrecks in state waters, and
Indian tribes would have title to shipwrecks on their lands. The
federal government would retain title to any abandoned wrecks on
public lands.
   Until now, both states and federal admiralty courts have claimed
jurisdiction over abandoned historic shipwrecks in state waters.
   The Submerged Lands Act of 1953 gave the states ownership of all
natural resources and submerged lands up to 3 miles offshore but
did not cover artificial objects such as shipwrecks on those lands.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz failed on
Tuesday to persuade the Arab League to support his proposal for
Mideast peace talks.
   But a spokesman for the 21-nation group, which also includes the
Palestine Liberation Organziation, said the Reagan administration
seemed to be more sensitive to the Arab viewpoint.
   The 90-minute meeting at the State Department was part of
Shultz's preparation for his trip to the region beginning Sunday
night. He will try to nudge Israel and a mixed delegation of
Jordanians and Palestinian Arabs to open talks May 1.
   Shultz met with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Shara',
Algerian Ambassador Mohammad Sahnoun, Saudi Arabian Ambassador
Bandar Bin Sultan and other league representatives.
   The league spokesman, Clovis Maksoud, said they disagreed with
Shultz on several issues, including the league's demand for a seat
at the negotiating table for the PLO.
   ``We think the PLO should be represented on an equal footing,''
Maksoud said.
   Shultz met Saturday with two members of the Palestine National
Council, the legislative arm of the PLO. But State Department
spokesman Charles E. Redman said Monday this did not conflict with
the U.S. policy of not dealing with Yasser Arafat's organization.
   Both the United States and Israel consider the PLO a terrorist
group. Shultz has demanded it recognize Israel's right to exist and
disavow terrorism as conditions for U.S. acceptance.
   Maksoud said the league and Shultz also disagreed on the scope
of a peace conference on the Middle East. The Arabs want the United
States, the Soviet Union and the three other permament members of
the U.N. Security Council _ China, Britain and France _ to play an
active role in Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Shultz would restrict the conference to launching direct
peace-making talks. The Soviet Union and China do not have
diplomatic relations with Israel and provide modern arms to Syria
and Saudi Arabia, respectively.
   ``I cannot say we reached any conclusive agreements,'' Maksoud
said.
   Still, he said ``the secretary of state showed a measure of
openness'' to the league's views. ``We found the United States
perhaps more sensitive to some of our concepts.''
   Shultz has called for an Israeli withdrawal from at least some
of the West Bank and Gaza, which Jordan and Egypt lost in the 1967
Six-Day war. Maksoud said the league wants the Israeli-held
territories evacuated completely.

<HEAD>Wright Discloses Assets He Held With Business Partner</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright has filed amended
financial disclosure statements covering the past seven years to
list assets he held with a Fort Worth business partner, including
stocks, real estate and ``precious and semi-precious stones.''
   Wright filed the disclosures, required by House reporting forms,
after failing to do so since he and developer George A. Mallick and
their wives formed the venture, Mallightco Inc., in 1979. The name
of the business is a combination of the two couples' last names.
   In the past, the Texas Democrat has listed the company on his
disclosure forms with an aggregate value category, but never has
detailed the underlying assets of the venture. In some cases, the
total values given in the new forms conflict with those filed
previously.
   An aide to Wright, Marshall Lynam, said the speaker had been
simply unaware of any requirement for disclosure of the
corporation's assets until his attorneys told him about it last
year while preparing to put the assets in a blind trust.
   The corporation's holdings at that time were detailed in the
blind trust announcement, but the new disclosure filings are the
first public record of the trust's holdings and activities for
previous years.
   On March 18, Wright filed amended reports with the House Clerk's
office detailing those holdings for the years 1980 through 1986.
The speaker's office did not call attention to the filings, and the
existence of the amended forms was disclosed Tuesday by Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., who has harshly criticized Wright for alleged
ethical shortcomings.
   In each of the seven years, the amended forms show Mallightco's
total value at between $100,001 and $250,000. The forms require
disclosure of values only in broad ranges, so it is impossible to
tell precise amounts.
   In 1980, the first year in which Mallightco appears on Wright's
disclosure statements, Wright's one-half share of the company
included savings accounts and ``fixed assets'' worth less than
$5,000 each; stocks and bonds worth $50,000 to $100,000; and notes
receivable owed by Wright (under $5,000), his wife Betty ($15,001
to $50,000) and Marlene Mallick ($15,001 to $50,000).
   The stocks included Tandy Corporation, Gulf Oil, American Quasar
Petroleum and First National Bank of Weatherford, valued at less
than $5,000 each, and Supron Oil, Delphi Oil and Western Co. of
North America, each valued at $15,001 to $50,000.
   The value of the venture's stock portfolio declined over the
next three years as values dropped and some stocks apparently were
sold. At the same time, Wright's debt to the partnership climbed to
the range of $15,001 to $50,000.
   In 1983, the disclosure form adds ``precious and semi-precious
stones'' worth $15,001 to $50,000 to Wright's share of the assets.
Also added to the assets list is a $5,001 to $15,000 note
receivable from The Mallick Company.
   Wright apparently paid off part of his debt to the business in
1985, and his debt dropped to the range of $5,001 to $15,000.
   In the final year for which an amendment was filed, 1986, the
assets list is enlarged to include ``real estate near Orlando,
Fla.,'' with a value in the range of $50,001 to $100,000.
   The total values for Mallightco were increased in the amended
forms for the years 1983 and 1984, when previous filings had put
the value in the range of $50,001 to $100,000.
   Mallick has figured in news reports about Wright's efforts to
get a federal grant for the renovation of Fort Worth's stockyards,
a project in which Mallick was involved. Wright said he had been
unaware of his associate's involvement when he was seeking the
grant.
   After criticism about those financial dealings and others
mounted last fall, Wright put his assets in a blind trust and said
he had instructed his attorneys to sell his interest in Mallightco.
   Wright's attorney, Charles M. Levy, put the total assets of the
speaker and his wife at the time at $187,317, not counting their
house in McLean, Va., personal retirement funds and 57 acres of
property in Arkansas.

<HEAD>McCloskey Considers Suing Robertson for Legal Fees</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 2 grafs after 10th graf pvs, bgng: ``Now we, with
Robertson comment; ADDS 4 grafs on McCloskey's lawyers asking for
court costs</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Rep. Paul McCloskey Jr. said Tuesday he
is considering suing Pat Robertson to recover $400,000 in legal
fees he incurred when the Republican presidential candidate sued
him for libel.
   McCloskey said his lawyers believe they can be prove that
Robertson made frivolous use of the court system in suing McCloskey
over his statements about Robertson's Korean war record.
   At a National Press Club luncheon, McCloskey repeated the story
he has told for years about being in Marine officer training school
with Robertson and then being shipped to Korea in 1950. McCloskey
contends that while he and others were sent off to combat,
Robertson ducked combat duty using the influence of his father, the
late Sen. A. Willis Robertson, D-Va.
   McCloskey said he and others recall Robertson boasting about how
``I'm going to call my daddy to get me out of this thing.''
   Robertson dropped his legal suit against McCloskey earlier this
month, citing a trial opening set for March 8, the date of the
critical Super Tuesday series of presidential primaries and
caucuses in 20 states. He said the trial would force him to choose
between his campaign and the legal case.
   However, McCloskey contended Tuesday that Robertson dropped the
lawsuit because the evidence supporting the former California
congressman's story was unbeatable.
   He said 21 former Marines were ready to testify on his side and
that letters from Robertson's father supported his case.
   The evidence that Robertson brought suit frivolously is in a
letter written by Robertson to a California politician in 1985 in
which Robertson said that McCloskey believed he was telling the
truth but that his memory was faulty, the ex-congressman said.
   That would negate the veracity of a suit claiming McCloskey
willfully lied about the former television evangelist's record,
McCloskey said.
   ``Now we have enough to sue him for misusing the legal
process,'' he said.
   Robertson, however, insisted he could have won the case.
   ``Every testimony that was to be was already in the record. The
record was closed. The record was complete. In the record, I won,''
Robertson said at a news conference Tuesday in Chesapeake, Va.
``Unfortunately, the judge gave me a Hobson's choice that I could
not abide with.''
   A federal judge dismissed the case on March 7 after Robertston
agreed to pay court costs, but not McCloskey's $400,000 in legal
fees.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green signed the order dismissing
the case ``with prejudice,'' which means that McCloskey was legally
the victor in the case.
   McCloskey's lawyers, meanwhile, asked Robertson to pay $42,845
in court costs now that the libel suit has been dismissed.
   In a bill of court costs that was made public Tuesday in U.S.
District Court, McCloskey's lawyer George Lehner aksed for, among
other things, $15,794 to cover the cost of taking depositions from
witnesses and $19,458 for photocopying documents.
   Lehner said this figure included $16,000 to make large-size
trial exhibits of 30 to 35 documents.
   Robertson's lawyer, Douglas V. Rigler, who has 11 days to file
any opposition to the bill declined to say if he would make any
objection. ``I would want to discuss that with my client, but just
on first glance it looks extravagant.''

   M.S. ``Bud'' Rukeyser, NBC's executive vice
president for communications, said Tuesday he is leaving the
network to go into business for himself, giving ``advice and
counsel to media companies.''
   Rukeyser, 56, has been at NBC for 30 years, the last 15 as the
network's chief spokesman.
   ``For 15 years, I've been whispering in the ears of four
different chief executive officers. I thought if I was ever going
to do something else, try something on my own, it was going to have
to be now or never,'' Rukeyser said.
   He said NBC President Robert C. Wright reacted to the news by
saying NBC would be Rukeyser's first client.
   Asked if he would be working with his former boss Grant Tinker,
now head of GTG Entertainment, Rukeyser said he had had no such
discussions with Tinker, but added, ``I certainly would hope so.''
   Betty Hudson, now head of publicity for NBC, will become
spokeswoman for the network, Rukeyser said.

   Rep. Richard Gephardt said Tuesday he
regretted not doing better in the Democratic presidential race but
was determined to work in Congress toward the same goals of his
campaign for the White House.
   Reflecting on his failed White House bid after filing for
re-election to his St. Louis congressional seat, Gephardt said he
knew his campaign was in trouble March 8 when he lost 19 Super
Tuesday states and won only Missouri.
   ``Super Tuesday was the hard night because that was when you
really knew you were on the ropes,'' Gephardt said. But he added
there was a positive side to being out of the race.
   ``There's always a bittersweet in everything in life. We're
disappointed, and yes, we wanted t  The 47-year-old congressman said he

  their three young children would not be thrust into

   ``We couldn't go to a movie or a drugstore without an
entourage,'' Gephardt said. ``Their lives would never be the same
(because of) my choices, my success. So now we can go to the
drugstore and the movies and be fairly normal.''

formally withdrew from the race and called himself ``the luckiest

   The Senate Finance Committee agreed Tuesday to
grant a fuel-tax exemption for farmers and other off-the-road
diesel users on April 1 and to make corporations foot the bill.
   However, the future of the proposed relief remained in doubt
because the House Ways and Means Committee, which must originate
tax bills, has scheduled no action on the diesel proposal. Backers
of the legislation are holding out hope that the House panel will
approve a bill this week before adjourning for Easter week.
   Farmers, fishermen and others who use diesel for off-the-road
business purposes traditionally have been exempt from the tax,
which finances highway construction. But under a 1987 law aimed at
preventing cheating, they must begin paying the tax on April 1 and
then apply for a refund when they file their income-tax returns
next year.
   The Finance Committee voted last week to grant these users
relief from paying the tax at all but, because of budget
restrictions, it acted to provide the exemption on Oct. 1. At the
direction of the committee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the
chairman, introduced an amendment Tuesday that steps up the relief
to April 1.
   The committee is getting around the budget problem by tightening
collections of corporate taxes. This would cost corporations an
extra $508 million from 1988 through 1993, with the bulk of the
additional money coming from expedited collections this year and
next.
   Under the change, a corporation that shifts its method of
calculating estimated taxes from one quarter to the next would have
to make up in the subsequent quarter 96 percent of the reduction
achieved in the previous period. This change would be phased in
over two years.
   Providing the diesel-tax relief for off-road users will cost
about $615 million during the same six-year period. Another part of
the package is a ``taxpayer bill of rights'' aimed at reducing
Internal Revenue Service powers in some disputes with taxpayers.
These changes would cost about $517 million through 1993.
   Other provisions would double the gas-guzzler tax on inefficient
cars, mainly expensive imports, and limit the abilities of
distilleries to dodge part of the whisky tax through what is known
as a wine credit.
   The net revenue effect of the package would be to raise taxes by
$104 million over six years.

<HEAD>British Minister Meets With Northern Ireland Catholics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom King, Britain's minister
for Northern Ireland, met Tuesday with leaders of the main Roman
Catholic political party in an effort to resolve a political
stalemate in the troubled province.
   King and leaders of the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP)
conferred for about two hours on the political situation and new
surge of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
   SDLP leader John Hume said after the meeting, ``We are ready to
sit down and talk with anyone,'' including the Ulster Unionists who
represent the Protestant majority.
   Hume said the negotiations would have to be about ``how we solve
the problem in our society'' rather than who wins power. ``We
believe we should be talking face to face with the Unionists. The
sooner we get there the better,'' he added.
   Hume recently met with Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the
legal political wing of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. The
Unionists denounced that meeting, saying the SDLP was giving
credibility to terrorists.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA has been waging a violent
campaign since 1969 to unite Northern Ireland, where Protestants
outnumer Catholic 3-2, with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of
Ireland.
   Five people have died this month in murderous rampages at two
IRA funerals. The killings climaxed two weeks of rising tension
after British commandos shot dead three unarmed IRA guerrillas in
Gibraltar.
   Hume said his delegation told King of their party's desire to
see all factions work together to create stability in the British
province, where more than 2,600 people have been killed in
sectarian violence since 1969.
   A British government statement said the meeting ``had been
arranged to consider the possiblity of moving to a wider dialogue,
involving the constitutional parties, about the future government
of Northern Ireland.''
   The British Broadcasting Corporation reported King and the party
leaders discussed setting up of some form of power-sharing
administration involving Protestants and Catholics.
   Hume said his talks with Adams were not mentioned at the meeting
with King.
   The Hume-Adams talks had drawn speculation of a possible
temporary cease-fire. But Irish nationalists insisted the IRA had
no intention of halting its campaign and Hume told Independent
Television News he was only interested in discussing a permanent
truce.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Jackson retort in grafs 3-4</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said Tuesday that Jesse
Jackson has a ``complete and total lack'' of experience to be
president and criticized what he said was Jackson's ``notion that
there's a moral equivalence between Israel and the PLO.''
   He also said of Jackson, an ordained minister known for his
ringing speeches, ``We're not choosing a preacher; we're choosing a
president.''
   Jackson, campaigning in East Harlem when told of Gore's remarks,
said, ``The senator should not discriminate against someone because
they are a preacher, a priest or a rabbi.''
   ``I assume that he is stimulated by his own status in the
campaign to attack me. I am stimulated to keep hope alive,''
Jackson said.
   Addressing Jewish audiences in New York, Gore also criticized
another Democratic presidential rival, Michael Dukakis, for ``naive
legalism'' in his approach to foreign policy and ``an exaggerated
faith in the United Nations.''
   Gore said he was dismayed by Jackson's ``embrace of'' Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Cuban leader Fidel
Castro.
   Venturing where other Democratic candidates have feared to
tread, Gore sharply criticized Jackson's foreign policy views and
contrasted his own experience and beliefs with those of the civil
rights activist.
   Other Democratic candidates have shied away from attacks on
Jackson, apparently assuming he won't win the nomination and
wanting to pick up his supporters. But there had been speculation
that that would change after Jackson's victory in last week's
Michigan caucuses solidified his position in the forefront of the
Democratic race.
   Gore credited Jackson with having ``energized millions of
voters'' and having offered ideas on drugs and the economy.
   ``But I part company with him over his opposition to such
mainstays of our national defense as the F-15 and the cruise
missile,'' Gore said. ``I categorically reject his notion that
there's a moral equivalence between Israel and the PLO. And I am
dismayed by his embrace of Arafat and Castro.''
   As for Dukakis, Gore pointed to his disagreement with the
Massachusetts governor over a recent letter signed by 30 Senate
members. Gore said he was asked and declined to sign the letter,
which disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
opposition to exchanging occupied land for recognition by Arab
states. Dukakis, he noted, said he would have signed the letter.
   Gore, in appearances before a civic group and a coalition of
Jewish organizations, said the Democratic race was far from over
and that Jackson's sudden ascendancy could be as fleeting as Gary
Hart's had been.
   ``When Gary Hart got back into the race and he rocketed to the
top of the polls, a lot of people expressed a sense of panic,''
Gore told reporters at a breakfast of the Association for a Better
New York. ``This race changes from day to day.''
   Later, answering questions after a speech to the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Gore said he
hasn't been afraid to criticize Jackson.
   ``I have sharp disagreements with Jesse Jackson,'' the Tennessee
senator said. ``I (have) talked about his complete and total lack
of experience in the national government. He hasn't served a single
day in the national government, or had a single day's experience in
foreign policy.
   ``He has said, `I'm a tree shaker, not a jelly maker.' Well,
some jelly has to be made in the White House, so to speak. If you
need brain surgery, you're going to want to know if the surgeon has
gone to medical school or has had experience practicing that
particular line of work.
   ``We need a president who is prepared to tackle some of the
toughest problems we have ever had in our foreign policy and our
domestic policy, and we need a president who has the experience to
do that job well.''
   Gore was applauded for his criticism of Jackson.
   In his speech to the Jewish group, Gore contrasted his support
of Israel with Jackson's recognition of the Palestine Liberation
Organization. He also said he was ``deeply troubled'' by a report
of Chinese weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and urged steps by the
United States to discourage such trade.
   The Tennessean said the New York primary on April 19 would be a
critical test of his candidacy, but he did not say he had to win it
_ only ``do extremely well.''
   New York will send 255 delegates to the Democratic National
Convention.

   Reporters were allowed into the Chinese
legislature's small group meetings for the first time Tuesday, but
saw a limited amount of the free and lively discussion that has
been ballyhooed by the official news media.
   In the Tibetan Room of the Great Hall of the People, seat of
China's government, 19 delegates from Tibet gathered for what was
supposed to be an example of democracy at work.
   Foreign and Chinese reporters crowded the room in anticipation
of observing delegates engaged in a free exchange of ideas.
   But many soon left as one delegate after another to the National
People's Congress read lengthy, prepared speeches, praising
economic reform and China's open-door policy and calling for unity
and perseverence in the ``great work of socialist construction.''
   Western reporters who attended other provincial discussion
groups said the action was a little livelier as delegates
interrupted each other to add remarks or to disagree.
   The reporters said they were surprised that their presence
seemed not to deter delegates from criticizing the implementation
of policies in their areas.
   But most speakers prefaced critical remarks by saying they
agreed with China's policies of reform and with the report
presented by acting Premier Li Peng at Friday's opening session of
the congress.
   China has given lavish publicity to what it says is the
increasingly democratic nature of its government. For the first
time this year, there were more candidates than seats in elections
for local people's congresses.
   The media portrayed the small group discussions as being the
heart of the democratic exercise. The national TV evening news for
two days has devoted nearly half its domestic news to showing
delegates in animated exchanges.
   But in the Tibetan Room, 20 minutes passed before the first
delegate spoke out of turn, and then it was to support his
colleague's statements.
   At the 2{-hour meeting, delegates were seldom interrupted and no
one expressed disagreement or a differing viewpoint.
   Most delegates seemed disinterested, smoking absently and
staring into space. Through much of the session, the Panchen Lama,
Tibetan Buddhism's second-highest leader and a vice chairman of the
National People's Congress, carried on a private conversation with
his neighbor Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, chairman of the Tibetan People's
Congress.
   Western reporters said delegates in other groups took a more
active role in discussions. ``There was a certain amount of give
and take,'' one reporter said.
   In the Liaoning province group, a rural school teacher found
fault with government education policy and delegates frequently
interrupted one another to disagree.
   The Tibetan delegates and those representing China's other
minorities used the discussion groups to cite what they said was
the lower standard of living in many minority regions and to say
they wanted more favorable minority policies.

   Israel's army isolated the
occupied territories Tuesday, but Palestinians threw gasoline bombs
at patrolling soldiers and the Israelis opened fire and wounded
eight of the demonstrators.
   The unprecedented crackdown on the 1.5 million Arabs in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip was aimed at halting four months
of unrest and at preventing mass demonstrations by Palestinians on
Wednesday's 12th anniversary of Land Day, when Israeli soldiers
killed six Arabs protesting land confiscation.
   Foreign relief workers were barred from entering the occupied
lands. Thousands of police were mobilized Tuesday evening to
enforce curfews in Arab towns in Israel.
   Arabs reported that demonstrators took to the streets in some
areas, throwing rocks and gasoline bombs, and that Israeli troops
fired at the curfew violators. The eight Arabs were wounded in the
village of Zaita, 40 miles northwest of Jerusalem, the army and the
Palestine Press Service reported.
   Among the protesters reported wounded was 13-year-old girl.
   In Ramallah, small children tossed rocks at each other in the
streets. They called the game ``Jews and Arabs.''
   Hundreds of protesters have been wounded since riots began Dec.
8 in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and
Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War. The death toll stands at 119
Palestinians and one Israeli soldier, according to U.N. figures.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
Israel's military chief of staff, threatened for the first time
Tuesday to close the territories for an extended period.
   ``For now, the decision to close the areas is for three days,''
Rabin said on Israel radio. ``But I've always said we have to
adjust our measures to confront every eventuality.''
   In an Israel television interview, Rabin said more than 4,000
Palestinians arrested in the months of violence are being held at
army detention centers. He said that number included prisoners
served with administrative detention orders.
   Closing the occupied lands is intended to quell the violence by
imposing collective punishment on Palestinians and to keep out
journalists, whose reports the Israelis claim feed the rebellion.
   Although general access for journalists has been withdrawn, U.S.
television pools were allowed into the West Bank and Gaza on
Tuesday and some individual journalists managed to get past
roadblocks.
   Particularly harsh restrictions have been put on the Gaza Strip.
The rebellion began there and the 6-mile-long Mediterranean coastal
area is easier to isolate.
   ``No human beings are on the streets,'' said Rashad al Shawaa,
who was deposed by Israel as mayor of Gaza City in 1983. ``It's
like a cemetery. The army announced over loudspeakers: `Anyone who
leaves their home will be shot'.''
   He told The Associated Press by telephone he saw soldiers fire
on a few Palestinians who went out in his neighborhood.
   Shawaa said the telephone call was the first he had received in
26 hours. Telephone service to Gaza was cut Monday and it mostly
remained out Tuesday night.
   Bernard Mills, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency director in
Gaza, told U.N. officials by radio: ``You have 650,000 people under
house arrest.''
   UNRWA cares for Palestinian refugees in the territories. About
650,000 Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip and 850,000 in the West
Bank.
   Foreign journalists asked the Supreme Court to overturn the
order banning them from the territories, the first in more than 20
years of Israeli occupation.
   Robert Slater, president of the Foreign Press Association, said
it refused army offers of news pools, but U.S. television network
pools went into Gaza and the West Bank with an army escort.
   Israel radio said the army made mass roundups of Palestinians as
soon as the territories were closed, arresting 600.
   According to the Arab-run Palestine Press Service, 120 were
jailed under special powers permitting six months of detention
without trial. The army confirmed making mass arrests, but did not
give numbers.
   At West Bank roadblocks, troops turned away a U.N. official and
Save the Children director Chris George despite an army
announcement that the closure would not affect international relief
workers. The army refused comment.
   Both organizations said they would protest. ``It's a full-time
job now to raise our complaints with the Israeli authorities,''
said U.N. spokesman Bill Lee.
   George said half the 10 people on his agency's Jerusalem staff
were denied entry to the city.
   An AP reporter saw soldiers force merchants in Ramallah to close
their shops and confiscate the identity cards of some. The aim was
to break the authority of the Palestine Liberation Organization,
which ordered Arabs to open their stores for three hours daily.
   ``We won't allow another body to run things,'' military
government coordinator Shmuel Goren said on Israel television.
   Israeli troops forcibly closed major West Bank markets in
Jericho, Nablus, Jenin and Ramallah, as well as in Gaza City, said
Mona Rishmawi of Law in the Service of Man, a human rights group
founded by Palestinian lawyers.
   Said Kenaan, a Nablus businessman, said by telephone that the
army kept food trucks out of the city and, ``when stores tried to
open, troops threw food on the ground and destroyed it. I saw it
myself.''

   Workers stayed home again Tuesday in a region of
the Caucasus whose Armenian majority is trying to force the Soviet
bureaucracy to reverse a decision it made about local rule 65 years
ago.
   ``My report today will be short,'' Izvestia correspondent P.
Gutiontov wrote from Stepanakert, the largest city of the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh region. ``City enterprises are at standstill,
people are home.''
   About 75 percent of Nagorno-Karabakh's 157,000 people are ethnic
Armenians, but the Kremlin assigned it to neighboring Azerbaijan in
1923. Most Armenians are Christians. Azeris, the indigenous people
of Azerbaijan, are predominantly Moslem.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, also gave the first
breakdown of Armenian and Azeri casualties in Feb. 28 rioting in
the city of Sumgait in Azerbaijan, and denied reports that children
were killed.
   A curfew was imposed on Sumgait after the riots but Pravda, the
Communist Party daily, said it was lifted Tuesday because ``life in
the city ... has returned to normal.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news
briefing some workers in Stepanakert stayed home and ``certain
enterprises are not functioning or are partially not functioning.''
   Telephone calls to Stepanakert from Moscow did not go through or
were cut off.
   Izvestia also reported Monday that residents of Stepanakert
stayed home. Dissident sources say the strike began last week, but
their reports could not be confirmed.
   Soviet officials, who have announced a costly program to improve
social and economic conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh, will not bend
to pressure from activists to allow Armenia to annex the region,
Gerasimov said.
   ``We believe that problems have to be solved ... on the basis of
realism and without undue emotion,'' Gerasimov said. ``One cannot
solve these complex problems with demonstrations only.''
   ``We cannot solve the problem by mechanically transferring this
region as some Armenian officials want,'' he said. ``The more you
study this problem the more you will see the whole thing is not as
simple as that, as merely saying Nagorno-Karabakh must be part of
Armenia.''
   Gerasimov said the situation had improved but not enough for the
government to allow foreign journalists to travel there.
   Sporadic strikes and protests have been reported in
Nagorno-Karabakh since Feb. 13. The latest labor trouble is said to
have begun last Wednesday.
   Izvestia quoted investigators as confirming the previously
announced death toll of 32 in the Sumgait riot. It said 26 of them
were Armenians and six were from Azerbaijan. Previously, officials
had said the 32 dead were of various nationalities, and that the
rioting was not necessarily an ethnic dispute.
   Armenian activists had claimed the death toll was much higher
and that most of the dead were Armenians.
   ``It has been firmly established with evidence that during the
disorder in Sumgait not one child suffered,'' Izvestia quoted
investigators as saying. ``There were not 400 or 500 deaths, but
exactly 32 people, as said in a published statement by the Soviet
prosecutor. Included in these 32 were 26 Armenians and six
Azerbaijanis.''
   Armenian activists have claimed that small children were thrown
from the windows of maternity hospitals during the riot.
   Izvestia said the strike would not help Stepanakert residents,
and accused activists of lack of concern for the region's welfare.
   Its article Tuesday and a report it published Monday were part
of a new, more detailed look at the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.
   Soviet media are being encouraged under Communist Party chief
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost to be more open about
social problems, but initial reports on the Nagorno-Karabakh
dispute were slow in coming and lacked detail.
   Sovietskaya Kultura said Tuesday the government's plan for
Nagorno-Karabakh would cost about $640 million.
   ``These millions, which are so necessary now for restructuring,
the country is giving to Karabakh,'' it said in a front-page
article tracing the unrest to poor social and economic conditions.
   Moscow dissident Tamara Grigoryants said police broke up a
demonstration Monday evening in Yerevan, capital of Soviet Armenia,
by more than 50 people demanding freedom for jailed Armenian
activist Paryur Arikyan.
   She said they carried saying, ``We don't believe in
perestroika,'' a reference to Gorbachev's effort to restructure
Soviet society.

   The House Armed Services Committee voted deep
cuts Tuesday in President Reagan's request for Star Wars
anti-missile spending and his plan to put multiple-warhead MX
missiles on western railroads.
   The decision came shortly before the Democratic-controlled panel
voted 48-4 approval of a bill authorizing the Pentagon to spend
$299 billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   The overall Pentagon budget had been set in December during
negotiations between the White House and Congress over a budget
deficit reduction package.
   The panel slashed to $3.7 billion Reagan's request for $4.5
billion in Star Wars funds.
   The panel also voted to approve $500 million for research into
putting the MX aboard trains, $300 million less than Reagan had
sought. At the same time, the panel increased Reagan's request for
spending on the single-warhead Midgetman missile from $200 million
to $500 million.
   As it worked on the bill, the committee also:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Voted 43-8 to spend $1.4 billion for a new Trident submarine
instead of using the money for two more Aegis-class destroyers.
That vote reversed a decision last week by the seapower
subcommittee.
   _Voted 46-6 to permit the United States to sell Aegis-class
destroyers to Japan, as long as Reagan certifies that the system is
protected against espionage. Aegis is the Navy's secret, high-tech
defense system for ships and the administration is considering
selling four of the $1.2 billion ships to Japan.
   The Star Wars decision confirmed the budget choice made last
week by the Armed Services research and development subcommittee,
and will result in a deep reduction from original plans. The $3.7
billion figure would mean that Star Wars spending next year would
remain at about the current level.
   Last year, Pentagon budget plans called for seeking $6.2 billion
in Star Wars money for fiscal 1989, but that was reduced to the
$4.5 billion level by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci as part
of a package of reductions he ordered in response to a White
House-congressional agreement in December that set next year's
defense budget at $299 billion.
   That agreement has calmed the congressional debate about defense
spending, but opened new fights about how to best allocate the
overall total.
   The $3.7 billion figure for the Strategic Defense Initiative, as
Star Wars is known formally, was approved Tuesday after the
committee was unable to agree on four other proposed SDI amounts
ranging from $3.1 billion up to the full $4.5 billion figure.
   The committee later voted to overturn a decision by the research
and development subcommittee which had halved the Pentagon's SDI
budget request for research into an interceptor rocket that would
be used to slam into Soviet nuclear missiles at high speed to
destroy them.
   Known as the Space-Based Interceptor, the program is consuming
an increasingly large share of the Pentagon's SDI budget. Plans
next year call for spending $330 million on that program, but the
subcommittee had cut that in half because of fears that the
technology is not as promising as other weapons that could be part
of a defensive shield.
   The dispute over the Midgetman and the MX involves a pair of
nuclear weapons that have been central to a seven-year-old fight
over Reagan's plans for building up America's nuclear arsenal.
   Congress has approved building 50 of the MX weapons for
deployment in land-based silos, but the Pentagon is now seeking 50
more of the weapons and plans call for putting the second 50 aboard
trains. Meantime, the Pentagon has been lukewarm toward the
Midgetman, a weapon that has been a favorite of congressional
critics of the MX.
   Carlucci told Congress last month that he thought the Midgetman
should be eliminated, but said he had included $200 million at the
request of Congress so the program could be kept alive until
Reagan's successor makes a decision next year.
   Meantime, Carlucci said $800 million should be spent for
research into the rail-based version of the 10-warhead MX.
   The research and development subcommittee said last week that
each weapon should be given $500 million and that subcommittee
decision was ratified Tuesday after several unsuccessful attempts
to change it.

   Three bombs exploded within
minutes of each other Tuesday in three movie houses, spreading
panic in the downtown cinema district and injuring two federal
policemen and two other people, officials said.
   The officers were trying to deactivate one bomb when it exploded
in the second row of the Normandie Theater on Lavalle Street. Bombs
also hit the nearby Atlas Lavalle and Sarmiento theaters, police
said.
   A bomb was found at a fourth theater but experts defused it.
Three other movie houses received telephoned bomb threats but
searches turned up nothing, police said.
   The explosions caused panic along the street, which is reserved
for pedestrians only, Federal Police Chief Juan Angel Pirker said.
Theaters and businesses emptied. Ticket-takers ran into the street
shouting for ambulances.
   Leaflets scattered at one bombing site read ``O.A.S.-M.R.P.,''
initials of a group that claimed responsibility for most of the 18
bombings and bomb attempts in Argentina this year. It is not known
what the initials stand for.
   Hurt the worst in Tuesday's bombings was a police inspector who
had one hand blown off, officials at Churruca Hospital said. The
other policeman also was badly hurt, they said.
   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Two movie-goers, a man and a woman, were injured while watching
``The Last Emperor'' at the Atlas Lavalle, police said. The bomb
exploded near the front of the theater, where about 250 people were
seated.
   ``They (the bombers) placed the explosive devices in sites where
they knew there were going to be civilians injured,'' said Pirker.
   Similar O.A.S.-M.R.P. leaflets were scattered earlier this month
at the site of bombings in a downtown apartment building and a
Roman Catholic church. Some reports suggest the bombings stem from
a rightist terrorist group linked to rebel leader Aldo Rico, a
former lieutenant colonel.
   Last year, Rico led a brief Easter Week uprising at three army
camps. The mutineers demanded an end to prosecution of officers
accused of human rights abuses during the 1976-83 military regime.
   Rico and other leaders of that rebellion and a similar one in
January are held at Magdalena military prison, 60 miles south of
Buenos Aires.
   The Supreme Court meanwhile ordered freed four admirals accused
of human rights abuses under the military regime at the Naval
Mechanics School, a notorious detention center in northern Buenos
Aires.
   The court ruled the four were among about 270 officers with the
rank of brigadier general or below who could benefit from last
year's ``due obedience'' law passed by Congress. The law says only
top-ranked officers who ordered human rights crimes now face
prosecution, not those of lower rank who obeyed orders.
   At least 9,000 people vanished during the military regime's
``dirty war'' against suspected leftists, the government says.
   Raul Alfonsin was elected president in 1983, ending the
military's nearly eight-year rule.

   A convicted killer scheduled five times
to die for murdering a sheriff's deputy won another last-minute
reprieve Tuesday by a 6-3 vote of the U.S. Supreme Court, which has
heard but not decided a similar case.
   Attorneys for John Henry Selvage filed an appeal with the high
court a day after an appeals court Monday vacated a stay granted by
a federal judge.
   Selvage was sentenced to die for the shooting death of Harris
County Sheriff's Deputy Albert Garza, who was killed July 30, 1979
_ his 48th birthday. Garza was trying to prevent a Houston jewelry
store robbery but had not drawn his gun.
   The appeal covered several issues, but Selvage's strongest case
for a reprieve stemmed from his use of the same argument the
Supreme Court heard March 1 in Texas inmate Donald Gene Franklin's
case, said attorney David Cunningham.
   Franklin's attorney argued that Texas' capital punishment law
keeps jurors from giving full consideration to ``mitigating
circumstances'' suggesting life in prison as more appropriate than
the death penalty.
   The Supreme Court granted a stay of execution to the 37-year-old
Selvage after he was moved from death row at the Ellis I Unit
outside Huntsville to a cell near the death chamber at the Walls
Unit in Huntsville, Texas Department of Corrections spokesman
Charles Brown said.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices granted the stay pending action by
the court on a formal appeal by Selvage. The dissenters were Chief
Justice William H. Renquist and justices Byron R. White and Sandra
Day O'Conner.
   In February, another Texas inmate, Calvin Williams, won a stay
from the Supreme Court about 90 minutes before he was to be
executed. He used the same argument as in the Franklin case, which
the Supreme Court has not yet decided.
   The scheduling of Selvage's execution on Wednesday, shortly
after midnight, marked the fifth time Selvage faced lethal
injection. Each time he won stays.
   On Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans
vacated the stay granted to Selvage on Friday by U.S. District
Judge Norman Black of Houston.
   The Texas attorney general's office argued that Black should not
have granted a reprieve because the appellate court is
reconsidering the appeal of another death row inmate from Harris
County, Leon Rutherford King, who like Selvage questioned the
selection of jurors during his trial.

   Teachers' unions are ``standing in the
hallways and blocking up the doors of reform'' in places like
Chicago with troubled public schools, Secretary of Education
William J. Bennett said Tuesday.
   Bennett, who has said Chicago schools are in an ``education
meltdown,'' toured two public schools there last Wednesday at the
invitation of Jacqueline Vaughn, president of the Chicago Teachers
Union.
   Bennett said afterwards that ``two schools do not a system make.
Facts remain facts, and the evidence suggests very serious
problems.''
   Mrs. Vaughn responded that ``what stalls education reform are
not teachers or teachers' unions, but the cutbacks in funds from
his administration.
   ``Mr. Bennett appears to have a personal vendetta against our
union, because every time we challenge him to produce the so-called
facts he throws around, he insults us,'' she continued.
   In an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, Bennett
said teachers' unions have been an impediment to school reform in
some places.
   He said the American Federation of Teachers has been more open
to accountability and choice than its larger rival, the National
Education Association, but he said AFT affiliates like the one in
Chicago ``can be as intransigent and mindless as the NEA.''
   ``We sat there together in a press conference and I said, `Why
don't you admit what everybody knows, which is there are a lot of
teachers ... who have no business in being in classrooms?'''
Bennett said.
   He said Vaughn replied, ``We don't think there's such a thing as
an incompetent teacher. There's only a teacher in need of
assistance or help, a sabbatical or something.''
   Bennett called that ``just utter nonsense or drivel. But that's
the party line.''
   ``I was struck and kind of put off by the party line,'' he said.
``Every time I met with the Chicago Teachers Union, every time they
appeared, they appeared as a committee, and there were five or six
of them, and they would say these things which are obviously the
approved way of speaking. It was kind of scary.''
   ``They're standing in the hallways and blocking up the doors of
reform, as is the bureaucracy there. It's an urban school situation
and the children are suffering,'' he said.
   Bennett added that the ``intransigence of special interests''
such as teacher unions remains the biggest obstacle toward improved
schools.
   Mrs. Vaughn said Bennett's comments show he is ``uninterested in
fair and objective appraisals. Every system has good and bad in it,
but he seems to like to single out ours.''
   She also said the Chicago union had a history of proposing
innovative reforms.

   Solicitor General Charles Fried said Tuesday
the resignations of two top-level colleagues at the Justice
Department are leading him to reconsider his future in the Reagan
administration.
   ``This development implicates every sort of question,'' Fried
said in the second of two interviews with The Associated Press.
``The possibilities include my departure, or that this is just a
tempest in a teapot or many other things as well.''
   Fried, who represents the government in the Supreme Court, said
he learned about the resignations on Monday, the day before
Attorney General Edwin Meese was told.
   ``I got a heads-up, a courtesy call to let me know in advance,''
Fried said of the departures.
   Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns and Assistant Attorney
General William Weld, who heads the department's criminal division,
announced their resignations Tuesday. Two personal assistants to
each man also quit.
   Told that acquaintances had said he might join the pair in
leaving, Fried replied, ``They seem to know my mind better than I
do.''
   He said he was home with the flu on Tuesday and had a Supreme
Court argument scheduled Wednesday morning.
   ``I want to get through tomorrow and then I've got to think it
through,'' Fried said. ``I don't know the significance of these
departures.
   ``Once I get through tomorrow, I plan to think it through,'' he
said in the first interview.
   Fried, after the initial interview, called back to stress that
his departure was by no means the only possible outcome of his
deliberations.
   The 53-year-old former Harvard Law School professor became
solicitor general in late 1985, succeeding Rex Lee.
   Fried has been closely aligned with conservative legal theorists
who have risen to power under Meese.
   But one source familiar with events leading to the resignations
said Fried had been working with Burns on naming James M. Spears to
head the civil division earlier this month when they were surprised
to learn in a newspaper that Meese's ultra-conservative counselor
William Bradford Reynolds engineered the selection of another
department offcial, John Bolton, for the post.
   The resignations came amid a year-old criminal investigation of
Meese but there was nothing to link them directly to any new
developments in that probe, department sources said.
   One source said the precipitating factor at this time was an
internal fight over the successor to Stephen Trott as associate
attorney general, the department's No. 3 post.
   Burns unsuccessfully supported Weld for this post, according to
this source. Weld was unwilling to stay when he was passed over for
the promotion, in part because his two predecessors as criminal
division chiefs, Lowell Jensen and Trott, both had won the same
promotion.
   This source said Weld believed he was being punished for
disagreeing on legal issues with Meese and his top aides.
   Burns was angered to learn that Reynolds has gotten Meese's
private approval to name as associate attorney general Frank
Keating, the assistant Treasury secretary who supervises the
Customs Service and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Another department source said, however, these fights might not
have had so much significance were Meese not under the cloud of a
continuing criminal investigation.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted
12-6 Tuesday to approve a measure intended to bar future presidents
from changing the current U.S. view of the meaning of the
medium-range missile treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Rep. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., called the action ``a gratuitous
slap'' at President Reagan and said it might cause him and other
GOP treaty supporters to vote against the pact.
   In a separate development, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman
of the Foreign Relations panel, said another treaty problem has
been solved with administration assurances that the pact does ban
medium-range weapons based on such futuristic or exotic technology
as laser rays and particle beam generators.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee had identified the issue of
futristic weapons as one which had to be fully settled before the
full Senate acted on the pact.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate met in unusual secret session to
review conflicting intelligence estimates on the size of the Soviet
medium-range SS-20 missile force.
   But conservatives who called for the meeting to air claims that
the Soviets are hiding a large force of SS-20s, said few if any
minds had been changed about the merits of the new treaty
eliminating such nuclear weapons.
   The partisan dispute in the Foreign Relations Committee over the
meaning of treaty language stems from the controversy that
developed after the Reagan administration asserted in 1986 that a
new reading of the negotiating record of the 1972 Anti-ballistic
Missile or ABM Treaty permitted the deployment of a ``Star Wars''
strategic defense system despite the widely held view that the pact
banned ``exotic'' missile-defense systems.
   The Democratic sponsors of the language added by the committee
to the treaty said it would block future presidents from changing
the meaning of the pact on grounds that the Senate had not been
fully informed about the contents of the negotiating record or had
otherwise been misled.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., an outspoken opponent of the INF pact,
unexpectedly voted for the measure after Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., agreed to add language stating that a commonly accepted
treaty interpretation cannot be changed except by the Senate's
ratification of a subsequent treaty or by enactment of a law by
both houses of Congress.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., told reporters later he believed
Helms acted out of a ``devious'' strategy intended to prolong the
dispute and perhaps to torpedo the treaty itself.
   Helms denied that saying that in its previous form the measure
had been unconstitutional.
   Lugar also accused the Democratic sponsors of the proposal of
``a deliberate bid to embarrass the president,'' adding it is
certain to cause a fierce fight on the Senate floor.
   Evans told reporters: ``I think this has made it a partisan
situation. It's a gratuitous slap at the president.''
   ``No one has worked harder for this treaty than me,'' Evans
said. ``But now I'm going to seriously take a look as to whether I
will vote for it on the floor.''
   The secret session, the first held by the Senate since October
1986, was convened to discuss allegations the Soviets may try to
hide a covert force of more than 300 SS-20 medium-range missiles
after the treaty banning such weapons goes into effect.
   ``I think they heard some things they hadn't heard before,''
said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who has long pursued the theory that
the Soviet SS-20 force is far larger than the 650 missiles the
Soviets declare they have.
   But Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, told reporters: ``I would be
surprised if any minds were changed.''
   ``I don't know if it changed any minds,'' said Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., when asked to describe the three-hour secret
session held for security reasons in the Old Senate Chamber, last
used on a regular basis in 1859.
   ``The treaty has a political life which is in large part
independent of its own terms,'' Wallop said, adding that many
senators fear explosive political results inside the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization were the treaty to be denied Senate
ratification.
   ``The inadequacies of this treaty are probably tolerable for a
majority who feel that the political consequences in Europe far
outweigh concern about the failures and weaknesses in the treaty,''
Wallop said.
   Symms said he doubts if more than a dozen or so senators will
vote against the INF pact.
   But Symms, Wallop and other conservatives said the debate over
the medium-range missile treaty has set the stage for a far more
divisive and uncertain battle over a treaty making deep reduction
in intercontionental nuclear arms.
   ``INF is the appetizer for the main course, the START treaty,''
Symms said.
   START, an acronym for Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, would be
far more significant militarily and provide far more incentive for
the Soviets to cheat, Symms contended.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to vote
Wednesday on whether to send the medium-range missile pact to the
full Senate.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 18-2 on Monday to
recommend the treaty be approved.
   But in doing so it ignited a new controversy, declaring it was
not clear from the text of the treaty or the negotiating record
whether the accord covers futuristic, high-technology weapons such
as those using laser rays or particle beam generators.

   A judge on Tuesday sentenced an ex-Conrail
engineer to five years in prison for driving three locomotives into
the path of a passenger train, killing 16 people in Amtrak's worst
accident.
   Although Rick L. Gates, 33, of Essex, Md., admitted smoking
marijuana on the train before the Jan. 4, 1987 wreck, Baltimore
County Circuit Judge Joseph P. Murphy said he did not believe the
engineer was under the influence of the drug.
   ``But what he did in terms of failure to follow procedures was
to show us that he didn't give a damn. He just didn't care,'' the
judge said.
   Gates pleaded guilty Feb. 16 to a single misdemeanor
manslaughter count and admitted in a statement of facts to failing
to make several safety checks that might have prevented the
accident.
   ``I would like you to know I accept full responsibility,'' Gates
told the judge. ``I will never be able to forget.''
   Gates and family members in the courtroom wept as excerpts from
five statements from victims' relatives were read.
   In a plea bargain, 16 original misdemeanor charges of
manslaughter by locomotive were consolidated into a single charge,
reducing Gates' possible prison time from 80 years to five.
   Murphy also fined Gates the maximum $1,000. Gates was taken into
custody immediately after sentencing. He could be eligible for
parole after serving about 18 months, State's Attorney Sandra
O'Connor said.
   Mrs. O'Connor asked Murphy to sentence Gates to the maximum
allowable term, while his public defender, Donna Shearer, asked for
a two-year prison term, plus mandatory rehabilitation.
   The judge said, ``No matter what I do, we are at the mercy of
people who will simply not behave properly behind the wheel of an
automobile or at the stick of an airplane. There's nothing I can do
that will deter those people.''
   Prosecutors accepted the plea bargain after examining vehicular
manslaughter cases from several Maryland counties and finding that
none of the sentences were longer than five years, Mrs. O'Connor
said.
   Dr. Roger Horn, whose daughter Ceres was killed in the crash,
said he did not know what sentence would have been appropriate. He
said he was angry that no railroad safety legislation has been
approved by Congress since the crash. ``That crime is right up
there with Mr. Gates','' he said.
   Mrs. O'Connor said her office would join the victims' families
in lobbying the General Assembly next year to increase the severity
of the crime.
   Ms. Shearer said she was disappointed in the sentence but
doubted an appeal would be filed.
   More than 175 people were injured when Gates missed a track
signal and drove three linked Conrail locomotives in front of the
660-passenger Amtrak train traveling about 120 mph. The impact
trapped riders in the wreckage for hours in bitter cold.
   Gates was unhurt and his brakeman, Edward Cromwell, suffered a
broken leg.
   The plea bargain was announced just before a trial at which
Cromwell was expected to testify that he and Gates fabricated a
story to cover up their drug use on the train.
   Tests performed on blood samples taken from both men after the
accident showed traces of marijuana and possibly alcohol in their
systems, the National Transportation Safety Board said.
   A January ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
against post-crash drug testing is under appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

<HEAD>Bush Won't Have Delegates Needed To Nominate For A Few More Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although Vice President George Bush is running
virtually alone for the Republican presidential nomination, it will
be at least a couple of weeks before he can gain enough delegates
for a majority at the GOP convention.
   Going into Tuesday's primary in Connecticut, Bush had 788 of the
1,139 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination. Another
250 delegates, most of whom are the remnants of the presidential
campaigns of Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. Jack Kemp, now are counted as
uncommitted.
   If Bush were to pick up all of those delegates, he still would
be 101 short of the number needed to win the nomination.
   The Connecticut primary could give Bush 35 delegates and he
could gain 47 more next week in Wisconsin. Minnesota holds the next
Republican event yielding national convention delegates when the
party there holds its state convention on April 15.
   That convention, where 24 delegates are at stake, would be the
earliest opporunity for Bush to go over the top.
   However, if Bush gains none of the currently uncommitted
delegates, his road to the nomination will be a bit longer.
Assuming he wins every delegate that can be won from now on, Bush
would cross the threshold on May 3, when Ohio, Indiana and the
District of Columbia hold their primaries.
   Bush's only challenger is former television evangelist Pat
Robertson, who has 17 delegates and has all but quit campaigning.

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Oscar Arias met Tuesday
with three Guatemalan guerrilla leaders and said he would try to
help arrange new negotiations between Guatemala's government and
leftist rebels.
   He told reporters after the meeting that he would intercede with
President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala to see if negotiations could
be resumed.
   ``It has been proven that peace and democracy can be reached
through dialogue,'' Arias said.
   Cerezo's government and the rebels held their only peace talks
in 27 years of fighting last October in Madrid, Spain.
   Those negotiations were in line with the peace plan signed in
Guatemala in August by the presidents of the five Central American
countries _ Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Honduras. Arias was the author of the plan and was awarded the 1987
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Arias met for more than an hour with rebel leaders Rodrigo
Asturias, Luis Becker and Hector Nuila. Asturias is the son of
Miguel Angel Asturias, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1971.
   Asturias told reporters the rebels proposed another negotiating
session to be held in Costa Rica next month with Archbishop
Prospero Penados del Barrio, the Roman Catholic prelate of
Guatemala, as mediator.
   Penados del Barrio agreed earlier this year to the guerrillas'
proposal that he serve as mediator, but Cerezo's government has
rebuffed calls for a resumption of the talks.
   ``We place no conditions on these talks, instead we offer an
open agenda to discuss the problems of Guatemala and from there
look for a political solution for our country, with the
participation of all social sectors,'' Asturias told a news
conference.
   He is a commander of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary
Union, a coalition of three guerrilla groups that claim a total of
3,500 combatants.
   The Central American peace plan calls for cease-fires in the
regional conflicts, democratic reforms, amnesties for political
prisoners and a ban on outside military assistance.

   While the Arizona Senate heard testimony
about an allegedly improper loan to Gov. Evan Mecham's car
dealership, the governor's son announced Tuesday that the family
has been forced to sell the business to avert financial ruin.
   ``The confusion and questions this avalanche of negative
publicity has caused ... has forced my family to come to this
decision to sell Mecham Pontiac while the condition of the company
remains solvent and salable,'' Dennis Mecham told a news conference
at the dealership in suburban Glendale.
   Dennis Mecham said sales have decreased dramatically for over a
year as the result of Mecham's political battle and its effect on
consumers. The dealership was sold for about $4 million to a
neighboring auto dealer, he said.
   Dennis Mecham testified last week that the Mecham car dealership
was on sure footing last July when his father arranged an $80,000
loan to the business from a protocol fund. The prosecution has
sought to show that Mecham Pontiac was in desperate straits and
needed the money. The governor denies this.
   Prosecutors said the sale would have no effect on Mecham's
impeachment tral at this time.
   Mecham attorney Jerris Leonard said he was sure Mecham would
reap ``a substantial amount of money'' from the sale although not
as much if he had sold before the political crisis.
   Leonard rested his case late Tuesday on the $80,000 loan count,
and the prosecution said it would call at least one rebuttal
witness before closing its evidence on the charge Wednesday.
   Senators then would decide whether to vote on Mecham's guilt or
innocence of the two charges already considered or move on to
evidence on the third and last count.
   Meanwhile, a defense witness who testified that the $80,000 loan
was ``legal but stupid,'' was threatened with contempt of court.
   The warning to political consultant and lawyer Robert L'Ecuyer
from presiding officer Frank X. Gordon came at Mecham's impeachment
trial as L'Ecuyer tried to blunt a piercing cross-examination by
reading sections of another witness' earlier testimony about which
he had not been questioned.
   L'Ecuyer continued his discourse even after Gordon, the chief
justice of the Arizona Supreme Court, ruled him out of order.
   ``Mr. L'Ecuyer,'' you see this thing in my hand?'' Gordon asked,
pointing his gavel at the witness.
   ``I have been a judge for 26 years, sir. I have never had to rap
this gavel and find a lawyer in contempt but you are tempting me.''
   ``I am properly admonished,'' said L'Ecuyer.
   Earlier, L'Ecuyer was admonished for trying to read a lengthy
statement to defuse a prosecution disclosure that he had been
reprimanded by the Arizona Bar for unethical conduct in 1979 and
voluntarily stopped practicing law for three years.
   He admitted that he improperly borrowed $5,500 from a client's
trust fund which he said was in lieu of his fee.
   ``And your defense was that you were borrowing at a higher rate
of interest than it could otherwise get?'' prosecutor Paul Eckstein
asked to laughter from the gallery.
   Part of Mecham's defense on the charge that he misused the
protocol fund by loaning $80,000 to his Mecham Pontiac dealership
was that he borrowed the money at a higher rate of interest than it
was receiving at the bank.
   Asked by Mecham lawyer Jerris Leonard whether he knew of any law
that made the governor's loan illegal, L'Ecuyer replied: ``I know
of no such law.''
   L'Ecuyer testified, ``I told the governor when I found out that
it was stupid. I thought it was legal but stupid.''
   Mecham contends the protocol fund was not public money because
it was raised by his inaugural committee to pay off campaign debts.
   When state law barred that use, the money was placed in a fund
for such uses as the governor's trips and entertainment to promote
Arizona's image.
   L'Ecuyer, who was hired by Mecham to analyze laws relating to
the public funds issue, said, he concluded that the money raised by
the inaugural committee remained private and in Mecham's control.
   ``The status of the funds is they are purely private funds of a
private unincorporated organization in that association's bank
account,'' he said.
   Eckstein noted that the chairman of Mecham's inaugural
committee, William Long, has said his committee ceased to exist
after its funds were transferred into the protocol fund.
   L'Ecuyer said he felt Long was not qualified to make that
decision, which he said he considered a legal opinion.
   Mecham, who testified earlier this week on the loan charge, also
is accused of thwarting investigation of an alleged death threat on
a grand jury witness and concealing a $350,000 campaign loan.
   The campaign loan, for which Mecham faces felony charges and a
criminal trial April 21, is scheduled to become the focus of the
impeachment trial later this week.
   On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Ryan
rejected two defense motions to dismiss charges against Mecham in
the criminal case.
   The defense had claimed Mecham was being selectively prosecuted
and prosecuted under the wrong law. The judge also refused to
separate Mecham's case from that of a co-defendant, his brother
Willard, who was his 1986 campaign treasurer.
   Mecham, the first U.S. governor impeached in six decades, also
faces a recall election May 17.

   The investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co. stirred up the waters around Texaco Inc. on Tuesday, saying it
will seek federal approval to acquire up to 15 percent of the oil
giant's stock.
   Kohlberg Kravis, which has carried out some of the largest
leveraged buyouts in U.S. history, said an affiliate already has
acquired 11.95 million Texaco shares, or about 4.9 percent of the
roughly 242 million shares outstanding.
   A statement said the shares had been purchased ``some months ago
in the open market.''
   At its the White Plains, N.Y., headquarters, Texaco's response
was upbeat.
   ``Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has in past situations demonstrated an
ability to be a constructive shareholder, which recognizes the
importance of building value for the long term,'' the company said
in a statement. ``We have no indication that their intentions with
Texaco are any different.''
   Kohlberg Kravis directed queries to Kekst and Co., a public
relations firm, where Ruth Pachman declined further comment.
   Investors responded enthusiastically to Kohlberg Kravis's
anouncement. In nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, Texaco jumped $3.25 a share from the
previous day's close, to $48.
   Kohlberg Kravis became the fourth party to express interest in
Texaco, which is to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
reorganization early next month.
   Financier Carl C. Icahn is the White Plains, N.Y.-based
company's largest shareholder, holding 14.8 percent of its shares.
   Oilman T. Boone Pickens also has sought federal regulatory
permission to buy up to 15 percent of Texaco's shares.
   In addition, Getty Petroleum Co., an independent marketer of
petroleum products that was born of Texaco's 1984 Getty Oil Co.
acquisition, has made a similar filing.
   The Texaco-Getty Oil deal started the nation's third largest oil
company on the road to bankruptcy court.
   In November 1985 a Houston jury ruled Texaco had improperly
interfered with a move by Houston-based Pennzoil Co. to acquire
part of Getty, then bought Getty itself. The jury awarded Pennzoil
$10.53 billion in damages.
   While the figure was reduced by $2 billion on appeal, it still
stood at $10.3 billion, including interest, when Texaco filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last April.
   The company said it was forced to do so to avoid having to post
an $11 billion bond while appealing the Houston jury's decision.
   Last week, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge approved a
reorganization plan that will bring Texaco out of Chapter 11
protection. As part of that plan, Pennzoil agreed to accept a $3
billion payment to settle its damage claim.

   House negotiators reached ``agreement in
principle'' late Tuesday on a $50 million package of humanitarian
aid for Nicaragua's Contra rebels and for children injured in that
country's civil war.
   As part of the deal, Speaker Jim Wright would agree to give
``fair'' consideration to any future request President Reagan might
make for new military aid for the rebels if the peace process
should break down, said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.
   The package was worked out in a negotiating session between
Wright and House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., and final
details were to be approved by both sides at a meeting Wednesday
morning.
   The Rules Committee late Tuesday approved ground rules for
bringing the package to the floor on Wednesday and approval by a
bipartisan majority was expected, if no further snags developed.
   ``I think we have an agreement in principle,'' said Rep. Dick
Cheney, R-Wyo.
   The tentative agreement would send about $2.7 million monthly in
food, clothing, medicine and shelter to the rebels over the next
six months. Communications gear and other expenses would push the
total six-month rebel aid package to $20 million, said Bonior
leader of a Democratic task force on the Contra issue.
   An identical ammount would go into a new program to care for
children injured in the seven-year civil war, he said.
   It also would provide $10 million to finance a verification
commission to ensure adherence to a cease-fire worked out last week
between the Contras and the leftist Managua government. Not
included in the $50 million total is additional money to transport
the aid.
   The money would be administered by the State Department's Agency
for International Development, Bonior said.
   In addition, Wright, D-Texas, would write a letter to Reagan and
Michel assuring the president of a chance to submit a proposal for
new military aid if the peace process becomes derailed.
   The Speaker would promise ``fair'' treatment of such a package,
but would retain control over the precise timing of any final vote
and the rules under which the package would be considered, Bonior
said. The verification commission would also have ``a substantial
say'' in whether new military aid is justified, he said.
   Republicans have said they do not trust the Sandinistas to
fulfill promises made as part of the 60-day cease-fire agreement
reached in talks with the rebels last week at Sapoa, Nicaragua.
They had wanted a guaranteed speedy vote in Congress on future
military aid to put pressure on Managua to live up to those
agreements, which include amnesty and restoration of civil
liberties.
   Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the amounts
mentioned were agreeable to the administration.
   ``The issue is not money but how fast we can get it'' to help
assure the survival of the Contra rebels as a fighting force, he
said. ``We want it as fast as we can get it.''
   The money would keep supplies flowing to the rebels as they wait
out the continuing negotiations over a long-term truce while based
in cease-fire zones inside Nicaragua. The aid would flow at a rate
comparable to that provided before Feb. 29, when the last U.S.
support ran out.
   Any new aid for the Contras would have to conform to the
requirements of the cease fire reached last week. That agreement
said the Contras would receive only humanitarian aid and that the
aid would be routed through ``neutral organizations.'' The CIA has
delivered past U.S. aid supplies to the rebels.

   The pro-apartheid Conservative
Party extended its series of recent political victories by winning
a special election Tuesday to fill a vacant seat in Parliament's
white House of Assembly.
   Conservative candidate Corne Mulder received 8,437 votes to
4,726 for Boy Geldenhuys of the governing National Party in the
balloting in rural Randfontein district.
   The seat became vacant Jan. 13 when Mulder's father, Connie
Mulder, died of heart and kidney failure. The elder Mulder had
captured the seat for the Conservatives in the national whites-only
election last May.
   Tuesday's lopsided vote was a further indication of the
Conservative Party's growing support, especially among rural whites.
   President P.W. Botha's National Party holds 133 seats in the
whites' 178-seat House of Assembly, Conservatives 23 and the
anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party 17 with five seats held by
minor parties or independents.
   There are three separate chambers in the white-dominated
Parliament, with the mixed-race chamber having 78 seats and the
Asian chamber 45.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   The Conservatives won two special parliamentary elections on
March 2 in rural white districts similar to Randfontein, which is
50 miles west of Johannesburg.
   In the national elections in May the Conservatives won 26
percent of the votes and they are expected to gain ground on the
National Party in nationwide municipal elections in October. The
National Party has governed South Africa since 1948.
   The Conservatives oppose all concessions to the black majority
and say Botha is capitulating to blacks and international pressure.
   Botha's party has said it seeks gradual race reform that
eventually would give blacks a say in national politics, but with
the whites maintaining ultimate control.
   The Progressive Federal Party has been losing support in recent
years and did not enter a candidate in Tuesday's election.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson drew one in five white votes
Tuesday in Connecticut's Democratic primary, far more than in 1984
but too few to deny Gov. Michael Dukakis a big win, exit polls said.
   Jackson's white support, up from about 5 percent four years ago,
was bolstered by a nearly unanimous black vote, WNBC-TV and ABC
News polls said. WNBC said Jackson drew 18 percent of the white
vote; ABC said 22 percent.
   But WNBC reported only one-fifth of the Connecticut Democrats
said the nation was ready to elect a black president, and ABC found
that a third of Democrats said they would abandon the party and
vote for George Bush if Jackson were nominated.
   ABC poll analyst John Brennan noted that Jackson's share of the
white vote was about the same in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and
greater in Vermont early this month, before Jackson's victory
Saturday in the Michigan caucuses.
   ``There's been a misconception that Jackson has made some kind
of substantial breakthrough with the white vote,'' Brennan said.
``I don't think that's happened.''
   Both the ABC and WNBC polls said Jackson's white backers were
mostly liberal and well-educated, rather than blue-collar workers.
   Dukakis, the governor of neighboring Massachusetts, won all
demographic groups except blacks, and 60 percent of the Democrats,
including a third of those who voted for Jackson, said they believe
he will be the nominee.
   But the NBC poll of 1,700 voters also found some weakness in
Dukakis' support: 45 percent of those who voted for him said they
wished there were other candidates running, said poll director
Laurily Epstein.
   ``There's good news for him; he's swept all groups except
blacks,'' she said in a telephone interview. ``But there's
disquieting news in that it's not enthusiastic support.''
   The ABC poll, however, found that 79 percent of the Democrats
said they would vote for Dukakis if he were the nominee against
Bush; only 52 percent of Democrats said they would vote for Jackson
if he were nominated, and 33 percent said the nomination of Jackson
would cause them to back the Republican.
   NBC said there was a hint of trouble for Bush: Forty percent of
Republican voters did not think he has told the full story of the
Iran-Contra affair, and they tended to support him less strongly,
Epstein said.
   ``Among those for whom it's an issue, it's hurting him,'' an
indication of a potential trouble spot in the general election, she
said.
   Still, Bush was viewed favorably by 75 percent of the Republican
voters and unfavorably by 18 percent, the WNBC poll said. Dukakis
had the best such rating among Democrats, 70 percent favorable to
10 percent unfavorable.
   Jackson was viewed favorably by about half the Democratic voters
and unfavorably by a third, while Gore was viewed favorably by 40
percent and unfavorably by a quarter. Only one in seven Gore
supporters think he will be the party's nominee, WNBC said.
   Jackson improved his showing among black Democrats as well as
whites, winning 90 percent of the black vote compared to 69 percent
in 1984, NBC said. Though just 20 percent of Democrats said the
nation is ready to elect a black president, that was up from 10
percent in 1984.
   ABC polled 1,277 voters in Connecticut; Brennan said the margin
of sampling error was about 5 percentage points. WNBC's was about 3
points.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, who finished behind regional
favorite Michael Dukakis in Tuesday's Connecticut primary, will
meet Wednesday with the front rank of Washington's Democratic
establishment in a summit session.
   The meeting comes one day after Democratic rival Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. criticized him sharply for a ``complete and total lack''
of the experience needed to be president.
   Gore took the negative tack Tuesday in a departure from the
general practice of Jackson opponents avoiding public criticism of
him.
   Dukakis, who regained his delegate lead over Jackson with his
nearly 2-1 Connecticut win, refused on Tuesday to say anything
negative about the civil rights leader.
   And the most prominent non-candidate, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
said it was wrong to talk of a ``Stop Jackson'' movement.
   Jackson arrived in Washington late Tuesday to begin a series of
private meetings with leading figures in the party's establishment
_ which has been in turmoil since his smashing victory over Dukakis
in the Michigan caucuses over the weekend.
   Facing the possibility that Jackson could win the presidential
nomination and be the first black ever to head the ticket,
Democrats have been keeping telephone lines busy with private
conversations about what the party's course should be.
   Exit polls indicated Jackson drew one in five white votes
Tuesday in Connecticut's Democratic primary, far more than in 1984
but too few to stop Dukakis from rolling up a big win. He won a
nearly unanimous black vote, according to polls by ABC and WNBC-TV
in New York.
   But WNBC said only one-fifth of all Democrats said the nation
was ready to elect a black president, and ABC found that a third of
Democrats said they would abandon the party and vote for George
Bush if Jackson were nominated.
   The Washington meeting Wednesday was set up by John White, a
former party chairman, even before the Michigan caucuses.
   ``Jackson showed an interest in meeting with the party regulars
and talking about the parts of the political world he might not be
familiar with,'' White said.
   Invited for the breakfast are such big Washington names as Clark
Clifford, Sol Linowitz, Harry McPherson, Richard Moe and Clifford
Alexander.
   ``This did not start out as a summit,'' said Ann Lewis, an
adviser to Jackson. ``The original idea was to get Jesse together
with the Washington establishment ... to listen to them talk about
issues and policies and then to answer any questions they might
have about him.''
   Also on hand will be state Democratic officials. Charles
Whitehead, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, confirmed he
will attend.
   White strongly condemned any notion this meeting was designed to
slow down Jackson's campaign with appeals concerning the greater
good of the party.
   ``It would be a serious, serious mistake for this party for
anybody to participate in a Stop Jackson movement,'' White said.
   As the meetings were slated, the attacks on Jackson began.
   In New York, Gore went sharply negative on the other Southerner
in the race.
   ``I have sharp disagreements with Jesse Jackson,'' the Tennessee
senator said. ``I (have) talked about his complete and total lack
of experience in the national government. He hasn't served a single
day in the national government, or had a single day's experience in
foreign policy.''
   Answering questions after a speech to the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Gore denied that
he has been afraid to criticize Jackson and took him on on the
Middle East.
   ``I also cannot disagree more with Jesse Jackson's views on many
foreign policy issues,'' Gore said. ``I categorically reject his
notion that there's a moral equivalance between Israel and the PLO.
... And I am dismayed by his embrace of Arafat and Castro.''
   In contrast, Dukakis would not criticize Jackson in any way,
refusing to answer a question on whether he considers Jackson
qualified to be president.
   ``I'm not going to comment on that. That's something the people
of this country are going to have to decide,'' Dukakis said while
campaigning in Connecticut. ``In the last analysis, they're going
to have to decide which one of us, of all the candidates, has the
strength, the values and the experience to lead this country.''
   He also refused to outline any differences on issues with
Jackson, something he has done repeatedly with the other candidates.
   ``That is a question which I have consistently refused to
answer. Because what I'm going to do is to take my message to the
American people positively, confidently, with hope, with
optimism,'' Dukakis said. ``I assume he will do the same and the
other candidates will do the same. The more positive the tone of
the campaign, as far as I'm concerned, the better _ for all of us
and for the ultimate goal, which is the election of a progressive
Democrat.''
   Cuomo said the Democratic party is not in a quandary if Jackson
becomes the first black man ever to head the national ticket.
   ``I reject the suggestion that it somehow presents us with a
dilemma if Jesse Jackson wins,'' said the New York Democrat. ``As
I've said before, the person who gets the most votes should be the
candidate and all talk of introducing somebody to stop Gore, to
stop Dukakis or to stop Jackson, that's all equally wrong.''
   Cuomo had a one-word answer to the question of whether Jackson
could win the general election: ``Yes.''
   Jackson's victory in Michigan put a new focus on the meetings on
Wednesday.
   ``The meeting has ballooned in size and importance,'' Lewis
said, after Jackson's Michigan victory.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Paul Kirk, who recently
praised Jackson for his positive campaign style and message, was
not part of the group of mostly former party officials who were
invited.
   There was speculation in Washington that some of the party
leaders' objective in meeting with Jackson was to tell him they do
not believe he could win the general election if he were nominated.
   Lewis ridiculed that notion, saying that Jackson had asked for
the meeting. She said that such speculation comes from those not
invited to the meeting and who do not understand the current
political situation.

   A group that sponsors meetings for
recovering alcoholics voted against buying an abandoned schoolhouse
Tuesday after wary Park Township officials imposed nearly two dozen
restrictions.
   The rules would have prohibited members from gathering outside
on the 4-acre property, which includes soccer and softball fields
and a playground, and would have limited the number of cars on the
premises to 35.
   Those two stipulations were the ones most bothersome to the
Holland Alano Association, said spokesman Donald Hann.
   ``We cannot and we will not turn away people seeking help
because they happen to arrive in the 36th car,'' said Hann, whose
association provides meeting space for 250 to 300 people in six
groups, including Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon.
   Directors of the non-profit organization had planned to buy the
former Ventura School, a vacant four-room building in a rural area
six miles north of Holland, because its lease on a decaying
warehouse expires May 1.
   ``The Holland Alano Association finds it impossible to purchase
the Ventura School because of the onerous and unfair restrictions
placed on the use of the premises by the Parkship Township Planning
Commission,'' the group said in a statement after meeting Tuesday
night.
   The rules, which included a ban on alcoholic beverages and
``mood altering substances,'' were imposed Monday night by the
Ottawa County township's planning commission on a special-use
permit sought by the association.
   Several homeowners had contended the presence of the
organization would destroy the peaceful character of their
neighborhood.
   ``I still don't feel it belongs in a quiet residential area,''
said Carol VanIwaarden. ``It's too bad. They need a place to go and
they are a necessary organization, but they should be in an area
where there's more activity.''
   Hann said the Alano Association must begin searching for a new
building immediately.
   ``We thought an abandoned schoolhouse in the country would be
ideal for us, but I guess we were wrong,'' he said.

   Vice President George Bush, given a
lock on the Republican presidential nomination by the withdrawal of
Sen. Bob Dole and bolstered by a big win in his boyhood home state
of Connecticut, declared: ``The immediate task ahead is unity.''
   ``Now is the time for all of us to join together and unify the
party,'' Bush told a campaign rally after learning of Dole's
announcement. Later, learning of his lopsided win in Connecticut,
he said: ``Let's get together, keep together and get to work.''
   The Kansas senator dropped out of the race earlier in the day in
Washington, pledging to ``do all I can to elect Republican in
November and doing all I can for our nominee, George Bush.''
   ``It's been a hard-fought campaign and I respect the tenacity of
Bob Dole,'' Bush said.
   The vice president said he had called Dole in Washington to
thank him for the ``very generous statement.''
   ``He was a tough competitor and I wanted to congratulate him on
a hard-fought race,'' Bush said.
   Bush also said Dole's departure from the campaign ``changes some
of the dynamics. It removes some of the tension.'' He added, ``I
don't like running against other Republicans.''
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson has indicated he has
no plans to withdraw from the GOP race, but he has only 17
delegates _ to Bush's nearly 800 _ and is no longer actively
campaigning in most states.
   Dole's withdrawal came as Bush was headed toward overwhelming
victory in Tuesday's GOP primary in Connecticut, and as he
campaigned in Wisconsin where he had been expected to easily
dominate Dole in this state's April 5 primary.
   Bush said he intended to continue cmapaigning in states with key
primaries, mentioning California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York.
   Overall, however, ``the schedule will be somewhat lighter and
I'll have more time to flesh out the issue positions,'' Bush said.
   He denied that there had been animosity between him and Dole.
``I don't feel that way, never have.'' he told reporters.
   Although Bush's camp was clearly elated at the development, one
top Bush supporter, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, said that Dole's
exit could hurt Bush's chances in the long run.
   ``I can't see the fact that the vice president doesn't have any
more opposition is that good for him. It's good to have a
primary,'' said Thompson, speaking to reporters on Air Force Two.
``Those individuals who come out of a hotly contested primary can
use it as a springbord to solidify the party,'' Thompson said.
   Bush faced hecklers and students chanting, ``just say no'' as he
addressed an audience at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis.
``This is nothing. This is small bore stuff. A preview of the
Democratic convention that is about to come,'' Bush told the
college audience.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church on Tuesday
called for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to resign and offered to act
as a mediator between the strongman and opponents demanding his
ouster.
   A church spokesman said Archbishop Marcos A. McGrath had talked
with both sides and received ``a positive impression'' that a
solution could be found to the agonizing crisis that has gripped
Panama for more than a month.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   _A general strike continued for the ninth day, with shopowners
keeping their stores closed despite a violent crackdown against
government opponents on Monday.
   _The U.S. helicopter carrier Okinawa passed through the Panama
Canal on its way to its home port in San Diego. The U.S. Defense
Department described the passage as ``routine.'' But Noriega called
the passage ``a threat and an agression.''
   _Noriega said in a speech Tuesday night that he would not be
vanquished by what he said was an imperialist plot against him.
   _In Washington, Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, speaking on
behalf of ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, asked the United
States to send a military force to remove Noriega, head of the
Defense Forces. ``We're asking the international community to
help,'' Sosa said. ``We're paying the price. But we've got no
weapons. Give us weapons.''
   The call for Noriega's resignation marked the first time the
church had made its stance public. Last week, church officials
privately urged Noriega, under indictment in the United States on
drug trafficking charges, to step down.
   On Monday, troops firing shotguns, tear gas and water cannon
smashed a demonstration by thousands of anti-government marchers in
Panama City.
   Afterward, troops raided the Marriott Hotel, which serves as the
headquarters of Panama's opposition and the foreign press.
   About 20 opposition leaders and ten foreign journalists were
arrested. The journalists and most of the opposition leaders were
released Tuesday although Carlos Gonzalez de la Lastra, a founder
and director of the National Civic Crusade, was still missing.
   The crusade is a coalition of about 200 business, professional,
labor and political groups that has been seeking Noriega's removal
since last June.
   President Reagan's chief spokesman expressed outrage at Monday's
action by Noriega's troops.
   ``We are all angry at this latest demonstration, at people being
beaten and threatened,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, adding
that the Noriega regime ``is showing its true colors.''
   The United States has imposed sanctions on Panama's government
and supported efforts by Delvalle to freeze Panamanian funds in
U.S. banks.
   Eight of the foreign journalists arrested Monday night were
taken to a military intelligence center in Panama City and held for
three hours. Two other journalists _ Ignacio Medrano of CBS and NBC
cameraman Domingo Rex of Mexico City _ were arrested separately,
witnesses said.
   Noriega told a ``Solidarity with Panama'' conference Tuesday
night that the United States had spent more than $100 million in
the effort to topple him.
   ``But with all the gold in the world they have not been able to
bring this people or this commander or these Defense Forces to
their knees,'' he said, shaking his fist to wild applause.
   Delegates from about 25 Latin American and Caribbean countries
attended the conference, but few represented governments.
   A spokeswoman at the marine traffic office of the Panama Canal
said the helicopter carrier Okinawa passed through the canal
Tuesday afternoon and was anchored at Rodman Naval Base, a U.S.
facility. She said she did not know whether it was loading or
unloading anything.
   The church agreed to intercede in Panama's crisis at the request
of President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain, and former presidents Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela and Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica.
   Monsignor Oscar Brown, the auxiliary bishop of Panama City, said
McGrath received their request Monday and immediately began
contacting ``all the parties involved,'' including Noriega and
opposition leaders.
   But Brown noted that the opposition demonstration was broken up
``in the precise moments when we were pursuing the first steps of
this initiative.''
   He said representatives of the Civic Crusade ``who have been
contacted have responded favorably.''
   In a statement to reporters during Brown's news conference, the
church said a committee of bishops met with Noriega on Thursday and
asked him to resign.
   Last month, Noriega engineered Delvalle's dismissal and
installed a new chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma. The Civic
Crusade and the United States continue to recognize Delvalle as
Panama's legitimate president.
   Earlier Tuesday, Ricardo Arias Calderon, the president of the
opposition Christian Democratic Party, said the government had
reacted to the request for church mediation ``as if it just doesn't
give a damn.''
   Referring to Monday's violence, Arias Calderon said, ``they are
responding to this initiative by simply going ahead in their
repressive manner and doing it dramatically so nobody misses the
point.''

<HEAD>Latin America Urges U.S. To End Economic Blockade of Panama</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Latin America urged the United States
on Tuesday to end its economic blockade of Panama, while
encouraging Panama at the same time to make its democracy more
effective.
   The 26 member nations of the Latin American Economic System
ended a two-day emergency conference, convened at Panama's request,
by condemning the U.S. economic measures as contrary to
international law and the charters of the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.
   The nations said they were opposed to foreign intervention in
Panama and asked Washington to honor a treaty which turns full
control of the Panama Canal over to Panama in 1999.
   ``We urge the U.S. government to revoke immediately the coercive
measures it has adopted against Panama,'' organization members said
in a final three-page communique released late Tuesday.
   ``We reaffirm the sovereign right of all nations to decide their
own economic, social and political destiny in peace and liberty,
free from foreign pressure, aggression and threats.''
   The organization, based in Caracas, was founded in 1976 as an
economic forum for Latin American countries.
   U.S. economic action against Panama is aimed at forcing the
removal of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as chief of his nation's
Defense Forces and as de facto ruler of Panama. Noriega is under
indictment in the United States as a drug trafficker and
money-launderer, charges he denies.
   The Reagan administration has imposed economic sanctions and has
backed moves by former Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle to
freeze Panamanian accounts in U.S. banks. The United States still
recognizes Delvalle as president, although he was ousted by Noriega.
   The Latin American Economic System ``took note'' of a promise by
Panama to ``deepen its democratic system.''
   The group said a request for economic aid by Panama's
cash-starved government will be considered ``with a spirit of
solidarity'' by Economic System members.
   Individual delegates clearly separated their support for the
principle of self-determination from their position regarding
Noriega.
   ``We have not come to defend a regime, or even less a person who
has been insubordinate to civil and constitutional authority,''
Peru's foreign minister, Allan Wagner, told delegates Tuesday.
   ``Our solidarity is with the people of Panama.''
   He called for an end to Panama's political crisis ``through free
elections and the removal of any obstacles that prevent this clear
expression of the will of the people of Panama.''
   Foreign Minister Jorge Abadia Arias of Panama said Monday his
nation was ``fully committed to deepening Panama's democratic
system.''
   Mexico and Venezuela were among the individual nations Monday
that indicated their opposition to outside interference in Panama's
affairs, without specifically mentioning the United States by name.

   More than two dozen Kurds burned on their faces,
backs and hands from reported Iraqi poison gas attacks that killed
5,000 were flown to four European countries and the United States
on Tuesday for treatment.
   Some coughed violently, others lay motionless on stretchers as
they were taken from an Iran Air ambulance plane that touched down
in Austria, Switzerland, West Germany and Britain.
   One 6-year-old child, said by Iranian and Kurdish officials to
have lost her entire family in an attack, sobbed constantly and
called for her parents. At least four other children were among the
wounded.
   The plane, dropping off six patients each in Vienna, Geneva,
Frankfurt and London, arrived in New York later Tuesday with five
wounded. The man, woman and three girls were taken to St. John's
Episcopal Hospital in Queens, where they were admitted in stable
condition, hospital spokesman Jim Wellen said.
   He said they suffered from skin and eye wounds, burns and
inhalation injuries.
   Swiss Red Cross President Felix Christ said the Iranian
goverment was paying for the medical treatment.
   Iran said the Iraqi air force dropped cyanide and mustard gas
bombs on three Kurdish towns in Iraq, killing 5,000 Kurds and
injuring 5,000 other people. The attacks first targeted the town of
Halabja, which had been captured by Iran, on March 16. Some
chemical bombs reportedly hit the nearby villages of Khormal and
Dojaila during the next few days. Most victims were in Halabja.
   Dr. Gerhard Freilinger, department head of Vienna's University
Clinic for plastic surgery, said the patients he talked to appeared
to have been injured by mustard gas that may have been mixed with a
nerve gas.
   It was possible the mustard gas was ``in combination with a
light nerve gas, because they all have bad headaches, are dizzy and
(some) may have been unconscious,'' he told reporters in Vienna.
   Mustard gas causes changes in the lungs that can lead to
suffocation, burns the skin and also destroys bone marrow,
Freilinger said.
   The gas is heavier than air, which he said would explain how it
seeped into cellars where the patients said they had been hiding
during the attacks.
   Freilinger said poison gas penetrates everything, including
clothes.
   ``They can't run away from it because if they do, they breath it
in even deeper,'' he said.
   In the past, Iran has sent soldiers allegedly poisoned by
mustard gas to Vienna and other European cities for treatment. In
July, Iranian civilians were sent for treatment for the first time.
   Since 1984, Freilinger has treated about 30 victims of alleged
chemical weapons attacks in the 7{-year-old Persian Gulf war. He
said about half of them had survived, but the latest victims were
injured nearly two weeks ago, meaning the damage done by the gas
could not be reversed.
   Freilinger said he visited areas allegedly bombed with chemical
weapons in 1984 and had taken a sample of the gas for verification
and testing.
   He said two of the patients, a child and a severely wounded
Iranian soldier, were to be placed in the intensive care unit at
his university clinic.
   Three women and a man were brought to private clinics in the
Austrian capital.
   In Geneva, three children aged between six and 11 were driven by
ambulance to the Lausanne University Hospital and two men and a
woman were flown on to Zurich and taken to the city's University
Hospital.
   A Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman said the six were granted
visas for Switzerland for humanitarian reasons. In 1985, five
Iranian soldiers allegedly wounded by Iraqi chemical weapons were
treated in Zurich and Lausanne. The following year, six more were
treated in Lausanne and in Liestal near Basel and two died.
   Five men and a 6-year-old girl were taken to Recklinghausen, 125
miles north of Frankfurt. Scores of Iranians injured in the war
have been flown in recent years to the West German town, which has
several clinics that specialize in respiratory ailments.
   About 70 Iranian protesters waving placards and photographs of
civilians allegedly burned by chemical gas gathered at London's
Heathrow Airport. Three male and three female patients were due to
be taken from the converted jumbo jet to Cromwell Hospital.

   President Daniel Ortega urged the
United States on Tuesday to negotiate a return to normal relations
with his leftist Sandinista government.
   Ortega said President Reagan had promised to begin discussions
with Nicaragua if the Sandinistas met with U.S.-supported Contra
rebels. A truce agreement with the Contras was reached last week.
   ``We hope President Reagan keeps his word,'' Ortega declared.
``He has repeatedly said that the day the Sandinistas sit down for
direct negotiations with the Contras, then the United States
government would sit down and negotiate with the Sandinistas.''
   Contra and Sandinista representatives reached general agreement
Tuesday on the size and location of zones where the rebels will
gather during a temporary 60-day cease-fire to begin Friday.
   A communique at the end of two days of talks in the southern
Nicaragua border town of Sapoa said two zones would be in the
northern part of the country, two on the Caribbean coast and one in
the south.
   Aristides Sanchez, head of the rebel delegation, said exact
locations would not be disclosed yet.
   Still to be decided was how the truce will work, said Maj. Gen.
Joaquin Cuadra, chief government delegate.
   He said it would be a main topic when talks resume in Sapoa next
Tuesday.
   The agreement signed last week does not say if the rebels must
lay down their arms during the truce.
   ``What is important in these meetings is that they have
advanced,'' Cuadra said.
   He called the talks ``an important step toward the permanent
cease-fire.'' Cuadra said the cease-fire will take effect Friday as
scheduled, even though the conditions were not agreed upon.
   Sanchez said the talks ``are quite delicate. We are trying to
guarantee the physical and moral security of our combatants.''
   Ortega spoke at a ceremony honoring anti-war activist S. Brian
Willson of San Francisco as a ``hero of peace.'' Willson lost both
legs when a train ran over him during a protest at a U.S. Navy
weapons depot in Concord, Calif., last fall.
   Reagan told the Organization of American States in November that
Secretary of State George P. Shultz was prepared to meet with the
Sandinistas as part of discussions with other Central American
countries ``once serious negotiations'' on a Nicaraguan cease-fire
were under way.
   Direct talks between the United States and Nicaragua have not
been held since 1984.
   On March 23, the Sandinistas and Contras ended three days of
meetings with a signed agreement to work out a permanent cease-fire
in the civil war, which began in 1981, and restore democracy to
Nicaragua.
   Ortega's government refused for years to meet with the Contras,
insisting instead on negotiations with the United States.
   The Nicaraguan president said Tuesday: ``We hope he (Reagan) is
a man of his word and immediately fulfills his word to accept
bilateral conversations to deal with security issues that concern
the United States with respect to Nicaragua and with Nicaragua in
respect to the United States.''
   Those talks should concentrate on normalizing relations, not the
internal policies of Nicaragua, Ortega said, and added: ``We will
not directly discuss the democratic regime in Nicaragua or the
democratic regime in the United States.''
   Washington contends the Sandinistas broke promises made to the
OAS in 1979 in exchange for its support. The Reagan administration
says they promised democracy and delivered Marxism.
   The Sandinistas came to power in a revolution that ousted the
pro-American, rightist regime of the late President Anastasio
Somoza in July 1979. The United States supported the Sandinistas
initially, but in 1981 began financing the Contras.
   In his remarks Tuesday, Ortega urged the U.S. Congress not to
approve any Contra aid that would conflict with last week's
agreement, in which the Contras agreed to accept only humanitarian
assistance from neutral organizations.
   U.S. aid to the rebels expired Feb. 29 and Sandinistas sources
have cited lack of aid as the reason the Contras signed the truce
agreement.
   Rebel spokesmen say continuing the war is unnecessary if the
Sandinistas keep their promises of restoring democratic freedoms.
   For the Sandinistas, the agreement could ease internal pressures
created by dissatisfaction with the war, an unpopular military
draft, food shortages and a shattered economy.

<HEAD>Goetz Appeals Conviction and Six-Month Sentence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bernhard H. Goetz on Tuesday appealed his
conviction on weapons charges in the 1984 subway shooting of four
teen-agers, saying the instructions to the jurors did not give them
the option of being merciful toward him.
   The appeal, which contained a legal attack on his sentence as
well as his conviction, was filed at the state Supreme Court's
Appellate Division by his lawyer, Barry Slotnick.
   Goetz, 40, is free on $5,000 bail pending appeal. After a widely
publicized trial, the man dubbed the ``subway vigilante'' was
convicted last June on one count of third-degree weapons possession
but acquitted of more serious charges in the December 1984
shootings.
   Goetz said he shot the four young men, all 19, because they were
trying to rob him when they approached and asked for $5. The men
said they were merely panhandling.
   In the appeal, Slotnick argued that the trial judge, Stephen
Crane, illegally violated Goetz's right to have a jury decide his
guilt or innocence on the weapons charge by telling the jurors they
``must'' _ rather than they ``may'' _ convict, if they found Goetz
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
   The lawyer argued the judge voided the jury's power to find that
a defendant committed a criminal act but also deserved mercy.
   ``Jury mercy is indeed a well-recognized phenomenon indigenous
to out justice system,'' Slotnick wrote.
   Slotnick also argued against the sentence that Crane imposed
last October: six months in jail and 4{ years' probation, plus
community service, a fine and counseling.
   Paradoxically, Slotnick argued for a longer, one-year jail
sentence, because a definite one-year sentence would make Goetz
eligible for parole in two months. His sentence as it now stands
means he must serve the six months with the possibility of being
jailed again if he violates probation.
   The one-year sentence is required because there is a state law
requiring a mandatory year in jail for a weapons possession
conviction, and the law does not mention splitting the sentence
into part jail time, part probation, the lawyer said.
   The appeals brief also argued that a jail sentence would be
``unduly harsh'' in Goetz's case because of his state of mind.
Slotnick said Goetz continues to suffer ``psychic pain'' because of
the intense publicity the case received.
   Goetz had no comment on the appeal.

   A meeting including Mother Teresa, the Dalai
Lama, Carl Sagan, and officials from the United States, Soviet
Union and United Nations will be a unique collaboration on problems
that threaten human survival, planners said Tuesday.
   Most of the world's forums, national and international, approach
problems only politically, which is just one side of the world's
``two vast structures,'' said the Very Rev. James Parks Morton,
dean of New York's Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
   Religious forces ``have been excluded from the debate,'' he
said, adding, ``It seems that the adjudication has got to be both
sides working together.'' Morton is co-chairman of the Global
Conference of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival
April 11-15 at Oxford University in England.
   About 100 elected leaders from around the world and about 100
religious leaders of five major faiths are scheduled to
participate. Morton's co-chairman is Sen. Sat Paul Mittal of India.
   Angier Biddle Duke, chairman of the international advisory
committee for the conference, described it as ``first time in
modern history'' for religious-political collaboration on such a
range of critical issues. Duke is a former U.S. ambassador to Spain
and El Salvador.
   In dealing with dangers to life on earth, ``politicians haven't
been able to do it on their own,'' said Rep. James H. Scheuer,
D-N.Y., who plans to attend the conference.
   ``We must merge the ethical and the practicial, the politician
and the priest, the sacred and the secular.''
   He and Sagan, a Cornell University astronomer, ticked off a long
list of threats to the planet, includingtoxic waste, acid rain,
depletion the protective ozone layer allowing in more destructive
ultraviolet rays, the temperature-raising ``greenhouse effect'' of
fossil fuels, AIDS, and nuclear arms.
   Some of the effects ``are so serious as they can be described
only in words of Catholic theology as crimes against creation,''
Sagan said.
   Political leaders have looked at the problems without doing
much, he said, and religions, ``repositories of classical wisdom,''
must become involved to raise consciousness.
   Other participants include Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, Cardinal Franz Koenig of Austria, Soviet Academy of
Sciences vice president Evguenij Velikhov, U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar and MacArthur Foundation Chairman Thornton
Bradshaw.
   Financing for the conference, expected to be about $1 million,
has come from individual religious donors, said the conference
executive coordinator, Akio Matsumura of New York.

   Two network journalists beaten at their hotel in
Panama by plainclothes police flew here Tuesday, and one said he
wouldn't believe his experience if he had seen it in a movie.
   ``I've never seen anything like it in any other country,
grabbing people like that,'' said Ignacio Medrano, a CBS cameraman
who limped in a stoop as he was helped off a chartered private jet
at Miami International Airport. ``If we'd seen it in a movie, I
would've said they were lying.''
   Medrano was admitted to Mount Sinai Medical Center in
satisfactory condition Tuesday night with broken ribs, a hospital
spokeswoman said. Before being taken there by ambulance, he said
X-rays in Panama had indicated no broken bones, but his ribs had
turned purple and his legs ached from a beating with a nightstick.
   At least 10 foreign journalists and 20 opposition leaders were
arrested Monday when troops raided the Marriott Hotel in Panama
City. Most were released by Tuesday.
   Medrano said he came to the aid of NBC cameraman Domingo Rex of
Mexico City, who said he suffered a broken nose when punched by a
plainclothes security agent. The officer broke his wrist throwing
the punch, Rex said.
   ``He tried to grab my camera and we started fighting. He got
real mad,'' said Rex, whose nose was covered with gauze and tape.
``At this point, Ignacio Medrano tried to save me and they beat him
too.''
   ``It is really scary because they are up. They are looking for
the press. They were after them,'' Rex said, adding he paid a $365
fine to be released from jail, returned to his hotel and left the
country.
   ``At one point, I was really scared a lot, scared about leaving
this place alive,'' said Rex, who had been in Panama for 17 days.
``I decided it was time to go.''
   People in the hotel, which serves as the headquarters of
Panama's opposition and the foreign press, were attacked by agents
with guns pointing in the air, Medrano said.
   ``They just threw me in the van with the rest of the people,''
he said. ``They kicked me all the way to the van.''
   Alfredo Gudino, an NBC sound technician, also returned on the
chartered plane. He was detained but not injured.
   The Overseas Press Club, a New York-based organization of
jounalists, sent a letter of protest Tuesday to Panama's ruler,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.

<TEXT>
   Oliver Tambo, head of the African
National Congress, accused South Africa Tuesday of a plot to kill
ANC representatives in Mozambique with poison sugar.
   Tambo told a news conference in Harare that South Africa had
arranged for a third country to deliver the poisoned sugar,
apparently as a gift, to ANC officials in Maputo, the capital of
neighboring Mozambique.
   He did not name the third country allegedly involved but said
the sugar ``was brought into Mozambique by a country in which the
Pretoria regime operates freely.''
   Tambo did not say if any ANC officials had been poisoned.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla group fighting South Africa's
policy of apartheid, or legalized racial discrimination by the
white minority.
   Tambo is in Harare for a 3-day conference of West European
parliamentarians on apartheid. The conference, attended by
delegates from 14 countries, ends Wednesday.
   ``As long as it (apartheid) remains there will be no peace in
the region,'' Tambo said. ``This message was clear yesterday when
for no reason at all South Africa attacked Botswana.''
   He referred to the South African military attack Monday on a
house on the outskirts of Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, in
which four people were killed.
   South African confirmed the raid and said the four people killed
were terrorists. Botswana said one man and three woman were killed.
It said the man was a ``South African refugee,'' two of the women
were Botswanans and the third woman had not been identified.
   In an attack Tuesday in Paris, Dulcie September, the ANC
representative for France, was shot to death in her office. French
news reports said Mrs. September, 45, was shot in the face while
entering the office at about 9 .m.
   ANC officials claimed South Africa was behind the killing, but
South Africa denied it and suggested the attack was related to
strife within the outlawed organization.
   Tambo, based in the Zambian capital of Lusaka, told the news
conference: ``We must step up our attacks on the police, the army
and other personnel associated with the institution'' of apartheid.
   ``We will strike against its economic infrastructure and do much
more intensively what we have been doing all the time.''
   By South African law and custom, apartheid establishes a
segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   The Panchen Lama, highest Tibetan religious
leader in the Chinese government, said Tuesday four people were
killed in a pro-independence protest earlier this month in Lhasa,
capital of the remote Himalayan region.
   Official Chinese reports have said the only fatality was a
Chinese policeman.
   The Panchen Lama told Western reporters a monk and two civilians
also were killed. He spoke after meeting with a small group of
Tibetan delegates to the National People's Congress in Beijing.
   Western travelers in Lhasa have said Tibetans were reporting 21
civilians and 3 policemen killed, and many arrests. The Panchen
Lama would not comment on the reports of arrests.
   Buddhist monks and lay people in Lhasa held a violent
anti-Chinese protest March 5 at the close of the annual Moinlam
Qenmo, or great prayer festival, that lasted more than 12 hours.
   Reports from witnesses said they attacked police with stones,
knives and steel bars, seriously injuring 30 officers, and set
bonfires throughout the city.
   Buddhist priests seeking independence for Tibet led a protest
last October in which at least 14 people were killed and a police
station was destroyed.
   The Panchen Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's second-highest leader after
the Dalai Lama, continued his campaign Tuesday for a lenient policy
toward Tibet.
   The Dalai Lama, a god-king to Tibetan Buddhists, went into exile
in India after an unsuccessful rebellion in 1959. China took over
Tibet in 1950.
   Under the Panchen Lama's proposals, efforts would continue to
heal wounds caused by China's radical Cultural Revolution of
1966-76. Religious belief was outlawed and many Buddhist temples
and monasteries were destroyed during that period.
   ``How we implement our religious policies will have a great
affect on the thinking of the masses in Tibet, where nearly
everyone is religious,'' said the Panchen Lama, a loyal supporter
of China's communist government.
   He also addressed militants advocating Tibetan independence:
``Some separatists outside China want to split Tibet from the
motherland,'' he said. ``They'd better stop their dirty tricks.
Tibetan affairs are Chinese domestic affairs, and they are family
affairs.''

   As Sandinista government and rebel
negotiators met to work out details for a 60-day cease-fire, a
Contra commander vowed the rebels won't lay down their arms until
Nicaragua adopts democratic reforms.
   The negotiators, who met Monday, are considering the areas where
the rebels, known as Contras, will gather during the cease-fire,
which is to begin Friday under the peace accord signed last week in
Sapoa.
   After about two hours of discussions Monday, the talks were

   House negotiators working on an aid package to
sustain the Nicaraguan rebels have hit a snag over whether
President Reagan should have the power to command quick
congressional action on a possible future military aid request.
   Leaders of the chamber worked for five hours Monday on the
package, and roughed out a six-month, $40 million aid bill that
would send strictly ``humanitarian'' aid _ food, clothing, medicine
and shelter _ while the rebels negotiate a permanent peace with the
country's leftist Sandinista government.
   ``We reached some general understandings in a number of areas,
but there were some stumbling points,'' said House Democratic Whip
Tony Coelho of California, who added that meetings would resume
today.

   ``It was a little bizarre that an independent counsel would be

   Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis and Bush both aimed to cement
six-state New England sweeps, but their similarities ended there.
   Dukakis led Jackson, the man with momentum in the race, as well
as Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and Sen. Paul Simon with about 50 percent
of the vote in one pre-election poll.

Iranian cities with chemical weapons.
   Iran, which accused the Iraqis of using chemical bombs in the
same area last week, said Revolutionary Guards were moving deeper
into Iraq territory in the northern campaign.
   Baghdad's official news agency said Iraqi warplanes raided two

both sides since the war began in September 1980.

   A young man was charged Tuesday with
killing an Indian judicial candidate and an alleged accomplice
committed suicide, in a case the sheriff called ``just another
murder'' stemming from a broken romance, not a political
assassination.
   The death Saturday of Julian Pierce initially was characterized
by authorities as a political slaying, and some people in Robeson
County speculated it was the work of someone who objected to an
Indian becoming a judge. The county's population is evenly divided
among Indians, blacks and whites.
   ``I can assure the world that there was no political involvement
in the case,'' Sheriff Hubert Stone said at a news conference. ``I
think the people of Robeson County will understand that it's just

   The Senate met in unusual secret session
Tuesday to review conflicting intelligence estimates on the size of
the Soviet medium-range missile force. But conservatives who called
for the meeting said few minds had been changed about the new
treaty eliminating such nuclear weapons.
   Backroom bargaining intensified, meanwhile, on two other
controversies related to Senate ratification of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty.
   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee said Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci was working out procedures to deal with

   In a second upbeat economic report Tuesday, the government said
that sales of new homes, which had fallen for three consecutive
months, shot up 20.3 percent in February, the biggest monthly gain

<TEXT>
   ``The Fortunate Pilgrim,'' based on novelist
Mario Puzo's sweeping saga of an Italian immigrant family in search
of the American dream, is, unfortunately, a tedious, wooden
melodrama in its adaptation for TV.
   NBC will air the two-part, five-hour miniseries on Sunday and
Monday, April 3-4.
   Sophia Loren, whose husband, Carlo Ponti, produced ``The
Fortunate Pilgrim,'' stars as plucky matriarch Lucia Corbo, whose
first husband is killed in a factory explosion, and whose second
husband, played by Edward James Olmos of ``Miami Vice,'' succumbs
to insanity. Her children, meanwhile, get tuberculosis, arrested
and the neighbor's wife pregnant.
   Hal Holbrook arrives in Part 2 as a Scotch-French doctor who
romances Lucia. John Turturro, who made his mark playing malevolent
types in such films as ``To Live and Die in L.A.'' and ``Five
Corners,'' is eldest son Larry.
   The movie, a period piece set in the 1920s and '30s, was shot
against an almost sepia-toned backdrop by director Stuart Cooper,
who did the miniseries ``The Long Hot Summer.'' This one was filmed
on location in Yugoslavia, but the sets look more like a studio
backlot. Also, inexplicably, the dialogue sounds dubbed much of the
time.
   Cooper's rudimentary direction is matched only by the pedestrian
script. Drama needs conflict. The fluffy ``I'll Take Manhattan,''
even with broadly drawn characters and plotlines, worked because it
at least had structure.
   ``The Fortunate Pilgrim'' is a muddle. The central conflict
seems to be Lucia's dream for a home in the country and success for
her children running up against her offspring's constant moral
lapses, illnesses and scrapes with neighbors and the law. An early
symbol of evil is a laughably Snidely Whiplash-like landlord.
   The result is a meandering plotline composed of a series of
unconnected events, most of which have no buildup or ramifications.
   In John McGreevey's script, as well, character development
consists of simplistic dialogue, although it doesn't help us
connect with them to switch actors every hour or two as the
children age.
   A sample scene: Early in Part 2, son Vinnie goes to comfort
sister-in-law Luisa who is weeping after being insulted by her
husband, Larry. We have seen these two only in passing, so this is
supposed to establish their characters.
   ``Too bad you didn't get to finish high school. I probably won't
either,'' Vinnie says at one point.
   ``You should. Vinnie, you're so smart,'' says Luisa.
   ``Mom depends on me. That's the way it is,'' he replies.
   ``You're too kind,'' she says. ``You're always doing things for
other people.''
   The miniseries does have the dubious honor of stifling a fine
cast.
   Loren is becoming something of a TV movie regular _ she was in
``Courage'' last season and before that ``Aurora'' and ``Sophia
Loren: Her Own Story'' _ and she is still a charismatic screen
presence.
   Olmos, who plays enigmatic Martin Castillo on ``Vice,'' does a
good job with smoldering Frank Corbo, convincing us by strength of
performance that Lucia could indeed fall in love with this troubled
man.
   Annabella Sciorra makes an impressive television debut as
Octavia, Lucia's headstrong eldest daughter. Also notable is
Yugoslavian actress Mirjana Karanovic who plays Clara, a married
woman who becomes pregnant by Larry.
   All these immigrants are yearning to breathe free.

Weaving) and a friend (John Polson) from the death penalty after

<HEAD>Orphaned Organs Find Help and New Churches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

   Lawrence Trupiano saved most of the organ from
St. Paul's, Hoboken _ everything but the bellows, which was too big
to fit through any door.
   ``The builders had the mentality that they would last forever.
They'll put things where you couldn't get to them,'' Trupiano said.
   Organs don't last without help, though; not in the smog of a big
city, or in a church where the furnace dries and cracks a wooden
instrument. Nor do they stand up under careless tuning, or the
assaults of mice tempted by the taste of horsehide glue in the
bellows.
   The organ at St. Paul's didn't play at all when Trupiano moved
it from the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River to his shop in
Brooklyn. It will sing again, though, in a church in Manhattan
which is giving up high tech for the time-tested sound of pipes.
   Dozens of organs become orphans each year, no longer wanted
because struggling churches close and prosperous churches buy new
instruments. Many, like the organ from St. Paul's, turn up in new
homes.
   Alan Laufman, who runs the Organ Clearing House in Norrisville,
N.H., has about 120 organs available at any time.
   ``Sometimes we get a call on a Thursday afternoon saying that a
church will be torn down on Monday, and can we find a home for the
organ. Sometimes we can,'' Laufman said in a telephone interview.
   Since the Clearing House was started in 1959, Laufman estimates
that more than 1,200 organs have found new homes, in one case as
far away as Yokohama, Japan.
   Perhaps the proudest match was between the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York and an organ built by Thomas Appleton of Boston
in 1830. It was found, unused, in a Pennsylvania church. Trupiano's
shop returned it to playing condition, complete with hand-pumped
bellows.
   ``It was a time-capsule of information. It was just like
Appleton built it,'' said Trupiano, who restored the organ to
playing condition. ``It answered a lot of unknowns from organs
built at that time.''
   Other organs require educated guesses. He is now restoring
another organ for the Metropolitan _ a home organ which he thinks
was built in 1821.
   ``You are always trying to understand what the builder was
trying to do,'' he said, and the surest guide is the instrument
itself. ``The pipe will tell you what it wants to do.''
   The organ from St. Paul's, built in 1890, was remodeled in 1920.
Trupiano is reworking it again, adding to the 1,600 pipes which
came from Hoboken.
   First it received a thorough cleaning.
   ``If it's from New York City, the problem is exhaust fumes. The
grease and dirt is almost a paste,'' Trupiano said.
   Calgon and hot water works well on metal pipes, while steel
wool, moist cheesecloth and elbow grease are recommended for the
less numerous wooden pipes.
   Trupiano says he rarely has to rebuild a pipe, but many are
fitted with felt or leather which must be replaced. Some pipes are
beyond help, bent and buckled by a ham-handed tuner.
   Keyboards have to be rebuilt, with bone instead of ivory because
ivory imports are banned. The thousands of parts of the action, the
mechanism which links the keys to the pipes, must be cleaned and
reassembled.
   ``Usually we tell a church it's going to take two years,'' said
Trupiano, who has four people working in his shop.
   ``Half the battle with electronic instruments is that churches
want instant gratification,'' he added. ``You pay your money, and
by next week you have your noise.''
   And in 15 years you'll need a new instrument, said Laufman, who
found that most of the churches looking to adopt a pipe organ are
replacing an electric instrument less than 20 years old.
   ``I know how long a pipe organ will last,'' he said. ``I play
one every Sunday that was built in 1853.''
   Adopting an organ costs $10,000 and up, Laufman said, though the
investment is anywhere from 30 percent to 70 percent less than the
price of a comparable new organ.
   Organized efforts to preserve historic organs began only in 1956
with the founding of the Organ Historical Society, based in
Richmond, Va. The society has tracked down 4,498 American organs
built in the 19th century, said William van Pelt, the executive
director.
   ``Most are still working every Sunday, and most were built with
considerable integrity,'' van Pelt said. ``Many of these are less
ambitious, adequate Sunday by Sunday church organs, not magnificent
concert instruments.''
   Many 19th-century instruments were lost, van Pelt said, because
churches could afford to replace them. Other organs fell victim to
renewed interest in Baroque music and a demand for organs built in
the German style of Bach's time.
   The Organ Historical Society concentrates on organs built before
1850, or instruments built in the second half of the 19th century
which are essentially unaltered.
   Van Pelt's computer has a list of 450 shops across the country
that could do restoration.
   Trupiano was bitten by the organ bug 25 years ago, when he was
13 and spent hours watching a new organ being installed in his
church. It didn't occur to him then to worry about the fate of the
old organ.
   Laufman, a former teacher, was lured into the field by a
12-year-old student who had saved an organ that was being removed
from a New Hampshire church ``with sledgehammers and chainsaws.''
   ``That church is now on its third electronic instrument,''
Laufman noted with satisfaction. ``The old organ, built in 1858,
was lovingly reworked by this kid, and parts of it are still
playing in a suburb of Boston.''

   At any one time, Ardyth Lohuis is trying to
match 20 to 25 churches who want to hire an organist with two or
three musicians who are looking for jobs.
   ``Some churches call me month after month saying, `Don't you
have someone?''' said Lohuis, a professor of organ and church music
at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and director of a
referral service for state chapters of the American Guild of
Organists.
   What the churches want, typically, is someone to play one or two
services a week, plus a choir rehearsal, and often one full week of
revival services.
   ``They're hoping to get someone to do this for $4,500, which is
not even minimum wage,'' she said.
   It's getting harder to find takers.
   According to the National Association of Schools of Music, the
number of undergraduate organ majors fell from 673 in the 1982-83
school year to 469 in 1984-85, and the number of schools offering
majors declined from 194 to 160.
   At Oberlin College in Ohio, there are now fewer than 20
undergraduate organ students, compared to perhaps 50 a
quarter-century ago, said David Bow, dean of the college's
Conservatory of Music.
   ``I would say that the quality of the students we have now is as
high as I can remember. They are extraordinarily committed,'' he
said.
   However, Bow noted, ``We see a high school pool out there that
is a quarter or a fifth the size it was 15 years ago.''
   In contrast, the number of applications for other instrumental
programs at Oberlin is up 21.8 percent this year.
   Charles Krusenstjerna, director of admissions at the Eastman
School of Music at Rochester University in New York, says the drop
is partly a demographic phenomenon. The number of entering freshmen
in the United States has fallen from a peak of 2.6 million in 1981
to 2.3 million in 1985, according to the U.S. Department of
Education.
   Krusenstjerna said the school expects to have about 40
applications from organ students this year, down from an all-time
high of 60 several years ago.
   Daniel Nelson Colburn II, executive director of the
25,000-member American Guild of Organists, and John Walker,
chairman of the AGO's Task Force on the New Organist, suggested in
a recent interview that several factors are at work:
   _ Mainline churches, which attach more importance to elaborate
liturgy set to classical music, are not growing rapidly, if at all.
   ``People simply don't go to church as much,'' Colburn said. ``It
is no longer automatically to be assumed that a sort of
middle-American person has been exposed to this music at all.''
   _ More women are going to work, leaving fewer of the talented
housewives who have filled many an organ job for token compensation.
   _ Fewer students are willing to enter a profession in which
$25,000 is a princely salary and only a handful of positions pay
$50,000.
   ``One of the basic problems ... is the residual sense of a lot
of church members throughout the country that whatever you do for
the church needs to be done voluntarily,'' said Walker, organist at
New York's Riverside Church and chairman of the organ department at
the Manhattan School of Music.
   One of his doctoral students recently found a job outside the
city paying $20,000 a year. ``This means years and years of study
to get there, and he's thrilled to death,'' Walker said.
   ``The people who do this profession, in my generalized view,
still love what they do,'' Colburn said. ``To the extent they are
aware of these problems, they are frustrated. ... But I don't see a
lot of people leaving.''
   He just sees fewer people entering.
   The AGO, with a touch of exaggeration, has been asking: ``Will
we worship with music in the year 2000?'' In fact, Colburn said,
there is almost a glut of highly trained organists with advanced
degrees competing for the best jobs. The shortage affects the
smaller churches.
   The guild's strategy is to seek publicity, through promotions
such as ``Organ Week'' which it will launch next year, and to seek
out and encourage promising high school musicians.
   In Sioux Falls, S.D., the AGO chapter last fall awarded five
$100 scholarships _ enough to pay for 10 lessons _ to aspiring
organists, including one in eighth grade.
   ``Substitutes are very hard to find,'' said Richard Collman,
secretary-treasurer of the 50-member state chapter. ``I know of
only one or two people in the high school age category studying the
pipe organ now.''
   Collman looks at youngsters with at least five years of piano
lessons, which is a good start toward mastering the two, three or
more keyboards of a pipe organ.
   Still, they have to learn a different ``touch,'' they have to
learn to play yet another keyboard with their feet and to adjust
tonal colors by drawing on combinations of pipes. The best jobs
often require the organist to direct a choir as well.
   ``My guess is that as organists continue to be scarce, the
churches that want live music will realize they will have to pay
more,'' Bow said.
   However, the volunteer ethic isn't dead.
   Walker received a letter from an organist in Vermont, who is
paid $2,796 a year.
   ``This represents a major increase just this year,'' the
organist wrote, ``and I have no wish to complain.''

<TEXT>
   A staggering amount of organ music is
heard in the United States, most of it live on Sunday mornings
though perhaps little of it worth hearing again.
   It's that smaller segment that Michael Barone pursues for
``Pipedreams,'' a 90-minute weekly showcase for organs and
organists on American Public Radio.
   The inspiration came in 1980 when Barone found himself running
the only tape recorder at an American Guild of Organists convention
in the Twin Cities.
   ``Gosh, this was incredible music, some good commissioned works,
some young artists who were just outstanding,'' said Barone, who
had a local organ program at the time.
   He put together 14 programs to offer nationally in 1982.
   ``I did it only because there seemed like a lot of good stuff
available, not only here that year but around the country, and
there didn't seem to be anyone else doing anything with it,'' he
said.
   That's still true.
   ``I'm getting the sense that though 128 stations do carry
`Pipedreams,' they may carry no other pipe organ music during the
week,'' Barone said.
   There is one other nationally distributed organ program _
half-hour performances by John Obetz from the headquarters of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in
Independence, Mo., which is carried by about 100 stations.
   ``Pipedreams'' ranges far more widely.
   Recently, for example, programs have featured the flamboyant
French organist Jean Guillou, the dedication of new organ at Iowa
State University, an anthology of American music and a variety of
Bach organ works played at several universities.
   One of Barone's favorite shows included what was apparently a
premiere performance _ 139 years after the composer's death _ of a
work by Felix Mendelssohn.
   In addition to the AGO conventions, Barone's digital tape
equipment has captured gatherings of the Organ Historical Society,
recital competitions of young organists and even the occasional
theater organ or choir. He also uses records, compact discs and

   Reagan, promoting his free-trade stance even in the face of

   A merger between photofinishing giants
Eastman Kodak Co. and Colorcraft Corp. is aimed at making the firms
more competitive rather than forcing other companies out of the
industry, a federal appeals court says.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday reversed a
preliminary injunction granted to Phototron Corp. that blocked the
Kodak-Colorcraft merger.
   A lower court ruled Feb. 22 that Phototron had standing to

   The new ruling, announced Monday, is effective for tax forms due

<HEAD>Anti-Takeover Legislation Promised In Koppers Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. John Heinz promised to push for a
law that would make a hostile takeover of Koppers Co. unpalatable
for British investor Brian Beazer, and Sen. Arlen Specter asked the
attorney general to enter the case personally.
   Heinz, a Pittsburgh Republican, charged at a news conference
Monday that if a $1.7 billion tender offer from BNS Inc. succeeds,
Beazer will gain a monopoly in various markets for aggregates, road
building materials that include sand and pebbles added to concrete
to make cement.
   ``A strangle hold on the existing aggregates business'' is
financially attractive because ``environmental laws are such at the
state and local level that you cannot easily open ... a new source
of aggregate,'' he said.
   Specter, a Philadelphia Republican, said he is concerned whether
an initial Jusice Department review satisfied the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Act, which sets guidelines for corporate takeovers. He asked
Attorney General Edwin Meese to personally review the Koppers case
and to respond to the request by Thursday.
   Heinz withheld details of his proposed legislation.
   ``To reveal our strategy might very well be to jeopardize its
success,'' he said.
   The proposal will be offered this week or after the Easter break
as an amendment to pending legislation, Heinz said.
   ``I'm not in the business of making hollow promises, and I do
not make idle threats,'' Heinz said. ``I have drafted and am
prepared to introduce and press legislation to make the takeover of
Koppers extremely unpalatable.
   ``The corporate raiders will be and should be as surprised by
this legislation as Koppers was by this raid,'' he said.
   ``We are not corporate raiders,'' Beazer declared in a full-page
advertisement Monday in Pittsburgh's newspapers. ``Our goal is not
to make a quick buck. Rather, we are in the process of creating a
vital, dynamic worldwide organization.''
   Beazer said that after he acquired the Atlanta homebuilder Cohn
Communities and the Dallas construction materials company
Gifford-Hill in 1985 and 1986 respectively, ``each of those
companies has grown and prospered under our ownership.''
   BNS Inc., a takeover company formed by Beazer and Shearon Lehman
Hutton Inc., bid $60 cash per share for Koppers stock under a
tender offer open until April 7. A federal court in California
temporarily has blocked the acquisition over antitrust concerns.
   Koppers management says it may sell all or part of the company
or pay cash to shareholders to keep the company out of Beazer's
hands.
   Heinz said taxpayers will spend more for public roads if the
takeover succeeds.
   ``The two of them combined in what are essentially local market
areas would, if the sale went through, amount to a de facto local
monopoly on very costly road-building materials,'' he said.
   The senator, Allegheny County Commission Chairman Thomas
Foerster and others at the news conference said the takeover
jeopardizes the approximately 1,100 Pittsburgh-area jobs in
Koppers' chemicals businesses. Beazer has said he would sell
chemicals and related businesses, although it is not clear that all
those jobs would be eliminated.
   Opponents also worry about the $232 million that Koppers
contributes to the area economy.
   Heinz joined city, county and state officials who have lambasted
Shearson for going a step beyond traditional takeover financing and
becoming an equity partner in the takeover company, BNS.
   ``I am appalled by the involvement of Shearson,'' he said.
``Shearson stands to gain tens of millions of dollars in fees
simply for shuffling some paper around.''
   Shearson officials have said their ownership in BNS is merely a
temporary method of helping finance the takeover.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies faced with increased competition and
more demanding consumers are learning to stress customer
satisfaction over bottom-line profit strategy, the president of a
Boston-based corporate research and training firm says.
   ``Right now, there are a lot of people playing around in each
others' back yard,'' said Richard C. Whiteley, president of The
Forum Corporation. ``With more options, the consumer is in a better
position to be selective.''
   A Forum Corporation survey of nearly 5,700 employees and
consumers released Monday said top-level management should rely on
``front-line'' employees and the public to gauge service quality
and corporate image.
   ``Companies are learning that they need the consumer and that
service has got to improve or they can lose their business
overnight if they're not careful,'' said Whiteley, who estimates
consumer complaints have doubled since 1980.
   The survey, which included more than 3,200 employees at 14 large
companies in the United States and Canada, revealed a trend toward
stressing consumer satisfaction.
   ``There's a certain arrogance in companies on a downward
spiral,'' Whiteley said. ``They think they know what their
customers need more than their customers do.''
   The survey indicated that empathy and responsiveness among
so-called front-line workers who deal directly with the public
leads to customer loyalty and new business.
   But the report noted that managers constantly must seek comments
and advice from front-line employees and customers, who have the
best sense of how the company is perceived in the marketplace.
   The report also notes that the attitudes of front-line workers
is heavily influenced by upper management.
   ``Consumer focus ... has come to be regarded as a complex notion
that involves the entire organization, and not just something that
is the responsibility of people who are sometimes the lowest-paid,
least-trained and least-motivated employees in the company,'' the
report said.
   Whiteley cited toll-free information numbers, consumer
questionnaires and maintaining executives' connection with the
public as methods successfully used by companies seeking to enhance
image and customer satisfaction.
   ``You now hear, `Thank you for calling AT&T' when you call,'' he
said. ``That wasn't the case years ago.''
   Whiteley predicted more U.S. companies will foster better
consumer policies as foreign and domestic competition grows.
   Forty percent of the 2,374 consumers interviewed late last year
in the two-month survey said poor service prompted them to pull
away their business. An additional 30 percent cited ``other
reasons'' for switching, including some service-related problems,
according to the report.
   But between 60 percent and 73 percent of consumer respondents
rated service quality with the companies ``excellent,'' according
to the report.
   ``We found their standards are just lower,'' said Thomas
Atkinson, who supervised the survey. ``There's the impression that
service just is not very good in America anymore.''
   The number of employees who said that ``satisfying customers''
was among their companies' top three priorities ranged from 8.7
percent to 63 percent.
   In addition, ``attracting new customers'' was considered a
priority almost twice as often as ``keeping customers'' among the
corporate sponsors of the survey, which included manufacterers,
high-techonology firms and service-oriented companies.
   The names of the companies were not released.
   ``In general, priorities having to do with customers or better
financial performance were seen as key by the employees ... while
objectives such as emphasizing quality, finding new products and
finding new markets ranked lower,'' the report said
   A final version of the findings is scheduled to be released in
September, Atkinson said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar recovered from an early plunge in Tokyo
trading today following moderate intervention by Japan's central
bank, while stock prices posted substantial gains for the second
consecutive day.
   Traders said the U.S. currency's recovery during the day's
trading was due mostly to technical factors, including dollar
purchases by participants with dollar-short positions.
   ``Sentiments toward the dollar are still bearish,'' said a
trader who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The Bank of Japan's
intervention wasn't large, and much of the dollar buying was by
people who recently sold dollars and were beginning to feel
nervous.''
   The U.S. currency now has fallen 2.78 yen in Tokyo over the past
four trading days.
   The Bank of Japan began buying dollars shortly after the U.S.
currency opened at 123.88 yen, down 0.55 yen from Monday's close of
124.43 yen. Traders estimated the central bank's purchases at about
$100 million. As usual, the bank did not comment officially on its
market activity.
   The dollar then reversed direction, and ended the day's trading
at 124.37 yen, down 0.06 yen from its close on Monday. It ranged
between 123.87 yen and 124.85 yen.
   Traders said the dollar also was boosted by fiscal year-end
buying by some corporations. The Japanese fiscal year ends Thursday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-stock Nikkei Average gained
330.38 points, or 1.29 percent, closing at 25,953.09. On Monday,
the index rose 301.99 points.
   Nobuo Ishikawa of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage,
said market participants were relieved to see the dollar
stabilizing during today's trading.

A

<TEXT>
   Foreign visitors are boosting attendance at South
Florida tourist attractions from the Everglades to Ocean World,
while the number of vacationing collegians has plummeted to an
all-time low this decade.
   ``You have a truly unique place,'' said Klaus Mueller, who was
bird watching on the Anhinga Trail in the Everglades, the greatest
expanse of sawgrass in the world. ``Everybody in the world knows
about the Everglades.''
   Attendance at Everglades National Park is up 43 percent over
last season with 306,202 visitors in January and February compared
to 213,384 during the same time last year, spokesman Pat Tolle said
Monday.
   ``It's like a language school outside my office,'' said park
superintendent Michael Finley. ``I'm hearing French, German,
Japanese everywhere.''
   Jerome Scherr, president of Miami's Parrot Jungle, where
attendance was up 16 percent, said the attraction is ``something
different than they've got back home in Europe and Japan ... We're
subtropical _ palm trees and glamour.''
   The weak dollar against foreign currencies and the slick image
created by the television series ``Miami Vice'' are attracting many
of the foreign visitors to South Florida.
   Nigel and Rosy Collins visited Miami's Seaquarium during their
week-long trip to South Florida and Orlando from London. The couple
expected their vacation to cost half of what they would have paid
two years ago because of the weak dollar.
   ``Everything is so warm, so clean, so new, so cheap,'' Collins
said, as his wife chimed in, ``And you've got Don Johnson.''
   But the traditional spring break market in Fort Lauderdale is
going bust instead of boom this year, according to Broward County
tourism officials.
   A turnout of 200,000 college students had been expected,
matching last year's dismal turnout. However, the numbers now being
forecast range from 110,000 to 180,000, and the hotels and bars
that report solid business say it's due to the influx of European
tourists.
   Although South Florida tourist officials are uncertain of the
number of foreign tourists, international traffic at Miami
International Airport was up 9 percent to 786,951 passengers in
January compared to the same month last year.
   Finley expects Europeans to generate 80 percent of the business
at Flamingo Lodge at the southern tip of the Everglades in the
mosquito-swarming months of July and August.
   At Lion Country Safari, the Palm Beach County big-game preserve
and amusement park, a 25 percent boost in attendance over last year
was reported, said Lion Country marketing director Brian Osborne.
   Ocean World, where Fort Lauderdale visitors can pet dolphins and
watch sharks feed, reports 18 percent more visitors so far this
season. The attraction does not release specific admission figures,
said general manager George Boucher.
   Businesses that thrive on tourism expect the boom to continue as
long as the dollar is low.
   ``The English should be here big in April,'' Parrot Jungle's
Scherr said. South Americans will then travel north to avoid
winter, and Europeans will keep coming.

   Eastman Kodak Co. will seek to complete
its merger with fellow photofinishing giant Colorcraft Corp. now
that an appeals court has ruled the two were not trying to force
other companies out of the industry, a Kodak spokesman said.
   ``We're absolutely gratified,'' spokesman Henry Kaska said
Monday evening after hearing of the federal court ruling. ``It does
mean that we will be proceeding with that merger.''
   However, Kaska said it was still too early to tell when the
merger would actually take place.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday reversed a
preliminary injunction granted to Phototron Corp. that blocked the
Kodak-Colorcraft merger. The court ruled the merger was aimed at
making the firms more competitive and was not an attempt to put
others out of business.
   A lower court ruled Feb. 22 that Phototron had standing to
challenge the merger, and that the combination of Kodak and
Colorcraft could substantially reduce competition in the wholesale
photofinishing market.
   Kaska said the merger would not result in a monopoly of the
wholesale photofinishing business and retail operations known as
mini labs, but he could not immediately provide figures on how much
of the market the companies would control.
   Kodak operates 50 photofinishing labs throughout the United
States, while Colorcraft operates 41 labs. Phototron operates nine
labs in the southern and western United States.
   Kodak and Colorcraft decided to merge to make their
photofinishing operations more competitive. Phototron sued, asking
a district court in Texas to block the merger.
   The lower court issued a preliminary injunction, saying it was
appropriate given the threat of loss and damages Phototron could
suffer.
   However, the three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit said the
district court had ``erred in handing down a preliminary injunction
without first finding Phototron had demonstrated a substantial
likelihood of having suffered an antitrust injury.''
   The appeals court went on to say that under a previous ruling by
the U.S Supreme Court, a competitor can obtain a permanent
injunction against a merger only if it can prove the transaction
would violate antitrust laws.
   ``Under Cargill, a competitor ... has standing to challenge the
merger if an allegation and proof of predatory pricing is made,''
the appeals court said.
   The panel said Phototron has not offered substantial proof that
the merger would fall under the predatory pricing guidelines, and
therefore has not demonstrated the ``substantial likelihood'' it
would prevail in a trial.
   Phototron argued to the district court that Kodak and Colorcraft
had undercut the price Phototron offers retailers, and therefore
claimed that its two competitors could be operating unprofitably
and violating the predatory pricing prohibition.
   The appeals court said Phototron must prove Kodak and Colorcraft
are offering services below their own cost in order to satisfy the
``substantial likelihood'' requirement for a preliminary injunction.
   Kaska said the legal obstacles have only delayed the merger
several weeks. ``Obviously any delay would mean a loss of revenue,
but the delay was not that long,'' he said.

<HEAD>Share Prices Hold Most Gains Through Midday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the London stock exchange moved higher
Tuesday, aided by modest technical strength, bargain-hunting and
pre-holiday apathy.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100
selected stocks was up 11.6 points, or about 0.6 percent, at
1,758.1.
   Gains in Tokyo overnight, where the Nikkei stock average rose
330.58 points, and in New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was up 0.82 point on Monday, were less a support for the
market than a sign that markets were likely to take a temporary
breather until after the Easter weekend.
   Traders depicted the London advance as a technical bounce
following six consecutive days of declines.
   But they said the rally lacks momentum and predicted shares
would not advance much further barring an unexpected move by Wall
Street.
   One broker reckoned that after the four-day Easter holiday,
institutions could make a big showing in the market.
   ``They've got plenty of liquidity,'' he said. ``We could see
quite a good rise out of that after the holiday.''

<HEAD>EEC Approves French Aid to Renault</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Common Market's executive body has
approved French government aid to giant automaker Renault, but has
set certain conditions on the assistance.
   The European Economic Community Commission said Tuesday it has
approved French aid to Renault of 20 billion French francs, or
about $3.54 billion at current exchange rates.
   The decision, made a month before the French presidential
elections, marked the end of a two-year investigation into
government assistance to Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, which
is a state agency.
   The decision means that the French government is authorized to
proceed with a 12 billion franc write-off of Renault's debt.
Renault had 46.4 billion francs of debt at the end of 1987.
   The Commission said in a statement it also approved a
previously-made capital injection into Renault of 8 billion francs
because it had not been used to undercut prices in the 12-nation
Common Market.
   The Commission has the power to investigate government aid to
industry because of the potential anticompetitive effects of such
assistance.
   However, the Commission said it approved the aid under certain
conditions, including the conversion this year of Renault into a
state-owned company from a state agency, which escapes company law.
   Other conditions included the completion of an 83.4 billion
franc restructuring program and a pledge from the French government
not to grant further aid.
   The French Industry Ministry said in a statement in Paris that
the Commission's decision ``was good for the company.'' It said
Renault would now be in a position ``to compete on an equal footing
with its main competitors.''
   The Commission said Renault had been ``particularly hard hit''
by the crisis in the Common Market's auto sector in the early 1980s
when many companies had to reorganize their activities in the face
of reduced demand and rising imports from Japan.
   Renault's restructuring plan, which runs through 1990, involves
modernizing factories, cutting the workforce by at least 38,000 and
reducing production capacity by more than 25 percent.
   The Commission said the program would make a ``significant
contribution'' to resolving some of the problems of the European
car industry.

   Stocks prices staged a broad-based rally in
early trading today following Monday's mixed performance.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.77 to 1,992.54
in the first half hour of trading on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outpaced declines by about 4 to 1 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 864 up, 220 down, and 406 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board was about 24.21 million shares.
   Traders attributed the improvement to several factors, including
the dollar's stability in foreign exchange, which lessened fears of
inflatin and higher interest rates, and some bargain hunting.
   ``The market is in an oversold condition,'' explained Larry
Wachtel, market strategist and first vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``You usually snap back from that.
It could be nothing more or nothing less than that.''
   The NYSE composite index was up 0.97 at 147.08. At the American
Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.92 to 292.92.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed a scant 0.82
higher at 1,979.77, after posting moderate declines through much of
the trading session.
   Declining issues outpaced advances by more than 2-to-1 on the
NYSE, with 1,059 issues falling, 468 gaining and 420 unchanged. Big
Board volume totaled 142.82 million shares, down from 163.17
million in Friday's session.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade has suspended trading
in its 5-month-old CBOT Corporate Bond Index futures contract
because of a lack of sustained volume.
   The contract, based on an index of bonds issued by 100 U.S.
corporations, was launched Oct. 28, nine days after the stock
market collapse.
   The launch date, sandwiched between the market's plunge and the
traditionally low-volume winter holiday season, may have been one
reason for the contract's disappointing performance, William
Murschel, an exchange spokesman, said Monday.
   The Commodities Futures Trading Commission approved the
exchange's request to place the contract in ``dormant status,''
meaning the exchange could relaunch it at some future date,
Murschel said.
   The Commodity Exchange in New York also trades a corporate bond
index futures contract. That contract, based on Moody's
Investment-Grade Corporate Bond Index, was launched one day after
the CBOT contract and also has failed to attract much interest.

   Japanese exports of cars, trucks and buses fell 0.3
percent last month from February 1987 levels, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturer's Association announced Tuesday.
   Japan's automakers exported 528,605 vehicles last month, the
association said.
   The decline followed a 9.1 percent slide in January and
December's 2 percent climb, the first in 11 months.
   ``The environment surrounding Japan's automobile exports
continues to be severe,'' a JAMA official said. ``Shipments to some
markets showed growth, but those increases are marginal since they
are small markets.''
   Exports to the country's two largest markets, the United States
and the European Community, remained stalled as the yen continued
to climb.
   Shipments to the United States totaled 208,266 vehicles in
February, down 8.2 percent from a year earlier, while those to
Europe slid 5.4 percent to 133,473 vehicles.
   The strong yen has eroded the price-competitiveness of
Japanese-made autos, as well as those produced overseas.

<HEAD>Griffin Amends Suit Against Trump in Resorts Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment firm of entertainment
entrepreneur Merv Griffin amended a lawsuit against developer
Donald Trump to allege the controlling shareholder in Resorts
International Inc. schemed to depress the value of the casino
operator's shares.
   Griffin and Trump are making rival bids to take over the
hotel-casino concern, which has operations in New Jersey and the
Bahamas.
   The amended suit, filed by the Griffin Co. in federal district
court in Manhattan, ``adds to our claims concerning Mr. Trump's
scheme to depress the value of Resorts shares and lock up his
control in order to acquire Resorts on the cheap.''
   Trump has denied the charges.
   The suit added no new allegations. Rather it sought to buttress
its existing claims with new evidence.
   The suit, which seeks $500 million in damages, contends Trump
misled other shareholders, the public and government agencies by
withholding material information regarding the value of Resorts.
   Trump controls nearly all of Resorts' 572,000 Class B shares,
which has 100 votes per share, giving him 88 percent of the
company's voting power.
   He is offering $22 per share for the remainder of the Class B
stock and the company's 5.7 million shares of Class A common stock,
which has one vote per share.
   Griffin initially offered $35 per share, or $225 million, for
all of the company's stock. He has since boosted that offer to $295
million, allowing Resorts' directors to decide how to apportion it
between Class A and Class B stockholders.

<TEXT>
   Following in your father's footsteps is never
easy. It's even tougher when your father built a nearly $3 billion
computer company from scratch.
   But to hear Fred Wang talk, it's not that big a deal.
   ``I don't think I'm under any more stress or pressure than
anybody else seems to be at work,'' said the 37-year-old president
and chief operating officer of Wang Laboratories Inc.
   ``Having always worked for him, never having had a different
father, never having worked for anybody else, I don't know what
it's like _ I can't compare _ to be in a different environment.''
   But that doesn't mean Wang isn't under the gun: He must prove he
can turn around a company that's had more than its share of hard
times and a reputation for less-than-stellar customer service.
   Wang, based in Lowell, Mass., was once a Wall Street darling.
For over a decade its earnings increased more than 30 percent a
year as its word processors became standard equipment in the
secretarial suites of major corporations.
   But the good times collapsed in its fiscal year 1985, when,
beset by the computer industry slump and its own high operating
costs, Wang's profit slid to $15.5 million from $210.2 million the
year before.
   To shore up the company, the management under Wang's father, An
Wang, went through several rounds of layoffs, pay freezes and other
cost-cutting measures. But things got worse instead of better: The
company reported a loss of $30 million in the quarter ended Sept.
30, 1986. Its stock price and its image both sagged.
   Fred Wang was named president in November 1986 and almost
immediately took action. He eliminated 1,000 jobs _ on top of the
1,600 cut in 1986 and a like number the year before _ and reduced
salaries by 6 percent for all U.S. employees.
   But things didn't improve quickly. In fact, they appeared to get
worse. A little more than a month after he took office, the company
announced a loss of $78.6 million in the quarter ended that Dec. 30.
   Morale among the 30,000 Wang employees probably hit its nadir
when that loss was announced, he recalled in an interview here.
   ``We said OK, we've really got to get the place turned around,
get people focused in on, basically, expenses, getting more new
orders in,'' he said.
   The tonic finally took its effect in the quarter ended March 31,
1987, when the company reported a profit of $5.9 million. But it
still ended its fiscal 1987 a quarter later drenched in red ink _
$70.7 million worth of it.
   Wang also changed the structure of the company, letting out some
slack in the tight reins his father held by giving divisional
chiefs more authority. And he launched an innovative advertising
campaign _ in which actors posing as Wang employees boast in
computerese about their products.
   Since the profitable quarter ended March 31, 1987, Wang has
recorded earnings in three more quarters, including $34.1 million
in the period ended Dec. 31.
   ``The mood has turned around, and I think we've done some things
not only on the expense side but also on the advertising side and
really on the management side to get things moving in the positive
direction,'' he said.
   An Wang, a Chinese immigrant who founded the company in 1951 as
a maker of custom electronics components, has denied speculation
that he made his son the president because of the company's
problems. Instead, he said, the younger Wang was ready for more
responsibility. An Wang remains chairman and chief executive
officer.
   And Fred Wang denies that he's made any real departure from the
way the company was run by his father, universally called
``doctor'' in deference to his Harvard doctorate in physics.
Instead, Wang says, he's managed to communicate better with the
employees to battle corporate inertia.
   ``What sometimes gets lost in this Fred vs. Dr. Wang issue is
that a lot of the changes he has been a proponent of for some years
anyway, but a lot of the people said, `We did this five years ago,
that's the way we are going to do it.'
   ``Where he always had a grand strategy for the organization, he
kept most of it in his head. ...''
   Wang says he never set out to work at the company, let alone run
it. But when he graduated from Brown University with a math degree
_ after changing majors several times _ he had little career
direction.
   ``So here I was, 21 years old, June of 1972, unemployed,'' he
said.
   But since he learned to write computer programs at Brown, he
said he decided to work at Wang.
   After going through the ranks in the programming department,
Wang moved into marketing. Later, he headed the research and
development operations, and served as corporate treasurer. He also
is on the board of directors.
   Now, at the helm, Wang faces several challenges. In addition to
maintaining profitability, he must manage the company's transition
from a maker of word processsors to a broad-based seller of
minicomputers, data networks and information storage and management
tools, finding a niche for it alongside the giants of the computer
industry, International Business Machines Corp. and Digital
Equipment Corp.
   Wang says he's not talking about sheer size. Instead, he wants
Wang Labs to be viewed as an industry leader in other areas, such
as technology.
   The ads are part of the company's image-raising plan. He said
they're designed ``to change the nagging image of our being a
word-processing-only company to one of being a computer company
that specializes in the office.''
   They also serve another purpose: ``Our sales people had gone
through one hell of a year, with the industry slowdown and our own
internal problems. We wanted them to be seen as the hero of the ad
program,'' he said.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed to lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybean prices were pressured by profit-taking after Monday's
sharp gains. But the outlook for soybeans remains bullish, said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``I think today may be the pause that refreshes,'' Lespinasse
said. ``Hopefully we'll resume the uptrend tomorrow.''
   Contracts for May and July delivery of corn advanced slightly in
reaction to news that the government had granted one-year
extensions on certain corn loans from 1984, 1985 and 1986.
   The extensions mean farmers can delay decisions about marketing
hundreds of millions of bushels of corn that could have gone onto
the market this year, Lespinasse said.
   Other corn contracts posted early losses; wheat was fractionally
lower.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $2.99\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to { cent higher with May at $2.11 a bushel; oats were \ cent
to 1 cent lower with May at $1.65} a bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents
to 4} cents lower with May at $6.52 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent lower with April at 75.22
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .28 cent lower with
March at 82.85 cents a pound; hogs were .23 cent lower to .22 cent
higher with April at 45.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.30 cent lower to .03 cent higher with May at 56.15 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled higher on Monday while pork futures
retreated.

<HEAD>Thatcher Denies Policy Split with Lawson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament
that there isn't any policy split between herself and Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the Treasury's top official.
   ``Both Mr. Lawson and I put downward pressure on inflation as
topmost priority. Both of us think interest rate stability can be
very useful to industry,'' Mrs. Thatcher said Tuesday in response
to a question in the House of Commons.
   It was the first time that the Conservative prime minister had
publicly denied a split with Lawson, according to observers.
   After the government's recent decision to allow the British
pound to rise above 3.00 West German marks, there were press
reports that Lawson had been against allowing the pound to rise but
had been overruled by Mrs. Thatcher. The prime minister was more
concerned about the inflationary impact of any effort to stem the
pound's rise on world currency markets, the reports said.
   A stronger pound could hurt British exports and company profits.
   Earlier Tuesday, Lawson told a gathering of the Association of
American Correspondents in London that ``the whole (government)
policy is to ensure to continue to have downward pressure on
inflation.''
   ``There is no sign whatsoever of resurgence of inflation,''
Lawson said. Britain's annual inflation rate is currently 3.3
percent.
   He said Britain's intervention in the foreign-exchange markets
wasn't inflationary.
   Lawson also said he is ``perfectly satisfied'' with the current
trading level of the pound against the mark.
   The British currency was quoted at around 3.1050 marks on
Tuesday afternoon in London.
   But Lawson added that ``you shouldn't draw the conclusion from
that that there is a target'' for the pound against the mark.
   Lawson's lack of concern about the current inflation rate might
mean there is room for British interest rates to fall further. The
banks' base lending rate currently stands at 8.5 percent.
   The reported policy split between Mrs. Thatcher and Lawson
fueled speculation in recent weeks that he would resign his post,
which he has held since 1983.
   ``I haven't formed myself a view of how long I will remain
chancellor,'' Lawson said. ``I am not worn out and you can see my
hair hasn't turned gray.'' But he also said that no one holds a job
forever, and added, ``I have been chancellor longer than most.''
   Lawson also said he wasn't particularly concerned about
Britain's widening trade deficit, ``provided there is no resurgence
of inflation.''
   The Treasury is forecasting a doubling this year of the
current-account deficit to 4 billion pounds, or about $7 billion.
But the government on Friday reported a worse-than-expected
February deficit of 1.56 billion pounds, or around $2.9 billion,
which made the financial markets nervous.

   A New Hampshire company Monday said it would
build a catalog sales distribution center in Mexico, bringing 135
new jobs to the east-central Missouri city.
   Brookstone Co. of Peterborough, N.H. is building a
100,000-square-foot facility on a 16.9-acre site. Investment in the
plant was expected to be near $9.5 million.
   The city was told last week that it had been awarded a $500,000
grant to extend streets, water lines and sewer lines to the site.
   Construction was to be completed by July to allow the plant to
begin distribution of products purchased for the Christmas season.
   ``Brookstone's commitment represents a significant step in the
growth of the Mexico-area economy,'' said Mexico Mayor Larry Webber.
   Brookstone officials said they selected Mexico because of the
available work force and the positive relationship city officials
have with existing employers.
   Brookstone offers tools, household items and automotive
products. Besides it's catalog sales operation, Brookstone has 80
retail outlets in 26 states.

<HEAD>States Meet On Insurance Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives of four states met with New York
officials today to discuss antitrust lawsuits that have been filed
against major insurance companies.
   The states are seriously considering whether to join the
lawsuits and are seeking additional information.
   The New York attorney general's office briefed antitrust lawyers
from Connecticut, Ohio, Maryland and New Jersey on the
investigations that led to the filing of the suits last week,
according to Chris Braithwaite, a spokesman for New York State
Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   Nine states, including New York, filed suit last week alleging
that insurers conspired to restrict coverage and boost prices,
resulting in severe affordability and availability problems faced
by businesses, towns and other public agencies during 1985 and 1986.
   Eight of the suits were filed in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco. Texas filed in state district court in Austin.
   ``We can't speak for other states, but the door is certainly
open to others who want to file,'' Braithwaite said.
   ``Most likely we will be filing'' to join the other states in
the antitrust challenge, said John R. Hagerty, spokesman for New
Jersey Attorney General W. Cary Edwards. ``It's just a matter of
putting together the necessary information for that.''
   Neither the states that already have sued nor states considering
joining will comment on the evidence in the antitrust litigation.
However, the suits describe alleged conspiracies with details on
meetings and signed agreements.
   Connecticut has requested and received investigation materials
from California, said Robert Langer, Connecticut assistant attorney
general in charge of antitrust and consumer protection.
   Ohio wants to determine if its own state antitrust laws were
broken by insurers, said Michael Webb, spokesman for Ohio Attorney
General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr.
   Maryland also is asking its towns about their insurance problems
in the mid-1980s, said Michael F. Brockmeyer, assistant attorney
general and antitrust division chief.
   Defendants in the lawsuit are Aetna Casualty and Surety Co.,
Hartford Fire Insurance Co., Cigna Corp., and only in the Texas
lawsuit, Travelers Insurance Cos.

   American Stores Co. says it is prepared to
increase its offer for Lucky Stores Inc. to more than $1.9 billion
if a friendly merger of the two grocery store chains can be worked
out.
   American also filed a lawsuit in Delaware state court to enjoin
Lucky officers from defending against American's unsolicited tender
offer, indicating American may be bracing for a takeover battle.
   In a letter to the board of the Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky late
Monday, American chairman L.S. Skaggs said his company was ready to
offer $50 per share if a ``mutually acceptable agreement'' could be
worked out with Lucky.
   Earlier in the day, American launched a cash tender offer for
Lucky at $45 per share, or a total of $1.74 billion. That offer
expires at midnight April 22.
   ``We made clear our willingness to negotiate concerning all
aspects of our offer, including the price,'' said Skaggs in his
letter to Lucky.
   So far Lucky's representatives have declined to negotiate.
   American Stores Vice President Michael Holt today said the
company would have no comment on either the lawsuit or increased
stock cash offer. Lucky officials were not available to discuss the
matter this morning.
   The combination of American, the nation's third-largest grocery
retailer with 1,700 stores and annual sales of $15 billion, and
Lucky, the sixth-largest with 480 stores and sales of $7 billion,
could produce the biggest grocery retailer in the country, analysts
say.
   Lucky officials were not immediately available for comment on
the latest developments, which were announced in a press release
after the close of stock trading.
   Lucky shares advanced 87{ cents to close at $48.62{, while
American shares lost $1.75 to finish at $54.87{ on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Before American revealed the contents of its letter, Lucky
spokeswoman Lissa Perlman said company officials had been reviewing
the offer with financial and legal advisers since last week.
   Ms. Perlman said Lucky was advising stockholders not to take any
action on the American offer until Lucky's board of directors has a
chance to study the bid and make its recommendation.
   American's lawsuit, filed Friday in Wilmington, Del., alleges
Lucky and its executives have breached their fiduciary duties by
``following a course of conduct directed towards entrenching
themselves in control of Lucky Stores.''
   In the lawsuit, American said its representatives met with
Lucky's March 21 to announce the tender offer. American claimed the
$45 offered for each Lucky common share is about 40 percent over
the market price of the company's stock immediately before the
offer.
   American said its representatives advised Lucky Chairman John M.
Lillie that their company preferred to negotiate a friendly
acquisition and requested a prompt meeting to do so.
   But ``within hours of this meeting, Lucky ... set out on a
course of conduct which would deny the Lucky stockholders a premium
price for their shares and would preserve the position of the
company's management and the board,'' the suit alleged.
   The lawsuit further claimed that Lucky initially threatened to
take injunctive action against American and urged the Utah company
to delay its tender share filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, not to publicize the offer and to consider certain
arrangements between the two companies leading to abandonment of
the offer.
   Based on those attempts, the lawsuit said, American believes
Lucky's management ``will continue to refuse to negotiate seriously
... and will employ an array of defensive measures to prevent the
acquisition of the company in violation of the defendant's
fiduciary obligation and duties to its stockholders.''
   In a March 26 letter telling Lillie of the takeover plans,
Skaggs praised Lucky's management and marketing strategies and
invited Lucky executives to stay on if the deal is completed.
   Lucky's headquarters would remain in Dublin, Skaggs said.
   The bid for Lucky came 16 months after takeover specialist Asher
Edelman dropped his hostile effort to acquire the company. In
return, Lucky agreed to pay his $2.8 million in legal bills.
   Lucky kept Edelman at bay partially by selling off its
non-grocery divisions and adopting anti-takeover measures.
   After the text of the letter was released last week, Lucky
officials had no comment on the American's tender offer except to
say company bylaws contain a ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
provision limiting the voting power of any shareholder who acquires
more than 10 percent of Lucky's stock.
   In 1984, American spent $1.1 billion to take over Jewel
Companies Inc., a Chicago-based grocery, drug and convenience store
chain.
   That acquisition expanded American's operations from just over
1,000 retail outlets to its present 1,700. The company has three
divisions _ Skaggs, which operates supermarkets in the western
United States; American Superstores, which runs outlets in the
Midwest and East, and Osco Drug Stores, which has stores nationwide.
   The company operates stores under the names Acme, Jewel, Star,
Buttrey, Skaggs, Skaggs Alpha Beta, and Osco Drug.

<HEAD>British Aerospace Deal To Acquire State-Owned Rover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Aerospace PLC said Tuesday it reached an
agreement, as planned, to acquire Rover Group PLC from the British
government, for 150 million pounds, or $279 million.
   British Aerospace said that after it acquired the government's
99.8 percent stake in the automaker, the government would make a
cash injection of 800 million pounds, or $1.49 billion, into Rover
to cover the car maker's debt.
   British Aerospace said the acquisition is conditional on
approval of the cash injection by the European Commission, and on
the approval of British Aerospace shareholders.
   Rover's board of directors said it welcomed the agreement.
   British Aerospace said it ``intends to hold and develop the
principal businesses of the Rover Group.''
   The group is made up of the Austin Rover carmaker and the Land
Rover utility vehicle maker. It sold off its Leyland truck
operations last year.
   The government took over the automaker, then called British
Leyland, in 1975 to prevent its collapse. It sold off Jaguar PLC,
the luxury automaker, in July 1984.
   British Aerospace agreed to make unspecified payments to the
government if it decides to sell any of Rover's principal
businesses as going concerns.
   Rover recently announced trading profit, or profit before tax
and interest charges, of 27.9 million pounds, or $52 million, for
1987. That compared with a trading loss of 355.6 million pounds, or
$661 million, in 1986.
   British Aerospace said it also intends to purchase the remaining
0.2 percent of Rover shares, which are held by private investors.
The company will detail the terms of that offer to the private
shareholders after it secures the other approvals.
   British Aerospace said it values Rover's existing production
agreements with the Japanese automaker, Honda Motor Co., and
``wishes to build upon that relationship.''
   Rover Chairman Graham Day said the British Aerospace deal
``offers a speedy route to privatization with the minimum
disruption to our management, work force, dealer networks and
suppliers.''
   Trade Secretary Lord Young had announced in March that British
Aerospace had shown a serious interest in acquiring Rover, which
the government previously had said it intended to privatize.
   British Aerospace makes a variety of airplanes and aerospace
products for civilian and military use, and makes wings for Airbus
Industrie, the European civilian aircraft consortium.

   Stock prices advanced broadly this morning,
helped by relatively strong economic reports, a stable dollar and
falling interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 17.58 at 1,997.35
by noontime on Wall Street. The closely watched index had closed a
scant 0.82 higher Monday, although the rest of the market lost
ground.
   In the broader market today, advancing issues outpaced declines
by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 936 up,
401 down, and 479 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 72.98 million shares as of noon
Eastern time, compared with 70.43 million shares at the same point
in Monday's session.
   Before the stock market opened, the government reported its
chief economic forecasting gauge climbed 0.9 percent in February,
after falling in three of the past four months.
   In another economic report, the Commerce Department said that
sales of new homes jumped 20.3 percent in February, the biggest
advance in almost two years.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said the leading indicators figure suggested to some traders ``that
maybe those fears that the economy is going to run out of steam
either this year or next year are unfounded.''
   He said that news was welcomed by traders who saw prices
hammered last week, leaving stocks ``somewhwat oversold by most

trading helped stock prices by easing inflation fears and pushing
interest rates lower.

into a free-fall, that's a psychological prop,'' said Larry

Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Bond prices were up in early trading, depressing yields on
long-term Treasury issues that had risen to two-month highs on
Monday. At midday, 30-year bonds were yielding 8.78 percent
compared with 8.83 percent late Monday.

   Officials of IBP inc. said they will build
a $40 million state-of-the-art hog processing plant at Waterloo.
   ``We truly believe that Waterloo will be good for IBP and IBP
will be good for Waterloo,'' IBP Chairman Robert L. Peterson told a
Tuesday news conference.
   The pork and beef processing giant said in November 1986 it was
considering building a plant in northeastern Iowa. The company
focused attention on a Delaware County site south of Manchester
before opposition arose to IBP plans to dump treated sewage into
tributaries of the Maquoketa River.
   IBP will begin construction on the 365,000-square-foot plant
this spring at a 130-acre site in northeastern Waterloo. Completion
of the plant is expected to take a year and a half.
   When at full capacity, the plant will employ 1,200 to 1,500
people with an annual plyroll of more than $20 million and will
process 4 million hogs a year. IBP currently has four pork plants _
at Storm Lake, Louisa County and Council Bluffs in Iowa and
Madison, Neb. _ and employs 20,000 people at 15 plants in eight
states.

<HEAD>Kinnear Says Icahn Won't Take Over Texaco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate raider Carl C. Icahn will
not take over Texaco Inc., which is coming out of bankruptcy,
company President James Kinnear predicted today.
   Icahn, who owns 14.8 percent of Texaco and is the oil giant's
largest single shareholder, has threatened to run a panel of five
candidates for the Texaco's 14-member board at the next annual
meeting unless Texaco offers to put itself up for sale.
   But Kinnear, whose seat on the board of directors also is
threatened for takeover, said Texaco management will do its best to
keep Icahn out. Texaco officials have repeatedly said the company
is not for sale.
   ``He recently said in public that he has no intention of being
on Texaco's board or wanting to take control of the company, but
the next day he said he might run a proxy slate,'' Kinnear told a
news conference. ``I just don't know what his intentions are. My
prediction is that he will not take over this company.''
   Kinnear did not elaborate on the strategy for keeping Icahn from
making a run at the company.
   Icahn is not the only takeover artist known to be interested in
Texaco. Oilman T. Boone Pickens has said he is seeking federal
regulatory permission to acquire 15 percent or more of Texaco's
stock, as has Getty Petroleum Co., a large independent distributor
that was born of Texaco's takeover of Getty Oil.
   Kinnear talked to reporters after a speech to the National
Petroleum Refiners Association.
   He said the company would become leaner and stronger by selling
some assets to clear up its huge debt.
   Last week, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge approved a
reorganization plan that will enable Texaco to emerge from Chapter
11 protection early next month.
   Texaco filed for that protection last April to avoid having to
post an $11 billion security bond while appealing a $10.3 billion
judgment against the company held by Houston-based Pennzoil Co.
   The judgment stemmed from a November 1985 ruling by a Houston
jury that Texaco had improperly interfered with a Pennzoil bid to
acquire part of Getty Oil Co., then bought Getty itself.
   Texaco's reorganization plan calls for payment of $5.6 billion,
with $3 billion going to Pennzoil to drop the judgment and the rest
going to creditors.
   Texaco expects to sell $3 billion in assets to finance the
program, Kinnear said.
   In his speech, Kinnear said that the petrochemical industry
could profit if it remains lean.
   ``U.S. chemical manufacturers must adjust their thinking to a
slower-growth economy and to competition from new players,'' he
said. ``Revamping facilities, stretching existing units, or making
strategic acquisitions will generally yield far greater returns
than investing in new, grassroots plants with the expectation of
growing to full capacity in two or three years.''

   Hallmark Cards Inc. has announced that
it will sell its costume jewelry subsidiary to Crystal Brands Inc.
of Southport, Conn.
   Terms of the sale of Trifari, Krussman & Fishel Inc. of New York
were not disclosed.
   Trifari, which has about 1,000 employees, was being sold because
Hallmark wanted to concentrate on larger companies and investments,
said Steve Doyal, a Hallmark spokesman.
   Hallmark bought Trifari in 1975 from the family that started the
company in 1925. At that time, Doyal said Trifari was a good
complement to Hallmark's composition as a greeting card and gift
company.
   Hallmark last year acquired a Spanish language television
network for $300 million. Its other subsidiaries include printing
and graphics companies, Crown Center Redevelopment Corp. and Binney
& Smith Inc., the maker of Crayola crayons.

<HEAD>Sundstrand May Plead Guilty To Defense Overcharging: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp., a major aerospace
contractor, has agreed in principle to plead guilty to filing false
statements with the government and pay $12.5 million for
overcharging on military work, a newspaper reported.
   The proposed plea agreement covers allegations that the
company's Seattle-based Sundstrand Data Control unit improperly
included patent-litigation expenses in overhead costs on government
military contracts, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday,
quoting unidentified sources.
   Sundstrand said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it expected to face unspecified criminal charges in
both Washington state and Illinois in connection with federal grand
jury investigations of its accounting methods for handling
government contracts and tax matters.
   ``The government has advised that it intends to charge the
company with criminal violations in both districts,'' Sundstrand's
filing stated.
   The document also reported that the company, Rockford's largest
employer, was working on a settlement in one, and possibly both, of
the actions.
   Federal charges could lead to the suspension of new government
contracts for Sundstrand, which had $579 million in military sales
in 1987.
   But if the company settled the dispute by paying ``materially
adverse fines and penalties,'' it might be suspended only
temporarily from new government business, according to Sundstrand's
filing.

<TEXT>
   The 12-nation European Economic
Community loses at least $250 billion a year in extra costs and
lost economic opportunities by staying divided along national
borders, a two-year study concludes.
   The study, which was released Tuesday, is designed to give
economic undepinning to the trade bloc's plan to abolish national
frontiers and create a single European market by the end of 1992.
   The report concluded that fusing the economies of the individual
member states into one would add 5 percent to the bloc's gross
domestic product and create up to 5 million new jobs.
   The report was prepared by a team of economists supervised by
Paolo Cecchini, a former senior EEC official,
   Jacques Delors, president of the EEC Executive Commission, said
at a press conference that he hoped the report would launch a
European debate about economic integration. ``We are simply
providing food for thought ... We want to get a debate going,'' he
said.
   He said the purpose of the study was not to provide an economic
forecast, but rather to outline the economic potential of a Europe
united in a single market.
   Lord Arthur Cockfield, the EEC commissioner responsible for the
integration process, gave a more prosaic appraisal of the study:
``We wanted to show there is a lot more juice to be squeezed from
this particular lemon.''
   Pointing to the more than 6,000 pages that the report and its
underlying studies contain, Cockfield said, ``Nothing like it has
ever been done before.''
   He said the results show ``clearly the extent to which the
division of Europe results in non-competitive behavior, missed
opportunities, high unemployment and higher prices.''
   According to the study, the EEC stands to gain from market
integration the equivalent of at least $250 billion a year, largely
by foregoing the cost of border controls and by improving
productivity and competitiveness.
   Abolishing controls and removing non-tariff barriers to trade,
the report concluded, could save up to $99.2 billion and shave as
much as 3.5 percent of the cost of products.
   An additional $75.6 billion could be gained from ``exploiting
economies of scale more fully,'' the report estimated.
   Restoring competition in state-controlled industries and
reducing ``business ineffectiveness'' would add $57 billion in
economic benefits, the report said.
   The study predicted that in addition to boosting output,
employment and the standard of living, the creation of a single
market would ``simultaneously cool the economy, deflating consumer
prices by an average of 6 percent.''
   Deregulation of public transport, the energy industry, banking,
indurance and defence procurement would lead to price cuts of up to
20 percent, the report said.
   The report estimated that market integration alone would add 4.5
percent to the gross domestic product and add 2 million new jobs.
But if combined with tax reduction and increased spending, the
report said, a single market would boost gross domestic product by
7 percent and create 5 million new jobs.
   The report did not estimate which EEC countries would benefit
most from the single market, but said all 12 were likely to ``make
substantial economic gains.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mixed Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans posted losses, most wheat
contracts made slight gains and corn finished nearly unchanged.
   The decline in soybean prices was mostly due to profit-taking
after Monday's sharp advances, analysts said.
   Wheat prices also did an about-face as traders bought contracts
after a fairly steep drop on Monday, said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Contracts for May and July delivery of corn advanced marginally
in reaction to news that the government had granted one-year
extensions on certain corn loans taken out in 1984, 1985 and 1986.
   The extensions mean farmers can delay decisions about marketing
hundreds of millions of bushels of corn that might otherwise have
gone onto the market this year, Lespinasse said.
   Trading volume is expected to drop on Wednesday and Thursday
ahead of two eagerly awaited Agriculture Department reports _ the
annual spring planting intentions report and the quarterly grain
stocks report _ due out after Thursday's close.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.01 a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.11\ a bushel; oats were 1\
cents lower to 3 cents higher with May at $1.63} a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents to 6 cents lower with May at $6.51 a bushel.

   A law that barred publisher Rupert Murdoch
from continuing to own television stations and newspapers in the
same city was struck down today as unconstitutional by a federal
appeals court.
   The divided panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here
voided a provision passed by Congress late last year that would
force Murdoch to sell the Boston Herald or WFXT-TV in that city by
June 30 to comply with rules that forbid single ownership of a
newspaper and a television station in one city.
   The 2-1 court decision does not affect Murdoch's $37 million
sale of the New York Post to real estate developer Peter Kalikow, a
deal that was spurred by the law's enactment as part of a massive
spending bill.
   In his contract to sell the Post, Murdoch retained the right to
make the first offer for the paper if Kalikow should decide to
sell. Howard J. Rubenstein, spokesman for both men, said the
contract obliges Kalikow to allow Murdoch to make a ``first offer''
for the paper, but does not oblige Kalikow to accept it.
   But Lawrence Kessler, general counsel for News America, said
Murdoch was not contemplating repurchasing the Post, which Kalikow
says he is committed to turning into a profitable newspaper.
Kessler also said he was ``heartened and encouraged that the Court
of Appeals shared our concern for the protection of publishers'
constitutional rights.''
   The court's ruling could enable Murdoch to retain temporarily
ownership of both his Boston media outlets if the Federal
Communications Commission extends his waiver from the enforcement
of the common-ownership rule.
   The court ordered the FCC to consider Murdoch's application to
extend the temporary waiver that he has held since 1986.
   Murdoch charged that the law forbidding the FCC to extend his
temporary waivers for both the New York Post and the Boston Herald
was politically motivated and amounted to an unconstitutional
attempt to silence criticism of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., by
the Herald.
   The court ruled that the provision of a massive spending bill
was unconstitutional because it singled out Murdoch's News America
Inc.
   While the court declined to inquire into Congress's motives, it
concluded that the provison ``strikes at Murdoch with the precision
of a laser beam,'' and therefore violates the equal protection
clause of the Constitution.
   The amendment to the spending bill prohibited the FCC from
extending temporary waivers to the common-ownership rules. It was
sponsored by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. and supported by Kennedy.
   The court did not rule on the merits of any claim that Murdoch's
News America Publishing Inc. should retain ownership of both the
Herald and WFXT-TV. But the judges cleared the way for Murdoch to
seek an extension of the June 30 deadline for complying with the
common-ownership rules.
   Murdoch has indicated he wanted to retain the Herald and sell
the television station if forced to do so.
   The court ruled that because Murdoch's company was the sole
holder of temporary waivers specified in the Hollins amendment, the
law was aimed solely at him.
   Because the law appears to serve no legitimate purpose except to
prohibit Murdoch from obtaining extensions of his waivers, it
unconstitutionally singled him out, the court said.
   ``Congress's exclusive focus on a single party clearly
implicates values similar to those behind the constitutional
proscription of Bills of Attainder,'' Judge Stephen Williams wrote
in an opinion joined by Judge Laurence Silberman. Such bills are
aimed at specific individuals.
   ``The safeguards of a pluralistic political system are often
absent when the legislature zeroes in on a small class of
citizens,'' he wrote.
   ``Nowhere are the protections of the equal protection clause
more critical than when legislation singles out one or a few for
uniquely disfavored treatment,'' Williams said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who had the legislation
attached to the spending bill, said in a statement that the court's
decision does not mean Murdoch should retain ownership of his
Boston newspaper and television station.
   ``Nothing in the Constitution or even the court's decision says
that Rupert Murdoch is entitled to be the only newspaper owner in
American who can buy a broadcasting station and keep his newspaper
in the same community,'' Kennedy said.
   He said he continues to believe ``that Congress was on sound
constitutional grounds when it adopted the provision, and that the
right of Congress to take this action will be vindicated by the
Supreme Court if the parties appeal today's decision.''

   A stable dollar and lower interest rates helped
push stock prices sharply higher today, with the Dow Jones
industrial average surpassing the 2,000-mark again.
   The closely watched index of 30 industrial stocks jumped 23.88
to 2,003.65 with an hour to go on Wall Street. On Monday it closed
a scant 0.82 higher, while other indicators registered a loss.
   The broader market also posted gains today. Advancing issues
outpaced declines by 7 to 3 among issues listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,022 up, 443 down, and 472 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 126.78 million shares as of 3
p.m. EST, compared with 118.6 million shares at the same point in
Monday's session.
   Traders said the dollar's improvement in foreign exchange
trading helped stock prices by easing inflation fears and pushing
interest rates lower.
   ``The fact that the dollar has stabilized and is no longer going
into a free-fall, that's a psychological prop,'' said Larry
Wachtel, market strategist and first vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``The market is in an oversold
condition.''
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said a report showing the Index of Leading Indicators _ the
government's chief economic forecsting gauge _ rose 0.9 percent in
February also lent support to stock prices. The index had fallen in
three of the past four months.
   ``Maybe those fears that the economy is going to run out of
steam either this year or next year are unfounded,'' he said.
   Among most actively traded blue-chip issues, American Telephone
and Telegraph rose [ to 26~; IBM fell { to 107|; General Electric
rose [ to 41[; and Exxon was unchanged.
   Texaco rose 3 to 47}, after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said it
intended to buy up to 15 percent of the oil giant's shares.
   RJR Nabisco was up 4] to 52]. The company said it planned to buy
back as much as 8 percent of its stock.
   Lucky Stores jumped 1{ to 50[. American Stores Co. said it was
prepared to raise its offer for Lucky to more than $1.9 billion if
a friendly merger of the two grocery store chains can be achieved.
   The NYSE composite index was up 1.26 at 147.37. At the American
Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.75 to 293.75.

<HEAD>Roper Changes Sides, Recommends GE Instead of Whirlpool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roper Corp.'s board of directors changed
sides Tuesday in the takeover fight for the appliance manufacturer,
saying stockholders should sell to General Electric Co. instead of
Whirlpool Corp.
   Roper's board determined that GE's $508 million tender offer was
clearly superior to Whirlpool's $470 million one, the company said
in withdrawing a recommendation of Whirlpool made March 18.
   ``Discussions with Whirlpool ... have not to date led Whirlpool
to propose an increase in the price offered for Roper shares,''
Roper's statement said.
   The battle began in February when Roper announced it had agreed
to be acquired by Whirlpool for $37.50 for each of Roper's 9.4
million shares outstanding, or about $352.5 million. General
Electric then entered the fray with a bid of $45 per share, or $423
million.
   Both companies have since increased their bids, with GE's
currently at $54 per share and Whirlpool's at $50.
   Whirlpool and GE have filed federal court suits challenging each
others' actions, with GE claiming the Roper board failed to tell
stockholders of an earlier interest in the company and Whirlpool
complaining GE was trying to sabotage an already announced deal.
Hearings are scheduled this week in Whirlpool's suit.
   The board said Roper stockholders should withdraw their shares
already offered to Whirlpool and tender them to GE instead.
   Whirlpool, in a statement issued from its Benton Harbor, Mich.,
headquarters, said the company will continue to pursue Roper.
   ``Our definitive merger agreement with Roper still stands,''
David R. Whitwam, Whirlpool's president, chairman and chief
executive, said in the statement. ``The Roper board's action is
disappointing in light of its corporate charter to consider the
best interests of all constituents. ... However, it is
understandable in view of the current price differential and the
pressures being applied by GE.''
   Roper employs about 4,750 people, 3,000 of them in four Georgia
plants. In addition to electric and gas appliances, the company
manufactures tillers, lawn mowers and lawn and garden tractors. Its
customers include Sears Roebuck & Co., the nation's largest
retailer.
   It also manufactures some GE ranges, and the Fairfield,
Conn.-based company has said its interest in Roper stems from that
association.
   Roper had net income of $24 million on $703 million in sales for
the fiscal year ended July 31.
   GE, which also has financial and broadcasting interests, had
1987 revenues of $40.5 billion and net income of $2.9 billion. Its
major appliance business was responsible for $4.72 billion in
revenue and a pretax operating profit of $490 million.
   Whirlpool had $4.2 billion in sales last year.

<HEAD>Odyssey Ups Bid for Stevens; West Point-Pepperell Expected To
Counter</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will be updated with closing stock price.</NOTE>

   Odyssey Partners sweetened its tender offer for
J.P. Stevens & Co. to $1.14 billion Tuesday, but analysts predicted
further bidding in the battle for the textile giant.
   West Point-Pepperell Inc., which has made a $1.1 billion bid for
Stevens, is expected to compete fiercely for the crown jewels _
three state-of-the-art factories and licenses for hot designer
labels that lure consumers around the world to Stevens' quality
sheets and towels.
   Odyssey, a New York investment firm, said it would pay $64 for
each of Stevens' 17.8 million outstanding shares, up from the
$61.50-a-share tender offer Stevens' management accepted earlier
this month.
   In ``consideration'' for the sweetened offer, Stevens' board
agreed to pay Odyssey up to $8 million if it is acquired by a third
party for more than $64 a share.
   Pepperell made its $62.50-a-share bid after Stevens forged its
agreement with Odyssey. Pepperell had said it might be willing to
increase its offer to $64 a share if Stevens agreed to a friendly
deal.
   A spokesman at Pepperell's headquarters in West Point, Ga., had
no comment after Odyssey announced its increased offer.
   But asked in an interview last week whether Pepperell would
consider raising its offer above the conditional $64 a share,
Chairman Joseph L. Lanier said, ``I wouldn't preclude it.''
   In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens
rose 37{ cents to $64.87{a share.
   Odyssey partner Brian D. Young noted in a statement that while
Odyssey's bid matched what Pepperell said it was prepared to pay
under friendly terms, Odyssey's tender offer expires on April 11 _
10 days ahead of Pepperell's offer.
   Investors are likely to find the earlier expiration attractive
unless Pepperell raises its bid.
   ``West Point-Pepperell wants Stevens very badly,'' said George
Zimmerman, director of research at Gruntal & Co.
   The acquisition would quickly further Pepperell in its goal of
becoming a major international marketer of branded products.
   ``Not only does Stevens have some of the best brand names in the
business, but they have bigger international operations,
particularly in Canada and Japan,'' said Josephine Esquivel, a
textile analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Pepperell's brands include Arrow, Martex, Lady Pepperell and
Burberrys. Among Stevens' arsenal of top designer names are Ralph
Lauren, Laura Ashley, Pierre Cardin, Vanderbilt, Perry Ellis and
Givenchy.
   In addition to the attraction of the licenses to use those
names, Pepperell is keen on acquiring Stevens' sheet plant in
Clemson, S.C., and two top towel plants in Wagram, N.C., analysts
agreed.
   How much higher Pepperell can go is another matter. Esquivel
noted that the company's debt-to-equity ratio, currently at 28
percent, would jump to 63 percent based on a $64-a-share tender
offer.
   Odyssey's Young has charged that a Pepperell merger with Stevens
would violate antitrust laws.
   Pepperell has sought to soothe potential antitrust concerns with
a plan that includes the sale of half of Stevens' bath lines and 20
percent of its sheet lines for about $170 million. Pepperell signed
a definitive agreement for the sale with NTC Group, parent of Bibb
Co., a textile manufacturer.
   But Young said the proposed sale to Bibb ``does not cure the
antitrust problems.'' He said Odyssey will ``strongly present our
views to the appropriate governmental authorities and will continue
to oppose any amended proposal if we believe that the antitrust
problems have not been solved.''
   Bidding for Stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout
offer several weeks ago from a group led by its own senior
management, including Chairman Whitney Stevens _ a fifth-generation
member of the family that founded the company in 1813.
   The management group initially offered $43 a share and later
sweetened its bid to $55 a share in cash and securities. In a
leveraged buyout, a company is acquired largely with borrowed money
repaid with a target company's profits or the sale of assets.

   New home sales, which had fallen for three
months following the October collapse of the stock market, soared
20.3 percent in February, the fastest increase in almost two years,
the government said Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said that new single-family homes were
sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 628,000 units. It was
the first monthly increase since a 1.4 percent rise in October, but
it still left sales 14.9 percent below where they were a year ago.
   Sales had fallen 10.3 percent in January, 6.8 percent in
December and 4.2 percent in November, declines which analysts had
blamed on high mortgage rates and consumer jitters following the
record plunge in stock prices that occurred on Oct. 19.
   Because housing is often the first sector to weaken at the start
of a new recession, the string of declines had raised concerns
about whether another downturn was imminent.
   But analysts said the strong February rebound erased those
worries and indicated housing should strengthen further in coming
months.
   ``The February numbers spell relief and optimism,'' said David
Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home
Builders. ``We feel we are back on track where we should be.''
   James Christian, chief economist of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions, said the February housing performance ``is another
piece of evidence that we are shrugging off the aftershocks from
the stock market crash.''
   Christian predicted that new home sales would rise further
during the spring sales season and help boost sales for the entire
year to around 650,000. While that would be down from the 671,000
new homes sold in 1987, it would still be considered a strong sales
year for the industry.
   Analysts said it is unlikely that mortgage rates will fall much
further. Fixed-rate mortgages currently stand at 9.99 percent, down
from a high last year of 11.58 percent just before the stock market
decline.
   Economists predicted rates would begin rising later this spring
and would probably top 11 percent by the end of the year.
   ``The economy is too strong and the dollar is too weak to
believe that interest rates will go down from here,'' said Martin
Regalia, chief economist of the National Council of Savings
Institutions.
   The big February sales rebound was the largest monthly increase
since a 21 percent gain in March 1986. It was accompanied by a
sharp decline in prices, reflecting in part the re-entry into the
market of first-time buyers, who normally buy less expensive homes.
   The median, or mid-point, price of new homes was $110,800 in
February, down 6.1 percent from the record January price of
$118,000.
   The average price of a new home fell 4.6 percent to $139,000
last month, down from $145,700 in January.
   The big jump in sales was propelled by a 42.9 percent surge in
sales in the South. This region of the country, which accounts for
40 percent of all new homes sold, is still 9.6 percent below the
year-earlier sales pace.
   Sales were up 29.3 percent in the Northeast and 18.2 percent in
the Midwest. The West was the only region of the country to suffer
a sales decline in February, a drop of 7.1 percent.

<HEAD>Sundstrand Anticipates Filing of Criminal Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sundstrand Corp. has agreed in principle
to plead guilty to filing false statements with the government and
to pay $12.5 million in connection with alleged overcharges on
defense contracts, according to published reports Tuesday.
   Sundstrand Corp., an aerospace contractor, previously revealed
in a financial filing with the government that it would face
criminal charges resulting from two federal grand jury
investigations into alleged overcharges.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Sundstrand had
agreed to the guilty plea and payment in one of those
investigations and that Justice Department officials hoped to gain
an agreement in the second, larger investigation.
   Sundstrand reported a year ago that the government was seeking
repayment of $13.5 million plus interest and $102.9 million plus
interest in two separate disputes over contract pricing.
   The Journal said the two cases, taken together, could result in
the largest total payment ever for alleged military contracting
fraud.
   Claude Bernam, a spokesman for Sundstrand, referred inquiries
about the investigations to the company's lawyers, who were not
available for comment.
   In a report filed recently with the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission, Sundstrand acknowledged the ``government has
advised that it intends to charge the company with criminal
violations'' in both Rockford and Seattle.
   Sundstrand is based in Rockford and operates a subsidiary in
Redmond, Wash., near Seattle, that is part of its Advanced
Technology Group.
   Sundstrand, which makes flight data equipment, engine start-up
systems and other electronic equipment for commercial and military
aircraft, said in its SEC filing that it was ``in the process of
entering a settlement in one or possibly both actions.''
   Such settlements, the company also noted in the filing, ``could
result in the imposition of materially adverse fines and
penalties.''
   In the Seattle case, the newspaper said Sundstrand failed to
disclose improper accounting procedures during negotiations with
the Defense Department. In the Rockford case, Sundstrand allegedly
charged private commercial costs to Air Force and Navy contracts
and subcontracts.
   Sundstrand's military sales last year amounted to $574 million
and accounted for more than half of all sales in the aerospace
segment.
   In 1986, Sundstrand put aside $61.5 million to cover settlement
and legal expenses relating to the government disputes. As a
result, 1986 profits were down 39 percent.
   One analyst said Sundstrand has the market presence to weather a
temporary halt in government business.
   ``The question is, is this jeopardizing on a long-term basis,''
said Steven Colbert, at Prudential-Bache Securities. ``The answer
right now is, `I don't think so.' Right now they have very strong
market share.''

   The stock market pulled out of its slump today,
bolstered by a more stable dollar, lower interest rates and some
positive news about the economy.
   Analysts, however, were uncertain whether today's broad-based
rally represented a bullish trend or just a much-needed respite
following three sessions of losses.
   ``In light of what we've seen in the equity market today ...
much of this action is almost like an oversold bounce,'' said
Dennis E. Jarrett, a technical analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Co.
``It's too early to say whether it's sustainable.''
   The dollar's improvement in foreign exchange trading helped
stock prices by easing inflation fears and pushing interest rates
lower, analysts said. A sharp decline in the U.S. currency had been
largely responsible for driving down the stock market on Monday.
   ``The fact that the dollar has stabilized and is no longer going
into a free-fall, that's a psychological prop,'' said Larry
Wachtel, market strategist and first vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The dollar was aided today by central bank intervention and
remarks from Japan's foreign minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, who called
for major industrialized nations to follow last year's currency
stabilization accord.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said a report showing the Index of Leading Indicators _ the
government's chief economic forecsting gauge _ gained 0.9 percent
in February also lent support to stock prices. The index had fallen
in three of the past four months.
   ``Maybe those fears that the economy is going to run out of
steam either this year or next year are unfounded,'' Johnson said.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Union-Sought Bill To Warn Workers Of Job Hazards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday effectively rejected
legislation to warn up to 300,000 workers a year they risk cancer
and other diseases from occupational exposure to toxic chemicals.
   On a 52-42 vote, Senate sponsors of the House-passed measured
failed by 18 of the 60 votes necessary on a fourth attempt to break
off a conservative Republican filibuster over the past eight days
against the union-sought bill.
   The bill's author, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, conceded
defeat but said the issue will not go away.
   ``In this one I've lost,'' he said. ``But as long as workers are
kept in the dark about occupational hazards, we will continue to
try to bring them light.'
   The defeat was the first for the AFL-CIO on the Senate floor
since helping return the 100-member body to Democratic control. But
15 of the Senate's 54 Democrats, most of them from the South, ended
up siding with the leader of the filibuster, Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah.
   ``We've had 50 years of these type of give-away programs that
don't work,'' said Hatch, who claimed the measure could cost
businesses up to $7 billion if exposed workers began filing and
winning liability suits against their current and former employers.
   The bill was aimed at addressing what the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health estimates is one in every four
Americans who has been exposed to carcinogens at work, most of them
unaware of it.
   Metzenbaum, the measure's chief sponsor, repeatedly cited
American Cancer Society estimates that warnings to at-risk workers
could have saved 250,000 lives over the next 10 years.
   ``Tens of thousands of American workers are dying each year from
occupational diseases and could prevent many of these deaths ... by
telling them the truth that they are at risk,'' he said.
   Metzenbaum accused the National Association of Manufacturers and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce of waging an ``orchestrated campaign
of misrepresentation, innuendo and hype'' in citing the potential
costs to employers.
   Alexander Trowbridge, the NAM's president, called Metzenbaum's
charge ``irresponsible,'' saying worker health is a prime concern
of every responsible manager in the country.
   ``We care a great deal about preventing disease from happening
rather than discovering it after the fact, which is what his
proposal would bring about,'' Trowbridge said.
   The bill would have established a panel of seven scientific
experts to identify the most hazardous substances in workplaces and
the groups of employees most susceptible to disabling diseases
because of exposure to them.
   NIOSH would have been required to individually notify between
100,000 and 300,000 of those at-risk workers every year at an
annual cost of $25 million. Employers then would be required to
finance medical monitoring program for them at a cost of up to $250
each annually.
   If a physician recommended transferring a monitored employee to
less hazardous work, he or she would have had to be paid the same
level of wages and benefits to them in the new job. If no other job
is available, the employee would have been entitled to full wages
for up to a year after leaving work.
   In addition to unions, the bill was supported by public health
and environmental groups, the chemical and electronic industries
and several giant companies, most of which have instituted such
notification programs on their own.

   Congress unconstitutionally singled out
publisher Rupert Murdoch by prohibiting his continued ownership of
newspapers and television stations in the same city, an appeals
court ruled Tuesday.
   A recently enacted provision barring the Federal Communications
Commission from extending temporary waivers from its
cross-ownership rule is unconstitutional because it ``strikes at
Murdoch with the precision of a laser beam'' without a legitimate
purpose, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington ruled in a
2-1 opinion.
   The law violates the the Constitution's equal protection clause
as well as the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press,
the court said.
   The decision means Murdoch may petition the FCC to extend past
June 30 the waiver that allows his News American Publishing Inc. to
own both the Boston Herald and that city's WFXT-TV.
   Murdoch also had sought an extension of a waiver that allowed
him to own both the New York Post and WNYW-TV until March 6, but
the newspaper was sold earlier this month for $37 million to real
estate developer Peter Kalikow. The decision, therefore, won't
affect the Post's sale.
   Lawrence Kessler, general counsel for News America, said Murdoch
has no plans to repurchase the newspaper in light of the court's
ruling.
   The provision that banned the cross-ownership waiver extension
had been tucked quietly into a massive spending bill last December
by Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   In its ruling Tuesday, the court said the ban was so narrowly
drawn that it applied only to Murdoch _ who held the only two
waivers from the cross-ownership rule.
   The court is saying Congress ``should not enact legislation that
is aimed in a punitive way at a single individual,'' said Howard
Squadron, a New York attorney who argued the case for News America.
   ``I would think it's a benefit to all people who enjoy the First
Amendment freedom,'' Squadron said.
   Howard Rubinstein, a spokesman for both News America and
Kalikow, said News America was ``gratified'' with the court's
ruling and that Kalikow has instructed his attorneys to seek to
purchase a radio station or television station in New York City. He
would not name stations.
   Rubinstein said Kalikow will challenge the cross-ownership rule
itself because he believes the reasons for the rule no longer exist
since there are an ample number of radio and televison stations.
   The FCC, which defended the law's constitutionality but not the
policy it enacted, appeared as pleased with the decision as
Murdoch's lawyers.
   ``The court by this decision has demonstrated that the Congress
does not have a free hand in the regulation of the broadcast
press,'' FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said in a statement. ``I am
pleased the court will hold the Congress to a higher standard when
First Amendment freedoms are implicated.''
   The court did not specify how the commission should rule on
Murdoch's request for an extension except to say political pressure
from Congress should ``play no role in agency adjudications
involving important constitutional rights.''
   The court found that the law had no other purpose than to
prohibit extensions of the waivers and therefore unconstitutionally
targeted a specific individual for no legitimate purpose, the court
said.
   ``Congress's exclusive focus on a single party clearly
implicates values similar to those behind the constitutional
prosription of Bills of Attainders,'' Judge Stephen Williams wrote
in an opinion joined by Judge Laurence Silberman. Bills of
attainder are aimed at specific people.
   Murdoch and some politicians had criticized the ban as an
attempt to muzzle the conservative editorial policies of the
newspapers, particularly the Herald, which repeatedly has been
critical of Kennedy.
   Kennedy and Hollings, however, said they merely were trying to
force Murdoch to comply with rules that other publishers must
observe.
   In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy said the court's decision does
not mean Murdoch should retain ownership of his Boston newspaper
and television station.
   ``Nothing in the Constitution or even the court's decision says
that Rupert Murdoch is entitled to be the only newspaper owner in
American who can buy a broadcasting station and keep his newspaper
in the same community,'' Kennedy said.
   He said he believed Congress ``will be vindicated by the Supreme
Court if the parties appeal today's decision.''
   Hollings, meanwhile, said the court ``has arrested the policeman
on the beat, while the culprit has gone free.'' He called the
decision a ``legal contortion'' that ``set up Murdoch for special
treatment.''
   While the court did not speculate on the senators' motives, it
noted the provision did not bar new temporary waivers that are
normally extended to give a company time to divest itself of a TV
station or newspaper acquired during a merger or acquisition.
   Nor did Congress mention waivers from the cross-ownership rules,
the court said.
   In dissent, Circuit Judge Spotswood Robinson said ``Congress
pursued a wholly legitimate purpose when it acted to protect the
cross-ownership rule from circumvention or erosion.''
   Even though a statute so narrowly drawn ``naturally arouses
suspicions about its legal propriety,'' Robinson concluded that
Congress ``selected a method that was more than adequately related
to the purpose it sought to achieve.''
   The issue arose last fall when the FCC was asked in a petition
to consider abolishing the cross-ownership rule. The FCC said it
would solicit comments on the idea but the law's enactment barred
the agency from taking further action during the current fiscal
year.
   Murdoch, meanwhile, has indicated he would keep the Herald and
sell his Boston TV outlet if the FCC forces him to divest one of
the properties.

   A stable dollar, lower interest rates and some
positive news about the economy helped push the slumping stock
market broadly higher Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed up 18.57 to
1,998.34, after venturing across the 2,000-mark during the
afternoon. The closely watched index had lost more than 80 points
since Thursday.
   The broader market also gained ground Tuesday. About 13 stocks
rose in value for every six that fell on the New York Stock
Exchange, with 1,015 up, 467 down and 482 unchanged.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates 500 Equity Index, stocks
gained $18.5 billion in value.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 152.69 million shares, higher
than the 142.82 million shares that changed hands in the previous
session.
   Stock prices started out on a strong note with the help of the
dollar's advance in foreign exchange, which, in turn, eased
inflation fears and pushed interest rates lower. A sharp decline in
the U.S. currency had been largely responsible for the market's
recent losses.
   ``The fact that the dollar has stabilized and is no longer going
into a free-fall, that's a psychological prop,'' said Larry
Wachtel, market strategist and first vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The dollar was aided in part by reports of central bank
intervention.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said a report showing the Index of Leading Indicators _ the
government's chief economic forecasting gauge _ gained 0.9 percent
in February also lent support to stock prices. The index had fallen
in three of the past four months.
   ``Maybe those fears that the economy is going to run out of
steam either this year or next year are unfounded,'' Johnson said.
   Analysts said they were uncertain whether Tuesday's rally
represented a bullish trend or just a much-needed respite following
three disappointing sessions.
   ``In light of what we've seen in the equity market today ...
much of this action is almost like an oversold bounce,'' said
Dennis E. Jarrett, a technical analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Co.
``It's too early to say whether it's sustainable.''
   Among most actively traded blue-chip issues, American Telephone
and Telegraph was up [ at 26~; IBM fell 2\ to 105~; General
Electric rose [ to 41[; and Exxon was down \ to 42].
   Texaco jumped 3\ to 48, after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said it
would seek federal permission to buy up to 15 percent of the oil
giant's shares.
   RJR Nabisco was up 4[ to 52[. The company said it planned to buy
back as much as 8 percent of its stock.
   Lucky Stores rose 1\ to 49~. American Stores Co. said it was
prepared to raise its offer for Lucky to more than $1.9 billion if
a friendly merger of the two grocery store chains can be achieved.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 178.58 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index climbed 1.11 to 147.22.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 2.62 to 301.70,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.01 to 260.07.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index stood at
294.33, up 2.33. The NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market closed at 372.96, up 2.54.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises on Central Bank Purchases; Gold Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged upward Tuesday from its lowest
point since early January, responding favorably to reports of
modest efforts by central banks to support it.
   Gold prices edged higher. Republic National Bank of New York
said gold was bid at $455.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from
$455.10 late Monday.
   There were conflicting reports on the extent of intervention by
central banks, although traders agreed the Bank of Japan bought
some dollars with yen in the Tokyo market.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also bought dollars
Tuesday, said David H. Arbesman, president of Kemper Currency Inc.
   The rally generated by reports of the central banks' action
squeezed out investors who had bet on further declines in the
dollar, forcing them to buy dollars to cover borrowed positions,
Arbesman said.
   Traders who bought dollars were pushing aside the concerns that
have sent the dollar lower the past several weeks. The dollar
closed Monday at its lowest levels since the first week in January
against major currencies.
   The bearish factors include ``disenchantment with anything being
really done about the budget, the fear of renewed inflation, and
the fear of another stock market collapse,'' Arbesman said.
   ``Those are all really still in the backs of people's minds, but
they're taking a back seat,'' he said.
   The dollar showed little reaction to reports Tuesday that the
government's chief economic forecasting gauge rose 0.9 percent in
February and sales of new homes shot up 20.3 percent, said David
Godwin, chief foreign exchange dealer for the Union Bank of
Switzerland in New York.
   The British pound was bolstered by rumors, later firmly denied,
that British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had resigned
and by a statement by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that keeping
inflation down was the government's top priority.
   Lawson, whose job is equivalent to the U.S. secretary of the
treasury, reportedly has been arguing against allowing the pound to
continue its recent rise against other currencies.
   In London, the pound rose to $1.8705 from $1.8590 Monday. Later,
in New York, the pound fell to $1.8642 from $1.8705.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar fell 0.06 yen to a closing 124.37 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 124.50 yen. At the end of the trading day in New
York, the dollar jumped to 125.26 from 123.84 late Monday.
   Other dollar rates late Tuesday in New York, compared with late
Monday, included: 1.6693 West German marks, up from 1.6562; 1.3768
Swiss francs, up from 1.3652; 1.2360 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2372; 5.6505 French francs, up from 5.6130; and 1,236 Italian
lire, up from 1,226.
   Other dollar rates late Tuesday in Europe, compared with late
Monday, included: 1.6610 West German marks, up from 1.6605; 1.3735
Swiss francs, up from 1.3705; 5.6280 French francs, up from 5.6275;
1.8690 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8685; 1,232.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,231.00; and 1.2363 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2377.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery was bid at $455.40 a troy ounce, down 40 cents from late
Monday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $454.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $454.00. In Zurich, gold was higher,
closing at a bid $455 compared with $453.50 late Monday. Earlier,
in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.21 to close at a bid $456.88.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market, where silver
traded at a late bid price of $6.69 a troy ounce, compared with
Monday's $6.63. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery was bid at $6.705 a troy ounce, up 4 cents from Monday.

<HEAD>Platinum Surges On Economic Strength, S. African Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices surged $7 a troy ounce Tuesday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange as the economic outlook continued to
brighten and racial unrest in South Africa prompted fears of supply
disruptions, analysts said.
   On other exchanges, gold futures retreated while silver
advanced; energy futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were
mixed; livestock and meat were mostly lower; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Platinum prices have been gradually re-establishing their
traditional dominance over gold after falling to an even par with
the yellow metal late last year, when recession fears were
widespread.
   Although it is considered a precious metal, platinum is also an
industrial base metal and is more widely used by industry than gold.
   ``In a healthy economy, platinum is likely to do better than
gold,'' said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``The economic activity we've seen in
the last couple of months is very positive for platinum.''
   Tuesday's government report showing a 0.9 percent increase in
February in the index of leading economic indicators further
dispelled fears that the October stock market collapse was a
harbinger of recession, Sloane said.
   Most platinum comes from South Africa, and a recent upswing in
violence there sparked fears of supply problems that helped support
platinum prices, said Peter Cardillo, commodity futures trading
adviser for Josephthal & Co. in New York.
   Platinum settled $7 to $8.30 higher with the contract for
delivery in April at $518.70 a troy ounce.
   Tuesday's economic data had little impact on gold and silver
futures prices, which registered only slight moves on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with April at $455.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with March at
$6.705 a troy ounce.
   Indications of continued overproduction by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries sent crude oil futures prices sliding
lower in light trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, said
Michael Rothman, senior energy strategist for Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets.
   In addition, the market was skeptical that an OPEC meeting next
month will produce support for a production cut, Rothman said.
   Heating oil futures prices also declined while unleaded gasoline
gained a bit.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower across
the board with May at at $16.98 a barrel; heating oil was .02 cent
to .40 cent lower with April at 48.15 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent lower to .24 cent higher with April at 48.26
cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures settled lower on the Chicago Board of Trade but
the grains finished nearly unchanged.
   The decline in soybean prices was mostly due to profit-taking
after Monday's sharp advances, said Victor Lespinasse, a trader for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Contracts for May and July delivery of corn advanced slightly in
reaction to news that the government had granted one-year
extensions on certain corn loans taken out in 1984, 1985 and 1986.
   The extensions mean farmers can delay decisions about marketing
hundreds of millions of bushels of corn that might otherwise have
gone onto the market this year.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $3.01
a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $2.11{
a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with May at $1.63} a
bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 7{ cents lower with May at $6.50\
a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in position-evening ahead of Thursday's
quarterly USDA hogs and pigs report and the three-day Easter
weekend.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .40 cent lower with April at 75.42
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .55 cent lower with
March at 82.82 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to .13 cent
higher with April at 45.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
unchanged to .55 cent lower with May at 55.90 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .05 point higher at 259.95. The underlying
spot index gained 2.01 points to close at 260.07.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge shook off the October stock market slump to post a 0.9
percent increase in February in a performance which analysts said
should lay to rest fears of a 1988 recession.
   In a second upbeat economic report Tuesday, the government said
that sales of new homes, which had fallen for three consecutive
months, shot up 20.3 percent in February, the biggest monthly gain
in almost two years.
   The positive economic news helped pull the stock market out of
its slump in a broad-based rally. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 18.57 points to 1,998.34, following steep declines
last Thursday and Friday and a fractional gain in Monday's session.
   Share prices also were bolstered by a more stable dollar and
lower interest rates. The U.S. currency surged upward from its
lowest point since early January, responding favorably to reports
of modest efforts by central banks to support it. The dollar jumped
to 125.26 Japanese yen in late New York trading from 123.84 yen
late Monday.
   Interest rates declined, meanwhile, as bond prices rose. The
Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped about ~ point, or
$8.75 for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves
inversely to its price, tumbled to 8.75 percent from 8.83 percent
late Monday.
   Weakness in home sales and in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators in the months following the Oct. 19 stock market crash
had raised fears that the five-year-old economic recovery was in
imminent danger of collapsing.
   Housing is often the first sector to weaken in a new downturn
and the index of leading indicators is designed to forecast turning
points in the economy. For that reason, the February rebounds in
both were greeted as good news by economists.
   ``I think we can pretty well bury the recession fears,'' said
Robert Dederick, executive vice president of Northern Trust Co. of
Chicago. ``We have dodged the bullet from the stock market decline.
The economy seems to be getting its second wind.''
   Similarly, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the index
``shows that the economy is very promising. The size and
broad-based nature of last month's index of leading indicators are
encouraging.''
   The 0.9 percent rise in the leading index was the biggest
advance since a 1 percent rise last June. The index had fallen in
three of the past four months, including declines of 0.1 percent in
October, 1.2 percent in November and 1.1 percent in January.
   Only a 0.4 percent increase in December kept the index from
posting a string of three or more consecutive declines, which is
often viewed as a harbinger of a recession.
   Analysts said the declines were correctly signalling slower
growth this year than in 1987. But they said the economy should
strengthen as it moves into the spring.
   ``The first quarter economic slowdown will be brief and mild and
the fundamental strengths of the economy will emerge as the months
go on,'' said Lyle Gramley, chief economist for the Mortgage
Bankers Association.
   Gramley predicted that the economy, as measured by the gross
national product, would rise 2.7 percent this year, an even more
optimistic outlook than the administration's prediction of 2.4
percent growth.
   More than half of the strength in the leading index in February
came from a big jump in building permit applications.
   Analysts said the increase in building permits, after three
months of declines, reflected optimism on the part of builders that
home sales would strengthen because of declining mortgage rates.
   In the report on home sales, the Commerce Department said new
single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 628,000 units last month, the first advance since October and
the biggest gain since March 1986.
   ``The housing rebound suggests that the October crash worries
have been shaken off,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The
Boston Co. ``We have good fundamentals on consumer spending and
consumer confidence because of strong employment growth and strong
growth in disposable incomes.''
   In all, five of the available nine indicators were positive
forces on the leading index in February. After building permits,
the sources of strength came from a drop in unemployment claims, a
rise in stock prices, faster growth of the money supply and a rise
in consumer goods orders.
   Four indicators held the index back. The biggest negative factor
was a decline in the length of the manufacturing workweek, followed
by a decline in orders for plant and equipment, a change in raw
materials prices and a speed-up in business delivery times,
considered a negative because it is often a sign of dropping demand.
   The various changes left the index at 190.6 percent of its 1967
base of 100.
   ``Right now the economy is looking a lot better than we thought
it was going to look three months ago,'' said David Wyss, an
economist with Data Resources Inc., of Lexington, Mass.
   At the end of last year, some analysts had feared the economy
could suffer a decline in the GNP in the first three months of this
year, something that has not occurred since the end of the 1981-82
recession. They feared that a big run-up in unsold goods would
cause production cutbacks and rising unemployment at manufacturing
plants.
   While there have been some production declines, notably in the
auto industry, employment has risen sharply in the first two months
of the year, pushing the jobless rate down to an 8{-year low of 5.7
percent in February.

angry Easter vacationers in airports around Europe on Tuesday, an
official of the carrier said.
   The Spanish-based airline Spantax, which is about $88 million in
debt, closed operations after it ran out of money and couldn't find
new investors, said Pedro Caro, the carrier's director of sales.
   About 100 employees protested the shutdown by blocking entry
roads as 1,000 passengers waited anxiously for flights at Son Sant
Joan Airport in Palma, the capital of this Mediterranean island
where the company is based.
   Caro said there was ``absolute chaos'' at the airport.
   Late Tuesday, airport official Fernando Echegarray said most of
the passengers stranded on this island were able to leave on
substitute flights.
   About 6,000 passengers were expected to be stranded at other
airports in Spain, Finland, Denmark and Italy, Caro had said
earlier.
   ``There aren't enough airplanes in all of Europe to resolve
this,'' Caro said.
   He said the situation was expected to get worse this weekend at
the height of the Easter vacation boom.
   ``By Sunday I'll be hiding under the bed,'' he said.
   Echegarray said tour operators made arrangements for Palma
passengers originally scheduled to fly on seven incoming and seven
outgoing Spantax flights, all canceled Tuesday. Spantax had 30
routes.
   He said charter airlines Air Europa, Canafrica and TAE arranged
to carry Spantax passengers. Some passengers booked on a flight
from Palma to Barcelona on the Spanish mainland were to travel by
boat, Echegarray said.
   He said passengers reserved on a 6 a.m. plane Tuesday to
Helsinki were expected to reach the Finnish capital early Wednesday.
   In Madrid, a spokesman for a tour operator said 350 people
scheduled to fly Spantax to New York Tuesday were to leave
Wednesday morning on another airline.
   Earlier, Antenna 3 radio reported in Madrid that the passengers
there staged a protest after being told their flight was canceled.
   On Tuesday, Spantax chairman Wolfgang Krauss told the company's
800 employees they would not be paid at the end of the month.
   ``There's no money to keep operating and no investors,'' the
Spanish national news agency EFE quoted Krauss as saying. The
employees rejected Krauss' appeal that they work unpaid for a
48-hour period.
   According to Caro, the company's revenues totaled $150 million
in 1987.
   In 1982, 51 people died and 121 were injured when a Spantax
DC-10 crashed while taking off from the Mediterranean coastal city
of Malaga.

   First City Bancorporation of Texas Inc. debt
holders balked for a third time at tendering securities for a loss
Tuesday and officials responded by granting another extension and
cutting its compliance goal for a federally assisted bailout.
   Chicago investor A. Robert Abboud, who would become chairman
under the bailout plan, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
decided to modifiy the tender offer to 70 percent for the
outstanding unsecured publicly held securities of First City.
   ``Under the modification, the 90 percent minimum tender
requirement has been eliminated,'' said First City spokesman Jim
Day. ``But we still hope to get 90 percent. Actually we'd like to
get 100 percent.
   ``What we're saying is that we can get to 70 percent and still
close and the projections of the company will be the same.''
   Another condition under the modification is that the new First
City entity at the time of closing not differ materially from what
was originally planned because of the lower participation level,
Day said.
   In addition, the terms of the offer have been amended to include
payment of accrued interest on tendered debt securities through the
date of acceptance and payment by First City acquisition of such
tendered securities.
   Houston-based First City also extended the deadline for the
tender offer until April 12. The deadline now has been extended
four times.
   As of Tuesday, First City's third deadline, 62 percent, or $140
million, of bank's $225.8 million in bonds had been tendered. Only
51 percent, or $115 million, were tendered by an earlier March 15
deadline.
   The deadline for debt holders was extended to March 15 when only
41.4 percent _ or $93.6 million _ was redeemed for cash by the
first deadline of March 8.
   Under the arrangement, First City senior debt holders have been
offered 45 cents on the dollar for their debt, while subordinated
debt holders have been offered 35 cents.
   ``Since the current reorganization is the only open-bank
proposal being considered by the FDIC, it is unlikely under any
alternative that holders of First City subordinated debt would
receive anything for their interests: Holders of First City senior
public debt would in all likelihood receive, at best, only a
fraction of the amounts represented by their securities,'' Abboud
said Tuesday.
   Wall Street sources have said that almost $55 million of the
outstanding bonds can be traced to arbitragers holding out for a
sweetened offer.
   First City, with 59 banks in Texas and one in South Dakota, grew
quickly during the Texas oil boom, but was hammered by energy and
real estate losses when oil prices plummeted. For 1987, the company
posted a $1.1 billion loss.
   The bailout plan for Texas' fourth-largest bank holding company
calls for $970 million in assistance from the FDIC, $500 million
infusion of capital raised privately by an investor group headed by
Abboud and a spinoff of $1.79 billion in book value of poorly
performing assets.
   On March 4, more than 71 percent of the Houston-based company's
37 million shareholders approved the controversial bailout.
   Other options available to the FDIC, analysts say, include
canceling the Abboud deal and reopening bidding for the bank, or
having the FDIC itself take over First City.
