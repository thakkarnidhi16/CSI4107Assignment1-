   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said
Monday night he will extend a year-old inflation-fighting program
through the first half of 1989, institute a gradual peso devaluation
and allow an 8 percent pay increase for workers.
   The increase will be the workers' first in nine months.
   In a Monday night ceremony with business and labor leaders,
Salinas also gave the program a new name: the Economic Growth and
Stability Pact.
   Former President Miguel de la Madrid implemented the plan, then
known as the Economic Solidarity Pact, in December 1987 as inflation
reached a record annual rate of 159.2 percent.
   Inflation reached 48.6 percent for the first 11 months of 1988,
according to the central bank.
   The central features of the plan included freezes enacted Feb. 29
on the peso currency exchange rate and on prices for
government-regulated goods and services.
   The government also froze the daily minimum wage, which in the
Federal District of Mexico City amounted to about $3.70.
   On Jan. 1, the government will begin adjusting the peso-dollar
exchange rate by an average of one peso per day through July 31,
1989, the statement said.
   It said the controlled devaluation will occur ``at a rhythm that
continues to make possible for those making their investments in
pesos a better yield than that obtained using other currencies.''
   The measure will be implemented ``without abandoning the
objective of stabilizing the exchange rate during the year,'' the
statement added.

<HEAD>Soldiers To Get 20 Percent Pay Raise This Month, Plus Bonus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The armed forces will receive pay
raises of 20 percent in December with a $100 bonus, an official
report said Monday.
   Soldiers who mounted a four-day uprising this month had demanded
raises.
   The government's news agency, Telam, cited ``reliable sources''
for its report of the raises. It gave no details in its
two-paragraph story.
   The military uprising broke out at a base on the outskirts of the
capital on Dec. 1 and moved to another base nearby before the
mutineers agreed to return to their units. The revolt left three
people dead.
   Civilian President Raul Alfonsin denied reports at the time that
he was forced to make concessions in exchange for the surrender of
the rebellious troops.
   Soldiers have complained that they _ like other public employees
_ have lost significant purchasing power as raises failed to keep
pace with increases in the cost of living.
   The military received a 30 percent raise in July and 12 percent
in October. The cost of living rose by 26 percent in July and 9
percent in October.
   The latest raise would be well ahead of inflation, which last
month increased by 6 percent.
   The government has tried to control military salaries partly in
an effort to harness inflation. In addition, the opposition Peronist
Party in Congress has blocked the 1988 budget because it wants more
federal funds for the provinces.
   The military share of the total budget has shrunk to about 2
percent of gross domestic product from about 4 percent during
military dictatorships of 1976-83.

   A convict dubbed the ``traveling
rapist'' received a stay of execution late Monday for the
rape-murder of a 19-year-old woman, but a second man was still
slated to be put to death by injection early Tuesday for the killing
of a restaurateur.
   The high court granted an application for a stay of execution for
Samuel Hawkins late Monday, hours after turning down a similar
request from Raymond Landry, whose execution was still scheduled for
after midnight.
   U.S. Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said the application
was filed at 9:30 p.m. EST and the order sparing Hawkins was entered
at 10:25 p.m. with Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Byron
White dissenting. He was sentenced to death for the 1976
rape-slaying of a 19-year-old woman.
   Earlier Monday, the nation's high court voted 7-2 to refuse the
appeal filed by lawyers for Landry, 39, a native of Lafayette
Parish, La., who was convicted of killing a Houston restaurant owner
during a robbery.
   Since the Supreme Court in 1976 allowed capital punishment to
resume, no state has executed two inmates in a single day, although
two inmates, and in one case three, have been executed on the same
day in separate states.
   Before Tuesday's scheduled executions, 28 inmates, including two
this year, had been put to death by Texas prison officials since
1976. The tally is the highest of any state.
   Before the issuance of a stay, the two were to be executed in the
same death chamber, with Landry scheduled first.
   Hawkins, 45, faced injection for the rape and stabbing death of
Abbe Rogers Hamilton of Borger, who was killed after Hawkins entered
her apparently unlocked home.
   Hawkins' case Monday went to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans after a federal district judge in Lubbock,
Halbert Woodward, reversed a stay he issued Friday. State attorneys
had appealed his action.
   Hawkins also has a second death sentence for the abduction and
slaying of a 12-year-old Amarillo girl. He has been dubbed the
``traveling rapist'' after admitting to some 40 rapes, prosecutors
said.
   Landry's attorney, Michael Charlton, bypassed lower federal
courts and had appealed directly to the high court.
   Landry, a former electrician, was sentenced for the shooting
death of Kosmas Prittis. Prittis, 33, a Greek immigrant, was robbed
of more than $2,300 and fatally shot in the head while he and his
family were closing their restaurant.
   Last January, Landry came within three hours of execution before
the Supreme Court issued a stay.
   In appeals for each inmate, defense attorneys cited a case
pending before the Supreme Court involving Texas death row inmate
Johnny Penry. That case challenges the legality of executing
mentally retarded inmates.
   ``This man isn't retarded,'' assistant attorney general Bob Walt
said of Landry. ``I don't think that's going to fly with the Supreme
Court.''
   Landry, an 11th-grade dropout, has a lengthy criminal record,
including arrests for sexual assault and abuse of a juvenile,
assault, family neglect and petty larceny.

   More than 200 Cubans came to Miami over the weekend
as part of a program to reunite Cuban-Americans with relatives who
left Cuba but have been stranded in other countries.
   About 190 Cubans arrived Saturday and an additional 20 arrived
Sunday on flights from Spain. Some 370 more Cubans were expected to
arrive Tuesday and Thursday on flights sponsored by the Cuban
American National Foundation.
   The refugees were greeted with cheers as they arrived.
   ``I'm elated,'' said Gilfredo Landa, 21, as he hugged his
brothers, Nelson, 19, and Yoeidy, 14. The two brothers had just
arrived to join Gilfredo, who arrived in 1980 during the Mariel
boatlift.
   ``They're going to learn English,'' he said.
   Since the foundation program began Sept. 11, 805 former Cubans
have arrived in the United States from Panama and Costa Rica.
   Under the guidelines of the program, relatives or friends of the
refugees promise to pay travel costs and provide financial support
for two years.
   Foundation chairman Jorge Mas Canosa said there will be more
flights from Spain, Panama, Costa Rica and possibly Peru and
Venezuela. The foundation can bring up to 1,500 refugees into the
country this year.

   A Parliament member says his
constituents are outraged by a government plan to exhume and re-bury
the remains of more than 3,600 people to make way for a new traffic
interchange.
   ``It's wrong, immoral and unchristian,'' said Patrick McKenzie,
who represents the Cape Town suburb of Bontheuwel in the mixed-race
chamber of Parliament.
   Major newspapers on Sunday carried a list of all the dead people
whose graves in Maitland Cemetery will be affected by the
construction project.
   ``Existing memorials will be suitably re-erected, and a Garden of
Remembrance established for the re-burial of the remains of those
who at present do not have any memorials,'' said a notice
accompanying the list.
   McKenzie was quoted by the nationally circulated Sunday Times as
saying those buried in the cemetery were mostly mixed-race people
but also included white immigrants from Germany and elsewhere.

   More than a dozen flights were delayed at Osaka
International Airport when a man broke into a control room and
disconnected hundreds of fuses from the air traffic control system,
police said today.
   The incident cut communications between airport controllers and
flights using the airport for about 40 minutes on Sunday, said a
local police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Six departures and 11 arrivals were delayed for up to half an
hour.
   Police arrested a 26-year-old man they described only as a
professional golfer. The official said the man may have entered the
closely guarded communications control center when employees were at
lunch.
   Police using a duplicate key entered and overpowered the man, who
shouted that he was acting ``at the guidance of Jesus Christ,'' the
official said.
   His identity was withheld pending investigation of his mental
health.

   More than twice the number of minority high
school students took advancement placement exams in 1988 than five
years ago, led by a surge among Hispanics and Asian-Americans, the
College Board reported.
   The board's annual survey of advanced placement tests, which high
school students take to qualify for credit or placement in
upper-level college courses, also found that California, New York
and Florida had by far the most black and Hispanic test-takers who
scored qualifying grades.
   In all, 288,372 students took 419,101 advanced placement exams in
1988. The program, sponsored by the College Board, offers 27
college-level examinations in 16 subjects.
   Nearly 52,000 minority students nationwide took the exams in
1988, compared with 39,517 in 1987, and 142 percent more than the
21,501 who took it five years ago, the College Board said Sunday.
   Forty-nine thousand of those students scored high enough to
qualify for college credit. The tests are scored on a scale of 1-5,
with colleges usually requiring at least a 3 to qualify for credit.
   Minority students made up nearly 20 percent of all advanced
placement test-takers in 1988, compared with 18.4 percent in 1987
and 14.7 percent in 1984.
   ``By using AP to raise the expectations of minority students and
helping them achieve higher goals ... schools are bringing more
minorities into professional and graduate schools,'' said board
president Donald M. Stewart.
   The number of Asian-American students taking the exams was
27,396, up from 21,101 in 1987 and 140 percent greater than the
11,413 in 1984.
   The number of Hispanics taking the test grew 156 percent over
five years: from 5,200 to 13,322; the number of blacks grew by 135
percent, from 4,448 to 10,448.
   The number of whites taking the tests totaled 210,582, up 27
percent from 165,924 in 1987, and 80 percent higher than the 117,302
in 1984.
   Some 8,247 schools offered the exams in 1988, 470 more than last
year.
   Plano High School, near Dallas, with a student body of 2,600, had
the largest number of advanced placement candidates of any school _
490 _ and the largest number of tests taken _ 887, according to the
report.
   California led the nation with 5,125 black and Hispanic
test-takers last year. New York was second with 2,526, followed by
Florida with 2,439.
   The College Board is a nonprofit organization representing 2,600
colleges and other educational groups.

   Culture Minister Jack Lang says he's sometimes
humiliated when he can't find anything to watch on the six French
television channels but programs imported from the United States.
   Lang, in a television interview on Sunday, called on the station
chiefs to make their programming ``more French, more European.''
   ``I am sometimes humiliated by the fact that at certain times
there's nothing to watch but American series,'' he said. ``This is
unacceptable. I say to the channel managers: Do your job, serve
French culture.''
   While Lang was speaking on the state-owned FR3 channel Sunday
afternoon, French viewers had the choice of turning to other
stations to watch such U.S.-made programs as ``Magnum P.I.,'' ``The
Incredible Hulk,'' or ``Max Headroom.''

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha is
campaigning doggedly to improve South Africa's image overseas, but
he faces constant reminders that success will be limited until he
comes to terms with Nelson Mandela.
   Among those conveying that message in recent days were South
Africa's best-known novelist, black and white corporate executives,
and two leading U.S. senators who were rebuffed curtly when they
asked Botha if they could meet the jailed African National Congress
leader.
   Even the government's recent decision to transfer Mandela to a
prison farm staff house, complete with swimming pool and patio,
seemed to underscore the special stature of the 70-year-old black
nationalist.
   ``They are showing that he is the major kingpin in the
constitutional future of South Africa,'' said Dave Dalling,
parliament member from the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal Party.
   Perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the influence wielded over
South Africa by Mandela and his ANC came in court testimony last
week on behalf of 11 black activists about to be sentenced for
treason and terrorism in the same courthouse where Mandela received
a life sentence for sabotage in 1964.
   Most of the 11 treason defendants were affiliated to the United
Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition which the
trial judge said had collaborated with the ANC.
   The defense lawyers, instead of repudiating the ANC, summoned
several of South Africa's most respected opposition figures to speak
about their support for and understanding of the outlawed guerrilla
movement.
   Nadine Gordimer, the country's foremost novelist, said she
considered Mandela her leader and blamed her fellow whites for South
Africa's political violence.
   Sam Motsuenyane, a black bank chairman, said of Mandela:
``Unquestionably, he is my hero.''
   Similar statements came from a university administrator and the
leader of a black homeland. In a subsequent magazine interview, a
prominent Afrikaner business leader, Anton Rupert, said he wanted to
meet Mandela ``man to man'' to discuss a peaceful political
settlement.
   Botha has declined to spell out his plans for Mandela as he
presses ahead with an unprecedented campaign to ease international
pressure on South Africa.
   In the past few weeks, he has commuted the widely denounced death
sentences of a group of blacks known as the Sharpeville Six, freed
two elderly black political prisoners and endorsed a tentative peace
plan that could end South African rule over Namibia.
   All these steps, as well as Mandela's transfer, have been
welcomed in Western capitals. But always, the pressure to deal
politically with Mandela and the ANC resumes.
   Botha also is under fire for continued repression of dissidents
at home while he tries to impress power brokers abroad.
   Even a seemingly benevolent gesture, the recent release of
detained black newspaper editor Zwelakhe Sisulu, had a harsh edge to
it. Sisulu, like several other freed detainees, was prohibited from
returning to his job, restricted to the area around his home and
barred from anti-government political activity.
   U.S. Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and David Boren of Oklahoma, at
the close of a one-week fact-finding trip, acknowledged Saturday
that Botha had taken some positive steps but said they came away
with a feeling of pessimism.
   ``If those who are working for real change are foreclosed from
using non-violent political methods, it is our great fear that they
will be forced to turn to methods that will undoubtedly lead to
violence and tragedy,'' the two Democrats said.
   Botha, said Boren, ``deeply disappointed us by wanting to talk
only about the past, not trying to engage and assess and share ideas
about the future.''
   Even if Mandela were released, opposition leaders say the gesture
would mean little unless he and other prominent black militants,
young and old, are allowed to engage freely in politics and to work
for a one-person, one-vote system.
   Botha says he is not willing to even discuss such a system, and
there is no sign that Mandela's release would mean an easing of
restrictions on opposition activity.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An autistic man who served as a model
for Dustin Hoffman's latest movie character watched the premiere of
``Rain Man'' with the actor three rows behind him.
   Joseph Sullivan, 28, was one of three autistic people Hoffman
studied to prepare for the role of Raymond Babbitt, an idiot savant
who inherits $3 million from his father's estate but has no concept
of money.
   Hoffman, director Barry Levinson and producer Mark Johnson came
to Huntington to help raise funds for the Autism Services Center,
which is run by Sullivan's mother, Ruth.
   About 1,500 people attended Sunday's benefit at the ornate
Keith-Albee Theater. The center said it expected to get $30,000 to
$35,000.
   ``It's not something that's happened to us before, coming to a
town which has a family in it which was the inspiration for our
film,'' Hoffman told the 600 people attending a dinner following the
premiere. ``It's just a very moving experience for myself and my
wife, and Barry and his wife, and Mark and his wife.
   ``We just made a film that's going to play for, you know, a month
or two, or whatever, in cities in America and around the world and
be put out on (video) cassette and put on shelves and seen once.
   ``You people have Joe in your community for the rest of your
lives, and I would take that any day of the week, and I think that's
a really important thing because he is a very special person who
shines through this ... magic he has.''
   Autism is an affliction in which the brain doesn't process
information correctly. Some autistics are self-abusive and lack
social skills but excel in music, math and art.
   Generally, though, autism is misunderstood, said Mrs. Sullivan.
   ``I had people say, `Isn't it nice your little boy knows how to
draw,'' Mrs. Sullivan said.
   Mrs. Sullivan gave the movie credit for advancing knowledge of
autism, telling Hoffman, ``You have done with one film what we have
been trying to do in our field for 25 years.''
   Hoffman said, however, ``If we do one-tenth of what Mrs. Sullivan
has done, we will have made a little advance.''

   A painting by Canaletto has been sold for
1.4 billion lire ($1.01 million), a record amount for a Venetian
artist's work, the Italian news service ANSA reported.
   The work, called ``The Bull Hunt in St. Mark's Piazza,'' was sold
at an auction Sunday in Venice's Giovannelli Palace.
   Canaletto, whose real name was Giovanni Antonio Canal, lived from
1697 to 1768 and won fame for his precisely painted views of Venice,
London and the English countryside.
   The previous record was not disclosed.
   Venice has a long artistic tradition and has produced such
painters as Titian, Paolo Veneziano and Giovanni Bellini.

   Leanne Patton, a 16-year-old
Protestant, had never met a Roman Catholic until she went to a
memorial service for the victims of an IRA bombing and ended up
holding hands with two nuns.
   That moment at St. Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, when the minister
asked everyone in the overflowing congregation to join hands and
pray, marked a turning point in Leanne's life.
   She had been crying for the 11 people killed in Enniskillen on
Nov. 8, 1987 and was so wrapped up in the service she didn't realize
she had picked up the hands of two nuns who were sitting beside her.
   ``I went home and I thought, `I'm just really fed up that I have
to hate this woman because she's wearing a nun's habit, I have to
hate this fellow because he's a Catholic.' It just went over and
over in my mind, you know, what am I going to do?,'' she said.
   ``I'd never met any Catholics, never, never. ... My mom and dad
are very good, they really are. They didn't keep me away from
Catholics. It's just where I lived there weren't any,'' she said.
   In Northern Ireland, with its history of sectarian animosities,
it is common for youngsters, and even adults, never to have met
someone of another religion.
   Many of Northern Ireland's 1 million Protestants and 600,000
Catholics live in neighborhoods segregated along religious lines,
and all but 1,000 of the province's 350,000 children attend schools
that are almost entirely Protestant or Catholic.
   Leanne is studying for college entrance exams at mainly
Protestant Grosvenor High School in east Belfast.
   After the Enniskillen memorial service, she decided to try to
arrange an exchange with a Catholic high school.
   ``I never thought it would be anything big, just a small
meeting,'' Leanne said. ``I was a very quiet person ... but
something inside of me said, `I think you should really advertise
this,' and before I knew what I was saying, I asked ... if I could
(address) the school assembly.
   ``Well, I went and did that assembly, and they clapped and they
clapped and I was just shocked. I didn't think anybody felt the same
way I did. And there were hundreds of them. ... They said this is
the right thing we're doing.''
   The first exchange late last year was with a group of Catholic
students from two schools, Our Lady of Mercy and St. Patrick's.
   As the Grosvenor students waited for the Catholics to arrive,
Leanne said, ``they were literally trying to think what these
Catholics were going to look like. Are they going to talk funny and
what are their names going to be like?
   ``Because we'd never met, we just had these ideas about the other
side, and then when we came together, we just realized they were
just like us.''
   Over the past year, the students have exchanged further visits.
Friendships have grown outside school, with frequent visits to local
discos, restaurants and the movies, and shared stays at a
government-sponsored camp.
   The Grosvenor girls have also participated in a play, ``Bridges
of Celebration,'' with boys from Corpus Christi College, a Catholic
secondary school in west Belfast, an Irish Republican Army
stronghold. It filled the Opera House in Belfast and will be
performed again in Dublin in February.
   Recalling the first rehearsal, on neutral ground at Queen's
University in Belfast, Leanne said:
   ``When they first walked in ... they just sat down and stared at
you. I said, `Oh dear, what's this going to be like?' But then we
got to know them and we realized they were great.''
   She has no illusions that her activities will change the country.
``No way. I'm never going to become a Catholic and none of them are
ever going to become a Protestant just because they've met,'' she
said.
   ``But just the fact that we are meeting and becoming friends ...
it is harder to hate someone if you know them.''

<HEAD>West Germans Becoming Impatient with Foreign Military Presence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West Germans are showing sharp
impatience with foreign NATO troops on their soil as their
perception grows of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Soviet Union as a nation
of peace.
   The top U.S. military commander in Europe calls it ``wishful
thinking.''
   On Nov. 22, a British armored unit scrapped plans to enter a
northern town during maneuvers because the townspeople were fed up
with the noise and property damage created by war games.
   Three months earlier, a court blocked U.S. Army plans to station
36 helicopters outside Wiesbaden. The ruling came amid intense local
opposition to the noise caused by American aircraft and forces
already in the area.
   American troops and other forces of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization have been guarding this frontline nation since the end
of World War II.
   In maneuvers designed to keep the alliance's forces at peak
readiness, NATO tanks rumble across West German farms and as jet
aircraft swoop in on low passes.
   But West German politicians say they are facing what has become a
widespread public perception that Gorbachev, the Soviet president,
is a messenger of peace, and an accompanying attitude that perhaps
the hair-trigger military readiness and the resulting inconveniences
can finally be lessened.
   Gorbachev announced Wednesday before the United Nations that he
will reduce Soviet forces by 500,000 troops, including removing
50,000 soldiers and six tank divisions from Eastern Europe by 1991.
   West German unease about foreign troops within its borders has
increased this year amid a rash of NATO jet crashes. On Thursday a
U.S. fighter jet slammed into Remscheid, killing the pilot and five
people on the ground. Seventy people were killed in a fiery air show
disaster Aug. 28 at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein, when
Italian stunt planes collided.
   ``There is a deep-seated longing for peace. People find the idea
of lowering the military posture very attractive,'' Peter Petersen,
a federal lawmaker in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, told The Associated Press.
   Petersen says West Germany is a committed NATO partner and that
Kohl's government sees the foreign troops in his country as still
necessary for the security of Western Europe.
   But Petersen adds that domestic political pressure for a serious
reduction in low-level NATO jet flights, fewer maneuvers that damage
property, and other demands cannot be ignored.
   Karsten Voigt, a lawmaker with the left-leaning opposition Social
Democrats, agreed.
   ``It is increasingly difficult for politicians of all political
colors to defend defensive needs against regional and national
pressures,'' Voigt said at the Nov. 13-18 Hamburg congress of the
North Atlantic Assembly, an independent body of lawmakers from the
16 NATO nations.
   The Social Democrats have taken a harder stance than the
Christian Democrats, maintaining that NATO's overall defense
strategy is outdated and needs to be reworked.
   U.S. military officials and conservative American politicians in
recent months have been aggressively trying to counteract West
European perceptions of Gorbachev as a peacemaker.
   ``We must not get a distorted idea of what is really happening,''
Gen. John Galvin, supreme Allied commander in Europe, recently told
reporters. ``Wishful thinking is causing the West to get deeper into
a situation in which support for deterrence may be seriously
threatened.''
   A new West German unease about foreign troops on their soil has
become especially apparent during the debate in NATO over
``burden-sharing.''
   U.S. officials charge that Western Europe is not shouldering its
fair share of NATO's financial burden and are asking West Germany
and other countries to spend more for defense.
   The accusation is a sensitive one in West Germany, where about
400,000 foreign NATO troops, including 250,000 Americans, are based.
   Kohl himself has suggested that his countrymen already endure
enough inconvenience because of NATO troops on their soil.
   Kohl and other West German officials suggest the United States
should not be looking just at dollars and cents when weighing each
NATO nation's contribution to the alliance.
   The West Germans say other factors should be assessed as well,
such as foreign tanks tearing up farmland and fears among the
population caused by low-level flights by military jets.
   ``There are 5,000 military exercises in this densely populated
country each year,'' said Petersen, the Christian Democrat lawmaker.
   ``There's no piece of real estate where you have a greater
concentration of soldiers and weapons _ including nuclear weapons.
   ``The Americans should understand these burdens. We want them to
stay here, but they must realize this is a political burden.''
   Thomas Enders, a political scientist at the German Society for
Foreign Politics, said a recent survey indicated that about 80
percent of West Germans backs NATO, but he added that a ``resurgence
of neutralism'' within West Germany could grow with Gorbachev in
power in the Soviet Union.
   An poll this past summer indicated that 71 percent of West
Germans had a favorable opinion of Gorbachev, compared with only 41
percent for President Reagan.
   But Kohl's government assures its transatlantic allies that it is
not convinced the threat from the East has vanished, and that West
Germany is committed to keeping NATO strong.
   Said Petersen: ``We're right next door to East Germany, so we
know full well why that is important.''

   A new kind of state prison _ for pregnant inmates
only _ opens today in an effort to keep new mothers and their babies
together.
   Although a few other prison systems in the country make efforts
to allow mothers to remain for a time with their infants, the Neil
J. Houston House in Boston's Roxbury section will offer features
unavailable elsewhere.
   Separating women and babies at birth causes ``a serious rupture
in mother-infant bonding,'' said Lyla Austin, co-director of Social
Justice for Women, a private, non-profit advocacy group for women
prison inmates.
   The group will run the $550,000 program under a contract with the
state Department of Correction.
   ``It's a historic step for the state and the country, to show
respect for the mother and infant bond,'' Ms. Austin said last week.
   Currently, inmates in Massachusetts are separated from their
children and returned to their cells within days of giving birth.
   Inmates of the 15-bed facility will be confined to the building
but have access to counselors, drug rehabilitation, help in
readjusting to society and medical care during pregnancy and after.
   The first resident, expected to be admitted in January, will find
an atmosphere more like a halfway house than a jail. Guards will
wear civilian clothes.
   Only women eligible for early release will be considered for
admission, and it is expected that they will complete their
sentences at the house.
   ``Three years ago, Social Justice for Women decided some
immediate action was needed,'' Ms. Austin said. ``We had been
working with women at (the state prison at) Framingham. We saw the
numbers of pregnant women growing.''
   About 50 pregnant women go through the state prison system every
year; there were 17 prison births in 1986, the last year for which
figures were available.
   The average sentence for women convicted in this state is four
months, usually for drug-related crimes and prostitution, correction
officials said.
   Since 1980 the number of women imprisoned in Massachusetts has
risen 239 percent, an increase Ms. Austin attributed to the general
trend nationwide toward incarcerating people and away from sexism.
   Early in this century women routinely kept their babies with them
in prison until people began to worry about the stigma attached to
anyone who claimed a prison as their birthplace.
   More recently, New York started allowing babies born in prison to
stay with their mothers until their first birthday, said Kenneth
Perlman, deputy superintendent for services at the New York State
prison at Bedford Hills.
   ``The bonding that results is very positive, both for mother and
child, the way the babies develop and mature,'' Perlman said in a
telephone interview.
   In Georgia, qualified pregnant inmates receive a 60-day furlough
30 days before they are due to give birth so that delivery can occur
outside prison.
   But most women imprisoned in Georgia, like those in other states,
must return to their cells 40 to 72 hours after giving birth.
   Prison officials around the country said they knew of no such
community-based program and said the Massachusetts program sounded
like a good idea.
   ``I see when the women come in here that one of the hardest
things is being separated from their children,'' said Maureen
Atwood, associate warden of prisons at the federal minimum-security
prison for women in Alderson, W.Va.

<HEAD>Bowen: Bush Has Hands Full with Medicare Spending Spiral</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will have its hands
full trying to cap Medicare's spending spiral without cutting into
the quality of health care the program provides to 32 million
Americans, says outgoing Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R.
Bowen.
   ``One the reasons it's going to be tougher is because of the
massive new numbers of old people that we have coming along,'' Bowen
said.
   With overall Medicare costs growing at about twice the rate of
inflation, Bowen said the $100 billion program is a natural place to
look for savings.
   ``At the same time we have to walk a very tight line and make
sure we are not reducing the quality of care and access to care,''
he said in an interview. ``It is my judgment that we're getting
close to that level now and we have to be very cautious about going
too deep.''
   Bowen declined to discuss specifics of the final budget the
Reagan administration will submit next month, but department sources
have acknowledged agreeing to about $6 billion in net reductions in
projected Medicare outlays, mostly by holding down payments to
doctors and hospitals.
   The physician portion of Medicare _ Part B _ is growing about 15
percent a year and Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress have
said it will undergo close scrutiny in budget deliberations.
   Beyond the cuts he has agreed to for the next budget, Bowen said,
``We are getting close to the time where further ratcheting down
could cause some deterioration in the quality of care and perhaps
even access to care.''
   Bowen, who will be 71 in February and plans to retire in Indiana,
noted that projections call for the number of people over the age of
100 to increase from 25,000 to 100,000 over the next decade.
   Not only will they tend to require more medical attention, but
many also will used up savings and ``might become a bigger burden''
on public assistance, he said.
   Bowen, a former two-term governor of Indiana who said running
that state was easier than running the huge HHS department, said his
greatest accomplishment was getting President Reagan to back a
catastrophic-illness insurance addition to Medicare in the most
sweeping expansion of the program since its birth two decades ago.
   ``Getting the president's approval over the objections of so many
in the Cabinet, that was the tough part,'' said Bowen. ``Once the
president gave his approval, then it became a lot easier to try to
contain the number of additions Congress wanted to add to it.''
   On the other hand, Bowen said he is disappointed he has been
unable to get states to move more quickly to solve medical
malpractice insurance problems which he said are threatening access
to health care in some regions.
   He said the Bush administration should be ready to introduce
federal legislation to override the states on the issue unless they
move quickly. Bowen said he was not suggesting such a step during
the coming year, ``but certainly within four years'' unless the
states act.
   Bowen said there is a remaining need for special emphasis on AIDS
``because of the emotional response of the people. People are scared
to death.''
   ``I hesitate to single it out as a disease to be treated
differently from others, but I think as yet it does need to have a
little extra special treatment,'' he said.
   Bowen said he has not been consulted by Bush transition officials
for a recommendation on who should succeed him. But he said he hopes
the incoming president will not view the appointment as minor.
   ``When you're talking about a kinder and gentler America, you're
talking about HHS,'' he said of the huge agency that has a larger
budget than the Pentagon and embraces such programs as Social
Security, Medicare and welfare.
   The department also includes the sprawling Public Health Service
umbrella that covers such well-known agencies as the Food and Drug
Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers
for Disease Control.
   Bowen said he hopes Bush will give the new HHS secretary
authority to pick the heads of those major agencies.
   ``I think loyalty is one of the most important attributes of
somebody who is working for you and the appointing authority sort of
draws that loyalty,'' he said. ``I think you can get a lot more
accomplished and better serve the public if you have a team rather
than somebody who you never knew and never worked with. Maybe you
wouldn't develop the confidence in them you should.''

<HEAD>Nearly 10 Million Lost Jobs Due to Plant Closings, Layoffs Last
Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs due
to plant closings or layoffs from 1983 to 1988 despite the longest
peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history, the government
reports.
   Of 9.7 million displaced workers during the period, 4.7 million
were so-called ``tenured'' workers who had held their jobs for three
years or more, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says in the latest of
its biennial reports on worker displacement.
   That was a slight decline from earlier BLS studies of overlapping
five-year periods _ 1979-84 and 1981-86 _ which both had shown that
5.1 million tenured workers lost their jobs during the respective
periods. But each of those periods also included the severe
recession of 1981-82.
   As a result, government and private economists say the new
figures show a persisting displacement problem.
   Larry Mishel, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute, a
liberal Washington think tank, called the decline in job
displacement after the recession years ``surprisingly small.''
   The BLS began conducting the displacement surveys in 1984 at the
request of the Labor Department's Employment and Training
Administration. The latest report was released over the weekend.
   While the 1984 and 1986 surveys showed 50 percent of the
displaced workers coming out of factories, only 40 percent of the
tenured workers losing their jobs in 1983-88 had been employed in
manufacturing.
   In conjunction, the distribution of the layoffs has shifted
somewhat from blue-collar occupations such as machine operators,
laborers and repairmen during the recession periods to white-collar
management and sales occupations from 1983 to 1988.
   ``This was the lean-and-mean era, when companies went after
middle-level managers and other white-collar workers,'' said Mishel.
``But a lot of it, especially in retail trade, is also somewhat
related to these leveraged buyouts. It's probably the better-paid
retail workers who lost their jobs.''
   One thing that hasn't changed is the percentage of workers who
were given some kind of advance notice before losing their jobs. In
all three surveys, roughly six of every 10 displaced workers had
been told in advance to ``expect a layoff.''
   But only two of every 10 in the latest survey said they had
received a written notice of their impending dismissals _ a trend
bound to change in view of a new law requiring 60 days written
notice of plant closings and large layoffs beginning in 1989.
   Of the 4.7 million tenured workers who lost their jobs from 1983
to the end of 1987, 71 percent or approximately 3.2 million of them
had new jobs as of January last year and 14 percent of them said
they were looking for work.
   That compares favorably with re-employment rates of 67 percent
and 60 percent and unemployment rates of 18 percent and 25 percent
in the respective 1986 and 1984 surveys.
   Of those re-employed full-time, 56 percent reported making as
much or more money in their new jobs while 44 percent reported
making less _ in current dollars unadjusted for inflation.
   About 28 percent reported that their earnings had increased by 20
percent or more in their new jobs. Taking inflation into account,
analysts said, that represents the workers who definitely are better
off in their new jobs than they were in their old ones.
   But a slightly larger group, 30 percent, reported suffering an
income loss of at least 20 percent from their old jobs.
   ``That's much deeper than in the previous surveys,'' said Mishel.
``It confirms a continuing trend of high-paid workers having no
alternative but to shift to the poorer-paying jobs being created by
this recovery.''

<TEXT>
   Setting up the George Bush administration _ the
task of some 300 people who toil in offices above a drugstore _ is
being underwritten by the taxpayers to the tune of about $3.5
million.
   Bush's paid transition staff has grown to 149 at last count, with
about the same number of volunteers, officials say.
   The highest paid are top advisers James Baker III and Fred Zeder,
both of whom are being paid at an annual rate of $71,377. After the
transition, Baker will become secretary of state.
   To meet the payroll as well as pay for copying, research,
telephones, rent, supplies and the like, Bush receives a total of
$3.5 million in public money.
   The money is allocated under the Presidential Transition Act of
1964. The amount was increased this year from the $2 million that
was allowed when President Reagan took office eight years ago.
   The Bush operation, housed in three floors of an office building
across the street from the hotel where Reagan was shot and wounded
in 1981, is far more spare than the mini-bureaucracy of more than
1,000 people who worked for Reagan's transition in 1980.
   And unlike Reagan, Bush is not supplementing his transition
allowance with private donations.
   ``We just wanted to work within the money appropriated by the
Congress and not make this become a big, fat, bloated operation,''
said transition spokesman David Prosperi. ``This is not going to be
a fast-growing bureaucracy. At this point close to $800,000 has not
been allocated by us to our budget, which does indicate that we
could return a sizeable chunk of money to the federal Treasury.''
   Volunteers are being used in clerical positions and the work days
for transition officials stretch into late-night hours that have
provoked some grumbling about the need for more staff.
   Ray Fontaine, comptroller of the General Services Administration,
which is responsible for overseeing transition spending, called it a
``very lean'' operation.
   Bush's transition staff can be smaller because, as a member of
the same party and administration already in power, he will not be
making the sweeping changes that Reagan made when he took over from
Democratic President Jimmy Carter.
   ``This is what we call a friendly takeover,'' said Prosperi.
   The amount Reagan finally spent on his transition was never
known, because he was not required to disclose the amount of private
contributions his team collected, said GSA public affairs specialist
Steve Guiheen.
   Reagan ended up not actually spending all the public money, and
returned some $250,000 of the $2 million to the Treasury, according
to GSA records.
   Congress this year enacted a disclosure requirement for any
private money raised by the transition operations.
   Prosperi said that just over a third of the transition budget is
going into payroll.
   Salary schedules for the transition workers are set according to
Civil Service scales, with the average salary at $35,137, according
to Bush transition officials.
   A status report to the GSA, detailing expenditures through the
end of November, showed Bush had run up bills of more than $1
million in payroll and benefits for employees, many of whom went
onto the transition payroll straight from the Bush campaign.
   Rent and utilities came to almost $100,000, while printing and
reproduction had cost $27,000.
   The transition had bills of $11,000 for supplies and had spent
almost $149,000 on ``other services.''

<TEXT>
   The first dance in this 100-year-old Ozark
town's high school is just a memory, but the students who thought it
was ``a blast'' may not get an encore.
   The school board is appealing a court ruling that its policy
against school dances is unconstitional. A federal appeals court
allowed Saturday night's dance while the matter is considered.
   Officials restricted the dance to Purdy High School's 161
students, saying they wanted to avoid any chance of trouble. Among
those barred were reporters and photographers, and even an alumnus
who was the lead plaintiff in the federal lawsuit that brought
dancing to Purdy High.
   Jonathan Clayton, a 1987 graduate, got only as close as the
basketball game that preceded the homecoming dance.
   ``It's OK, though _ I won,'' Clayton said as he watched the game
and greeted old friends. ``It's still worth it. The idea was to
allow Purdy students to have a dance, and we did that.''
   Clayton, a business school student, and 20 other Purdy students
and parents sued in 1986 to overturn the school board's written
policy banning dancing.
   Longtime residents in this town of 900 say Purdy has never been
without a ban on social dancing in the schools. Some have said they
associate dancing with drinking, drugs and illicit sex.
   But U.S. District Judge Russell Clark ruled this summer that the
school board's ban promoted the values of those who oppose dancing
for religious reasons.
   The board appealed Clark's order that they stop enforcing the
ban, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is not expected to
rule in the case before next year.
   The dance ban evoked comparisons to the hit movie ``Footloose''
about a similar ban in a fictional town.
   Although barred from dancing at school, Purdy students have held
dances at the community center or in neighboring towns. But they
said that was inconvenient and unfair.
   Sheldon Buxton, superintendent of the Purdy school system, said
about 85 students attended Saturday night's dance. He said it went
smoothly, but he refused to comment on whether other dances could be
expected.
   Student council president Nancy Fox said board members attended
the dance. But the board members, who sat on the sidelines during
the dance talking among themselves, apparently did not cramp
students' style.
   ``It was a blast, we had a great time,'' Miss Fox said.
   ``It was really fun, everybody's dancing,'' said Shannon
Francisco, a senior who left the dance early.
   But Miss Francisco, 17, added that the dance had caused
controversy and bitterness in the southwestern Missouri town.
   ``I don't think it was worth all that,'' she said.
   Miss Fox, appearing tired but happy after a day that included a
college entrance exam and the history-making dance, said early
Sunday that she wasn't ready to plan another dance.
   ``I'm still thinking about cleanup for this one,'' she said.

<HEAD>Eggnog Sales Bring Cheer to Dairy Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The traditional eggnog season is in full swing
and every cup that's raised should bring cheer to America's dairy
farmers, says an Agriculture Department economist.
   Most U.S. dairy production is consumed as Grade A milk, cheese,
butter and non-fat dry milk. But dairy economist Jim Miller of the
USDA's Economic Research Service says several frequently overlooked
products ``lie in the shadows'' of the big-volume items.
   These include eggnog, fluid cream, yogurt, cottage cheese and
canned milk, Miller said. Collectively, they use the equivalent of
about 11 billion pounds of milk each year and have a farm value of
about $1 billion.
   Miller, in a report and a telephone interview, said U.S.
commercial use of milk in 1987 was a record of about 136 billion
pounds and that this year's consumption probably will edge still
higher.
   Although Miller said he had no breakdown showing how much eggnog
counted in the group of lesser items, sales figures indicate that
eggnog has grown in popularity, more than doubling between 1970 and
1987.
   ``Some growth in eggnog sales has come from use outside the
holiday season,'' Miller said.
   At one time, milk processors started selling eggnog just before
Thanksgiving and quit in late December. Today, he said, some eggnog
processors begin selling for Halloween and continue through the
holidays. Sales are sometimes resumed for a brief Easter season.
   But it will take more than merriment around the holiday eggnog
bowl to keep pace with American dairy farmers.
   Miller told the USDA's recent outlook conference that milk
production this year is expected to rise 2 percent to another record
level of around 145 billion pounds. Production declined slightly in
1987 to 142.5 billion pounds from the record in 1986 of 143.5
billion pounds.
   ``The new record was reached because of an increase of almost 3
percent in milk per cow,'' he said. The number of cows in production
this year was estimated at 10.2 million, down 1 percent from 1987
and the fewest on record.
   Miller said there are a lot of variables ahead for 1989,
including feed costs and other factors. Even so, total milk output
next year ``may be about the same'' as in 1988, while commercial use
may be up 1 percent to 3 percent.
   Another factor in the dairy business has been the increase in use
of fluid cream, with sales rising by three-fourths between 1970 and
1987, he said. Whipping cream more than doubled, while half-and-half
and light cream showed similar gains.
   Miller added that ``yogurt has received a great deal of
attention'' because of its popularity among weight watchers and
other consumers. Last year, he said, yogurt sales were up sixfold
from 1970, but he added that the U.S. yogurt market was tiny before
the introduction of sweetened, fruit-flavored brands.
   ``Lost in the excitement about yogurt's rapid growth is the
realization that yogurt remains a minor use of milk,'' Miller said.
``Growth in yogurt sales since 1970 has contributed considerably
less to farm milk demand than have increases in fluid cream use.''

   Britain and Northern Ireland rank well behind
Japan and some of the other giant importers of U.S. agricultural
products, but the Agriculture Department says they show good
potential for growth.
   The market includes 57 million inhabitants, about 77 percent of
whom live in urban areas on a total land mass of 150,000 square
miles, or about the size of Oregon. Collectively Britain and
Northern Ireland make up the United Kingdom.
   Admission to the European Economic Community in 1973 gave the
U.K. increased exposure to ``Euro-continental'' food brands, the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service said in a recent trade
report.
   ``Nonetheless, Britain possesses a strong food production
capability as well as a taste for traditional food items, although
the latter is changing along with consumer lifestyles,'' the report
said. ``Seafood, meat, dairy and grain products produced or
processed in the United Kingdom remain popular while North American
and Asian food items perform well within certain market segments.''
   The report noted a number of economic characteristics that make
the United Kingdom attractive to exporting countries. Between 1983
and 1986, for example, per capita disposable income grew by 19.5
percent. Total national spending on food rose by 12 percent during
the same period.
   ``Growth in food-related spending appears consistent with the
general direction of the U.K. economy,'' the report said.
   Last year, it said, agricultural imports totaled $18.5 billion,
with the U.S. market share at 6 percent, or about $1.1 billion.
Meanwhile, U.S. imports of agricultural products from the United
Kingdom were valued at $367 million last year.

   Wayne Boutwell, president of the National
Council of Farmer Cooperatives, has been named leader of a U.S.
agricultural trade and development mission to two African countries
next year.
   The Agriculture Department mission, which will include at least
half a dozen other members, will visit Kenya and the Ivory Coast,
probably in February, although officials said the exact dates have
to be negotiated.
   Similar missions were carried out this year to the Philippines,
Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Mexico as part of a program to
boost farm trade with designated countries.

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle is likely to
push for more conservative arms-control stances during backstage
negotiations, but he no doubt will toe the administration line in
public, national security analysts say.
   ``Quayle's certainly been more conservative than Bush, but this
is going to be a Bush administration, not a Quayle administration,''
said James Hackett, a national security analyst with the non-profit,
conservative Heritage Foundation.
   John Isaacs, director of the liberal Council for a Livable World,
agreed. ``I think that to the extent there's any disagreement
between the two, it will be Quayle making the accommodation, not
Bush,'' he said.
   Quayle, a Republican from Indiana, was one of the Senate's most
conservative members on national security issues during his eight
years in the chamber.
   For example, Quayle voiced a series of questions and criticisms
earlier this year about the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty
negotiated by President Reagan. Vice President George Bush strongly
supported the pact, which was ratified by the Senate.
   Quayle, who eventually voted for the pact, said in a 1987
interview that ``I have a lot of questions (about the INF treaty),
and I don't believe in the long run, quite frankly, contrary to the
popular perception, that this is going to be a big political plus
for this administration.''
   Quayle also has voiced skepticism about Reagan administration
efforts to negotiate a U.S.-Soviet Strategic Arms Reduction Talk
treaty providing deep reductions in the long-range arsenals of each
nation. Bush has supported those efforts and pledged to work toward
a START pact after he replaces Reagan on Jan. 20.
   In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last Feb. 3 on the
INF pact, Quayle said, ``If in fact we do not get a START agreement,
it is not going to be the end of the world. As a matter of fact, it
might give us some time to see how the INF agreement is going to be
implemented.''
   Bush, in his first debate with Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis, said, ``We've achieved an arms control agreement
(INF) that our critics thought was never possible. And I want to
build on it _ I want to see us finalize the START agreement.''
   Both Quayle and Bush have said the United States should be
negotiating to reduce conventional weapons in Europe, where the
Soviets have a large numerical advantage.
   John Steinbrunner, director of foreign policy studies for the
liberal Brookings Institution, said Quayle's influence is likely to
be limited when the Bush administration begins drafting arms control
positions.
   ``Quayle has been a classic hardliner on arms control, but I
don't think many people imagine that he's going to have a very great
weight in deliberations,'' Steinbrunner said. ``The speculation
really focuses on how Bush's own plans evolve.''
   ``Quayle and other members of the right wing would have slowed up
or strung out the INF treaty if they had the votes, but they showed
they didn't have the votes,'' Steinbrunner said. ``The right wing
has limited appeal. It's very vociferous, it's very intense, but in
fact it's not in line with most people in the United States.''
   Raymond Garthoff, who helped negotiate the SALT I and
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaties, agreed that Quayle is likely to
have only limited influence.
   ``Quayle won't differ publicly, but he may be a voice for the
conservatives within the inner councils of the administration. I
don't expect that he'll have a large influence, but his opinion may
be sought by Bush to understand what the conservatives are
thinking,'' Garthoff said.
   Hackett concurred that Quayle is likely to seek to influence
administration positions. ``Certainly Quayle will support the
administration in public, despite what it does, but I presume he
will have some influence in the in-house meetings that lead up to
the public positions,'' he said.

<HEAD>Base-Closing Panel Will Meet Year-End Deadline, Chairman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A presidential commission studying the nation's
more than 3,800 military installations is closing in on its goal of
determining which ones should be shut down.
   Former Rep. Jack Edwards, the Alabama Republican who is
co-chairman of the 12-member panel, says it will meet its year-end
deadline of recommending which bases should be closed.
   But Edwards said a final list has yet to be prepared by the
commission, which will report to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   ``People keep asking about a list and wanting to know how many
bases, but we don't have a goal in terms of numbers,'' he said. ``We
haven't made any final decisions yet.''
   The commission is an attempt to untie a congressional knot that
has blocked the Pentagon from closing any bases since 1977.
Legislators, loathe to lose the jobs that bases provide, have
erected a long and complicated series of barriers to individual
closings.
   ``Closing bases is tough for any congressman,'' said Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
``You're talking lost jobs and that means unhappy voters. This is
near and dear to all our hearts.''
   Edwards said he doesn't know how many bases will be on the final
list, but Aspin predicted ``the figure will likely be 20 to 25
bases, perhaps a few more.''
   Aspin, who said he has purposefully remained aloof from the
panel's work, estimated that annual savings will be about $2 billion.
   Besides evaluating data from the Pentagon, the commission is also
listening to petitions from congressmen and their constituents.
   Last week, Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., delivered more than
13,000 letters from Enid, Okla., urging the panel not to close Vance
Air Force Base.
   Earlier, legislators from northeastern states ranging from Maine
to New Jersey and Pennsylvania had written the panel, urging that
Sunbelt states suffer the most reductions because they said those
states had the most bases.
   After the Edwards' panel finishes its work, Carlucci will have
until Jan. 15 _ five days before he leaves office _ to accept or
reject the entire list. He can't make any other changes.
   If Carlucci approves the list as expected, Congress could only
block the closures if the House and Senate each pass a disapproval
resolution. That resolution could be vetoed by George Bush, meaning
it would effectively take a two-thirds vote in each chamber to block
the shutdowns.
   Edwards explained that his panel is using a complicated set of
criteria to make its decisions.
   First, installations are being grouped by military mission; for
example, all Army depots, all Air Force fighter bases, all Navy
ports for surface ships.
   Then bases in a particular category will be evaluated for five
factors _ mission suitability, including geographical location and
ease of deployment; physical facilities in place; the quality of
those facilities; quality of life for personnel, such as housing;
and community support.
   Bases at the bottom of each ``mission'' list will be considered
for closure, partly by determining if other, higher-ranking bases
can become ``receiving'' facilities.
   Next, cost evaluations will be done, environmental factors such
as hazardous waste problems will be considered, and the impact of
the lost jobs will be weighed.
   ``It's an extremely complicated process,'' said Edwards. ``We
have a huge amount of information to evaluate and judgments to
make.''
   The Pentagon and the services haven't offered any lists. ``What
we have done is asked the services for information, a tremendous
amount of information,'' he said.
   ``We're checking that information by sending staff members and
commission members out to the bases in some instances, talking to
base commanders and local people.''
   Edwards insists politics isn't an issue. ``This the most
non-partisan committee I've ever been associated with. Believe me,
that's the truth.''
   ``We don't look at our charge as having anything to do with
politics. We haven't looked at whose district a base is located
in,'' he said. ``Obviously, everybody else in Washington approaches
it from the perspective of politics, but we haven't.''

<HEAD>Teachers Frustrated By Lack of Support from Parents, Social
Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half of the nation's teachers say
they see evidence of child abuse, poor nutrition and parental
neglect in their classrooms, according to a national study.
   ``Teachers repeatedly made the point that in the push for better
schools they cannot do the job alone, and yet there is a growing
trend to expect schools to do what families, communities and
churches have been unable to accomplish,'' said Ernest L. Boyer,
president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   The foundation's survey of 22,000 teachers found a sense of
frustration among teachers, both at ``the lack of support they
receive from parents'' and from a feeling of ``powerlessness in
teaching,'' he said.
   ``Large majorities of teachers find poverty, poor health,
undernourishment and neglect to be problems at their schools,'' he
said.
   Teachers from every state were canvassed in twin surveys
conducted by mail in the spring and fall of 1987. The findings were
released Sunday.
   Among them:
   _90 percent said lack of parental support was a problem at their
schools.
   _89 percent said there were abused or neglected children at their
schools.
   _69 percent said poor health was a problem for their students.
   _68 percent said some children were undernourished.
   Teachers in the survey described their students ``as `emotionally
needy' and `starved for attention and affection,''' Boyer said.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, said the report underscores the need for parental
involvement.
   ``I wish I could sit down with every parent in America and
emphasize how important they are to their children's education,''
Ms. Futrell said. ``Parents are a child's first _ and potentially
the most influential _ teachers.''
   The average public school teacher earned $28,031 in 1987-88,
according to figures from the NEA.
   Forty-nine percent of the teachers in the Carnegie survey said
their pay was worse than they expected; 41 percent said it was about
what they expected, and 10 percent said it was better. The average
teacher surveyed had 16 years experience.
   The average teacher faced 79 students on a typical day, with
elementary teachers working with 60 different pupils and secondary
teachers 114.
   The typical class size was 23. Sixty-two percent of the teachers
said their most typical class was about the right size; 36 percent
felt it was too large, and 1 percent said it was too small (The
figures do not add up to 100 percent because of rounding).
   Only 7 percent of the teachers surveyed said they planned to quit
the profession as soon as they could. Fifty-six percent planned to
teach until they retire; 21 percent said they probably would
continue teaching; 10 percent were undecided about their career
plans, and 6 percent said they may take time off from teaching.
   The Carnegie Foundation, based in Princeton, N.J., published
earlier ``Condition of Teaching'' reports in 1983 and 1985. It said
the overall margin of error on the unusually large survey was only
plus or minus 1 percentage point.

   A chemical spill forced about 1,500
residents to flee their homes for three hours, authorities said.
   A 55-gallon drum of the insecticide mercapto spilled at PIE
Trucking company late Saturday, San Bernardino County fire
dispatcher Jo Emery said.
   Authorities could not say how the spill occurred.
   Residents of a section of this city 50 miles east of Los Angeles
were evacuated as a precaution for about three hours, Ms. Emery said.
   Several people who complained of throat irritation and burning
around the mouth were treated at the scene, said Fire Capt. Don
Easton.
   Mercapto can be deadly if ingested or harmful if it comes into
direct skin contact, he said.

   Foreigners caught in a clash between Chinese
police and nationalists in Tibet's capital told of diving behind
vendors' tables and running down narrow alleys as troops open fire
without warning.
   ``People were falling and screaming. I saw people carrying
wounded Tibetans on their backs, running into their houses and
trying to find some place to hide,'' said Ron Schwartz, a sociology
professor at the University of Newfoundland in St. Johns, Canada.
   He said he dashed up a street to dodge police bullets and tear
gas. ``It seemed like an eternity I was running up that street,'' he
said in a telephone interview Sunday with The Associated Press.
   The clash broke out Saturday in Lhasa when 30 Tibetans,
identified by the official Xinhua News Agency as Buddhist monks and
nuns, marched into a market with the banned Tibetan flag to
commemorate the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration on Human
Rights. The protesters, dressed in street clothes and face masks,
demanded an end to 38 years of Chinese communist rule over the
Himalayan Mountain region.
   China said Sunday that a Buddhist monk was killed and 13 people
were wounded when police fired at demonstrators. Schwartz said the
monk had been carrying Tibet's banned flag.
   Police ``appeared, marching in a tight formation. They fanned out
in an arc, some very close to the monks,'' said Schwartz. He and the
other foreign witnesses said the police then opened fire without
warning.
   The nationally televised evening news said police ``were forced
to fire'' when ``some troublemakers refused to heed a warning and
threw stones and bottles at police.''
   ``The soldiers were running after us. They came so close,'' said
Christa Meindersma of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, who was shot in
the left arm.
   ``They started shooting, and we started running. I ran for my
life,'' said another witness, an English woman who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   One traveler, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a Tibetan
who went to a hospital to give blood for the wounded saw four bodies.
   The foreigners, who spoke by telephone from their hotels, said
authorities imposed tight security in Lhasa and searched foreigners'
hotel rooms on Sunday.
   Ms. Meindersma said after she was wounded, she tried to hide
``but they came after me so I ran again.''
   ``There was no looking back, it was just running, running. I
heard the bullets skimming past my head: shoo, shoo. My only thought
was, `I have to hide.' I ran into a Tibetan courtyard. There were
many people there in panic. I said, `I'm wounded,' and I fainted.''
   A British man who spoke on condition of anonymity said he ran in
a different direction and found himself in a narrow alley with about
50 Tibetans.
   ``The police fired tear gas at both ends of the alley,'' he said.
``I thought I was going to die of suffocation.'' After 10 minutes,
he said the gas subsided, and the group escaped.
   ``Some Tibetans took me to a small temple where I saw the dead
body of the monk who had been shot in the head,'' he said. ``There
was a crowd of Tibetans weeping.''
   At the scene of the shooting, he said, a tear-gas canister lay
near a pool of blood. ``Within half an hour after the demonstration,
Tibetans began laying white scarves near the pool of blood and the
canister,'' he said.
   Tibetan Buddhists drape gauzy, white scarves over the statues of
deities in their temples as a gesture of greeting and respect.
   Saturday's was the third bloody confrontation in Tibet between
authorities and anti-Chinese protesters since October 1987. At least
38 people were killed in the earlier clashes, and hundreds were
arrested.
   The Beijing government, which claims Tibet has been part of China
since the 13th century, moved troops into the remote region in 1950.
Tibet was then ruled by a Buddhist theocracy headed by the Dalai
Lama, who fled to India when the Chinese put down a 1959 uprising.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Mitchell Will Need Maine Repertoire as Senate
Chief</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   George Mitchell was four or five years
old when he dropped to his hands and knees, crawled unseen beneath
the toll collector's window and then sprinted to the far end of the
pedestrian bridge.
   ``One of the rituals of growing up here was to skip across
without paying the toll,'' said Mitchell, 55, pointing to the narrow
span where workers once paid two cents to cross the river to jobs in
the mill.
   Mitchell was home in Maine last week after being elected by his
Democratic colleagues to become majority leader of the U.S. Senate.
He will lead rituals of lawmaking far more embroidered than the
childhood challenge of the bridge.
   But back home, Mitchell showed himself as a homespun fellow who
doesn't forget the lessons of his life. And in a series of meetings
around the state, he demonstrated a political repertoire he's
destined to employ in the thicket inside the Capitol.
   _DISAGREE BUT DON'T ARGUE. ``The fact is that issues come and go,
and on any public policy there are valid arguments on both sides,''
he tells an audience in the Lawrence High School gymnasium.
   _KEEP BRAGGING IN ITS PLACE, a place like your home state. This
is a constant in Mitchell's banter, even when it approaches the
ridiculous. ``Those are the best bagels in America right there,'' he
said, passing a bakery in Bangor. He went on to explain to a
skeptical reporter that ``the reason is they're not really bagels,
they're much lighter.''
   Down the street was ``the best salad bar in America.'' The town
also had the best 4th of July parade, and for this Mitchell offered
a plausible explanation. ``It's the best parade to march in because
it's all downhill,'' he said.
   _REMEMBER THE SHORTCUTS. ``Turn left after Dexter shoes,'' he
ordered an aide, as they rushed to make an appointment in Ellsworth.
The back road reduced the trip, and if Mitchell can find shortcuts
through the Senate's legislative logjam his colleagues will make him
a hero.
   _DON'T GET TOO COCKY. ``He doesn't really have the opportunity to
savor the Senate majority leader (election) too long,'' explains
brother Paul, who was joyously trading insults with his younger
brother across their sister's kitchen table.
   ``You know what Paul would say about the deficit? `Let's spend
it,''' the senator says.
   _TAKE SOME BLAME, especially when it's yours for the taking. When
a citizen at a town meeting refers to the federal deficit as
``Reagan Republican,'' the eight-year senator concedes that ``in
fairness, I think we're part of the problem too.''
   _ENJOY YOUR JOB. Mitchell in Presque Isle receives three packages
of imported vegetables from potato farmers who are considering using
Japanese or European vacuum-processing methods of preservation.
   ``I get paid for this,'' exults Mitchell, fascinated by the
products and the possibilities of using the new system to make more
U.S. food available to developing countries that lack refrigeration.
His task: to find ways to counter Canadian subsidies which might put
the plant across the border.
   _TAKE IT, TO A POINT. A constituent in Talmadge, the only
precinct in the state Mitchell lost in November when he won his
second full Senate term, blasts him for opposing efforts to outlaw
all abortions.
   Mitchell had enough, however, when the man likened him to
``pimps, prostitutes and witches.'' The constituent, he said, was
trying to practice guilt by association and Mitchell backed him
down, winning kudos from the crowd even though most disagree with
him on the issue.
   _TAKE IT WITH HUMOR. A Bangor constituent suggested a solution to
the nation's foreign debt of biblical proportions: have all nations
wipe the slate clean and start over again. ``Well, it has the
advantage of being a dramatic proposal,'' Mitchell said, drawing a
chuckle from the others at the town meeting but not at the expense
of the woman making the proposal.
   In the Senate, Mitchell will have 99 constituents, 54 other
Democrats and 45 Republicans. And they mostly have bigger egos and
less self-sufficiency than the good people of Maine.
   He'll need all the skills he uses at his town meetings, and
possibly a few he doesn't show his constituents.
   Such as sneaking past the toll booth, if that's what's needed to
get to the other side.

   There were cats with no hair. Cats with too
much. Blow-dried cats. Brushed cats. Cats from animal shelters and
cats with pedigrees to meow about.
   The 600 felines at the International Cat Show held in San
Francisco this weekend attracted more than 8,000 humans.
   ``Most of us have multiple breeds,'' said Bill Schumacher of
Albuquerque, N.M. ``I own a Persian, several Maine Coons and

   He said cats undoubtedly reflect their owners' personalities.
   ``If a person is very flamboyant and outspoken, they'll go for a
flashy cat, like a black or white Persian,'' said Schumacher.
``Someone who is shy and reserved would go for a much more mellow
cat, a British Blue or an American Shorthair.
   ``But a lot of people like bigger and better so they go for the
big cats like Maine Coons or Rag Dolls, which are 36 inches long.''
   A cat named Elvis won the Supercat Contest. The long-haired
Siamese and tabby mix is named for singer Elvis Costello.
   His owner, Linn Hom, said she may enter her $25 cat from an
animal shelter in future contests, but she won't alter his strict
training regimen: ``All he does is sleep and eat all day.''

   Patriot Patrick Henry showed up in
this southern Illinois town. Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee have
visited, too.
   Their appearances have been thanks to teacher Phil Alsman, who
began dressing up in historical costumes to perk up his ``boring''
history classes.
   ``After Christopher Columbus, I even had a couple of kids come
after me wanting autographs,'' said Alsman, laughing. ``I had one
woman call me up and say, `Will you tell my boy Christopher Columbus
is dead?'''
   Alsman, 42, conceived his gimmick three years ago when he was
tapped to teach history to seventh graders. He had taught science
for 16 years, but his history background was limited.
   ``To me, it was very boring,'' he said. ``I felt that they needed
something that they could relate to at that time.''
   So the next day he came dress up as Patrick Henry for a class on
the Revolutionary War.
   Alsman, who has no formal acting training, recalled the first
time he wore the costume he felt ``silly.''
   ``You ought to see all the people give me second looks,'' he
said. ``I don't know who was more dumbfounded, the students or the
staff _ because teachers don't dress weird.''
   Alsman became principal of Arlington Grade School in September.
But that hasn't stopped his theatrics.
   He's treated the school to Christopher Columbus and ``the unknown
pilgrim.'' He also performs before civic groups.
   ``Once I get into the costume, I never respond to anything other
than that person,'' said Alsman. ``It's serious to me because I
think American history is not something to be laughed about.''

   The state has $3 million in checks it
can't seem to give away.
   Companies and residents across Pennsylvania have not cashed
thousands of checks worth almost $3 million issued by the state
Treasury Department in 1984, 1985, and 1986.
   Even governmental agencies have been lax. In 1986, for example,
about 25 checks to townships, boroughs, cities and county
governments totaling more than $30,000 were uncashed, according to
department records.
   The blame may simply lie in the foibles of human nature, but for
department officials it's a serious problem they're trying to solve.
   ``Why haven't they been cashed? Who knows?'' said Greg Penney,
executive assistant to state Treasurer G. Davis Greene Jr. ``You
almost have to ask the question `Why haven't auditors caught this?'
''
   The volume of unclaimed payments has led the Treasury Department
to start a program to trace the recipients of wayward checks.
   Since Nov. 21, Edward L. Short, director of the Treasury's Bureau
of Investigation, and his staff have returned $38,640 to various
municipalities.
   ``Human nature being what it is (the recipients) just put them in
drawers or use them as book marks. Or kids find checks of their
parents after they've died. We're just trying to get money back to
the people,'' Short said.

   Peace is as rare today as the Ceylon of
antiquity, when Marco Polo marveled at the fist-sized gems and Arab
traders called the island ``Serendib,'' a place of pleasant
surprises.
   The surprises now are routinely nasty.
   The Indian Ocean nation, once likened to paradise by the poets,
has become the battleground of a sectarian conflict between two of
the world's most tolerant religions, Hinduism and Buddhism.
   Tamil rebels, seeking independence for their ethnic minority,
butcher civilians of the Buddhist Sinhalese majority and turn their
guns and swords on the previously unthreatened Moslem community.
   Sinhalese militants, infuriated at the government's efforts to
make peace with the Tamils, wage a campaign of terror and
intimidation that some observers fear could force cancellation of
Dec. 19 presidential elections.
   Hit squads, in turn, hunt and kill the Sinhalese radicals they
blame for the escalating violence.
   ``A dark veil of anarchy and bloodshed has descended on our
country,'' said Sirimavo Bandaranaike, former prime minister and the
presidential candidate of the main opposition Sri Lanka Freedom
Party.
   Opposition parties, the powerful Buddhist clergy and human rights
and labor organizations have repeatedly urged a caretaker
government, saying it would help defuse the crisis on an island once
considered a model of economic progress and stability in the Third
World.
   With less than two weeks left in office, President Junius R.
Jayewardene has resisted the calls, saying he will dissolve
Parliament and then step aside once his successor is chosen.
   The Buddhist Sinhalese and the Hindu Tamils, both descendents of
migrants from India, have been battling each other for more than
2,500 years.
   The contemporary problem ignited in 1983, when the Tamils
exploded their campaign for a separate homeland in the north and
east into a guerrilla war, contending the Sinhalese rejected their
language, denied them jobs and gave them too little money for
education and development.
   Nearly 10,000 people have died in the fighting, more than 500,000
have been routed from their homes, and the economy, once buoyed by a
booming tourist industry, is in ruins.
   In July 1987, with the help of neighboring India, the regional
power in South Asia and home of 60 million Tamils, the government
signed a peace accord aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency in Sri
Lanka.
   The pact guaranteed some automony to the Tamils and for the first
time publicly stated that the Sinhalese-dominated government was
willing to share power. It also invited India to send troops to Sri
Lanka to end the war and supervise the accord.
   Jayewardene took political risks when he accepted the accord,
angering opposition politicians, religious leaders and even some
members of his Cabinet.
   The most militant Tamils rejected the accord, saying it didn't
meet enough of their demands for self-rule. The Sinhalese, who make
up 75 percent of the island's 16 million people, said the government
had sold out to the Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the
population.
   Indian troops soon were fighting the very people they were sent
to protect. More than 625 soldiers have died in the fighting.
   The People's Liberation Front, a shadowy group forced underground
after a 1971 attempted coup, emerged and vowed to kill anyone who
supports the accord.
   The front, better known for its violent acts than its Marxist
ideology, within 16 months had been blamed for more than 900
political murders and nearly succeeding in assassinating Jayewardene
in a daring grenade attack in Parliament.
   Only one of the three presidential candidates, Ossie
Abeygoonsekera of the United Socialist Alliance, has dared to openly
criticize the front, and he nearly paid with his life. Twice in less
than a month, Sinhalese militants hurled bombs into his campaign
rallies, killing eight people and injuring more than 150.
   Neither Mrs. Bandaranaike nor Prime Minister Ramasinghe
Premadasa, the candidate of the governing United National Party, has
indicated how they propose to tackle the front if elected. In an
apparent bid to buy peace, both have steered clear of criticizing
the front.
   The front, however, has turned its guns on them.
   Both have canceled campaign rallies because of threats. When the
front demanded all Freedom Party officeholders in the south, the
Sinhalese heartland, either quit or be killed, a number obeyed and
prominently displayed their resignation letters.
   ``The task of creating a new era to solve the country's problems,
of providing a new leadership, of building a new nation is in our
hands,'' Rohana Wijeweera, leader of the front, said in a rare
interview recently with The Sunday Times newspaper.
   ``The members of our party are willing to sacrifice their lives
for their country and people. When our members are willing to lead
the people at the risk of torture and death, the people will have to
make at least a small sacrifice to liberate the country,'' said
Wijeweera, who has been compared privately by senior government
officials to Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge widely held
responsible for the deaths of 1 million Cambodians from 1975-79.
   Last month, in its most daring effort yet to destabilize the
government, the front told government and other employees to stay
away from work or be killed.
   Shops, banks and post offices closed their doors, and trains sat
idle in the railyards. Troops drove public buses, manned ports and
operated gasoline stations.
   Jayewardene responded by arming the military with unprecedented
powers, including the right to shoot anyone participating in
anti-government demonstrations, and decreeing death by hanging for
anyone instigating protests or writing, printing, distributing or
displaying threatening posters.
   To counter threats to workers, authorities declared employees who
failed to report for work at essential services would be dismissed.
Most refused despite the warning, apparently believing it was safer
to disobey the government than risk the militants' wrath.
   The threats, however, have spawned squads that authorities say
killed at least 25 suspected Sinhalese militants this month. Most
have gathered beneath the mantle of the People's Revolutionary Red
Army, believed to be comprised of paramilitary forces and members of
the United Socialist Alliance, a union of four leftist parties.
   Posters showing grisly photographs of the front's victims and
commanding ``Kill Wijeweera'' have been plastered throughout the
capital.
   ``Right now, it seems the government only controls a few army and
police posts and Colombo,'' said one military official, who cannot
be identified under briefing rules. ``And on some days, not even
Colombo.''

<HEAD>US Banker Has New Scheme to Cut Third World Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading international banker has a new plan
to reduce the burden of debt owed by the Third World without cost to
taxpayers in the United States and other creditor countries.
   ``The objective of lower debt service is sound and necessary for
some (debtor countries), at least for a time,'' says Pedro-Pablo
Kuczynski, chairman of First Boston International. ``But the idea of
using taxpayers' dollars to achieve what the market is already
doing, albeit partially, is not.''
   Third World debt is expected to reach $1.2 trillion by the end of
this year, and debt service has become an increasing drain on
nations that can least afford it. The World Bank estimates that in
1987 Third World transfers to richer countries were $29 billion.
Traditionally the flow had been in the other direction, in the same
way that money flowed from Europe to this country when it was
developing in the 19th century.
   In an article for the current issue of the magazine
``International Economy,'' Kuczynski proposes dividing the debts of
countries such as Brazil and Mexico into two parts. Interest
payments and delayed payments of principal on the first part would
continue, but with the size of the debt discounted _ possibly by 40
cents on the dollar.
   How much of the debt that portion should contain would be
established in a deal between the commercial banks and the World
Bank, which is owned by 151 governments. They include both debtor
and creditor countries.
   On the second part, Kuczynski would require payments by a debtor
country only under two conditions: if it earned more from world
trade than an agreed amount, and if its reserves of gold and hard
currency were greater than the projected payments. If those
conditions were fulfilled in any given year, the World Bank would
call on the debtor to pay at least part of the interest and
principal owed. Total payments could be as little as 10 percent and
as much as 125 percent of the debt.
   This plan would go on for 10 years. At the end of that time, the
debt in the second portion of the plan would be considered paid off.
Payments on the first portion would continue.
   Kuczynski estimated in a telephone interview that his plan could
save heavily indebted Latin American countries as much as $13
billion a year in the first few years. Later the savings would be
less, but the countries would be in a better position to pay.
   A World Bank spokesman said officials are now reading Kuczynski's
proposal and would have no immediate comment.
   Kuczynski said a way should be found for the billions of dollars
in reserves already put aside by creditor banks like his own to be
used for a temporary reduction in payments by debtors. He suggested
that this is already being done, to some extent.
   ``In order to get their interest back from the larger debtors,
(the commercial banks) are themselves putting up about 30 percent of
it in refinancing,'' he wrote.
   ``Lenders might be willing to give up some principal now if they
have a chance of recouping it later with gains.''
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev proposed last week that many
debts be forgiven, payments on others by the poorest countries be
delayed for as long as a century, and a new international body set
up to buy remaining debt at a discount.
   The last proposal is similar to one in the Trade Act that
President Reagan signed last August, but neither Gorbachev nor the
new law suggested who should bear the cost.
   ``The Soviets themselves could not expect to take advantage of
anything like my plan,'' Kuczynski said. ``They owe a pile of money
themselves but they have to be very scrupulous about keeping up with
all their payments.''

<HEAD>Social Security, Taxes Eyed By Deficit Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican co-chairman of the National
Economic Commission says the government should consider taking back
some of the Social Security benefits paid to higher-income
individuals.
   Drew Lewis expressed optimism Sunday that the 12-member panel
eventually will produce a consensus report on cutting the federal
deficit, with the emphasis on reduced federal spending.
   ``The position all of us have taken is that we're going to
address this based on cutting the spending,'' Lewis, a former
transportation secretary in the Reagan administration, said on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' program.
   However, he added, ``this does not mean if we are not able to
address the issue on that basis, that there are not a number of
members on the commission who would prefer a tax increase.''
   Lewis specifically mentioned, as ``a last resort,'' some sort of
consumption tax that would be adjusted according to each
individual's ability to pay.
   He also offered the term ``rebates'' to describe other revenue
sources which do not involve raising taxes. Among these rebates, he
said, would be taking back some of the Social Security benefits paid
to people with other incomes over $90,000 a year, and collecting
repayment of some Medicare benefits from the estates of wealthy
elderly recipients who die.
   Lewis said he did not think much of the savings could be achieved
in military spending. ``Over half the budget is now in entitlements
and interest. Unfortunately, that's where we're going to have to go
if we're going to find reductions in spending,'' he said.
   Lewis' Democratic counterpart on the panel. Robert Strauss,
appeared on the same program and said he believes that simply
cutting spending won't be enough.
   ``I must tell you that in my judgment I have not found sufficient
spending cuts to make up the shortfall'' in meeting a
deficit-reducing target, said Strauss.
   Such a finding by the panel would be directly at odds with
President-elect Bush's campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Democrats
are turning up the heat for Bush to show how he would close the $35
billion gap in meeting next year's deficit-reduction goal.
   ``I haven't seen a way to get there without some increased
revenue. Hopefully we'll find it. If we don't, I'm going to be for
some increased revenue,'' said Strauss, a former Democratic national
chairman.
   Tax increases, while viewed as political poison, have been
identified by many economists as the only realistic way to slash
deficits and calm nervous financial markets. Though Strauss has
expressed similar opinions in the past, he was unusually blunt in
Sunday's public appraisal.
   Strauss said he would consider so-called ``sin taxes'' on alcohol
and tobacco, or a gasoline or other broad-based energy tax, as
likely sources for the needed revenue.
   Such ideas have received broad support from many members of
Congress. Strauss also agreed that Social Security payments to
high-income Americans _ such as himself _ should be taxed.
   Upper-income recipients of Social Security now pay taxes on half
their benefits under a provision that was part of a 1983 change in
the law. Some commission witnesses have suggested boosting that
level to 85 percent.

   Black students especially in the South are far
more likely than whites to be targets of corporal punishment or
school suspension, according to a study.
   ``Teachers often overreact to blacks, especially black males.
Interestingly, that's true even with black teachers,'' said Joan
McCarty First, executive director of the Boston-based National
Coalition of Advocates for Students, which Sunday released an
analysis of federal school data.
   The report found black youngsters are more than twice as likely
to be hit or be labeled mentally retarded as whites. And while
blacks make up 16 percent of the school population, they comprise
only 8 percent of those in gifted student programs.
   The findings were based on an analysis of biennial data published
by the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights in
1986, the latest year available. The coalition study projected the
rates at which students of different races suffered various school
penalties.
   The coalition found that the 10 states with the biggest
black-white disparities in the rate of corporal punishment were
nearly all southern: Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Florida, New
Mexico, Ohio, Georgia, Indiana, Arizona and Oklahoma.
   Nationwide, male students account for 80 percent of corporal
punishment incidents and 70 percent of suspensions, the study found.
   It shed little light, however, on why blacks seem to bear the
brunt of school penalties.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, called the analysis ``disheartening'' and said the
study indicated that teachers and administrators sometimes respond
in a racist manner to certain students.
   ``We have our own built-in prejudices about the way certain kids
can learn, or how they talk, or how they walk or dress,'' she said.
``I don't see a lot of efforts to counter that.''
   Jane Usdan, a spokeswoman for the American Federation of
Teachers, said her union rejected racism as the explanation.
   ``It's clear that there are problems. Schools aren't reaching the
majority of the students we need to reach. Teachers need the
flexibility to meet the needs of individual students,'' she said.
   First said the results don't mean blacks and other minority
students are breaking school rules more often than whites.
   Instead, she said, ``teachers tend to react out of their
frustration and irritation.''
   She said few school districts have systematic controls over
discipline, such as requiring teachers to document in writing why a
student was referred for discipline. It means students are often
punished for trivial offenses, she said.
   Among the report's findings:
   _ Nationwide, 5.22 percent of black students received corporal
punishment, compared with only 2.28 percent of whites and 2.05
percent of Hispanics.
   Arkansas had the biggest statewide disparity in corporal
punishment rates: 22.57 percent of blacks received such punishment,
compared with 10.99 percent of whites, and 5.64 percent of Hispanics.
   Among the nation's 100 largest school districts, the largest
black-white disparities were in Lee County, Fla.; Orange County,
Fla.; Nashville-Davidson County, Tenn.; Polk County, Fla.;
Montgomery, Ala.; Seminole County, Fla.; Pinellas County, Fla.;
Brevard County, Fla.; Hillsborough County, Fla.; and Arlington,
Texas.
   _ Nationwide, 9.07 percent of blacks, 4.44 percent of Hispanics,
and 4.05 percent of whites were suspended from school.
   The racial imbalance in suspension rates was largest in Ohio:
blacks were suspended at a projected 16 percent rate, Hispanics at
9.54 percent, whites at 4.8 percent.
   Among the largest districts, the biggest racial disparities in
suspension rates were in the Alpine School District, in American
Fork, Utah; Long Beach, Calif.; Lee County, Fla.; Sacramento,
Calif.; Baltimore County, Md.; Los Angeles; Pinellas County, Fla.;
Seminole County, Fla.; Minneapolis; and San Francisco.
   _ Blacks nationwide were placed in special classes for the
``educable mentally retarded'' at a 2.3 percent rate, while 0.87
percent of whites and 0.56 percent of Hispanics were similarly
labeled.
   Alabama exhibited the greatest differences: blacks were labeled
``educable mentally retarded'' at a 6.13 percent rate, compared with
1.99 percent of whites, and 0.79 percent of Hispanics.
   Among the largest school districts, the largest black-white
disparities existed in Montgomery, Ala.; Detroit; Jefferson County,
Ala.; Wake County, N.C.; Gwinnett County, Ga.; Escambia County,
Fla.; Forsyth County-Winston Salem, N.C.; Tulsa, Okla.; Mobile,
Ala.; and Omaha, Neb.
   _ 5.35 percent of white pupils get placed in gifted programs
nationwide, compared with 2.44 percent among blacks and 2.41 percent
among Hispanics.
   The differences were largest in South Carolina, where whites were
placed in such programs at a 9.46 percent rate, compared with 5.62
percent of Hispanics and 2.03 percent of blacks.
   Large school districts with the biggest black-white disparities
in gifted placements were Austin, Texas; Atlanta;
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C.; New Orleans; El Paso, Texas; Wake
County, N.C.; Oakland, Calif.; Greenville County, S.C.; San
Francisco; and Omaha, Neb.

   Arab educators say they face
a difficult task trying to motivate children deprived of classroom
learning during Israel's long closure of West Bank schools.
   They say they fear the system may never fully recover.
   After a nearly 10-month shutdown, elementary schools are again
abuzz with children's chatter. Junior high schools reopened Sunday
and high schools are to resume next week, bringing all 300,000 West
Bank students back to classes.
   But, Arab educators warn, the West Bank's 1,194 schools may never
achieve the same standard they maintained before being closed last
Feb. 3, remaining shot for all but a few weeks since.
   ``In the limited period we have to catch up for nearly a year of
lost education, I'm sure our standards will decline,'' said Khalil
Mahshi, principal of the Quaker-run Friends Boys' School in
Ramallah. ``The quality of education we could provide before the
closure has definitely been lost.''
   Army officials say schools were closed because they had turned
into breeding grounds for protests during the year-old revolt
against 21 years of Israeli occupation.
   Authorities have indefinitely closed West Bank universities and
colleges and Brig. Gen. Shaike Erez, head of the West Bank military
administration, has warned that other schools will stay open only if
they are ``used for learning and not for demonstrations.''
   According to Palestinian educators, the closures have brought
myriad difficulties, ranging from a decline in enrollment to
unmotivated students who have lost the discipline of regular study.
   ``Our No. 1 problem is getting the children into the habit of
coming to school regularly again,'' said Abdullah Rishmawi,
principal of Ramallah's Lutheran School.
   ``For almost a full year, these children have been in the habit
of watching TV until late at night and getting up at 9 or 10 in the
morning. Now we are asking them to get back into the swing of school
discipline. It is not going to be easy.''
   The task of catching up is further complicated by closure orders
from the Palestine Liberation Organization. School officials will
comply, closing at noon instead of the usual 1 p.m. for public
schools and 3 p.m. for private schools.
   Even though last year's academic term was unfinished, West Bank
students were automatically promoted _ often, educators fear, at the
expense of basic skills.
   ``They have moved on to the next grade, but this really means
nothing,'' Mahshi said. ``In terms of learning, these students have
lost a year.''
   Especially at risk, he said, are children in the primary grades.
   ``There are critical periods in a child's life when he begins to
learn skills like reading, writing and numbers,'' Mahshi said. ``If
you miss that period, although he may eventually learn to read, a
person will never reach the same level of competency.''
   Palestinian attempts at alternative study during the school
closures were quickly outlawed by the Israeli army, which claimed
they were organized to incite civil unrest.
   Last month, Mahshi and Rishmawi were called into Ramallah's
military headquarters after they distributed home study assignments.
They said the army ordered them to stop.
   ``They said the school closures were to pressure parents into
understanding what they were losing and home study counteracted
this,'' Mahshi said.
   The frequent clashes and mass arrests of the uprising _ in which
at least 322 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed _ have
also taken a psychological toll on students.
   ``Our first job every day is to play the clown and try to get the
children to smile. They arrive frowning and sad, traumatized by some
family encounter with the army,'' Rishmawi said.
   ``But we just don't have the resources to deal with the more
severe effects of stress: nightmares, bed wetting, depression,'' he
said.
   Enrollment in West Bank schools has dropped considerably as
Arab-American students left for schools in the United States and
hundreds of others enrolled in Jerusalem schools.
   The student body at the Friends School is expected to be 250,
compared with 470 students last year.
   Bir Zeit University English professor Nahala Assali estimates
about 25 percent of the territory's 18,000 college students also
left to study in the United States, Europe and the elsewhere in Arab
world.
   ``Anything that causes our young people to leave the West Bank is
consistent with Israeli aims,'' she said.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is based
on telephone interviews conducted Nov. 10-20 with 1,084 adults in
the continental United States.
   The phone numbers were selected randomly by computer, and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample.
The poll has a 3 percentage-point margin of error, meaning that if
every adult American were asked the same questions, the results
theoretically would be within 3 points of the poll's results, 19 of
20 times. The error margin is larger for subgroups _ 5 points, for
example, for Southerners.
   Other sources of potential error in polls include the wording and
order of questions.
   The questions and responses in this poll follow; because of
rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Do you celebrate Christmas? Yes: 96 percent. No: 5 percent.
   2. Are the Christmas holidays something you look forward to, or
not? Yes: 87. No: 13. Don't know-no answer: 1.
   3. Do you think of Christmas more as a religious occasion, or a
family and social occasion? Religious: 26. Family, social: 34. Both:
38. Neither: 1. DK-NA: 1.
   4. Do you think Christmas is too commercialized? Yes: 85. No: 14.
DK-NA: 2.
   5. How many people will you be giving Christmas gifts to this
year? None: 3. One-two: 2. Three-five: 8. Six-nine: 16. Ten-14: 28.
Fifteen-20: 21. Twenty-plus: 20. DK-NA: 3.
   6. Compared to the last few years, will you spend more money on
gifts this Christmas season, or less money, or about the same
amount? More: 27. Less: 23. Same: 48. DK-NA: 2.
   7. Stop me when I get to the sum that you expect to spend on
Christmas gifts this year: Less than $50: 3. $50-$100: 7. $100-$200:
18. $200-$300: 19. $300-$500: 22. More than $500: 26. DK-NA: 5.
   8. Do you usually receive the gifts you really want for
Christmas, or not? Yes: 70. No: 25. DK-NA: 5.
   9. Generally, do you attend church services during the year? Yes:
69. No: 30.
   9a. (If yes) have you been to church services within the past
week? Yes: 61. No: 39.

   Most Americans intend to spend at least $200 on
Christmas gifts this season, and one in four will spend at least
$500, a Media General-Associated Press poll shows.
   Given those expenses, it's not surprising that a vast majority of
Americans _ 85 percent _ say they believe Christmas is too
commercialized.
   Still, a plurality celebrate the holiday as a religious, not just
a social, occasion.
   The survey of 1,084 adults in the continental United States was
conducted by telephone Nov. 10-20.
   The poll suggested that Americans remain strongly religious and
have a deep fondness for the Christmas season. But it also showed
significant differences in viewpoints among regions and age groups.
   Eighty-nine percent of those answering the poll identified
themselves as Catholic or Protestant; the rest were Jewish,
``other,'' or had no religion.
   Ninety-six percent of respondents said they celebrate Christmas
and 87 percent said they look forward to the Christmas holidays.
   About a third thinks of Christmas as mainly a social holiday, and
about one-quarter regard it as primarily religious. The largest
number _ 38 percent _ consider it religious and social.
   The poll also showed that nearly seven in 10 Americans are
churchgoers, and four in 10 had been to church the week before the
poll. Sixty-four percent said they generally go to church on
Christmas.
   The poll suggested that Americans are in a somewhat more generous
mood this holiday season than they were seven years ago, when an
AP-NBC News poll showed that 69 percent intended to cut back on gift
spending.
   In the new poll, nearly half said they'll spend the same as they
have for the last few years; 27 percent will spend more. Only 23
percent said they intend to spend less.
   Sixty-nine percent said they intend to give gifts to at least 10
other people, and only 3 percent will be giving to none. Twenty
percent will be giving to 20 or more people.
   Finally, seven in 10 people say they usually receive the gifts
they really want; one in four don't.
   The poll indicated that Americans who live in the South and
Midwest have stronger religious traditions than those in the West
and Northeast, and that black Americans are more religiously
observant than whites, conservatives more than liberals, Catholics
more than Protestants.
   For instance, 75 percent of those in the South and 71 percent of
those in the north-central states said they attended church services
during the year, compared with 69 percent in the Northeast and 57
percent in the West.
   Eighty-three percent of blacks are churchgoers, compared with 69
percent of whites; 75 percent of conservatives compared with 56
percent of liberals; 76 percent of Catholics compared with 71
percent of Protestants.
   The poll also showed that younger adults are more likely to look
forward to Christmas than their elders, and that they also are much
more likely to view Christmas as a primarily social, not religious,
holiday.
   Overall the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points, but a somewhat higher error rate for answers
involving subgroups.

   The 20 men and 12 women named American Rhodes
Scholars represent 26 states and include a martial arts expert and a
23-year-old doctoral candidate who started college at age 12.
   Many of those awarded 1989 Rhodes Scholarships for two years of
study at Oxford University in England showed strong interest in
using their education to battle AIDS, poverty, hunger and
homelessness, said David Alexander, American secretary of the Rhodes
Scholarship Trust.
   The group includes students with aspirations in politics,
medicine and writing, Alexander said Sunday, adding that at least
three worked to support themselves while attending college.
   The scholarship recipients were chosen during meetings held
nationwide Wednesday and Saturday.
   Four winners are from New York, three from Ohio and two from
Oklahoma.
   Harvard University had with five winners, Yale had four and
Stanford two.
   One of the winners, Holly Wyatt of San Clemente, works 20 hours a
week as a waitress and squeezes in volunteer work with the Meals on
Wheels organization for the needy while attending the University of
Southern California.
   Ms. Wyatt expects to graduate in May with a double major in
political science and international relations with a minor in peace
and conflict studies.
   ``When I finish at Oxford I would like to work at an
international institution,'' she said. ``I would like to work in
arms control, like in western European-United States relations.
   ``Someday, I think I'd like to teach college. But I'd like to
have some kind of effect on policy first,'' she said.
   Another winner was Gregory Peter Dubois, who entered New College
of the University of Southern Florida at age 12. Dubois, who has
published numerous research papers in high energy physics, expects
to receive his doctoral degree from the California Institute of
Technology next year.
   Another winner was Barry Uphoff, who won first place in a
second-degree black belt taekwondo competition in 1986 and was
ranked among the nation's top 10 competitors in the martial arts
field in 1986 and 1987.
   Uphoff, a natural sciences and public health major at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore, plans to study law at Oxford before
going to medical school.
   The Rhodes Scholarships were established in 1902 by the estate of
Cecil Rhodes, a British philanthropist and colonialist. He had hoped
the scholarships would contribute to world understanding and peace.
   Among the qualities sought in scholars are proven intellectual
and academic excellence, integrity, respect for others, the ability
to lead and use their talents fully.
   Scholarship winners will receive college and university fees and
a stipend to cover living expenses.
   Women have been allowed to apply since 1976.
   A total of 2,532 American students who have received the
scholarships since the program started in 1903.
   To qualify, scholars must be unmarried and between ages 18 and 24.

<TEXT>
   From the Jewish state of Israel to the Moslem nation of Iran, the
earthquake in Soviet Armenia spurred nations across the world to set
aside political differences and rush to the aid of the stricken
Soviets.
   Children opened their piggy banks, musicians offered their art
and a search dog wearing a Star of David on his chest was flown into
the region as part of an international mission of mercy.
   The Red Cross and Red Crescent relief organizations announced
that 23 countries worldwide collected about $44 million in aid, the
official Soviet news agency Tass reported Sunday.
   In Montreal, the donations were so great they couldn't all fit
onto one plane. A Soviet aircraft loaded with about 80 search and
rescue workers, six dogs and 9{ tons of medical supplies and winter
clothing was delayed for hours at Mirabel Airport on Sunday while
workers tried to cram everything aboard.
   Armenians in Iran were organizing a medical team and collecting
money to help victims, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   Though Soviet-Iranian relations improved somewhat with the
increasing U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf, they have
often been strained. Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has
backed Moslem rebels fighting Soviet and government troops in
Afghanistan.
   In Jerusalem, a 42-member Israeli rescue team headed by an army
general flew to Yerevan, the Armenian capital, to help search for
earthquake survivors.
   The team included experts specially trained in operating heavy
cranes, several doctors, and an Alsatian shepherd dog named Tim, who
is trained to sniff people under rubble and wore a red Star of David
on a white chest cloth.
   Two other planes were scheduled to fly to the Soviet Union today
with a 46-member medical team, equipment and 4{ tons of medical
supplies.
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic relations with Israel after the
1967 Middle East war and does not officially recognize the Jewish
state, but relations have been gradually warming.
   The United States' Armenian community collected millions of
dollars for relief.
   ``This little girl came with her grandfather, and she apparently
had a piggy bank that she was saving for Christmas. She said
`Grandpa, instead of me getting something, why don't I give this'''
said Hazel Barsamian, who is working with the Armenian Relief
Society's Chicago chapter.
   A hastily assembled telethon that ran from midnight Saturday to 6
a.m. Sunday on the West Coast drew $2.9 million in pledges, said Los
Angeles station KSCI-TV. The telethon was shown on that station, on
cable channels throughout Southern California, and on independent
stations in Houston; Norfolk, Va.; Seattle; San Francisco; and
Sacramento, Calif.
   In Washington, President Reagan told reporters that four U.S.
planes had already arrived in Armenia to provide help.
   The London branch of Moscow Narodny Bank, the Soviet state bank,
said late Sunday that donations to earthquake relief from the
British public had reached $1.04 million.
   Organizers of British relief efforts announced a London concert
to raise money for victims. Conductor Andre Previn, flutist James
Galway and cellist Mstislav Rostropovich are among those scheduled
to perform Saturday.
   Almost 30 tons of emergency relief supplies, mostly blankets and
clothing, were flown out of London's Heathrow Airport, officials
said. The supplies were donated mainly by individuals who drove them
to the airport from throughout southern England.
   Not all the relief efforts went smoothly.
   A Dutch medical relief crew was refused visas to assist in the
rescue operations, according to a Red Cross spokesman speaking on
condition of anonymity in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The source
said Soviet diplomats claimed no more foreign relief was needed.
   Some foreign relief workers said they ran into snags upon
reaching the disaster areas.
   ``The relief effort until you reach the spot here has been very
good,'' said Sverre Kilde, a Norwegian U.N. officer. ``But here on
the spot there is no control.''

   Illegal fireworks exploded in a crowded street
market Sunday and started a chain reaction and fire that spread to
five buildings, killing at least 61 people and injuring 45.
   ``We'll be searching all night. They're still finding bodies,''
said Salvador Padillo, the Red Cross commander at the scene.
   Floodlights lit the narrow street and an alley as rescuers dug
into the night, putting bodies on stretchers, tagging them and
putting them in ambulances. A bulldozer began plowing away the
rubble.
   At least 61 people were killed, Commander Enrique Mejia
Guadarrama of the Red Cross said early Monday.
   ``They can't get inside the storerooms, but they are full of
bodies,'' said Roberto Castanon Romo, city director of medical
services. ``You can no longer talk of survivors.''
   At least 11 of the dead were children, officials said.
   Padillo said at least 45 people were injured, but an official on
duty at Red Cross headquarters put the number at 83. Two
firefighters were among the injured, medical workers said.
   The first explosion apparently was in a market stall set up in a
narrow street leading to the popular Merced market and jammed with
Christmas shoppers, said Red Cross worker Jorge Torres San Juan.
   Fire spread to a two-story building of candy and fireworks shops,
where fireworks also were stored, and to a building of candy shops
next door.
   A city legal official, Jesus Sandoval, said the fireworks were
being sold illegally.
   The shops ``were all full of people buying,'' Luis Contreras,
another rescue worker said.
   After the explosions began, an estimated 500 people streamed from
the building screaming, ``Get out, get out,'' said Fernando
Dominguez, who was working in shoe store less than 100 feet away.
   ``At first it sounded like bullets. Then there were more and more
and then the explosion,'' Dominguez said.
   The narrow street was crowded with people buying fireworks for
the celebration of the Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe on Monday.
   The explosion began with one crate of fireworks on the end of the
street nearest the Merced, said Mario Roberto Andrade, who lives
next to one of the buildings that caught fire and was in the street
at the time. He said boxes of fireworks kept exploding down the
street.
   Windows shattered throughout the block. Spent Chinese
firecrackers, charred wood and comic books, twisted metal and
tangles of high tension wires littered the street.
   As smoke billowed from the second floor of the building more than
two hours after the fire was reported at 2:40 p.m., six young men on
the third floor refused to leave.
   ``We're staying here to hold onto our things,'' one shouted to
police. ``If it were your house, you'd do the same.''
   Police sent firemen and police officers into the building.
   By about 5 p.m. fires had been extinguished in a six-story
building across the street and a four-story building down the block.
Some smoke also was coming from one floor of an apartment building.
   For at least an hour, the white smoke could be seen billowing
from the site from more than two miles away. As darkness fell, a
bulldozer began plowing away the rubble.
   Distraught relatives searched for missing relatives while vendors
and residents vented anger at Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis, who walked
through the water-soaked debris of burned metal, canvas street
stalls, and scattered merchandise.
   ``Many children died here, Mr. Mayor,'' said one man.
   Earlier, Victor Gutierrez Cruz, a leader of the area's commercial
association, said it had been protesting illegal sales of fireworks.
He complained that people who don't belong to the group come in and
sell fireworks without permits during the holidays.
   ``These present a great danger .... to the shops,'' he said.
   District Attorney Ignacio Morales Lechuga said that fireworks are
illegal to sell without a permit.
   ``This does not mean there is going to be an attack on Mexican
culture,'' he said. ``These things (fireworks) are part of Mexican
culture.''
   ``It's a case of corruption,'' said Andrade's wife, Angelica
Peredo. ``We don't want street vendors selling fireworks here.''
   For years, the Merced was the main market in this city of 18
million, supplying dozens of other markets and individual customers.
   A new main market was built on the edge of the city in 1982, but
the Merced remains important because of tradition and its location
about half a mile from the main Zocalo Plaza in a densely populated
area.

   Four turtles wielding Ninja weapons,
the brainchildren of a sandwich maker and a self-described hack
cartoonist, are threatening to move into the top 10 of the Christmas
toy market.
   ``They are just flying off the shelves,'' said David Valentine, a
toy industry analyst for Standard & Poors.
   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have hit No. 11 in the Toy & Hobby
World charts of best sellers just four years after they were
conceived by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman during a late-evening
sketching duel.
   Stores report they can't keep up with demand for the goofy
turtles with their slice-and-dice arm action and their silly
one-liners (``One good turtle deserves another'').
   ``It's insane,'' said Eastman, 26. ``Pete and I really had no
idea what we were unleashing. We were just two wild-eyed kids who
just wanted to do comic books.''
   They keep shop in a run-down building on a back street of this
college town.
   Eastman, then an occasional student at the University of
Massachusetts, said he tracked down Laird, who scraped out a living
by drawing illustrations for local newspapers, in 1982 because their
cartoons looked alike. They became fast friends, joined by a love
for Marvel Comics illustrator Jack Kirby.
   The turtles were created after what Eastman called a heavy dose
of ``T.J. Hooker'' and ``Love Boat'' at an apartment the two men
shared while Laird's fiancee finished her studies at the University
of New Hamsphire. Laird was still free-lancing cartoons. Eastman got
by making sandwiches at a restaurant.
   ``We had been watching a bunch of horrible TV and we started
drawing and throwing the stuff at each other,'' Eastman said last
week. ``We found we had this little beastie that we really fell in
love with.''
   The beast soon had three brothers, all named after Renaissance
painters, and a weird history involving a pool of goo in a New York
sewer and a rat with the powers of a Ninja master.
   As the story goes, the turtles were covered by the muck through a
random series of odd accidents. They mutated and grew up under the
rat's tutelage, evolving into superturtles with a taste for pizza
and for doing battle with the Shredder, leader of the most feared
assassins in Japan.
   Valentine considers the turtles the natural descendants of the
tin soldier with appealingly distasteful roots in radioactive gunk.
   ``Kids are into slime,'' he said. ``Anything to gross out their
little sisters.''
   Their creators scraped together $1,200 and printed 3,000 copies
of the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book. The comics
sold out in three weeks and Leonardo, Donatello, Michaelangelo and
Raphael were propelled to fame on T-shirts, cereal boxes and
Saturday morning TV.
   Even avid fan Tom Selleck was filmed reading a turtles comic in
the farewell episode of ``Magnum, P.I.''
   ``It goes way beyond luck,'' Eastman said of their success. ``We
had one of the best black-and-white comics around. We worked hard to
get it to the point where Mark Freedman picked up on it.''
   Freedman, a New York licensing agent, managed to entice a
California company, Playmates, into investing $2.5 million in an
animated television show and launching a line of 10 figurines.
   The turtles were helped by the phenomenon of specialty comic book
stores that have sprung up in the last five years, which have opened
a market for the offbeat.
   ``Everybody says, `You guys must be zillionaires now.' Far from
it,'' said Eastman. He said, however, that the collaborators' annual
income is in the six figures and they now have eight artists working
on the comic strips and other ventures.
   The turtles have long since moved their comic book haunts from
the New York City sewers to the town where their creators have
settled.
   ``They can still get into the city easily from here,'' Eastman
said. ``And we can use people we know for characters.''

   By Christmas, four teams of reindeer from
Operation Santa Claus will have logged 50,000 miles and 110
appearances at shopping malls and resorts across the country.
   ``We have to make hay while the snow flies,'' said Cindy
Gillaspie, who manages the ranch for Troutman Investment Co. with
her husband, Mike.
   ``Santa's got one night and we've got six weeks,'' said Mike
Gillaspie.
   Other reindeer from the ranch are on exhibit at Disneyland and
the Los Angeles Zoo.
   ``The only part of the U.S. we don't hit is the Deep South,''
said Mrs. Gillaspie. ``Part of the reason is the heat, part is
because we just haven't marketed the area and haven generated enough
interest.''
   Most of the reindeer's bookings are through mall merchants
associations for the holiday season, she said. Each team is
accompanied by two trained handlers.
   Mrs. Gillaspie said she knows of no serious competition in her
reindeer-for-hire business. The only herd she knows of that's larger
is at the University of Alaska and it's for research.
   Troutman Investment, an offshoot of a West Coast department store
chain based in Eugene, has no salesmen to market the reindeer.
   ``Just me,'' Mrs. Gillaspie said.
   ``What started out as a June-through-January job has become
year-round work,'' she said. ``But it really doesn't get fast and
furious until the summer months.
   ``People don't want to think about Christmas in February, and
neither do I. But we get started early.''
   When John Zumstein started Operation Santa Claus back in 1950, he
knew little about reindeer.
   ``I got the idea from watching a Christmas show with papier-mache
reindeer,'' said Zumstein, who lives a few miles away from this
central Oregon town now that he has sold the ranch. ``I wondered why
the dickens people didn't have real reindeer, so I questioned
around.''
   San Francisco and Seattle zookeepers told him that they had tried
to keep reindeer, but the arctic natives died.
   Zumstein, who was in the fuel business, had studied animal
husbandry and decided to apply to the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs
for permits to buy 10 reindeer from Eskimos in Alaska.
   He flew his first batch into Portland and trucked them to
Redmond, where he figured the cool, dry, high-desert climate was
more suitable than the rain in the Willamette Valley.
   But they all died. He flew to Alaska and got more. And by trial
and error he figured out how to keep the animals from dying and how
to breed them.
   ``Every time I had bad luck I learned a little bit,'' said
Zumstein.
   He developed a feed formula that worked and learned to watch out
for parasites that overcame the deer when they were transplanted to
a warmer climate.
   At his peak, Zumstein had 80 reindeer on tour to places such as
Tokyo, Honolulu, and Canada as well as the continental United
States. He also was selling reindeer.
   When Zumstein got the herd up to 100 head, he figured he had it
under control. He sold out about 10 years ago.
   Gillaspie now trains the animals to accept a harness and pull a
sleigh.
   Of course, the reindeer are popular with children.
   During a recent visit to the ranch, some children climbed on the
fence at Operation Santa Claus and pointed out one named Rudolph,
even though the young calf with the nubby little antlers had a brown
nose like the others.
   ``His nose doesn't glow because it's sunny,'' said 5-year-old
Jewelle Urell, who was visiting from the Learning Tree preschool in
nearby Prineville. ``It'll glow by Christmas time. I can wait.''

<HEAD>Offers of Aid for Armenia Pour in Nationwide</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LA6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A hastily assembled telethon to aid victims of the devastating
earthquake in Soviet Armenia drew nearly $3 million in pledges, and
one child emptied her piggy bank of money she had saved for
Christmas presents to help.
   Other offers of assistance poured in from around the country,
including teams of search dogs from Alaska, kidney dialysis machines
from an Armenian congregation in Encino, Calif., and a planeload of
medical personnel and equipment from Seattle.
   ``People want to help people in need and we all think that,
`There but for the grace of God go I,''' said Dr. Christy Horton,
medical director of the Seattle-King County Disaster Team.
   Horton and about 100 volunteers spent the weekend lining up
everything from operating equipment and wheelchairs to kerosene
generators and cooking stoves. The group is sending 40 to 50 medical
personnel and nearly 100,000 pounds of medical equipment aboard a
donated cargo plane that's due to take off Tuesday and arrive in the
Armenian capital of Yerevan on Wednesday.
   For the quake-stricken region where tens of thousands have died
and hundreds of thousands were left homeless, no offer of help was
too small.
   ``Little children have come in and given us their Christmas
donations,'' said Hazel Barsamian, who is working with the Armenian
Relief Society in Chicago.
   ``This little girl came with her grandfather and she apparently
had a piggy bank that she was saving for Christmas. She said
`Grandpa, instead of me getting something, why don't I give this?' ''
   Thousands of Armenians prayed Sunday in churches around the
United States.
   ``The point of it is, they are all Armenians and they are all our
relatives,'' Odette Hambarsoomian, 28, said while waiting for Mass
to begin at St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church in the Los Angeles
suburb of Glendale.
   ``It's something that is going to be in Armenian memories
forever.''
   For many, the relief efforts were combined with anxious strivings
for information.
   ``We have tried 300 times to call Armenia, but they say there are
no lines,'' said Saro Diashian, a computer programmer with many
relatives in the hard-hit city of Leninakan, who attended services
at St. Mary's. ``All we can do is just wait and pray and give some
help.''
   In New York, word reached Gerry Nazarian through relatives in
California and Moscow that two cousins had perished in Leninakan.
   ``They were in an office and the entire office building
collapsed,'' he said after Mass at St. Vartan Cathedral. ``It's
terrible, terrible. I couldn't sleep all night. I mean, the whole
family is so upset. It's ... that pain _ you just can't describe
it.''
   Los Angeles station KSCI-TV received $2.9 million in pledges
toward supplies with its spur-of-the-moment telethon, said
spokeswoman Mary Good. The show ran from midnight Saturday to 6 a.m.
Sunday on the West Coast and was shown in Houston, Norfolk, Va.,
Seattle, San Francisco and Sacramento, Calif.
   The congregation at Holy Martyrs Armenian Apostolic Church in
Encino, Calif., bought four kidney dialysis machines, which Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev had requested for treatment of crushing
injuries. In addition to the machines, which are to be shipped
Tuesday, 30 members of the Armenian-American Medical Society of
California volunteered to go to the devastated area, said Armenian
Relief Society spokesman Lee Chakalozian.
   On Saturday, an Occidental Petroleum jet left Los Angeles with
more than a ton of supplies and $1 million for quake victims.
Chairman Armand Hammer, 90, who has long had close ties to Soviet
leaders, arranged the flight.
   Alaskan officials grateful for Soviet help in freeing two trapped
whales in October were arranging to send teams of rescue dogs and
handlers. Gov. Steve Cowper said the teams could be in Armenia by
Tuesday.
   In Cambridge, Mass., Cardinal Bernard Law participated in a Mass
with about 200 Armenians on Sunday and announced that a special
collection made at churches in the Boston Roman Catholic Archdiocese
would go toward relief efforts.
   ``We are working primarily to raise money, because we are not
exactly sure what is needed, except for medical supplies,'' said
Rev. Yeznig Balian at St. Vartan's in New York, the diocesan
headquarters for the eastern branch of the Armenian Church of
America.
   ``The response has been tremendous in every sense, both from
Armenians and non-Armenians.''
   A few minutes earlier, Leroy and Blossom Cashdan walked into the
church offices with an armload of coats and sweaters. ``We're
Jewish, but people are people,'' Cashdan said. ``This is an
overwhelming disaster, so we just felt a need to help.''

   Outside the ruins of 270 Sverdlovsk
St., families picked at the heap of wreckage that used to be home
and prayed that relatives still buried in the rubble might somehow
survive.
   Several people were pulled from the 50-apartment building alive
immediately after Wednesday's earthquake, but by Sunday, relatives
of the missing were losing hope.
   Stacks of red, black or unfinished wood coffins were piled on
street corners.
   Eduard Manoyan knew that his wife, mother-in-law and a
brother-in-law were dead. The three were in a ground floor apartment
when the quake struck.
   Tamara Kazaryan's husband had found his son but not his wife, who
had come home from work for her lunch break when the earth began to
shake and the long, five-story concrete building collapsed.
   ``We don't know whether anyone is alive or not,'' said Mrs.
Kazaryan's husband, a laborer. ``I went to the school where my son
studies. The building was ruined, but he was alive. Then I came home
and started searching for my wife.''
   People were trying to dig out their belongings from one end of
the 15-year-old building, which was built on a slight rise above the
street and had slid into a heap by the roadside. Some worked in a
pile of rubble, digging through the ruins. Others simply milled
about.
   A young man was accused of trying to steal something, and
shouting erupted. Soldiers arrested the man and led him away.
   Everywhere, officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and
heavy equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off
trapped people.
   At one site, rescuers worked feverishly with saws, torches,
hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the
top of what was a nine-story apartment building.
   Survivors who spoke about the tragedy described a series of three
or four quakes separated by brief pauses.
   Mayor Emil Kirokofyan told a group of foreign correspondents that
recently constructed apartment buildings were not built to withstand
such a severe temblor _ even though Leninakan is in an area of
frequent earthquakes.
   Choking back tears, the mayor told reporters he lost 15 relatives.
   Hundreds of bonfires fueled by cardboard, trash or debris
provided the only heat for people who had spent four nights on the
streets. They sent a pall of smoke over the city of 250,000 people.
   ``I don't have anywhere to live. I am homeless,'' cried an old
woman walking out of rescue headquarters, where officials had put
her on a list for new housing.
   Manoyan, a machinist who found his wife and relatives dead,
appealed to the foreign reporters, who were touring the disaster
area at the invitation of the Foreign Ministry.
   ``As a member of the Armenian nation, I ask you to give us
help,'' he said. ``We need equipment. The city is in ruins.''
   Some aid that was given proved useless. After people had been
digging through the rubble with their hands for three days, a crane
arrived Saturday. But the next day, it was parked beside the ruins,
motionless. Workers said it was too small.

<HEAD>Indicted Bakker Urges Forgiveness For Accusers At Service</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: PTL auction at 2 p.m. EST; lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   To shouts of ``hallelujah,'' PTL founder
Jim Bakker preached for the first time since his fraud and
conspiracy indictment and urged followers of his new church to
forgive his accusers.
   ``They ask us, `Why don't you attack your enemies?''' Bakker
said, his voice rising. ``The devil wants me to renounce my
salvation and attack, attack, attack. The Bible says `Love your
enemies.'''
   ``I'm not going to lift a finger to attack my enemies. I'm not
going to lift a finger to vindicate me.'' Bakker said. ``That will
put cold chills down your enemy's spine.''
   During the service for his New Covenant Church, Bakker never
mentioned the 24-count indictment issued last week by a federal
grand jury investigating PTL.
   ``I feel a miracle,'' he told 400 worshipers Sunday gathered at a
roller skating rink. ``And the harder the devil fights, the bigger
the miracle that's coming.''
   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting to a 1980
extramarital sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
PTL filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987 and a
court-appointed trustee has been trying to sell its assets to pay
creditors.
   In Fort Mill, S.C., an auction was scheduled for this afternoon
of PTL's 2,200-acre property, which includes a 500-room hotel, a
theme park, television studio and a 2,000-seat church.
   The only certain bidder, Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick, has
let it be known he intends to offer a total of less than $70 million
cash. A month ago, he said he would pay $115 million, $50 million of
it cash.
   During Sunday's service, Bakker talked about his reaction to
being fingerprinted and having his mugshot taken at the federal
courthouse in Charlotte.
   ``I looked up at all those wanted posters and I thought, `No one
is smiling _ so I smiled,''' Bakker said. ``If I'm going to be on
the walls of post offices, I'm going to smile.''
   Bakker said he and his wife, Tammy, plan to tape several
television specials at their home south of Charlotte.
   ``The old adrenalin is flowing again,'' he said. ``We're excited
to be able to minister to the people again.''
   Mrs. Bakker joined her husband on stage, singing ``This Too Shall
Pass,'' and telling stories of well-wishers who had greeted her in
restaurants and shopping malls.
   Bakker won repeated cries of ``hallelujah'' and ``you got that
right'' from worshipers seated under the fluorescent lights and
mirrored balls of the rink. At one point, most of them left their
metal chairs to gather around him and raise their hands in prayer.
   As one elderly woman left the service, she told reporters, ``The
worse they do Jim, the more we're going to love him.''
   Bakker did not allow reporters inside the building. Some of his
remarks, however, could be heard through the door in the lobby.
   Bakker and three of his former associates were indicted a week
ago today after a 16-month federal grand jury investigation into the
PTL television ministry. Bakker, 48, and Richard Dortch, 57, his
former top deputy at PTL, were accused of diverting more than $4
million of PTL money to support their ``lavish and extravagant''
lifestyles.

   A passenger train ran into the back of a commuter
train in south London this morning, killing two people and injuring
at least 50, a British Transport Police spokesman said.
   The collision occurred at the height of the morning rush hour
near the Clapham Junction station, said the spokesman. He spoke
anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   A spokesman for the London Ambulance Service said the crash
occured at the bottom of an embankment, making it difficult to reach
the injured. However, news reports said one train toppled down the
embankment following the collision.
   Three local hospitals have been alerted, said the ambulance
spokesman, also speaking anonymously, and more than 100 firefighters
were at the scene, along with a fleet of ambulances and a mobile
surgical unit.

   Josh Farnsworth stood on a mountainside with snow
blowing around him and the wind cutting through his coat. He
reluctantly pulled off his mittens to write down the name of the
40-foot tree towering in front of him.
   ``I think I'm going to call it `Three Splits,''' said the
9-year-old, as he scrutinized the maple that split at its base into
three separate trunks. Then, he measured the base with his scarf and
paced off the distance from the tree to a trail marker 15 feet away.
   Josh and other pupils at Derby Elementary School in neary Derby
will use the information to find sponsors for dozens of trees along
the 265-mile Long Trail, a hiking trail that runs north-south from
Massachusetts to Canada.
   The proceeds will be used by the Green Mountain Club to buy some
of the 67 miles of unprotected, privately owned land along the trail.
   ``The Long Trail is one of the treasures of Vermont. This is one
of the few true wilderness experiences on the East Coast,'' said
teacher Doug Westin.
   The project also is introducing dozens of fourth, fifth and sixth
graders to a different way of learning science, history and math,
and a way to apply their skills to benefit their community, he said.
   The Long Trail program, which includes a pupil-produced history
book about the trail, began this fall at a school that has earned a
reputation for developing unusual, creative projects that extend
beyond its red brick borders and into the 4,200-member community on
the Vermont-Quebec border.
   The school just won an award from the American Association for
State and Local History for last year's project, a set of 109 short
stories the pupils prepared and read on a radio station.
   The school also was honored recently as a finalist for the
National Education Association's A+ award for its projects, Westin
said.
   The projects begin in Westin's ``Challenge Room,'' a classroom
where he was told five years ago to establish a program for gifted
pupils.
   But the program is ``really open to anybody in the school who has
a serious interest. It's not just for kids with high IQs,'' said Ed
Hartman, guidance counselor.
   Individual pupils participate for six weeks, three days a week,
about 45 minutes each day. Or the projects can involve entire
classes, like Josh's. Earlier this month, he and his classmates
boarded a bus for the half-hour drive to the Long Trail on Jay Peak.
   Up on the trail, the youngsters fanned out to pick a tree.
Ten-year-old Rebecca Jenness sat in the snow in front of her tree, a
gray birch with roots raised to form a hole above the soil.
   ``What does it look like?'' Westin asked.
   ``A troll's house,'' Rebecca answered.
   ``Oh, beautiful,'' he said in praise.
   Rebecca said the project helps her learn in a way that's more
enjoyable than sitting at a desk.
   ``You learn about nature,'' agreed classmate Shannon Castl.
   Hartman said the projects help develop an interest in the
outdoors. ``I don't think it's going to turn them all into
environmentalists, and that's not our goal. But I would like them to
be at least as aware as they are of video games or what's going on
in sports.''

<HEAD>North Korea Announces Reshuffle Of Prominent Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   North Korea's premier was relieved of his position
today for health reasons and resigned from the ruling Politburo, the
country's official news agency said.
   The Korean Central News Agency report, monitored in Tokyo, said
Premier Li Gun Mo will be replaced by Yon Hyong Muk, a Politburo
member and secretary of the Korean Workers' (Communist) Party.
   It said the changes were approved at an extraordinary session of
the Supreme People's Assembly.
   Li had been premier since Dec. 29, 1986. Little is known about
him.
   On Saturday, KCNA reported that the communist party's 15-member
standing committee had requested an extraordinary meeting of the
assembly. That prompted speculation the party could have important
decisions to be approved by the congress.
   Another official report, from Radio Pyongyang, said a son of
party leader Kim Il Sung, Kim Pyong Il, was appointed ambassador to
Bulgaria.
   Kim Pyong Il became ambassador to Hungary in August but returned
to North Korea in September to protest Hungary's agreement with
South Korea to exchange permanent trade offices in their capital
cities.
   Kim Pyong Il was director-general of North Korea's People's Armed
Forces Bureau prior to his appointment as ambassador to Hungary.
   The appointment of a new ambassador to Hungary was not announced,
according to Radio Press, a Japanese news agency that monitors
communist bloc broadcasts.
   North Korea is believed to have downgraded its relations with
Hungary to one requiring the exchange of deputy ambassadors, Radio
Press said.
   The Supreme People's Assembly also approved the appointment of
Han Song Ryong to replace Yong Hyong Muk as secretary of the party's
central committee, KCNA said.
   Hyon Jun Guk was appointed editor-in-chief of the official
newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, a position formerly held by Chu Chang
Jun. Chu Gyo Chang, a central committee member, was appointed to
Hyon's position as head of the party's international department.
   The assembly meeting came at a time when some of communist North
Korea's closest allies are improving their ties with South Korea.
   Since the Summer Olympics in South Korea, the Soviet Union and
China have increased their economic and cultural contacts with the
capitalist South. Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria and the
Soviet Union have agreed to exchange trade offices with South Korea.
   The two Koreas were divided in 1945 after World War II when U.S.
and Soviet troops ended the Japanese occupation of Korea.

   Italian vintner Carlo Apollonio created the awards in 1972
honoring career achievement in memory of the late Italian-born
silent-film actor and to foster better relation between Italy and
Hollywood.
   Dunaway, 47, has starred in such films as ``Chinatown,'' ``The
Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Little Big Man,'' ``Three Days of the
Condor,'' ``The Champ,'' ``The Three Musketeers'' and ``Barfly.''
   Stallone, 42, also has appeared in ``The Lords of Flatbush,''
``F.I.S.T.,'' ``Paradise Alley'' and ``Death Race 2000.''

<HEAD>Former Philippine President to Undergo More Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deposed Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos
faces more medical tests after being hospitalized for what his aides
have called congestive heart failure.
   Marcos, 71, remained in guarded but stable condition late Sunday
at St. Francis Medical Center, according to nursing supervisor
Mildred Kim.
   Marcos, who contends he is too ill to travel to New York for
arraignment on federal racketeering charges, was admitted to the
hospital Friday.
   Aides said Marcos suffered congestive heart failure after
learning his eldest daughter, Imee Manotoc, was experiencing
complications during childbirth in Morocco, where she lives.
   Cardiologist Dr. Calvin Wong said Marcos would remain in the
hospital ``for a few days'' while additional tests are performed.
More tests were scheduled for today, he said.
   Tests have established that Marcos has weakened heart muscles _
or cardiomyopathy, Wong said, adding that victims of the condition
``are prone to develop congestive heart failure.''
   Wong, however, declined to say whether Marcos had suffered
congestive heart failure, when the heart is not strong enough to
pump a sufficient amount of blood. He also would not elaborate on
the nature of the tests scheduled for today.
   ``It's not just because this is the former president of the
Philippines,'' Wong said. ``Any of my patients, I would answer in
the same noncommittal way.''

   A Cuban exile tricked into thinking he had diverted
a jet with 128 people to Havana faces extradition from Grand Turk
for only the second hijacking attempt of a domestic U.S. airliner in
2{ years, officials said.
   Weary but unharmed, the 121 passengers and seven crew members
aboard the TWA Boeing 727 flight from San Juan arrived in Miami on
Sunday evening. They said the hijacker was not violent and was
shocked when he was arrested on Grand Turk, part of the British
colony of Turks and Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas.
   ``He was horrified to realize he had been tricked,'' said
passenger Willie Douglas of Montgomery, Ala.
   Robert Blattner, a spokesman at TWA headquarters in St. Louis,
identified the would-be hijacker as Felix Sanchez Rodriguez, 26, who
left Cuba during the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   Larry Torrence of the FBI's Miami office said the suspect
remained in Grand Turk and extradition proceedings were scheduled to
begin today. A device that Rodriguez claimed to be a bomb proved to
be harmless, officials said.
   Blattner said Rodriguez apparently wanted to return to Cuba to
see his ailing mother.
   ``A couple of times he leaned over some people and told them
everything's going to be all right,'' said passenger Tom Patri.
   The pilot of the Flight 469 was able to get permission to land on
Grand Turk island where police were able to convince Rodriguez he
was in Havana, Miller said.
   Luis Carlos Motta of Cali, Colombia, who acted as an interpreter
during the hijacking, said Rodriguez tapped him on the shoulder and
gave him a letter that said in red ink ``This is a hijacking.'' He
told Motta he had a bomb and said it would be activated by his watch.
   ``He said `I want to stay in Cuba. Please tell the captain, we go
to Cuba,'' according to Motta. Motta said the man was very nervous,
and that the plane banked to land on the first island it approached.
   ``As they landed he saw a fire engine (and several cars) and said
`Really, we are not in Cuba. I know the cars in Cuba,''' Motta said.
   The pilot and the interpreter convinced him that a civilian would
have to greet him, and when he left the plane he was arrested, Motta
said.
   It was the first hijacking of a domestic U.S. flight since May 3,
1986, when a man hijacked a Horizon Air commuter jet with 11 other
passengers and two crewmembers en route to Medford, Ore., and
demanded to go to Phoenix. The plane landed at Hillsboro, Ore., and
the hijacker was arrested.
   Hijackings to Cuba were common in the late 1960s and early '70s,
prompting the security measures now commonplace at airports. The
only previous hijacking involving a U.S. commercial flight this year
occurred in October, when three soldiers in Haiti stormed aboard an
American Airlines jetliner for New York during a period of political
turmoil in their country.
   On May 25, a flight mechanic without a pilot's license stole a
private jet in Newport News, Va., and took it on a 1,600-mile
joyride to Denver, where he shot himself as authorities closed in.

   Strewn throughout the charred, water-soaked
debris of what hours before had been a thriving street market were
the fireworks that set the market and five buildings ablaze.
   It happened Sunday, the eve of the Day of Virgin of Guadalupe.
One of the ways Mexicans honor their patron saint is by shooting
skyrockets, Roman candles and other fireworks. They keep firing them
sporadically through New Year's.
   Though barred by a little-enforced law, fireworks abound in
markets like that on Corona Street, especially during national and
religious holidays.
   A woman of about 60 said authorities have sometimes confiscated
the fireworks.
   ``This year there was nobody. Nobody came to take the fireworks
away,'' she said. ``The street was completely full of fireworks. It
was full of people. The Day of Guadalupe. So many dead. My God.''
   Authorities early today didn't know what ignited the fireworks,
triggering the series of explosions and fire that killed at least 70
people.
   Some witnesses said a spilled gas tank was to blame, others a
carelessly tossed cigarette. But the fire scarred both sides of
Corona Street, whipping through the well-known Candy Market, an
apartment building, two other structures containing apartments and
shops, and yet another where fireworks were stored and sold.
   ``All these people, it took away part of their lives,'' said
Marcel Guera, who has a market stall and ran to the scene after the
first explosion. ``They lost everything, and they live from one day
to the next.''
   Red Cross rescue worker Antonio Guayaberra said 22 of the victims
died in one structure next to the apartment building.
   ``Most of those found dead there were huddled together. Burned,''
he said.
   Many of them were on upper floors and apparently had shut
themselves inside the building to escape the flames, dense curtain
of smoke and popping fireworks outside, Guayaberra said.
   The smoke lifted to reveal the remnants of a bustling marketplace.
   A child's pail lay on its side in the muck; nearby, a pair of
women's shoes. On a table sat blackened soot in the classic pyramid
shape that fruit sellers use. Red, yellow and blue berries and the
candy Corona street was known for were scattered about. Red and
silver Christmas rope draped across the remains of a food stand.
   Dozens of gasoline cans, like those used to cook tacos and other
typical Mexican fare at open-air stands, littered the street.
   And everywhere, in the grime of Corona street and an adjacent
alleyway, were Chinese firecrackers, skyrockets and Roman candles.

<HEAD>Mayor Announces Candidacy For 2-Year Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK PERKISS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer launched a bid to stay in
office, saying he had ``kept our city together'' in troubled times
after the death of Mayor Harold Washington.
   Sawyer announced his candidacy Sunday for next year's special
election as a new poll showed him trailing Cook County State's
Attorney Richard M. Daley in a one-on-one race for the Democratic
nomination.
   ``I look forward to the contest. I know it won't be easy,''
Sawyer told about 700 supporters at a rally at a downtown hotel. ``I
need your help and your hard work and your prayers.''
   Sawyer, 54, enters a field of six other candidates who have
announced they are vying for his job. The election will be for a
two-year term, the remainder of Washington's second four-year term.
   ``In the past 12 months, I have been on the firing line day in an
day out,'' he told his supporters. ``I've taken some shots, fairly
and unfairly, but I have kept our city together and we've made great
progress through some very difficult times.''
   Sawyer was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen during a
raucous City Council meeting last December after Washington, the
city's first black mayor, died of a heart attack.
   The new mayoral poll, published in Sunday's Chicago Tribune,
showed Daley beating Sawyer by a margin of 59 percent to 30 percent.
Daley is the son of legendary Mayor Richard J. Daley, who ruled
Chicago for more than 20 years until his death in 1976.
   The telephone survey of 1,038 registered Chicago voters showed
Daley beating Alderman Timothy Evans, Sawyer's chief rival for the
support of black voters, by a 56-34 margin. Sawyer and Evans are
black.
   Jesse Jackson would give Daley the toughest opposition in the
mayoral race, garnering 40 percent to Daley's 52 percent, according
to the poll, which was conducted Dec. 2-5 and has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Jackson on Saturday said he was not a candidate.
   Political analysts said the survey was very early and did not
mean much.
   ``I don't put much stock in December polls when the election is
the last day of February, said Paul Green, a professor of political
science at Governors State University in suburban University Park.
   Last month, the Illinois Supreme Court set April 4 as the date
for a special election. The Democratic primary is scheduled for Feb.
28.
   Green said Sawyer has between $2 million and $3 million in a
campaign war chest. ``He's got a large kitty, so obviously he's
going to be able to get his message across,'' the analyst said.
   The Democratic primary has generally been tantamount to winning
the general election in Chicago's recent history. But that changed
somewhat in 1983 when a white Republican candidate made a strong
showing in a losing effort against Washington.
   The other announced Democratic candidates are Aldermen Lawrence
Bloom, Edward Burke and Danny Davis and former state Sen. James
Taylor.
   Former Chicago Parks Superintendent Edmund Kelly withdrew from
the Democratic field the day after Daley announced his candidacy and
the Chicago Sun-Times on Sunday said Burke also quit the race.
   Edward Howlett, son of a former Democratic secretary of state, is
the only announced GOP candidate.

<HEAD>Frigid Air Hits Great Lakes States, Northeast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An arctic air mass plunged temperatures below zero in the Great
Lakes states and the Northeast today, setting record lows in parts
of New York state.
   Readings were below zero this morning in northern New England,
much of New York state, Michigan and Minnesota, and only in the
single digits in eastern Minnesota, southern parts of the Great
Lakes, the northern Ohio Valley and southern New England.
   Record lows for today's date were set in Albany, N.Y. minus 7;
Binghamton, N.Y., minus 7; and Buffalo, N.Y., minus 5.
   The nation's high Sunday was 83 degrees in the Florida cities of
Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.
   A weather system moving across the southern Plains was bringing
snow to eastern Oklahoma, where 1 to 2 inches were expected, and
Arkansas, where 2 to 4 inches were possible.
   A developing low pressure system off the Carolina coast may bring
winter weather there late tonight. Winter storm watches were posted
for tonight and Tuesday for eastern North Carolina and all of South
Carolina.
   Showers continued in the Florida peninsula, but were much weaker
than the Sunday thunderstorms that produced strong winds. The gusts
caused window damage and flipped over a boat in a yard at St.
Petersburg, and uprooted trees near Sarasota. A tornado damaged the
roofs of 15 homes at Treasure Island.
   Today's forecast called for snow showers in upper Michigan,
Wisconsin and northeast Minnesota; scattered rain in northwest
Montana and along the northern Pacific coast; rain and occasional
thunderstorms from eastern South Carolina across southern Georgia
and Florida.
   Temperatures were to be 15 or more degrees below normal for
mid-December from New England and the lower Great Lakes across the
central Gulf of Mexico coast and northern Florida. Montana was to
have temperatures up to 25 degrees higher than normal for the season.
   Predicted highs: single digits and teens in New England, inland
New York state and upper Michigan; 20s and 30s from Pennsylvania
across the Carolinas, from northern parts of the central Gulf of
Mexico states across the rest of the Great Lakes, the upper
two-thirds of the Mississippi Valley, the central Missouri Valley
and North Dakota; 60s in central Florida to near 80 across southern
Florida; 60s in southern Texas; 50s in western and central Montana;
60s and 70s from central and Southern California across southern
Arizona.
   The rest of the nation generally should reach the 40s and 50s.
   The nation's temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from minus 17
degrees at Niagara Falls, N.Y., to 76 at Key West (Fla.) Naval Air
Station.

<HEAD>Prominent Union Leader Given Bail After 900 Days In Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unexpected move, a court
today granted bail to a prominent union leader and four other black
activists held for up to 30 months while on trial for treason.
   The Johannesburg Supreme Court granted bail to Moses Mayekiso,
head of the country's largest metalworkers union, and four
co-defendants charged with attempting a political takeover of
Alexandra, an inpoverished black township adjoining Johannesburg.
   Mayekiso was released on bail of 10,000 rand, or $4,200. The
others each paid $2,100. Four of the men, including Mayekiso, spent
more than 900 days in custody, while the fifth had been held almost
700 days.
   The case was adjourned last month and is to resume in February.
   The trial has attracted international attention due to Mayekiso's
position as general secretary of the National Union of Metalworkers
of South Africa and because many activists view the prosecution as
an attempt to stifle peaceful anti-apartheid activity.
   Conditions of bail bar the defendants from entering Alexandra,
addressing meetings or granting press interviews.
   The government alleges that the defendants organized rent and
consumer boycotts and sought to undermine the security forces in
1985 and 1986, the height of nationwide black unrest.
   Alexandra was one of the most militant townships at the time, and
dozens of people were killed in clashes with security forces.
   In several recent court cases, authorities have taken actions
designed to give the appearance of leniency toward anti-apartheid
activists.
   Last week, a judge in Pretoria sentenced four prominent activists
to prison terms of six to 12 years following their conviction on
treason in a three-year trial. Most observers expected the sentences
to be much harsher.
   In November, President P.W. Botha granted clemency to the
Sharpeville Six, a group of blacks convicted of murder in the mob
killing of a black township councilor. Their deaths sentences
provoked an international outcry, and Botha decided to give them
lengthy prison sentences instead.
   In the past two years, the government has sought to restore
control by detaining or restricting leaders of Mayekiso's Alexandra
Action Committee while undertaking a $38 million development program
in the township.
   Alexandra, wedged between affluent white suburbs, is one of the
country's most squalid urban townships. Many of the 120,000
residents lack electricity and toilets, and water comes from
communal taps.

   Israeli soldiers killed two guerrillas before
dawn today in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in southern
Lebanon, a military spokesman said.
   No Israeli troops were hurt in the clash, the spokesman said.
   Troops opened fire after encountering the guerrillas during a
routine patrol in the central sector of the 6-to-10-mile-wide
security zone near the village Barachit, the army said.
   The guerrillas were heavily armed with submachine guns, hand
grenades and rocket-propelled grenades, the army said. Israel army
radio said they were probably planning to attack an Israeli target
within the security belt.
   It was the third clash between soldiers and guerrillas in the
last 2{ weeks. Two guerrillas were killed in two separate firefights
on Nov. 27 and Nov. 30.
   Israel carved out the security zone in 1985 when it pulled the
bulk of its troops out of Lebanon three years after invading the
nation. The border strip, designed to curb guerrilla raids into
Israel, is patrolled by hundreds of Israeli troops and the South
Lebanon Army, a mostly Christian militia of 1,500 men trained and
equipped by Israel.

   Gunmen using silencer-equipped pistols
shot and killed a Belgian teacher in Moslem west Beirut today,
police said.
   They identified the victim as Arthur Van Niewerburgh, an English
teacher at west Beirut's Rashideen School of Languages.
   Niewerburgh, 65, was walking from school to his home in the
Manara district when he was shot by gunmen in a speeding car at 11
a.m., police said.
   ``Four bullets pierced his head. Death was instantaneous,'' said
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   He said witnesses told police they saw three gunmen in the orange
Volvo used in the assassination. The car did not have licence
plates, police said.
   Niewerburgh's body was still lying in a pool of blood on a Manara
sidewalk two hours after the shooting as police interrogated
witnesses.
   His head was covered with a blood-soaked towel.
   Niewerburgh is survived by a Japanese wife and a 15-year-old son,
Christian.
   His wife, whose name was not immediately available, was abroad on
vacation. She owns the Tokyo Restaurant in west Beirut, police said.

<HEAD>Actor Castellano Dies Unexpectedly Of Heart Failure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTH BERGEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Richard Castellano, nominated for
an Oscar and a Tony for his role in ``Lovers and Other Strangers,''
has died of heart failure. He was 55.
   Among his best-known roles were his portrayal of Mafia lieutenant
Clemenza in the film ``The Godfather'' and his part as co-star in
the television series ``The Super.''
   The New York City native, who died Saturday at his North Bergen,
N.J., home, gained an Academy Award nomination for best supporting
actor in 1970 for his role in the film ``Lovers and Other
Strangers.'' He was nominated for a Tony for the same role in the
theatrical version of the work in 1968.
   He also appeared on Broadway in Peter Weiss' ``The
Investigation,'' Frank Gilroy's ``That Summer, That Fall,'' and in
Art Buchwald's ``Sheep on the Runway.''
   A statement issued Sunday by his wife, actress and writer Ardell
Sheridan, 45, said the couple had been working on a book titled
``History of the Method,'' which chronicles the genesis of method
acting.
   ``It mas Mr. Castellano's dream to pass on his acting legacy to
aspiring actors, writers and directors in an easily understood and
applied formula,'' Mrs. Sheridan said.
   She said she planned to continue her husband's work.
   Castellano also is survived by his daughter, Margaret Castellano
Moller, his sister and an aunt.
   Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday in North Bergen.

<HEAD>Teen-ager Says Parents Taught Her To Use Cocaine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a teen-age girl were
arrested after she told authorities they taught her how to use
cocaine and how to cook it into the highly addictive drug ``crack.''
   Victor P. Hupman, 36, and his wife, Patricia, 34, were free on
bail Sunday. Their five children, ranging in age from 6 to 17, were
placed in the custody of grandparents.
   Hupman told authorities he figured his 17-year-old daughter,
Stephanie, would be exposed to cocaine and ``he wanted her to be
exposed to it at home,'' police Lt. Steve Gray said.
   The Hupmans were arrested after Stephanie told a school counselor
they had a drug problem and were openly using cocaine, police said.
The two were booked on four counts of furnishing cocaine to a minor
and released on $25,000 bail Saturday night.
   Miss Hupman told authorities she used cocaine four times, two of
those times in the form of crack, he said.
   The teen-ager said she saw her parents use cocaine for the first
time in the summer of 1986. Several months ago, she began asking
questions about the drug's effects and if she could try it, said
police officer Chris Lindholm.
   ``He said, `Here. Have some,''' Lindholm said about the father's
reaction.
   At first, Miss Hupman was disturbed by the police intervention
with the family, but state child abuse laws require school officials
to inform police when they receive such a report, Lindholm said.
   ``Her initial reasoning was not to throw them in jail or anything
but to get help for her or them,'' he said. ``She was worried the
family might crack up and her parents might die.''
   Hupman is a printer at Stanford University, and his wife works
there as a patient relations specialist.
   Mountain View is about 35 miles south of San Francisco.

<HEAD>Hampton Loses Bidding War, Buys Painting Anyway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jazz musician Lionel Hampton got into a bidding
war he didn't want _ and had to lose in order to win.
   Hampton, 74, was enjoying some jazz at a benefit art auction
given Sunday by the New York-based Arts and Entertainment Alliance.
   The Alliance was honoring six artists, including Hampton, the
late collage artist Romare Bearden and theatrical producer Vy
Higginsen.
   Hampton is a fan of Higginsen, whose ``Mama, I Want to Sing'' has
been billed as the longest running off-Broadway play produced by a
black.
   ``I was in her lobby and said she needs some pictures in here,''
Hampton recalled. So when the signature acrylic painting ``Piano
Man'' by Bearden protege Verna Hart came up for bid, Hampton was
ready.
   ``I'm going to get this picture for Vy,'' he thought.
   But Higginsen began bidding for ``Piano Man'' too. The price went
up and up, until Higginsen won at $2,500.
   Higginsen was elated at winning, but even more so a few minutes
later, when the auctioneer told her Hampton would pay for the
painting.
   ``That was the least I could do,'' Hampton said, adding that the
former magazine publisher had helped many black artists over the
years.
   ``I was absolutely thrilled. I was very interested in that
painting,'' Higginsen said.

   A Yugoslav military plane flying aid
to earthquake victims in Armenia crashed today while trying to land,
and all seven people on board were killed, the official Tanjug news
agency reported.
   The AN-12 cargo plane crashed about 10 miles from the airport at
Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, Tanjug said in a dispatch from
Moscow. It said the plane left the southern Yugoslav city of Skopje
late Sunday and that the crash occurred at 2:23 a.m. Moscow time.
   Local reporters said the pilot mistook a well-lit highway for a
runway.
   The Soviet-built aircraft crashed in front of a bridge and
practically fell into pieces, Tanjug said. There were no survivors,
the news agency reported. Seven crew members were said to be aboard.
   On Sunday, a Soviet plane carrying relief aid to the republic
crashed, and 78 people died.
   Tanjug said the Yugoslav plane was carrying medical equipment and
other supplies to Armenia, where at least 50,000 people were killed
and 500,000 left homeless by last Wednesday's earthquake.
   Tanjug said the cause of the crash was not known.

   Hunters found the skeletal remains of a
sixth woman in woods near this old fishing port, and authorities
said they had developed a list of suspects in the slayings.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina says at least five
murders were likely committed by the same killer or killers. At
least three victims were known to have ties to a seedy area known
for prostitution and drug sales.
   ``We have a list of potential suspects. There are people who are
known to do things like this and there are people who are giving us
some information,'' Pina said Sunday in a news conference at the
site where the sixth body was found.
   Nearby, police were still collecting parts of the badly
decomposed female body from a gravel pit in the wooded area near
Interstate 195.
   Douglas Ubelaker, an expert on forensics from the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C., was scheduled to perform an autopsy
today on the body.
   The skeletal remains, found Saturday afternoon, were the sixth
female body found since July in a six- to eight-mile square area
outside this town of 98,000 people in southeastern Massachusetts.
   The latest victim, who remained unidentified, could not
definitely be linked to the other five, Pina said. The woman was
``very similar'' to the others in that she was partially clad, he
said.
   The sixth body appeared to have been in the woods longer than any
of the others, possibly since spring, Pina said.
   ``This is the first one that wasn't found on the side of the
highway,'' State Trooper Thomas Medeiros said. ``But this one isn't
far from the highway.''

<HEAD>Labor, Likud Tussle Over Guidelines For Joint Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Labor Party and the Likud bloc renewed
negotiations today on forming a joint government, and officials said
a major point of conflict involved right-wing plans to build 40
Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud and Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres of the left-leaning Labor ordered talks
restarted Sunday night after a 10-day lull.
   The party chiefs set up three-member negotiating teams to
finalize a coalition agreement that would bring the country's two
largest political blocs back into a broad-based government.
   Israel radio said the two teams met in secret locations today and
focused on guidelines for a new government. The radio said there was
growing pressure for Peres to become finance minister, a less
prestigious post than his current position as foreign minister.
   The radio said the negotiators agreed to continue the 10-member
Inner Cabinet with equal representation from both parties. The body
decides major security and foreign policy issues.
   The liberal daily Haaretz said today the two parties have agreed
to set a timetable for dealing with electoral reform, which appeared
aimed at reducing the influence of small religious parties that
currently hold the balance of power.
   Shamir has been trying to forge a government since Likud won a
slight edge over Labor, 40 seats to 39, in the Nov. 1 election for
the 120-member parliament.
   In an apparent effort to avoid making concessions on religious
and political issues _ some of which deeply angered American Jews _
Shamir turned back to Labor after appearing close to an agreement
with small religious and nationalist parties.
   Likud's talks with the small parties continue, however, and
officials close to Shamir did not rule out the small parties joining
whatever government is formed.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a Shamir adviser, expressed the hope that talks
with Labor could be wrapped up in two or three days. But a Peres
aide who demanded anonymity predicted negotiations would go down to
the Dec. 26 deadline, when Shamir must present a new government.
   Ahimeir said the policy guidelines should be substantially the
same as those laid down for the current coalition government, which
was formed after stalemated elections in 1984.
   ``Some adjustments and additions are needed. For example, we
insist that more emphasis be given to building new Jewish villages
(in the West Bank and Gaza) as economic conditions allow,'' he said.
   However, Ahimeir said Shamir did not favor unlimited settlement
building. He indicated that if Labor joined the government, Likud
would not be obligated to carry out an agreement with Tehiya, a
pro-settlement party, to build 40 new settlements.
   An official close to Peres said Likud would have to break its
agreement with Tehiya. ``If Likud doesn't break the promise, there
is no way Labor can enter,'' he said.
   There are more than 130 Jewish settlements with about 70,000 Jews
living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war. They are surrounded by 1.5 million
Palestinians.
   Ahimeir said Likud wanted to preserve existing policy guidelines
on the peace issue. Shamir demands direct talks between Israel and
the Arabs, whereas Peres supports an international conference as an
opening for those talks.
   An official close to Peres indicated one way to bridge the gap
might be to propose talks under joint Soviet-American sponsorship.
   ``The attitude towards the Soviets is different today, so maybe
this will help,'' he said.
   Shamir also will insist that any new policy initiatives be
cleared in advance with the prime minister. But Israeli newspapers
indicated Labor wanted freedom of maneuver to explore peace options
and other political policy issues.
   Labor officials indicated they would insist on the right to vote
against religious legislation such as the so-called ``who is a Jew''
bill, which proposes giving Israel's Orthodox rabbinate final say
over the sensitive issue of conversions.

<HEAD>Walesa Says Poland Should Hasten Reforms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said today his
outlawed trade union is ready for talks on reforming the Polish
system and strikes should be a last resort.
   The Nobel Peace Prize winner spoke before returning home from his
first trip abroad since martial law was imposed in Poland in 1981.
By allowing him to travel, authorities gave implicit recognition of
Walesa's importance as a public figure.
   President Francois Mitterrand invited Walesa to attend ceremonies
Saturday marking the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.
   ``There is a (reform) process that we want to speed up and the
fact that we are here is evidence of a quickening,'' said Walesa.
   On Nov. 30, Walesa debated the chief of Poland's communist-backed
official union in a live broadcast on national television. The
uncensored debate was the first time since 1983 that the Solidarity
leader has appeared on Polish television.
   Walesa said the Polish ``system is moving in a good direction.
But it is going by foot while the rest of the world is going by car.
It is necessary to accelerate the process.''
   ``Poland needs peace and pluralism. There is a place for both
(Prime Minister Mieczyslaw) Rakowski and Solidarity,'' he said.
   Walesa said he continued to favor negotiations to include the
government, church and opposition.
   The government offered to hold the talks following two waves of
strikes this year. But the talks reached an impasse after the
government refused to legalize the banned union and Solidarity
demanded a signal the government would consider the legalization
before it would enter talks.
   He said the discussion was still necessary. ``My union has wanted
it for a long time. But we should be considered free and
independent. Under this condition we are ready right away,'' he said.
   ``Poland doesn't need any more strikes now, because strikes are a
last resort,'' Walesa said.
   He said the union ``should struggle to get the most we can for
ourselves. But we also should remember to behave like good
microorganisms and not destroy the system that we live in.''
   During his visit, the smiling and ebullient Walesa met Soviet
dissident physicist Andrei Sakharov for the first time.
   The men, both Nobel laureates and leading dissidents, exchanged
impressions of the fight for human rights in Poland and the Soviet
Union. Walesa said today he hoped to maintain contact with Sakharov.
   ``He's a great thinker and a great, great man. But I don't know
what the possibilities will be for keeping in touch.''
   Solidarity adviser Bronsilaw Gemerek said Walesa earlier in the
day was at the departure of a truck loaded with supplies for victims
of the Armenian earthquake. He said Walesa sent a letter on the
truck to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``to express his
Solidarity with the Soviet people.''

<TEXT>
   A quiet candlelight vigil by ``skinheads''
capped a day of demonstration and counterdemonstration by white
supremacists and those who oppose their racist beliefs.
   The vigil Saturday night at South Whidbey State Park marked the
slaying four years ago of white supremacist Robert J. Mathews. The
31-year-old founder of The Order died in a shootout with FBI
officers at a cabin near the park.
   Earlier Saturday, about 225 people chanted slogans and waved
signs in a parking lot in this Whidbey Island town, about 60 miles
northwest of Seattle. State police troopers and sheriff's deputies
kept the two groups apart, and there were no violent incidents or
arrests.
   A 17-year-old youth wearing a swastika button who wandered up to
the crowd was surrounded by 30-40 people, who shouted ``Scum go
home.'' Officers and protest organizers cooled things down, and the
youth was escorted away by a park ranger.
   The counterdemonstrators included union members, civil rights
activists, students, gay-rights activists and members of the Seattle
chapter of the Guardian Angels.
   They shouted slogans like ``We beat the fear by being here'' and
``Hey hey, ho ho, Nazi bigots got to go.''
   The Rev. Richard Butler, head of the Church of Jesus Christ
Christian (Aryan Nations), arrived shortly after most of the
counterdemonstrators left, followed shortly by Tom Metzger, founder
of White Aryan Resistance, based in Fallbrook, Calif.
   The vigil was organized largely by Metzger's son, John Metzger,
leader of White Aryan Resistance Youth.
   Those arriving for the vigil gave Nazi-like salutes, called
reporters ``scumbags'' and ``leeches,'' and hurled profanities at a
photographer of Japanese ancestry.
   Karl Herler of San Francisco brought his daughters, Kristina, 12,
and Eva, 10, for the memorial service.
   ``The skinheads, who everybody has this nightmare image of, it's
incredible how intelligent and knowledgeable they are, compared with
most people their age,'' he said.
   His younger daughter said she hoped to become a skinhead when she
got older, although women are not accepted as full-fledged members
of the movement.
   Skinheads, generally young, favor close-cropped hair,
military-style clothing and tattoos. Many are associated with the
white supremacist Aryan Youth Movement and White Aryan Resistance,
and have adopted Nazi beliefs.
   ``I'd die for my beliefs, so the least I could do is cut my
hair,'' Eva Herler said.
   About 60 people attended the vigil, said Jim Collins, state parks
assistant regional supervisor. He said law enforcement officers were
present but did not approach the group's campsite, and reporters and
others were kept away.
   After Mathews' death, 22 Order members were indicted on
racketeering charges stemming from murders, arson, counterfeiting
and armed robberies that netted more than $4 million to finance
their operations, authorities said.
   Ten were convicted in December 1985, and 12 others pleaded
guilty. Many were former members of Aryan Nations.

   An 11-year-old boy standing near the Christmas
tree in his living room was killed when a stray bullet apparently
fired by gang members crashed through a window and struck him in the
back, police said today.
   The boy's death Sunday was the second blamed on gangs during the
weekend; a 21-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant died
Saturday after being shot in the head and abdomen. Tammy Harris'
fetus did not survive.
   Authorities were seeking three assailants who drove by the boy's
home in a large car in the community of Willowbrook, 12 miles south
of downtown, sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez said.
   The shooting ``definitely was gang-related, but we do not feel
that this house or this boy was the subject of the shooting,''
sheriff's Sgt. Frank Salerno said.
   The boy, identified as David Polion, was with his mother and
other family members inside their house, about 100 yards from the
shooting scene, when the bullet came through the front window,
Deputy Chris Wahla said.
   ``They heard a number of shots ring out. One of the shots hit him
in the back,'' Wahla said, adding the bullet was believed to be a
stray shot not intended for the house.
   The child's mother, Cynthia Johnson, was ironing her son's
clothes for school when the bullet came through the window past a
recently decorated Christmas tree, said the boy's stepfather,
Vernell Davis, who said he was sleeping at the time of the attack.
   ``We were in the living room dancing,'' said the boy's cousin,
Shikita Roberson. ``He was standing up. We heard a shot. And he ran
to the kitchen and collapsed and began crawling.''
   It was unknown how many shots struck the house. Witnesses said
they heard eight to nine shots fired, Wahla said.

fighting weight in the 3rd graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Robin Givens says Mike Tyson has
ballooned to 255 pounds and doesn't plan to defend his heavyweight
title against Britain's Frank Bruno despite continuing negotiations
for the repeatedly postponed fight.
   In an interview in this week's People magazine, Ms. Givens said
Tyson told her in a recent late-night phone call that ``he was up to
255 pounds. He said, `I'm not going to fight anymore. I'm going to
spend all my money, all my time, all my energy fighting you.' I told
him that he has no fight with me.''
   Tyson's manager, Bill Cayton, is trying to arrange a Feb. 25 bout
in Las Vegas for the boxer, whose fighting weight is in the 220s.
   Ms. Givens and Tyson have sued each other for divorce. The
actress also has filed a $125 million libel suit against Tyson after
he accused her and her mother, Ruth Roper, of trying to steal his
money and called them ``the slime of the slime'' in a newspaper
interview.
   But Ms. Givens told People: ``I have no interest in the money.
None. It will all go to charity. I just don't want him to talk about
me that way.''
   Ms. Givens said her reputation as a conniving gold digger who
married Tyson for his money is undeserved.
   ``I'm one of the nicest, most fair people I know, especially
recently,'' she said.

<HEAD>Court to Study University Tenure Issue in University of
Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case capturing the
attention of some leading universities, agreed today to study a
university's attempt to withhold confidential information from a
faculty member who says her denial of tenure was due to illegal
discrimination.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by University of
Pennsylvania officials accused of discriminating against a Chinese
woman denied promotion to full professor.
   But the justices indicated that they will be studying a very
narrow issue in the case _ one dealing with which trial court had
the authority to hear it.
   The university's appeal was supported by Princeton, Brown,
Stanford, Harvard and Yale. Lawyers for the other schools said that
forcing universities to reveal confidential statements about those
being considered for professorships will inhibit candor by those who
evaluate tenure candidates.
   The case began with a complaint by Rosalie Tung, an associate
professor of management at Penn, after she was denied tenure at the
university's Wharton School.
   Tenure is a lifetime appointment to the faculty.
   Ms. Tung filed a complaint with the federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission charging she was the victim of discrimination
against women and people of Asian race.
   The commission subpoenaed the university's confidential peer
review records for Ms. Tung and five other male candidates
considered for tenure.
   The university refused to provide the documents. It said
confidentiality is vital to the tenure review process, which in turn
is ``a critical component'' of the university's academic freedom
protected by the Constitution.
   University officials supported a balancing test, approved by
other federal appeals courts, that would allow the school to keep
the information secret unless it is shown to be essential to the
claim being made by the teacher denied tenure.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last June that the
university must not be allowed to shield possible discrimination
behind ``a wall of secrecy.''
   The appeals court said relevant information may not be concealed
from the commission. But the appeals court ordered further trial
court hearings to determine whether the university may be allowed to
delete from the peer review reports the names of professors who
evaluate tenure candidates.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to allow the
appeals court ruling to stand.
   Justice Department lawyers noted that the high court in 1986
declined to review the issue in a similar case. They said there is
no more reason now for the court to enter the dispute.
   The case is University of Pennsylvania vs. EEOC, 88-493.

   Residents of a town southwest of Tokyo got a double
surprise when a U.S. military helicopter made an emergency landing
with Santa Claus aboard.
   Police said today the Navy helicopter landed Sunday in a rice
paddy about 220 yards from an elementary school after an oil leak
was detected in the rotor.
   One of the four crew members emerged from the helicopter dressed
in a Santa Claus suit in hopes of surprising his family at nearby
Atsugi Naval Base, said the police officer in Isehara, 30 miles
southwest of Tokyo.
   ``(The crew member) said he boarded the helicopter in uniform and
changed while he was aboard,'' said the police official, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the helicopter was on a routine training flight and no
injuries or damage to the craft were reported. He refused to name
any of the helicopter crew members.

<TEXT>
   Investigators today cleared unexploded
fireworks from a marketplace where a chain reaction of blasts and
flames killed at least 70 people in stalls crowded with Christmas
shoppers.
   Forty-five people were injured in the explosions Sunday in the
congested street market, said Salvador Padillo, the Red Cross
commander. Most were quickly released from the hospital and none was
reported seriously injured.
   Red Cross spokesman Alfonso Manzo said early today that 70 bodies
had been found. At least 12 of the dead were children, officials
said.
   The last seven bodies were discovered shortly after 3 a.m. (4
a.m. EST) in a storeroom of illegal fireworks. Many of the other
dead were found in the rubble of candy vendors' stalls.
   ``It was a time bomb,'' said Elizabeth Diaz, a member of a union
of market vendors. ``There's hundreds of people who come here to
sell them (illegal fireworks), they have for years. Why didn't the
authorities come?''
   Authorities said they had not determined the cause of the
disaster, and witnesses disagreed on where the first explosion
occurred.
   But all said that after the first blast, explosions ripped like
machine-gun fire through stalls where vendors had been selling
skyrockets, Roman candles and other fireworks.
   ``At first it sounded like bullets. Then there were more and more
and then the explosion,'' said Fernando Dominguez, who was working
in a shoe store.
   Selling fireworks to the general public is barred in Mexico City,
but the law is widely ignored.
   The fire ripped through the congested market and five adjacent
buildings, which are half a mile from the Zocalo Plaza in the heart
of Mexico City.
   The area was crowded with shoppers buying food, looking for
Christmas presents and for fireworks to celebrate the Day of the
Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint, which is today.
   ``People were running out of the market and screaming,'' said
Oscar Cordero, 25, standing by the pile of debris that had been his
stand and stock of calculators and other electronic goods.
   The block on Corona Street was one of scores in the old downtown
where vendors set up tables in the street. It is one of the busiest
market areas in this city of 18 million and is most famous for the
Mercado de Dulces, or Candy Market, one of the buildings that was
partially burned.
   Many people died when they were trapped in buildings along the
street that caught fire. The fire spread to the five-story Candy
Market, an apartment building and three other buildings.
   After the fire was out, firefighters and sanitation workers used
dollies to remove dozens of crates of unexploded fireworks from the
area, and the work continued under floodlights through the night.
The street was strewn with spent firecrackers, charred wood and
comic books, twisted metal, tangles of high tension wires and glass
from shattered windows.
   Although illegal, fireworks are easily purchased and are a strong
tradition on the Day of Guadalupe, one of the country's biggest
religious holidays. They are heard sporadically in the city from
Dec. 12 through New Year's.
   ``Here's it's all clandestine,'' said Rutilo Ayala, a policeman
at the scene. ``They sell rockets and hide them under pastas, fruit
and whatever else they sell.''
   ``It's a case of corruption,'' said Angelica Peredo who lives
next to one of the buildings that burned.
   Residents and market vendors vented their anger at Mayor Manuel
Camacho Solis as he plodded through the water-soaked debris, a yard
deep in places.
   ``Many children died here, Mr. Mayor,'' said one man.
   The mayor, who took office Dec. 1, promised to look for a
solution to the problem.
   District Attorney Ignacio Morales Lechuga said fireworks are too
much of a tradition to do away with.
   ``This does not mean there is going to be an attack on Mexican
culture,'' he said. ``These things (fireworks) are part of Mexican
culture.''
   Everado Gamiz Fernandez, a municipal leader, admitted that
inspections in the market were not frequent and that there might be
2,000 fireworks vendors in his district.
   ``There aren't enough resources to inspect and watch here every
day and night,'' he said. ``They've always sold fireworks here.''

<HEAD>Clinics Swamped As Abortion Ban Goes Into Effect Monday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors and nurses worked double shifts over the
weekend as hundreds of poor women had abortions before a new state
ban on Medicaid funding for the procedure took effect today.
   It will be some time before the effect of the ban can be
evaluated, but some clinic operators say the measure, approved by
Michigan voters in the Nov. 8 election, won't decrease the number of
poor women having abortions.
   ``A lot of pro-lifers say this is going to hurt us, but I don't
think it will,'' said Dave Williams, a spokesman for Women's Health
Services of Detroit. ``I've had women tell me they've sold crack
(cocaine) to get the money. ... If they know they want to terminate
it, they'll get the money.''
   At Womancare clinics, which perform most of the Medicaid-funded
abortions in the state, doctors and nurses worked double shifts to
perform the operation during the weekend, owner Dr. Abraham Hodari
said.
   The clinics were prepared to perform 120 abortions Friday and
Saturday, about 50 percent more than the normal two-day total, he
said.
   Kim Evans, a woman answering calls at a Womancare office today,
was unable to say how many abortions were actually performed.
   Hodari said with the ban in effect, he would perform abortions
for $50 for Medicaid recipients.
   ``During the years I did this on Medicaid, I saved a lot of
money,'' he said. ``Now I want to help people with it.''
   Proponents of the ban said the state spent $6 million on Medicaid
abortions last year for about 18,000 poor women.
   Some forecasts show the state now will have to pay between $10
million and $50 million because of more Medicaid births and children
born into poverty, State Medicaid Director Kevin Seitz said.
   In states where Medicaid-funded abortions have ended, such as
Ohio and Georgia, studies show about 20 percent of Medicaid-eligible
women who carried pregnancies to term would probably have had
abortions had they been free.
   The cost to taxpayers for a Medicaid abortion averages $318 in
Michigan, state Medicaid administrator Esther Reagan said. The cost
for a Medicaid recipient who delivers a baby averages $3,100 for
health care and hospitalization.
   A 19-year-old who had an abortion Friday at the Womancare clinic
in Southfield said she would have terminated her pregnancy even
without Medicaid financing.
   ``I'd have found the money somewhere,'' said the woman, who
identified herself only as Lisa. ``I don't know where, though.''

<HEAD>Court Rules on Garbage-Privacy Issue in Nebraska Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, already having ruled that
privacy rights do not extend to garbage left at curbside for
pick-up, today refused to treat differently garbage discarded closer
to home.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a
convicted Fremont, Neb., man had no privacy right in garbage cans
left outside for collection four feet from his home's back door.
   Unlike the court's decision last May in a case from California,
today's order sets no national precedent.
   But it defeats Randall Trahan's challenge to his conviction for
possession of cocaine and gambling records and for promoting
gambling.
   Fremont police and Dodge County Sheriff's deputies, without
obtaining a court warrant, searched through the contents of garbage
left outside Trahan's trailer home and outside the tavern he and his
roommate owned.
   They found ``bet sheets'' used by bookmakers.
   Police previously had been tipped that Trahan was involved in
bookmaking.
   After obtaining a search warrant, law enforcement officers raided
Trahan's home. They found gambling materials and some cocaine inside.
   Trahan was sentenced to three years probation.
   The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld Trahan's conviction and
sentence last Sept. 2, rejecting arguments that the warrantless
search of the garbage left for collection on his property violated
his privacy rights.
   The nation's highest court voted 6-2 last May 16 in ruling that
police do not need a warrant before sifting through garbage left in
plastic bags at curbside.
   ``It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at
the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals,
children, scavengers, snoops or other members of the public,''
Justice Byron R. White wrote for the court then.
   ``The police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes
from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by
any member of the public,'' he said.
   The Nebraska court said Trahan's challenge must fail in light of
the May decision.
   ``Garbage left for collection at a designated location and
accessible to the public shall not be accorded constitutional
protection'' whether it is on or off someone's private property, the
state court ruled.
   The case is Trahan vs. Nebraska, 88-697.

<HEAD>Questions Raised About Charitable Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose annual Thanksgiving-eve dinners
for the elderly have attracted thousands of dollars in donations and
praise from President Reagan has been ordered by the state to halt
fund-raising.
   And The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that a detailed
examination raises questions about most aspects of her operation,
including her claims to feeding thousands, her record-keeping and
fund-raising.
   Minnie Bolds Moore has claimed to feed up to 25,000 people each
year. Far fewer than that showed up this year, and while she said
her charity was deep in debt, much of the food was donated.
   Moore gave inconsistent and sometimes contradictory answers while
defending the charity she heads, Concerned Parents Inc., its records
and the scope of the operation, the newspaper reported.
   Moore did not return phone messages left by The Associated Press.
   Moore was unable to say how much Concerned Parents Inc. has
raised or spent in recent years. She has kept no ledger. She has no
checking account. She makes most of her purchases with cash, she
told the newspaper.
   ``I'm just terrible with record-keeping and stuff like that,''
she explained, adding that she runs essentially a one-woman
operation.
   Concerned Parents Inc. has failed to file annual reports required
by state law and pay its $10 registration fee since 1986, according
to the Commission on Charitable Organizations, which regulates
charities' fund-raising.
   In March the commission ordered Concerned Parents to halt
fund-raising until it filed updated reports and renewed its
registration to operate as a charity.
   Moore told the Inquirer she complied with the letter almost
immediately, but commission officials said they have no reply from
Moore on file.
   Moore, 47, says her annual Thanksgiving-eve dinners began
modestly in 1968, when she invited elderly neighbors to share
Thanksgiving dinner with her family.
   It has gotten more publicity as it has grown. Publicity helped
the charity raise thousands of dollars from hundreds of givers _
Moore has two index-card file boxes filled with their names and
addresses. President Reagan has written a letter of praise.
   In interviews, Moore always stresses the financial and logistical
burden of feeding 25,000 people a dinner that includes turkey, ham,
roast beef, macaroni salad, sweet potatoes, collard greens and baked
beans.
   This year, as in the past, she said her menu would include 500
turkeys, 200 hams and 400 ``steamship rounds'' of roast beef.
   In fact, no turkey was served at the dinner _ although there were
450 chickens. There were only nine canned hams and a dozen rounds of
roast beef, according to a check of the kitchen that day at the
Civic Center site of the dinner and interviews with Army cooks who
volunteered to prepare the meal.
   There was still more than enough food because far fewer than
25,000 showed up for the dinner.
   In an interview the day of the dinner, Moore said she had raised
about $23,000 for this year's meal, but was $70,000 in debt. She
used identical figures in interviews before the 1987 dinner.
   Much of the food served this year was donated, according to local
corporations and Moore.
   ``The money that we have raised has never covered the cost of the
meal,'' Moore said. ``When we were doing it on our own, we were
always in the hole doing it. And we've been in the hole ever since.''
   Moore has two criminal convictions: one in 1968 for passing
worthless checks; another in 1979 for her part in a scheme to steal
$158,000 in emergency checks from the state Public Welfare
Department.
   She insisted that she got into trouble while trying to help
others.
   ``I have never done anything to benefit myself personally. When
they investigated it ... they found it was done to help others,''
she said.

<HEAD>Soviet Director Quits Royal Opera House In Wagner Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yuri Lyubimov, the maverick Soviet-born theater
director, has left the Royal Opera House after a dispute over his
staging of Richard Wagner's ``The Ring of the Nibelungs.''
   Jeremy Isaacs, general director of the opera house in London's
Covent Garden, said Sunday that the 70-year-old Russian had been
released from his contract.
   Isaacs said Lyubimov was leaving after ``intellectual differences
in artistic interpretation'' with the Royal Opera's Dutch-born music
director, Bernard Haitink. The collaboration could only have
proceeded if there was ``absolute confidence between them,'' Isaacs
said.
   ``The Ring'' is a German myth about power struggles among ancient
gods over a hoard of gold, and discord over how to present the work
is nothing new in the operatic world.
   Haitink, who doesn't like displays of temperament, clashed with
Lyubimov over the director's emotive staging ideas and dislike of
detailed advance planning.
   Lyubimov and Haitink argued interminably during rehearsals
earlier this year over the staging of the first part of the cycle,
``The Rhine Gold.''
   The opera opened Sept. 29 to general acclaim from critics and
public and every seat was sold for the six performances.
   But the crunch came over how ``The Valkyrie,'' the second part of
the four-opera ``Ring'' cycle, should be presented next year.
   ``They had very different ideas ... and despite making every
effort, no consensus could be reached,'' said an opera house
official who asked not to be identified.
   ``That's not uncommon with `The Ring,' which is the most
demanding work in the whole of opera. There have been many
resignations over it in many opera houses in the past,'' the
official added.
   Isaacs told a reporter: ``I regret this parting of the ways since
I admire Yuri Lyubimov's work very much. But I am sure this decision
is for the best.''
   Lybimov will be replaced by a German director, Goetz Friedrich,
58, said Isaacs. Friedrich staged the ``The Ring'' at Covent Garden
in 1974-1976. He works for the Deutsche Oper, based in the West
German cities of Duesseldorf and Duisburg.
   Haitink, 59, had chosen Lyubimov to produce the cycle over a
four-year period. ``The Valkyrie'' is scheduled for September 1989,
followed by ``Siegfried'' and ``The Twilight of the Gods'' in the
1990-91 season.
   Lyubimov scored a hit at the Royal Opera in 1986 with an
innovative staging of the Czechoslovak opera ``Jenufa,'' by Leos
Janacek. He is to stage William Shakespeare's ``Hamlet'' in 1989 in
Leicester.
   Lyubimov made his name at Moscow's avant-garde Taganka Theater,
which he founded. His productions often ran into trouble with
Communist Party officials. In 1983, Lyubimov went to London to stage
Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment'' and extended his stay,
demanding assurances he would be allowed artistic freedom in the
Soviet Union. But in 1984 he was fired from his job and expelled
from the Communist Party. Four months later, he was stripped of his
citizenship.
   Lyubimov later became an Israeli citizen. In May, he visited
Moscow and was given an ovation when he saw a performance at the
Taganka of his play about a rebel Soviet poet and singer. He is to
return to Moscow in January to direct two plays.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Reinstate Libel Award Against Philadelphia
Inquirer</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs grafs 6-7, The second, to CORRECT spelling of homicide</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
$4.5 million libel award won by a former prosecutor against the
Philadelphia Inquirer.
   The justices, citing the lack of ``a properly presented federal
question,'' let stand a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that
requires a new trial for Richard Sprague's lawsuit against the
newspaper.
   Sprague, now a Philadelphia lawyer in private practice, formerly
served as an assistant district attorney in that city.
   He sued the Inquirer and several of its reporters and editors 15
years ago over two series of articles published in late March and
early April of 1973.
   The first series of articles indicated that Sprague had
participated in an illegal wiretapping scheme.
   The second series reported that Sprague, at a time when he headed
the district attorney office's homocide division, had prevented the
bringing of homicide charges against the son of a Pennsylvania State
Police official. The series implied that Sprague's treatment of the
case was motivated by personal favoritism.
   At trial, reporter Kent Pollock testified that information for
one of the articles about the homicide case came from a confidential
source. He refused to identify the source when Sprague's lawyers
demanded he do so.
   The trial judge, noting that Pollock was legally entitled to
withhold the name under Pennsylvania's ``shield law,'' told jurors
they should not consider any evidence derived from such sources.
   The state's shield law, similar to those in many states, says no
one connected with a news-gathering organization can be forced to
disclose confidential sources to any court or government
investigation.
   The jury ruled for Sprague, awarding him $1.5 million in
compensatory damages and $3 million in punitive damages.
   A state appeals court threw out the award and ordered a new
trial, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld that ruling last
May 31.
   ``The reporter's information is properly admitted and no adverse
inference may be drawn from the invocation of the shield law,'' the
state court said.
   It said jurors should be told that invocation of the shield law
``does not establish an affirmative inference either as to the
reliability of the source or as to the validity of the information
received.''
   Plaintiffs and defendants are free to offer evidence or arguments
about reliability and validity, the state court said.
   The state Supreme Court concluded, ``If the shield law is invoked
by the defendant to avoid disclosing a source, no inference either
favorable or adverse may be drawn ... as to the reliability of the
unidentified source or as to the accuracy of the information
supplied.''
   The case is Sprague vs. Walter, 88-671.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Voting Rights Ruling in Arkansas Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld a voting rights
ruling that led to the election of a black Arkansas House member
from Crittenden County.
   The court, by an 8-0 vote, ruled against an appeal by Gov. Bill
Clinton and other Arkansas officials that had challenged the
election of Ben McGee as a state legislator.
   The case began when blacks in Crittenden County filed a voting
rights lawsuit attacking the county's at-large system for electing
two House members.
   The suit contended that the system deprived black voters of a
chance to elect a black to the House.
   A special three-judge federal court agreed last April that the
system violated the federal Voting Rights Act.
   The three-judge court threw out the results of a March 8 primary
election in which McGee, who is black, was defeated by James
Stockley, who is white, for the Democratic nomination.
   The lower court split the House voting district into two
single-member districts, and on Sept. 20 McGee won the nomination.
That was tantamount to election on Nov. 8, since no Republican ran
for the seat.
   Clinton and the other state officials said the federal court
improperly threw out the results of the first primary and ordered a
new election.
   But the federal court said the voting rights law was violated,
although it did not find intentional discrimination against blacks.
   The law does not require minority groups to prove intentional
discrimination before getting courts to order election changes.
   The three-judge court noted that there is ample evidence that
black voters in Crittenden County were deprived of a chance to elect
one of their own. It said its conclusion is supported by evidence of
highly racially polarized voting.
   One of the new single-member districts created by the lower court
has a population of more than 60 percent black.
   Today's decision, not accompanied by any opinion, upheld the
three-judge court ruling. Justice William J. Brennan, hospitalized
last week for treatment of pneumonia, did not participate in the
vote.
   The case is Clinton vs. Smith, 88-554.

   John Canning, managing editor of the New York
Post since 1980 and a journalist for more than 35 years, died while
on vacation in Ixtapa, Mexico. He was 56.
   Friends said Canning died Sunday of complications from a bleeding
ulcer after suffering a heart attack in his hotel room, according to
Eric Fettmann, assistant city editor.
   Canning was on vacation with his wife and another couple.
   Canning got his start in journalism in his native New Zealand. In
1955, he moved to Australia and worked for the Sydney Sun before
joining Rupert Murdoch's Sydney Daily Mirror in the 1960s.
   Canning was named editor of the Daily Mirror in 1978 but before
the appointment took effect he was sent to New York temporarily to
work on Murdoch papers and wound up staying here. He was named
managing editor of the weekly tabloid The Star before taking the
same position at the Post in 1980.
   The Post was sold to real estate developer Peter S. Kalikow
earlier this year.
   ``John Canning was a great editor and beloved friend to all of
us,'' said New York Post Editor Jane Amsterdam. ``His contribution
to this paper was enormous. John's intelligence and wit were
displayed to our readers each day on the front page. He will be
sorely missed.''
   As managing editor, Canning's major responsibility was designing
the paper's daily front page.
   Canning, who lived in Guttenberg, N.J., is survived by his wife,
Odette, and by a son, Simon, from a previous marriage.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a case it previously used
to give military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued,
today rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the death
of a Marine helicopter co-pilot.
   The court, without comment, refused to order a new trial in a
lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the Atlantic Ocean
near Virginia Beach, Va.
   A federal jury in 1985 ordered helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky
Aircraft to pay $725,000 to the family of David Boyle, who drowned
April 27, 1983, when his CH-53 helicopter crashed.
   Boyle and the three other crew members survived the crash impact.
The three others escaped through emergency hatches, but Boyle was
unable to open his hatch against the pressure of the water.
   His family said the design was defective, arguing the hatch
should have opened inward to permit escape.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in May 1986 threw out the
jury award against Sikorsky and its parent company, United
Technologies Corp.
   The Supreme Court, in an important 5-4 ruling last June,
substantially upheld the appeals court decision. The high court said
a military contractor is protected from suit when it makes equipment
conforming to ``reasonably precise'' Pentagon specifications and the
company warns the government about any potential dangers of which
the company is aware.
   But the justices sent the case back to the 4th Circuit court to
determine whether the appeals court improperly acted as a trial
court and decided factual issues.
   The 4th Circuit court said in August it did not usurp the jury's
function.
   ``No reasonable jury could have found for (the Boyle family) on
the facts presented,'' the appeals court said. ``It is clear in this
case that the military contractor defense was established as a
matter of law.''
   In its latest appeal to the Supreme Court, the Boyle family
argued there are factual issues that should be submitted to a jury.
The family said, for example, there is a question whether the
government actually approved Sikorsky's design and whether the
government's specifications for the escape hatch were reasonably
precise.
   The case is Boyle vs. United Technologies, 88-677.

   Official estimates put the death toll
from the Armenian earthquake at up to 60,000 today, and hopes waned
that any more survivors would be found. A second relief plane
crashed near the Armenian capital, killing seven people.
   Renewed political trouble broke out, with Armenian activists
reporting clashes with troops over the arrest of several nationalist
leaders.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, after touring the disaster
area, accused ``provocateurs'' of using the consequences of last
week's earthquake to create instability and insisted, ``They must be
stopped.''
   One Armenian activist who avoided arrest, Raphael Popoyan, said
by telephone today that three demonstrations were staged Sunday in
the Armenian capital of Yerevan.
   He said all were protesting the arrest of leaders of a committee
that has spearheaded a drive to annex Nagorno-Karabakh, a
predominantly Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan. In one demonstration,
troops and demonstrators began fighting, and several were wounded on
both sides, Popoyan said.
   An editor at Armenpress, the Armenian news agency, confirmed
there was violence at one demonstration but said the incident did
not appear serious. The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
acknowledged soldiers fired several warning shots to break up the
protest. He confirmed that police detained several leaders of the
Nagorno-Karabakh Committee on Saturday.
   A dozen tanks were parked in Yerevan's central square Sunday
night.
   Before dawn today, a Yugoslav military plane crashed while trying
to land at Yerevan airport with medical supplies _ the second crash
of a relief plane in as many days. On Sunday, a Soviet military
transport plane crashed as it approached the airport at Leninakan, a
city hard hit by Wednesday's quake. Seventy-eight people died.
   All seven crew members aboard the AN-12 cargo plane died in
today's crash, First Deputy Aviation Minister Boris Banyukov said.
   Local reporters said the plane crashed at 4 a.m. because the
pilot mistook a well-lit highway for a runway.
   The Yugoslav plane was part of an international relief effort.
Council of Ministers spokesman Lev Voznesensky told a news
conference in Moscow that 38 relief planes have arrived from abroad,
with the most _ six _ from France. He and other officials said 923
specialists from abroad with 216 search dogs were working in the
disaster area.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Geneva-based League of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies said in Yerevan there was little hope
more survivors would be found in the rubble piled high in several
Armenian cities, including Leninakan, near the quake's epicenter,
and Spitak, which was virtually wiped out.
   The spokesman, George Reid, said only people trapped who managed
to find water and had an air supply would survive.
   Reid quoted reports that only 150 people survived in Spitak,
where some 25,000 people lived before the quake. Other reports said
only 10 percent of the population remained.
   An Associated Press reporter visiting Spitak found a nearly
deserted wasteland. She said only a few hundred residents remained.
   Bitter cold weather was forecast for Armenia overnight, worsening
conditions for the 500,000 people left homeless by the quake. The
Soviet Meteorological Center said the temperature in Yerevan would
drop to 14 to 23 degrees Fahrenheit. The center did not have weather
information for the disaster area itself, but temperatures there
have generally been even lower.
   Hundreds of bonfires provided the only heat for some people who
have lived on the streets since the quake.
   The earthquake rescue effort, drawing workers and supplies from
about 40 nations, has been hampered by shortages of equipment and
haphazard organization, some officials said.
   Some aid that proved useless. A crane sat idle besides the ruins
in Leninakan. Workers said it was too small.
   Without electricity or water, Red Cross rescuers worked around
the clock by the eerie light of campfires. On Sunday, with the aid
of search dogs, they pulled out of the rubble a man in his 30s who
had broken bones in his legs but did not appear seriously injured.
   Gorbachev and international rescue workers warned of the danger
of epidemics breaking out. But one relief official from the United
Nations, Sverre Kilde, said the danger was substantially reduced by
sub-freezing temperatures in most of the region, which would inhibit
the growth of disease-carrying organisms.
   Gorbachev wound up a two-day visit to the disaster area Sunday
and called the earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale,
``a grave disaster, simply a tragedy.''
   Doctors Without Borders, an international relief organization,
said in Amsterdam that Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov told
workers the quake had claimed 50,000 to 60,000 lives. The previous
government estimate was 40,000 to 45,000.
   The Soviet Embassy in Washington said about 500,000 were left
homeless and 6,000 people were hospitalized. It said 1,500 people
had been rescued.
   Mayor Emil Kirokofyan of Leninakan told a group of foreign
correspondents that recently constructed apartment buildings were
not built to withstand such a severe temblor _ even though Leninakan
is in an area of frequent earthquakes.
   Gorbachev promised residents of the disaster zone that the
government would begin an investigation of why new apartment
buildings crumbled so easily while older buildings remained standing
after the quake.
   Officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and heavy
equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off trapped
people.
   At one site, rescuers worked feverishly with saws, torches,
hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the
top of what was a nine-story apartment building.
   The earthquake aggravated an already severe refugee problem in
Armenia, where thousands of ethnic Armenians fled because of
anti-Armenian rioting in the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.

   The Supreme Court today asked the Reagan
administration for its view of a fine of nearly $1 million against a
Maryland paper mill operator for failing to comply with a federal
clean water law's reporting requirements.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before acting on a challenge to a key provision of the act
authorizing citizens and environmental groups to sue alleged
polluters.
   The court is not expected to say whether it will grant full
review to the case before hearing from the administration, which
could take months.
   Simkins Industries Inc. runs a paper mill in Catonsville, Md., on
the banks of the Patapsco River.
   The Sierra Club sued the company for failing to monitor and file
quarterly reports on discharges into the river from Aug. 1, 1981, to
March 31, 1984.
   Under the federal Clean Water Act, the company's permit to
operate the mill required it to monitor discharges and report them.
   Simkins faced fines of up to $10,000 a day, or a total of $9.77
million. A federal judge assessed penalties of one-tenth that
amount, $977,000, payable to the U.S. Treasury.
   There was testimony that the company's plant supervisor did not
regard sampling of its discharges as a priority.
   The Sierra Club, based in California with members nationwide,
charged that Simkins had discharged copper into the Patapso at
10,000 times the safe levels for fresh water, and that oil and
grease in the river from the mill were twice the allowable limit.
   The company said the Sierra Club did not have the legal authority
to sue it because the club suffered no direct injury, and also that
the suit should be dismissed because it was filed after Simkins
stopped violating the law's reporting requirements.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May upheld the fine.
   The appeals court said the Sierra Club established that at least
one of its members who uses the Patapsco River for recreation was
injured by Simkins' violations.
   Fines for failure to monitor and report possible pollution ``can
be an important deterrence against future violations,'' the appeals
court added.
   The appeals court, citing a 1987 Supreme Court decision, said
such private citizen suits under the clean water law may not be
``based upon wholly past violations.''
   The appeals court added that Simkins was violating the law at the
time the suit was filed in late 1984. The company did not file a
complete quarterly report until January 1985, nearly three months
after the Sierra Club filed suit.
   ``It is true that Simkins' failure to sample occurred solely
before Sierra Club filed suit,'' the appeals court said. ``But
Simkins' monitoring obgligations were not designed to be a mere
academic exercise.''
   ``Unless a permit holder monitors as required, it will be
difficult if not impossible for state and federal officials...to
know whether or not the permit holder is discharging effluents in
excess of the permit's maximum levels.''
   The appeals court also noted that Simkins began monitoring its
discharges after it was alerted by the Sierra Club that it was about
to be sued.
   The case is Simkins vs. Sierra Club, 88-660.

   Shooting stars will brighten skies around the
world tonight and tomorrow night, offering viewers plenty of chance
to make a wish in areas with clear skies.
   The Geminid Meteor Shower is one of the year's most spectacular
examples of shooting stars, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory,
with the best show coming in the hours after midnight on Tuesday and
Wednesday mornings.
   Up to 50 meteors per hour will be visible if skies are clear,
according to the Smithsonian Institution.
   Meteors are caused when tiny chunks of space debris, usually no
larger than a grain of sand, enter the Earth's atmosphere and burn
up. This shower is caused by bits of an extinct comet and will be
visible all over the sky.

   Sixteen Filipinos who survived the
infamous Bataan Death March while serving in the U.S. Army during
World War II have been awarded medals 46 years after their ordeal.
   Army Maj. Gen. Theodore W. Paulson recognized the veterans'
sacrifice at a ceremony Sunday featuring a flyover by five World War
II vintage aircraft.
   The 16 honorees, many infirm with age, received the Bronze Star
and Prisoner of War medals for their internment by the Japanese
following the 65-mile forced march blamed for the death of 10,000
abused, ill and undernourished prisoners.
   The Japanese forced about 78,000 U.S. and Filipino soldiers to
make the five-day walk in strong tropical heat after surrendering
following heavy fighting in 1942.
   ``The brutality was incredible. I saw people decapitated for
falling behind,'' said march survivor and author Mariano Villarin.
   The veterans, who settled in Southern California after the war,
were honored with the medals after Congress recently passed a bill
recognizing them as U.S. servicemen and acknowledging the trials
they endured.

Cuban-Americans with relatives who have been stranded, sometimes for
years, in other countries.
   A jet carrying 183 Cubans who had been living in Spain arrived
Saturday, and 27 more arrived Sunday from Madrid. They are expected

<HEAD>Justice Minister Resigns Over Advice To Husband</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Minister Elisabeth Kopp
announced today she is resigning because of controversy over a
telephone call in which she advised her husband to break with a
company accused in a drug money laundering scandal.
   The 52-year-old Kopp, first woman to join the federal executive,
only last Wednesday was elected vice president, a post that rotates
annually and would have made her eligible to become president in
1990.
   She announced she will step down as head of the Justice and
Police Ministry by the end of February because she has come under
``unbearable pressure.''
   ``I am not morally and legally guilty of any wrongdoing,'' she
said in a statement, adding that a brief Oct. 27 telephone
conversation with her husband had gained ``disproportionate
importance.''
   In the telephone call, she disclosed Friday, she warned her
husband, Hans W. Kopp, to give up his seat on the board of the
Lebanese-controlled Zurich-based Shakarchi Trading A.G.
   A few days later, prosecutors announced they had opened an
inquiry into a $1-billion money laundering operation and accused
Shakarchi of involvement. The company denies the charge.
   Kopp, who resigned from the board a week before news of the
inquiry broke, said he did so for personal reasons and that he had
no knowledge of any illegal activities by the company.
   Mrs. Kopp said she warned her husband after her personal
assistant told her privately of the suspicions about Shakarchi. She
maintained she had no official information and did not violate the
trust of her office.
   A public opinion poll three months ago named her the most popular
Cabinet member. But her revelation caused an uproar believed without
precedent in Switzerland. Even members of her own conservative
Radical Democratic Party urged Mrs. Kopp to step down.
   A government spokesman said President Otto Stich thanked Mrs.
Kopp for her work and said she continued to command the confidence
of her Cabinet colleagues.
   Government spokesman Achille Casanova quoted Interior Minister
Flavio Cotti as saying Mrs. Kopp did ``not resign because of the
case but because of the climate.''

<HEAD>Court Avoids Decision on Pennsylvania Age-Bias Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, avoiding a decision on an
important issue for all lawsuits alleging age bias in employment,
today dismissed the case of a laid-off Pennsylvania man.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices said in effect that they had made a
mistake when agreeing to decide whether Eugene F. Brieck's lawsuit
against his former employer, Harbison-Walker Refractories, should
proceed to trial.
   The court's action was carried in a one-sentence, unsigned
decision dismissing the case as ``improvidently granted.'' Justice
Byron R. White dissented.
   The effect is to leave intact an appeals court victory for Brieck
that clears the way for further trial court proceedings in his case.
   Harbison-Walker, a division of Dresser Industries, sells
specialized ceramic brick products primarily to steel producers.
Brieck worked as an installation specialist for Harbison-Walker from
1965 to 1982.
   In July 1982, several employees of Harbison-Walker's Iron and
Steel Marketing Support Group were laid off, including Brieck. He
then was 55.
   Brieck sued in Pittsburgh in 1984, contending that he was laid
off and not recalled to work because of his age. His lawsuit pointed
to a 39-year-old installation specialist with less seniority who was
not laid off until November 1982 and then recalled eight months
later.
   Lawyers for Harbison-Walker contended that the other employee,
Hugh Faust, was retained because of his more diverse work experience.
   A federal judge threw out Brieck's suit, ruling that
Harbison-Walker had articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory
business reasons for laying off Brieck while retaining a younger man
with less seniority.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the suit
last year.
   The appeals court ruled that an employer charged with violating
the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act cannot avoid trial
by articulating legitimate business reasons if the suing employee
presents ``a reasonable inference that the employer's proffered
explanation ... is unworthy of credence.''
   The appeals court added: ``The question is not whether the
employer's asserted reason is plausible, but whether there is also
evidence of record which, if credited, could render the reason
implausible.''
   Lawyers for Harbison-Walker had argued in a session before the
justices Oct. 31 that the appeals court ruling would virtually
eliminate pretrial dismissals in employment discrimination cases.
   The case is Harbison-Walker vs. Brieck, 87-271.

   A frigid air mass spread from the Great Lakes to New England and
the South today, plunging temperatures to record lows and forcing
homeless people to shelters. One man apparently froze to death on a
New York street, and a Baltimore woman warming her heatless home
with candles died in a fire.
   Accidents on snowy roads were blamed for at least 10 deaths in
the Midwest.
   More than a foot of snow was responsible for hundreds of weekend
traffic accidents in Ohio, authorities said. Wind-whipped snow
caused hazardous driving conditions through much of Kansas.
   Snow was falling this morning over parts of Minnesota and North
Dakota. Snow was forecast for Wisconsin, a snow advisory was in
effect for eastern Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas, and wintry
weather was possible in the Carolinas beginning tonight.
   The cold air mass was so far-reaching that it produced
predictions of snow over Mississippi today, the National Weather
Service said.
   The bitter temperatures forced hundreds of homeless off the
streets in Detroit and into shelters, agencies reported.
   ``We've filled every bed we have. It usually gets worse when the
weather gets colder _ people who normally might not come here show
up because they just can't bear the cold,'' said Edith Richardson,
assistant supervisor of the 113-bed Detroit Rescue Mission.
   In New York City, police took only four homeless people to
shelters overnight. Three came in voluntarily, and a cold weather
alert gave police the authority to remove the fourth from the
streets against her will, said a department spokesman, Sgt. Maurice
Howard.
   One homeless New York man didn't make it to a shelter. The man
was found Sunday on a Brooklyn street, apparently frozen to death,
police said. The man's identity was not known.
   The temperature in New York City's Central Park hit 5 degrees
early today, breaking the previous record for the date of 9 degrees,
set in 1960.
   Thermometers also hit record lows in numerous cities across the
middle and northern Atlantic Coast states. Readings were below zero
over most of New England, New York state, Pennsylvania, the central
and northern Appalachians, northern lower Michigan and parts of
Ohio, the weather service said.
   Albany, N.Y., reached 12 below zero; Rochester, N.Y., recorded
its third coldest December temperature ever, 8 below zero; Saranac
Lake, N.Y., had the coldest temperature in the nation this morning,
28 below zero.
   Other record lows: Allentown, Pa., 2 degrees; Baltimore, 12
degrees; Boston, 2 degrees; Detroit, 2 below zero; Elkins, W.Va., 10
below; Hartford, Conn., 3 below; Houghton Lake, Mich., 12 below;
Newark, N.J., 6 degrees; Philadelphia, 8 degrees; and Wilmington,
Del., 8 degrees.
   The women's shelter at the Pine Street Inn in Boston was filled
overnight with 50 women, and the men's shelter had between 350 and
400 men.
   ``We can feel it,'' said shelter employee Anita Dzirne. A van
operated by the shelter to bring in street people ``brought in quite
a few. They're very busy tonight.''
   The cold was a factor in scattered power outages that affected at
least 2,900 customers in Connecticut, said Jeffrey R. Kotkin, a
Northeast Utilities spokesman. In Hartford, burst pipes forced
firefighters to pump water out of the first floor of the Legislative
Office Building.
   In Baltimore, a woman in her 60s died in an early morning fire in
a house where heat and electricity had been turned off. The woman
apparently was using candles for heat and light, said Fire Capt. Pat
Flynn.
   In Kansas, law enforcement officials said snowy conditions
contributed to six traffic fatalities reported Sunday.
   Three attorneys fron Wichita were killed when their car slid out
of control and collided with a truck on the Kansas Turnpike near El
Dorado. A Kansas City, Kan., woman and her daughter were killed when
her car slid into the path of a truck north of Wichita, and a
4-year-old child was killed in a weather-related accident in Butler
County, near Wichita.
   In Ohio, two young men died Sunday in a one-car accident in
Akron, where the driver lost control of his vehicle on a snowy road,
the State Highway Patrol said. On Saturday, a 30-year-old Alabama
man died after his car skidded off an icy Columbus street and into a
pond, leaving him trapped underwater 30 minutes, police said. On
Friday, a 46-year-old woman was killed after her car went out of
control on Ohio 62 during a snowstorm and into the path of an
oncoming car, the patrol said.

<TEXT>
   Incumbent Ghulam Ishaq Khan easily won
a five-year term as Pakistan's president today and Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto scored a victory in her first parliamentary vote of
confidence.
   Federal Election Commissioner S.A. Nusrat said on television that
Ishaq Khan swept 78 percent of the presidential vote.
   Of 446 valid votes, Ishaq Khan polled 348 compared with 91 to his
nearest rival, veteran politican Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Nusrat
said.
   Ms. Bhutto won her first test of strength in the National
Assembly, the country's lower house of parliament.
   Of 203 members voting on the confidence motion, 148 said ``yes''
and 55 said ``no.''
   Her Pakistan People's Party party emerged as the largest single
party Nov. 16 in the country's first free elections in more than a
decade. But with 105 seats, it fell short of an outright majority in
the 237-seat legislature. The party since gained support from
several independents and minor parties.
   The constitution dictates that the governing party pass a
parliamentary test of confidence within 60 days of forming a
government.
   The Senate, National Assembly and four provincial assemblies
functioned as an electoral college for the president.
   Provincial assemblies were restricted to 45 votes each to put
them on equal footing. The populous eastern Punjab assembly has 260
members, for example, compared to western Baluchistan's 45
legislators.
   Of the four presidential candidates, only Ishaq Khan, 73, of the
conservative Pakistan Muslim League, had the support both of Ms.
Bhutto's party and the right-wing opposition alliance, headed by the
Muslim League.
   Ishaq Khan has been credited with guiding Pakistan back to
democracy after 11 years of autocratic rule, eight of them under
martial law by President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Zia died in an Aug. 17 plane crash investigators said was
probably caused by sabotage.
   Because he was Senate chairman, the presidency was passed to
Ishaq Khan, a venerable technocrat and constitutional scholar with
nearly 40 years' experience in senior administrative posts, six of
them as finance and commerce minister.
   Pakistan's president holds a largely ceremonial post, but the
roles of both president and prime minister are under debate here.
   A 1985 constitutional amendment authored by Zia gave the
president broad but vague discretionary powers.
   Ms. Bhutto has called for a repeal of that amendment, which would
restore supreme political powers to the prime minister as they
existed during her father's government of the 1970s.
   Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in 1977. He
had Bhutto executed two years later allegedly for plotting to
overthrow a political foe.

   A man facing execution after midnight
for a 1982 robbery-murder sought a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court
today, while a second execution that had been scheduled for the same
time already was postponed.
   Raymond Landry, 39, faces lethal injection for the shooting death
of Houston restaurant owner Kosmas Prittis. Prittis, 33, a Greek
immigrant, was robbed of more than $2,300 and fatally shot in the
head.
   Last January, Landry came within three hours of execution before
the Supreme Court issued a stay in his case.
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox has labeled Landry the most
likely of the nine Texas death row inmates with execution dates to
be put to death.
   Landry's attorney, Michael Charlton, bypassed lower federal
courts and appealed directly to the high court.
   If his execution, scheduled for early Tuesday, goes ahead, Landry
would be the third inmate to be put to death in Texas this year and
the 29th _ more than any other state _ since the Supreme Court ruled
in 1976 that capital punishment in the United States could be
resumed.
   Another convicted killer, Samuel Hawkins, known as the
``traveling rapist,'' was granted a stay of execution from a federal
judge Friday. Hawkins had also faced execution early Tuesday.

<HEAD>Court Bars Government From Retroactively Applying Hospital Medicare
Payment Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a ruling likely to mean
millions of additonal dollars for some hospitals, today barred the
government from retroactively applying rules limiting reimbursement
paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients.
   By a 9-0 vote, the court rejected Reagan administration arguments
that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive
application of the government's reimbursement formula.
   The justices upheld a ruling that awarded more than $2 million to
seven hospitals. The administration said more money could be at
stake.
   The government in 1981 adopted a rule that excluded from the
Medicare reimbursement formula for private hospitals the wages paid
by hospitals owned by the federal government.
   The idea was to save money by not applying national pay scales to
private hospitals in areas with lower wage levels.
   But the Department of Health and Human Services adopted the new
rule without allowing a time for the public to comment on the
proposal. The formula was challenged by private hospitals and thrown
out by a federal judge as a violation of proper rule-making
procedures.
   The federal agency adopted the rule again in 1984 using the
correct procedure. But this time the department applied the rule
retroactively to reimbursement sought by the hospitals beginning
July 1, 1981.
   The Supreme Court today upheld a ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals here that the formula may not be applied retroactively.
   ``Our interpretation of the Medicare Act compels the conclusion
that the secretary (of HHS) has no authority to promulgate
retroactive cost-limit rules,'' said Justice Anthony M. Kennedy for
the court.
   The hospitals involved in the case are Georgetown University
Hospital and Howard University Hospital here; Tucson (Ariz.)
General, Greater Southeast Community, Tucson Medical Center, St.
Cloud (Minn.) Hospital and Community Hospital of Battle Creek, Mich.
   The case is Bowen vs. Georgetown University Hospital, 87-1097.

   Two air force planes loaded with supplies and
medical teams left for a city in earthquake-stricken Armenia today
but returned after an Israeli general there said their help would be
more useful elsewhere, officials said.
   Officials said Maj. Gen. Aharon Vardi, head of Israel's Civil
Defense, radioed the pilots that no additional medical assistance
was needed in Leninakan, the Soviet republic's second-largest city
which has been devastated by the quake.
   The U.S.-made Hercules transports had been sent to reinforce
Israeli experts who went to Leninakan on Sunday.
   A military spokesman said Vardi ordered the planes to return
because he decided ``they could not be used effectively at the
scene'' and would be more useful elsewhere, the spokesman said. He
said the planes were not turned back by the Soviet government.
   The Israeli participation in the rescue effort was seen as part
of a warming trend between Israel and the Soviet Union, which have
not had diplomatic relations since the Soviets cut ties after the
1967 Middle East War.
   On board the aircraft that left today were 46 doctors, medics,
vehicles, an electric generator, field hospital, blood and medicine,
the military said.
   Israel began sending aid to the Armenians on Sunday with a
planeload of supplies including cranes, medicines and a specially
trained rescue dog.
   As the planes took off today, Moscow's top diplomat in Tel Aviv
said this assistance would bring Israelis and Soviets closer.
   ``We are greatly moved by this,'' Georgy Martirosov, who heads
the Soviet consular delegation in Tel Aviv, said on Israel army
radio. ``This help by the Israeli people will bring us closer
emotionally.''
   The earthquake relief was the second time Israel has given
humanitarian aid to the Soviets this month and some officials have
said they hoped the Jewish state would reap diplomatic benefits.
   On Dec. 2, Israel allowed a hijacked Soviet jet to land at
Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv and subsequently
granted a Soviet request by deporting the four hijackers.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze thanked Israel for
that help in an unprecedented meeting in Moscow with Israeli
consular representative, Aryeh Levine.
   Concerning the aid to Soviet Armenia, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Allon Liel said Sunday, ``we have no intention of building political
achievements on such tragic events. I must state, though, that the
atmosphere created following this and the hijack incident last week,
is a warm and friendly one.''

<HEAD>Deposition Reveals Roy Williams' Impressions of Mob</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa
once warned his protege Roy Williams to go along with mob associates
who had infiltrated the union, according to a court deposition
obtained by a newspaper.
   ``They've infiltrated every big local, every conference, every
pension fund, and they're even into the AFL-CIO,'' Hoffa told
Williams in 1958. ``They're bad and I certainly think you should go
along with them. I'm tied as tight as I can be.''
   Williams' recollection of that conversation with Hoffa was part
of a federal court deposition, according to a story in Sunday's
editions of The Kansas City Star.
   During two days last week, Williams described his rise and fall
in the union, his relationship with the late Kansas City crime boss
Nick Civella, Hoffa and several of their Teamster and mob associates.
   The deposition will be used at the trial of a civil lawsuit
brought by the Justice Department in New York aimed at removing
Teamsters officials and mobsters who allegedly have corrupted the
union.
   Williams also said he had agreed to cooperate with the government
after he was sentenced to 10 years on the attempted bribery charge.
   He said his release from prison in September after serving about
three years was contingent upon his continued cooperation with the
authorities. He gave the deposition on the advice of his attorneys.
   Most of the questions asked by Randy Mastro, an assistant U.S.
attorney from the Southern District of New York, and other attorneys
participating in the deposition focused on Williams' association
with Civella and other organized crime leaders.
   Williams joined the Teamsters in 1938 and later, as a protege of
Hoffa, rose through the ranks as president of Local 41 in Kansas
City and finally became international president in 1981. Hoffa
disappeared in 1975 and has been presumed slain.
   Civella once told Williams that ``Kansas City was his territory
and that he had a working relation with other areas including
Milwaukee, Chicago, Cleveland and New Orleans.''
   He said he agreed with Civella's request to find work for some of
Civella's associates. He appointed George Chiavola, Civella's
nephew, as a Teamsters health and safety director, and Sam Ancona as
a general organizer. Both have been subjects of investigations by
police and federal agents.
   Williams said he met with Civella about once a month.
   Williams told the Star on Saturday, through one of his attorneys,
that he has not been threatened because of his testimony and that he
does not fear for his safety because of his disclosures.

   One moment Chris Reeves was heading toward London's
Waterloo Station aboard a commuter train, and the next he was
scrambling through a rail car roof that had ``split open like a ripe
tomato.''
   ``We were sitting next to the aisle in the buffet and when the
crash happened we were thrown down the train,'' Reeves said today as
he awaited treatment for a head injury at St. George's Hospital.
``All I can remember is dust and debris as you've never experienced
it in your life.''
   Reeves, 38, of Southampton, was among more than 100 people
injured when a British Rail commuter train slammed into a stopped
train at Clapham Junction during this morning's rush hour and then a
freight train on an adjoining track rammed into the wreckage. Dozens
were killed.
   ``There was furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying
everywhere,'' Reeves said. ``You see pictures of things like this
but when you're in the middle of it, your life goes in front of your
eyes.
   ``The whole of the buffet car disintegrated,'' Reeves said. ``The
roof split open like a ripe tomato and that's how we got out. We
tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much
debris, there was nothing we could do.
   ``I think the woman who was in there was dead _ and there was a
man lying dead on the tracks we we got out,'' Reeves said.
   Ian Underhill, 41, of Farnborough, said there was ``a hell of a
bang'' as his train approached Clapham.
   ``The train seemed to shoot backwards and the guy opposite me
flew into my face,'' said Underhill, who also was taken to St.
George's. ``Amazingly enough, there was not a lot of panic. It was
fairly calm and people were helping one another to get out. I saw
one man helped out who had lost his foot and there were many others
with terrible injuries.''
   Bob Mintram, 37, of Bournemouth, received 20 stitches at the
scene for a head wound. ``It seemed to me, the coach I was on, half
(the people) were OK and half were bad news,'' he said. He said the
woman sitting next to him was killed.
   ``There was no panic. None whatsoever, no screaming,'' Mintram
said. ``We were out in 30 seconds. We climbed out through the roof.
There were no seats left. It was a rubbish heap.''
   David Crump, 40, from King's Somborne, was in the back car of the
train that hit the stopped commuter train.
   ``Surprisingly there was no panic whatsoever. I suppose we were
in the most fortunate part of the train. We had heard the bang and a
terrible screeching sound,'' Crump said at the crash scene.
   Alun Hughes, an ambulance worker, was in the same train.
   ``There was a school on the other side of the track and the
people there started taking in the injured. They reacted remarkably
quickly and efficiently,'' Hughes said. ``There was a doctor on the
train and we both rendered first aid where we could.''
   Keith Larner, 36, from Southampton, said he saw people with metal
in their bodies.
   ``A woman was trapped with metal which was in her chest and we
just started to get people out immediately,'' he said. ``It was the
most horrible sight I have ever seen.''

initiative; picks up 3rd graf pvs, ``It's debatable.</NOTE>

   President Reagan sees no need to immediately
reciprocate for Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's announcement
of a military force cutback in Europe and Asia, a White House
spokesman said today.
   ``The president's view of this was that it was a unilateral
decision on the part of the Soviet Union,'' said spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. ``We certainly point out the unilateral nature of it as a
way of saying there is no response required.''
   Fitzwater's remarks came amid assertions by other government
officials and private analysts that Gorbachev's vow to cut the size
of the Soviet Army could put new pressure on the United States to
withdraw troops from Europe. But these same officials and analysts
said such a move would do nothing to reduce the U.S. federal deficit.
   At his daily White House news briefing, Reagan's spokesman was
asked whether it was fair to say that there would be no U.S.
response to Gorbachev's announcement last week of a 500,000-troop
reduction in Soviet ground forces along with cuts in military
armaments.
   ``It would be appropriate to say it was a unilateral decision
that did not require a unilateral reciprocal action and that no
reciprocal action is expected,'' Fitzwater replied.
   Several officials interviewed about the impact of Gorbachev's
initiative said that unless President-elect Bush is prepared to
reduce the overall size of the American military, simply bringing
home U.S. soldiers to match a Soviet withdrawal of troops from
European front lines wouldn't save money and might even cost more.
   ``It's debatable whether you get any cost savings, and if you do
they're minimal,'' says Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the senior
Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``We don't even
have the facilities here to accommodate them.''
   If Bush decides not only to withdraw troops from Europe but also
to dismiss them from the military, the budget savings could be
substantial. Pentagon officials and top brass, however, will resist
such a move.
   The service was forced to cut its strength by 8,600 soldiers in
budget cuts last year and is now fielding its smallest active-duty
force since before the Korean War in 1950 _ about 772,000.
   ``Further reductions would increase the risk to the nation's
security,'' a new Army briefing paper warns.
   Outgoing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, in several recent
speeches, has made it clear he will not include any further ``force
structure'' cuts in the Reagan administration's final budget
proposal, which goes to Congress in January.
   He has publicly urged Bush to endorse that budget proposal and
fight Congress for a 2 percent real increase in Pentagon spending.
   Carlucci further has sought to remind the American public there
are important concerns besides money that guide the stationing of
troops overseas. To be simplistic, he says it is far better for U.S.
forces to engage the enemy on foreign soil than on American
territory.
   ``It is a strategy that requires a U.S. military presence beyond
our shores _ not from habit, not as a gift _ but rather for the
defense of U.S. interests and U.S. prosperity,'' he said in a speech
last May.
   ``Bringing U.S. troops home from abroad would not save money
unless we deactivate them.''
   ``There are some expenses you incur by posting troops overseas
that you don't face here, including swings in the valuation of the
dollar, higher travel costs, etc.,'' said one top Pentagon financial
officer who asked not to be identified.
   ``But that's small potatoes compared to the fact that we don't
have the housing or facilities at our bases to accommodate these
guys. The refurbishing and construction would be a huge expense.''
   The United States has about 318,000 servicemen assigned to
Western Europe, of whom about 212,000 are Army troops. Another
200,000 are deployed to other countries around the world or at sea
on Navy ships, meaning roughly 25 percent of the American
active-duty force of 2.1 million is deployed outside the United
States.
   Gorbachev told a United Nations audience last week that the
Soviet Union will unilaterally reduce its own military of more than
5.1 million by 500,000 troops and pull back 50,000 assigned to the
front lines facing NATO.
   Retired Rear Adm. Gene R. LaRocque, the director of the Center
for Defense Information and a frequent critic of Reagan
administration policies, argues that the United States could easily
remove 50,000 troops from Europe without jeopardizing NATO security.
   ``I'm concerned that if we don't respond in some way, the
Soviets' initiative will be of no avail to reducing forces in the
long run,'' he says.
   ``There's nothing magic about the number of troops we have there
now. Pulling troops back to the U.S. doesn't do anything for your
budget this year, but if conditions improve then we can gradually
shrink our forces.''
   Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counters that the cuts announced by Gorbachev would still leave the
Warsaw Pact with a strong numerical advantage in conventional
forces. Alliance leaders should be ``first, watchful, and second,
wary'' of Gorbachev's moves, Crowe said last week.
   Barry Blechman, a former government arms control executive and
now a defense consultant, maintains that the United States could
save $15 billion if half of its troops and 10 bomber squadrons were
deactivated.
   The United States should use the Gorbachev initiative as a
starting point for negotiating mutual, 50 percent troop reductions,
he says, adding: ``This military competition is out of sync with
today's politics and economics.''

<TEXT>
   Rebels say they shot down a U.S.
locust-spraying plane in the belief it was a Moroccan military
transport and apologized for the attack, which killed the plane's
five American crewmen.
   The Polisario rebel movement said Sunday it would retrieve the
five bodies from the desert and return them to their families in the
United States. It made no mention of compensation, and it wasn't
known how long the recovery would take.
   The DC-7 was shot down Thursday in one of the most desolate parts
of the Sahara Desert. There is no regular human settlement for more
than 50 miles in any direction, and nothing grows in the wilderness
of rock and sand.
   A second DC-7 was also hit but managed to make it to an airfield
400 miles away and made an emergency landing with its five crew
members safe.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
downing of the plane ``once again underscores the need to seek a
peaceful end to this long-running conflict.''
   Asked if the U.S. government accepted the explanation offered by
the Polisario, Fitzwater said, ``We don't have any reason to believe
otherwise.''
   The statement issued by the Marxist-led Polisario group said the
attack, in the no man's land between Morocco's defensive wall and
the Mauritanian border, was ``neither premeditated nor
intentional.'' It expressed ``deep sorrow.''
   The statement, telexed from Polisario headquarters in Algiers to
The Associated Press in New York and distributed locally, said the
planes were mistaken for Moroccan military C-130s.
   It said Polisario would return the five bodies to their families
without delay.
   It ascribed the incident to the spirit of Polisario's desert
patrols, who it said were ``daily attacked by Moroccan aircraft.''
   There was no immediate reaction to the statement from Moroccan
authorities.
   Morocco has insisted that the incident happened over Mauritanian
territory. Following vigorous Mauritanian denials, however, a
Moroccan government statement late Saturday acknowledged the planes
were attacked over the 40-mile-wide no man's land between the
defense wall and the border.
   The planes were chartered by the U.S. Agency for International
Development and were flying from Dakar, Senegal, to Agadir to take
part in the campaign against the growing plague of locusts along the
fringes of the Sahara.
   Polisario has been fighting Moroccan forces for control of the
Western Sahara since the Spanish army withdrew from the former
Spanish colony in 1975. The United Nations is trying to organize a
referendum among 80,000 inhabitants, but Polisario insists on a
prior withdrawal of Moroccan troops and administrators.
   The two sides also disagree about who should be allowed to vote.

   The nation's oldest synagogue celebrated its
225th anniversary by expressing gratitude for the religious freedom
it has enjoyed.
   ``We have been a symbol (of religious tolerance) for both the
Jewish world and the gentile community,'' Rabbi Chaim Shapiro said
Sunday.
   Almost 300 people of differing faiths crammed into the Touro
Synagogue for a traditional Friday night Sabbath service that was
seasoned with references to the holiday of Hanukkah.
   Hanukkah, which means dedication, commemorates the cleansing and
resanctification of the Temple in Jerusalem by the Maccabees
following their victory over the pagan Greco-Syrians in 165 B.C.
   The Maccabees' struggle, said temple President Bernard Kusinitz,
is ``the first recorded battle for religious freedom in history.''
   This year, he also noted, the dedication celebrated by the
holiday parallels the rededication of the landmark synagogue.
   Participants in the Sabbath service and various parties this
weekend felt ``a combination of pride and at the same time a certain
gratitude to the Jewish and gentile communities that welcomed us,''
Shapiro said.
   In 1759, 100 years after the first Jewish families sailed into
Newport, the community decided to build a synagogue.
   The congregants, who by this time numbered 35 families, hired
architect Peter Harrison.
   It is assumed that Harrison, a Quaker who had never seen a
synagogue, based his design on Isaac Abraham Touro's description of
his childhood synagogue in Amsterdam. Touro was the temple's cantor.
   ``There are enough similarities between the two that we feel they
have to be related,'' Kusinitz said.
   The brick building, which stands 95 percent intact, ``is a
mixture of Colonial architecture with traditional Jewish motifs,''
Shapiro said.
   ``As simple as it is on the outside, it is as beautiful on the
inside,'' Kusinitz said.
   In 1790, two years before the enactment of the Bill of Rights,
George Washington issued a letter from the synagogue promising the
new government of the United States would give ``to bigotry no
sanction, to persecution no assistance.''

   Beside the graves of former slaves and the
work of a modern arsonist, people from six states proclaimed that
the burned New Bethel AME Church of Rocky Fork would once again
serve its tiny congregation.
   Frequently vandalized through the years, the church was rebuilt
after it was destroyed by arson in April, only to be torched again
in October. A suspect in the second fire is awaiting trial.
   ``It's like when you lose a loved one,'' said Frank Bennet of the
200 people who attended the gathering Saturday in this southern
Illinois town about 25 miles north of St. Louis. ``People come and
you didn't even know they cared.''
   Bennett, who lives in nearby Alton and is not a member of the
congregation, said he attended out of respect for those who lost
their church.
   Morris M. Ewing of Los Angeles heard about the rally while
attending a stamp collecting convention in Chicago. He stopped by on
his way home and wrote a check for $300.
   Ewing urged others in the audience not to become bitter about the
fires. ``It takes only one or two individuals to upset the
progress,'' he said.
   Last year, racial epithets were carved into the walls of the
church, which serves a predominantly black congregation, and
swastikas were spray-painted on the building.
   ``People feel that after the civil rights movement of the '60s
that racism died. It didn't. But if we work together, we can kill
it,'' said Dennis L. Roach of the Rainbow Coalition of St. Louis.
   The Rev. Steven A. Jackson, pastor of the 25-member congregation,
estimated that Saturday's donations would amount to $10,000 to
$12,000. Rebuilding the church is expected to cost about $65,000.
   The church in this town of 2,600 residents was founded in 1863.
Its yard is adorned with headstones, both recent and decades old. In
some cases only jagged hunks of rock mark the graves.
   Jackson said many of the former slaves who founded the church are
buried there.
   Authorities said James Russell Calvin, 19, of Alton confessed to
setting the October fire and is awaiting trial on one count of
arson. He has not been linked to the earlier blaze.
   Calvin, who is white, said he was not motivated by racism but by
rumors from friends that the building was used by devil worshipers.

   The Reagan White House is keeping a line open
to the Soviet Embassy to see what further assistance the United
States might provide to earthquake victims, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   A day after President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, paid their
respects at the embassy here, Fitzwater said there have been so many
offers of help that the switchboard at the mission has been jammed.
For this reason, he said:
   ``We have lines open on a continuing basis to receive their needs
and find out what they're looking for. They're trying to define
better the need at this point.''
   Fitzwater said that the United States has spent roughly $825,000
to ferry experts and supplies to the ravaged region in Armenia. He
said that one Defense Department C-141 cargo plane had arrived there
and that a second was en route.
   The spokesman estimated that a total of about $2.47 million had
been raised through the weekend, through private means, to aid the
earthquake victims. An additional $3 million was raised during a Los
Angeles telethon Sunday.
   Fitzwater also estimated that roughly $22.9 million has been
collected through international means for assistance to the
earthquake region.
   ``The process at the moment is to continue what we have been
doing,'' he said, which for the most part involves helping to see to
it that donated food, medicine and other supplies get to the
stricken region.

jazz musician Charlie Parker, received a special award for using
blacks in his films in positive, non-stereotypical roles, said NAACP

   After being handed his award by Forest Whitaker, who portrayed
Parker in ``Bird,'' Eastwood thanked the NAACP and said he looked
forward to the day when such racial awards would be ``obsolete.''

<HEAD>Indiana Governor to Name Rep. Coats to Quayle's Seat</HEAD>

statement on Senate seat planned this afternoon.</NOTE>

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle will be
replaced in the Senate by conservative Republican Rep. Dan Coats, a
former aide recently elected to a fifth term as an Indiana
congressman, a party source said today.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Indiana Gov.
Robert Orr would make a formal announcement of the appointment later
in the day.
   Quayle and Indiana's other senator, Republican Richard Lugar,
also were scheduled to make a statement on the subject this
afternoon, according to a Quayle spokesman who declined to divulge
any other information.
   Coats, 45, was elected in 1980 to fill the 4th Congressional
District seat Quayle vacated to run for the Senate. He worked in
Quayle's congressional office in Fort Wayne, Ind., from 1976 to
1980, and was known to have Quayle's backing in the jockeying to
pick a new senator for Indiana.
   In the House, Coats has compiled a staunchly conservative record.
His rating for 1986 from the American Conservative Union was 82
percent. His rating the same year from the liberal Americans for
Democratic Action was 10 percent.
   He is a supporter of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and to the
Angolan rebels. In 1984, he attempted to attach an amendment to an
omnibus education bill that would have cut off federal aid to
schools and states banning voluntary school prayer. The amendment
was defeated.
   Calls to Coats' office were unreturned today. Orr brushed aside
questions as he attended a Christmas-tree trimming ceremony in the
Statehouse in Indianapolis, instead telling reporters to talk to
Santa Claus.
   Coats will serve as an appointed senator until a special election
is held in 1990 for the remaining two years of Quayle's term. An
election for a full six-year Senate term will be held in 1992.
   Coats' selection also means a special election will be held to
fill his House seat, probably in March.
   His selection will leave the total of Senate Republicans in the
incoming, 101st Congress at 45. The Democrats will be in the
majority with 55 seats.
   Quayle has announced his intention to resign from his Senate seat
by Jan. 2. That would permit Coats to be sworn in a day ahead of the
senators elected in November, thus gaining an advantage over the
rest of the class in seniority.
   Party sources said that in selecting Coats, Orr was hoping to
find a politician capable of building a strong political and
financial base to withstand a Democratic challenge for his seat in
either 1990 or 1992.
   Several other names had been mentioned as potential candidates
for Quayle's seat, including former White House political director
Mitchell Daniels, who is a political protege of Lugar. Daniels took
himself out of contention several weeks ago, as did Marilyn Quayle,
wife of the vice president-elect.
   Others who had meen mentioned as contenders included Rep. Dan
Burton, Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut, Marion County Prosecutor
Stephen Goldsmith and Lt. Gov. John Mutz, who was defeated last
month in a bid for the governor's office.
   Orr was moving to fill the Senate vacancy before his own term
ends early next month, to prevent Indiana's incoming Democratic
governor, Evan Bayh, from naming a Democrat to the post.

   Dan Coats has made a career of following Dan
Quayle _ first as his aide, later as a congressman and now as the
vice president-elect's apparent successor in the U.S. Senate.
   ``We call them the two Dans because Dan Coats worked for him and
followed him to Congress,'' said Robert E. Gates, the 4th District
Republican chairman.
   Coats, 45, was expected to be formally named by Gov. Robert D.
Orr this afternoon to fill Quayle's Senate seat for the next two
years, according to a source in the Republican Party.
   Coats' rise to the Senate marks the second time in his career he
has filled a vacancy left by Quayle. In 1980, Coats, then Quayle's
district representative, won his first term in the U.S. House in the
same year his boss won the Senate seat.
   Although their careers have followed similar paths, the two men
are different in background and style, friends say.
   Coats was born in Jackson, Mich., graduated from Wheaton College
and then served in the Army. He received his law degree by attending
night classes at Indiana University in Indianapolis.
   Quayle, a native Hoosier, also attended the Indianapolis law
school while serving in the National Guard during the Vietnam War.
   Four years older than Quayle, Coats joined Quayle's staff in 1976
after working as an assistant vice president and legal counsel for
Mutual Security Life Insurance Co.
   In contrast to Quayle, an exuberant campaigner, Coats is ``very
low-key,'' said former Secretary of State Edwin J. Simcox, who went
to law school with Coats.
   Simcox, who had been in the running for Quayle's seat, said of
Coats: ``I think a great deal of him. He's an outstanding person.''
   Gates called Coats, a Fort Wayne resident, especially attentive
to his constituents' wishes.
   ``He's not ultra-conservative. He really studies what the people
want and votes that way. He takes a lot of surveys,'' said Gates.
``He really cares for his people.''
   That attentiveness has translated into significant vote-getting
appeal, the party official noted.
   In fact, Coats has never received less than 61 percent of the
vote in the northeastern Indiana district.
   On Nov. 8, he won 62 percent of the vote in defeating Jill L.
Long, a Democrat who lost to Quayle in the 1986 Senate race.

   Three trains collided in south London at the height
of this morning's rush hour, killing dozens of people and injuring
more than 100 in a vast tangle of crushed metal.
   John Norris, the London Fire Brigade divisional officer, said
nine hours after the crash that all the bodies were thought to have
been recovered, and the death count stood at 35. Police Detective
Inspector Barry Webb said another person died in a hospital,
bringing the toll to 36.
   Norris told reporters the death toll had fluctuated during the
day because some bodies were dismembered.
   A London Ambulance Service spokeswoman, who requested anonymity,
said 115 passengers were hospitalized, 30 with serious injuries.
Others were treated where they lay on the ground or in the wreckage,
and some people had to have limbs amputated to extricate them.
   Lou Gill, the Fire Brigade's chief divisional officer, said all
survivors had been removed about five hours after the crash near
busy Clapham Junction just before 8 a.m. But he said he feared that
when the mangled wreckage was finally cleared ``there may be further
bodies underneath.''
   Norris also did not rule out a further increase in the death toll.
   Rescue workers used metal cutters to pry open rail cars strewn
like matchwood across the tracks. Scores of people suffered minor
injuries and were treated on the scene.
   Jim Rowe, a spokesman for British Transport Police, a law
enforcement unit controlled by state-owned British Rail, said at the
scene that about 1,500 people were aboard the 20 passenger carriages
involved in the crash.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came out of a meeting in her
Cabinet room and told reporters she was ``grief-stricken.''
   ``It brings home to us very much that families have lost some of
their dearest people ... it is even more poignant just coming up to
Christmas,'' she said.
   Transport Secretary Paul Channon, facing opposition Labor Party
charges of overcrowding trains and cutting safety expenditures,
promised the House of Commons an independent public inquiry would be
set up.
   Rowe said a crowded passenger train traveling at 40 mph to 50 mph
slammed into the back of a stationary commuter train about a
quarter-mile south of Clapham Junction.
   An empty freight train traveling on an adjoining track in the
opposite direction then crashed into the spillover wreckage, he said.
   ``We were going pretty fast, about 70 miles an hour,'' said Greg
Ford, 28, who was on the passenger train. ``It went `bang' and that
was it. We were all over the place.''
   Roy Daniel, 37, was in the buffet car when ``the train started
stopping and we started falling on top of each other. We came to a
stop and the (buffet) counter was sort of lodged on top of us. That
saved us.''
   Chris Reeves, 38, of Southampton, also was in the buffet car. He
said he saw ``furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying
everywhere.''
   ``The whole of the buffet car disintegrated,'' Reeves said. ``The
roof split open like a ripe tomato and that's how we got out. We
tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much
debris, there was nothing we could do.''
   Today's was the third serious rail accident in a month in
Britain. On Nov. 30, 15 passengers were injured when two express
trains collided outside the Newcastle-upon-Tyne in northeast
England. On Nov. 12, a driver was killed and 18 passengers badly
hurt in a crash near St. Helens in northwest England.
   The ambulance service said today's collision occured at the
bottom of an embankment, making it difficult to reach the injured.
Some cars overturned, the fire brigade said.
   The injured were ferried to five hospitals in a fleet of 20
ambulances.
   British Rail said the commuter train was the 7:18 a.m. from
Basingstoke, southwest of London, traveling along the main British
Rail line to London's Waterloo station. The second train was the
6:14 a.m. from Poole, on England's southern coast, also heading
toward Waterloo, British Rail said.
   Emmanuel High School near the scene of the crash was used as a
makeshift clinic.
   Boys from the school scrambled down the banks to help rescue
survivors, and elderly people at a nearby day center handed out tea
to survivors.
   Alec Jackson, a school official, said scores of passengers
arrived at the school bleeding, dazed and missing teeth.
   Britain's worst crash occurred in 1915, when 227 people were
killed and 246 injured in a collision between a troop train and
passenger train in southwest Scotland.

<HEAD>Court Grants Treasure Hunter Right to Salvage Pirate Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled today that a
treasure hunter has the right to recover cargo and artifacts from
the submerged 18th century pirate ship ``Whydah.''
   In a unanimous opinion, Massachusetts' highest court rejected the
state's claim of sovereignty over the wrecked wooden sailing vessel,
lying beneath the sand in the waters off Wellfleet on Cape Cod where
the it foundered in April 1717.
   ``The ill-fated Whydah, nearly three centuries later, has sailed
into this court's jurisdiction as the subject of a dispute between
contemporary treasure seekers and the would-be modern sovereign of
the coastal waters,'' Justice Neil Lynch wrote for the high court.
   He described the case as ``a conflict mired in competing claims
of title to the shipwreck and its cargo, involving issues of federal
maritime and admiralty law, and disputed dominion over submerged
lands in the marginal sea.''
   In November 1982, Barry Clifford and his salvage company,
Maritime Underwater Surveys Inc., found ``an unidentified, wrecked
and abandoned vessel'' one mile off Wellfleet under about 14 feet of
water and 5 feet of sand.
   Since 1983, Maritime Surveys, using sophisticated sensing and
recovery technology, has recovered numerous artifacts from the site,
while waging legal battles with the state, the federal government
and rival treasure hunters over who owns the wreck of the
commandeered English merchant ship.
   Gold, silver, cannons and pistols recovered from the ship have
been valued at $14 million to $25 million, and the total bounty is
estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   After winning his claim of ownership to the Whydah in U.S.
District Court, Clifford was sued by the state, which asked a state
Superior Court to confirm its claim of title to the vessel and its
cargo.
   The Superior Court appointed Clifford temporary custodian of the
wreck, and on that basis, he won a permit from the state Board of
Underwater Archaeological Resources to salvage the ship.
   Later, faced with claims from Clifford, the state and other
searchers, the state court granted Clifford's company title to the
vessel.

<HEAD>Detention Center Destroyed In Cuban Uprising To Be Rededicated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OAKDALE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new $17 million federal prison was
dedicated today in this western Louisiana town, replacing the
detention center that rioting Cubans burned in a night of terror 13
months ago.
   The new beginning gives townspeople the chance to look to the
future, but they should not forget the rioting, U.S. District Judge
Earl Veron warned in his dedication speech.
   Veron recalled watching the television coverage of the prison
going up in flames as Cuban detainees rampaged through the Oakdale
Federal Detention Center.
   ``I cannot understand how these defendants wanted to burn down
these excellent facilities they had, and think by burning them down
and taking hostages they would gain their freedom,'' said Veron.
   ``It is not up to me, and I express no opinion on the conduct the
United States should take against those that destroyed $15 million
in taxpayers' property.''
   More than 1,000 Cuban inmates awaiting decisions on whether they
would be freed or sent back to Cuba rioted and took 28 employees
hostage on Nov. 21, 1987, at the Oakdale center. The siege lasted
eight days, and the hostages were released unharmed.
   Although Bureau of Prison officials do not want to answer
specific questions about security, the new facility has some obvious
differences from the old one. Within the 40-acre prison, two of the
four dormitories are isolated by a high chain-link fence and a guard
post.
   Also added is a maximum security building, which has over 50
individual cells. Each cell door has a small hole and each inmate
must put his hands through that hole to be handcuffed before the
door is opened.
   The showers also have bars.
   The new Oakdale facility will handle prisoners who have been
sentenced by federal judges to prison terms. Under construction at
the site is a $14 million federal deportation center, which will
open in November 1989 to handle detainees.
   The rebuilt prison has 265 inmates at this time and can
accommodate 1,300, prison officials said. There are 400 guards.
   The deportation center will have 1,000 beds and perhaps as many
as another 400 guards, said a spokesman for Warden O.C. Jenkins.
   About 200 people shivered through the rededication ceremonies in
the open-air basketball court on the prison grounds. None of the
inmates was in sight and the prison looked empty.
   Despite last year's riot, Mayor George Mowad said he looked
forward to reopening the prison the community worked so hard to
secure and was so proud of when it opened in 1986.
   ``If someone had been killed there probably would have been more
bad feelings,'' he said recently. ``We're ready to get on with the
program.''
   The town's economy has fluctuated since the riot, and
unemployment in Allen Parish is about 11 percent, Mowad said.
   ``It was 31 percent back in January 1982 when we first started
this thing. It was the highest in the country,'' Mowad said. ``It
wasn't all the prison, but it certainly has been a major reason why
unemployment (went) down.''
   Rioting at the federal prisons in Oakdale and in Atlanta two days
later erupted shortly after the State Department announced that Cuba
had agreed to take back more than 2,500 of the 3,800 Mariel refugees
who were locked up nationwide at the time. More than half were in
the federal detention center in Oakdale.
   The takeovers ended after the government agreed to a moratorium
on deportations and a one-time-only Justice Department review of
each U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service decision.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   NCAA-Discipline
   
   The court, in a setback for college basketball coach Jerry
Tarkanian, bolstered the power of the NCAA to discipline its member
schools.
   The 5-4 ruling also could help the National Collegiate Athletic
Association in its effort to police drug use by athletes at
state-run member schools.
   The court said the NCAA, in disciplining Tarkanian, did not
violate the constitutional rights of the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas coach because the athletic body acted as a private
organization, not one operating with governmental authority.
   The case is NCAA vs. Tarkanian, 87-1061.
   
   MEDICARE
   
   The court barred the government from retroactively applying rules
limiting reimbursement paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients.
   The court, in a 9-0 ruling likely to mean millions of additional
dollars for some hospitals, rejected Reagan administration arguments
that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive
application of the government's reimbursement formula.
   The case is Bowen vs. Georgetown University Hospital, 87-1097.
   
   EVIDENCE
   
   The court ruled that a government investigator's conclusions and
opinions are not ``hearsay'' and may be used as evidence in federal
trials.
   The justices reversed a federal appeals court ruling that had
ordered a new trial in a wrongful-death lawsuit against the makers
of a Navy airplane in which two people crashed six years ago.
   But today's 7-2 vote appeared to make a new trial necessary,
because the justices also ruled that the plaintiffs' lawyers wrongly
were limited in presenting their case.
   The case is Beech Aircraft vs. Rainey, 87-981.
   
   GARBAGE
   
   The court, having already ruled that privacy rights do not extend
to garbage left at curbside for pick-up, refused to treat
differently garbage discarded closer to home.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a
convicted Fremont, Neb., man had no privacy right in garbage cans
left outside for collection four feet from his home's back door.
   Unlike the court's decision last May in a case from California,
today's order sets no national precedent.
   The case is Trahan vs. Nebraska, 88-697.
   
   TENURE
   
   The court agreed to study a university's attempt to withhold
confidential information from a faculty member who says her denial
of tenure was due to illegal discrimination.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by University of
Pennsylvania officials accused of discriminating against a Chinese
woman denied promotion to full professor.
   But the justices indicated that they will be studying a very
narrow issue in the case _ one dealing with which trial court had
the authority to hear it.
   The case is University of Pennsylvania vs. EEOC, 88-493.
   
   LIBEL AWARD
   
   The court refused to reinstate a $4.5 million libel award won by
a former prosecutor against the Philadelphia Inquirer.
   The justices, citing the lack of ``a properly presented federal
question,'' let stand a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that
requires a new trial for Richard Sprague's lawsuit against the
newspaper.
   The case is Sprague vs. Walter, 88-671.
   
   HELICOPTER CRASH
   
   The court rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the
death of a Marine helicopter co-pilot.
   The court, without comment, refused to order a new trial in a
lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the Atlantic Ocean
near Virginia Beach, Va. The court previously used the case to give
military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued.
   The case is Boyle vs. United Technologies, 88-677.
   
   SODOMY
   
   The court threw out a Kentucky man's sodomy conviction because he
was barred at his trial from questioning the alleged victim, a white
woman, about her living with a black man.
   By a 7-1 vote, the justices overturned the conviction and 10-year
prison sentence of James Olden. The court expressed skepticism about
the alleged victim's testimony that she did not consent to have sex
with Olden.
   At the trial, the defendants' lawyers sought to introduce
evidence that the woman was living with another man, Bill Russell,
who is black and a half-brother of Olden.
   The trial judge refused to let the defense lawyers question the
woman about whether she was living with Russell. The judge said
allowing evidence of an inter-racial living arragnment would have
created ``extreme prejudice'' against the woman.
   The case is Olden vs. Kentucky, 88-5223.
   
   VOTING RIGHTS
   
   The court upheld a voting rights ruling that led to the election
of a black Arkansas House member from Crittenden County.
   The court, by an 8-0 vote, ruled against an appeal by Gov. Bill
Clinton and other Arkansas officials that had challenged the
election of Ben McGee as a state legislator.
   
   CLEAN WATER
   
   The court asked the Reagan administration for its view of a fine
of nearly $1 million against a Maryland paper mill operator for
failing to comply with a federal clean water law's reporting
requirements.
   The court said it wants to hear from Justice Department lawyers
before acting on a challenge to a key provision of the act
authorizing citizens and environmental groups to sue alleged
polluters.
  feet away, even under mounds of concrete.
   Orange-clad German Red Cross volunteers follow their search dogs,
telling the exhausted Soviets where they should dig first. They work
around the clock, aided by the campfires after dark.
   The volunteers had a moment of joy Sunday when a 33-year-old man
was found alive after more than four days under a collapsed,
three-story building.
   Hundreds of onlookers stood on the rubble as rescuer Peter
Schaefer of Hamburg slowly extracted the survivor. He said his name
was Ruben as he was carried away on a stretcher, with jubilant
Armenians feeding him water and pressing a cigarette into his
trembling hand.
   Reflecting the chaos in Spitak, there was no ambulance to take
him to a makeshift hospital outside the city center. After a few
frantic minutes, the rescuers commandeered the van used to transport
the German search dogs.
   The scene kindled little hope in despairing relatives like Gegush
Aganyan, a 50-year-old woman who stood a tearful vigil by her son's
wrecked apartment. She came from a mountain village in hopes her
son, Tateus, and his pregnant wife had somehow survived.
   ``It was to be my first grandchild,'' she said. ``But I think
there is no chance for them to be found alive.''
   Others searchers reported miraculous tales of survival amid the
more common discoveries of entombed families.
   ``We still have hope, although not much,'' said Artur Tovmasyan,
a volunteer directing the cranes lifting concrete slabs and
corrugated metal roofing. He said he had helped dig out 12 survivors
in the past three days.
   A list of fewer than 2,000 survivors has been written on green
sheets of paper at a shack marked with a hand-lettered sign:
``Regional Communist Party.'' Hundreds clamor around it, shouting
the names of those they seek.
   ``We already know who is missing from here,'' said Zori Zayakan
of Martuni, a village about 100 miles from Spitak. ``The
reunification effort is disorderly, but people know they can find
out if they ask at enough places.''
   Another survivor, Mayor Arzumanyan, said outside his obliterated
apartment that he ran home from the factory as soon as the main
earthquake stopped. At first he was shocked that the seven stories
above his second-floor home were spread like gray boxes in front of
the foundation, then noticed his rear apartment had been exposed by
the collapse.
   ``I pulled my two granddaughters and my younger daughter out
myself,'' said Arzumanyan, 54. ``My wife and my older daughter were
in the city to buy groceries. I didn't know what happened to them
until yesterday (Saturday).''
   His wife survived, but his 27-year-old daughter was flown to
Moscow in critical condition and he did not know her fate.
   Like others remaining in Spitak, Arzumanyan has been camping in
the near-freezing weather with bedding salvaged from the wreckage,
waiting for debris to be cleared away. He says he must find
documents and a stash of money to help his family resettle.
   Most of the homeless have been taken to undamaged areas of the
mountainous republic or bused to Yerevan, where they wait for
flights or other transport to stay with relatives elsewhere.
   The discomfort of waiting without lodging, food or access to
toilets is mostly taken in stride by Armenians who see the
earthquake as another chapter in their tragic history.
   ``We lost 1.5 million people in 1915,'' said Varchik Azaryan,
resurrecting the bloody Turkish invasion of 73 years ago. ``We have
survived that as a nation and we will survive whatever fate we
meet.''

<TEXT>
   Paul Nitze, President Reagan's principal arms
control adviser, said Monday that Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's plan to turn a controversial radar installation in
Siberia over to civilian and eventually international control does
not satisfy U.S. concerns.
   The United States has long maintained that the radar at
Krasnoyarsk should be torn down because it violates the 1972
Anti-Ballistc Missile treaty.
   The treaty permits radars on national borders pointed outward to
detect incoming missiles. The United States says the Krasnoyarsk
radar is a violation because it is in the middle of Soviet territory
facing inward where it might be used in an early-warning battle
management system.
   ``Turning it over to Soviet and international scientists isn't
satisfactory to us,'' Nitze said.
   ``There is no way we can be certain these civilian scientsts will
remain in charge,'' he said. ``They could convert it to an
early-warning radar in no time at all.''
   Nitze commented in an interview by international journalists and
others on Worldnet, a television production of the U.S. Information
Agency beamed overseas.
   In his address beferson ended with more
than 17,000 messages of support for the journalist, organizers say.
   ``We have encouraged prayers, we have encouraged letters ...
we're getting letters from all over the United States,'' Jack
LaVriha of the Free Terry Anderson Committee said Dec. 8.
   LaVriha said that although some people think Anderson will not
see the letters, he believes they will be given to him.
   ``The world will be watching,'' LaVriha said. ``I think there's
going to be some compassion shown.''

   Sonja Henie's icy heart won't be left out in
the cold when the warehouse where it has been stored for nearly 48
years is demolished to make room for a frozen foods plant.
   The blue-green ice sculpture was presented to the famous
Norweigian skater and movie star during a Valentine's Day 1941
performance at the Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum _ the star's one and only
appearance in Omaha.
   Miss Henie said she would return for it some day. But she died in
1969 without ever claiming what CBS newsman Charles Kuralt once
called ``the longest-running, open-ended, most enduring publicity
stunt of all time.''
   Barney Oldfield, who was an Army publicist when he carved the
heart, said Miss Henie found her appearance in Omaha less than
heart-warming. Among other things, he said, she was upset that high
costs cut into her profits.
   ``All she was really interested in that night was to get it ...
out of the dressing room because it had green-blue dye and it was
dripping on her dressing room floor,'' Oldfield, now an executive
for Litton Industries, said in a telephone interview from his
Beverly Hills, Calif., office.
   So the heart was taken to the Omaha Cold Storage Co. warehouse
near the Mississippi River, and there it has remained over the
years, gaining in notoriety as it shrunk from its original 100
pounds to about 60 pounds.
   ``It is highly flattering that something made 45 years ago out of
the most perishable substance on earth _ frozen water _ would still
be in existence in a cold storage warehouse in Omaha,'' Oldfield
said.
   When plans were announced to tear down the warehouse to make way
for a new ConAgra frozen foods complex, there was some concern about
the fate of the heart. But Roy Mattson, owner of Omaha Cold Storage,
said he has moved the sculpture to his company's new warehouse in a
converted meat-packing plant.
   ``It's in a box in a room with a lot of raw materials for making
pet food _ liver, salisbury glands, items like that,'' Mattson said.
``I'd hate to throw it away. I'd probably get in trouble.''
   ``I suppose some good-hearted guy will continue to take care of
it,'' Oldfield said. ``It has been kind of like a relay race. There
have been 10 or 12 people who had custody of it from one time to
another.''
   Oldfield, born in Elk Creek, Neb., said he hoped to visit the
heart during a trip to Omaha later this month. He recalled how the
ice show's promoter approached him in 1941 about a publicity stunt,
but warned Oldfield that Miss Henie wasn't always friendly.
   Oldfield carved the heart out of a keg of ice and presented it to
Miss Henie at the Valentine show. As the promoter had warned,
however, she gave Oldfield the cold shoulder.
   ``As kind of an exit line, I said we would keep it until she came
back to Omaha again,'' Oldfield said.
   ``We put it in the back of a pickup _ it was 10 degrees below
zero that night. After the show we took it to Omaha Cold Storage and
stored it there. It was forgotton until I came back after World War
II and was in Omaha for Christmas before the victory march in New
York.''
   Oldfield said no one has tried to buy the heart but that the
Guinness Book of World Records has called about it.
   ``They found somebody with a 36-year-old cake in storage and they
were toying with the idea of a strange category that would include
such things, but nothing came of it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Backs NCAA Censure of UNLV Coach</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 9-13, I can't say, with reaction</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, in a setback for college
basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, today bolstered the power of the
NCAA to discipline its member schools.
   The 5-4 ruling also could help the National Collegiate Athletic
Association in its effort to police drug use by athletes at
state-run member schools.
   The court said the NCAA, in disciplining Tarkanian, did not
violate the constitutional rights of the University of Nevada-Las
Vegas coach because the athletic body acted as a private
organization, not one operating with governmental authority.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said the
university does have governmental power because it is a state-run
school.
   But Stevens said the NCAA, in seeking to discipline Tarkanian,
was acting independently from UNLV.
   ``The NCAA and UNLV acted much more like adversaries than like
partners engaged in a dispassionate search for the truth'' in
investigating Tarkanian, Stevens said.
   The NCAA ``is more correctly characterized as an agent of its
remaining members, which, as competitors of UNLV, had an interest in
the effective and evenhanded enforcement of NCAA's recruitment
standards,'' he said.
   The ruling's impact on Tarkanian's career at UNLV _ or the
school's big-time basketball program _ was not immediately apparent.
   ``I can't say at this point what will happen to Mr. Tarkanian,''
said Jack Kitchen, one of the NCAA's lawyers in the case. ``That's a
matter the committee on infractions will have to take a look at,''
he said.
   ``As far as the impact on the NCAA itself, this is a good
decision,'' Kitchen added.
   Tarkanian, when told about the decision, said, ``Naturally, I'm
disappointed.''
   He refused to discuss what action UNLV might take in his case,
saying, ``I don't want to get into that right now. I'm going to let
my lawyer talk for me.''
   But Sam Lionel, Tarkanian's lawyer, said he did not want to
discuss the decision until he had a chance to read the court's
opinions.
   Tarkanian, a highly successful coach who has been at UNLV since
1973, was accused in 1976 of numerous rule violations by the NCAA.
   NCAA officials said he arranged for a student to bet a ``B''
grade without attending class, provided free air fare to a
student-athlete, encouraged individuals to give the NCAA false
information to impede its probe, falsely certified UNLV's program as
being in compliance with NCAA rules and failed to comply with high
ethical standards.
   The NCAA placed the UNLV basketball program on two years'
probation in 1977 for recruiting violations and ordered the
university to suspend Tarkanian from coaching for two years.
   But Tarkanian obtained a court order blocking the suspension and
continued coaching.
   The Nevada Supreme Court said the NCAA had violated Tarkanian's
constitutional rights by failing to afford him due process during
its lengthy investigation.
   Today, however, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the lower court
order in ruling that the athltic organization, lacking governmental
authority, was not required to adhere to constitutional standards in
its probe.
   Tarkanian's lawyers had warned that lifting the court order
against the NCAA could mean the NCAA may throw UNLV out as a member
if the university refuses to suspend Tarkanian.
   Individuals and private organizations generally cannot violate
someone's constitutional rights. Only a government and its agents
can do that because the Constitution protects against governmental,
but not private, wrongdoing.
   The NCAA is a private organization representing nearly 1,000
colleges and universities, more than half of them state-run.
   Today's ruling could enhance the organization's power to
investigate drug abuse by athletes by not requiring it to observe
constitutional restrictions in probing for abuses.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Barred the government from retroactively applying rules
limiting reimbursement paid to hospitals treating Medicare patients.
   The court, in a 9-0 ruling likely to mean millions of additional
dollars for some hospitals, rejected Reagan administration arguments
that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive
application of the government's reimbursement formula.
   _ Ruled that a governfment investigator's conclusions and
opinions are not ``hearsay'' and may be used as evidence in federal
trials.
   The justices reversed a federal appeals court ruling that had
ordered a new trial in a wrongful-death lawsuit against the makers
of a Navy airplane in which two people crashed six years ago.
   _ Having already ruled that privacy rights do not extend to
garbage left at curbside for pick-up, refused to treat differently
garbage discarded closer to home.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that a
convicted Fremont, Neb., man had no privacy right in garbage cans
left outside for collection four feet from his home's back door.
   Unlike the court's decision last May in a case from California,
today's order sets no national precedent.
   _ Agreed to study a university's attempt to withhold confidential
information from a faculty member who says her denial of tenure was
due to illegal discrimination.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by University of
Pennsylvania officials accused of discriminating against a Chinese
woman denied promotion to full professor.
   But the justices indicated that they will be studying a very
narrow issue in the case _ one dealing with which trial court had
the authority to hear it.
   _ Refused to reinstate a $4.5 million libel award won by a former
prosecutor against the Philadelphia Inquirer.
   The justices, citing the lack of ``a properly presented federal
question,'' let stand a Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that
requires a new trial for Richard Sprague's lawsuit against the
newspaper.
   _ Rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the death of
a Marine helicopter co-pilot.
   The court, without comment, refused to order a new trial in a
lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the Atlantic Ocean
near Virginia Beach, Va. The court previously used the case to give
military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued.
   In today's high court opinion in the Tarkanian case, Stevens
said, ``The NCAA is properly viewed as a private actor at odds with
the state when it represents the interests of its entire membership
in an investigation of one public university.''
   Stevens said the fact that UNLV could forfeit its standing as a
basketball ``powerhouse'' if it is kicked out of the NCAA does not
mean the university was forced to fire Tarkanian.
   ``That UNLV's options were unpalatable does not mean that they
were nonexistent,'' he said.
   Stevens was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Dissenting were Justices Byron R. White, William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor.
   White, in an opinion joined by the others, said UNLV's agreement
to abide by NCAA rules governing conduct of its athletic program
made the NCAA a partner with the university in disciplining
Tarkanian. ``I would find that the NCAA acted jointly with UNLV and
therefore is a state actor,'' White said.
   The case is NCAA vs. Tarkanian, 87-1061.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs, hospital officials say six injured, not

   Six people, including a young American woman,
were injured today when a firebomb was thrown at a passenger bus in
Arab east Jerusalem, causing the bus to crash into a wall and a
parked car, police said.
   Among the injured was Salwa Kanana, an American citizen from
Wisconsin, who was seen lying in an ambulance wearing a neck brace.
Hospital officials said five other bus passengers received light
injuries.
   Police closed off Saladin Street, east Jerusalem's main
commercial street where the crash occurred, to search for the
assailant.
   ``The moment the bottle was thrown, the front windshield of the
bus was covered in fire and smoke,'' Deputy Police Chief Maod Halevi
said. ``The driver kept going until he slammed into a wall and a
Subaru nearby.''
   Earlier, riot police chased stone-throwing Palestinian school
girls into a sacred mosque complex in Arab east Jerusalem and fired
tear gas at the demonstrators, witnesses said.
   Police said four demonstrators were arrested.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, merchants shuttered their stores for
a second straight day to mourn the deaths of two residents killed
Saturday by army gunfire.
   In the occupied West Bank, troops raided the village of Salem
near Nablus and ordered residents to paint over pro-PLO slogans.
Villagers stoned soldiers who opened fire, wounding a 22-year-old in
the left leg, said officials at Nablus' Al Ittihad Hospital.
   The protest in Jerusalem erupted on the Temple Mount, which is
sacred to Moslems and Jews. The mount, known in Arabic as Haram
Al-Sharif or Noble Enclosure, houses the Al Aqsa mosque and Dome of
the Rock shrine _ the holiest sites in Islam after Mecca and Medina
in Saudi Arabia.
   Several hundred teen-age girls gathered in front of their
religious high school inside the complex, chanting ``Allahu Akhbar''
(God is great) and throwing stones at police, said police and Arab
merchants in the area.
   Police entered the complex and started firing tear gas, said
Mohammed Jamal, a member of the Supreme Islamic Council which
administers the two mosques.
   ``While I was talking to the girls about what was going on, they
(police) shot four canisters inside the school, and then they shot
more and more,'' Jamal told The Associated Press.
   He said none of the tear gas got into the mosques, which are
about 50 and 100 yards from the school.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy and his assistants could not
be reached for comment despite several calls to their office and
residences.
   Jamal said he asked the students to go home, and most eventually
dispersed. A group of about 50 continued to chant ``Allahu Akbar''
on their way to east Jerusalem's central bus station, where mounted
police charged into the group.
   AP photographer Max Nash said the teen-agers fled into the narrow
corridors of the station, pursued by club-wielding mounted police.
One, about 16, grabbed a policeman's club and tried to pull him off
the horse, Nash said.
   Police hit some teen-agers who responded by throwing rocks and
bottles. Police charged into buses in search of agitators. Three
girls and one boy were detained.
   Gaza shops were closed to mourn the deaths Saturday of a
16-year-old Gaza City youth who hurled a firebomb at soldiers and an
Arab prisoner who attacked a guard with a homemade knife.
   The deaths brought to 322 the number of Palestinians killed in
the year-long revolt against Israeli rule. Eleven Israelis also have
been killed.

   Emily Sachar, city schools reporter for New York
Newsday, is the winner of the 1988 Peter Kihss Award for Outstanding
Reporting on New York City Government and Public Affairs, it was
announced Monday.
   Ms. Sachar will receive a $5,000 grant at a ceremony Tuesday. The
award honors Peter Kihss, a reporter who covered the city for 50
years and retired from The New York Times in 1982. He died two years
later, shortly after receiving the first Kihss award.
   ``Emily Sachar has been a reporter since 1980, and has covered
Newsday's public education beat with distinction since 1986,'' said
Edward Costikyan, chairman of the award selection panel.
   ``She shares with Kihss a mind that is curious, discriminating
and hungry for the little details and statistics that say to the
best reporters: dig here,'' Costikyan said.
   The award is sponsored by the Fund for the City of New York.

<TEXT>
   Anthony ``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, convicted
mob chieftain and ousted Teamsters official, died today in a
hospital near the federal prison where he was serving a 20-year term
for racketeering, authorities said. He was 71.
   Provenzano died at 7:56 a.m. at Lompoc District Hospital, said
Chuck LaRoe, spokesman for the maximum-security prison 140 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
   Provenzano, who had been confined to the hospital for treatment
of congestive heart failure, died of a heart attack, the spokesman
said.
   He had been serving a 20-year, 11-month and 29-day sentence on
two racketeering conspiracy offenses, LaRoe said.
   In July 1975, former Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa disappeared while
on his way to a Detroit meeting with Provenzano, a member of the
Genovese crime family. Hoffa is presumed dead, but his body was
never found.
   Provenzano was first sentenced to four years in prison by a
federal judge in New York City in July 1978. In July 1979, he was
sentenced by a federal judge in New Jersey to another 20 years.
   ``He had a tentative release date of Aug. 13, 1992, and had
waived parole consideration,'' said LaRoe.
   A resident of Hallendale, Fla., Provenzano began his sentence at
Lompoc on Nov. 18, 1980. Due to his age and poor health, he hadn't
participated in a prison work assignment for the past two years,
LaRoe said.

<TEXT>
   The space shuttle Atlantis continued its
cross-country trip from California to Florida today, taking off from
an Air Force base near Tucson atop a modified jumbo jet.
   The orbiter, which landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California
last week after completing a classified military mission, left the
Mojave Desert base at 3:27 p.m. Sunday, said Charlie Baker, shuttle
area manager for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
at Edwards.
   Carried piggyback atop a Boeing  reached
Arizona's Davis-Monthan Air Force Base 90 minutes later, where it
stayed overnight. The plane took off from the base shortly before
noon on the next leg of its trip, headed to Kelly Air Force Base
outside San Antonio, Texas.
747, the shuttle   The final leg should take the shuttle from Kelly to
the Kennedy
Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla., said NASA spokesman Joseph
D'Agostino.
   Rain could delay completion of the flight, he said Sunday. Flying
through rain can damage the thousands of ceramic tiles affixed to
the shuttle's belly to ward off the heat of re-entry into the
Earth's atmosphere, he said.
   Atlantis landed Tuesday after a four-day secret mission that
reportedly included deployment of a med to a mechanical air pump so the
bear mimics the
deep, gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy, sleeping person.
   A research project under way at the university and St. Francis
Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford has shown that the bears can
help regulate breathing by inducing deep, quiet sleep in preemies,
who frequently suffer respiratory disorders, said Evelyn Thoman, the
behaviorist who designed the project.
   ``This is a stimulation that I call biologically relevant,''
Thoman said in a recent interview. ``It's sort of like having a
companion to sleep with. It's breathing, just like mummy and daddy.''
   Thoman came up with the idea about 15 years ago and experimented
on rat pups deprived of their mothers. Those given a surrogate
mother _ a warm, moist, pulsating tube _ survived. Those without a
surrogate died.
   Premature infants were a natural subject for the study, since
they too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated in
an incubator.
   It took Thoman years to come up with the design for the bear _
commercially made ones have protruding snouts and limbs that keep
infants at a distance _ and a pump that could duplicate the gentle
rhythm of human breathing.
   Harvard Apparatus Inc. of South Natick, Mass., developed the pump.
   After some preliminary work, she got a $500,000 grant from the
National Institute of Child Health ahd Human Develpment for a
three-year study that runs until May. Thoman and her research
assistants monitor how the babies respond to the bears through
time-lapse photography.
   The experiment is based partly on the physics principle of
entrainment, which holds that all pulsating or beating objects,
animate and inanimate, tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects.
   The phenomenon explains why a half-dozen grandfather clocks on
the same wall, all beating at different tempos, eventually will
synchronize. In people, it means the various body rhythms _ sleep
patterns, temperature, breathing, heartbeat _ influence each other,
Thoman said.
   Thoman theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies, and that
aside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulate
brain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up to
the toys.
   Doctors have known for years that underdeveloped, premature
infants, isolated in an incubator away from their mothers and the
outside world, need stimulation to thrive. But the stimulation used
for years has been passive and inescapable: the incessant sound of
an electrical heart implanted in a stuffed animal, the rising and
falling of a breathing air mattress.
   The babies in the experiment snuggle with their bears about half
the time, and move away by themselves the rest of the time.
   Thoman's bears have been mentioned in writings on sudden infant
death syndrome, but she cautions that it's far too early to theorize
that a device that helps regulate breathing will help prevent the
mysterious killer of apparently healthy babies.
   ``We have demonstrated the bear facilitates maturation and that
it helps the babies breathe more regularly,'' she said. ``There is a
logical jump to say, `Shouldn't (that) help prevent SIDS?' And in my
wildest dreams, I would hope so. But that's too far away, there is
too much research to be done.''

<HEAD>Americans Say Christmas Too Commercial, But Still Plan to Buy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are in a giving mood this Christmas,
although a vast majority believe the holiday has become too
commercialized, according to a Media General-Associated Press poll.
   Three-quarters of those answering the poll said they intend to
spend the same amount of money or more on gifts than in past years,
and fewer than one in four intend to spend less.
   Seven years ago, when joblessness and inflation were considerably
higher, an AP-NBC News poll found that 69 percent of the public
intended to cut back on gift-giving.
   The new poll found that 85 percent of the public believes that
Christmas is too commercialized, but 87 percent still said they
looked forward to it.
   The survey of 1,084 adults in the continental United States was
conducted by telephone between Nov. 10 and Nov. 20.
   Ninety-six percent of those answering the survey said they
celebrate Christmas. Eighty-nine percent identified themselves as
either Catholic or Protestant; the rest were Jewish, ``other,'' or
had no religion.
   The poll indicated that most Americans are religious, although
religious observance varied considerably among regions and among
different ethnic and social groups.
   About a third of the public thinks of Christmas as mainly a
social holiday, while about one-quarter regard it as primarily
religious. But the largest number _ 38 percent _ consider it both
religious and social.
   The poll also showed that nearly seven in 10 Americans are
churchgoers, and four in 10 said they had been to church the week
before the poll. Sixty-four percent said they generally go to church
on Christmas.
   The poll found that most Americans intend to spend at least $200
on Christmas gifts this year, and one in four will spend at least
$500.
   Sixty-nine percent intend to give gifts to at least 10 other
people, and 20 percent will be giving to 20 or more people. Only 3
percent don't plan to give any gifts.
   Seven in 10 people said they usually receive the gifts they
really want for Christmas, while one-quarter don't.
   The poll showed that younger adults are more likely to look
forward to Christmas than their elders, and that they also are much
more likely to view Christmas as a primarily social, and not
religious, holiday.
   Older people are much more likely to view Christmas as overly
commercialized.
   The poll also indicated that Americans who live in the South and
Midwest are more religiously observant than those in the West and
Northeast, and that black Americans are more religiously observant
than whites, conservatives more than liberals.
   For instance, 75 percent of those in the South and 71 percent of
those in the North-Central states said they attend church services
during the year, compared to 69 percent in the Northeast and 57
percent in the West.
   Eighty-three percent of blacks are churchgoers, compared to 69
percent of whites; 75 percent of conservatives compared to 56

   The only hard feelings following pop star Elton
John's libel suit against a London newspaper came from a judge who
castigated both sides for milking the case for publicity.
   ``Sorry Elton,'' said the headline over a front-page story in The
Sun's late edition Monday announcing a $1.84 million out-of-court
settlement, and the paper quoted John as saying: ``This is the best
Christmas present I could wish for ... and I don't bear The Sun any
malice.''
   But High Court Judge Michael Davies, who had been scheduled to
begin hearing John's action later Monday, voiced his ``disapproval
and distaste'' at the way the settlement was announced in The Sun
before it could be approved by the court.
   ``One would think that Elton John and the newspaper had formed a
mutual admiration society,'' he said. ``The parties were determined
to milk the situation in order to obtain the maximum publicity to
both sides.''
   John told reporters: ``I don't think it is any of the judge's
business.''
   The Sun said it apologized for the allegations it published in
February 1987 which quoted a young man's account of John's private
life, and acknowledged that they were false.

   British pop star Sting said Monday that he would
rather sing love songs than songs about human rights abuses, but
that the state of the world leaves him no choice.
   ``I'd much rather be singing songs about romantic love than human
rights abuses, but as long as the world is as it is, I have no
choice,'' Sting told a news conference.
   Sting, British singer Peter Gabriel and Senegalese singer Youssou
N'Dour were in Geneva to give U.N. officials some 500,000 signatures
supporting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that were
gathered during their six-week ``Human Rights Now'' concert tour for
Amnesty International.
   The declaration was adopted by the United Nations 40 years ago,
but it still needs to be implemented, Gabriel said.
   ``Clearly, very few (governments) practice what they have agreed
to in this document,'' he said.

   ``Now that I am an old man, I would have loved to have met this
great lady, but fate did not wish it to be so _ this time,'' Walesa

myself as Santa Claus so that no one will recognize me, and I will
go see her with a present.''
   Walesa was scheduled to leave Paris late Monday following a

   Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move to the
back of the bus 33 years ago marked the beginning of the modern
civil rights movement, said minorities still face obstacles to
``first-class citizenship.''
   ``The powers that be seem to have the means still to downgrade
those who are already down, and they continue to do it,'' said
Parks, 75, who was honored Sunday by the American Civil Liberties
Union.
   Parks received the Earl Warren Civil Liberties Award from the
Northern California branch of the ACLU for her refusal to obey a
Montogomery, Ala., bus driver's order to give up her seat on a bus
to a white man.
   Her subsequent arrest set off a year-long boycott of Montgomery's
bus system led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   Parks, who now lives in Detroit, said at a news conference that
blacks still lack equal opportunities for jobs and are still subject
to continuous prejudice, particularly the portrayal of them as
``lacking motivation.''

   The Agriculture Department will bar timber
harvesting in certain parts of national forests in Oregon and
Washington in order to broaden habitat protection for the spotted
owl, the chief of the Forest Service said Monday.
   F. Dale Robertson said most of the new habitat areas will range
from 1,000 to 2,000 acres in size, and will serve as protection for
nesting owls as well as providing ``stepping stones'' between larger
areas, totaling more than 1.6 million acres, already protected as
owl habitats.
   In the Olympic National Forest, the new habitat areas may be as
large as 3,000 acres each, he said.
   In all, the special habitat areas are expected to reduce the
annual timber harvest on national forests in Oregon and Washington
by about 180 million board feet.
   Each of the 13 national forests that have owls will share in the
linkage system. The exact number will not be determined until the
forests submit final management plans to ensure that spotted owl
populations will be maintained.
   ``This has been an extremely difficult decision to make, but I
believe it strikes a reasonable balance between the two conflicting
goals of sustaining spotted owl populations and providing timber
supplies that are vital to the economies of Oregon and Washington,''
Robertson said.
   The Forest Service, a USDA agency, has been embroiled in
controversy concerning its management plans for spotted owl
habitats, notably in the Pacific Northwest where there are concerns
that protection of the birds could adversely affect the timber
industry.
   However, Robertson said the controversy has not been confined to
his agency, noting that a lawsuit against Interior's Bureau of Land
Management has resulted in an injunction prohibiting BLM from
harvesting mature timber on some lands the agency administers in
Oregon.
   Also, the Fish and Wildlife Service is being challenged in court
over its 1987 refusal to designate the owl a threatened or
endangered species.
   Meantime, authorities in Oregon voted last week to deny a place
on the state list of endangered or threatened species to a
robin-sized seabird called the marbled murrelet after biologists
were unable to determine the bird's population.
   ``We simply don't have good baseline data on the murrelet's
population size nor any trends indicating changes in that
population,'' said Rod Ingram, chief of the wildlife division for
the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission.
   The Oregon chapter of the Audubon Society and the Oregon Natural
Resources Council had petitioned to place the bird on the list under
the new Oregon Endangered Species Act last January.

   A man arrested after shooting his estranged

hidden in his clothing, police said.
   Morgan A. Patterson, 38, of Crystal, shot his wife, Rosemary E.
Patterson, 34, at her Fenwick home Sunday evening, said Montcalm
County Sheriff Don Godell.
   Witnesses subdued Patterson before deputies arrived, Godell said.
   He was handcuffed and locked in a holding cell at the jail when
he asked two guards if he could use the bathroom, which is in the
same cell and is not enclosed.
   After the guards removed his handcuffs, he turned his back,
pulled a derringer from his clothing and shot himself in the chest,
Godell said. The guards were in the cell at the time. Patterson died
at the jail.
   ``It (the gun) was under his shirt or under his belt,'' he said.
``We don't know exactly where he had that hidden.''
   It was unclear whether deputies or guards searched Patterson
before he was taken to jail, Godell said.

   A moderate earthquake rocked portions of
Southeast Alaska early Monday, rattling windows but causing no
reported damage or injuries, the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center
reported.
   Geophysicist Paul Whitmore said the 9:57 a.m. (AST) temblor
measured 4.7 on the Richter scale. It was centered about 90 miles
northwest of Juneau, or 40 miles west of Haines, he said.
   The quake rattled windows in Juneau and Haines, he said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 time
stronger than one of 6.5.
   The 1964 ``Good Friday'' earthquake in Alaska measured 8.5 on the
Richter scale and was centered in Prince William Sound. It generated
large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed
114 people as far south as Oregon and Hawaii.

   Kidnappers holding U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins said in a statement released Monday they have
sentenced him to death as a spy for Israel.
   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this
American spy,'' said the typewritten Arabic statement signed by the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
   ``The spy has been turned over to those responsible for executing
this just and revolutionary verdict,'' said the statement delivered
to the Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.
   The statement did not give a date when the sentence was to be
carried out.
   A photocopy of a photograph purporting to show Higgins in a dark
sweater was pasted to the bottom of the 15-line statement. Captors
of foreign hostages in Lebanon usually provide a photograph to
authenticate their statements.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was head of a 76-man observer
group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when
he was kidnapped near the southern port city of Tyre on Feb. 17.
   ``It has been proven by clearcut evidence that he and his
American team of observers are guilty of providing the Zionist enemy
with accurate and detailed military and security information about
our resistance fighters, their positions, movements, supply routes
and the quantity and quality of their weaponry,'' the statement said.
   It said the decision to kill Higgins was a retaliation for
Israeli attacks against ``our people in occupied Palestine'' and
predominantly Shiite south Lebanon.
   The statement also said Higgins was sentenced to die in ``revenge
for the blood of the martyrs of the latest Israeli raid'' on a
Palestinian guerrilla base nine miles south of Beirut. Nine
guerrillas were killed Friday in the Israeli attack. An Israeli
officer also died.
   Fifteen foreigners are missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon.
They are nine Americans, three Britons, one Irishman, one Italian
and a Swiss. The longest held is American Terry A. Anderson, 40,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Higgins, 43, a decorated Vietnam veteran, is married to Marine
Maj. Robin Higgins and has a 17-year-old daughter.
   He graduated from high school in Louisville, Ky., and from Miami
University of Ohio on ROTC scholarship in 1967. He earned master's
degrees in human resources management at Pepperdine Univiversity in
California and in political science at Auburn in Alabama.

Says</HEAD>

   A potentially dangerous shortage of nurses in
the United States is best solved by boosting pay scales for career
caregivers and making sure they have time to be nurses instead of
clerks, a federal commission said Monday.
   ``It is the sincere belief of the commission that the health of
this nation will be at risk if the changes suggested in these
recommendations do not occur,'' the report said.
   ``The institutions themselves have to change the very way they
allow nursing to be practiced,'' Carolyne K. Davis of Cleveland,
head of the special advisory panel, said at a news conference.
   The report said higher pay will help, particularly for career
nurses, but that better financial compensation alone is not the
answer.
   The commission was convened a year ago by the Department of
Health and Human Services. An underlying theme of its report, which
to be presented to HHS Secretary Otis R. Bowen, is that nurses yearn
for time to nurse.
   Nurses also want recognition for their nurturing instincts and
acquired knowledge, and they want to be respected and consulted by
the physicians who write up the orders telling them how to care for
their patients, the report said.
   ``With increasing frequency, nurses provide services that should
be carried out by other health care workers,'' the commission said.
   The report said hospitals ``should preserve the time of the nurse
for the direct care of patients and families by providing adequate
staffing levels for clinical and non-clinical support services.''
   Without using the word doctor, another recommendation said,
``Close cooperation and mutual respect between nursing and medicine
is essential.''
   On the pay issue, the panel said starting salaries are not so
much a problem as the lack of opportunity to see compensation grow
with experience.
   It cited statistics showing that while the average $22,000
starting salary for a nurse two years ago was only $2,000 below that
for an engineer, the engineer was making $41,000 five years later
compared with $27,000 for the nurse.
   Davis said the current average salary for all working registered
nurses is $25,000 a year.
   Calculating that there are at least 137,000 ``budgeted vacancies
in just the hospital and nursing home sectors alone,'' the panel
said hospitals have laid off 100,000 non-nursing employees over the
past five years.
   Although nursing school enrollments are down, the commission said
a growing demand for nurses is more a factor in the shortage than
lack of people in training _ partly because the patients now being
hospitalized tend to be sicker as a group than a few years ago.
   Outpatient treatment is now more likely for the less seriously
ill, leaving hospitals with the most difficult cases and the
accompanying need for a higher nurse-to-patient ratio.
   ``Unless this shortage is addressed, I can anticipate there might
be some impact on the quality of care,'' said Lillian K. Gibbons,
the federal official designated to coordinate the panel's work.
   The document was welcomed by the Federation of Nurses and Health
Professionals. ``The commission's recommendations are very similar
to what we have been advocating for a long time,'' said Candice
Owley, the union's vice president. ``We are encouraged that the
federal government has finally given proper recognition to the
problems of the nursing profession and has offered some concrete
solutions to the crisis.''
   The American Association of Colleges of Nursing also said it
welcomed ``the substantive actions'' recommended by the commission.
   ``Nursing is a critical national resource,'' said Geraldene
Felton, AACN president, dean of the University of Iowa College of
Nursing and a member of the HHS commission. ``The nation's enormous
concern and efforts to relieve the shortage are clear evidence of
the crucial value of that resource. We must move forward and not
ignore the important plan of action proposed by the commission
today.''

   Mourning Tibetans made shrines of stones around
pools of dried blood on Monday, a day after a clash with police who
were seen taking residents from their homes, Western travelers said.
   Travelers reached by telephone in Lhasa said they heard
unconfirmed reports of Tibetans throwing stones at police patrols
after dark Sunday and of police firing tear gas.
   China's official media has not reported any arrests, but said one
Tibetan Buddhist monk was killed and 13 people were injured when
police fired warning shots Saturday at 30 Tibetans who marched into
the central square waving their banned nationalist flag.
   An English-speaking tourist who asked not to be identified said
some Tibetans told her their friends and relatives had disappeared
and were believed arrested.
   Robert Dean, 24, of Auckland, New Zealand, said he saw police
drive up to Tibetan homes, talk to residents and lead some away.
``One particular (official) I saw four times at four different
homes, taking four different people away,'' he said.
   Authorities allow few foreign reporters to travel to Tibet and
then only when conditions are calm.
   Police on Monday confiscated the passport of a Dutch woman who
was shot in the arm, and the ticket office for the state airline
said she was not allowed to leave town, a Canadian friend said.
   Ron Schwartz, a professor at the University of Newfoundland in
St. John's, said he tried to buy a ticket to Canton for Christa
Meindersma of Amsterdam, but was refused. Ms. Meindersma was treated
at a Lhasa hospital and released.
   ``We wanted to take her to Hong Kong and put her in a hospital,''
said Schwartz.
   Ms. Meindersma and Schwartz witnessed Saturday's protest, but
both said they had no connections to anti-Chinese Tibetan activists.
   Dutch consular attache Willem de Bruin said in Beijing he would
ask Chinese authorities to allow Ms. Meindersma to leave. ``I hope
this is just a formality,'' he said, adding he was disappointed
authorities had given him little information on her condition.
   Tibetan nationalists, including Buddhist monks and nuns, dispute
China's claim to seven centuries of sovereignty over Tibet. They
want an independent country led by the Dalai Lama, the leader of
Tibetan Buddhism who has been in exile in India since an abortive
anti-Chinese uprising in 1959.
   Tibetans have staged many small protests in the past 14 months,
but Saturday's was the third to turn bloody. At least 38 people were
killed in violent clashes with police Oct. 1 and March 5.
   China has maintained that foreign travelers took part in some
previous protests, but has not made such charges about Saturday's
violence.
   Police searched guest rooms at the Yak backpacker hotel Sunday
and Monday, said Todd Johnson, 24, of Santa Cruz, Calif.
   ``They seem to be looking for particular individuals who they
believe were eyewitnesses,'' he said.

   A Cuban exile who tried to hijack a commercial
airliner to Cuba but was tricked into landing on an island south of
the Bahamas was questioned Monday by FBI agents trying to learn his
motive, officials said.
   Felix Sanchez Rodriguez, 26, allegedly used a fake bomb to demand
the TWA flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, be diverted to Cuba. He
was arrested after the plane landed instead in the Turks and Caicos
Islands, a British colony.
   ``They tricked him good and nobody got hurt _ that's the
important thing,'' said Paul Miller, FBI spokesman in Miami.
   The hijacking attempt, only the second attempt on a domestic U.S.
airliner in more than two years, ended when the Boeing 727 and its
121 passengers flew on to Miami Sunday night.
   ``All we know for sure is that the man wanted to go to Cuba,''
Miller said. ``He apparently wanted to see his mother _ she was
either very sick or dying. Because of the language difference it was
difficult to find out for sure.''
   An FBI agent interviewed Rodriguez at his jail cell on Grand Turk
Island, Miller said, adding that it probably will be several days
before the man is brought to Miami to face federal air-piracy
charges.
   The pilot of Flight 469 was able to get permission to land on
Grand Turk island where police, using a Spanish-speaking person,
were able to convince Rodriguez he was in Havana, Miller said.
   ``He was horrified to realize he had been tricked,'' said
passenger Willie Douglas of Montgomery, Ala.

   One of 10 children who made and sold
pottery to pay for her education in Guatemala, Nicolasa Menchu was
used to beating the odds when she arrived here in 1986 with a
serious spinal curvature that doctors said eventually would have
killed her.
   Almost three years later, she is on her way back to her native
land, not only out of danger, but 2{ inches taller and with a
bachelor's degree in elementary education from the University of
Louisville.
   At a farewell party at the university last Friday, the huge smile
that has become ``Niko's'' trademark among her friends said it all.
   ``I feel excited and at the same time I feel sad,'' said Ms.
Menchu, who recently celebrated her 28th birthday. ``I have so much
to say thank you for to all the people who helped me make my goals.''
   Ms. Menchu's ordeal began last fall when she developed breathing
problems while swimming. She was turned over to Dr. John Johnson,
co-director of the spine clinic at Louisville's Norton Hospital.
   Ms. Menchu underwent a series of four operations, all free, to
correct a 142-degree curvature of her spine that was choking off her
vital organs. Doctors said the operation carried a 60 percent chance
of success and a 20 percent chance that the patient would not
survive.
   While she still experiences some pain in her back when it is
cold, Ms. Menchu doesn't complain. ``I just hold it in,'' she said.
   Her sights are set on becoming a special education teacher in
Guatemala City.
   But she will never forget the American doctor who saved her life.
   ``He offered me his help, and I don't have anything to pay him
with,'' she said. ``I just have to show him some kind of
appreciation. It was not just something simple, it was something for
my life.''

<TEXT>
   Likud and Labor negotiators met for six hours
Monday about a possible coalition government of the two main
parties, and Labor demanded electoral reforms to curb the power of
religious parties.
   Small religious parties won 18 of the 120 parliament seats in the
Nov. 1 election and hold the balance of power between the
conservative Likud bloc, which got 40 seats, and the center-left
Labor Party with 39.
   They have demanded important Cabinet posts and stricter
government policies on religion as terms for joining a right-wing
coalition with Likud, led by Prime Minster Yitzhak Shamir.
   Negotiators from both major parties reported progress in Monday's
talks and some predicted a coalition deal would be made this week.
   Likud and Labor, whose leader is Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,
have been equal partners in a ``national unity'' coalition since the
indecisive election of July 1984. The leaders traded jobs two years
ago.
   Many issues appeared unresolved after the meeting of the
three-member teams Monday in Jerusalem, but Moshe Katzav, a Likud
Cabinet minister, told army radio as he emerged:
   ``There was progress. There are still a few open questions, but
... we have established intensive discussions and we want to finish
as soon as possible. I hope that we conclude the discussions in a
day or two.''
   Israel radio said the negotiators focused on guidelines for a
joint government and agreed to an evenly divided Inner Cabinet,
which makes the major security and foreign policy decisions.
   A Labor official close to Peres said privately the party demanded
electoral reforms, including direct election of the prime minister
and requiring more votes to qualify for a seat in the Knesset,
Israel's parliament.
   Each party assigns Knesset seats from its own candidate list on
the basis of how many votes it receives.
   Requiring more votes per seat would make it difficult for smaller
parties to get into parliament, thus limiting the power of religious
parties, among others.
   After negotiating with right-wing and religious parties, Shamir
turned back to Labor in an apparent effort to avoid major
concessions on religious and political issues demanded by the small
factions.
   His talks with those parties continue, however, and officials
close to the prime minister said the factions may join whatever
government is formed.
   The Peres aide said Labor opposes Likud's agreement with the
far-right Tehiya and National Religious parties to build 40 new
Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
next four years.
   Six new settlements were authorized in the four years of
Labor-Likud coalition that began in 1984.
   Yossi Ahimeir, an adviser to Shamir, said Likud wants more
emphasis on new settlements but is prepared to ``reconsider'' if
Labor joins the government.
   About 70,000 Jews live in more than 130 settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza, where a rebellion began a year ago among the 1.5
million Palestinian residents.
   According to the Peres aide, Labor will insist on the right to
oppose such religious legislation as the proposed ``Who Is a Jew''
law, which would accept only conversions to Judaism performed by
Orthodox rabbis.
   Jews in the United States, where the Conservative and Reform
movements are strong, oppose the legislation.

   The Supreme Court today threw out a Kentucky
man's sodomy conviction because he was barred at his trial from
questioning the alleged victim, a white woman, about her living with
a black man.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices overturned the conviction and
10-year prison sentence of James Olden. The court expressed
skepticism about the alleged victim's testimony that she did not
consent to have sex with Olden.
   Olden and a friend, Charlie Ray Harris, were indicted on
kidnapping, rape and forcible sodomy charges.
   Both men, who are black, were accused of forcing a young white
woman to have sex with them after they met her at a bar in
Princeton, Ky.
   The woman initally told police she was raped by four men; later
said she was raped by Olden and Harris, and at trial said Olden was
the sole rapist.
   She also testified at trial that Olden threatened her with a
knife, although in earlier statements to police she did not allege
that he was armed.
   Olden and Harris said the woman consented to having sex with them.
   At the trial, the defendants' lawyers sought to introduce
evidence that the woman was living with another man, Bill Russell,
who is black and a half-brother of Olden.
   The defense lawyers said the woman concocted the story of being
raped to prevent Russell from learning the truth that she consented
to sex with the defendants.
   The trial judge refused to let the defense lawyers question the
woman about whether she was living with Russell.
   The judge said allowing evidence of an inter-racial living
arragnment would have created ``extreme prejudice'' against the
woman.
   Harris was acquitted. Olden was acquitted of kidnapping and rape,
but convicted of forcing the woman to commit sodomy.
   But today the Supreme Court said Olden's right to confront his
accuser was violated by excluding the evidence of the alleged
victim's living arrangement.
   In an unsigned opinion, the court said, ``Speculation as to the
effect of jurors' racial biases cannot justify exclusion of
cross-examination with such strong potential to demonstrate the
falsity of (the alleged victim's) testimony.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall dissented on grounds that the court
should have held formal arguments in the case rather than summarily
reversimg Olden's conviction.
   The case is Olden vs. Kentucky, 88-5223.

   Armed men raided a village near
Botswana's border with South Africa on Monday, killing two people
and burning several huts, a news agency reported.
   Police told the Botswana Press Association they suspected
``elements of the South African Defense Force'' were involved in the
attack on Ditlharapeng village on the Molopo River, which marks the
border between Botswana and South Africa.
   In South Africa, a military spokesman denied the allegation.
   Botswana police said an ``incendiary device'' was used in the
attack, adding that footprints of the attackers were traced back to
the river.
   The raid came four days after two white South Africans captured
in an aborted raid in Botswana were sentenced to 10 years in prison
and eight lashes with a cane. Johannes Basson, 25, and Theodore
Hermansen, 30, were apprehended following a June 20 clash in which
three unarmed Botswana police officers were injured.
   South Africa has staged periodic raids into neighboring countries
in recent years in search of members of the African National
Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting the South African
government. More than a dozen alleged South African agents have been
charged in Botswana and Zimbabwe this year for security-related
offenses.
   Botswana says it is sympathetic to the aims of the guerrilla
group, but that it does not want its territory to be used as a
lauching site for raids into South Africa.

<HEAD>Fed Said Ready to Push Up Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Policymakers at the Federal Reserve, concerned
about renewed signs of inflationary pressures, are poised to drive
interest rates higher in a move that will put the central bank on a
collision course with the incoming Bush administration, private
economists said Monday.
   Many analysts said the Fed has already begun to tighten credit
conditions and they predicted that its Federal Open Market Committee
will vote for more restrictive policies at closed-door strategy
sessions Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Analysts said they based this belief on the fact that recent
economic statistics have pointed to an economy still barreling
ahead, with inflationary pressures rising.
   Unemployment, at 5.4 percent in November, is close to 14-year
lows, leading many economists to worry that tight labor markets and
high factory operating rates will trigger price increases as
production constraints bump up against high demand.
   ``The data on growth and inflation clearly suggest the need for
further tightening,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the
Boston Co. in New York.
   Major banks boosted their prime lending rate two weeks ago to
10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year and the highest level
for this benchmark business and consumer rate since mid-1985.
   Many economists said they were looking for the prime rate to move
up to 11 percent by late January, with similar increases in other
interest rates.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a
government securities dealer, said he expects mortgage rates that
averaged 10.46 percent for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages last week
to climb.
   ``By early next year, I would look for mortgage rates to be
around 11 percent to 11.25 percent and rising,'' he said. ``Mortgage
borrowers should borrow now instead of waiting.''
   Many economists said they were looking for another rise in banks'
prime lending rate, but some said they did not think it would occur
until the Fed hikes its discount rate, a move they predicted would
occur by late January.
   An increase in the discount rate _ the interest the central bank
charges on loans to member commercial banks _ is the most dramatic
signal the Fed can send of its intention to push interest rates
higher as a way of slowing an overheated economy.
   The Fed last hiked the discount rate on Aug. 9, pushing it to 6.5
percent. That move capped a series of less-noticeable credit
tightening steps the central bank had begun in late March.
   The Fed can also influence interest rates by selling U.S.
Treasury securities to banks, reducing the amount of money the banks
have to support their loan activities. This drives up the cost of
those loans, interest rates.
   Many analysts say they have detected signs that the Fed is once
again tightening credit behind the scenes. They note that the
federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for
overnight loans, has been rising. It averaged 8.59 percent last
week, the highest weekly average in two years and up from 8.44
percent the week before.
   Some analysts, however, argued that the rise in the federal funds
rate had occurred because of increased borrowing demand and not from
any overt tightening by the Fed. But regardless of the reason,
analysts said they expected the central bank would go along with the
trend toward higher interest rates in coming weeks.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ``is a gradualist and I
think we will see lots of small steps toward higher rates,'' said
David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. in
Lexington, Mass.
   An effort to fight inflation by boosting interest rates is not
likely to sit well with President-elect Bush, who is counting on
robust economic growth to generate the higher government revenues he
needs to balance the budget without raising taxes.
   Higher interest rates worsen the deficit in two ways. They hold
down economic growth and drive up the federal government's own
borrowing costs. Interest on the $2.6 trillion national debt is now
the third-highest government spending category behind defense and
the programs in the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The Fed is projecting economic growth, as measured by the gross
national product, of around 2 percent to 2.5 percent, far below the
Reagan administration's forecast of 3.5 percent GNP growth next year.
   The Bush administration is likely to adopt the Reagan economic
forecast when it presents its own budget blueprint to Congress
because the higher growth forecast lowers the need for painful
budget cuts to erase the deficit.
   ``I think the Fed believes we are at full employment and we can't
tolerate strong growth any longer and it is time to hit the
brakes,'' Wyss said. ``That means the administration's job in terms
of balancing the budget will be much harder.''
   The Federal Open Market Committee is composed of members of the
Federal Reserve Board and presidents of its regional banks and meets
every six to eight weeks. Its decisions at those private sessions
are not disclosed until after the next meeting is held.

<HEAD>Police Say Drinking Boy Stole Plane, Landed Safely At Busy Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old boy who police say had been
drinking because of family problems took a small plane on a
three-hour flight through some of the nation's busiest airspace
before another pilot talked him down.
   Air traffic controllers and some commercial flights were on alert
Saturday night as the boy, who had only a few hours of flying
instruction, zigged and zagged across major air corridors serving
Newark International, Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports.
   The boy, whose name was withheld because of his age, allegedly
broke into a trailer at Old Bridge Airport in Middlesex County and
took keys to a single-engine Cessna 172, Old Bridge police Sgt.
William Lynch said.
   ``He got the plane off the ground, and I guess nobody noticed
because the airport is closed at night,'' Lynch said. ``It was
pretty good in the dark.''
   The stolen plane went unnoticed until the boy got about 18 miles
away from the Old Bridge airport and began radioing a ``mayday''
distress signal, said Bill Cahill, a spokesman for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and operates the
three major airports.
   The signal was heard all along the mid-Atlantic region's air
traffic facilities, said Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the
Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``The kid is not a pilot, and he allegedly was intoxicated when
he was flying around,'' she said. ``It's not that busy after
midnight on a Saturday and it's a good thing.''
   The boy told police he was having family problems, Lynch said.
   Raymond Malawich, a corporate charter plane pilot heading for
Teterboro Airport, heard the boy's call for help and went in search
of the other plane.
   ``It took 15 minutes to find him,'' Malawich said. ``He was kind
of scared and disoriented.''
   Malawich radioed the boy and told him to follow his tail lights
to Newark International. At one point, the boy lost sight of the
corporate plane and started following another plane toward Linden
Airport.
   ``I picked him up again and took him from there into Newark,''
Malawich said.
   The boy landed safely at Newark at 12:43 a.m. Sunday, with
Malawich talking him through the landing.
   Port Authority police took him into custody and he he failed a
Breathalyzer test, Cahill said.
   The plane was not damaged, Lynch said. The boy was released in
his parents' custody and his case was turned over to juvenile
authorities, who will decide whether to prosecute him on burglary
and theft charges, Lynch said.
   Ms. Bergen said the FAA could press charges of its own.

<TEXT>
   A rail union leader Monday rejected a plan by the
U.S. Guardian Angels group to set up patrols in London's subway
system after two people were fatally stabbed and a third was wounded.
   ``Private individuals are indisciplined,'' said Neil Milligan,
secretary of the 30,000-member Associated Society of Locomotive
Engineers and Firemen. He said police and rail staff should be
increased.
   The latest victim of violence in the Underground was a
29-year-old man who was stabbed with a knife Sunday night during a
fight at London Bridge station. He later had a kidney removed in an
operation Monday.
   Members of the Guardian Angels, who operate in 70 U.S. cities,
said they planned to visit London to train British groups to begin
patrolling the Underground next year. The government opposes the
plan.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd and Transport Secretary Paul Channon
are to meet this week to discuss increasing violence on British
subways and railroads.
   A Turkish visitor, Hakan Koseoglu, 17, was fatally stabbed Friday
in Holborn station after he resisted two muggers who grabbed a gold
chain from his neck. The two were tackled by two other passengers,
but escaped.
   Six hours later, mechanic John Heron, 35, was stabbed at the
Waterloo station during an argument as he stood in line for
information. The assailant escaped and Heron died Saturday.
   Crime on the London Underground has multiplied by 20 times since
1980. This year, 18,383 criminal incidents were reported, subway
officials said.

<HEAD>US, England and Canada to Suspend Low-Level Jet Training Over West
Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, Britain and Canada have
agreed to join West Germany in suspending all low-level jet fighter
training over West Germany for the next three weeks, the Pentagon
announced today.
   The suspension follows last week's fiery crash of a U.S. warplane
in the German city of Remscheid, in which five people were killed
and dozens injured.
   ``The suspension will remain in effect until Jan. 2, 1989, at
which point fighter training will resume,'' the Pentagon said in
releasing a joint communique from the four NATO allies.
   The suspension, ``through the holiday season, (was agreed to) out
of respect for the victims and the families of the victims of the
Remscheid accident, and for Capt. Michael Foster, USAF, and his
family,'' the statement added.
   Foster, 34, of Seal Beach, Calif., was the pilot of the A-10
Thunderbolt II attack jet that crashed in Remscheid, destroying two
dozen homes. The accident occurred on Dec. 8 and immediately
generated new demands in West Germany for curbs on NATO flights.
   The agreement to suspend fighter training until after New Year's
was announced shortly after Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci held
a closed-door meeting with his West German counterpart, Defense
Minister Rupert Scholz, at the Pentagon.
   Neither Scholz nor Carlucci was available after the meeting to
discuss the flight suspension. But Pentagon officials who asked not
to be named said the West German government had asked the United
States to stop military aerial training until after the holidays.
   Scholz previously had told reporters that France, Belgium and The
Netherlands had acceeded to his government's request.

   Bitter-cold Canadian air blanketed much of the nation Monday from
the Northeast and Midwest to the South, contributing to at least
three deaths as temperatures plunged to record lows in two dozen
cities.
   The early deep freeze _ more than a week before the official
onset of winter _ caused water pipes to burst, cars to die and
homeless people to seek warmth in shelters. It also produced
scattered power outages, record power demand and public-transit
delays.
   Greg McGarry, a spokesman for the Albany (N.Y.) Medical Center
Hospital, said he experienced the subzero air fully with his sons on
their morning paper route.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' McGarry said. ``They were dying.''
   Weekend snow and ice were blamed for a dozen traffic fatalities
in the nation's midsection. Snow was falling Monday over parts of
Minnesota and North Dakota. Snow was forecast for Wisconsin, a snow
advisory was in effect for eastern Oklahoma and parts of Arkansas,
and wintry weather was expected in the Carolinas.
   The cold weather was caused by arctic air that flowed across
Canada and into the north-central and northeast United States, said
Hugh Crowther, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's
Severe Storms Center in Kansas City, Mo.
   ``About 25 cities reported record low temperatures this
morning,'' he said Monday.
   Among them were Albany, N.Y., were thermometers dipped to 12
below zero; Allentown, Pa., 2 degrees; Asheville, N.C., 16 degrees;
Baltimore, 12 degrees; Boston, 2 degrees; Detroit, 2 below zero;
Elkins, W.Va., 10 below; Hartford, Conn., 3 below; Houghton Lake,
Mich., 12 below; Newark, N.J., 6 degrees; Philadelphia, 8 degrees;
and Wilmington, Del., 8 degrees. Washington, D.C., tied its record
for the date of 13 degrees.
   Saranac Lake, N.Y., near Lake Placid, had the coldest temperature
in the nation Monday morning, 28 below zero.
   ``It gets colder than this _ sometimes 30 below,'' said resident
Mary LaRose, who said schools were open but village streets were
quieter than usual.
   The bitter temperatures forced the homeless off the streets in
many cities, agencies reported.
   ``We've filled every bed we have. It usually gets worse when the
weather gets colder _ people who normally might not come here show
up because they just can't bear the cold,'' said Edith Richardson,
assistant supervisor of the 113-bed Detroit Rescue Mission.
   In Philadelphia, city workers and police tried to round up
homeless people. In New York City, where the temperature dipped to a
record-low 5 degrees, police took only four homeless people to
shelters late Sunday and early Monday. Three came in voluntarily; a
cold weather alert gave police the authority to move the fourth
against her will, said a department spokesman, Sgt. Maurice Howard.
   Two people in New York apparently didn't make it to a shelter. A
homeless man was found Sunday on a Brooklyn street, apparently
frozen to death, police said. His identity was not known. Also
Sunday, a woman was found dead in an underpass of a subway station,
and police said she may have died from a combination of a drug
overdose and the cold.
   In Baltimore, fire killed a woman in her 60s early Monday in a
house where heat and electricity had been turned off. The woman
apparently was using candles for heat and light, said Fire Capt. Pat
Flynn.
   Also Monday, Baltimore police responding to an anonymous call
found an infant wrapped in a trash bag outside a vacant house. The
boy, believed to be two days to a week old, was reported in good
condition at a hospital.
   ``He had not been there very long. He was warm to the touch,''
said a police spokeswoman, Agent Arlene Jenkins.
   Frozen switches slowed Philadelphia-area commuter trains, and
frozen signals delayed the PATH train system that links northern New
Jersey with Manhattan.
   In Delaware, Delmarva Power and Light Co. said high power demand
hampered its efforts to restore power to about 10,000 customers
after an equipment failure. The cold was a factor in scattered power
outages affecting at least 2,900 customers in Connecticut, Northeast
Utilities said.
   The New England Power Pool, an association of 96 electric
utilities, expected Monday's power useage to set a record. Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp. reported a record-high winter power demand across
New York state.
   In Boston, near-zero temperatures hampered crews trying to shut
down a broken water main that closed a section of a busy artery for
about three hours. Plows were called to clear about eight inches of
slush formed by the thousands of gallons of water.
   In Hartford, Conn., burst pipes forced firefighters to pump water
out of the first floor of the Legislative Office Building.
   In Rochester, N.Y., where the mercury plunged to 8 below, people
with car trouble were calling in record numbers to the Rochester
Auto Club, said club president Charles Gertner.
   More than a foot of snow caused hundreds of weekend traffic
accidents in Ohio, leading to four deaths, authorities said. Wind
whipped up to 2 inches of snow in Kansas, causing hazardous driving
conditions and several fatal accidents that left six dead. Two
highway fatalities in Pennsylvania on Sunday and Monday were blamed
on icy roads.

<HEAD>State Wants To Revoke License Of Driver's Training School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELYRIA, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has threatened to revoke the
license of a drivers' training school that was investigated after a
student driver was involved in a fatal accident in January,
officials said Monday.
   Ohio Highway Director William M. Denihan notified William E.
Keesee, owner of Pro Driving School of Elyria, that he plans to
revoke his license as a driver training instructor and the license
of the company as a school.
   Keesee has 30 days to request a hearing on the state's contention
that the school violated three parts of the Commercial Drivers
Training School Rules that are part of the Ohio Administrative Code,
Highway Safety Department spokeswoman Wendy Schweiger said.
   Pro Driving School's attorney, Gerald Smith, said there was no
basis for the allegations and said the school would request a
hearing.
   Michelle Moore, 18, of Elyria was acquitted of a misdemeanor
charge of vehicular homicide in September in the Jan. 23 death of
Donald Mussey. During her second day of class at Pro Driving School,
Ms. Moore, then 17, skidded her car into a car carrying Mussey. An
instructor was sitting next to her at the time.
   The state notified Keesee of its decision last week after the
Ohio Highway Patrol turned up the alleged violations in an
investigation of the crash.
   ``They are the rules which require that beginning drivers shall
not be given behind-the-wheel training until after they have had two
hours of classroom instruction,'' Ms. Schweiger said.
   The school also is accused of violating a rule outlining the
subject matter to be covered in theoretical instruction and a
record-keeping rule.
   The judge who acquitted Ms. Moore said the teen-ager was poorly
trained and criticized the school for showing the R-rated, Richard
Pryor movie ``Jo Jo Dancer Your Life is Calling'' during the girl's
first class. The movie is loosely based on the comedian's life,
particularly events following a 1980 incident in which he set
himself on fire while smoking cocaine.

<HEAD>Green River TV Show Leads To Arrest Of Two In Separate Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENT, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television special on the Green River serial
killings has led to the arrests of two people in the murder of a
woman whose body was found in the river, police said Monday.
   The killing, however, was believed to be unrelated to the Green
River case, Kent police Sgt. Bob Cline said.
   Authorities on Saturday arrested Michael Hill, 27, and a
17-year-old boy, whose name was withheld, in the Oct. 25 killing of
Alice Cecila Worthing, 25. Ms. Worthing's body was found the next
day in the Green River.
   The arrests were made on the basis of a tip phoned in after last
week's nationwide broadcast of ``Manhunt: A Chance to End the
Nightmare,'' which chronicled police efforts to capture the Green
River killer.
   The Green River killer is officially blamed for the deaths of as
many as 48 young women, many of them prostitutes, between the summer
of 1982 and early 1984.
   Forty are known dead and the Green River Task Force blames the
killer for the disappearances of eight women. The case takes its
name from the river south of Seattle where the first five victims
were found in the summer of 1982.
   Although Ms. Worthing's body was recovered from the Green River,
her death is believed to be unrelated to the serial killings.
   Ms. Worthing, who had brushes with police in connection with drug
and prostitution offenses, was last seen walking in the Holly Park
area of Seattle, Cline said. Her body was found by fishermen. She
had been asphyxiated.
   Cline said he did not know what information was called in, and
further details about the arrests were not immediately available.
   The telephone tip leading to the arrests was among more than
50,000 that have flooded investigators since the television show.
   ``They're still coming in as fast as we can take them,'' King
County Police detective Frank Spence said. He said it would be
months before investigators finish checking out the tips.

<HEAD>Parents Showed Her How To Smoke Cocaine, Daughter Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A father charged with furnishing
cocaine to his 17-year-old daughter said he ``wanted her to be
exposed to it at home,'' police said Monday.
   Victor P. Hupman, 36, and his wife, Patricia, 34, were arrested
Friday on four charges of furnishing cocaine to a minor after their
daughter Stephanie, a student at Los Altos High School, told a
school counselor her parents had a drug problem and were openly
using cocaine.
   Stephanie first saw her parents using cocaine in 1986 and asked
several months ago if she could try the drug, according to police.
   ``She made the inquiries. He offered, she accepted,'' Mountain
View police officer Chris Lindholm said. ``They didn't seek her
out.''
   She told authorities that her father showed her how to cook the
powdered drug into potent, rock-like ``crack'' before smoking a
pipeful with her.
   The high school student tried cocaine four times with her
parents, including twice with crack, police said.
   The teen-ager last took cocaine the night her father took so much
he got sick and thought he was suffering a heart attack, police said.
   ``She was frightened by what she saw and thought it was related
to cocaine,'' said Lt. Gary Smith. ``She said she would never try it
again.''
   She was afraid the drug would kill her parents when she told the
school counselor about their drug use, authorities said.
   The couple surrendered after police interviewed the five Hupman
children, ages 6 to 17, Smith said.
   Police said there is no indication that any other children were
exposed to cocaine at the home in Mountain View, 45 miles southeast
of San Francisco. A search of the family's apartment turned up no
drugs or drug-related paraphernalia, Smith said.
   Victor Hupman, a printer at Stanford University, is scheduled to
be arraigned Dec. 20. Patricia Hupman, a patient relations
specialist at the university, is scheduled to be arraigned later.
They were freed on $25,000 bail Saturday.
   If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of seven years in
prison.
   The Hupman's children have been placed temporarily with Patricia
Hupman's parents in San Jose, Smith said.
   Although the teen-ager wanted her parents to get help, she also
feared that reporting their drug use could break up the family,
Lindholm said. State child abuse laws require school officials to
relay reports of drug use to police.
   ``Her (Stephanie's) attitude was what has to be to be done has to
be done,'' said Lindholm. ``As long as the family was going to get
some help, it was OK.''

   Congested skies and damaged ground facilities
contributed to the fatal crashes of two relief planes to Armenia,
but night flights to the disaster scene will continue, a senior
aviation official said Monday.
   Since Wednesday's devastating earthquake, more than 200 Soviet
relief flights and 38 foreign flights have descended on airports at
Leninakan and Yerevan. They still are streaming to Armenia, with
more to come.
   Early Monday, all seven crew members aboard a Yugoslav military
transport were killed when their Soviet-built An-12 plane crashed
and burned 7{ miles from Yerevan's Zvarnots airport.
   An Il-76 carrying Soviet soldiers to help rescue quake victims
crashed near Leninakan's airport before dawn Sunday, killing all 78
people on board, said Boris Panyukov, deputy director of civil
aviation.
   Snow, rain, and fog have forced air traffic controllers to divert
planes to airports in the neighboring republic of Georgia and
Azerbaijan.
   Panyukov said that weather conditions were normal when the two
planes made their approach. He said both disappeared from the radar
just before they crashed. He provided no details on the reasons for
either crash.
   ``We were obliged to interrupt flights (after the Yugoslav crash)
for two hours ... but we do not see any reason to interrupt night
flights,'' he said.
   ``The situation is difficult taking into account that the density
of flights has increased dramatically,'' he said.
   The quake, which leveled buildings, also affected airport ground
facilities.
   ``There was certain destruction in terms of the airports in
Leninakan and Yerevan. Electricity and energy supplies were cut and
there were difficulties with the airfields,'' he said. But he added
that ``the airfields in Yerevan and Leninakan now meet all standards
for international air traffic.''
   Colin Wheeler, an engineer with the airline Air Europe, said an
Aeroflot aircraft clipped a parked Boeing 707 on Sunday. He said the
accident occurred when the Soviet aircraft taxied behind the Air
Europe plane, which was bringing medical supplies to the stricken
republic. The Air Europe flight later was able to return to London.
   The situation at the Yerevan airport was ``unavoidably chaotic,''
Wheeler said.
   Soviet newspapers contained graphic descriptions of the air
congestion at the mountainous Leninakan airport.
   ``Airplanes were coming into Leninakan literally one after
another,'' the daily newspaper Izvestia said Monday.
   Referring to the two crashes, Izvestia said: ``How were these
losses possible? Because in the air above Yerevan there was such
confusion, just like on the ground.''
   The military newspaper Red Star made similar remarks Sunday
before the crashes.
   ``The sky above Yerevan is overloaded,'' it said. ``There are
always several planes in the air waiting to land. In these
conditions precision is needed and strict coordination of
operations.''

<TEXT>
   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State
Chester Crocker arrived Monday to prepare for the signing of a peace
agreement between South Africa, Cuba and Angola.
   The U.S.-mediated accord will be signed Tuesday, according to
government-run Congo radio.
   Crocker has been the chief mediator in the negotiations, whose
goal is the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola and
independence for the South African-ruled territory of South-West
Africa.
   The negotiations broke off Dec. 3 after the surprise departure of
the South African delegation, which said it needed to consult with
its government on proposals for the verification of the Cuban
withdrawal.
   The Cuban and Angolan delegations accused the South Africans of
bad faith and charged Pretoria was not interested in independence
for South-West Africa, also called Namibia.
   Diplomats have said an interim accord would be signed in
Brazzaville, with a formal treaty to be signed in January at the
United Nations in New York.
   The Cuban delegation was headed by Ricardo de Quessada,
vice-minister for external affairs. The South African and Angolan
delegations were expected Tuesday.

<HEAD>Firebomb Wounds Six in Israeli Bus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A firebomb was hurled at an Israeli bus Monday
in Arab east Jerusalem and the bus crashed into a wall and a parked
car, injuring six people, including an American woman, police said.
   Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip confined 650,000
Palestinians to their homes with an indefinite curfew beginning at 9
p.m.
   Gaza residents said the curfew might be intended to limit
demonstrations during the speech Tuesday to the U.N. General
Assembly in Geneva by Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Libration Organization.
   Shopkeepers in the Gaza Strip closed for a second day to mourn
the deaths of two residents killed Saturday by army gunfire
Saturday. At least 322 Palestinians have died in a year of rebellion
against Israeli rule in the occupied territories, and 11 Israelis
have been slain.
   Police fired tear gas on the grounds of Jerusalem's holiest
mosques after chasing Palestinian high school girls who threw
stones, witnesses said. Three teen-age girls and a boy were reported
arrested.
   Jerusalem police searched for the bomb-thrower, believed to be a
Palestinian. They closed Saladin Street, east Jerusalem's main
commercial thoroughfare, where the attack occurred.
   ``The moment the bottle was thrown, the front windshield of the
bus was covered in fire and smoke,'' said Deputy Police Chief Maod
Halevi. ``The driver kept going until he slammed into a wall and a
car nearby.''
   Among the injured was Salwa Kanana, of Wisconsin, who was seen
lying in an ambulance wearing a neck brace. Hospital officials said
five other passengers were slightly injured.
   Masoud Fadida, a Palestinian from Ramallah homeward bound on the
bus, said: ``We thought the bus was going to turn over, then we
managed to crawl out the back door.''
   The stone-throwing in Jerusalem occurred on Temple Mount,
venerated by both Moslems and Jews and known in Arabic as Haram
al-Sharif (Noble Enclosuree). In the complex are the silver-domed Al
Aqsa and gold-topped Dome of the Rock mosques.
   Several hundred teen-age girls gathered in front of their
religious high school on the grounds, chanting ``Allahu Akhbar!''
(``God is great!'') and throwing rocks at police, both officers and
Arab merchants reported.
   Riot police entered the complex and fired tear gas, said Mohammed
Jamal, a member of the Supreme Islamic Council that administers the
two mosques. Haram al-Sharif is the third holiest site of Islam,
after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
   ``Police shot four canisters inside the school and then they shot
more and more'' but none of the gas entrered the mosques, Jamal said.
   About 50 girls marched to the central bus station in east
Jerusalem, where they began throwing stones and were charged by
mounted police.
   An Associated Press photographer said girls fled into alleys
around the station, pursued by mounted police swinging clubs, and a
girl of about 16 tried to pull one of the officers off his horse.
   Soldiers shot and wounded a 22-year-old Palestinian during a raid
on Salem village in the West Bank near Nablus, said doctors at Al
Ittihad Hospital in Nablus. Troopers began shooting after they were
stoned by villagers who resisted orders to paint over pro-PLO
slogans.
   The army said it had discovered several Palestinian squads that
belonged to Arafat's Fatah guerrilla faction and were suspected of
attacks on soldiers and Israeli civilians.
   A military spokesman said the squads were responsible for a knife
attack on two young Israelis in a Tel Aviv suburb in September 1987
and for planting three bombs aimed at Israeli patrols in the Gaza's
Deir el-Balah refugee camp.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the
states are not enforcing water pollution regulations against 150,000
drinking water sources serving 36 million travelers, workers,
students and others drinking water outside the home, according to an
internal EPA report released Monday by a conservation group.
   Among these sources are those aboard trains, buses and airplanes,
the report said.
   The group, the National Wildlife Federation, said it planned to
sue the EPA over deficiencies in enforcement of the Safe Drinking
Water Act. The federation said it gave EPA the required 60-day
notice of such suits on Monday.
   Such a suit in U.S. District Court would seek an order requiring
EPA to perform duties spelled out in the act, said the federation's
water specialist, Eric Olson.
   The federation released an agency audit of so-called
non-community systems carried out by EPA's inspector general. The
inspector general in 1986 and 1987 checked water enforcement
programs in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia where
an estimated 3 million people were using those systems.
   EPA officials said in the report they believed those four states
were representative of the nation, which has 150,000 non-community
water sources serving 36 million people.
   ``State personnel in West Virginia estimated that 40 percent of
their (non-community systems) were out of compliance,'' the report
said. ``The numbers were similar for Pennsylvania _ 40 percent in
fiscal year 1986 and 29 percent in fiscal year 1987. The Federal
Reporting Data System indicated only 7 percent of the (non-community
systems) in Virginia had monitoring violations in fiscal year 1987.
However, our review revealed that these numbers were substantuially
understated.''
   For coliform bacteria, to be checked every three months unless
otherwise specified by the state, the report said: ``The state of
Maryland estimated that 90 percent of the (non-community systems)
did not comply with federal testing requirements.''
   In the document, EPA officials said the shortcomings were ``a
direct function of EPA's long-standing policy to place priority on
assuring compliance by community water systems.''
   Non-community systems have looser testing requirements than
community systems, but even those were being ignored, the report
said.
   In 1971-1985, the Centers for Disease Control was able to trace
to non-community water systems 45 percent of 484 outbreaks of
diseases carried by drinking water.
   An EPA spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call
seeking comment on the report Monday.
   The EPA comments in the document said the agency planned priority
attention in the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1 for the 20,000
non-community systems serving groups other than travelers, and
``will also consider'' requiring state and regional EPA offices to
meet quotas for enforcement actions.
   A non-community system might be a single well serving a school,
factory, restaurant, motel or campground. More generally, it is any
system serving transients or non-residents, including supplies on
buses, trains and planes even though those might get their water
from public systems.
   Suppliers are supposed to post public notices when testing
discloses a violation of standards, but ``We found only 11 of 826
monitoring violations had evidence of public notification in the
file,'' the auditors wrote. ``State personnel admit that follow-up
on public notification requirements is inadequate.''
   In some violations, repeat testing is required to ensure that a
standard is being met. Out of 145 violations of concentration
standards that were checked, repeat sampling was required in 98, but
``only in two instances did the supplier initiate check sampling
within the required 24 hours. We found no evidence of any check
sampling at all for 28 of the 98 violations. ... In the remaining 68
instances, the supplier delayed the initiation of the check sampling
process for periods ranging from two to 37 days,'' the report said.
   Pennyslvania and Virginia issued notices of violations to
suppliers in only 173 cases out of 371 cases in which notices should
have been issued, and 56 percent of the notices were issued two
months or more after the end of the quarter in which the violation
occurred, the report said.
   Maryland and West Virginia were not reporting what enforcement
actions they took, but the auditors found only seven notices to
suppliers out of 600 violations.
   The states have primary responsiblity for enforcing the federal
law except Indiana and Wyoming, where EPA is directly responsible.
In addition, the agency is directly responsible for enforcement on
Indian reservations and in the District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Ishaq Khan Elected President; Bhutto Wins Confidence Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan easily won
his first full five-year term on Monday, and Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto won her first parliamentary vote of confidence.
   Ms. Bhutto told legislators after her People's Party won 148-55
that Pakistan's destiny does not belong to any one party.
   ``It is the destiny of the entire people of Pakistan. Each one of
us has to shoulder the responsibility,'' she said.
   Earlier, right-wing lawmaker Mohammad Zaheer Khan tried to block
the confidence vote by saying the prophet Mohammed taught that a
woman could not rule Moslems.
   A few minutes later, nearly 73 percent of his colleagues approved
Ms. Bhutto's leadership.
   Her party emerged as the largest single party Nov. 16 in the
country's first free elections in more than a decade. But with 105
seats, it fell short of an outright majority in the 237-seat
legislature.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, since has gained support from several
independents and minor parties, which entitled her to become the
first female prime minister in the Moslem world.
   Under the constitution, the governing party has to pass a vote of
confidence in parliament within 60 days of forming a government.
   Federal Election Commissioner S.A. Nusrat announced on television
that Ishaq Khan, of the Muslim League, swept 78 percent of
presidential votes cast by an electoral college of the Senate,
National Assembly and four provincial assemblies.
   Ms. Bhutto's party and the right-wing opposition alliance, headed
by the Muslim League, both supported Ishaq Khan among the four
presidential candidates, guaranteeing his victory.
   Of 446 valid votes, Ishaq Khan polled 348 compared with 91 to his
nearest rival, veteran politician Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Nusrat
said.
   Ishaq Khan, 78, credited with guiding Pakistan back to democracy
after 11 years of autocratic rule, is to take the oath of office
Tuesday.
   For the last eight years, Pakistan was ruled under martial law by
President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, who died in an Aug. 17 plane crash
that investigators said was probably caused by sabotage.
   Because he was Senate chairman, the presidency passed to Ishaq
Khan, who has nearly 40 years of experience in senior administrative
posts, six of them as finance and commerce minister.
   Pakistan's president holds a largely ceremonial post, but the
roles of both president and prime minister are under debate.
   A 1985 constitutional amendment authored by Zia gives the
president broad but vague discretionary powers.
   Ms. Bhutto has called for a repeal of that amendment, which would
restore supreme political powers to the prime minister as they
existed during her father's 1970s government.
   Zia ousted Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977 and had him executed two
years later for allegedly plotting to overthrow a political foe.

<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers President Richard
Trumka said Monday the Pittston Group has until Jan. 31 to reach a
new contract with 2,000 union members in three states, or face a
strike.
   ``We want to go the last step, the last mile, to see if an
agreement can be reached,'' Trumka said at a news conference called
to announce the start of a media campaign to pressure Pittston to
negotiate. ``But this is one union that has never run from a fight,
and we're prepared to fight this one.''
   But Pittston President Gene Matthis, who has said the company
will continue to operate if the union strikes, said Monday he does
not expect talks to resume soon.
   ``We think it would be most unfortunate if the union would carry
through with this,'' Matthis said. ``It would create a lot of
hardship in some of these communities.''
   Pittston miners in West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky have been
working without a contract for 11 months, since the 1984 national
coal contract expired last Jan. 31. Trumka said there have been no
negotiations since Nov. 9, when Pittston gave the union ``a
take-it-or-leave-it offer.''
   Trumka said the company's offer would weaken safety rights,
eliminate the eight-hour day, increase health care costs and give
the company control of the pension plan.
   Pittston dropped out of the national coal industry bargaining
organization before negotiations began for the 1988 agreement,
saying the company's needs were different than those of the rest of
the industry. The union contends Pittston has demonstrated no
interest in reaching an agreement.
   Matthis said his company's latest offer is better than the
contract the UMW recently signed with A.T. Massey Coal Co., ending a
bitter conflict that began in 1984.
   The campaign announced by the union on Monday will ``increase
pressure against the company on all fronts,'' Trumka said. He said
the UMW is urging other unions and their supporters to withdraw
funds from banks lending money to Pittston.

   The mayors of six U.S. cities named after
biblical sites toured the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Monday to
get a closer look at the Palestinian uprising.
   ``My problems are nothing like this,'' said George Eggert, the
mayor of Bethlehem, Conn., after touring a Palestinian refugee camp.
``I don't have to deal with rocks, bottles and rubber bullets.''
   Eggert and five other U.S. mayors visited the Deheisheh refugee
camp outside Bethlehem as part of a tour of Israel. The visit is
sponsored by the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee, a
pro-Palestinian organization based in Washington.
   Eggert said the mayors came to learn more about the communities
in the occupied territories, where Arabs have been staging a
yearlong uprising against Israel.
   Most of the mayors said the visit has made them more sympathetic
to the Palestinian cause.
   ``I think I'd throw rocks too if somebody took half of my land,''
said Danny Allison, mayor of Palestine, Texas. ``It's a shame we've
allowed this to go unnoticed for so long.''
   Allison said he hoped to get a more balanced view of the
situation later this week, when the group is scheduled to meet with
Israeli officials.
   Ken Rehling, mayor of Hebron, N.D., said he got a first-hand look
at the uprising on Sunday, when Israeli troops fired tear gas into a
crowd of youths demonstrating outside his hotel in Arab East
Jerusalem.
   ``This is definitely a long way from North Dakota,'' he said.
   The other mayors are from Palestine, Ark., Hebron, Ind., and East
Palestine, Ohio.

   Here is the text of the statement issued
by the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth saying that U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins will be executed. It was
translated from Arabic by The Associated Press in Beirut:
   In the name of God, ally of the oppressed,
   To the masses of our oppressed people,
   After the grave confessions made by the American spy William
Higgins, head of the so-called United Nations observer group with
the Israel-Lebanon armistice commission,
   And after these confessions matched identically with our
information,
   And after it has been proven by clearcut evidence that he and his
American team of observers are guilty of providing the Zionist enemy
with accurate and detailed military and security information about
our resistance fighters, their positions, movements, supply routes
and the quantity and quality of their weaponry,
   And after the establishment of the existence of intelligence
coordination between the Zionist enemy and some local factions
through Higgins and his American team,
   And in retaliation for repeated Israeli attacks on our people in
occupied Palestine and the Jebel Amel region and the western Bekaa
(south Lebanon),
   And in revenge for the blood of the martyrs of the latest Israeli
raid in Naameh,
   And as punishment for the United States, the head of terrorism in
the world and the foremost backer with arms, funds and political
coverage of the Zionist aggressions,
   Therefore we announce to the oppressed people of the world that

   Edward Burke, the alderman once considered the
strongest white mayoral candidate, quit the contest Monday and threw
his support behind fellow Democrat Richard M. Daley.
   Daley's entry into the race a week ago doomed Burke's chances,
particularly among white ethnic voters, the source of both men's
strongest support.
   ``I can read the cards as well as anyone else,'' Burke said. ``I
said I would not continue in this race if all indications did not
point to a successful result for me. They do not at this time.''
   Burke made the announcement after recent polls showed Daley, the
Cook County state's attorney and son of legendary Chicago Mayor
Richard J. Daley, leading the field.
   He said he was joining Daley's campaign because ``of the
remaining candidates, he's the one who has the best chance of
winning.''
   Burke, 44, former chairman for the City Council's Finance
Committee, was a leader of council opposition to Mayor Harold
Washington, the city's first black mayor who died in office a year
ago. A special mayoral election will be held April 4. The primary is
scheduled for Feb. 28.
   Burke's withdrawal ``means a clear field for Daley in corraling
the white ethnic vote,'' said Paul Kleppner, director of the Social
Science Research Institute at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb
and a longtime observer of Chicago politics.
   Kleppner predicted a Daley victory unless one of the two leading
black candidates _ Mayor Eugene Sawyer and Alderman Timothy Evans _
decides to drop out.
   If both stay in the race, they likely will split the vote in the
black community and pave the way for a Daley triumph, Kleppner said.
   Burke's announcement came a day after Sawyer said he will seek to
stay in office. Sawyer was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen
last December, after Washington's death.
   The other announced Democratic candidates are Aldermen Timothy
Evans, Lawrence Bloom and Danny Davis, and former state Sen. James
Taylor.
   Former Chicago Parks Superintendent Edmund Kelly withdrew from
the Democratic field Dec. 6, the day after Daley announced his
candidacy.
   Edward Howlett, son of a former Democratic secretary of state, is
the only announced GOP candidate.

Health</HEAD>

   Most family doctors are inadequately trained to
recognize and treat illness that stems from unhealthy environments
at home or work, a National Academy of Sciences panel said Monday.
   But rather than criticizing individual physicians, the report
from the Institute of Medicine committee said the fault lies with
``our highly sophisticated health care system'' in general because
it is not geared toward preventive medicine.
   ``Lacking a solid foundation in occupational and environmental
medicine, as well as in the related disciplines of epidemiology and
toxicology, most primary care physicians are hard-pressed to keep up
with developments in the field,'' the report said. ``Indeed, the
general medical literature contains relatively little about
occupational and environmental medicine.''
   To counter that, the panel's most urgent recommendation was for
establishment of a clearinghouse for doctors to call ``when
confronted with a patient suspected of having an occupational or
environmental disease.''
   ``It should be designed so that a single telephone call satisfies
the practitioner's informational needs,'' the report said. ``It
could be based on an extension of the techniques used by the
nation's poison control centers.''
   The Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of
Sciences, is forming a new advisory committee specifically to draw
up more detailed suggestions for such a clearinghouse.
   On a longer range, the panel that turned in its report Monday
said physician fee schedules should be changed because ``the current
procedure-oriented reimbursement system and the emphasis on
efficiency of practice is antithetical to the desired emphasis on
prevention.''
   Eventually, the committee said, the focus must shift to medical
schools, only half of which have a single faculty member ``primarily
concerned with occupational health.''
   ``Occupational and environmental medicine should be a vital part
of the traditional student clinical assignments,'' the report said.
``Because preventative medicine is usually not taught in the
clinical years, it is necessary that departments of clinical
medicine include occupational and environmental medicine as part of
their third- and fourth-year teaching programs.''
   The report also called for more research into occupational and
environmental medicine.

<TEXT>
   Imprisoned New Jersey mob chief Anthony
``Tony Pro'' Provenzano, a prime suspect in the disappearance of
ex-Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa, died Monday of a heart attack. He was
71.
   Provenzano died at at Lompoc District Hospital, near the federal
prison where he was serving a 20-year term for two racketeering
conspiracy offenses, said Chuck LaRoe, spokesman for the
maximum-security prison 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles. He had
been confined to the hospital for treatment of congestive heart
failure.
   In July 1975, Hoffa disappeared while on his way to a Detroit
meeting with Provenzano, who was then president of Teamsters Local
560 in New Jersey. Hoffa is presumed dead, but his body was never
found.
   According to an FBI memo, Hoffa and Provenzano had feuded when
both were in federal prison. The FBI speculated that Hoffa had hoped
to make peace with Provenzano and forge an alliance that would aid
his drive to regain power.
   New Jersey State Police listed Provenzano as a soldier in the
Genovese crime family who was a close associate of Hoffa in the
early 1960s. The report also said Provenzano and former Genovese
family members were ``primary suspects in Hoffa's disappearance.''
   The Mafia Encyclopedia, written by Carl Sifakis, said Provenzano
was responsible for Hoffa's disappearance.
   ``According to the FBI reconstruction of the Hoffa murder, `Tony
Pro' called the so-called peace parlay with Hoffa and then ordered
him killed. Provenzano denied even being in Detroit at the time, and
seemed to go out of his way to seal an airtight alibi,'' the
encyclopedia said.
   One of Provenzano's Teamster rivals, Local 560 dissident Anthony
Casellito, was garroted with piano wire 23 years ago. The three
Provenzano brothers, Anthony, Salvatore and Nunzio, all have been
imprisoned for a variety of crimes, including racketeering and
extortion.
   Provenzano was installed shop steward in a trucking company in
1945, and by 1950 he was a Teamster organizer and eventually became
president of Local 560. The encyclopedia said he presided over
bookmaking, numbers and loan sharking run by his business agents and
stop stewards.
   LaRoe said Provenzano was sentenced to four years in prison by a
judge in the federal court's Southern District in New York on July
11, 1978, then on July 10, 1979, in the district of New Jersey to
another 20 years.
   ``He had a tentative release date of Aug. 13, 1992, and had
waived parole consideration,'' said LaRoe.
   A resident of Hallendale, Fla., Provenzano began his sentence at
Lompoc on Nov. 18, 1980.

<HEAD>British-born Belgian Teacher Killed in Beirut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gunmen in a speeding car shot to death a
British-born Belgian teacher as he walked through Moslem west Beirut
on Monday, police said.
   They said no motive was apparent for the assassination of Arthur
van Nieuwerburgh, 65, an English teacher at west Beirut's Rashideen
School of Languages and the Moslem-controlled Makassed Cultural
Center.
   His 17-year-old son, Christian, lifted a blood-stained towel
covering his father's face, sobbed, and turned away.
   ``I am very shocked,'' he said later. Christian, who has two
brothers and two sisters living outside Lebanon, said his father had
received no death threats.
   ``We are astonished. We don't believe it is directed at
Belgians,'' said Belgian charge d'affaires Guebert Bioul.
   Bioul said Nieuwerburgh was born in Britain to a British mother
and Belgian father, and the British Embassy confirmed the victim
carried passports of both countries.
   Nieuwerburgh's Japanese wife, restaurateur Suyun Tsuchida, was
abroad but expected to return Tuesday, Bioul said.
   The Belgian was the fifth Western educator to be assassinated in
west Beirut in the last five years and the first since Syrian troops
started policing the city in February 1987.
   Police said Nieuwerburgh was walking from school to his Manara
district home when he was shot by assassins firing silencer-equipped
pistols from a speeding car.
   ``Four bullets pierced his head. Death was instantaneous,'' said
a police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   Witnesses told police they saw three gunmen in the orange Volvo
car the assassins used to escape. The vehicle had no license plates.
   ``He was such a nice man, such a good teacher,'' sobbed one of
his students, who refused to give her name.
   Mrs. Nieuwerburgh's business partner, Rafi Boyadjian, said the
teacher had lived in Beirut since 1968, working first as an
interpreter then switching to teaching in 1975. He spoke Japanese,
French, English and Arabic.
   Friends said Nieuwerburgh tried to set up a memorial fund for two
British teachers kidnapped and murdered in Lebanon in 1986. They
were Philip Padfield, 40, who was director of the privately owned
Rashideen School, and Leigh Douglas, 34, a political science
professor at the American University of Beirut.
   Sixteen kidnapped foreigners are believed held in Lebanon: nine
Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian, a Belgian and a
Swiss.

<TEXT>
   Sales of U.S. Savings Bonds increased for the
second consecutive month in November, rising 7.1 percent to $587
million, the highest level in five months, the government said
Monday.
   The Treasury Department said sales rose $39 million from October
and were up $44 million, or 8.1 percent, from November 1987. It was
the highest total since June, when $615 million in bonds were sold.
   Jerrold B. Speers, executive director of the U.S. Savings Bonds
Division, attributed the increase to a normal seasonal pickup in
purchases for Christmas gifts and to a rise in the market-based rate
on the bonds.
   Effective Nov. 1 through next April 30, bonds held five years or
longer will earn at an annual rate of 7.35 percent for the six
months, up from 6.9 percent the previous six months.
   As of Nov. 30, the total value of savings bonds held by Americans
was $108.9 billion, up 8.9 percent from a year earlier.

   Two Israeli air force planes with supplies for
Armenia's earthquake victims turned around and flew back home Monday
because an Israeli already at their destination told them they were
not needed, officials said.
   The civil defense commander, Maj. Gen. Aharon Vardi, radioed the
pilots to return a few hours after takeoff so they could reorganize
for a relief mission elsewhere in the area devastated by Wednesday's
earthquake, Israeli officials said.
   Vardi came to Armenia on an earlier Israeli relief flight. A
military spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Vardi decided
the planes ``could not be used effectively at the scene'' because
their medical assistance was not needed in Leninaken, one of the
hardest-hit cities in the southern Soviet republic.
   The planes were carrying relief supplies, medical teams and a
field hospital.
   The military spokesman stressed that the Israeli official, not
the Soviet government, made the decision to order the U.S.-made
Hercules airplanes back to Israel.
   He said the aircraft were waiting at Ben Gurion International
Airport in Tel Aviv for orders to return to the Soviet Union. Israel
was waiting for further instructions from Soviet authorities before
sending the planes back, he said.
   When the planes took off Monday, Moscow's top diplomat in Tel
Aviv said the assistance would bring the Israeli and Soviet peoples
closer.
   ``We are greatly moved by this,'' said Georgy Martirosov, head of
the Soviet consular delegation in Tel Aviv, on Israel army radio.
``This help by the Israeli people will bring us closer emotionally.''
   The Soviet Union broke diplomatic ties with Israel during the
1967 Middle East War. But relations have warmed gradually in the
last two years with agreements to exchange low-level diplomats.

<HEAD>US Requests Bodies of Five Americans Killed in Plane Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department on Monday called for the
return of the remains of five Americans who were killed when their
U.S. government relief agency plane was downed in a missile attack
over Mauritania.
   Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said the ``tragic event''
underscored the importance of bringing a peaceful end to conflict in
the Western Sahara.
   The Soviet-armed Polisario Front, which has been fighting a
guerrilla war since 1975 for control of the region, accepted
responsibility for the downing last Thursday of a private DC-7
aircraft under contract to the U.S. Agency for International
Development. The Polisario also apologized and expressed regret.
   Redman withheld judgment until U.S. investigators in Morocco
questioned crew members of a second plane, which landed at Sidi Ifni
after reportedly being hit by missiles.
   Redman said the Americans' only mission was to eradicate locusts
by sparying a pesticide. The planes had been leased from T&G
Aviation of Chandler, Ariz. John Wiliamson, a special assistant to
the AID, said last week they had no connection to any American
intelligence operation.
   ``Our must urgent priority at this time,'' Redman said, ``is the
recovery and return of the remains of our fellow citizens to their
families in the United States. We are in urgent consultation with
all parties who might help in this effort.''
   The U.S. official said the crash site was in a remote area of the
Western Sahara controlled by the Polisario. ``We don't know, at this
point, the exact circumstances.'' Redman said.
   The guerrillas and the Moroccan government have been holding
indirect peace talks under the sponsorship of the United Nations.
Redman appealed for cooperation in the effort.

   Though the town's name evokes images of
palm trees and sunny beaches, the 650 residents of Florida shivered
in air that hit 18 degrees below zero Monday, the coldest
temperature in Massachusetts.
   But townspeople say subzero temperatures are common in the
mountainside community that sits 2,800 feet above sea level, just
500 feet below the state's highest peak, Mount Greylock.
   ``We're just used to coping with stuff like that,'' said Wayne
Boyce, a member of the Board of Selectmen. ``It's not unusual for us
to have snow banks taller than cars.
   ``When Boston gets three or four inches of snow, everybody
panics, nobody can move. We get a couple of inches daily,'' Boyce
boasted. ``That's nothing for us.''
   He said the town in Massachusetts' northwest corner probably was
named after the southern state because Florida ``had a magical sound
to it.''
   ``Probably because of Ponce de Leon and the fountain of youth,''
he said, adding there also are Floridas in neighboring New York and
Vermont.
   Einar Oleson, a former town clerk and member of the local
historical society, also believes the town was been named in honor
of the state, which the nation was considering buying from Spain at
the time of the town's incorporation in 1805.
   Another theory has it that the town was named for the wild
azaleas, called floribunda, that once covered the mountain on which
the community sits, she said.
   Boyce said he rarely hears jokes about the town's moniker, but a
photograph several years ago of a resident holding a snow shovel and
standing next to the frozen highway sign bearing the town's name was
published in several newspapers in the southern state.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed Moslem rebels on Monday
claimed they shot down an Afghan military aircraft, but
Afghanistan's official radio gave a different account and said a
passenger plane was shot down with all 25 people aboard killed.
   Official Radio Kabul charged that a Pakistan air force plane on
Saturday shot down a Soviet-made Antonov-26 airliner as it was
heading toward Kabul, the capital, from the eastern city of Khost,
18 miles from the Pakistan border.
   Pakistani officials denied the allegation.
   Abdul Kabir, a spokesman for the Hezb-e-Islami rebel group, said
guerrillas brought down a military transport plane on Saturday with
a sophisticated, U.S.-supplied anti-aircraft missile.
   Radio Kabul and the rebels, known as mujahedeen, or holy
warriors, presumably were referring to the same incident.
   ``We only know that some government officials and other military
officers were on the plane,'' Kabir said, dismissing Radio Kabul
claims.``Khost is under siege by mujahedeen and only military planes
go there.''
   He said his guerrilla organization probably was the one involved
because it is the strongest in the area and has most of the Stinger
missiles.
   Afghanistan and Pakistan, which signed a U.N.-brokered accord in
April providing for the withdrawal of more than 100,000 Soviet
troops from Afghanistan, often accuse each other of air and missile
attacks.
   Afghan guerrillas based in Pakistan have been fighting Kabul's
communist government for 10 years.
   On Nov. 21, Radio Kabul accused Pakistan of shooting down a
commercial plane that strayed into Pakistani airspace, killing all
27 people aboard.
   Pakistan acknowledged the incident, but identified the plane as a
military transport.
   Pakistan's air force has standing orders to shoot down intruding
Afghan military planes.
   Also on Monday, Radio Kabul said authorities responded to Turkish
appeals and freed two Turks jailed for entering Afghanistan
illegally with rebels.
   It said Turgut Osul and Ottoman Dimirial were released on Sunday.
   Osul was arrested four years ago and sentenced to 16 years.
Dimirial was arrested this year and sentenced to 20 years, the radio
said.

<TEXT>
   The 1988 cotton crop is expected to be at a
seven-year high of 15.2 million bales, up 3 percent from last year's
harvest and 2 percent more than forecast a month ago, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   In a new estimate based on field conditions as of Dec. 1, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said this year's cotton
production would be the largest since 15.6 million bales were
harvested in 1981.
   The report also indicated dry edible bean production this year at
19.1 million hundredweight, down 26 percent from last year, and
burley tobacco production at 459 million pounds, up 9 percent from
the 1987 harvest.
   Orange production, at 215 million boxes, is up 9 percent from
last season but about 1 percent shy of 1987-88 production.
   The report did not include new 1988 production figures for other
major crops such as wheat, corn and soybeans. An annual report on
this year's producton of those commodities will be issued Jan. 13.
   Planting of winter wheat for the 1989 harvest was 95 percent
completed by Nov. 1, about 5 percentage points ahead of average, the
report said. But lack of moisture hampered development in much of
the major growing areas.
   ``Near the end of the month, rain and snow provided needed
moisture in portions of the plains and Pacific Northwest,'' the
report said. ``Greenbugs continued to be a problem in Kansas and
Texas. In Texas, central and southern areas remained dry and showed
little or no growth.''

   Police shot and killed six poachers who had
slaughtered 10 elephants last week, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Coast Provincial Commissioner Simeon Mung'ala said the six opened
fire first during the shootout in Tsavo National Park, according to
the Daily Nation.
   Police recovered 19 elephant tusks from the park, about 220 miles
southeast of Nairobi, he said.
   The deaths brought to 11 the number of suspected poachers killed
since August, when authorities launched a crackdown after 92
elephants were slaughtered in four months, the Kenya Times said.
   The Nairobi-based U.N. Environmental Program said Kenya's
elephant population has fallen by 85 percent in the past 15 years,
and less than 5,500 elephants remain in the Tsavo area.
   Experts blame the slaughter on an all-time high in ivory prices,
which average $82 a pound.

<TEXT>
   More than half the countries in the United
Nations still hold ``prisoners of conscience'' 40 years after the
U.N. declaration of human rights, Amnesty International charged on
Monday.
   The United Nations now has 159 member states.
   ``Torture done with methods that equal anything the Nazis devised
is practiced systemically in more than one-third of the world's
nations,'' Deputy Director Curt Goering of Amnesty International
said.
   Goering, an American born in Kansas, said ``It is all systems of
government that are at fault. Dictatorships as well as democracies,
countries with military rule as well as civilian rule, countries
with free elections and countries with no elections.''
   He spoke to the Washington chapter of the United Nations
Association at a meeting to mark the 40th anniversary of the U.N.
Declaration of Human Rights on Dec. 10, 1948. Goering said the past
week had seen the discovery of graves of political prisoners in Iran
and, in Paraguay, dozens of people were arrested demonstrating for
human rights.
   ``Today in countries from South Africa to Vietnam, from Uganda to
Israel, thousands upon thousands of political prisoners languish,
uncharged and untried, in filthy and overcrowded prison cells, in
mountains and in deserts, beaten, humiliated and isolated,'' he said.
   He cited three specific cases:
   _Ali Ardalan, arrested in Iran in May for asking an end to the
war with Iraq, held incommunicado, whereabouts unknown. There has
been a cease-fire in the war since August.
   _Vazif Meylanov, 49 years old, arrested Jan. 25, 1980 and
imprisoned in the Soviet Union for demonstrating against the
internal exile of Andrei Sakharov. Sakharov was freed and recently
visited the United States.
   _Ma'ruf Abdullah Fatah, 27, arrested in Iraq on suspicion of
organizing a banned political party. Goering said Fatah tortured by
having his head enveloped in a hood filled with flying ants and went
insane.
   Goering denied that Amnesty, an international private
organization, has any ideological interest, saying it had been
called communist by the government of Guatemala and accused by the
communist government of Afghanistan of being in league with the
Voice of America.
   ``We frankly don't care whether the government is torturing
someone in the name of the revolution, or in the name of fighting
the revolution, or in the name of restoring order so that democracy
might flourish,'' he said.
   ``All we care about is that the torture stop.''

   Army Col. Roger H.C. Donlon, the first
serviceman to win a Medal of Honor for valor during the Vietnam War,
will retire later this week after 32 years of military service, the
Pentagon announced Monday.
   Donlon was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Johnson during
a White House ceremony on Dec. 5, 1964, in recognition of his
bravery in repulsing a Viet Cong attack at Nam Dong on July 6, 1964.
   Donlon, who is the alternate-president of the Army's Physical
Evaluation Board at the Presidio of San Francisco, will retire
during ceremonies scheduled Wednesday morning at Fort Leavenworth,
Kan., the Pentagon said.
   ``He and his wife, Norma, will reside in Leavenworth,'' the
Pentagon added.
   Besides the Medal of Honor, Donlon also has won the Bronze Star,
the Meritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Joint
Service Commendation Medal and a Purple Heart.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, the House Banking
chairman who lost his re-election bid in the wake of investigations
into his relationships with industry lobbyists, is contemplating a
Washington lobbying position, an aide said Monday.
   ``He's talking with some people about setting up a Washington
office,'' said Rick Maurano, a top aide to the Rhode Island Democrat.
   Maurano said he knew only that the talks were with a Rhode Island
law firm that wants to create a Washington office for lobbying
activities.
   St Germain could not be reached for comment. There was no answer
Monday afternoon at his Rhode Island home.
   A bill passed by Congress late in the legislative session would
have prohibited St Germain and other members of Congress from
lobbying their ex-colleagues for one year after leaving office. But
President Reagan killed the measure late last month.
   St Germain, 60, who has represented eastern Rhode Island's
largely Democratic 1st Congressional District since 1961, lost his
bid for a 15th term in November to Republican newcomer Ronald K.
Machtley. St Germain's loss was attributed largely to a series of
government investigations surrounding allegations that the
congressman benefitted financially from his committee post.

   The former president of this west

   The report gave no details on the release of Lt. Col. Mohamed
Khouna Ould Haidalla and five officers of his Military Committee for

   None of the six was criminally charged since they were ordered
imprisoned by President Lt. Col. Maayouia Ouls Sid'Ahmed Taya,

Haidalla took power in 1979 following a series of coups.

<HEAD>Kellogg Takes Tropical Oil Out of Cracklin' Oat Bran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. said Monday it has stopped
using tropical oil in its Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal, eliminating an
unwanted dose of saturated fat for consumers who buy the cereal for
cholesterol-lowering bran.
   ``I'm elated,'' said Phil Sokolof, founder of National Heart
Savers, a Nebraska organization that has campaigned against products
which use tropical oils, such as palm and coconut.
   ``Thousands of ounces of coconut oil will no longer be clogging
the arteries of America'' as a result of Kellogg's action, he said.
   Oat bran helps keep down cholesterol, while saturated fat can
boost it. People who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher
risk of a clogging of the arteries that can lead to heart attacks.
   Joseph Stewart, senior vice president for Kellogg's corporate
affairs, told Sokolof in a letter that the company was taking
coconut oil out of the cereal. He said the new product will be on
grocery shelves within three months.
   Stewart said Monday that Kellogg had been working on a new
formula for Cracklin' Oat Bran because the cereal maker sensed
growing public sentiment against use of tropical oils.
   ``We don't want to lose it (consumer confidence) over confusion
about one product out of 40,'' he said, adding other Kellogg
products don't contain the tropical oils.
   Kellogg replaced the coconut oil in Cracklin' Oat Bran with a
combination of cottonseed and soybean oils that eliminates the
saturated fat content.
   In addition to Kellogg, Pepperidge Farm earlier said it was
taking tropical oil out of its breads with plans for removing it
from cookies, and Sunshine Biscuits Inc. said it was taking tropical
oils out of its cookie products, Sokolof said.
   Sokolof said coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat
than lard.
   Coconut and palm oil are popular because they contribute to the
shelf life of food products, Sokolof said. Many products advertised
as being free of cholesterol contain tropical oils that can help
cholesterol form after consumption, he said.
   ``When they say `No cholesterol' on a product ... it may be fine,
but it may contain highly saturated palm and coconut oils,'' Sokolof
said.
   National Heart Savers plans $140,000 worth of ads Tuesday in the
Wall Street Journal and USA Today, citing other products it says are
high in palm and coconut oils.
   The products to be cited Tuesday are Nabisco Triscuit crackers
and striped Chips Ahoy cookies; Post Fruit & Fibre cereal;
Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers; Keebler Club crackers; Quaker
Chewy Granola Bars; Borden Cremora creamer; Carnation Coffeemate;
Birdseye Cool Whip topping; and Procter & Gamble Crisco. All but the
granola bars and Chips Ahoy cookies were cited previously, Sokolof
said.
   ``These are the ones that people eat and don't realize what
they're consuming,'' Sokolof said.

   He made the trip aboard a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport,
accompanied by his wife, Venetia; Dr. Edgar Weithers, the consulting

   Charges should be filed against the
``scrap-builders'' of shoddily constructed buildings deatroyed by
the earthquake that killed more than 50,000 people in Soviet
Armenia, Pravda said Monday.
   The Communist Party newspaper recommended the action in a
scathing artlcle about apartment buildings in the devastated region
that crumbled into ``concrete and metal graves over victims who were
buried alive.''
   ``In fragments of concrete panels, it is impossible to know
whether there is more sand or more cement,'' it said of the wreckage
in Leninakan, a city of 250,000 where more than three-quarters of
the buildings fell.
   ``It is time to answer the question, how many criminal cases were
filed against the scrap-builders and what was the outcome?'' Pravda
asked. ``Who closed their eyes to the warnings of the seismologists,
here and in other regions?''
   All construction in the Soviet Union is handled by government
agencies.
   American earthquake experts have said a quake of the same
strength would have killed only 1,000 people in heavily populated
Southern California because of the difference in building techniques.
   Concrete-slab apartment buildings were hastily built throughout
the Soviet Union in the past 20 years to ease a chronic housing
shortage.
   The Kremlin has sent a commission to Leninakan to determine why
so many buildings disintegrated in an area where where builders
supposedly used construction techniques designed to survive quakes.
Authorities have said the temblor last Wednesday was stronger than
expected in northwestern Armenia.
   Photos of the ruins show entire sections of high-rise residential
buildings sheared off, with no evidence of steel reinforcing bars at
stress points as required in Western countries.
   ``If the construction of the buildings was better, maybe less
would have been destroyed,'' Leonid Bibin, deputy chief of Soviet
construction, told a news briefing Monday.
   A broken slab on which was writtren ``This piece of concrete is
not to be used,'' lay in the rubble Monday in Leninakan. Short
supply is common in Soviet industry and workers often use the
defective or makeshift to finish projects.
   Bibin said the earth shook vertically during the quake, causing
buildings constructed of concrete slabs to collapse. He also said
the earth was soft in some areas.
   ``Why did buildings from three years ago collapse while those of
three or five stories built under (former leader Nikita) Khrushchev
are still standing?'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev demanded on
television Sunday night.
   In Leninakan, older low-rise apartment blocks stood unscathed
while ``everything built in the years of stagnation collapsed,''
Pravda said, using the Soviet term for the regime of the late Leonid
I. Brezhnev.
   ``Geophysicists more than once warned builders of the high
seismic activity in northwest Armenia, but stubbornly they continued
to raise five- to nine-story buildings,'' the paper said.
   Acccording to Bibin, every building more than five stories high
collapsed.
   Kagik Avakyan, a resident of Leninakan, told The Associated Press
the city had no buildings taller than two stories until 20 years ago
because of the threat of earthquakes.

   Israel's highest ranking counterterrorism
official alleged on Monday that PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat had
direct involvement in 10 terror attacks in Israel and abroad.
   Yigal Carmon, special adviser on terrorism to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, told a news conference Arafat was involved through
``approval of plans, issuing orders and allocating the funds
necessary for the special operations.''
   ``There are other types of involvement, but I cannot specify,''
he added.
   The 10 acts Carmon listed ranged from the July 1987 assassination
in London of Palestinian cartoonist Naji al-Ali, known for his
anti-Arafat drawings, to the April 1986 bombing of a TWA jetliner
over Greece which killed four people.
   Carmon gave no specifics and would not say how Israeli officials
concluded Arafat was personally linked to the incidents.
   His remarks came at a government-sponsored briefing held to
counter claims by Arafat that the Palestine Liberation Organization
has accepted Israel and renounced the use of terrorism.
   A group of nine dovish Labor Party legislators published a
statement Monday saying they would endorse peace talks with the PLO
if the PLO followed up its acceptance of Israel with a renunciation
of terrorism.
   The statement appeared in leading newspapers and was seen as a
significant shift in the thinking of mainstream politicians.
Supporters included Yossi Beilin, a former senior aide to Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres.
   It said that ``prospects of opening negotiations with this
Palestinian leadership'' have been brought closer, but that
``without an unequivocal decision to renounce terror and stopping
it, there will be no negotiations.''
   The PLO condemned terror but said the organization will continue
armed operations in Israeli-held territory.

<HEAD>Three Allies Suspend Low-Level Flights Over West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, Britain and Canada on Monday
agreed to suspend all low-level military jet training over West
Germany for the next three weeks ``out of respect for the victims''
of a fiery crash last week.
   The suspension, requested by the West German government after the
Dec. 8 accident at Remscheid, will block military flight training
below altitudes of roughly 10,700 feet.
   ``The suspension will remain in effect until Jan. 2, 1989, at
which point fighter training will resume,'' the Pentagon added in
releasing a joint communique from the four NATO allies.
   In a related matter, the U.S. Air Force on Monday denied
newspaper reports that American soldiers used force to keep local
residents and a news reporter away from the scene of last week's
crash.
   The accident involved an Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II jet that
slammed into a residential neighborhood in Remscheid, killing the
pilot and five others on the ground and igniting a huge blaze that
destroyed two dozen homes.
   Some West German officials have charged that American authorities
mishandled the rescue efforts and delayed releasing information.
   The suspension of low-level training, ``through the holiday
season (was agreed to) out of respect for the victims and the
families of the victims of the Remscheid accident, and for Capt.
Michael Foster, USAF, and his family,'' the communique stated.
   Foster, 34, of Seal Beach, Calif., was the pilot of the A-10. The
accident immediately generated fresh demands in West Germany for
curbs on training flights by North Atlantic Treaty Organization air
forces.
   The flight suspension was announced shortly after Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci met behind closed doors at the Pentagon
with his West German counterpart, Defense Minister Rupert Scholz.
   Neither Scholz nor Carlucci were available after the meeting to
discuss the matter. Scholz previously had said that France, Belgium
and the Netherlands had agreed to his government's request.
   On any given day in West Germany, the sky is filled with hundreds
of jets and helicopters, leading to public opposition that has been
fueled by recent tragedies.
   Even before last week's fatal crash, 12 major accidents of
military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone. They
included 70 who died from an air show crash in Ramstein in August.
   Allied military authorities ordered a temporary suspension of
low-level training missions immediately after the Remscheid crash,
only to see opposition West German political parties call for an
outright ban on low-level flights and sharp cuts in air excercises.
   A Pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be named said
there was a serious concern about honoring Germany's request
``because we don't want to set any big precedent and we don't want
to reduce our pilot proficiency standards.''
   In the end, however, U.S. officials concluded they could not
ignore a request from the West German government ``that was limited
to a reasonable period of time,'' the source added.
   The Pentagon, following Scholz's departure, declined to elaborate
publicly on the brief, two-sentence communique.

   Space shuttle Atlantis arrived here Monday
atop a modified jumbo jet for an overnight stay on its hopscotch
journey back to its Florida launch site.
   The shuttle, which arrived at Kelly Air Force Base at 2:30 p.m.
CST from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson, Ariz., was to
continue its journey to the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral,
Fla., between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. Tuesday, said Kelly spokeswoman
Phebe Brown.
   Atlantis, which returned last week from a classified military
mission, left Edwards Air Force Base in California at 3:27 p.m.
Sunday, carried piggypack atop a Boeing 747 and stopped for the
night at the Arizona base.
   Weather along much of Atlantis' route back to Florida has been
stormy, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials
are concerned that flying through rain could damage the thousands of
ceramic tiles on the shuttle's belly. The tiles ward off the extreme
heat of re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.
   Ms. Brown said an air-conditioning, heating and filtering unit
was flown from Davis-Monthan and would be hooked to the shuttle for
its overnight stay in Texas. The unit maintains the temperature and
filters the air inside the orbiter, she said.
   Atlantis landed at Edwards after a four-day secret mission that
reportedly included deployment of a military spy satellite. It was
the second shuttle flight since missions resumed following the 1986
Challenger disaster, which claimed the lives of seven astronauts.

   The Agriculture Department said Monday it has
formally adopted a rule change that lets processors use certain
acidic substances to keep supermarket pork chops looking pink and
appetizing.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service, said the agency has permitted use of the
additives since September 1986 but also reserved making a final
decision until public comments had been submitted.
   The substances are ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid,
sodium ascorbate and sodium citrate, which are used in fresh cuts of
pork to maintain the meat's color.
   ``The use of these substances in the product does not pose a
health risk,'' Crawford said. ``Fresh pork loses its color long
before it becomes unsafe. The color change makes the product
unappealing.''
   Product labels will identify the added substances and the reason
for their use, he said, for example: ``Sprayed with a solution of
water, ascorbic acid and citric acid to maintain color.''

   U.S. drug companies, tutored by recent
disasters in the Caribbean, Mexico and Bangladesh, prepared Monday
to send antibiotics, bandages and other medical supplies to tens of
thousands of earthquake victims in Soviet Armenia.
   The manufacturers were working through a network of donor
churches, a Connecticut relief agency and their own foreign offices,
company officials said.
   The earthquake last week killed up to 60,000 people, leaving half
a million homeless and the threat of infection and disease.
   At Hoffmann-La Roche, where two regional sales managers are of
Armenian descent, the effort has taken on special meaning.
   ``It really brings it down to a personal level, knowing these
people have relatives there,'' said Kassy McGourty, a spokeswoman
for the Nutley-based pharmaceutical company.
   She said workers were preparing a tractor-trailer load of
antibiotics, enough to treat 2,000 to 3,000 people _ the company's
largest shipment ever.
   The drugs were to be routed by Interchurch Medical Assistance
Inc., a New Windsor, Md.-based umbrella group for church missions
and denominational relief agencies.
   ``We've had all these emergency shipments to the point where
we're down to the bottom of the barrel of supplies,'' said the
organization's associate director, Paul Maxey.
   IMA issued an urgent appeal to drug companies for Armenia after
this year's earthquake in Mexico City, floods in Bangladesh and a
hurricane in Jamaica, Maxey said.
   He said 107,000 pounds of medical supplies are ready to be
shipped.
   Johnson & Johnson sent $500,000 worth of sutures, disinfectants,
dressings, bandages and other products in a shipment Saturday sent
by AmeriCares Foundation Inc., a New Canaan, Conn.-based relief
agency, said Johnson & Johnson spokesman Ed Watson.
   Another load was due to leave Tuesday from Seattle with the
Seattle-King County Disaster Team. The shipment was enough to supply
four field hospitals for several days, Watson said.
   Lederle Laboratories, a division of American Cyanamid, is waiting
to hear from AmeriCares about when to forward antibiotics, said
spokesman Robert Schwadron in Wayne.
   ``We respond when these disasters take place,'' he said. ``You
have to. You have to be compassionate.''
   Spokeswoman Peggy Ballman at Princeton-based Squibb Corp. said
the company had decided to send supplies directly through its London
office. A meeting with Soviet health officials and the operations
director for Eastern Europe is scheduled for Wednesday, she said.
   On Sunday night, Merck & Co. Inc. of Rahway sent 1 million
penicillin tablets from its division in Montreal, said spokeswoman
Cindy Zarski. Merck planned to send 4,900 vials of surgical
antibiotics Tuesday evening, she said, and was prepared to send
1,000 vials of hepatitis antibodies if needed.
   Ron Asinari, a spokesman for Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison,
said the company was still developing plans for assistance.

   A key congressman said Monday he wants an
investigation into Navy computer contracts in the wake of a ruling
by a federal appeals board that specifications for a series of
contracts had favored International Business Machines Corp.
   ``In the next two years, Congress will play an important role in
the defense procurement question and with shrinking budgets, it is
important that we get the most for our defense dollars,'' said Rep.
James Florio, D-N.J.
   Florio is chairman of the Energy and Commerce consumer protection
subcommittee.
   Speaking by telephone from his New Jersey office, Florio said he
has asked the General Accounting Office to investigate in the wake
of last week's decision by the General Services Administration's
board of contract appeals.
   The board ruled in a case involving a $150 million computer
contract. IBM competitors had complained, charging that the Navy's
specifications for the contract unfairly favored the giant company.
   In the ruling, Judge Robert W. Parker concluded that the Navy
contract ``solicitation provides for less than full and open
competition and that the Navy has not properly justified such a
restriction on competition.''
   Telephone calls seeking comment were not returned Monday by Navy
officials.
   The case involves a Navy contract to purchase about 20 computer
systems for 14 different data centers and facilities. The 10-year
contract also includes training and technical support. The
specifications were issued more than a year ago.
   The Navy argued that using a single contractor would have
technical and administrative advantages and suggested that using
more than one source would mean non-compatible computers.
   The protest to the GSA board was filed by PacifiCorp. Inc. of
McLean, Va., one of the companies seeking to bid.
   Florio said he wanted the GAO, the congressional watchdog agency,
``to investigate the process under which the Navy has apparently
violated federal procurement rules.''

   The creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, one of the hottest-selling Christmas toys, know what little
boys want.
   ``Kids are into slime,'' said David Valentine, a toy industry
analyst for Standard & Poors. ``Anything to gross out their little
sisters.''
   The four turtles wielding Ninja weapons have hit No. 11 in the
Toy & Hobby World charts of best sellers just four years after they
were conceived by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman during a
late-evening diet of ``horrible'' television.
   ``It's insane,'' said Eastman, 26. ``Pete and I really had no
idea what we were unleashing. We were just two wild-eyed kids who
just wanted to do comic books.''
   Eastman, then an occasional student at the University of
Massachusetts, said he tracked down Laird, who scraped out a living
by drawing illustrations for local newspapers, in 1982 because their
cartoons looked alike.
   The turtles were created after what Eastman called a heavy dose
of ``T.J. Hooker'' and ``Love Boat'' at an apartment the two men
shared while Laird was still free-lancing cartoons and Eastman got
by making sandwiches at a restaurant.
   ``We had been watching a bunch of horrible TV and we started
drawing and throwing the stuff at each other,'' Eastman said last
week. ``We found we had this little beastie that we really fell in
love with.''
   The beast soon had three brothers, all named after Renaissance
artists, and a weird history involving a pool of goo in a New York
sewer and a rat with the powers of a Ninja master.
   Their creators scraped together $1,200 and printed 3,000 copies
of the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic book. The comics
sold out in three weeks and Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo and
Raphael were propelled to fame on T-shirts, cereal boxes and
Saturday morning TV.
   Even avid fan Tom Selleck was filmed reading a turtles comic in
the farewell episode of ``Magnum, P.I.''

<HEAD>Rep. Dan Coats, a Former Aide, Gets Quayle's Senate Seat</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates thruout with Coats, Quayle, Lugar news conference</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Coats, who got his start in politics
as an aide to Dan Quayle, was named Monday to take the vice
president-elect's seat in the Senate.
   ``I believe in providence,'' said Coats, the Indiana Republican
who had succeeded his boss in the House eight years earlier when
Quayle moved up to the Senate.
   Coats, 45, had won re-election to a fifth House term on Nov. 8,
the same day Quayle won the vice presidency as George Bush's running
mate.
   Indiana Gov. Robert Orr announced Coats' name at a news
conference in Indianapolis, saying he ``represents values near and
dear to the people of Indiana.''
   Quayle, appearing with Coats on Capitol Hill, praised the
Republican congressman as a dedicated family man and trusted friend.
But he turned aside suggestions that Coats was his hand-picked
successor.
   ``This was a one-man vote. The governor made the decision. ... I
did not make any specific recommendation,'' Quayle said.
   Coats thanked Quayle, Orr, and Indiana's senior senator,
Republican Richard Lugar, for their support and promised great
efforts on behalf of his Indiana constituents.
   ``I realize I'm not their elected senator. I'm their appointed
senator. I hope over the next two years to work my very hardest to
earn their respect and support,'' he said.
   He will serve until a special election in 1990, when voters will
decide whether he or someone else should fill the last two years of
Quayle's term. An election for a full six-year Senate term will be
in 1992.
   In response to a reporter's question about the coincidence of
twice following Quayle into elected posts, Coats replied, ``I
believe in providence, rather than fate. However that House seat was
a hotly contested seat in 1980 ... I hope that I earned that seat in
1980 and in the subsequent eight years demonstrated my ability to do
the job.''
   He had worked in Quayle's congressional office in Fort Wayne,
Ind., from 1976 to 1980.
   Orr said Coats had ``the ability, the intellect, the character
and the temperament to be an outstanding United States senator,'' a
thought echoed by Lugar.
   ``He is a remarkable legislator, a remarkable campaigner, but
even more importantly, a decent human being,'' Lugar said.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole issued a statement welcoming
Coats to the Senate and saying he was confident Coats would
``continue to represent the people of Indiana with vigor and
commmitment to their heartland values.''
   In the House, the low-key Coats has compiled a conservative
record that drew an 82 percent approval rating in 1986 from the
American Conservative Union.
   He is a supporter of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and to the
Angolan rebels. In 1984, he attempted to attach to an education bill
an amendment to cut off federal aid to schools and states banning
voluntary school prayer. The amendment was defeated.
   In selecting Coats, Orr cited his ``very fine electoral record''
in five House elections and an ability to build a strong base to
withstand a Democratic challenge. Coats has never received less than
61 percent of the vote in his northeastern Indiana district. Last
month he won re-election with 62 percent.
   His selection makes no change in the Democratic-Republican split
in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the new
Congress.
   Quayle has announced he will resign, probably effective Jan. 2,
to allow his successor to gain seniority by being sworn in before
the rest of the Senate on Jan. 3. However, Coats said he expected to
be sworn in with the rest of the Senate.
   Several other names had been mentioned as potential candidates
for Quayle's seat, including former White House political director
Mitchell Daniels and Quayle's wife, Marilyn. Both took themselves
out of contention several weeks ago.
   Quayle said his wife was ``very gratified'' with Orr's decision.
   Coats was born in Jackson, Mich., graduated from Wheaton College
and then served in the Army. Like Quayle, he got his law degree at
Indiana University in Indianapolis.
   He worked as assistant vice president and legal counsel for
Mutual Security Life Insurance Co. before going to work for
then-Rep. Quayle.

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari chose his
predecessor's treasury secretary as ambassador to Washington on
Monday, another sign of his desire to alter the terms of Mexico's
huge foreign debt.
   An announcement from the Foreign Ministry said Gustavo
Petriccioli, who has a master's degree in economics from Yale, will
replace Jorge Espinosa de los Reyes.
   Salinas, who began his six-year term Dec. 1, has said
renegotiating terms of the $102 billion foreign debt leads his
priority list, and he discussed it with President-elect George Bush
at their meeting in Houston last month.
   As Treasury Secretary for the last two years of de la Madrid's
term, Petriccioli sought a postponement of debt payments because of
the financial squeeze caused by the collapse of world oil prices in
the early 1980s.
   He negotiated an an agreement with creditor banks signed March
21, 1987, that included $7.7 billion in new loans, restructured
$43.7 billion of the debt and decreased interest rates on $8.6
billion loaned in 1983-84.
   Petriccioli, 60, also worked out Mexico's purchase of several
billion dollars worth of its foreign debt certificates at discount
rates this year and helped enforce a ``solidarity pact'' of
government, business and labor that helped lower annual inflation
from 150.9 percent in 1987 to about 48 percent in 1988.
   By keeping interest rates high and the peso's value virtually
steady against the dollar, Petriccioli also managed to accumulate an
all-time record of $16 billion in foreign currency reserves last
year.
   Salinas has promised to lighten the burden of austerity economics
on average Mexicans, whose real wages have been cut in half during
the past six years.
   Salinas has noted Mexico's economic growth remained near zero
during that period and said renegotiating debt payments is vital to
provide money for industrial development.
   Foreign creditors have balked at Mexico's proposals to reduce the
$13 billion it is paying in debt service this year. Debt service
payments for next year are estimated at $16 billion.

   Michigan Democratic chairman Richard Wiener
picked up endorsements from 13 party leaders from Western states on
Monday in his bid to win election as Democratic national chairman.
   Wiener was backed by state chairmen from California, Oregon,
Arizona, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Nevada, as well as
several vice chairmen.
   ``We believe that our next national chair must be a proven party
builder and mount broad support throughout the Western part of the
United States _ a region where we have great potential to expand our
Democratic base over the next four years,'' the officials said in a
statement.
   The endorsements reflect a natural base for Wiener, outgoing
chairman of the Association of Democratic State Chairs.
   Wiener announced his support as former Oklahoma Rep. Jim Jones
spread the word he would make an announcement Wednesday about the
race to succeed outgoing party chairman Paul Kirk. Jones, a
Washington lawyer, said last week he was considering running.
   Other contenders include Ronald H. Brown, who claims the support
of roughly 60 percent of the votes needed to win election at the
Democratic National Committee meeting Feb. 9 and 10. Brown, a
longtime party activist who was convention manager for Democratic
presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson last summer, was endorsed last
week by Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   Former Reps. Michael Barnes of Maryland and James Stanton of Ohio
are other contenders.

<TEXT>
   Journalist Loudon Snowden Wainwright, who wrote
Life magazine's ``The View From Here'' column and chronicled the
magazine's history in a 1986 book, died Monday of cancer at age 63.
   After serving in the Marines and graduating from college,
Wainwright joined Life in 1949 as an office boy. In the 1950s he
distinguished himself as a reporter, correspondent, bureau chief and
staff writer.
   He was later known for his close relationship with the Mercury
astronauts and wrote their personal accounts of their missions for
Life.
   Wainwright started ``The View From Here,'' the magazine's first
personal column, in 1964 and, despite interruptions, was writing it
up until his death.
   In 1969, Wainwright was named Life's assistant managing editor
and held that position until the weekly ceased publication at the
end of 1972. He rejoined the writing staff for Life's revival as a
monthly in 1978.
   In 1986, Knopf published Wainwright's ``The Great American
Magazine,'' which tells the history of Life from an insider's
viewpoint.
   A memorial will be held in January.
   Wainwright is survived by his wife Martha, from whom he has been
separated for more than a decade, and their four children. A son,
Loudon Wainwright III of New York City, is a well-known folk-rock
singer and songwriter.
   He is also survived by his longtime companion, Martha Fay, and
their 6-year-old daughter.

<HEAD>US Renews Appeal To Arafat To Renounce Terrorism, Accept Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration renewed its offer
Monday of a ``substantive dialogue'' if Yasser Arafat, the chairman
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, explictly recognized
Israel and renounced terrorism.
   The offer was made by the State Department on the eve of Arafat's
arrival in Geneva for a U.N. General Assembly debate on the conflict
between Israel and Palestinian Arabs. The session was shifted to the
Swiss city after Secretary of State George P. Shultz blocked a visa
for Arafat to speak in New York.
   Shultz cited the PLO's terrorism record and called Arafat an
``accessory.'' He invoked a U.S. law denying entry to terrorists as
superseding a U.S. agreement with the United Nations to facilitate
travel for foreigners to attend U.N. sessions.
   At the same time, though, Shultz called Palestinian participation
in any Mideast peace talks essential. He also invited Arafat to
agree to three U.S. requirements that must be met before the
administration will hold diplomatic talks.
   These are: acceptance of U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, adopted by
the Security Council in 1967 and 1973; recognition of Israel's right
to exist; and renunciation of terrorism.
   The two resolutions implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist
within secure boundaries. The Palestine National Council, the
legislative arm of the PLO, last month approved holding Mideast
negotiations within the framework of the resolutions but did not
accept the resolutions directly.
   In another move, the council edged away from advocating
terrorism, but L. Paul Bremer, who directs the State Department's
office of counterterrorism, said it did not amount to renouncing
terrorism. Bremer referred to a reaffirmation of Palestinians' right
``to resist the Israeli occupation of their land in any way
possible.''
   And the PLO group did not directly recognize Israel.
   ``We've put forward some very clear-cut requirements, which are
necessary to satisfy to enter into a substantive dialogue with the
PLO,'' Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said. ``We
look forward to the day when they'll do that, step up to bat.''
   The U.S. official called the three requirements ``a set of
criteria'' and said ``when those criteria are satisfied ... when
those conditions are met, we are prepared to engage in a substantive
dialogue.''
   Still, Redman left unclear whether the United States would
immediately deal with the PLO if Arafat met the three U.S.
conditions in Geneva.
   ``I don't want to predict what will happen,'' he said. ``We have
to make a judgment when and if those three things are addressed.
That judgment I can't make in the abstract.''
   U.S. policy on the Mideast has not changed, Redman said.
   The main aim is direct negotiations between Israel and the Arabs,
including Palestinians, on an overall peace settlement. Holding an
international peace conference as a backdrop for such talks would be
considered, the U.S. official said.
   Redman said Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, would represent the United States in the Geneva debate.

<HEAD>Witness Now Says He Lied About Child-Poisoning Confession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The last surviving witness to the alleged
jailhouse confession of a farmworker in the poisoning of his seven
children more than 20 years ago has recanted his testimony, a
newspaper reported Monday.
   James Richardson was convicted for one of the 1967 killings and
sentenced to life, accused of putting the deadly insecticide
parathion in a lunch a baby sitter served his children, age 2 to 8.
   Now, a cellmate who testified to a jailhouse confession says it
never happened, The Miami Herald reported Monday.
   ``I didn't hear Richardson say anything while I was in there,''
James Weaver, 67, told the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, a
statement he later repeated to The Herald, the newspaper said.
   ``I ain't never heard the boy say anything about it. I hope
Richardson will get out. I want him to get out.''
   Weaver did not explain to state investigators or the newspaper
why he may have lied at the trial, saying he could not recall the
details of his testimony.
   The admission may lend additional impetus to a movement to spring
Richardson from prison.
   The department of law enforcement, already investigating the case
at the request of Gov. Bob Martinez, is expected to submit its final
report to the governor this week.
   ``We are examining it now, and have been for the past number of
weeks and the governor is actively considering reviewing it on a
more formal basis,'' Brian Ballard, Martinez's director of
operations, said Monday.
   He noted that the governor can call for a clemency hearing. ``He
hasn't made that decision yet. He will be briefed on it probably
this week.''
   Richardson's lawyers had said earlier they plan to file a
petition for a new trial Thursday.
   ``I think this Weaver thing is going to put the icing on the
cake,'' John Spencer Robinson of Arcadia, who defended Richardson at
trial and initially appealed the case, said Monday.
   Some of the most damaging testimony against Richardson at his
1968 trial came from Weaver and another felon, James Dean Cuningham,
both of whom alleged that the 32-year-old fruit picker had
remorsefully and repeatedly confessed in his cell while awaiting
trial.
   A third convict died before trial, but his similar account was
read into the record. Cunningham was shot to death in 1979. No one
has been arrested in that case.
   Weaver's recantation is the latest in a series of developments to
cast doubt on Richardson's conviction, his lawyers say.
   The first came earlier this year when it was reported that the
former baby sitter, Betsy Reese, now 67, told nurses in a nursing
home in 1985 that she had poisoned the children.
   And last week, Arcadia's former chief of police, Richard Barnard,
swore he believes Richardson was ``framed'' by then-DeSoto County
Sheriff Frank Cline.
   Barnard said that Weaver and Cunningham were ``handpicked''
informants testifying in return for lenient sentences.
   They ``would have done or said anything that Frank Cline asked
them to do, including making false statements under oath.''
   Cline denied Barnard's allegation. And prosecutors say the baby
sitter, who is immobile and has lapsed into utter silence, became
confused over the years because she had innocently served a poisoned
meal.
   Richardson's new attorneys, Ellis Rubin of Miami and Mark Lane of
Washington, said they will file an appeal to the state Supreme Court
and to the trial court, charging that the state knowingly used
perjured testimony.
   ``I want a jury to hear that he was framed, and to bring out the
perjury on the record,'' Rubin told The Herald.
   Richardson, now 52, is at the Tomoka Correctional Institution in
Daytona Beach, where he will be eligible for parole in 1993.

<TEXT>
   A group of congressmen asked Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos on Monday to approve $70,000 to disseminate
a Holocaust education program for which the Reagan administration
previously blocked funding.
   The letter, written by Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., and signed by 65
colleagues, said the course, ``Facing Ourselves and History,'' has
been taught by 1,000 teachers, has rated at or near the top of its
application category and received strong recommendations for
approval from Education Department staff aides.
   Despite these factors, the letter said, money for the program was
denied in 1986, 1987 and 1988, at least partially on the basis of
biased peer reviews. One concluded that ``the Nazi point of view,
however unpopular, is still a point of view and is not presented,
nor is that of the Ku Klux Klan.''
   The official who denied the funding, Shirley Curry, was removed
from her job two days before Weiss' Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources held a hearing on the matter in
October.
   The bipartisan group of House members said all evidence indicates
``Facing History'' is an excellent program and should be distributed
to all schools that want to use it. They asked Cavazos to review the
department's past actions and use his discretionary authority to
release money for it.

<HEAD>Hirohito's Condition Unstable, Bleeding Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors reported Emperor Hirohito's condition was
unstable Monday as he continued to bleed internally and his blood
pressure fluctuated, palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old monarch received a transfusion of nearly a pint,
which helped raise his systolic blood pressure to 104, up from 71 in
the morning, Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda said.
The average reading is about 120.
   ``His condition cannot be described as stable,''Maeda quoted
doctors as saying.
   Hirohito, who has been bedridden since he started to bleed from
his intestine Sept. 19, lost considerable amounts of blood last
week. Doctors have said an intestinal blockage has forced some of
the blood into the abdomen.
   A palace official said on condition of anonymity that doctors
were draining the blood from Hirohito's abdomen ``because there is
the fear that his breathing could be affected by the (buildup of
blood).''
   ``The functioning of each internal organ has more or less
declined in the wake of the bleeding'' last week, Maeda told
reporters.
   The emperor slept most of the day Monday, but he at times has
shown signs of consciousness, Maeda said. Media reports said
Hirohito was in a semi-coma.
   ``His overall condition is gradually weakening, but there has
been no sudden change,'' said the palace official.
   The emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of the
unity of Japan.

<TEXT>
   The United States is denying refugee status to large
numbers of Soviet Jews at the main American processing point for
Soviet emigres, Jewish officials say.
   The Rome center has refused 201 refugees in the past three
months, said Ernest Berger, European director for the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society.
   U.S. immigration officials blame a sharp jump in the number of
Soviet Jews permitted to leave their country _ more than the Soviet
refugee slots set by the United States.
   Their rejections have stunned Soviet Jews who are being
temporarily housed in the seaside town of Ladispoli near Rome.
   ``It's awful. We are all in shock,'' said Eugene Shpaeyr, 31, a
biologist who came from Riga this fall with his wife and two
children.
   The overwhelming number of Soviet Jews still are granted U.S.
refugee status, U.S. and Jewish officials say. And those rejected
may appeal or apply for public interest parole. The latter program
differs from the refugee program in that emigrants must pay their
own transport to the United States, cannot claim welfare and must be
sponsored by a relative or friend.
   Most Soviet Jews do not want the parole, since it does not allow
them to become U.S. citizens or permanent residents, said Berger.
   The Jews also can move to Israel, he said in a telephone
interview from Geneva.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
in Washington said Soviet Jews used to get refugee status almost
automatically.
   ``Now there are more people than funded positions,'' he said on
condition of anonymity. ``You're going to take those who ... present
the best cases of persecution. You're going to take those in a more
precarious position.''
   Serge Liberman, 29, an engineer from Leningrad who came to Italy
in September with his mother, argues Jews still are attacked.
   ``We were afraid for our lives,'' he said.
   Like most rejected Jews, Liberman is appealing his case.
   ``It seems strange for all the refuseniks,'' he said. ``We don't
understand what is the difference between us and those who got
refugee status. All of us suffered persecution because we were
Jews.''
   Berger also said the rejections seemed arbitrary.
   ``That's possible,'' the immigration spokesman said. ``But
previously we were not faced with having more applicants than slots
available.''
   Berger said the number of Soviet emigrants arriving in Rome grew
from 2,700 in November to 1,500 in the first two weeks of December
alone.
   The United States has agreed to accept 24,500 refugees from
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in fiscal 1989, which began on
Oct. 1.
   Although the number is higher than last year's 18,000 slots, it
apparently will not meet demand. The 3,000 slots designated for
Soviet refugees in the first quarter of the year were filled by Oct.
31, the immigration spokesman said.

   The State Department on Monday denounced the
kidnappers of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins for a
``grotesque'' assertion that he had been tried and sentenced to
death.
   Spokeswoman Nancy Beck also dismissed their accusation that
Higgins had spied for Israel as ``nonsense.'' She said the
kidnappers would be held ``fully responsible'' for the American
officer's safety and welfare.
   The pro-Iranian group holding Higgins said in a statement in
Beirut that he would be executed. ``The spy has been turned over to
those responsible for executing this just and revolutionary
verdict,'' said the statement delivered to the Beirut newspaper
An-Nahar.
   A photocopy of a photograph purporting to show Higgins in a dark
sweater was pasted to the bottom of the 15-line statement. Captors
of foreigners in Lebanon usually provide a photograph to
authenticate their statements.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was head of a 76-man observer
group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when
he was kidnapped near the southern port city of Tyre on Feb. 17.
   Spokeswoman Beck, in behalf of the State Department, called upon
the hostage-takers ``and those with influence over them to release
immediately and unconditionally Col. Higgins and all other hostages
in accordance with universal humanitarian obligations.''
   According to State Department records, nine Americans, three
Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian are held hostage in
Lebanon.
   Ms. Beck said ``the notion that kidnappers have the right to try
their victims is grotesque. The rendering a judgment of those who
have committed a criminal act is a perversion of civilized concepts
of justice. The so-called trial and outcome represent a cyncial
attempt to exploit toe holding of hostages, particularly during the
Christmas seasnon.''
   The U.S. statement added: ``The charge that Col. Higgins is a spy
is nonsense.''
   It also noted that Higgins was in Lebanon as a member of the
United Nations Treaty Supervision Organization, which had just won
the Nobel Peace Prize when he was abducted.

   To succor the wretched of Armenia's earthquake, each did what he
could Monday: Alaska sent dogs to sniff out the trapped, Kenya sent
tea to warm the chilled, and a U.S. millionaire personally delivered
a $1 million check.
   Sometimes, their efforts went heartbreakingly awry.
   Before dawn Monday, a Yugoslav military plane crashed while
trying to land at Yerevan airport with medical supplies. All seven
crewmembers aboard were killed, officials said.
   It was the second crash of a relief aircraft in two days. On
Sunday, a Soviet military transport plane went down near Leninaken's
airport, killing 78 people.
   Despite Monday's new disaster, Yugoslavia was preparing to send
another plane soon to help the victims of Wednesday's quake, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   In Juneau, Ala., two dogs, their handlers and an official from
Southeast Alaska Dogs Organized for Ground Search planned to take a
flight Monday to Seattle, Wash., pick up doctors and medical
supplies there, and fly on to Armenia.
   ``The dogs that are over there are wearing out and they need
fresh dogs,'' said Gov. Steve Cowper's press secretary, David
Ramseur.
   In Washington, officials said U.S. private and public donations
to Soviet earthquake relief efforts reached $3.2 million Monday.
First Lady Nancy Reagan said she and President Reagan planned on
making their own contribution.
   The State Department said the total international relief effort
as of Monday was $26.1 million.
   Officials said Armand Hammer, chief of Occidental Petroleum and a
frequent visitor to the Soviet Union, hand-delivered a $1 million
check to Moscow.
   The international drive has mobilized an estimated 40 countries,
which have contributed help in the form of doctors, medicine, food,
blankets, tents, and heavy equipment to move debris.
   In Moscow, Council of Ministers spokesman Lev Voznesensky said 38
relief planes have arrived from abroad. He and other officials said
923 specialists from abroad with 216 search dogs were working in the
disaster area.
   In Nairobi, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya said Monday that
his country will donate tea leaves for the victims. He did not say
how much.
   ``We in Kenya can't do much to help the victims of the
earthquake,'' he said. ``But we will send them some tea to drink. It
is very cold there.''
   Sometimes, the international efforts lacked coordination.
   Two Israeli air force planes with supplies for Armenia's victims
turned around and flew back home Monday because an Israeli already
at their destination told them they were not needed there, officials
said. They were in Tel Aviv awaiting a new relief assignment
elsewhere in the region.
   The reports of the devastation continued to touch people's heart
around the world, especially those of ethnic Armenians.
   The Armenian community on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus
donated money, food and clothing Monday. Officials said about
$50,000 had been collected.
   An Armenian priest tearfully embraced an 8-year-old boy as he
dropped the equivalent of $20 from his piggy bank on the priest's
desk.
   China's Red Cross relief organization said it planned to send
relief supplies, according to the Xinhua News Agency.
   It was believed to be the first time China has offered emergency
help to the Soviet Union, a former ally with whom political
relations have been strained for nearly three decades.
   Other communist and socialist nations, including Cuba and
Nicaragua, rushed to send help, reports said.
   Turkey will send 20 helicopters to help with relief efforts, a
foreign ministry official in Ankara said Monday.
   The quake also shook Turkey's eastern province of Kars on the
Soviet border, killing four and leveling 200 homes.
   Turkey's efforts to help Armenians also come against a backdrop
of longstanding hatred between the two peoples. Many Armenians still
blame Turkey for a genocide in 1915 that is said to have killed 1.5
million Armenians.

<HEAD>DOE Plan Envisions Concentrating Nuclear Weapons Making Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A forthcoming report on renovation of the
nation's nuclear weapons plants envisions concentrating most
facilities in three ``theme parks,'' sources familiar with the
document said Monday.
   The classified report estimates that the production facilities
owned by the Energy Department need $50 billion worth of renovations
and modernization, according to administration and congressional
sources who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   The report has been sent to the White House, and accounts of some
provisions of it appeared over the weekend and on Monday in The
Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times.
   The White House had been scheduled to send it to the House and
Senate Armed Services committees later this week, but an
administration source said the schedule might slip.
   The ``theme park'' plan would organize many weapons activities
around the principal nuclear material involved, eventually
concentrating all plutonium processing at the Idaho National
Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, uranium activities at Oak
Ridge, Tenn., and tritium activities at the Savannah River Plant
near Aiken, S.C., congressional sources said.
   This would mean closure of the Rocky Flats plant near Denver,
which makes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons powered by
tritium, and the Feed Materials Production Center near Fernald,
Ohio., a uranium foundry, according to the report.
   There are other activities that could be moved into the ``theme
parks,'' and the sources said they were not sure just which might be
moved.
   Doug Elmets, press secretary for the department, declined to
comment on the report.
   Rep. David E. Skaggs, D-Colo., whose district includes the Rocky
Flats plant, said he was unaware of the plan for ``theme parks'' and
would not comment without seeing the report.
   The Rocky Flats plant is closed for cleanup inside one of its
buildings because of accidental contamination of three employees in
October.
   An administration source said the Energy Department had not
changed its estimate that $110 billion would be needed over the next
40 years to repair environmental damage at the 17 factories and
laboratories in 12 states involved in manufacturing nuclear weapons
and components.
   The report, called the ``2010 report'' for the time horizon it is
to look toward, calls for the operation of four new gas-cooled
reactors to manufacture tritium at the Idaho facility and a new
water-cooled reactor at the Savannah River plant in a design similar
to the three existing tritium reactors there.
   The Savannah River tritium reactors are closed to upgrade safety
equipment and procedures. Energy Secretary John Herrington has said
he expected them to reopen in the spring or summer, but some
published accounts have said it might be later than that.
   Tritium decays fairly rapidly _ 5.5 percent of any starting
amount turns into inert helium in a year _ and must be replenished
in the nation's nuclear weapons from time to time. Supply figures
are secret. No such replenishment is needed of uranium and plutonium
components, which frequently are recycled into new weapons when old
ones are retired.
   The department's $6.8 billion plan to replace its tritium
reactors, released last summer, called for a new Savannah River
reactor and only one Idaho reactor, though the Idaho reactor was of
a ``modular'' design that could be reproduced easily.
   Both new designs could produce either tritium or plutonium,
according to the design of the uranium fuel they are loaded with. To
produce tritium, lithium is added to fuel assemblies.
   One congressional source said the department was faced with a
choice of where to put the plutonium site, Idaho Falls or the
Hanford Nuclear Reservation near Richland, Wash., and it chose Idaho
because of growing opposition in the Richland area and the severity
of contamination there.
   The Idaho reactors would sell either electricity _ or steam to
make electricity _ to a local utility, according to the department's
summer plan. A now-mothballed Hanford reactor sold steam to the
Washington Public Power Supply System for 25 years to make
electricity.

<HEAD>Ban on Medicaid Abortions Begins in Michigan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan women with unwanted pregnancies
and little money began to search for alternatives to state-paid
abortions Monday as a voter-approved ban on Medicaid funding for the
procedure took effect.
   Health clinics offered discounts and no-interest loans to women
unable to pay the usual abortion charge of about $250, but officials
said they won't be able to cover all of the $6 million the state had
been spending on about 18,500 Medicaid abortions a year.
   ``We'll be turning away some people, and we think that's really
unfortunate,'' said Margy Long, public affairs specialist at the Ann
Arbor-based Planned Parenthood of Mid-Michigan.
   Proponents of the law said that those who believe abortion is
murder shouldn't be forced to subsidize abortions through their tax
payments, and expressed hope that it would forestall some abortions.
   The Planned Parenthood affiliate is one of several offering
financial aid to women seeking abortions. Long said Planned
Parenthood will charge low-income women $195, the same amount
Medicaid paid and about $70 less than what women with insurance are
charged.
   No-interest loans will be available for those who can't come up
with that much, she said.
   The Reproductive Health Care Center-Planned Parenthood of
Kalamazoo has raised nearly $50,000 for its emergency loan program,
said Louise Safron, executive director.
   ``We figure it needs to be $100,000 or more,'' she said.
   But Safron said even at that level, not all women will be able to
obtain abortions.
   ``I can only go back to my experience in Ohio when it de-funded
women covered by Medicaid. About 90 percent sought and received
abortions and 10 percent gave up trying to find the money and
continued their pregnancies. We'll have to wait and see what happens
in this state,'' she said.
   The end to Medicaid abortions came 10 days after the Board of
State Canvassers officially certified the Nov. 8 vote by which
Michigan citizens decided, 57 percent to 43 percent, to stop the
state funding.
   More than 450,000 Medicaid recipients were notified by mail that
abortions would no longer be paid for beginning Monday, said Bob
Harris, spokesman for the Department of Social Services.
   Carmen Franco, administrator of the 15 Womancare clinics in
Michigan which perform a large share of the state's abortions, said
not all women may have realized the cutoff was taking effect.
   Some of those who did rushed to have the procedure done last
week, resulting in a patient load on Saturday nearly double the
usual, she said.
   ``It's quiet today because of all the rush through last week.
We'll see by the end of the week how many people really heard what
was going on,'' she said.
   By midday Monday, no one had sought to take advantage of the
clinics' cut-rate of $50 for Medicaid women, she said. Women with
private insurance or who pay cash are charged $225.
   Franco said the $50 fee probably will still be too much for some
women.
   ``It's those you worry about. They may get desperate and try
something foolish and then you have a hospital case. In the worst
case, they die,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa said Monday his outlawed union
Solidarity is ready to compromise for talks with Polish authorities
and will strike only as a last resort.
   ``We are ready for agreement and compromise ... but we should be
considered as free and independent,'' he told a news conference
before ending a four-day visit to France. ``We are even ready to
talk to the devil and consider that hell exists on condition that he
recognize there is a heaven.''
   About 200 cheering supporters at the Warsaw airport chanted
``Bravo, Lech!'' to welcome the founder of Solidarity back from the
first trip abroad Polish authorities have let him take since 1981.
   An impromptu reception committee made up of prominent Solidarity
activists, fellow passengers and Solidarity members sang ``Sto Lat''
for Walesa as he emerged from customs. The song is Poland's
equivalent of ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow,'' and says, ``May he
live one hundred years.''
   Supporters thrust flowers into Walesa's hands and police cleared
a path through the crowd of photographers.
   Walesa said in Paris that permission to make the trip indicated a
changing government attitude toward reform.
   ``There is a process that we want to speed up and the fact that
we are here is evidence of a quickening,'' he said.
   After two waves of strikes earlier this year, the Polish
government offered negotiations to include the government, church
and opposition.
   The talks reached an impasse after the government refused to
legalize Solidarity, which was founded in 1980, crushed during
martial law in 1981 and outlawed in 1982. Solidarity is demanding
the government at least signal it will consider legalization before
the union will join talks.
   The talks were necessary, ``but on the condition we are
considered free and independent,'' said Walesa, who won the 1983
Nobel Peace Prize for creating the first independent trade
federation in a communist state.
   He said the union should continue struggling to improve the lives
of its members, but must do so without destroying the country.
   ``Poland doesn't need any more strikes right now. Strikes are a
last resort, an ultimate weapon which can ricochet and hurt
society,'' Walesa said.
   He said he had high hopes for Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's attempts to reform the Soviet system.
   The change in Soviet society ``is a process that does not bring
immediate results. It takes time to change the way people think,''
Walesa said, adding he did not wish to jeopardize Gorbachev's
reforms.
   Surrounded by representatives from most of France's trade unions
and Polish emigres sporting Solidarity pins, the Polish trade
unionist was ebullient, thanking President Francois Mitterrand for
inviting him to attend ceremonies Saturday marking the 40th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
   On Nov. 30, Walesa debated the chief of Poland's communist-backed
official union in a live TV broadcast that was the first time since
1983 that he has appeared on Polish television.
   ``Poland needs peace and pluralism. There is a place for both
(Prime Minister Mieczyslaw) Rakowski and Solidarity,'' he said
Monday.

   Their career paths and political philosophy
are similar, but people who know both men say Daniel R. Coats will
bring a different background and style to the U.S. Senate than the
man he replaces _ Vice President-elect Dan Quayle.
   In contrast to Quayle, an exuberant campaigner, Coats is ``very
low-key,'' said former Secretary of State Edwin J. Simcox.
   Jill L. Long, a Democrat who has run against both Quayle and
Coats, said Coats is not a passionate speaker, but contended he is
stronger than Quayle in other ways.
   ``His style was more substantive than Dan Quayle's,'' said Long,
who lost to Quayle in the 1986 Senate race and to Coats in the
November election for the U.S. House. ``He is more of an
intellectual than is Dan Quayle.''
   The son of a Michigan pharmacy owner, Coats, 45, was named Monday
by Gov. Robert D. Orr to succeed Quayle. This marks the second time
Coats, a former congressional aide to Quayle, has followed his
ex-boss to a Congress. In 1980, Coats won the 4th District House
seat Quayle vacated to run for the Senate.
   Orvas Beers, the Allen County GOP chairman, said, ``I usually
distinguish them by calling them Danny and Dan. Nobody ever called
him Danny Coats.''
   Beers called Coats ``a kind of all-American boy,'' a successful
athlete and accomplished student who became a good family man and
solid congressman. Coats, he said, ``is a conservative, but he's not
a nut about things. He's pragmatic.''
   Coats was born in Jackson, Mich., and graduated from Wheaton
College in Illinois, a conservative religious school where he was
the captain of the NCAA small-college championship soccer team,
associates said.
   Four years older than Quayle, Coats served in the Army for two
years in Virginia before getting his law degree by attending night
classes at Indiana University in Indianapolis, where he was
associate editor of the law review and graduated with honors.
   Quayle attended the same law school while serving in the National
Guard during the Vietnam War. But he admitted talking his way into
law school because his college grades at DePauw University were not
good enough for regular admission.
   Coats joined Quayle's staff in 1976 after working as an assistant
vice president and legal counsel for Mutual Security Life Insurance
Co. in Fort Wayne.
   Married for 23 years, Coats and his wife, Marcia, have three
children _ Laura, 21, Lisa, 17, and Andrew, 11.
   ``He's about as high class as you can get in every way,'' said
Beers. ``He not only will be an excellent senator, but he'll be a
good candidate in two years.''
   Coats will have to run in a special election in 1990 to win the
right to serve the final two years of Quayle's term.
   Coats has never received less than 61 percent of the vote in the
northeastern Indiana district. He defeated Long in November with 62
percent of the vote.
   ``There's not a lot of passion that comes through in his
speech,'' Long said. ``He's very reserved, but he has a nice smile
and that helps him.''
   Robert E. Gates, the 4th District Republican chairman, said Coats
is especially attentive to his district's wishes.
   ``He's not ultraconservative. He really studies what the people
want and votes that way. He takes a lot of surveys,'' said Gates.
``He really cares for his people.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday refused to stop random
drug testing of uniformed Secret Service agents but did not rule on
the constitutionality of the program.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Flannery denied a motion by a public
employees' union for a preliminary injunction, noting that other
courts have refused to halt ongoing drug-testing programs while the
question of their legality is still pending.
   Flannery did not rule on the merits of the challenge, saying he
would issue an opinion within a week. But the judge indicated during
a hearing that he might treat testing of police officers differently
than regular civilian federal employees.
   The random drug testing was challenged by 1,013 uniformed Secret
Service officers who guard the White House and foreign embassies in
the nation's capital. The Uniformed Division Officers Association
contends that the urine testing is an unconstitutional invasion of
privacy.
   Just last week, Flannery barred the Agriculture Department from
randomly testing 750 plant pest and animal disease inspectors,
saying there was no justification for invading their privacy.
Flannery noted the inspectors did not carry weapons and were not
considered law enforcement officials.
   In that decision, however, Flannery upheld testing of individual
employees suspected of being impaired by drug use while on the job.
   At Monday's hearing, Flannery said the officers were part of a
paramilitary force and had a reduced expectation of privacy stemming
from their enlistment in the Secret Service.
   ``They know what kind of work they are getting into,'' Flannery
said. ``They go into this job with their eyes open.''
   Flannery's decision was hailed by Assistant Attorney General John
Bolton as ``recognition of the importance of ongoing drug testing in
law enforcement.''

   Kidnappers holding Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins said Monday they have decided to ``execute'' the U.S. Marine
as a spy for Israel.
   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this
American spy,'' said a typewritten Arabic statement signed by the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth and delivered to the
independent Beirut newspaper An-Nahar.
   A photocopy of a picture purporting to show Higgins, the most
recent kidnap victim of nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon, was
plastered at the bottom of the 15-line statement. Hostage holders in
Lebanon usually insert a picture with a statement to prove its
authenticity.
   In its statement, the group said the decision to kill Higgins was
a retaliation for Israeli attacks against ``our people in occupied
Palestine'' _ the West Bank and Gaza Strip _ and predominantly
Shiite south Lebanon.
   It also said Higgins would die in ``revenge for the blood of the
martyrs of the latest Israeli raid'' on a Palestinian guerrilla base
nine miles south of Beirut. Nine guerrillas were killed Friday in
the Israeli attack. An Israeli officer also died.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said
he had no details of the threat beyond press reports.
   ``These hostages are all innocent victims,'' Redman said. ``They
should all be released immediately. Col. Higgins was there on a
mission of peace as a member of an international peacekeeping
operation. He, like the others, is an innocent victim.''
   Nancy Beck, a department spokeswoman, said later: ``The notion
that kidnappers have the right to try their victims is grotesque.
... The so-called trial and outcome represent a cyncial attempt to
exploit the holding of hostages, particularly during the Christmas
season.''
   Her statement added: ``The charge that Col. Higgins is a spy is
nonsense.''
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was head of a 76-man observer
group attached to the U.N. peacekeeping force in south Lebanon when
he was kidnapped near Tyre on Feb. 17.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, believed made up of
Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran, previously charged that Higgins used
his U.N. uniform as a cover for espionage. United Nations and U.S.
officials denied the charge.
   The new picture resembled a photograph released by the kidnappers
April 21. That photo showed the balding Higgins stoop-shouldered
with his eyes cast down. He had gray stubble on his cheeks and was
wearing a dark field jacket.
   The statement accompanying the earlier picture said the group had
put Higgins on trial before ``a tribunal of the oppressed'' on
spying charges.
   In Monday's statement, the group said, ``It has been proven by
clearcut evidence that (Higgins) and his American team of observers
are guilty of providing the Zionist enemy with accurate and detailed
military and security information about our resistance fighters,
their positions, movements, supply routes and the quantity and
quality of their weaponry.''
   ``The spy has been turned over to those responsible for executing
this just and revolutionary verdict,'' the statement said. No
specific execution date was mentioned.
   There have been three other communications from the group since
Higgins' abduction _ two statements listing demands for his release
and a videotape in which Higgins repeated the demands.
   The demands focused on the release of Palestinian and Lebanese
prisoners held by Israel and its proxy militia, the South Lebanon
Army. Israel rejected the demands.
   Fifteen foreigners are missing and presumed kidnapped in Lebanon.
They are nine Americans, three Britons, one Irishman, one Italian
and a Swiss. The longest held is American Terry Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Higgins' sister, Mary Fisher of Louisville, Ky., said she heard
of the kidnappers' statement only from news reports.
   Higgins, a decorated Vietnam veteran, is married to Marine Maj.
Robin Higgins and has a 17-year-old daughter.
   He graduated from high school in Louisville and from Miami
University of Ohio on ROTC scholarship in 1967. He earned master's
degrees in human resources management at Pepperdine Univiversity in
California and in political science at Auburn in Alabama.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders insisted Monday that
President Roh Tae-woo Roh take firm action against his predecessor,
Chun Doo-hwan, and ignored government attempts to calm public anger
over Chun's repressive rule. Radical students and dissidents
protested in Seoul and other cities against Chun, who last month
made a televised apology for misdeeds during eight years of military
rule that ended last February.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan, Down with Roh Tae-woo!'' about 40
protesters shouted when police blocked their march near a Buddhist
temple in which Chun lives.
   Monday marked the anniversary of Chun's seizure of power Dec. 12,
1979. Roh, then a general, sent troops into Seoul to support Chun.
   In Seoul on Monday, hundreds of radical students armed with
firebombs battled riot police at two universities, the news agency
Yonhap said. It reported peaceful street protests in Taegu, Kwangju
and Kongju.
   Police arrested 20 protesters in the central city of Taejon,
where scores of dissidents shattered windows at the prosecutor's
office.
   Roh, who won the presidential election a year ago, has opposed
punishing Chun. The president asked the nation to forgive his
predecessor but the opposition demanded Chun be forced to testify
before National Assembly committees investigating the actions of his
government.
   Chun has denied personal wrongdoing but some associates and
relatives have been convicted of corruption.
   Opposition parties led by Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung have
urged Roh to arrest aides to Chun who are linked to alleged human
rights abuses.
   Kim Young-sam said the government's lukewarm attitude toward
removing legacies of the Chun era was forcing him to make a decision
on ``the fate of the Roh regime'' and its commitment to democracy.
   Roh has promised to end ties with the old government as part of
promised reforms.

   Anti-government militants Monday
ordered newspapers not to print anything about next week's
presidential election, said a spokesman for the four major
publishing companies.
   Leaflets written in Sinhalese were delivered the People's
Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group that urged a boycott
of the Dec. 19 balloting, said the spokesman, who insisted on
anonymity. The front opposes peace overtures to minority Tamils and
demands the resignation of President Junius R. Jayewardene.
   The state-owned Lake House Group and the three independent
companies _ the Independent Newspapers, the Upali Group and Express
Newspapers _ will defy the orders, the spokesman said. They publish
12 dailies in English, Sinhalese and Tamil, and 11 weekend
newspapers, with a total circulation of 275,000.
   Anyone who violates the orders will be treated as a and ``dealt
with appropriately,'' the leaflets said.
   They were signed by by Kirthibahu Wijesinghe, widely believed to
be the commander of the Patriotic People's Movement, the military
arm of the Marxist front. The group has vowed to kill anyone who
supports the government's peace efforts.
   On Sunday night, assailants suspected of being Sinhalese
militants fatally shot or stabbed eight Sinhalese to death in
Thaniyana village, about 60 miles south of Colombo, said military
officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   Victims included the two teen-age daughters of former village
leader Maliyawadu Somatunga, a member of the governing United
National Party, officials said. His wife was critically injured,
they said.
   Officials said 18 other Sinhalese were killed since Sunday in
separate incidents in the south, the Sinhalese heartland.
   The front opposes government efforts to end the 5-year-old
insurgency by Tamil rebels who demanding a separate homeland in the
northern and eastern provinces. Nearly 10,000 people have been
killewd since fighting began in 1983.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and
Sinhalese are 75 percen, with control of the government and military.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity condemned anti-government
violence and the government defended the past use of martial law
Monday, the eve of the seventh anniversary of a crackdown on the
independent labor movement.
   Also Monday, about 200 steel workers at the Nowa Huta steel mill
near Krakow went on strike, said Solidarity activist Stanislaw
Handzlik.
   He said by telephone from the area that the workers are demanding
a 50 percent pay increase. The plant has been a center of strikes
directed by the banned Solidarity movement.
   Solidarity, which the government repressed when it imposed
martial law seven years ago and banned in 1982, denounced the
stoning of a Gdansk police station by about 300 young people.
   ``In connection with this incident, we want to recall the
fundamental principle of Solidarity, which is struggle without
violence,'' union spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz said in a statement
from Warsaw.
   A group of people, mostly teen-agers, marched to a police station
Sunday threw stones at it, breaking most of its windows. Riot police
chased away the attackers without reported arrests.
   The Solidarity statement did not say how closely the marchers
were connected with the group. But a Solidarity spokeswoman in
Gdansk, Joanna Wojciechowicz, said older activists had tried to
dissuade the younger marchers without success.
   The Solidarity official in Warsaw said riot police often use
``shockingly brutal means'' against demonstrators and that many
young people have grown up in the violate climate.
   But he added: ``Polish society as a whole does not give in to
such a climate, and that is what determines our strength. Solidarity
cannot answer violence with violence.''
   Solidarity's leader, Lech Walesa, won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1983. He returned to Warsaw on Monday after a visit to France, his
first trip outside the country since 1981.
   A government communique defended Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski's decision to impose martial law seven years ago, saying
it ``helped to prevent national catastrophe.''
   The statement was carried Monday by the official PAP news agency.
   On Dec. 13, 1981, suppressed Solidarity and detained thousands of
its faithful, including Walesa. Nine coal miners were killed by
security forces during the crackdown, called the ``state of war'' in
Polish.
   ``Dictated by a supreme necessity, the events ... did not stop
the process of democratization and broad reforms,'' the statement
said.
   ``Under conditions of order, not anarchy, businesslike
discussion, not sterile disputes, the sense of socialist renewal was
restored.''
   Government officials have argued that Solidarity in the early 80s
spearheaded activities that threatened the authority of the
Communist Party and might have prompted a Soviet invasion.

<HEAD>Governor OKs Plan for Overhaul of Chicago Public Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. James R. Thompson signed into law Monday a
bill calling for a sweeping overhaul of Chicago's school system,
which former federal Education Secretary William Bennett once
labeled the ``worst in the nation.''
   Thompson signed the bill after a symbolic walk from a
105-year-old school that is closing to the gymnasium of a new $4.6
million school on Chicago's West Side. The legislation, he said, was
``an important first step.''
   ``Parents and other community members have been given
unprecedented opportunities with this bill to control their local
school systems,'' the governor said in a statement.
   The much-debated measure, which takes effect in July, calls for a
shift of authority from the school system's central bureaucracy to
parents and principals in each of its 592 schools.
   It removes incumbent members of the Chicago Board of Education
and calls for the mayor to appoint a new board whose nominees are
suggested by a grass-roots screening committee.
   The legislation also establishes local councils made up of
parents, teachers and community residents. The councils _ one for
each school _ will have power to hire and fire principals, draft
plans for improvements and exercise some control over spending.
   School principals will lose tenure and work under four-year
contracts to be renewed on the basis of performance. They also will
have increased authority to fill teaching vacancies.
   ``While no law can ensure that our students will do better in the
classroom, this legislation will provide a more direct and
meaningful system that will be accountable for the education of our
children,'' Thompson said.
   The old school where the march to the signing ceremoney began
Monday was built in 1883. It is to be razed to make more room for a
high-tech research development.
   Thompson and Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer led a procession of
students carrying blue and gold balloons from the old school to the
new. They joined school board officials in cutting a ribbon at the
new school. Before the students entered the building, they let their
balloons float skyward.
   The reform movement that provided impetus to pass the bill grew
in part out of a bitter teacher strike in the fall of 1987 _ the
year then-Secretary Bennett called Chicago schools ``the worst in
the nation.''
   His comments helped fan a heated citywide discussion of schools
and spur legislators to action.
   A bill similar to the one signed into law Monday was passed by
the General Assembly last summer, but that measure was caught in
political bickering between Thompson and Democratic lawmakers from
Chicago over control of an oversight board.
   The dispute was settled with passage of a new bill that gives
oversight powers to the existing Chicago School Finance Authority,
created nearly a decade ago after an earlier financial crisis.

<TEXT>
   An infuriated crowd, shoving and jostling and
demanding justice, followed Mexico City's mayor on his inspection on
Monday of a charred marketplace where 62 people died in an inferno
caused by illegal fireworks.
   From a balcony, residents flung soggy pieces of burnt paper and
wood at Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis, who took office Dec. 1. One
person waved a sign that asked, ``To whom do we owe this tragedy?''
   Hundreds of people milled around Camacho Solis as he and his
aides tramped over muddy ashes and past burned candy stores, melted
rolls of plastic, soaked cigarette packages, mounds of scorched
peanuts and twisted steel beams.
   ``We share the pain of the families who lost relatives in this
tragedy,'' the mayor said during his visit to Merced market in the
heart of Mexico City.
   The shouting crowd led him to untended stalls where crates of
unexploded fireworks were still stored after Sunday's disaster.
Camacho Solis promised to have them removed.
   ``You have to give us justice. Six-year (presidential) terms come
and go but nothing changes. We don't want you to forget us,'' vendor
Liborio Garcia Chocihua said. Camacho Solis and his aides are
presidential appointees.
   Local district attorney Alfonso Nieto on Monday set the toll at
62 dead and 83 injured. None of those hurt were reported in serious
condition.
   The cause of the accident is under investigation, but officials
and residents blame illegal fireworks. Fireworks traditionally are
used from Dec. 12, the Day of the Virgin of Guadalupe, until New
Year's Day.
   Camacho Solis announced a ban on the sale and use of fireworks in
the Valley of Mexico _ something that is already forbidden without
special permit. His aides said none of the vendors in the market
appeared to have permits.
   Francisco Tirado and other vendors said illegal fireworks caused
lesser explosions and fires in the past, but the government did
nothing to prevent their sale.
   ``Usually there are only a few injured, or one or two killed,''
Tirado said.
   Thousands of Merced marketplace vendors work out of stalls on the
street, selling everything from radios to fruit _ and, in December,
fireworks.
   The market was clogged with shoppers when the blasts started.
Explosions ripped through stalls. Screaming people fled the scene.
Dozens died in nearby buildings, trapped when the buildings caught
fire.
   ``In a matter of seconds everything was gone,'' said candy seller
Fernando Cruz.
   Bulldozers ground through yard-deep muck on Monday, clearing away
the wreckage. Nieto said firefighters carted away tons of
unexploded, unsold fireworks during the night.
   A child's pail lay on its side, near a pair of women's shoes
abandoned in the panic. One vendor's table was topped by a pyramid
of blackened, melted fruit. Strands of festive red and silver
Christmas bunting still draped remains of another stall.
   Thousands of pilgrims gathered Monday at the shrine of the Virgin
of Guadalupe in northern Mexico City. Juan Ortega Durante cried as
he crawled into the basilica carrying a picture of the Virgin, then
fainted when he got inside. Family members said his nephew died in
the inferno.
   Municipal leader Everado Gamiz Fernandez said 14 tons of
fireworks were seized in his district last year, where there are
about 2,000 vendors. But he noted, ``There aren't enough resources
to inspect and watch here every day and night.''

   Pope John Paul II gave his blessing Monday to
a group of traditionalist priests and seminarians who broke with
rebel Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre to remain loyal to the papacy,
Vatican officials said.
   The pope greeted the 40 members of the Fraternity of St. Peter,
offering his blessing to each one and posing for photographs with
them, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.
   The group was accompanied by Cardinal Augustin Mayer, who heads a
Vatican commission that seeks to convince Lefebvre's followers to
stay with the mainstream Roman Catholic Church.
   Lefebvre, a Frenchman, heads an ultra-traditionalist movement
that rejects many of the modernizing reforms of the Second Vatican
Council (1962-65).
   He was excommunicated after he consecrated four bishops without
papal approval in Switzerland in June, causing the first schism in
the church in more than a century. The Vatican has warned Lefebvre's
followers that they also face excommunication if they adhere to the
schism.
   But the pope has promised to meet their traditionalist needs,
including wider use of the 16th century Latin Mass, if they remain
loyal to Rome.

   A Canadian businessman offered $36.25
million Monday for the PTL television ministry, but a bankruptcy
official said the bid probably will be rejected by a judge.
   PTL's court-appointed trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton, said ``I
would have to conclude'' that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds
would not approve the offer when it is reported to him at a hearing
Tuesday in Columbia.
   Benton predicted Reynolds would order the ministry's assets
liquidated. But he said it's possible the judge would open bidding
again at Tuesday's hearing. Reynolds has declined to comment on the
proceedings.
   The judge had wanted the bidding to start at $50 million. Benton
and the bidders declined to say why the bids were far short, and far
below offers made earlier. But the prospective buyers said more bids
were expected Tuesday.
   ``This is more or less a card game where each side is testing the
other side, and I think they (the bidders) are looking forward to
meeting in court with a proposal all of their own,'' Benton said.
   Reynolds has said if no appropriate bid was made, he would order
a liquidation of the ministry. If a bidder meets his guidelines
during the auction run by Benton, the judge said he planned to
approve a sale Tuesday.
   The ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June 1987,
three months after founder Jim Bakker left amid revelations of
luxurious living and hush money paid to Jessica Hahn, a church
secretary with whom Bakker had a sexual liaison.
   Monday's high bid was put in by Stephen Mernick, a Toronto
real-estate developer and orthodox Jew. The opening bid was $20
million by Cy Bahakel, a former North Carolina state senator who now
owns 15 television stations.
   The offers were far below the appraised value of PTL's assets _
between $92 million and $110 million, and half of that offered in
the initial auction in November.
   The auction, which was closed to the public, began about 2 p.m.
and ended about 3:45 p.m.
   The four apparent contenders for the assets _ Mernick, Bahakel,
Heritage Ministries president Sam Johnson and a new bidder, Michael
Karas, president of First Canadian Development Co. of Toronto _ all
said they may bid Tuesday.
   Heritage Ministries did not bid Monday. Karas said he dropped out
of the bidding shortly after it began because he said it was obvious
none of them was going to meet the terms set down by Reynolds, which
included starting bids at $50 million.
   Johnson said he held off bidding because he was unwilling to meet
a condition of the sale that called for the down payment to be
forfeited if the would-be buyer is unable to secure financing.
   Mernick had said he intended to offer less than $70 million for
the 2,200 acres of property, which includes a 500-room hotel, a
water park, a television studio and a 2,000-seat church.
   A month ago, Mernick said he would pay $115 million, $50 million
of it cash. But Reynolds rejected the bid, saying there were
inadequate assurances that Mernick would pay the remaining $65
million.
   Asked Monday why he bid only $36.25 million, he said, ``That's
the bid I made.''
   Johnson's group held a telethon on PTL's TV show last weekend to
try to bring contributions up to $5 million for a deposit on the
property.
   Johnson said the last of the money was raised shortly before noon
on Monday.
   ``This $5 million represents a statement on the part of the body
of Christ that cannot be ignored,'' he said on Monday's television
show.
   The only appraisal so far of PTL's property is based on its value
as an active ministry. That appraisal, conducted for Benton by
Arthur Little & Co. of Atlanta, says that with a ``charismatic
leader,'' the property would be worth $110 million.
   Under a ``stabilized ministry,'' with no well-known figure to
solicit donations, the estimate dropped to $92 million.
   The appraisal estimated that, sold piecemeal, PTL would bring
from $76 million to $85 million.
   Some say the lack of interest in the property puts those figures
in serious doubt, and that the scandals involving Bakker make the
PTL property even harder to sell. Bakker and his top PTL deputy,
Richard Dortch, were indicted last week on fraud charges.

   Common Cause, the citizens' lobby group, asked
the House ethics committee Monday to investigate whether Rep. Joseph
McDade, R-Pa., accepted gifts in violation of House rules.
   In his written request to the panel, Common Cause President Fred
Wertheimer did not accuse McDade of breaking the law or violating
ethics standards. But he said ``serious questions'' raised about the
Scranton lawmaker's activities warranted an inquiry.
   Wertheimer said his letter stemmed from a recent Wall Street
Journal report that the FBI was probing whether McDade illegally
accepted more than $45,000 in campaign gifts and speaking fees from
officials associated with United Chem-Con Corp., a Pennsylvania firm
that McDade was helping.
   Timothy Tomastik, McDade's press secretary, said the pending
investigation prevents the congressman from answering any of the
allegations yet. Nor did McDade have any comment on Common Cause's
letter, Tomastik said.
   House members must identify gifts of $250 or more, and are asked
``to avoid situations in which even an inference might be drawn
suggesting improper action.''

   Three trains crashed into each other near a busy
south London junction during rush hour Monday morning, hurling
bodies onto the tracks as the cars ``split open like a ripe
tomato.'' Officials said they counted 36 dead.
   More than 110 of the estimated 1,500 passengers on the trains
were hospitalized, 32 with serious injuries such as multiple
fractures, crushed abdomens and amputations, hospital and ambulance
officials said.
   The British Railways Board said a preliminary investigation cast
blame on a ``technical fault'' that arose after work on signaling
equipment.
   ``It is sheer bloody hell, that's what it is,'' said Jim
McMillan, London Fire Brigade's assistant chief officer, surveying
the scene at the Clapham Junction, one of Europe's busiest train
crossways.
   Police and Fire Brigade officials said 34 people died in the
crash and two died later at a hospital, bringing the death toll to
36.
   Some bodies were so badly dismembered that limbs were placed in
separate body bags, adding to confusion about the toll, said John
Norris, a Fire Brigade divisional officer. Police inspector Barry
Webb said some limbs were unaccounted for and therefore the toll
could rise.
   The accident occurred just before 8 a.m. when a London-bound
commuter train slammed into the rear of another passenger train that
was stopped about 400 yards south of Clapham Junction. The two
trains were packed with 1,500 people, many of whom were standing.
   Rescue efforts began, but an empty freight train on an adjacent
line then plowed into spillover wreckage and apparently hit some
passengers who had scrambled onto the tracks. ``Bodies were cut in
half, limbs were thrown around by the impact,'' said Robin Winch, a
doctor.
   Three cars hurtled into the air and onto an embankment and eight
overturned.
   A fourth train, crowded with commuters, stopped a few feet short
of the wreck, British Rail said.
   Rescue teams working under arc lights used heavy lifting
equipment and hydraulic jacks through the early morning hours
Tuesday searching the mangled debris for more trapped victims.
   Many passengers, dazed or slightly injured, were able to walk
away, but London Ambulance Service spokesman Chris Webb said 114
passengers were taken to five local hospitals, 30 with serious
injuries, and others were treated on the scene.
   Dozens of passengers were trapped, some for up to five hours,
waiting for rescue workers to hack through dense underbrush
alongside the tracks and to pry open roofs of overturned carriages.
   Others walked away in search of other transport to their jobs in
London. A man clutched a crushed briefcase to his chest. Another, in
a smart business suit, carried a blood-spattered raincoat.
   Seats were snapped from their mountings and strewn alongside the
wreckage. Briefcases, newspapers and business documents littered the
track and the embankment. A child's stroller lay atop one carriage.
   Lou Gill, the fire brigade's chief divisional officer, said all
survivors were rescued by 1 p.m. but he feared ``there may be
further bodies underneath'' the wreckage.
   It was the worst train wreck in Britain since 1975, when 43 died
in a subway that crashed in a London tunnel. Forty-nine people were
killed in a 1967 when a train derailed in south London.
   Transport Minister Paul Channon promised a full inquiry.
Opposition Labor Party lawmakers and railroad union leaders demanded
that the inquiry examine allegations of overcrowding and cuts in
safety spending on state-owned British Rail. The trains are not part
of London's subway system.
   Rescue workers, many visibly distraught, used infrared cameras,
metal cutters and cranes to free passengers. Emergency surgery,
including amputations, were performed on the scene. Operations
continued after nightfall, bathed in floodlights.
   ``Bodies were ripped apart and the trains were tangled
together,'' said firefighter Chris Fitzgerald. ``We had to use our
heaviest cutting gear and it was like nibbling away at the wreckage
just a little at a time.''
   ``There were pieces of bodies lying all over the place. You could
hear people moaning,'' said Webb of the ambulance service.
   Passenger Chris Reeves was in the buffet car of the moving train
when the crash occurred and ``the roof split open like a ripe
tomato.''
   ``There was furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying
everywhere,'' he said. ``We tried to find people underneath the
rubble but there was so much debris, there was nothing we could do.''
   The Emmanuel High School near the scene of the crash was
transformed into a makeshift clinic for scores of walking injured.
Schoolboys scrambled down the banks to help rescue survivors.
   Queen Elizabeth II and archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie
expressed grief and condolences. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
said she was ``grief-stricken.''
   British Rail and the National Union of Railwaymen said they would
hold their own inquiries.
   Monday's accident is the third serious train crash in Britain in
the last month. On Nov. 30, 15 passengers were injured in a crash
outside Newcastle-upon-Tyne and on Nov. 12, a driver was killed and
18 passengers hurt in a derailment near St. Helens in northwest
England.
   Britain's worst crash occurred in May 1915 when 227 people were
killed and 246 injured in a collision between a troop train and
passenger train at Gretna Green, southwest Scotland.

   The Kingston House is holding lotteries these days
for beds, trying to be fair as it goes about meeting long lines at
the shelter each day. Even in New England, there's just no getting
used to the kinds of demands that record cold can put on people.
   The first blast of the 1988-89 winter season Monday brought a
record low for the date of 2 degrees, with most of the impact seen
at shelters.
   At the Kingston House, seven homeless people were in line as the
doors to the shelter opened at 6:30 a.m. Phil Gonzalez, in charge of
admitting people to the shelter, said a lottery has been held before
noon in recent days for the beds. Those who lose out are referred to
other shelters or offered a blanket and the floor.
   He said that typically, about 60 people take part in the lottery
seeking one of the 40 beds at the shelter available for transients.
The other 20 beds at the shelter are used by residents who stay for
months while they take part in a rehabilitation program.
   Throughout the city Sunday night, about 75 people were
transported to shelters, and more were expected as the cold weather
continues, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said.
   Electricity demand set a wintertime record in the region Monday
and came close to surpassing the all-time record, a spokesman said.
   ``I don't have a final number set for today yet, but we can
definitely say we surpassed the previous winter record of 19,277
megawatts,'' said Bill Sheperdson of the New England Power Pool.
Monday's average peak load was between 19,400 and 19,500 megawatts,
he said. The system record of 19,500 megawatts was set during a heat
wave in August.
   Elsewhere, life went on, albeit at a slower pace.
   Hardy fishermen at the Boston Fish Pier told of chipping ice off
the bows with wooden mallets to keep trawlers from getting nose
heavy.
   ``No grog. A lot of coffee,'' said Paul Hughes, 38, a mate aboard
the Olympia, an 86-foot fishing trawler that had just returned from
a week at sea.
   ``As long as you're moving, it isn't bad,'' said Hughes, wearing
four layers of long-sleeved shirts and a cap with ear flaps. ``The
bad part is if we do damage. Then you've got to stop and mend it up.
That's bare-handed. That's nasty.''
   Ray Southmayd, of the United Services of America window washing
service, said workers use a special non-freeze solution in bitter
weather.
   ``I'm sure (any window washer) is miserable, but it's all in the
line of work,'' Southmayd said.
   Gerry Cudyer, who runs the city's 24-hour hotline for citizen
complaints, said her office received about 100 calls since the
temperature took a dive Sunday. Most were about a lack of heat from
tenants whose landlords seemed unprepared for the cold, she said.
   ``In winter it's inevitable. But when it was 50 degrees last
week, they let the oil run out,'' she said. ``They were caught by
the dramatic swing in temperature from 50 to 0 in a matter of days.''
   The homeless problem in Boston gets special attention from a city
commission and a mayor who heads a national conference on the issue.
   At a city-sponsored summit Monday on the homeless, which was
designed to begin building a groundswell of support for more federal
participation in providing affordable housing, speakers said efforts
must focus on moving beyond temporary shelter to permanent housing.
   Flynn said the federal commitment to providing housing dropped
off sharply during the Reagan administration. The mayor also touted
Boston's pledge to provide a warm bed and hot meal for anyone on the
streets.
   Results of a street-by-street count of the homeless have not been
tallied yet, but Flynn said preliminary figures indicate it will top
the 3,300 recorded in February. The number of city shelter beds has
increased from 972 in 1983 to 2,754 this year.
   Shelter officials say they see more children than before. At the
Salvation Army, a special party was planned Tuesday for 350 children
with actress Liv Ullmann and a live performance of the
``Nutcracker'' ballet.

   Three paintings by Vincent van Gogh,
including his early masterpiece ``The Potato Eaters,'' were stolen
from a national museum on Monday night, police said.
   The art theft appeared to be the biggest in Dutch history.
   The van Goghs were taken from the Kroeller-Mueller National
Museum near the West German border by thieves who apparently gained
entry through a broken window after closing hours, said police
spokeswoman Bep Lijftogt.
   The two other paintings by the 19th-century Dutch impressionist
were ``Dried Sunflowers'' and ``Weaver's Interior,'' she reported.
   Two guards were in the sprawling, single-story museum at the
time, but they noticed nothing amiss, said police spokesman Dirk
Talsma.
   Police immediately sealed off the 25-acre park in which the
museum sits. A helicopter equipped with floodlights and police with
dogs hunted for suspects on the heavily forested grounds.
   They suspended the search at 1 a.m. Tuesday and planned to resume
at daybreak.
   No official valuation of the paintings was available from the
museum, but the director of Christie's auction gallery in Amsterdam
said that if sold on the open market _ not possible for a stolen
work _ ``The Potato Eaters'' could bring as much as van Gogh's
``Sunflowers.''
   That painting brought $39.9 million when auctioned off in London
in March 1987.
   ``The sky's the limit,'' Christie's director Harts Nijstad told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ```The Potato Eaters'
is an enormously important painting.''
   ``The Potato Eaters'' in the Kroeller-Mueller museum was the most
complete of several versions of the same subject, according to
Nijstad, who said a less important version sits in the van Gogh
National Museum in Amsterdam.
   No estimate on the value of the other two paintings was
immediately available, but Nijstad said all three were ``frightfully
important.''
   He speculated that the paintings were stolen for ransom, adding,
``Whether the ransom will be money-wise or political is something
the future will tell us.''
   The museum's silent alarm triggered a warning in the local police
station at about 8:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. EST), and police rushed to the
museum.
   Completed in 1885, ``The Potato Eaters'' is one of van Gogh's
most poignant depictions of poverty and hunger in the Netherlands.
It shows a farm family seated around a table eating potatoes by
lamplight, the hunger evident on their angular faces.
   Five van Gogh works were included in a list published two weeks
ago of the top 10 prices paid for paintings at the world's two major
auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's. Van Gogh's ``Irises'' was
sold last month for $53.9 million, the highest price paid for any
painting in the world.
   The Kroeller-Mueller has dozens of van Goghs exhibited in a
special wing. The museum and surrounding estate were bequeathed to
the nation in 1938 by art collector Mrs. H.E.L.G. Kroeller-Mueller.
   The theft was the latest in a series of recent burglaries at
Dutch museums.
   In May, thieves broke a window and stole impressionist paintings
by van Gogh, French painter Paul Cezanne and Dutch painter Johan
Jongkind from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum.
   Those paintings were initially valued at up to $50 million, but
art authorities later scaled down the estimated value.
   The paintings were later recovered in a raid on an Amsterdam
hotel spearheaded by an undercover policeman posing as a buyer of
stolen art.
   That theft, mounted through a broken ground-floor window at a
time when no guards were in the Amsterdam museum, prompted calls for
stronger security in the nation's museums.
   The Kroeller-Mueller museum never before had a major theft,
police spokesman Talsma said.
   ``The Potato Eaters'' was painted when van Gogh was living in a
village in southern Holland.
   It is considered his most ambitious work from his Dutch period,
before he moved to France in 1886 and came under the influence of
Impressionism. The painting is done in dark colors in a rough style,
which van Gogh said in a letter to his brother was meant to
illustrate the rough life that the peasants lived.
   Van Gogh's artistic career lasted only 10 years, but during that
time he produced about 850 paintings. About 50 of the paintings are
still in private hands, according to James Roundell, who supervised
the ``Sunflowers'' sale.
   A highly placed source at the Van Gogh Museum said on condition
of anonymity last month that one great fear his museum had was that
the record prices being paid for works by van Gogh would bring ideas
of theft into people's heads.
   Van Gogh sold only one painting during his lifetime.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Arctic air that flowed across Canada and into the north-central
and northeast United States caused record-low temperatures Monday,
but Billings, Mont., had a record high.
   Hugh Crowther, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's
Severe Storms Center in Kansas City, Mo., said about 25 cities
reported record low temperatures.
   Among them were Albany, N.Y., where thermometers dipped to 12
below zero; Allentown, Pa., 2 degrees; Asheville, N.C., 16 degrees;
Baltimore, 12 degrees; Boston, 2 degrees; Detroit, 2 below zero;
Elkins, W.Va., 10 below; Hartford, Conn., 3 below; Houghton Lake,
Mich., 12 below; Newark, N.J., 6 degrees; Philadelphia, 8 degrees;
and Wilmington, Del., 8 degrees. Washington, D.C., tied its record
for the date of 13 degrees.
   Saranac Lake, N.Y., near Lake Placid, had the coldest temperature
in the nation Monday morning, 28 below zero.
   But Billings reached 57 degrees to break their high temperature
record for the date, which was 56 degrees set in 1934. Oakland,
Calif., tied its high temperature mark with 65 degrees. That record
was set in 1976.
   Gale warnings were posted for Monday night on the North Carolina
coast, Lake Huron and the strait of Washington state. High wind
warnings were posted over the Montana Front Range, the Rockies and
Upper Yellowstone Valley.
   Winds gusted to 41 mph at Riverton, Wyo., and to 35 and 45 mph in
the higher elevations between Cheyenne and Rock Springs, Wyo.
   Snow fell Monday night over eastern Minnesota, eastern Iowa,
northern Illinois, Wisconsin, upper Michigan and eastern lower
Michigan. Rain was scattered over northern Florida and southern
Georgia, as well as from western Montana across the Idaho panhandle
into eastern Washington and along the northern Pacific Coast. Rain
was mixed with snow near Charleston, S.C.
   Snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 7 p.m. EST included 2
inches at Escanaba, Mich., and an inch at Duluth, Minn., and Green
Bay, Wis.
   For Tuesday, the National Weather Service forecast snow showers
extending from western New England across the lower Great Lakes,
much of Michigan and south through the Virginias. Rain will reach
from western North Dakota across Montana, the northern Plateau and
the northern Pacific Coast with rain becoming snow in the higher
elevations.
   High temperatures will be in the teens in northern Maine; in the
20s and 30s from the reminder of New England across the central
Atlantic Coast, the northern half of the Appalachians, the Great
Lakes, the Ohio Valley, the upper Mississippi Valley and eastern
North Dakota; the 40s and 50s from North Carolina across northern
Florida, the central Gulf of Mexico states, the Tennessee Valley,
the central Mississippi Valley, parts of the northern half of the
Plains, the upper Missouri Valley, the Rockies, the Plateau and the
northern half of the Pacific Coast; the 70s in southern Florida,
southern Texas southern Arizona and southern California; and in the
60s in most of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Parliament Returns for Trade Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government
announced its intention Monday to make sure Canada can start the
free trade agreement with the United States as scheduled Jan. 1.
   But his opponents said too many issues remain to be discussed for
the legislation to be rushed through Parliament, called back into
session for work on the trade bill.
   The prime minister's Progressive Conservative Party won 169 of
the 295 seats in the House of Commons in the hotly contested Nov. 21
elections, so it could force quick passage of the legislation.
   The measure will phase out all remaining tariffs between the
United States and Canada over a 10-year period.
   ``The people have spoken in a general election three weeks ago,''
Gov. Gen. Jeanne Sauve said in the formal ``throne speech''
traditionally opening a new parliamentary session in Ottawa. ``In
the election, my government sought and received a mandate for its
policies, including the free trade agreement between Canada and the
United States that is to take effect on Jan. 1, 1989.''
   The opposition Liberal Party, which won 82 seats in Commons, and
the socialist New Democratic Party with 43 seats have said they will
not stand in the way of ultimate passage but want extensive debate
on the problems they believe the trade agreement will bring.
   The bitter debate over free trade that marked the fall election
campaign would be renewed in Parliament.
   One seat, won by a Conservative who died after the election, is
vacant.
   Liberal leader John Turner, who led a self-proclaimed ``crusade''
against the trade agreement, said in an interview with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. that he was not stalling the legislation.
   ``To insist on a thorough debate - that's not stalling,'' he
said, noting that the popular vote showed more Canadians in favor of
the two parties opposing the agreement than for the Conservatives.
   New Democratic leader Ed Broadbent said he wanted amendments to
be introduced to protect workers whose jobs are lost in company
restructurings tied to the trade agreement.
   He told the CBC that Mulroney won a mandate for the trade
agreement, but ``he received no mandate to ramrod it right through
Parliament.''
   A delay of days, weeks or probably even months in completing the
enabling legislation needed would not hinder the agreement.
   The United States has completed all its legislation for the
agreement, signed by Mulroney and President Reagan last Jan. 2.
   In Canada, it passed the elected House of Commons last August but
then was bottled up in the Liberal-controlled, appointed Senate to
force the election. The legislation approved last August has expired
and the process now must be repeated in Commons.

<HEAD>Filipino Attackers Kill Police Major and His Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assailants early Tuesday shot and
killed a police major and his policeman son, who was organizing an
anti-communist group in a rebel-infested neighborhood in Cebu City,
police reported.
   Capt. Salvador Sanchez said that Maj. Jesus Negapatan, 59, and
his son, Patrolman Jesus Negapatan Jr., about 30, were standing on a
street corner in Cebu City when three men and a woman emerged from a
taxi. At least three of the four opened fire, Sanchez said.
   Sanchez said father and son were killed instantly and the
assailants escaped. He said the elder Negapatan was administrative
officer of the Cebu City police force and the son, a traffic
policeman, was organizing the anti-communist group in their
neighborhood.
   Sanchez said it was not clear if the killers were New People's
Army guerrillas or ordinary criminals.
   Cebu City is a major metropolitan area, about 350 miles southeast
of Manila.
   Faced with an upsurge in urban violence, the Philippine military
has begun organizing a new civilian anti-communist force, the
Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units, to assist in guarding
villages and urban neighborhoods against the New People's Army.
   Volunteers for the Units are to phase out vigilante groups and
the Civilian Home Defense Force, both of which have been accused of
widespread human rights abuses in the fight against the rebels.
   President Corazon Aquino said on Monday at a meeting in Cagayan
de Oro that members of the new militia will be rigidly screened,
especially those who previously served in the Civilian Home Defense
Force.
   The New People's Army has waged a 19-year insurgency to establish
a Marxist state in the Philippines.

<HEAD>Peruvian Miners Agree to Halt Crippling Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT SEAVEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and a communist-led mine
workers' federation signed an accord late Monday to end an
8-week-old strike that has cost Peru nearly $300 million, Prime
Minister Armando Villanueva said.
   Strike leader Saul Cantoral said miners will resume work
nationwide in three days, bringing an end to a paralysis in Peru's
most important industry.
   Villanueva told reporters the strike cost the nation nearly $300
million, one-fourth of last year's mineral export income of $1.2
billion last year.
   Peru is a leading world producer of silver and copper and a major
source of gold, lead and zinc. It traditionally received more than
half of its hard currency earnings from mineral exports.
   Peru's 60,000 miners struck on Oct. 17 to force mine companies to
honor a government-union pact permitting labor contracts in the
mining industry to be negotiated jointly with all mining enterprises
rather than on a company-by-company basis.
   The strike came as Peru entered a severe recession, marked by
inflation expected to surpass 1,500 percent this year and a shortage
of dollar reserves to purchase vital imports.
   Industry officials said strikers were being manipulated by
communist guerrillas seeking to undermine the nation. The miners'
federation denied it.
   Terms of the new accord signed by Cantoral and other leaders of
the National Federation of Mine and Metalworkers and by Villanueva
were not immediately announced.
   Federation director Guillermo Diaz said earlier Monday that the
federation was demanding that the government promise to enact a law
to force public and private mining firms to abide by the
government-union pact.
   Such an agreement will greatly strengthen the miners' bargaining
position during contracts, industry analysts said.
   The National Mining Society, Peru's most important association of
private mine owners, has strongly opposed joint contract
negotiations. It says the federation will use its bargaining power
to cripple the industry at will.
   Government and industry officials said more than half the
strikers began returning to work last week. The federation, which
represents dozens of mine unions, denied the report.
   Thousands of highland miners, many with families, marched on Lima
after the strike began and set up camps around the city to publicize
their plight. Miners engaged in street protests which at times ended
in violence and arrests.

   Earthquake relief efforts in Armenia are
hampered by bad organization, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said
Monday. Hope dwindled for people trapped in the rubble, and the
smell of decaying corpses filled the air.
   Other officials said rescuers working around the clock with
everything from their bare hands to fiber optic cameras have pulled
more than 18,000 people from earthquake wreckage.
   ``The work is not going badly, but we would wish it to be more
organized,'' Ryzhkov told foreign journalists at a news conference
in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia.
   He also said many people died unnecessarily in Wednesday's
earthquake because poorly built houses collapsed into ruins. ``We
believe gross violations were permitted'' in designing and building
the apartment houses that collapsed.
   ``If the homes had been of good-quality construction, something
like this would not have happened,'' Ryzhkov said.
   He said this view was shared by a government investigative
commission and by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who visited the
disaster area over the weekend.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, published a scathing
article Monday about ``scrap-builders'' who constructed shoddy
apartment buildings that crumbled into ``concrete and metal graves
over victims who were buried alive.''
   Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov estimated the temblor killed up
to 60,000 people. Ryzkhov said it was certain that 15,000 had died,
but the figure would problably rise to 45,000.
   Five days after the tragedy struck, shelter and salvage equipment
remained in short supply.
   Reporting Monday from Leninaken, near the quake's epicenter, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said, ``People wander among the
debris of what used to be their homes, straining their ears in the
hope of hearing the voice of a missing sister, father, brother or
simply any human voice.''
   Soviet television showed a worker in Kirovakan, where 60 percent
of the houses were destroyed, bending a metal reinforcing rod in a
collapsed concrete wall by hand, his face strained with the effort.
Another man moved mounds of broken concrete with a shovel.
   A man and boy huddled over a fire in a small bucket, their only
source of warmth during what the television announcer described as
five nights on a pile of rubble because there were not enough tents.
Snow and temperatures of 14-23 degrees Fahrenheit were forecast.
   Boris Shcherbina, a deputy prime minister who directed the
cleanup after the April 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant accident, told
Tass in Leninakan:
   ``We shall work without letup to save everyone still alive under
the debris, even on the 10th and the 12th day after the disaster. We
shall work for as long as there is a chance to save the life of at
least one unhappy victim.''
   He said more than 5,000 people had been rescued in Leninakan.
Tass said 18,500 had been saved in the entire disaster area, which
had a population of 700,000.
   But Ryzhkov said at the new conference that only 5,398 had been
saved throughout the region. He said 10 people were pulled alive
from the rubble on Monday.
   Associated Press correspondent Carol J. Williams visited Spitak,
a city of more than 25,000 before the quake, and said the smells of
burning and decomposing bodies were everywhere.
   A British charity called International Rescue Corps said its
14-member team in Spitak was using ultrasonic listening equipment
and fiber optic cameras to locate survivors trapped under collapsed
buildings.
   More than 200 search dogs were helping, and infrared devices that
can detect the warmth of bodies trapped under rubble.
   Many of the nearly 1,000 foreign helpers have said local
officials are not organizing the rescue well and interpreters to
help translate the many languages are scarce.
   The second crash of a relief plane in two days was reported.
   All seven crewmembers died when a Soviet-built Yugoslav military
transport loaded with medical equipment and other supplies went down
10 miles from the airport in Yerevan, capital of the Armenian
republic. Boris Panyukov, first deputy aviation minister, made the
announcement in Moscow.
   Local reporters said the An-12 cargo plane crashed before dawn
because the pilot mistook a well-lighted highway for a runway.
   On Sunday, a Soviet military plane bringing soldiers to help the
rescue effort crashed as it approached Leninakan's airport, killing
78 people.
   Aid continued pouring in from abroad. Council of Ministers
spokesman Lev Voznesensky told the Moscow news conference 38 foreign
relief planes had arrived and the most, six, were from France.
   George Reid of the Geneva-based League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent Societies said in Yerevan there was little hope of finding
more survivors.
   He said the only people still alive would be those who found
water and air where they were trapped. Reid quoted reports that only
150 people survived in Spitak; other reports say 10 percent lived.
   Meanwhile, Armenian activists said demonstrators fought with
soldiers because several nationalist leaders were arrested.
   One activist who avoided arrest, Raphael Popoyan, said by
telephone three protests took place Sunday in Yerevan because
leaders of the Karabakh Committee were arrested. The committee has
led a campaign for Armenian control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a
predominantly Armenian region of neighboring Azerbaijan.
   He said soldiers and demonstrators fought during a protest near
the railway station and several people were wounded. An editor at
Armenpress confirmed the violence but said it did not appear to have
been serious.

   Rescuers and officials trying to save
survivors of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia said Monday they
desperately need a better command system, more coordination, and
better equipment.
   In addition, no Soviet troops were visible among the rescue
workers in Leninaken, one of the hardest-hit cities in Wednesday's
earthquake.
   Instead, the rescue operations were being carried out mostly by
friends and relatives of those still trapped. They used small tools
like hammers and torches.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said enthusiam was plentiful,
but ``today the question is organization.'' He spoke at a news
conference late Monday in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   Sverre Kilde, a U.N. disaster relief officer, said the rescue
effort appeared well organized on the national and regional level,
but locally in Leninakan it was suffering from a lack of control.
   ``Here there are 50-60 people shouting in all directions,'' said
U.N. diaster relief officer Sverre Kilde, speaking of a rescue site
he visited in Leninakan on Sunday. ``It would have been much more
reasonable to have an army captain or colonel in charge of it.''
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov told reporters that more than
18,000 soldiers were in the earthquake area, but in Leninakan none
was seen helping with rescue operations.
   Asked about the situation, Yazov and Ryzhkov said the soldiers
were ensuring order in Leninakan and helping unload relief supplies
from cargo planes.
   They also said troops were involved in rescue operations in
Spitak, a city of more than 25,000 people that was almost totally
destroyed by the earthquake.
   Ryzhkov said soldiers had cut off both cities to all but relief
traffic.
   Two relief planes have crashed in heavy air traffic in the
region. A crash of a Soviet military plane on Sunday killed 78
people, and one of a Yugoslavian military aircraft left seven dead
early Monday.
   The Soviet premier gave high marks to the medical effort, saying
doctors had performed 2,500 complicated operations in the field
during the first 24 hours after the quake.
   However, area doctors said they badly need artificial kidney
machines and blood-filtering devices. They hope to receive more of
both from abroad.
   Veterans of rescue efforts for past earthquakes in Mexico City
and El Salvador say it is difficult to supply the remote Soviet area
near the Turkish border.
   Rescuers, meanwhile, pleaded for more cranes and bulldozers to
pull away slabs of concrete and other debris in an effort to free
those still trapped in the rubble.

   A Syracuse University art student pleaded
guilty Monday to stealing the skull of a 19th-century mayor from a
mausoleum.
   Kevin D. McQuain, 19, of New York City entered the plea to a
felony count of body stealing.
   In exchange for the guilty plea, Onondaga County Court Judge
Patrick J. Cunningham said he would not sentence McQuain to serve
time in jail and will get him youthful offender status, which will
clear the conviction from his permanent record.
   McQuain, a scholarship student who has been suspended from school
since his arrest Oct. 19, still must face action by university
officials.
   The freshman told police he took the skull of former Syracuse
Mayor John J. Crouse, who died in 1886, because he wanted to use it
for sculpting class. McQuain was charged after another student saw
him boiling the skull in the kitchen of his dormitory.

   A Washington-based forensics expert
arrived Monday to begin examining the bodies of six women found in
southeastern Massachusetts since July believed to be the victims of
a serial killer.
   Douglas Ubelaker of the Smithsonian Institution will seek more
details on the cause of death of all six and will attempt to
identify the three bodies that remain unidentified, according to a
spokesman for the investigation.
   High on Ubelaker's agenda will be examining a sixth body found
over the weekend by hunters in a wooded area of Dartmouth off
Interstate 195. The body is one of three which has yet to be
identified.
   ``To make a positive identification, we need to find something on
the skeleton that is absolutely unique,'' Ubelaker said in an
earlier interview.
   State police dogs and a specially trained dog from Connecticut
returned to the woods outside of New Bedford on Monday and combed a
6- to 8-square-mile area where the bodies have been found.
   Pina said Monday that he believes the sixth body was connected to
the other five and was likely the victim of the same killer or
killers.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that it's all similar,'' he said.
The sixth woman, whose skeletal remains were badly decomposed, was
believed to have been dead for the longest period _ dating back to
last spring.

   An Italian Air Force stunt pilot who replaced
a colleague who died in the disaster at a West German air show in
August was killed on Monday when his plane crashed during a training
flight, news reports said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the plane, an
Aermacchi MB339, crashed about 10 minutes after takeoff into a field
in northeastern Italy outside the city of Udine. The pilot,
identified as Lt. Col. Paolo Scoponi, 36, was flying solo, ANSA said.
   It reported that the victim was an experienced test pilot who
recently joined the ``Frecce Tricolori,'' the Air Force squad which
performs air shows.
   Three Italian stunt jets from the squad collided during an air
show at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base on Aug. 28, and one of the jet
plunged into the crowd of spectators.
   Seventy people died and several hundred were injured. A report
issued in October by the West German defense ministry blamed pilot
error for the crash.
   The squad's name means ``Tri-color Arrows'' and refers to the
red, white and green of the Italian flag.
   Founded in 1930 as a school of aerobatics, it has been a separate
unit of the Italian air force since 1956.

<TEXT>
   Gold, silver, cannons and other wreckage from a
pirate ship that has lain buried in sand off Cape Cod for 271 years
belong to the salvage entrepreneur who found them, the Massachusetts
Supreme Court ruled Monday.
   Barry Clifford will be entitled to keep the artifacts, now worth
an estimated $40 million, and will not have give the state of
Massachusetts a 25 percent share, according to Clifford's attorney,
Allan H. Tufankjian.
   In a unanimous opinion, the high court rejected the state's claim
of sovereignty over the wrecked sailing vessel Whydah lying beneath
the sand in the waters of Wellfleet on Cape Cod, where it foundered
in April 1717.
   ``It's a great Christmas present,'' Clifford said in a telephone
interview from his home in Chatham, calling the Whydah the only
pirate ship in the world ever to be found and salvaged. ``This is
it. There's really nothing else.''
   He said it was unfair of the state to claim one-quarter of the
find when all the risks associated with underwater salvage were
taken by him and his company, Maritime Underwater Surveys Inc.
   In 1982, based on research from contemporary accounts, Clifford
found ``an unidentified, wrecked and abandoned vessel'' one mile off
Wellfleet under about 14 feet of water and 5 feet of sand.
   Since 1ereignty as surely as the Whydah foundered on the shoals
off Wellfleet,'' Justice Neil Lynch wrote for the highllinois, Box

<TEXT>
   By the time Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins left for college, he was well on the way to fulfilling the
ambition he expressed in his senior yearbook: ``For my family to
always be proud of me.''
   His uncle, Delbert Eagle of Lancaster, said following Higgins'
abduction Feb. 17 in Lebanon that whatever happens, Higgins would
continue to make his family and his country proud.
   ``He loves his country,'' Eagle said at the time. ``He is capable
of standing up as well as an ordinary man will under the
circumstances. ... I don't think they could bring enough pressure or
pain to cause him to betray his country in any way.
   ``I think he would die first.''
   On Monday, Lebanese kidnappers holding Higgins, 43, said in a
statement they have sentenced him to death as a spy for Israel.
   ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this
American spy,'' said the typewritten Arabic statement signed by the
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth.
   But the statement did not set an execution date.
   Higgins' sister, Mary Fisher of Louisville, said she had no
knowledge of the death threat other than what she has heard from
news reports.
   ``I have not been contacted by anyone,'' she said.
   Higgins was a onetime aide to former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger. When he was abducted, he headed a 75-member observer
group assigned to a United Nations peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon.
   A Pentagon official said at the time of the abduction that
Higgins was on temporary detail serving as the chief of the U.N.
Truce Supervision Organization's Lebanon Observer Group.
   The group monitors cease-fire violations on the Lebanon-Israel
border. Higgins was the top-ranking American officer assigned to the
group, holding the title of senior U.S. military observer.
   When Higgins was growing up in southern Jefferson County in the
late 1950s and early 1960s, his friends never expected the chunky,
cheerful youngster to make his career in the military.
   ``He was just pretty much an average guy at Southern High
School,'' Rudy Fischer, an old friend, recalled after Higgins'
abduction.
   ``I think people were kind of surprised when he went into the
Marines,'' Fischer added. ``You think of the Marines as being macho
types, and he really wasn't like that.''
   Even so, Higgins won appointment to West Point, but chose instead
to study at Miami University of Ohio on a Navy ROTC scholarship.
   He opted for the Marines rather than the Navy after suffering
seasickness during a summer cruise to Scandinavia, his
brother-in-law, Harold Fischer, recalled.
   Others who knew Higgins in Louisville remember him as a bright,
well-rounded young man who stood out in school and on the athletic
field.
   Higgins, whose friends knew him as ``Rich'' or ``Pinky,'' earned
mostly A's and B's. He played guard on his high school football team
in 1962 and 1963.
   ``He gave us 100 percent effort,'' said Henderson Wilson, then
the team's line coach.
   Higgins was president of his sophomore class, vice president of
his senior class and won membership in the Beta Club and Key Club,
according to his senior yearbook.
   His fellow seniors and teachers voted him one of the top 10
members of the class of 1963, based on scholarship, leadership,
school spirit and personality, said Assistant Principal Ralph Allen.
   He was commissioned as a second lieutenant when he graduated from
Miami University of Ohio, and later earned master's degrees in human
resources management at Pepperdine University and political science
at Auburn University.
   Higgins was born in Danville, and lived in Lancaster, Covington
and Louisville. He and his first wife, the former Bonita Spalding of
Louisville, have a 17-year-old daughter, Christine Lynn. He has
another sister, Linda Lee Miller, of Memphis, Tenn.
   Higgins' second wife, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, works at the
Pentagon.
   Both of his parents have died _ his mother, Mary Ethel Higgins,
in 1979, and his father, William F. Higgins, shortly after his
abduction.

   Country music star Waylon Jennings was
listed in stable condition after undergoing triple bypass heart
surgery Monday, a spokeswoman said.
   The 51-year-old singer underwent 3{ hours of surgery at Baptist
Hospital, said publicist Bridget Dolan. ``He's doing just fine,''
she said. ``There was no evidence of a heart attack.''
   Jennings was hospitalized Sunday morning after having chest pains
while traveling to a concert in Bristol, Tenn., Ms. Dolan said.
   ``He was just 20 miles out of Nashville and he decided to just
turn around and come back,'' she said.
   Tests were performed Sunday and doctors found three partially
blocked arteries and decided to perform bypass surgery, she said.
   One of the arteries was the same one that became blocked before,
leading to October's angioplasty, a procedure in which a small
balloon is inserted into an artery and inflated, breaking away a
blockage.
   Jennings' wife, singer Jessie Colter, and son were with him at
the hospital, and the entertainer was in good spirits before the
procedure, Ms. Dolan said.
   Jennings, whose work on 13 million-selling albums has won him two
Grammy awards and four Country Music Association awards, is probably
best known for his duet with Willie Nelson on ``Mamas, Don't Let
Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys.''
   He also had a hit with the ``Dukes of Hazzard'' theme song. His
latest album is ``Full Circle.''

   Rescue workers said today there was
little hope of finding more survivors in the wreckage of the mammoth
Armenian earthquake, and officials estimated the death toll at more
than 50,000.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, after touring the disaster area,
accused ``provocateurs'' of exploiting the disorder produced by the
quake to create instability in the ethnically troubled republic and
said, ``They must be stopped.'' Armenian activists reported clashes
with troops Sunday over the arrest of several nationalist leaders
and said several people were wounded. They said the violence
occurred in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   Gorbachev promised residents of the disaster zone that the
government would begin an investigation of why newly constructed
apartment buildings crumbled so easily while older buildings
remained standing during Wednesday's quake.

   Nearly 10 million Americans lost their jobs due
to plant closings or layoffs from 1983 to 1988 despite the longest
peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history, the government
reports.
   Of 9.7 million displaced workers during the period, 4.7 million
were so-called ``tenured'' workers who had held their jobs for three
years or more, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says in the latest of
its biennial reports on worker displacement.
   That was a slight decline from earlier BLS studies of overlapping
five-year periods _ 1979-84 and 1981-86 _ which both had shown that
5.1 million tenured workers lost their jobs during the respective
periods. But each of those periods also included the severe
recession of 1981-82. As a result, government and private economists
say the new figures show a persisting displacement problem.

   Setting up the George Bush administration _ the

being underwritten by the taxpayers to the tune of about $3.5
million.
   Bush's paid transition staff has grown to 149 at last count, with
about the same number of volunteers, officials say.
   The highest paid are top advisers James Baker III and Fred Zeder,
both of whom are being paid at an annual rate of $71,377. After the
transition, Baker will become secretary of state. To meet the
payroll as well as pay for copying, research, telephones, rent,
supplies and the like, Bush receives a total of $3.5 million in

   Black students especially in the South are far
more likely than whites to be targets of corporal punishment or
school suspension, according to a study.
   ``Teachers often overreact to blacks, especially black males.
Interestingly, that's true even with black teachers,'' said Joan
McCarty First, executive director of the Boston-based National
Coalition of Advocates for Students, which Sunday released an
analysis of federal school data.
   The report found black youngsters are more than twice as likely
to be hit or be labeled mentally retarded as whites. And while
blacks make up 16 percent of the school population, they comprise
only 8 percent of those in gifted student programs. The findings
were based on an analysis of biennial data published by the U.S.
Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights in 1986, the latest
year available.

Christmas gifts this season, and one in four will spend at least
$500, a Media General-Associated Press poll shows.
   Given those expenses, it's not surprising that a vast majority of
Americans _ 85 percent _ say they believe Christmas is too
commercialized.
   Still, a plurality celebrate the holiday as a religious, not just
a social, occasion. The survey of 1,084 adults in the continental

   Foreigners caught in a clash between Chinese

vendors' tables and running down narrow alleys as troops open fire
without warning.
   ``People were falling and screaming. I saw people carrying
wounded Tibetans on their backs, running into their houses and
trying to find some place to hide,'' said Ron Schwartz, a sociology
professor at the University of Newfoundland in St. Johns, Canada.
   The clash broke out Saturday in Lhasa when 30 Tibetans,
identified by the official Xinhua News Agency as Buddhist monks and
nuns, marched into a market with the banned Tibetan flag to
commemorate the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Declaration on Human
Rights. The protesters, dressed in street clothes and face masks,
demanded an end to 38 years of Chinese communist rule over the
Himalayan Mountain region.

   The Kingston House is holding lotteries these days
for beds, trying to be fair as it goes about meeting long lines at
the shelter each day. Even in New England, there's just no getting
used to the kinds of demands that record cold can put on people.
   The first blast of the 1988-89 winter season Monday brought a
record low for the date of 2 degrees, with most of the impact seen
at shelters.
   At the Kingston House, seven homeless people were in line as the
doors to the 60-bed shelter opened at 6:30 a.m. Phil Gonzalez, in
charge of admitting people to the shelter, said a lottery has been
held before noon in recent days for the beds. Those who lose out are
referred to other shelters or offered a blanket and the floor.
   Throughout the city Sunday night, about 75 people were
transported to shelters, and more were expected as the cold weather
continues, Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said.

   The nation's commercial banks enjoyed record
profits in the July-September quarter, but a top regulator sounded a
cautionary note Monday about an increase in bad loans and rising
bank involvement in leveraged corporate buyouts.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the 13,239 federally
insured commercial banks earned $5.9 billion in the third quarter,
topping the previous record of $5.8 billion in the same quarter last
year.
   ``I think we can say without much question that this year will be
an all-time high for banking profits,'' FDIC Chairman L. William
Seidman told reporters.
   The current record of $18.1 billion was set in 1985. Last year,
banks earned only $3.6 billion, the least profitable year since the
Depression, as they added heavily to reserves for losses on Third
World debt.

   Supporters of a substantial pay raise for
Congress are working behind the scenes to dampen potential
opposition and allow it to take effect automatically in February.
   But several lawmakers are lying in wait for the the perennially
prickly issue, and it appears unlikely to slide through without a
fight.
   ``I think we're all going to have a chance to face up to it,''
said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``Some of the members
are probably home working on their speeches now.''
   A presidential commission is due to recommend by Thursday boosts
in pay for Congress, 3,000 federal judges and top executive-branch
officials. The panel will meet Tuesday to discuss the proposed
raises, expected to be as much as 50 percent.

   Sonja Henie's icy heart won't be left out in
the cold when the warehouse where it has been stored for nearly 48
years is demolished to make room for a frozen foods plant.
   The blue-green ice sculpture was presented to the famous
Norweigian skater and movie star during a Valentine's Day 1941
performance at the Ak-Sar-Ben Coliseum _ the star's one and only
appearance in Omaha.
   Miss Henie said she would return for it some day. But she died in
1969 without ever claiming what CBS newsman Charles Kuralt once
called ``the longest-running, open-ended, most enduring publicity
stunt of all time.''
   Barney Oldfield, who was an Army publicist when he carved the
heart, said Miss Henie found her appearance in Omaha less than
heart-warming. Among other things, he said, she was upset that high
costs cut into her profits.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanians are fleeing, unemployment
is rising, the Panama Canal is suffering, the American military is
steaming and bank profits are falling.
   About the only firm thing in Panama is Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's grip on it.
   ``The country is going down the drain fast,'' said Ricardo Arias
Calderon, leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Party.
   He and Ruben Carles of the opposition newspaper La Prensa said up
to 40,000 Panamanians have left in 18 months. Unemployment is up
from 11 percent in 1987 to 23 percent. The treasury is in a bind and
public employees went on strike, demanding to be paid on time.
   The U.S. administrator for the Panama Canal says his job may not
be turned over to a Panamanian next year as required by the canal
treaty and that Washington's anti-Noriega sanctions indirectly
hinder operations at the canal, which is to be turned over to Panama
at midnight Dec. 31, 1999.
   In recent months, Noriega has imprisoned critics, changed
election laws to make it easier for himself to run for president in
May 1989 and closed four opposition newspapers, including La Prensa.
   The opposition is reduced to receiving news by facsimile machines
from the United States. ``Fax and photocopies, the No. 1 means of
communication,'' Carles said in an interview.
   Panama's trip down the chute began in June 1987 with allegations
that Noriega rigged the 1984 elections, laundered money and
trafficked in drugs and arms.
   Relations with the United States, traditionally close because of
the canal. took a nosedive last February when President Eric Arturo
Delvalle tried to fire Noriega as head of the 15,000-member Panama
Defense Forces. Noriega had the legislature dismiss Delvalle instead.
   Washingto refused to recognize the new president, Manuel Solis
Palma, and imposed economic sanctions in an effort to force Noriega
out.
   Six opposition parties recently signed a petition calling for
Noriega's ouster and formation of a transition government for
Panama's 2.2 million people.
   They have not yet decided whether to enter candidates in next
year's presidential election, nor has the general said whether he
will run.
   ``The people are scared to death,'' Carles said. ``How can we
have elections if everything is under Noriega's control?''
   Repeated calls were made to Noriega's spokesman, Maj. Edgardo
Lopez, and to leading members of the military-backed Democratic
Revolutionary Party but were not returned.
   Banks closed for nine weeks last March and figures issued by the
government indicated deposits at the more than 100 institutions
operating in Panama dropped from nearly $30 billion to just under $8
billion.
   U.S. sanctions put Panama in the same economic boat with Cuba and
Nicaragua, the other Latin American countries on which Washington
imposed boycotts, and compounded problems that began with the
political strife.
   ``This is one of the things that has really hurt the external
image,'' said Edgardo Lasso, president of the Panamanian Banking
Association, because ``the others are communist countries.''
   The government limited bank withdrawals, putting a $100 ceiling
on what could be withdrawn from savings accounts. Many Panamanians
stopped banking and sold certificates of deposit for less than
market value.
   Noriega has taken up the time-tested cry of Cuba and Nicaragua
about a threat of imminent U.S. invasion, except that in Panama's
case about 10,000 American soldiers already are in the country.
   Panama is headquarters for the U.S. Southern Command and the
soldiers, nominally stationed here for the purpose of defending the
canal, use the strategic location for intelligence gathering and spy
flights over Central America.
   Officers of the Southern Command claim Panamanian troops trespass
nightly on U.S. military facilities, and have reported exchanges of
fire in two dozen cases. A U.S. Marine was shot to death by a
comrade in April.
   ``The goal is to embarrass the United States and raise the level
of a sense of vulnerability,'' a U.S. official said.
   The 1977 Panama Canal treaties specify that the troops must leave
when the 50-mile-long waterway is turned over to Panama but an
accompanying pact requires the United States to assure
``indefinitely a regime providing for the permanent neutrality of
the canal.''
   Dennis McAuliffe, administrator of the Panama Canal Commission,
said the provision calling for a Panamanian to take over his job at
the end of 1989 is up in the air because the U.S. president must
approve the choice and anyone ``who bears the Noriega imprint will
never be acceptable.''
   McAuliffe said canal operations suffer somewhat because, under
the economic embargo, the canal commission cannot pay its Panamanian
employees' withholding taxes and the government has begun harassing
workers for the money.
   ``The fact is they are so nervous right now it's affecting morale
and that affects the efficiency of our operation,'' said McAuliffe,
a retired Army general.

<HEAD>Trouble at the Top of the Underworld in Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KOBE, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Each day children on their way home from
school calmly walk past the headquarters of Japan's largest
underworld syndicate, behind plastered beige walls in a classy
residential district overlooking the sea.
   Across town, a red-tiled building controlled by the gang is
within 100 yards of the Kobe District Courthouse. It bears the
golden, diamond-shaped logo of the gang, which leaders wear on their
lapels and which is printed on members' business cards.
   Over the past few years the Yamaguchi-gumi syndicate has waged a
successful war of revenge against a major rival, doubled its
membership and raked in millions of dollars annually, said Takashi
Ishii, assistant director of the National Police Agency's Organized
Crime Control Office
   But all is not well within the criminal empire.
   The year's business for the 20,000-member syndicate traditionally
starts Dec. 13, when ranking bosses gather at headquarters in this
western port city for a formal celebration called ``koto hajime'' _
the beginning of things.
   But since gang leader Masahisa Takenaka was killed by a splinter
group's gunman in 1985, custom has forced the Yamaguchi-gumi to
cancel the annual ceremony because it has no top don.
   Takenaka was replaced by two men, acting gang leader Kazuo
Nakanishi and ``young leader'' Yoshinori Watanabe, who led the gang
into a war to avenge Takenaka's killing, police say.
   Though that vendetta, which has left 25 dead and 70 injured by
police count, now seems to be nearing an end, police say the long
time without a leader has led to factionalism in the gang, weakening
its pyramid-style command structure.
   Public reaction to the high-profile violence has also plagued the
gang. Japan has low rates of violent crime and very strict
gun-control laws. But gunfights have brought attention to the gangs,
spawning grass-roots movements to rid residential areas of gang
headquarters and offices.
   A Yamaguchi-gumi subgang in the central Japanese city of
Hamamatsu was in the media spotlight until public opposition forced
it to relocate last year. The gang is now on the verge of collapse,
according to Ishii of the crime control office.
   But Masafumi Ueda, director of the office, said in an interview
that the public outcry and tough police crackdowns also may have
worked to the syndicate's benefit, putting many smaller gangs out of
business or forcing them to seek Yamaguchi-gumi protection.
   A recent issue of ``Endless Advance,'' an in-house journal
published by the Kyokuto Shinsei-kai, a large Tokyo syndicate,
attested to the trend toward consolidation.
   In the 120-page edition obtained by The Associated Press were
photos of top underworld figures gathered for dinner at a posh Tokyo
hotel to ``pursue friendly relations and cooperation'' and avoid
intergang trouble.
   Technically, the Yamaguchi-gumi has only 86 members, but each of
the top 86 controls a network of subordinate gangs, which, in turn,
have their own ``kasa'' _ Japanese for umbrella.
   Top bosses rarely face prosecution for serious crimes as
underlings take responsibility, sometimes even turning themselves
in, since doing prison time can bring a promotion.
   According to an annual report by the National Police Agency, more
than 86,000 gangsters in 3,201 gangs are spread across the country.
Roughly 40 percent belong to the big three nationwide syndicates _
the Yamaguchi-gumi, the Tokyo-based Sumiyoshi Rengo-kai and the
Inagawa-kai, also based in Tokyo.
   Ueda of the National Police Agency estimated total underworld
income at the yen equivalent of $15 billion annually, but he added
that ``is only a rough guess.''
   Yamaguchi-gumi income sources include gambling, the protection
racket, fraud, prostitution, money laundering and narcotics. These
and countless other scams are backed up by front operations in
construction, the stock market and real estate.
   Police believe the deaths of Hiroyuki Watanabe and his boss,
Kazuo Kengaku, an Osaka stock market speculator, are shadier
examples of what the Yamaguchi-gumi has done.
   The bodies of the men, who police allege had been kidnapped and
held for ransom, were dug up Oct. 18 _ entombed in a slab of
concrete. Two Yamaguchi-gumi affiliate members later confessed to
the crime.
   Meanwhile, Kobe residents seem to accept the Yamaguchi-gumi's
presence with a mixture of helplessness and inevitability.
   ``I've never had any trouble with gangsters, but I suppose I'd
prefer it if they'd leave,'' said a taxi driver. ``The thing is,
you'll never get rid of them.''

<BYLINE>European Lynx Brought Back To French Mountains</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THANNENKIRCH, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the spectacularly beautiful Vosges
Mountains of eastern France, half a dozen Czechoslovak lynxes
roaming the forest are the seed of a new population struggling for
survival against nature and man.
   For most of the people in this region of low mountains west of
the Rhine River, reintroduction of the European lynx into an area
from which it disappeared in the 19th century is a wonderful thing.
   ``But you only need two or three (people) against it, if those
two or three have rifles,'' said Patrick Barbier, secretary-general
of the Regional Association for the Protection of Nature.
   Perhaps only 3,000 to 3,500 European lynxes are left on the
Continent, and nearly all of them are in Eastern Europe, says
Veronique Herrenschmidt, head of France's lynx reintroduction
program.
   Of the 12 lynxes released in the Vosges in the past five years,
only six are alive, and perhaps not that many. It's difficult to
know now because the transmitter collars have ceased to function.
Some lynxes have been shot, either for sport or out of anger. One
was a female whose two young then died; others have just disappeared.
   Early next year, one last effort will be made. It's the final
cast of the dice for Miss Herrenschmidt, the French Ministry of
Environment, the National Office for Hunting and Wild Fauna and the
World Wildlife Fund, all participating in the program.
   Six more lynxes have been reserved in Czechoslovakia and are
being held there until the end of the French hunting season in
January. They then will be brought here, acclimated and freed.
   ``We haven't won yet,'' said Barbier. ``This is double or
nothing. We are going to put six more in and if that doesn't work
we'll have to rethink the whole program.''
   Success, according to Miss Herrenschmidt, a 32-year-old
agricultural engineer with a doctorate in ecology, ``will be when
there is reproduction in the Vosges and those lynxes themselves
become adult. Maybe in two or three years.''
   Opposition comes essentially from some hunters and farmers.
Hunters claim lynxes reduce the game population, particularly the
beautiful and tasty Vosges roe deer, and farmers worry about their
sheep.
   This region is mostly mountainous forest or vineyards, with few
sheep, so farmers are less of a problem. Even so, the World Wildlife
Fund reimburses farmers for the loss of domestic animals proven to
have been killed by lynxes, a protected species. Usually, there is
no mystery. A lynx's kill is a signature.
   ``It's always the same,'' said Miss Herrenschmidt. ``He kills by
strangling, biting his prey in the throat.''
   In France, where virtually every square foot of huntable land is
parceled out and leased, often at incredibly high prices, hunters
have a very proprietary view of wild game. Any reduction of roe
deer, for example, means fewer for the hunters to shoot.
   Nonetheless, the majority of hunters support the program.
   ``We accepted the reintroduction of the lynx on condition that if
it becomes prolific it will be opened for hunting,'' said Gilbert de
Turckheim, president of the Hunting Federation of the Lower Rhine.
   ``Here the price of hunting leases is very expensive,'' he said.
``Hunters have the right to question anything that affects the level
of game population.''
   Ecologists like Miss Herrenschmidt would argue that the lynxes
provide a service by culling out the weak, unfit animals, which in
the long run leads to a better, healthier deer.
   Like their predecessors, the new lynxes will be taken to a site
high in the Vosges, kept in large cages in the forest and fed wild
rabbits. After a month or two, the cages will be opened.
   The scientific aspect of the lynx program is to study the role of
``superpredators'' in the ecosystem of the area.
   ``This was seen as an experiment with the idea of introducing the
lynx into other zones in France,'' Miss Herrenschmidt said, adding
that the Vosges are ideal because each lynx needs about 75,000 to
125,000 acres, though zones may overlap.
   ``They have all they need to feed and reproduce,'' she added.
``The only problem is they must be respected _ and that means by man.
   ``The lynx must become a species like any other, like a deer or a
wild boar. The lynx must become integrated in the French forest.''

<TEXT>
   AL-SEEB, Oman (AP) _ ``Hut, hut,'' the young jockeys screeched,
whipping their camels with bamboo sticks as Oman's National Day
races started with a dozen ``ships of the desert'' thundering off at
a long-legged lope.
   Trainers and relatives of the diminutive jockeys, 5 to 14 years
old, roar down the side of the track in four-wheel-drive pickup
trucks and Toyotas, screaming instructions, yelling their riders on
in a cacophony of noise.
   Halfway down the two-mile, arrow-straight track 25 miles west of
the capital Muscat, senior government officials and sheiks dressed
in pristine white robes lounge in an open-sided tent sipping
cardoman-scented Arabic coffee and iced soft drinks served on silver
platters as the camels gallop past.
   There is no betting. It's forbidden in Islamic Oman. But there is
prestige for the owners of winning camels, specially bred as racing
steeds.
   Camel racing, once little more than a desert pastime, has become
a big sport in Oman and the other Arab states on the Persian Gulf,
patronized by the region's billionaire princes and sheiks. Racing
camels sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   An Omani breeder, Saeed Malki, earlier this year sold a
throughbred female racer to a sheik in the neighboring United Arab
Emirates for a record $155,000.
   Wealthy Arabs are spending millions of dollars in breeding racing
camels and in prize money during the November-April season, when the
searing desert temperatures cool to a tolerable 95 degrees.
   Prizes can be as high as $250,000 in some of the bigger meets,
particularly in the United Arab Emirates. In one race in Saudi
Arabia recently, some 600 camels took part.
   The sport has given camels a new lease of life. With the
helter-skelter modernization brought by the Persian Gulf's oil
riches, camels have largely become obselete as beasts of burden or
transportation in a region where just about everyone drives a car or
pickup.
   Once camels were also the Bedouin nomads' source of milk, hides
and often food. But even this has disappeared as many desert
dwellers moved to the towns. Some sheiks provide subsidies for camel
breeders.
   Oman's National Day races don't come near matching the Kentucky
Derby.
   The camels and their trainers, handlers and jockeys, who are
dressed in ragged robes or colored track suits, squat in the sand at
one end of the track, waiting their turn to race, hurling
good-natured insults at each other.
   A white-robed steward named Ahmad, curved Omani dagger in his
ornate silver belt, tried to maintain order while keeping in touch
with the finish line through a squalking walkie-talkie.
   The runners are selected. The handlers strap in the boy jockeys
behind the camels' humps with cloth straps and velcro pads so they
won't be hurled off.
   The starter's gun cracks and a dozen camels stampede from the
starting line.
   The handlers have to be agile to get out the way of the forest of
hooves. One middle-aged man was a little too slow and was trampled.
Stunned and shaken, but apparently with no broken bones, he was
carried to an ambulance.
   Sometimes, the jockeys do fall off. But they hit the ground with
a roll that a paratrooper would be proud of. There are bumps and
bruises, but no serious injuries.

   When Marlo Thomas accompanied her husband Phil
Donahue to Moscow last year, she had more in mind than sightseeing
in Red Square.
   The trip gave her the idea for what will be the first
Soviet-American co-production of an entertainment show, her special
``Free To Be ... A Family,'' airing Wednesday on ABC.
   ``It's an entertainment exchange between kids and superstar
performers from this country and the Soviet Union,'' Thomas said.
``We present our favorite performers and they present theirs. It's a
fun show of comedy and song, but the show also challenges
destructive stereotypes about families.
   ``Our goal is to show children that every family, no matter who's
in it or where they live, is a real family as long as its members
nurture and love each other.
   ``We also talk about the global family. It's no longer `we' and
`they,' we have to start thinking of `us.' Steve Martin talks about
feeding the entire world with one turkey and how big it was would
have to be. Carly Simon sings the song that became our theme, `Turn
of the Tide.' It says we are the turn of the tide and we have to
speak up.''
   The one-hour special is a sequel to ``Free To Be ... You and
Me,'' which won Peabody and Emmy awards in 1974.
   Thomas made arrangements for the special while her husband was
taping a week's worth of his syndicated talk show ``Donahue'' in the
Soviet Union.
   ``Free To Be ... A Family'' was put together later by means of a
satellite hookup between the Hard Rock Cafe in New York and
Gosteleradio Studios in Moscow.
   Thomas is host of the special in New York and Tatiana Vedeneyeva
is host in Moscow. Among the American performers are rock group Bon
Jovi, actress Whoopi Goldberg, comic magicians Penn and Teller,
singer-songwriter Carly Simon, comedians Lily Tomlin and Robin
Williams, and Muppets Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
   ``We started work on the special last September,'' said Thomas.
``It was very complicated to put together. This is the first jointly
produced American-Soviet entertainment program. ... We have 40
Soviet kids and 40 American kids, and we sing over the `space
bridge' satellite. The kids were selected a year ago and got to know
each other by exchanging letters and photos.''
   A ``Free To Be ... A Family'' book was published in 1987, and
half a million copies have been sold. An album featuring many of the
stars on the special was issued last month.
   ``Soviet rock star Vladimir Prezhnikof is on the show. I was
surprised to learn the Russians dance to the same dance steps we do
and know more about us than we know about them. They know all of our
rock stars and see our movies.''
   Thomas said the first project, ``Free To Be ... You and Me'' was
an attempt to rewrite children's literature to eliminate sexual and
ethnic stereotypes.
   ``There were too many stories about Prince Charming coming along
and carrying the girl off,'' she said. ``I wanted to liberate the
definition of boy and girl the way we had liberated the definition
of men and women. The new book liberates the definition of the
family and expands its meaning.''
   With the special completed, Thomas is now on to other things.
She's just completed a comedy-mystery called ``In the Spirit.'' It
co-stars Elaine May, Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis.
   ``Elaine plays a Hollywood wife, and I'm a New Age health food
store owner who thinks all the world's problems would be solved if
people would just stop eating meat,'' she said. ``We're being chased
by someone who thinks we know about a murder.''
   Next, she will star in a feature film for Twentieth Century-Fox
called ``A Point of Light.'' It's a story of a rural family and
probably will be filmed in Vermont.
   She will also co-star with her father, Danny Thomas, in a CBS
drama called ``Deception.'' She said, ``We play father and
daughter,'' he said. ``We look alike so what else could we play?''

<HEAD>Portable Phones are All the Rage in Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rage of Hong Kong these days is easy to
spot. Just look for the tiny antennas, the telltale sign of the
portable telephones so many people are carrying wherever they go.
   Despite price tags of $2,000 or more, the hand-held telephones
have become a huge hit in this British colony, where doing business
is a 24-hour preoccupation and new status symbols are always in
demand.
   Downtown streets are filled with professionals ready for business
with the cellular phones tucked under their arms or stuffed,
antenna-up, into briefcases.
   Away from the financial district, people can be seen barking into
the phones while eating in restaurants, riding public buses and
ferries, or sitting in darkened movie theaters. Everyone from
executives to proprietors of produce stalls can be seen chatting
away.
   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper spotted a telephone in a recent
100-kilometer (62-mile) charity walk along a rural trail.
   ``In driving rain and a lashing wind, a young man was spotted
eagerly and conspicuously talking into his mobile telephone,'' it
said.
   ``In a more normal society one would expect (him) to hand the
phone over to one of his seconds before starting the race. (But) a
few kilometers down the track, the young man was spotted merrily
informing the financial markets at large of his continued
existence.''
   The government estimates about 60,000 portable cellular
telephones _ roughly six times earlier projections _ will be in use
by the end of the year in this territory of 5.7 million people, said
Deputy Postmaster General Henry Wise, whose department is in charge
of telecommunications.
   While most cellular telephones sold in other countries are for
use in cars, roughly three-fourths of the units sold in Hong Kong
since the market opened three years ago have been the more expensive
handheld models.
   ``We were amazed when the whole thing really took off in a great
way,'' Wise said.
   Hutchison Telephone Co, which has sold about 26,000 cellular
telephones, recently stopped sales for six weeks because demand was
outpacing the company's capacity to handle all the calls.
   ``The market just caught everybody by surprise,'' said Peter
Grant, president of China Telephone Co. Ltd., a rival firm. ``We're
all frantically rebuilding networks,''
   Harry Hui, a psychology lecturer at the University of Hong Kong,
attributed the popularity of the telephones here in part to ``the
importance of face. It's a status symbol.''
   Wise believes the Hong Kong work ethic of doing business whenever
and wherever possible is largely responsible for the tremendous
sales.
   ``Virtually the whole day is part of the working day,'' he said.
   Although industry officials see no end in sight to demand for the
telephones, their indiscriminate use in public places already is
viewed as an irritation by some.
   ``People are becoming aware of the annoyance factor,''
acknowledged Grant.
   Several exclusive clubs demand that their patrons and guests
check their telephones at the door.

<HEAD>ROCKLAND, Maine: PTSD units.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Thus far, however, the government has refused to commit its own
resources, forcing Rheault to raise $40,000 to $50,000 a year from
veterans' organizations, foundations, corporations and individual
donors.
   He has appeared before Congress and regularly speaks at PTSD
conferences, hopeful that the VA will eventually embrace the program
as an effective means of helping the war's psychological casualties,
most of whom are now in their early 40s.
   ``They're on a knife edge,'' Rheault says. ``If they fall off on
one side, they'll be OK. If they fall off on the other side, they'll
be alcoholics, bums, suicides, jailbirds or long-term mental
patients _ at a tremendous cost to society.''
   The Outward Bound course is demanding, he says, but those who
complete it are more likely to progress than those who remain
institutionalized throughout their treatment.
   While there is no scientific data on the effectiveness of the
program, the director of psychiatry at the VA Medical Center in
Northampton says participation in Outward Bound has been shown to
make patients more amenable to other aspects of the treatment
process.
   PTSD patients are distrustful, aloof and unable to interact with
others, Dr. William Boutelle explains, citing a symptom known as
``emotional numbing.''
   ``It's as if there is Novocain in their emotions,'' he says.
   The courses, Boutelle says, re-create the camaraderie and mutual
dependence shared by soldiers during combat, encouraging the
veterans to open up to each other as they sit around a campfire and
share their successes and failures during the climb.
   Rheault blames institutionalized bureaucracy within the VA for
the slow pace at which the program is being accepted.
   ``If, during all of this time, I had merely been butting my head
against the brick wall of the VA, I would have given up long ago,''
he says. ``But while we were waiting for the glacier to move, we
have helped vets.''
   At VA headquarters in Washington, a spokeswoman said a study is
under way among patients at the Tacoma and Augusta centers to gauge
the effectiveness of patient participation in Outward Bound.
   ``The veterans who are involved in the program have very positive
feelings about it, but no one has done a study to determine the
therapeutic effect of it, and that is what they are doing right
now,'' said the spokeswoman, Donna St. John.
   Positive changes in America's attitude toward Vietnam veterans,
many of whom were greeted with hostility or indifference when they
first returned home, have created a climate of greater acceptance
and a willingness to deal with such lingering problems as
post-traumatic stress, according to Rheault.
   The Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, he said, was part of a
symbolic change in which ``the people were able to separate the war
from the warrior.''
   ``On balance, it is a more accepting society, and the Vietnam
vets now dare say they were there, and that's OK,'' he says.
   Rheault's belief in the war waned as the U.S. military buildup
peaked during the late 1960s, pushing counter-insurgency efforts to
the background and de-emphasizing the social, economic, political
and psychological aspects of the struggle.
   The turning point came when American troops shifted from an
advisory role and became the chief defenders of the Saigon regime,
he says.
   ``Interestingly, in 1964-65 nobody called Vietnamese `gooks.' But
by 1968, everybody did,'' he says.
   To Rheault, the rigorous climb up the mountain while shouldering
heavy packs typifies the trail the veterans must take if they are to
overcome their deep-seated problems.
   The climb is deliberately evocative of the Vietnam experience,
placing squad-size groups of veterans in an unfamiliar wilderness
environment where they help and encourage each other to reach the
top.
   ``I maintain that the war was evil, stupid and immoral, but their
experience as human beings _ experiences of courage, self-sacrifice
and brotherhood _ that was all valid stuff,'' Rheault says.
   ``The mountain is a great metaphor. You climb it a step at a
time. You can't see the mountain. You can only see a few feet of the
trail.
   ``If you could see the whole mountain, it would be too
intimidating to climb. But since you can only see a little bit of
it, you take a few steps. And eventually, you're up there.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ As late as the 1930s, about two in five
Jordanians were nomadic Bedouins. Today the government estimates the
number at less than one in 20. While many Bedouins still refuse to
abandon their culture, the lure of modern conveniences and
government services is putting the brakes on a society that has been
on the move for thousands of years.

<DATELINE>AL FEIDA, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A way of life 6,000 years old is fading
away in the Arabian desert as nomadic Bedouin tribesmen settle down.
Today's ``ships of the desert'' are trucks, not camels.
   ``It is dying, and it's a shame,'' says Sheik Mohammed Trad
al-Shaalan, leaning against a pillow in a woven tent open to a
sprawling vista of the barren Jordanian desert.
   Shaalan is a leader of the Rwallah tribe, which has roamed for
hundreds of years across land now divided by the borders of Syria,
Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.
   Of some 200,000 Rwallah clansmen, ``I would say less than 5
percent are still moving, even less than that,'' the sheik says.
   Shaalan says perhaps a third of them are partly nomadic, the
women or children living in town while the husband lives in a tent
and follows the herds of goats and sheep.
   As Shaalan speaks, about 100 camels slowly glide by in the
distance, led by a Rwallah tribesman. Shalaan's own four-wheel drive
vehicle with custom wheel rims is parked beside the tent, not far
from the perch of two tethered hunting falcons.
   The camel has become more a status symbol than a necessity. Today
trucks kick up plumes of dust over the hard-floored Jordanian desert
miles from any roads. They carry water, livestock and tents from one
site to another, making it easier for Bedouins to reach their herds
from fixed campsites or villages, many of which have sprung up
around wells and schools provided by governments throughout the
region.
   Greater mobility and government services have encouraged the
Bedouins to settle _ as have a long drought and the problems of
crossing borders.
   ``As people are able to travel farther, they don't have to move
as much in terms of their residences,'' says Don Henry, a University
of Tulsa paleontologist who has lived among modern-day Bedouins in
Jordan while studying their ancestors.
   ``Women always like to get away from the hardship of living in a
tent and moving every day or every week and having to collect
branches for cooking fires,'' Shaalan says. ``They prefer to be
living in a house with electricity and gas ovens and to have bread
coming from the bakery.''
   Um Khader, a Bedouin woman in the hills south of Amman agrees.
``Oh lord, how I love the cement house,'' she says. ``I'm rid of the
dust.''
   About two in five Jordanians were nomadic Bedouins in the 1920s
and 1930s. Today, the government estimates that less than one in 20
still follows the old way of life.
   ``I think what you're seeing is the last of the Mohicans,'' says
Kamel Abu Jaber, a University of Jordan political scientist who led
a survey of Bedouins in the late 1970s.
   ``It never crossed my mind to leave the tent and live in a
house,'' says Sheik Ahmad Hamadi al-Guesam. ``I like the freedom. I
like the peace. I want to die in this black tent.''
   But like many Bedouins, al-Guesam says he keeps his children in a
nearby town, where they can go to school. Two have already graduated
and joined the army, a favored occupation for a martial people who
once treated raiding as a sort of sport.
   Inside his black goat-hair tent, the sheik offers visitors the
cardamon-spiced Bedouin coffee and repeated cups of sugary tea from
pots kept steaming on the fragrant bed of coals before him.
   A pet cat stalks out from behind a bamboo screen that sets off
the women's quarters within. The sound of small children giggling
and chatting drifts through the reeds.
   Shaalan, in addition to his tent, has a house in remote Al-Feida
and sends his children to school in Amman, where he says they are
closer to health care and other services.
   Shaalan himself studied management at Biscayne College in Miami,
a Catholic school since renamed St. Thomas University.
   Henry says nomadic herders broke away into the desert from small
farming settlements in Jordan some 6,000 years ago, although it is
unclear if those ancient people were the same as today's Bedouins.
   Even so, he says, ``It's just uncanny the number of parallels you
see between 6,000-year-old camps and the ones you see occupied
today.''
   Camels arrived perhaps 2,000 to 1,500 B.C., making it possible
for the nomads to range farther into the arid expanses of Arabia.
   Scholars say the Bedouins have developed a complex and
sophisticated culture while living beyond the reach of governments.
Their complicated system of unwritten laws, based on intensely felt
honor and hospitality, operates even today alongside formal laws.
   Crimes such as murder or rape once could lead to bloodshed and
still often today require restitution to the victim _ an element
often missing in Western law.
   Shaalan says the offenders also might be banished from the tribe,
a stiff penalty in a society where identity is based on the clan.
   For lesser crimes, a man ``would be disgraced, not be presented
with a cup of coffee in a group like this...His sister would not be
married to a dignified person,'' Shaalan says.
   But the sheik says the old ways are eroding as Bedouins settle.
   ``Living in a city has made people lose a great deal of their
dignity, generosity, truth in dealings...They have acquired the bad
habits of the city,'' Shaalan complains.
   In the city, ``people are becoming very busy, so generosity is
lost...You can't just come to a tent and enter and whoever is there
serves you food and coffee.''
   Shaalan compares Bedouin virtues to those of rural Americans.
   ``I really felt as if I was in a Bedouin society when I was in
Oregon in the country, when I was in Tennessee close to the Smokey
Mountains,'' he says. ``When I went to the big cities, I felt like I
was in a jungle.''
   Bedouin values, even weakened, continue to permeate Arab society.
Hospitality is prized. Families are tight, and behavior is bound by
codes of honor. Consensus is preferred to majority rule.
   ``I'm fairly convinced that being Bedouin is not a way of life at
all. Its a political ideology,'' says William Lancaster, a British
anthropologist who spent several years living with the Rwallah.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He worked his way through college as a midget in
sideshows at fairs and expositions. He became a living trademark for
a national brand of wieners. But the highpoint of Meinhardt Raabe's
career came when he landed the role of a Munchkin in ``The Wizard of
Oz.''

<TEXT>
   There are no yellow brick roads or
wicked witches in this North Florida retirement community, but there
is a fugitive from the land of Oz.
   He's a Munchkin, name of Meinhardt Raabe.
   Although it's been half a century, Raabe can still repeat the
lines he sang as the Munchkin coroner in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' the
1939 movie classic starring Judy Garland.
   When the tornado dropped the house on the wicked witch, it was
Raabe, carrying a large death certificate, who sang, ``She's not
only merely dead, she's most sincerely dead.''
   The coroner had one of the nine speaking roles for the 116 little
people who played Munchkins in the movie based on L. Frank Baum's
books.
   At the time the movie was filmed, Raabe was promoting Oscar Mayer
wieners as ``Little Oscar _ The World's Smallest Chef.''
   He took a two-month leave of absence and headed for Hollywood,
where he was given the role in ``The Wizard Of Oz.''
   Raabe was 22 years old and only 46 inches tall. He had worked his
way through college in midget shows at fairs. He's since grown to
4-foot-7.
   When the film was made, Raabe says he had no idea it would become
a classic. He was only familiar with the scenes in which he played.
   ``We didn't know what came before or what came after,'' he says.
``We had no idea what the picture was all about until we saw it
released.
   ``At the time of its release, it was overshadowed by `Gone With
The Wind.'''
   ``Gone With The Wind'' won four Academy Awards, including best
picture that year.
   ``It was only after CBS got the film in 1956 and used it for
their promotions that it became as well known,'' he says.
   Now retired and living in this community established by J.C.
Penney, Raabe, 73, believes the movie has become an enduring classic
because people saw it as children and still remember it.
   ``That's one factor, but the second basic factor is there is
nothing in the picture that dates it,'' he says. ``There are no old
vintage cars or old vintage streetcars and it's a fantasy picture
that will be fantasy for generations to come.
   ``I have so many middle-aged people come up to me and say, `I
just bought the video of ``The Wizard of Oz'' for my grandchildren.'
But after talking to them, you realize that it was they themselves
who were most interested because it was nostalgia for them.''
   Although Raabe leads an active life as the horticulturist at
Penney Farms, he and his wife, Marie, often travel to Oz reunions,
including a recent one in Chesterton, Ind.
   ``One of the reasons why the Munchkins are getting attention is
that all the major stars of the picture are gone, so there are just
a few of us Munchkins left,'' Raabe says.
   There are fewer than 30 former Munchkins still living.
   ``It was 50 years ago and I was one of the younger ones,'' he
says. ``Many of them were 30 and 40 years older than I was at time.''
   Raabe says being involved in the movie was the experience of a
lifetime.
   ``For a young man of 22 from a farm in Wisconsin to be in that
atmosphere was naturally a big thrill,'' Raabe said. He got to meet
Judy Garland and many of the other top stars at MGM.
   When the little people chosen to play Munchkins were hired, each
was measured for a costume. While the costumes were made, the
Munchkins rehearsed their parts.
   ``As we marched, we had to be on a certain yellow brick on a
certain note. We were all well-rehearsed. So when the costumes were
finished, we were ready to do the shooting,'' he says.
   Work began at 6 a.m. each day and continued until 8 p.m. each
night.
   Raabe says he can't remember what he was paid for his role in the
movie, but remembers it was very low.
   ``By today's standards, people would say you were crazy to work
for that,'' he says.
   Raabe, born in Watertown, Wis. in 1915, was a member of the
Midget City cast at the Chicago World's Fair in 1934. He also
performed at the San Diego Exposition in 1935 and the Texas
Centennial and Cleveland Great Lakes World's Fair in 1936.
   ``By working at these world's fairs as a midget, I was able to
work my way through the university,'' Raabe says. He holds both a
bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Wisconsin and
a master's degree in business administration from Drexel University.
   Raabe says some short people resent the word ``midget,'' but that
was the description widely used when he was in show business.
   ``My wife and I were both in show business, were both midgets. My
wife worked from 1929 to 1932 as a member of Rose's Royal Midgets,
the largest midget troupe in vaudeville,'' he says. They have been
married for 43 years.
   When Raabe graduated from college, he was unable to get a job as
an accountant because of his size.
   But his size worked to his advantage when he was hired as
``Little Oscar, the World's Smallest Chef'' _ a job he held for 30
years.
   Raabe, who wore a chef's uniform, traveled around the country
doing cooking shows, school shows, lectures and handing out samples.
   ``I was on the road all the time, I never had an office job,'' he
says. ``We were constantly on the road traveling.''
   When ``The Wizard of Oz'' was released in 1939, Raabe performed a
double duty.
   ``I traveled with the picture for six months,'' he says. ``I was
being paid by Oscar Mayer. I was getting the little promotion bit
ahead of the picture and we passed out wiener samples in the lobby
at the end.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It stands as a symbol of the Old South, named for

of Vicksburg in it's new incarnation is also becoming a symbol of
the New South, an industrial park and high-tech center in a state
struggling to polish its image.

   The family of a prominent Confederate
minister fled to the old Ceres Plantation when Union gunboats began
the Civil War siege of Vicksburg, bringing along what was reputed to
be the biggest library in the South.
   Yankee soldiers who later sacked the mansion used those books to
``pave'' the muddy road to the Big Black River.
   Today, Yankees or anyone else with bucks to invest in high-tech
businesses are welcome at the former cotton plantation.
   The Old South is merging with the New South on the plantation's
1,300 acres, which have been acquired by the Warren County Port
Commission for development into an industrial park.
   The two-story, country-style antebellum home was named for the
goddess of agriculture. Now it is being offered as a potential
corporate headquarters in a state trying to diversify its economy.
 ers to clear away the debris.
   ``Bodies were ripped apart and the trains were tangled
together,'' said firefighter Chris Fitzgerald. ``We had to use our
heaviest cutting gear and it was like nibbling away at the wreckage
just a little at a time.''
   Among the first rescuers were boys from nearby Emanuel College.
   ``We just heard a crunch, just like metal going together,'' said
Henry Livesey, 12, a student at the private school. ``I saw a man
with metal stuck in his head. He was obviously dead.''
   Chris Reeves, 38, of Southampton, was in the buffet car when the
crash happened. ``There was furniture and enormous lumps of metal
flying everywhere,'' he said as he waited for treatment at St.
George's Hospital. ``All I can remember is dust and debris as you've
never experienced it in your life.''
   ``The whole of the buffet car disintegrated,'' Reeves said. ``The
roof split open like a ripe tomato and that's how we got out. We
tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much
debris, there was nothing we could do.''
   Ian Underhill, 41, of Farnborough, said there was ``a hell of a
bang'' as his train approached Clapham.
   ``The train seemed to shoot backwards and the guy opposite me
flew into my face,'' said Underhill, who also was taken to St.
George's. ``Amazingly enough, there was not a lot of panic. It was
fairly calm and people were helping one another to get out. I saw
one man helped out who had lost his foot and there were many others
with terrible injuries.''
   Mike Clarke, 41, of Northbourne, said the restaurant car ``just
disintegrated.
   ``The roof just split open and the bogey (the wheels) came up
through the floor,'' he said.
   Keith Larner, 36, from Southampton, said ``there were people
underneath me and under the metal and there were people with metal
in their bodies.
   ``A woman was trapped with metal which was in her chest and we
just started to get people out immediately. It was the most horrible
sight I have ever seen.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's a place for aspiring women writers like the
Pennsylvania mother of seven who wrote that ``there hasn't been much
opportunity for quiet in my life.'' And if they get an invitation to
the writers' colony at Hedgebrook Farm on Puget Sound, it won't cost
them a cent. It's all a gift from a woman who believes that people
of her gender deserve to be heard.

<TEXT>
   A quaint farm on an island in Puget Sound
has been converted into a retreat for women who want to write and
think and dream in solitude, beyond the press of family and jobs.
   The writer's colony at Hedgebrook Farm, which began receiving its
first authors-in-residence in August, is the creation of Nancy
Skinner Nordhoff, the 56-year-old daughter of a shipping executive
who has long been active in community affairs in the Seattle area.
   ``Women need the chance to explore their craft without having to
wait until the kids are in college,'' says Nordhoff, a 1954 graduate
of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass. ``Women have
something important to say, they need to be heard.''
   Women writers selected by a screening committee can spend two
weeks to two months at Hedgebrook Farm free of charge. Nordhoff
bought the farm with her own money _ she declines to say how much _
and foots all the bills.
   Why?
   ``It's a gift to myself and to the writers,'' she says. ``It's
because I know from my own life the pain of not being affirmed. You
know, I have the ability, I have the interest to be able to say
women deserve to be heard and to be able to do something about it.''
   The 30-acre farm, 30 miles north of Seattle on Whidbey Island,
has a remodeled yellow stucco farmhouse and two timber-framed,
skylighted cabins, with four others in the works.
   Every day a picnic basket lunch is delivered to each writer's
doorstep, ``with just a loud enough thump so that they know it's
there,'' Nordhoff says.
   Almost every article in the cabins is hand-crafted, from the
porcelain sink basins to the pillows and afghan for curling up next
to three ground-level windows. A loft and bed look out stained-glass
windows into the trees.
   None of the cabins' windows faces other cabins. Nordhoff says
they were designed that way so writers would feel ``separate, but
not isolated.''
   The cabins were designed by architect Chuck Dougherty, a
University of Washington graduate who now designs structures for the
Amish in Lancaster County, Pa.
   Writers are afforded solitude all day but eat dinner in the
farmhouse at a big wooden table looking out over Puget Sound, along
with Nordhoff and the ``farm family'' of carpenters, cooks and other
friends.
   ``It's a place where people can work the way they've always
wanted to,'' says Sheryl Feldman, 47, of Sommerville, Mass., a
non-fiction writer.
   Nordhoff gave up her long career as a community activist to
develop the farm.
   ``It was meetings, meetings, meetings, all the time,'' Nordhoff
says. ``Too much formality and ritual.''
   Nordhoff had been instrumental in forming the City Club, a United
Way volunteer bureau. She also served on Bellevue's Overlake
Hospital board and was president of the Seattle Junior League.
   Nordhoff says that after traveling around the country in a van,
she realized she felt most at home in the country, with her hands in
the dirt.
   She bought the farm as ``something for me,'' and as something she
wanted to share.
   Nordhoff, who now grows vegetables in her Hedgebrook garden,
co-wrote a book on fund-raising for non-profit organizations. But
she says she doesn't consider herself a writer.
   She says the idea for Hedgebrook came from a visit to the
McDowell writers' colony in New Hampshire. She liked the colony,
which is for published writers, but wondered where people who hadn't
published anything could go.
   ``The idea for Hedgebrook became attractive to me,'' Nordhoff
says. ``A place where I could say, `I care about women writers and
support what you are doing _ even if you haven't been published.'''
   A selection committee composed of five writers recommended to
Nordoff by bookstore owners, English professors and librarians,
screens the applicants. Two of the five are men. Nordhoff says they
look for women who are dedicated to being a writer. ``We want people
who can't not write,'' she says.
   An applicant must submit a sample of her writing and a letter
saying why she feels a stay at Hedgebrook Farm would be important
for her work.
   Letters from women have been pouring into Hedgebrook:
   ``I have seven children and there hasn't been much opportunity
for quiet in my life,'' wrote a Pennsylvania woman who wants to
write poetry.
   A 42-year-old counselor for disabled people in New Mexico wrote:
``I have been writing poetry since I was a teen-ager. For a long
time I put my work as a counselor first, but now I realize I need to
nurture parts of me I had previously set aside.''
   Although Nordhoff started out advertising mainly through local
networks, she is now receiving applications from all over the
country.
   She hopes to eventually accept writers from different locations,
but for now is focusing on writers from the Northwest.
   Fourteen writers were in residence at some time during the first
session that ended Dec. 10. The next session, which runs from Jan.
10 to June 30, can accommodate 18.
   Residents have included Judith Barringer, a published poet from
Portland, Ore., who used her stay to finish a second book of poems.
   Sharon Hashimoto of Seattle, who stayed for a month, used her
time to pull together a book of poems and write several short
stories. A science-fiction writer finished a couple of chapters.
   Writers choose how long they want to stay _ anywhere from a week
to two months.
   ``I feel fortunate to be able to do this,'' Nordhoff says.
``Helping an artist do her work _ that's the joy.''

``Annie McGuire.'' The show is near the bottom of the weekly Nielsen
ratings, along with ``The Van Dyke Show,'' a new effort by her
former co-star in ``The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in the 1960s.
   She's struggling to survive in a ratings war that has changed
radically since she reigned in the 1970s with ``The Mary Tyler Moore
Show.'' Independent stations, syndicated shows, cable, pay channels,
video cassettes and the upstart Fox Broadcasting Co. are all
relatively new combatants in the ratings war. CBS, now mired
ingloriously in third place, no longer brags that it's the Tiffany
Network.
   ``You can't run away from it because it's tough,'' says Moore,
whose last situation comedy, ``Mary,'' and two attempts at a variety
show failed. ``Acting is what I do for a living. By that, I mean I
live to act. As long as I'm healthy enough I want to find a medium
to express myself. I hope to be playing old ladies in the near
future.
   ``It has nothing to do with money. It has to do with the joy one
has in plying one's trade. This is fun for me. It's rewarding.''
   Moore obviously does not need the money. She's quite wealthy from
the sale of MTM Enterprises, which she co-founded with former
husband Grant Tinker, to Britain's TVS. She retains a 20 percent
ownership.
   Eight years ago she moved to New York for the stage play ``Whose
Life Is It, Anyway?,'' then decided to stay. She has been married
for the past five years to a New York cardiologist, Dr. S. Robert
Levine. They also have a home in New York's Duchess County, where
Moore says she has discovered such pastimes as gardening, walking
and horseback riding.
   ``I've become almost bucolic,'' she says.
   Still, Moore, who professes she gets homesick for New York the
instant she crosses the Hudson River, is back in L.A. doing another
sitcom.
   Moore, wearing a red warm-up suit with her hair cut stylishly
short, is sitting on a couch in her trailer parked outside Stage 3
at the MTM Studios. It's the same trailer she used for ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show'' and was also once used by Judy Garland.
   Up close, despite her diabetic condition and too many years spent
exposing her skin to the California sun, she looks as good as her
bank account. She credits this to a change in lifestyle. She has
quit smoking, does light impact aerobics and has adopted a healthier
diet.
   In ``Annie McGuire,'' Moore is a woman who works for the
Manhattan borough president, has a teen-age son and remarries a
structural engineer with a son and daughter. She has a mother
(Eileen Heckart) who's an ultra-liberal activist, and her new
husband (Denis Arndt) has a father (John Randolph) who's a staunch
conservative.
   The stories are a little different from the usual sitcom fare. In
one show she's held up by a man in a wheelchair, then feels
obligated to find him a job. In another, her husband admits to
having had an affair with his late wife's sister. Once, she had to
clear her father-in-law's reputation from an old accusation that
food poisoning in his restaurant cost Thomas E. Dewey the presidency.
   ``We're breaking a few molds,'' she says. ``We do some outlandish
things and conduct ourselves like adults having a great time.''
   It's Moore's first one-camera show without an audience since she
displayed only her legs as ``Sam'' on ``Richard Diamond, Private
Detective,'' in 1959. She says she finds it a much easier way to
work.
   ``CBS had asked me to come back and do another series after the
last attempt failed,'' she says. ``We wanted Elliot Shoenman, who
had been on `The Cosby Show,' to create the show. We talked over
various concepts for about a year.
   ``We did miscast a very talented actor (Edward J. Moore) as my
husband. He was replaced by Denis Arndt. And the first show turned
out a little broader than what we had in mind. But that's what CBS
saw and this put us in at 8:30 p.m. after Dick Van Dyke's new show,
which is very broad.''
   The writers strike gave them time to think it over. The first
show was scrapped and the first show on the air was actually the
second show. Moore says she wants CBS to move the show because she
feels its adult content deserves a later time slot.
   Moore realizes it's impossible to avoid comparisons to Mary
Richards, her character in ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show.''
   ``But Annie is radically different from Mary Richards,'' she
says. ``Annie's more mature, more creative and not as compulsive.
She can have a wrinkle in her skirt or a stain on her blouse.
Annie's a care-giver, she gives of herself to other people. She's
not terribly organized. She's a little cynical. She's
free-spirited.''

   Nancy Marchand can speak with authority about
very proper WASP matrons.
   ``I know a lot of those ladies,'' says the actress who grew up in
an upper middle-class family in Buffalo, N.Y. ``The way they lived
is the way I lived.''
   Proper is how many audiences view Miss Marchand, too, from her
role as the no-nonsense, wealthy, newspaper publisher Mrs. Pynchon
on television's ``Lou Grant'' to the befuddled mayor in this
season's surprise movie success ``The Naked Gun'' to her latest
stage role, an upper-crust matriarch with a fierce family loyalty in
the off-Broadway hit, ``The Cocktail Hour.''
   The play, written by A.R. Gurney, gets its title from that
particular time of day, usually before dinner, when drinks and good
conversation are served. But in this case, the conversation is not
so agreeable.
   A son has returned home to ask his parents' permission to present
a play he has written about them. Miss Marchand plays the mother, a
peacemaker who tries to soften the generational squabbles, and she
walked off with glowing notices from the critics.
   The actress has worked before with Gurney, who also comes from
Buffalo and from the same upper-class WASP society. It's a society
Gurney has written about before in such plays as ``The Dining
Room,'' ``The Middle Ages'' and ``The Perfect Party.''
   ``Often when a playwright is writing a play, there comes a point
when he wants to hear it,'' says Miss Marchand, sitting in the
living room of her Upper West Side apartment. ``So I've done a lot
of readings of his plays. And when I read `The Cocktail Hour,' I
thought, `It's the best play he's written.'''
   The actress knew she had to play this woman and drew the
character from her memories of other women, her mother and even
herself. But don't ask her to explain how.
   ``This is very hard for me to talk about because it's all kind of
subliminal,'' she says with a laugh.
   ``What I do is sit down right away and learn the role. That's
when I make a lot of discoveries about the character. I get so
involved that I become that person. I know that sounds silly, but I
really do.''
   For Miss Marchand, ``The Cocktail Hour'' has turned into
particularly gratifying employment. It will keep her in New York for
a while. For much of her career, she needed to travel for work.
   Still she has managed to maintain what she calls ``a real
household'' in New York. It includes her husband, actor Paul Sparer,
recently seen off-Broadway as the father in the hit play ``A Shayna
Maidel.'' The couple raised three children, now grown.
   Even when she was filming ``Lou Grant'' in California, Miss
Marchand was able to shoot most of her scenes in one day and come
back to New York for the remainder of the week.
   ``My husband was here and my youngest daughter was just finishing
up high school,'' she says. ``This is my home. But the producers
were very good to me.''
   Miss Marchand also had the luck of appearing in what was a
quality television show.
   ``The topics that it dealt with were interesting and
thought-provoking,'' she says. ``So it was a challenge for me.''
   So was the character. In one episode early in the series' run,
Mrs. Pynchon had a stroke, Miss Marchand recalls. The illness gave
her an opportunity to explore the character further.
   She began using a cane for the role, something she carried over
to later episodes, and then added other stroke-related
characteristics to the woman's personality, like her having trouble
remembering things.
   For most of her career, Miss Marchand has had to juggle family
and career.
   There were stretches of 12-hour days when husband and wife never
stopped running between family and career, particularly when they
both were members of the APA-Phoenix repertory company in the 1960s.
   ``After working five or six hours rehearsing, then rushing home
and getting dinner on the table and listening to problems about
trigonometry or getting kids bathed and ready for bed, it cleaned
out that period of time for me emotionally,'' she recalls. ``I could
go back to the theater fresh and ready to do a show.''
   It was good for the children, too.
   `It made them more independent and helped them get along
together,'' she says. Now they have left home and she can
concentrate on her career.
   ``I love the work so I'm not averse to doing something that isn't
necessarily going to reflect my 35 years in the business,'' she says.
   A year ago, she was Klytemnestra in a production of ``Elektra''
by Ezra Pound at a miniscule off-off-Broadway theater for a
miniscule salary. ``If it interests me, I'll do it.''
   Right now, she still is fascinated by ``The Cocktail Hour,''
striving to make the production and her performance better.
   ``Although it's a play of language, it's economical,'' she says.
``Because language is so specific, you can't fool around with the
words, changing them or changing the syntax because you will change
the rhythm and often change the meaning. That is the hardest thing
to do _ to get the words absolutely perfect.
   ``The woman I play is very smart about dealing with the rhythms
of the family,'' Miss Marchand says. ``Quite early on in the play,
she says, `I want to know what I missed,' and discovers what she
missed was not very good. So she immediately drops it and then picks
up and approaches it from a totally different point of view. But
it's all done, I hope, as smooth as silk. She calms the waters.''

<HEAD>At The Movies: ``Rain Man,'' ``The Naked Gun''</HEAD>

   ``Rain Man''
   
   The autistic savant syndrome has been used to describe ``a
spectacular skill or talent that occurs in an autistic or retarded
child.'' It might seem a likely subject for a disease-of-the-month
television movie. Instead, it is the theme of a motion picture,
``Rain Man,'' which is the most original and compelling American
drama since ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
   Yes, it's a drama, though, as in ``Cuckoo,'' there are hearty
laughs. Essentially it's the saga of two long-lost brothers seeking
a reconciliation against heavy odds.
   Cruise is a rapacious wheeler-dealer trying to make a bundle by
importing sports cars in Los Angeles. His major deal is interrupted
by news that his father, from whom he was long estranged, has died
in Cincinnati. Cruise attends the funeral and learns he has been
disinherited. His father's $3 million estate has been placed in
trust.
   But for whom? Cruise is astounded to learn that he has an older
brother, Hoffman, who has been institutionalized most of his life.
Cruise decides to virtually kidnap the brother and fight the will in
California.
   Hoffman may seem like an automaton, but he has a superhuman way
with numbers. This pays off at the blackjack table in Las Vegas.
That helps ameliorate Cruise's rage, and he begins to understand and
cope with his brother.
   No good to give away all the plot. Suffice to say that the
inspired script by Ronald Bass and Barry Morrow (based on Morrow's
story) offers a wealth of surprises, both comedic and dramatic.
   Barry Levinson (``Tin Men,'' ``Good Morning, Vietnam'') directs
in masterful style. It is his best effort in what promises to be a
distinguished career. He maintains a beautiful balance between the
hard-driving, cynical Cruise and the childlike Hoffman.
   Hoffman's performance is astounding. He gets inside the skin of
Raymond Babbitt and never allows him to become monotonous or
pitiable. Cruise, dashing in his ``Risky Business'' shades, carries
a heavy load, talking at a fast clip as the car dealer and as the
exasperated brother struggling to communicate with Raymond. Cruise
has emerged as a superb actor as well as teen-age heartthrob.
   Valerina Golino is excellent as Cruise's understanding
girlfriend. Jerry Molen injects humanity into his role as Raymond's
guardian.
   Mark Johnson produced the United Artists film which is rated R,
mostly for Cruise's expletives. Running time: 130 minutes.

   ``The Naked Gun''
   
   When was the last time you had some real fun at a movie? If you
have to stop and think, then run, don't walk, to the nearest theater
showing, ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad.''
   Be prepared for a zany, side-splitting collection of gags _ some
of them off color and most of them outrageous. And get ready to give
your laugh muscles a workout.
   ``Naked Gun'' is the latest product of those masters of hilarity,
David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker, who gave us the
memorable ``Airplane!'' and the not-so-memorable ``Top Secret!''
   This time they're parodying one of their own failures, the short
lived TV series, ``Police Squad!''
   Tried and true Leslie Nielsen is back as the unsmiling klutz of
the police world, Lt. Frank Drebin, who smashes police cars into
trash cans, gets his hand stuck in a fish tank and falls over his
own feet in the pursuit of justice. He's wonderful.
   Drebin, trying to foil a plot on the life of Queen Elizabeth II,
sets off a series of hilarious non-stop gags. For instance, he winds
up as the singer of the National Anthem and the umpire at a major
league baseball game where Reggie Jackson plays an unexpected role
as assassin-in-waiting.
   David Zucker's direction of these complex sight gags is flawless.
   Priscilla Presley is Drebin's romantic interest, Jane Spencer,
whose deadpan delivery is a match for Nielsen's. A scene in which
the two practice ``safe sex'' in body size condoms is typical of the
giggle power of this film.
   There is a villain, played by a silky Ricardo Montalban, a
bemused sidekick played by George Kennedy and lots of celebrity
cameos as well as a dumpy Queen Elizabeth look-alike.
   There are no messages here, and the story is just an excuse for
some terrific jokes. Call it slapstick. Call it crazy. Call it a hit.
   ``Naked Gun'' is rated PG-13 for language, double entendres and
implied nudity. The very young might wonder why the adults are
falling on the floor laughing.

   ``Funny Farm'' (Warner Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95; Rated PG)
   
   It takes courage for the makers of a comedy to put the word
``funny'' in the title. Sometimes it's an accurate assessment, as in
``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' that 1966 bawdy
farce starring Zero Mostel.
   Then again, it might be the kiss of death. And Warner Bros.
``Funny Farm'' definitely shows signs of rigor mortis. This Chevy
Chase comedy is about as funny as picking cotton on a 103-degree
August day. The laughs, such as they are, are forced and the
situations predictable. The video reeks of country bumpkin cliches,
and Chase, as usual, does a turn or two with Murphy's Law.
   What makes this movie an even greater travesty is that it's
directed by George Roy Hill, who made the very excellent ``Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' and the Academy Award-winning ``The
Sting.''
   The thin story line revolves around a writer and his wife who
decide to leave the noise, filth and crowds of city life for the
bucolic splendors of the country. There our hero hopes to write THE
GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. Instead, he becomes blocked out of his mind,
grows fat and lazy and idles while his wife turns a simple
experience with a squirrel into a best-selling children's book.
   In its theatrical release, ``Funny Farm,'' which co-stars Madolyn
Smith (``Urban Cowboy,'' ``All of Me''), stayed around for a blink.
   Perhaps some kind-hearted filmmaker will one day find some decent
material for Chase, whose acting talents and comedic genius have
been dashed in Hollywood. In the meantime, if you want to see this
basic plot work well, get the Kingston video, ``Mr. Blandings Builds
His Dream House.'' The 1948 black and white comedy stars Cary Grant,
Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas.

   ``Sunset'' (RCA-Columbia Pictures Home Video; VHS-Beta, $89.95;
Rated R)
   
   What if Wyatt Earp met Tom Mix, and the legendary heroes team up
to solve a murder and get the bad guys? In Blake Edwards'
``Sunset,'' the real-life cowboys do indeed get together for what
turns out to be a surprisingly delightful romp.
   James Garner and Bruce Willis star as Earp and Mix respectively.
It's an interesting pairing that produces just the right screen
chemistry. Garner is his usual homey good-guy with just the right
amount of laidback seasoning. Willis, usually brash and pseudo-hip,
plays Mix with a certain reserve and honesty.
   The time is Hollywood in the 1920s. Mix is the hottest action
actor around, and has been cast to portray the great lawman Wyatt
Earp. Earp has been hired to be a consultant on the film. Only
problem is, the movie is pure Hollywood hogwash and Earp's character
is made to look like a moron. The movie doesn't sit too well with
Mix, either. So the two heroes soon have a meeting of the minds.
   Meanwhile, back at the ranch so to speak, the studio boss' wife
is an old pal of Earp's and asks him to help her with a little
problem. This tiny problem turns out to involve murder and scandal
and is centered on her husband, a venal brute played viciously by
Malcolm McDowell.
   The dialogue from Edwards' slick screenplay (based on a story by
Rod Amateau) is fresh and funny, and the action and adventure lure
us to another time, the glittery golden age of Hollywood. And best
of all, it's all true _ give or take a lie or two.

   ``The Dead'' (Vestron Video; VHS-Beta, $89.98; Rated PG)
   
   While most of ``The Dead'' takes place at a Christmas party, this
is not a video to watch with a bunch of pals and a few beers. John
Huston's interpretation of James Joyce's short story is quiet,
powerful and elegant.
   It requires attention, and you will be rewarded. ``The Dead'' can
be funny and sweet, but its lasting impression is a profoundly sad
vision of the lack of connection between a husband and wife.
   The story unravels during a rather proper but entertaining party
given annually by two unmarried sisters and their niece in 1904
Dublin. Among the guests are young lovers, a drunk, a rebellious
nationalist woman and the couple, Gretta (Anjelica Huston) and
Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann).
   Anjelica Huston is a beautiful and surprisingly authentic Irish
woman, tormented by the memory a young man she loved as a teen-ager
and who she believes died for her.
   As those memories slowly are stirred by various events at the
party, Gabriel comes finally to realize ``how poor a part I've
played'' in her life. His preoccupation with a speech he gives at
the party suddenly seems so trivial, and his steadfastness so dreary.
   Nominated for an Academy Award for best screenplay, by Huston's
son, Tony, ``The Dead'' was finished just before John Huston died in
August 1987.
   ``The Dead'' is lovely to look at and truly moving.

   ``Verne Miller'' (Nelson Entertainment; VHS-Beta, $79.98; Rated R)
   
   ``Verne Miller'' is a tight, fast-paced, entertaining and
ostensibly accurate portrait of the Prohibition-era
lawman-turned-gangster who engineered the botched and bloody
``Kansas City Massacre'' trying to spring a pal.
   Scott Glenn has the title role of this unpretentious gangster
movie. He invests his character with a grace, nobility and charm the
real Verne Miller lacked.
   Filmed mostly on location in Alabama, it's full of nice period
costumes and architecture that frame some gorgeous performances,
including the brilliant Thomas G. Waites as Al Capone, Ed O'Ross as
brother Ralph Capone, Barbara Stock as speakeasy chanteuse Vi, and
Richard Bright as Adam Richetti.
   Writer-director Rod Hewitt took some chances with his abrupt
montage, but it works: Months pass between some scenes, minutes and
seconds between others. Yet each has its own compelling logic on the
journey Miller is making.
   On Nov. 29, 1933, Miller was found shot to death in a ditch
outside Detroit. Glenn's performance is so poised and intense that
he can give you the character while withholding his secrets.
Ultimately we don't know Verne Miller. But then, Glenn makes us wish
we could.
   This one's a real find.

   ``Die Walkuere'' (Deutsche Grammaphon) _ The Metropolitan Opera
Orchestra Conducted by James Levine.
   
   There's no shortage of recordings of Wagner's ``Die Walkuere'' in
the catalog, but the newest version, featuring the Metropolitan
Opera Orchestra conducted by James Levine, has been eagerly awaited
since the project was announced more than two years ago.
   For once, the results justify all the excitement. This Deutsche
Grammaphon release (available only on cassette and compact disc) has
got to be high on anybody's list of the best opera recordings of
1988.
   The cast closely follows the one heard currently at the Met in
its new production of Wagner's four-opera Ring Cycle. That means
it's about the best that could be put together from today's singers,
although not up to the superhuman standards set by Golden Agers such
as Flagstad or Melchior, or more recently by Birgit Nilsson.
   But it's hard to imagine a finer Sieglinde than Jessye Norman.
Her pillar of seamless sound and her impeccable diction are joined
by a passionate commitment that makes the final scene of Act 1
breathtaking. Gary Lakes, America's latest entry in the heldentenor
sweepstakes, is a more-than-respectable partner for her as Siegmund.
   Bass James Morris has the vocal weight and the beauty of tone to
make a world-class Wotan. An occasional blandness mars his
interpretation of this complex character, but he is still relatively
new to the part.
   As Bruennhilde, Hildegard Behrens sounds as good as she ever has,
which is splendid. The voice is thinner than ideal, but she never
sounds harsh or raw here as she sometimes does in performance, and
her understanding of the character is impressive.
   The lesser roles are cast impeccably. Christa Ludwig as Fricke
provides a link to the great tradition of early post-World War II
operatic singing, and Kurt Moll, the Hunding, is one of the finest
German basses in recent memory. Even the chorus of Valkyries is
unusually strong, including such major artists as Marita Napier,
Marilyn Mims and Linda Kelm.
   Levine and the orchestra do themselves proud. The sound is always
smooth and sonorous and the interpretation is quite moving at the
climactic moments, especially Wotan's eloquent farewell to the
disgraced Bruennhilde in Act 3.
   The orchestra, widely regarded as one of the world's finest
ensembles, had not recorded a home-grown production for 16 years,
since Bizet's ``Carmen'' with Leonard Bernstein conducting.
   This ``Walkuere'' certainly whets the appetite for the rest of
the Ring recordings and, one hopes, for more Met projects to follow.

   ``Imaginos'' (Columbia) _ Blue Oyster Cult
   
   Crash-and-burn guitars. Monster-movie lyrics. Sinister vocals.
Durn, it must be the Blue Oyster Cult!
   Yes, all the trademarks of the Cult are evident on ``Imaginos.''
But they seem hollow and sometimes downright silly amid the dense,
plodding heavy metal that characterizes most of BOC's latest effort.
   This band has sounded stagnant for about a decade now, coasting
on the devil-in-leather imagery that at one time produced some of
the most ferocious music on the rock 'n' roll landscape.
   Can anyone who experienced the multi-guitar rave-ups of BOC's
first five albums (or their mind-blowing live shows) fail to be
disappointed with the overdone bashing about on ``Imaginos?''
   The band has one of the genre's finest guitarists in Donald
``Buck Dharma'' Roeser, and the Blue Oyster Cult does know how to
rock. But the good moments here are just that _ a good guitar lick
here, an imaginative vocal turn there, buried in second-rate
material. You can sit and nod when the good bits emerge, if that's
your idea of a good time.
   Giving credit where it's due, ``Del Rio's Song'' soars above the
rest, distinguished by its crisp production, Eric Bloom's raw-edged
vocal and a strong, tuneful melody. There's also an interesting,
fancied-up remake of ``Astronomy,'' a song they first did in 1974.
   By most standards, this would be a decent hard rock LP. But the
Blue Oyster Cult has demonstrated many times they are more than a
decent hard rock band. That's what makes listening to ``Imaginos''
so infuriating.

   ``Paint Another Picture'' (Columbia) _ Darlene Love
   
   Darlene Love is one of the greatest rock 'n' roll singers ever to
grace our planet. Her work with Phil Spector in the 1960s _ ``He's a
Rebel,'' ``Da Doo Ron Ron'' _ recorded under a variety of names,
stands as the definition of the Spector sound. And ``Christmas
(Baby, Please Come Home)'' is simply the best rock 'n' roll
Christmas record ever.
   That's why her first solo album, even with help from Tom Petty,
Joan Jett, Paul Shaffer and master producer Jimmy Iovine, is a
disappointment.
   Love isn't the problem here. Thankfully, she's not one of those
time-ravaged legends croaking their way to another payday; after
more than two decades at it, she still sings stunningly well.
   The problem is the material, which is, simply, uninteresting. Too
often, Love is forced to fight her way out of syntho-pop musical
cliches, and that's a tremendous waste.
   Best is Petty's ``We Stand a Chance,'' which rocks a bit but
isn't exactly ``He's a Rebel.'' And the inclusion of a straight
cover of ``You'll Never Walk Alone'' _ yep, the same one Jerry Lewis
moans on Labor Day _ is simply puzzling.
   The record clocks in under 32 minutes, which, one assumes, is
testimony enough to the problem Love had in finding worthy songs for
this project.
   Since ``Paint Another Picture'' probably won't sell a zillion
copies, here's hoping Columbia gives her another chance. The notion
of Darlene Love making rock 'n' roll records again is exciting; it's
too bad this record isn't.

<HEAD>Star Watch: The Energetic Cronyn and Tandy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They are in their late 70s, yet Hume Cronyn
and Jessica Tandy manage to throw off more creative energy than a
crowd of Brat Packers.
   Some of that energy can be viewed in ``Cocoon: The Return,'' in
which they reprise their roles as a married couple facing the
husband's serious illness. In the first film, the rejuvenated Cronyn
dived, swam and ran. This time he was scheduled to join Don Ameche,
Wilford Brimley and Jack Gilford in a pickup basketball match with
four teen-agers.
   ``I had never played basketball in my life; at my school it was
not a big activity,'' said Cronyn. ``Dan Petrie, the director of
`Cocoon II,' said, `At least you've got to learn to dribble and pass
properly; I'm sending you a basketball.'
   ``The basketball arrived while I was teaching at the university
in Boca Raton, Fla. I tried to hide myself in the hotel parking lot
_ because to see an old boy of 77 bouncing a basketball all by
himself hour after hour....
   ``Of course when I got to the filming of it, they had doubles. I
hardly did anything but pass the ball to get rid of it. I felt quite
bitter about it.''
   Cronyn is no stranger to movie stunts. He reminisced about the
1947 ``Brute Force,'' in which he and Burt Lancaster staged a
climactic battle atop a burning prison tower.
   ``At the end of it, Burt picked me up and hurled me off the
flaming tower,'' the actor recalled. ``I dropped 20 feet onto a
platform. That is a long drop. I've done some diving in my time. Get
20 feet above the water and make a mistake, you don't forget it. If
you don't fall right onto a pile of mattresses, that's the last time
you'll do anything. I wouldn't dare do anything like that now.''
   ``Oh yes, you would,'' Miss Tandy corrected with a laugh. ``It's
the challenge that attracts him. And Hume keeps himself in good
shape. I don't worry about him.''
   The veteran stars, who are husband and wife, require a large
amount of vitality, especially when they are appearing in a
two-character play such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``The Gin
Game.''
   ``It's essential if you are performing that you keep your
energy,'' Miss Tandy said. ``You can't let go. You've got to keep in
good shape.
   ``We get old, and we can't do quite as much as we used to. But at
least you have to do the best you can.''
   The pursuit of excellence has marked both their careers. Hers
began in London, where she was born in 1909. At 16 she made her
stage debut, at 21 she was appearing in the New York theater. Cronyn
was also born in London, Ontario. He started acting in the Montreal
theater and moved to Broadway in 1934. Both of their careers
flourished after their 1942 marriage.
   How did they meet?
   Tandy: ``I was working in a play in New York. Hume was in the
audience, and he came backstage to see a friend of his who was also
in the play. He said, `How do you do?' and we went out to supper
with our mutual friend. Then we ...''
   Cronyn: ``Quarreled.''
   Tandy: ``We quarreled quite often, yes. It was not a sort of
`blinding light.'''
   Cronyn: ``My version was hilarious. I went back to see this
actor, Alex Knox, who was appearing in the play with Jessie. I had
seen her on the stage a couple of years previously in a play called
`The White Steed' and had admired her. ... We went out to supper
together, and I made what I thought was an amusing and caustic
remark about the nature of the English, which Jessie found
heavy-handed and stupid, which she let me know in no uncertain
terms.''
   Tandy: ``It wasn't that night at all. It was another occasion
entirely. (laughing) So there you are. It really doesn't matter.''
   During the early years of marriage, they pursued separate
careers. He appeared in such films as ``Shadow of a Doubt,'' ``The
Seventh Cross'' and ``Ziegfeld Follies,'' she in ``The Valley of
Decision,'' ``The Green Years'' and ``Forever Amber.''
   Her greatest fame came when she created the role of Blanche
DuBois in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Jack Warner chose her
co-star, Marlon Brando, for the film version but passed up Miss
Tandy for a movie name, Vivien Leigh.
   In recent times the Cronyns have appeared separately, but they
have earned a reputation as the latter-day Lunts, co-starring in 12
plays, including ``The Fourposter'' and ``A Delicate Balance,''
films such as ``Cocoon'' and ``batteries not included,'' and the
recent television film ``Foxfire,'' which he co-wrote and for which
she won an Emmy.
   Will they ever retire?
   Tandy: ``Oh yes. I hope that I shall be wise enough to stop
before everyone else knows I should stop. I think that I will do
less than I used to. But I do long for a challenge. I do want to do
another play, even though eight shows a week is hard work. However,
that's what I enjoy most.''
   Cronyn: ``I think Jess is a more dedicated actress than I am an
actor. It means a great deal in her life, and it means a lot in
mine. But there are other things I enjoy doing: I like trying to
write.
   ``I find it very difficult just to sit. I would love to learn how
to do that with contentment. I fill my life with a lot of `busyness'
in between jobs. Then I work very hard. Some of it is quite
unhealthy. It's compulsive. I don't know what to do about that. I'm
a little old to change.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Spun Sugar, Sculpted Chocolate And Visions of
Sugarplums</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visions of wonderful sugarplums have danced in
Albert Kumin's head, and his hands gambol through hot melted sugar
to turn those visions into glorious life.
   His tools are sugar and water, heat, a thermometer, dyes and a
marble slab on which to pour the sugar syrup, heated to 314 degrees.
Most of all, though, he uses his hands, which after 53 years at his
craft, are gnarled and scarred and stained.
   Kumin pulls sugar into ropes to weave a basket as delicate and
precious as porcelain. He blows sugar, just as glass is blown, to
create shimmering pieces of fruit to fill the bowl. And he molds
sugar for flower petals and leaves.
   One of his baskets is part of an astonishing exhibit of 200
culinary fantasies called ``The Confectioner's Art,'' now at the
American Craft Museum in New York. The show will travel to 10 cities
into 1991.
   Pulling sugar is hard work, requiring strength and speed. At a
touch he shapes the petals of a rose; a twist, and there's a leaf.
And in no time he has ``pretty much a rose like Mother Nature makes
'em.''
   Kumin, a former White House pastry chef who is tall and trim,
apparently is able to resist the temptation of his own creations.
However, no matter how lovely or ingenious, what he creates is
temporary, and his basket and some of the other pieces may not even
last through the tour of ``The Confectioners' Art.''
   ``In our trade, you understand, if it lasts forever, we would
lose our jobs. So you make another,'' said Kumin, now executive chef
at the International Pastry Arts Center in Elmsford, N.Y., during a
demonstration of his work at the museum.
   ``The Confectioner's Art'' is one rarely recognized, but
apparently popular, as people have lined up outside the museum to
see such works as a sugar recreation of a Spanish cathedral door,
stunning in its intricacy; what appears to be a tapestry of the
Statue of Liberty, actually made from jelly beans; a gorgeous blown
sugar vase, with a surprise cadre of sugar ants marching up one
side; a chocolate bowl that looks like swirled pottery; or an
extravagant chocolate New York City skyline carved into a giant Big
Apple.
   There are edible bracelets, a dazzling sugar White House and
Disney castle, glorious wedding cakes and a licorice mosaic. Some
pieces are witty and silly; some are literally too pretty to eat.
   The creators are equally diverse, some without formal training,
pastry chefs or artists who also work with more lasting materials,
even major manufacturers who introduced some whimsy in their
products.
   The exhibit also includes the history of sugar and chocolate;
tools of the trade; holiday sweets; and packaging and presentation.
   Meryle Evans, a food historian and curator of the exhibit, said
its popularity stems from the place sugar and chocolate hold in our
hearts _ and tummies.
   ``Sweet foods are associated with celebration, with rites of
passage, prosperity and collective joy,'' she said. ``Sweets and
their creators have, over many centuries, provided a mirror of
civilization, reflecting the customs and traditions of society.''
   In Renaissance Italy, the confectioner first flourished as an
artist.
   ``In that opulent, extravagant era, with its ferment of
expression in all the arts, the confectioner joined the sculptor,
wood carver and architect to produce all manner of elaborate
allegorical tableaux to grace the banquet tables of popes and
princes,'' Evans wrote in the catalog to the exhibit.
   Today, food arts have been revived.
   ``Food has become a much more important part of our lives again,
the whole idea of an artistic presentation,'' Evans said in a
telephone interview. She also noted that many pieces mirror more
traditional art, including Peter Boyle's pink and lilac blown sugar
vase, called ``Ode on a Grecian Urn.''
   ``People are coming in not expecting to see art; they're
surprised somehow at the results,'' said Boyle, who also blows
glass. ``But some of the pieces could be in any gallery if they were
in ceramic or a conventional medium.''
   But food holds special appeal.
   ``An artist, of course, hopes that his art can be consumed by the
mind and the eye, and if it's consumed by the stomach ... it's
another way to have it touch people,'' said Boyle, an artist from
Hoboken, N.J., who said his initial proposal for a sugar sculpture
of a full-size barbecue grill with hotdogs and hamburgers was turned
down as too lowbrow. But, he said, he couldn't resist the marching
ants.
   ``The Confectioner's Art,'' sponsored by Nestle Chocolate, is in
New York through Jan. 22, and travels to Atlanta, Philadelphia,
Blooomfield Hills, Mich., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, Salt Lake City
and Tampa, Fla.
   Evans said she hopes people will leave this exhibit ``with an
appreciation of the art of men and women dedicated to making our
lives a little pleasanter, as well as tastier.''
   But it's all look-but-don't-touch.
   ``For some reason, the mere fact that it's in a museum, seems to
be a deterrent,'' she said. ``Even none of the little kids have
tried'' to take a bite.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Richard Thompson Still Has a Sense of Purpose</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Thompson has been making records for over
20 years. His music, though, draws on sources much older.
   ``I hope that things like age aren't that important,'' said
Thompson, 39, a guitarist, singer and songwriter who helped form the
seminal English folk-rock group, Fairport Convention, in 1967.
``When I was 20, I was listening to people who were dead. You have
to listen to everything.''
   Fairport Convention seemed to work in the opposite direction of
rock music at the time. Instead of being influenced by the
psychedelic sounds of the Beatles on ``Sgt. Pepper,'' Fairport
Convention incorporated music from previous centuries. Rather than
use backward tape loops and distorted guitars, Fairport Convention
experimented with the fiddle and mandolin.
   Thompson, who left the group in 1971, recalled the sense of
purpose the members shared.
   ``We were concerned about reviving a traditional music in
Britain. I listened to a lot of Scottish music. That's a thing
that's important to me. We listened to traditional music and jazz
and rock 'n' roll.
   ``There was a great spirit of camaraderie and musical
exploration. I remember a feeling of kinship with the bandmates at
the time.''
   And hit singles were not important.
   ``I never even thought about it. It never crossed my mind that I
was going into the music business. I just found myself being a
professional musician.''
   His first solo album, ``Henry the Human Fly,'' came out in 1972,
and combined folk-rock music with Thompson's hard-edged singing.
   The same year, he married Linda Peters, a former backup singer,
and the two went on to record seven LPs together. In 1982, they
released ``Shoot Out the Lights,'' one of the most acclaimed records
of the year, but were divorced soon after.
   The popularity of the recording duo threatened to overshadow
Thompson's solo career as fans speculated whether his often bitter
love songs were about Peters.
   ``Songs are really work of the imagination,'' Thompson said. ``I
think it's putting too much of a limit to say this song's about this
person or that person. It should be bigger than that.''
   In ``I Still Dream,'' a ballad off his new album, ``Amnesia,''
Thompson sings: ``And I never was to know that I'd come to miss you
so. But time winds down and I turned my back long ago.'' He stressed
the song was not about his ex-wife.
   ``It's really a story song. It's not me. I'm telling a story
about a guy whose life seems aimless. It seems dull and dead. He's
compromised himself all the way.''
   Thompson took six weeks to make ``Amnesia,'' and for the first
time, recorded in the United States. ``Yankee, Go Home,'' another
song from the LP, might impress listeners as an attack against
American imperialisn, but Thompson doesn't see it that way.
   ``I see it as a friendly arm around the shoulder of America.
Saying how we in England used to have an empire and it got frittered
away. Finally, we've learned to adjust to this `tragic' fact. Now
it's your turn. It's time for America not to be Number 1.''
   On ``Jerusalem on the Jukebox,'' Thompson deals with a subject
familiar to most Americans: television evangelists.
   ```Jerusalem' is the name of a hymn sung in England. It's a great
song. I heard it played on a television show and was so alarmed that
things would reach this point.
   ``Is (evangelist) Jimmy Swaggert the tip of the iceberg? What
passes for spirituality?''
   Thompson says there is not yet an English equivalent to Jimmy
Swaggert, but there is the possibility: ``Britain is dying for
someone like Jimmy Swaggert. That sort of professional sincerity.
He'd be huge in Britain.''
   Many of Thompson's songs have sad overtones. He sings about
jealousy, lost love, death. But he noted that just because songs are
about sad events, they're not necessarily sad songs.
   ``It's sad, but cathartic. Expressing sadness isn't such a sad
business. It can make you feel quite good. I supposed I'm a really a
realist.''
   A realist, not a cynic. Rock was once considered a music for
young people, but many of its greatest performers are now
middle-aged and have struggled for a reason to continue.
   Not Thompson.
   ``Every once in a while, I step to one side and ask myself the
reason I'm playing music. Having re-established the direction, it's
easier to keep going,'' he said.
   ``If you see music as experiment and education, there is no end
to it. You're always looking for the next thing. If you're
commercially successful and you see that as the end, there's going
to be a real anti-climax.''
   And Thompson still believes in drawing on a wide array of music,
regardless of how many records he sells.
   ``Rock 'n' roll is now so multi-generational. You can fit almost
every musical style in existence into rock music these days. I'm on
the edge of it rather than the middle of it.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Ferlinghetti Recaptures Spirit of '68</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawrence Ferlinghetti, whose FBI file once
described him as ``a Beatnik Rabble Rouser,'' looked like an elder
statesman with his trim white beard, navy jacket and patterned tie
as he promoted his first novel in 28 years, ``Love in the Days of
Rage.''
   But the man whose City Lights press published and sustained a
generation of Beat poets is not another yippie gone yuppie. Look
closer and you see he's wearing an onyx stud in his right ear.
   Ferlinghetti is chiefly known as a lyrical poet whose 1958 work,
``A Coney Island of the Mind,'' is one of the best-selling books of
poetry in the past three decades, and as a political anarchist whose
publication of Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl'' led to his arrest on
obscenity charges.
   Although he has published some two dozen collections of poetry,
as well as essays and a handful of plays in his more than three
decades of writing, Ferlinghetti has written only one other novel.
``Her,'' published in 1960, is a surreal account of a young man's
search for his identity.
   ``Love in the Days of Rage'' (Dutton, $15.95) is set in Paris in
1968, during the student-led spring riots that shut down the
universities and paralyzed the city. The historical events serve as
the background for a love story between Annie, a painter who teaches
at the Beaux Arts, and Julian, a wealthy financier who calls himself
an anarchist banker.
   ``This new novel is much more accessible to the public; it's
written in a much more conventional style,'' said Ferlinghetti, 69,
sipping a beer in the lobby of the Algonquin hotel. As if to bear
out the Algonquin's reputation as a literary haunt, well-wishers
twice interrupted the interview to greet the poet.
   ``I really want to revivify the `spirt of '68,' as it was called
by the French. ... Especially today when we need it,'' said
Ferlinghetti, who finds this decade's emphasis on wealth and success
disheartening.
   ``In retrospect it was this `youthquake' against the
dehumanization of man, the new technocratic age.''
   Ferlinghetti said many of the anarchist arguments espoused by his
character Julian were lifted from Fernando Pessoa, a
French-Portuguese poet who wrote a novella early in the century
called ``The Anarchist Banker.''
   He was asked if Pessoa's philosophy of anarchism is his as well.
   ``Anarchism isn't really a philosphy and it isn't really an
ideal. It's an idea. The press has given anarchism a bad name.
They've equated it with terrorism. I'm talking about anarchism in
the traditional sense,'' he said. ``It's mostly civil libertarianism
and anti-fascism, really. ... The individual's freedom today is more
and more limited, not just by our government but the whole
industrial way of life. ... The point of view of the philosophical
anarchist is to stand up for the free individual.''
   He called Charlie Chaplin the archtypal anarchist, the little man
with the hat and cane fighting the big cruel world. The comparison
is not a flip one _ Ferlinghetti named his City Lights bookstore,
co-founded with friend Peter Martin, after the classic Chaplin film
about the tramp who falls in love with a blind woman. When the funky
little shop opened in San Francisco in 1953 it was the first
all-paperback bookstore in the United States and an instant hit. It
is still open until midnight seven days a week.
   A few years after the bookstore, Ferlinghetti launched City
Lights press, which published Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William S.
Burroughs and others who would come to typify the Beat Generation.
The press publishes about 12 to 15 titles a year, and Ferlinghetti
and co-editor Nancy Peters aim for a mix of poetry, foreign authors
_ ``what used to be called belles lettres'' _ and books on such
topics as AIDS or environmental causes.
   The bookstore and press support one another. Some years the store
makes money while the press operates at a loss, and vice versa. The
goal is always to break even. To make a profit means paying taxes,
says Ferlinghetti the anarchist.
   He challenged an interviewer's assertion that most of his writing
is overtly political. He said only ``about half'' was.
   Inside him is a ``lyrical individual, this eros, this
pleasure-seeking, love-seeking being intent on his own pursuits,''
he said. ``And every once in a while he turns aside from these
pursuits to give this political lout that's loping alongside a few
clouts. If you ignore him (the lout) he won't go away, he just grows
bigger and bigger.
   ``It'd be nice to just be writing love poems and be listening to
concertos all the time, but you have to fight the monster once in
awhile,'' said Ferlinghetti, blue eyes twinkling. ``I don't do it
anymore than I have to.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Country Music's Proving Ground</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHERA GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's a tiny nightclub sandwiched between
an office and recording studio, and a children's clothing store in
the chic Green Hills section of the country music capital.
   The Bluebird Cafe may be a few miles from the well-worn paths
tread by tourists, but it's a gathering place for recording industry
executives and those trying to get their attention. It's the place
where country music stars of tomorrow yearn to perform, waiting up
to four months for a precious spot on the tiny stage.
   It's country music's answer to The Comedy Store, the Improv and
Catch a Rising Star. It's country music's proving ground.
   Kathy Mattea got her break there. So did the Sweethearts of the
Rodeo, Steve Earle, T. Graham Brown and Foster and Lloyd.
   ``I started playing there about every three or four weeks, and
within three months of starting there I got a record deal,'' said
Mattea, whose ``18 Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' was voted single of
the year by the Country Music Association.
   When featured performers are presented Friday and Saturday
nights, it's standing room for those without reservations and a
tight fit for those who do have them. The intimate atmosphere is
integral to the music. Owner Amy Kurland said she has no plans to
move although the 6-year-old club seats only 130 or 150
sardine-style.
   ``It feels like a living room. Sometimes it's more intimidating
because you can see every face in the room,'' Mattea said.
   Songwriter Fred Knobloch agrees, but adds the closeness of the
audience is a barometer of how new songs and songwriters are being
received.
   ``The audiences are so close that they feel real involved in what
you're doing. If you're good, they love you; if you're bad, they are
polite and get up and leave,'' he said.
   About 90 percent of the crowd is involved in the music business
and the remainder are tourists and locals, or ``real people'' as
Kurland calls them.
   ``I desire that people be specifically interested in the music,
that listening to live music is enough and maybe having a glass of
wine _ not picking somebody up,'' Kurland said.
   ``The quality (of the performers) is always excellent. I maybe
book one or two people I'm disappointed with in a year.''
   Knobloch is often joined by fellow country-acoustic songwriters
Thom Schuyler, Craig Bickhardt and Don Schlitz to become SKBS, one
of the club's top draws.
   Schlitz wrote ``The Gambler'' for Kenny Rogers, Knobloch created
``Used to Be Blue'' for Sawyer Brown and Bickhardt wrote the Steve
Wariner-Nicolette Larson duet ``That's How You Know When Love's
Right.''
   Knobloch got his start at the Bluebird at a Sunday writer's night
_ a night set aside for songwriters to perform their new
compositions. Kurland is deluged with tapes from those who know that
playing a writer's night could mean a break.
   ``We make the music business accessible to the new guy,'' Kurland
said. ``But if it wasn't for the Bluebird and some other places to
play, you could never really function as a songwriter (in
Nashville). Appearing here is a crucial part of the process.''
   Budding songwriters know this and the walls of Kurland's
claustrophobic office prove it. Demonstration tapes fill racks on an
entire wall and others are scattered on her desk where a phone rings
repeatedly and a mammoth stuffed carnival prize snake curls watching
overhead.
   If the music satisfies Kurland's discriminating ear, there is a
four-month wait between an audition at the Bluebird until a writer
can perform on a Sunday night show. ``From the time they get here to
the time I would sign them as an act on a feature show, it will be
nine months to one year,'' she said.
   David Wilcox, a promising acoustic-folk artist, did his time on
the Bluebird circuit and Kurland has, for the first time, decided to
promote the undiscovered James Taylor-styled artist among her
contacts in the record world.
   Despite the time it takes to get on stage, many songwriters
hunger after a spot on the club's calendar.
   ``It is a songwriter's paradise,'' said Maggie Cavender,
executive director of the Nashville chapter of the Songwriters
Association International.
   ``The Bluebird plays a magnificent role (in the industry). ... It
is one of the greatest clubs in town. In my estimation, I think the
Bluebird is the ultimate in that sort of thing (displaying
songwriter's abilities).''

<HEAD>Horticultural Whodunnit: Who killed Wurzell's Wormwood?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE KATZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wurzell's Wormwood didn't count for much when it
was alive in the wild, but it's at the center of a controversy now
that it's gone.
   ``Something that's completely new to the world, in its only
locality, just wasn't looked after,'' lamented Brian Wurzell, the
plant's discoverer.
   Wurzell's Wormwood, Artemesia wurzellii, was the pride and joy of
the ecological consultant and botanist who in August 1987 discovered
it growing on a 2-square-yard plot in a park in north London. His
instincts told him it was something new, and tests at Leicester
University proved him right.
   He reported his discovery to the authority that runs the park,
``and I assumed from then on that the plant would be safeguarded,''
Wurzell said. On a recent visit to the site, ``I found to my horror
it had been dumped on. It was no longer there.''
   The loss is also mourned by Clive Stace, a botany professor at
Leicester University and president of the Botanical Society of the
British Isles.
   ``This was notified to the people in charge of this site,'' said
Stace. ``They agreed that it was interesting and they agreed to look
after it and not harm it, and then some twit dumped something on
it.''
   Artemisia wurzellii was a hybrid of two common species, one
native to Britain, the other Chinese. Such hybrids aren't rare; the
2,500 flowering plant species found in the British Isles have
spawned some 700 hybrid, he said.
   But Wurzell's discovery piqued botanists' interest because of its
unusual genesis _ its parents normally flower at different times of
the year. ``These two things must have flowered exceptionally,
either the one early or the other late, and overlapped so that one
could pollinate the other,'' Stace said.
   The result wasn't much to look at.
   ``It's a rather ugly, scruffy-looking green plant'' with small
brownish-greenish flowers, Stace said. ``It is not at all
attractive. Its interest is totally scientific as opposed to
aesthetic.''
   But Wurzell, like a proud parent, saw some beauty in the
botanical mongrel: ``It's not something you would grow in your
garden to look pretty. But it had a dignity of its own.''
   Leicester University botanists managed to cultivate a cutting
from a small piece of root Wurzell sent them shortly after
discovering the plant. But other than that, Artemisia wurzellii is
just a memory.
   ``It is extinct in the wild,'' Wurzell said. He wants to know who
to blame.
   ``I can't point an accusing finger,'' he said, ``but it looks as
though the contractors of a nearby road simply spread lots of soil
... having no idea that there was anything there that shouldn't have
been dumped on.''
   The Lea Valley Regional Park Authority promises to get to the
root of things. But an official, who insisted on anonymity,
cautioned, ``It might be nothing to do with road construction at all.
   Meanwhile, botanists can only wonder what might have been.
   ``If you destroy something, you don't know what you've lost,''
Stace said. Wurzell's wormwood might even have had commercial
potential, he said, noting that it comes from the strongly scented
Artemisia genus.
   But even if it was ugly and useless, it'll be missed.
   ``It's like a big jigsaw,'' Stace said. ``You might say you've
got a jigsaw of a thousand pieces, so it doesn't really matter if
you lose one, you've only lost one in a thousand. But it does spoil
the jigsaw, doesn't it?''

<HEAD>Uranium Atom Split 50 Years Ago This Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago this month, two German scientists
working with relatively simple equipment on unfinished pine tables
split the uranium atom, rocking the physics world and ushering in
the nuclear age.
   An unthinkable idea at the time, atom-splitting was later called
nuclear fission and used to produce nuclear power and the atomic
bomb.
   It brought Otto Hahn a 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry. A year
later, the bombing of Hiroshima turned his triumph to shock and
self-blame.
   ``I was shocked and depressed beyond measure,'' Hahn wrote in his
autobiography. ``The thought of the unspeakable misery of countless
innocent women and children was something that I could scarcely
bear.''
   Hahn, Austrian physicist Lise Meitner and chemist Fritz
Strassmann began their work after experiments by others who
bombarded uranium with neutrons. Neutrons, along with protons and
electrons, are building blocks of atoms.
   Starting in 1934 with research by physicist Enrico Fermi,
scientists were reporting varying answers about what elements were
produced as a result of that bombardment. Hahn and colleagues
decided to get to the bottom of that question.
   The historic experiment began the evening of Dec. 16, 1938, with
another bombardment of uranium. As Hahn and Strassmann worked to
identify the new atoms that resulted, ``we were faced by something
distinctly odd,'' Hahn said.
   To help in identifying the minute quantities of new atoms, the
scientists had been mixing in the element barium, which would grab
onto similar atoms. The barium latched onto some newly created
atoms, meaning they were either radium or barium. Barium was out of
the question, according to theory at the time. To produce barium,
the bombardment would have had to split the atoms.
   But further experiments left no doubt.
   On Dec. 21, Hahn and Strassmann finished a hastily written
manuscript that announced their results, but cautiously. ``As
chemists,'' Hahn said, ``we hesitated to announce a revolutionary
discovery in physics.''
   The theoretical explanation came from Meitner and her nephew,
physicist Otto Frisch, who realized the uranium atom had split like
a wobbling raindrop that finally breaks into two. They also realized
that the splitting released an enormous amount of energy. The energy
from just one ounce of uranium could supply the average American
household with electricity for 70 years.
   The news spread quickly. Frisch had barely begun telling Danish
physicist Niels Bohr on Jan. 3, 1939, when Bohr struck his forehead
and exclaimed, ``Oh, what fools we have been! We ought to have seen
that before!''

<HEAD>Teddy Bear Helps Regulate Premature Infants' Breathing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STORRS, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When month-old Vito Colucci snuggles up to
the baby-blue teddy bear in his incubator, he's getting more than
creature comfort.
   Vito, born 13 weeks premature, also is learning how to breathe.
   The hand-sewn, sheepskin bear in the isolette at the University
of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington has a balloon in its
abdomen connected to a mechanical air pump so the bear mimics the
deep, gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy, sleeping person.
   A research project under way at the university and St. Francis
Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford has shown that the bears can
help regulate breathing by inducing deep, quiet sleep in preemies,
who frequently suffer respiratory disorders, said Evelyn Thoman, the
behaviorist who designed the project.
   ``This is a stimulation that I call biologically relevant,''
Thoman said. She came up with the idea about 15 years ago and
experimented on rat pups deprived of their mothers. Those given a
surrogate mother _ a warm, moist, pulsating tube _ survived. Those
without a surrogate died.
   Premature infants were a natural subject for the study, since
they too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated in
an incubator.
   Her experiment is based partly on the physics principle of
entrainment, which holds that all pulsating or beating objects,
animate and inanimate, tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects.
The phenomenon explains why a half-dozen grandfather clocks on the
same wall eventually will synchronize.
   Thoman theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies, and that
aside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulate
brain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up to
the toys.

<HEAD>A Year of Decision: Bush Wins, Oprah Diets, Gorby Bites Big Apple</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhotos, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA LEVITT RYCKMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It was the year they held a presidential election and half the
nation's voters decided to stay home.
   It was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered,
barnacle-encrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the
world. It was the year an early decision to let Yellowstone burn
altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come.
   It was the year Oprah decided to diet, Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev decided he wanted to be president, Attorney General Edwin
Meese III decided to resign, evangelist Jimmy Swaggart decided to
confess his sins and Michael Spinks decided to challenge world
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson.
   Some decisions worked; others didn't.
   Soviets and Americans pulled together to free two surviving
whales, last seen cruising toward warmer waters. Soviet President
Andrei Gromyko bowed out, and Gorbachev took over. Oprah Winfrey,
the TV host, lost 67 pounds.
   In Yellowstone, however, officials realized too late they might
have made the wrong decision. By the time firefighters arrived,
unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of
control, forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among
area residents.
   Swaggart preached on but lost much of his audience after the
Assemblies of God decided to defrock him. Spinks lasted for just 91
seconds and eight decisive blows.
   The wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen.
   Faced with the choice between Vice President George Bush and
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, and frustrated by one of the
most low-down, dirty presidential campaigns ever, an ambivalent
electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to
overwhelming inertia.
   ``I've always loved election years,'' President Reagan said, but
it seemed hardly anyone else did. Bush's 54-46 percent victory over
his Democratic opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout, the
lowest in 64 years.
   Political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many
voters weren't voting for anyone so much as they were voting against
the other guy. They also determined that Bush lost 2 percent of his
supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision
_ to tap as his running mate Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle, the first
``baby boomer'' on a national ticket and a choice that surprised
even Bush's advisers.
   It was Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, the
silver-haired, smooth-talking senator from Texas, who provided the
only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates.
   ``Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy,'' Bentsen told a flustered
Quayle, after the 41-year-old senator had compared himself with the
late Democratic president.
   The Kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation. The 25th
anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on
idealism lost and a world changed.
   Nowhere was that change more apparent than in U.S.-Soviet
relations.
   Kennedy, on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago, shunned
Nikita Khrushchev when he visited New York. But Gorbachev, the first
Soviet leader since Khrushchev to taste the Big Apple, had a
super-power lunch with Reagan and Bush on Dec. 7 and addressed the
United Nations, with no Khrushchev-style shoe-thumping. Instead, he
promised to trim 500,000 men and 10,000 tanks from the Soviet armed
forces.
   The visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit Soviet
Armenia. The Soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated
60,000 had died and 500,000 were left homeless as whole cities
crumbled under the quake's force.
   Rescue teams, doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in
from around the world. It was the first time since World War II that
the Soviet Union had accepted disaster relief from the United States.
   Reagan paid his first visit to Moscow in June for a summit that
failed to break new ground in arms control. The president hammered
away on human rights issues, and Gorbachev later sent America living
proof of his commitment to change.
   Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov, father of the Soviet dissident
movement, was allowed his first trip outside the Soviet Union after
years of agitation over Soviet human rights policies.
   Americans vigorously agitated for their own causes. More than
5,000 people were arrested in anti-abortion protests that began in
July in 32 cities and continued through the year. Roe vs. Wade, the
Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, turned 15 years old,
intact.
   Anthony McLeod Kennedy, confirmed as a Supreme Court justice by a
unanimous Senate, inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but
gave no hint of his views.
   Court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the
once-powerful.
   Former Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife,
Imelda, were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they
plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded U.S. banks. Harry
and Leona Helmsley, the king and queen of New York real estate,
pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges.
   Republican Evan Mecham of Arizona became the first governor in a
half-century to be impeached and removed from office, although he
was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign
loan.
   Oliver North, John Poindexter, Richard Secord and Albert Hakim
pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling
arms to Iran and giving the proceeds to the Contras at a time when
U.S. aid to the Nicaraguan rebels was banned.
   Congress refused to restore military aid to the Contras but
decided to approve humanitarian aid after the Nicaraguan rebels and
the Sandinista government reached a temporary truce.
   Uneasy peace prevailed in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq War after a
United Nations-sponsored cease-fire began Aug. 20. Peace talks
opened five days later; they were deadlocked within 24 hours. In
Afghanistan, Soviet troops began a withdrawal in 1988, but the
guerrilla war raged on.

<TEXT>
   For one U.S. naval captain, the Persian Gulf became the site July
3 of a split-second decision with tragic consequences.
   As Capt. Will Rogers' guided-missile cruiser, the USS Vincennes,
exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats, Iran Air Flight 655 appeared
on the U.S. warship's high-tech radar. Mistaken reports said the
aircraft appeared to be descending and accelerating, as if
attacking; it failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military
channels.
   Rogers gave the order to fire. The decision, he later said, was
in defense of his ship and crew. But what Rogers feared was an
Iranian F-14 fighter actually was an Airbus A300 with 290 people
aboard, all of whom died.
   The Reagan administration defended the decision but also decided
to compensate the victims' families. Among the dead: a woman flying
with her eight children to meet her husband; an Iranian couple
flying to Dubai to shop for a daughter's wedding.
   Three days later, a North Sea oil and gas platform exploded,
killing 167 men in the world's worst-ever oilfield disaster and
creating another list of private tragedies. A bride of a few weeks
became a widow; a teen-ager who had worked offshore only a few days
died, as did a man who had volunteered to return to work a week
early.
   AIDS killed its 45,000th American victim. More than 7,000
researchers from 140 countries gathered in Sweden, where they
examined 3,200 reports on the fatal disease and agreed they had made
little progress toward treatment or cure.
   In the United States, a new AIDS case was being reported every 14
minutes, for a total of more than 30,000 in 1988. New York City
began a needle exchange program to try to curb the disease's spread
among needle-sharing drug addicts.
   Drug use overshadowed the Summer Olympics in Seoul, where
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson lost his gold medal, his 9.79 world
record in the 100-yard dash and millions in endorsements when tests
showed he had used muscle-building anabolic steroids.
   The Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, produced heroes who won
no medals. Speed skater Dan Jansen became the world's Heartbreak Kid
with his decision to compete _ and his subsequent fall _ hours after
his sister's death.
   As winter turned to spring, the fickle weather that had delayed
ski and sled events in Calgary became devastating drought across
America, baking the nation's farmland and turning the mighty
Mississippi into a muddy mess impassable for weeks. Crops and
profits shriveled in the fields as grain production dropped by
one-third, but the farmer got some help from Congress _ $3.9 billion
in drought relief.
   There was little relief on the other side of the world as floods
submerged three-fourths of Bangladesh, stranding at least 20 million
people who were forced to eat raw food and drink contaminated water.
As if the tiny country had not suffered enough, cyclones later
killed thousands.
   Hurricane Gilbert blasted across Jamaica, bounced off the Cayman
Islands and careened toward Texas, but the U.S. coast was spared in
the end. All told, the storm caused billions of dollars in damage,
mostly to Jamaica and Mexico, where more than 200 people died.
   In the skies, there were tragedies, triumphs and a couple of
miracles.
   A collision by three jets trying to create an aerial valentine at
an airshow in West Germany killed 70 people. An explosion of a
military plane killed Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and 28
others, changing that country's destiny. Benazir Bhutto became prime
minister, the office once held by her father, deposed and hanged by
Zia 11 years ago.
   The roof of a Hawaiian island-hopping Boeing 737 ripped away like
a can under an opener, but the plane landed safely, with only one
death. In a Delta crash at Dallas, 13 people died, but 95 survived
what early reports called a ``non-survivable'' accident.
   And millions held their breath as the space shuttle Discovery
readied for launch, the first since the Challenger disaster 32
months earlier. On the ground at Cape Canaveral, space veteran
Robert Crippen made the final decision to ``go.''
   A relieved nation cheered as the shuttle safely passed the point
where the Challenger had exploded.
   ``Each one of us knows where our place in the future is, where
Americans should be _ it's in space,'' Discovery astronaut David C.
Hilmers said. ``So let's ... make this adventure happen again and
again and again.''

<HEAD>Conventional Wisdom Shattered in Campaign with More Slime than
Substance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the 1988 political year began, the
conventional wisdom was that Ronald Reagan's retirement would mean a
close race for the White House, and George Bush, his
loyal-to-a-fault vice president, had little chance to succeed him.
   Now, at the end of a long campaign road strewn with the wreckage
of such assumptions, Bush is forming his administration and Democrat
Michael Dukakis is back at his old stand as governor of
Massachusetts.
   Democrats are taking comfort in their gains in other races.
Despite Bush's 40-state victory Nov. 8, the Democrats added to their
congressional majorities, picking up one Senate seat and three in
the House.
   With one more Democratic governor, the party now has 28, to 22
for the Republicans.
   But after losing their fifth presidential election out of the
last six, the Democrats were wondering when they would ever regain
control of the White House.
   For the voters, Election Day brought a welcome end to a campaign
that often was more slime than substance.
   Convicted rapist Willie Horton gained celebrity status and a dead
fish floating among the Boston Harbor debris became a familiar
television image.
   Dukakis was another ``liberal governor coming out of nowhere''
who had vetoed legislation to require the Pledge of Allegiance in
Massachusetts schools and who was a ``card-carrying member of the
ACLU.''
   Republicans were portrayed as ``popping champagne corks in their
penthouses.'' And their nominee? ``George Bush is a man who was born
on third base and thinks that he's hit a triple,'' was one of the
biggest applause lines at the Democratic National Convention.
   Was Bush a wimp? Was Dukakis too cold?
   Such matters overshadowed concerns about the budget and trade
deficits, education, drugs, and defense and foreign policy.
   The election year opened with high hopes for the Democrats. The
popular Reagan, after all, would not be on the ballot.
   The Democrats had regained control of the Senate in 1986, many
polls reported Americans wanted a change in political leadership
after seven years of a Republican White House, and everywhere Bush
went he was dogged by questions about his role in the Iran-Contra
affair. What did the vice president know and what advice had he
given the president?
   ``I've answered the questions and I've cooperated fully with any
investigations, none of which, by the way, were aimed at me,'' he
responded, refusing to discuss what he had told Reagan.
   Large fields were running hard in both parties at the start of
the election year _ eight Democrats and six Republicans.
   The Democratic contenders, along with Dukakis, were Sens. Joseph
Biden of Delaware, Paul Simon of Illinois and Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee; Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri; Jesse Jackson; former
Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado.
   On the Republican side, Bush was regarded as a shaky front-runner
with Senate GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Jack Kemp of New
York given strong chances of brushing the vice president out of the
race. The other contenders were former Secretary of State Alexander
M. Haig Jr., former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware and television
evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Bush was written off after finishing third to Dole and Robertson
in Iowa.
   ``The hemorrhaging of George Bush has begun,'' said Haig.
   But New Hampshire Republicans stopped that hemorrhaging and put
Bush back on track to the nomination.
   Displaying an uncanny consistency, Iowa voters also gave Dukakis
a third-place finish and he, too, won in New Hampshire.
   The two big winners in Super Tuesday's combination of primaries
were liberals Jackson and Dukakis. Gore did well in the Southern
primaries, but he had to split votes there with Jackson and had
little support north of the Mason-Dixon Line.
   On the Republican side, Bush swept all 16 primaries on the big
day.
   That effectively locked up the nomination for Bush. But Dukakis
still had a tough road ahead.
   He finished third in Illinois behind favorite sons Simon and
Jackson, and then was upset by Jackson in Michigan. But when the
race came down to Dukakis against Jackson, the Massachusetts
governor ran off a string of victories that clinched the nomination.
   The Democrats roasted Bush at their convention, put on a
closing-night unity show and saw their nominee jump to double-digit
leads in the national polls.
   Enter Willie Horton. In television commercials and countless
speeches, the Bush campaign raised the case of the Massachusetts
convict who, while free on a furlough from prison, raped a Maryland
woman.
   The Republicans also attacked the Democratic nominee for vetoing
the Pledge of Allegiance bill and for Boston Harbor's pollution.
   For weeks, Dukakis ignored the attacks. But his big lead in the
polls was dwindling and by Labor Day it was gone. By the time he
responded, it was too late. The big lead had swung to Bush.
   Bush built his lead despite what was widely regarded as a major
political mistake _ his selection of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as
his running mate.
   National polls consistently reported voters, by a wide margin,
preferred Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas over Quayle.
   But on Nov. 8 voters focused on the presidential nominees.
Despite Bentsen's presence on the ticket, Bush carried Texas.
   ``I think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have to
respond and you have to respond quickly,'' Dukakis said at a
post-election news conference.
   It was one of the kinder assessments of his effort, which many
other Democrats called ``the worst campaign of this century.''
   But the 1988 votes were no sooner counted than Democrats began
looking to 1992, when some old names _ Jackson, Gephardt and Gore _
may contend with some new _ Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Sam
Nunn of Georgia and the newly elected Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo _ for the Democratic nomination.

<HEAD>1988 Kindles Hopes for Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER C. PUTNAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guns fell silent on several battlefronts in 1988,
and hope emerged that mankind stood at the dawn of a more peaceful
age. It seemed as though the world had decided it had enough of war.
   Blood was still being shed in some parts of the globe. But Iran
opted for a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq, the Soviets
began to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, and Cuba, Angola and
South Africa chose to work towards peace in southwestern Africa.
   The year began with the ink barely dry on the first superpower
treaty to eliminate a class of nuclear weapons. Before the year was
out, many missiles were destroyed. U.N. truce troops won the Nobel
Peace Prize. President Reagan met not once, but twice, with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who announced unilateral reductions in
military strength.
   ``Forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or
another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace,'' Gorbachev said
in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly.
   Among other developments, Olympic athletes from both East and
West met in the Summer Games for the first time in 12 years in
Seoul. Fears of North Korean sabotage of the Games proved unfounded,
and the two Koreas took steps toward reconciliation.
   The United Nations also mediated peace talks on the Western
Sahara between Morocco, which occupies most of the northwest African
territory, and the Polisario independence movement.
   Southeast Asia's non-communist nations, Japan, and the
U.N.-recognized Cambodian government-in-exile worked toward getting
Vietnamese occupying forces to withdraw from Cambodia.
   Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders met to discuss the possibility
of reuniting the divided Mediterranean island.
   The PLO said it recognized Israel's right to exist, but the
United States and Israel said Yasser Arafat's statements still did
not go far enough. Meanwhile, Palestinians died at the rate of
almost one a day in their anti-Israeli uprising in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   And conflicts raged on in many other parts of the globe:
   _Burma struggled through political turmoil.
   _Central America simmered with continued fighting in El Salvador
and an uneasy truce in Nicaragua.
   _Moslem guerrillas continued their fight in Afghanistan against
the Soviet-allied government.
   _The Sikhs still struggled for an independent homeland in India,
as did the Tamils in Sri Lanka, and other rebel groups in the Sudan
and Ethiopia.
   _Five thousand died in ethnic violence in Burundi.
   _Dozens died and thousands were forced to leave their homes
because of domestic unrest in Armenia and Azerbaijan in the southern
Soviet Union.
   _And in Lebanon, the streets of Beirut remained a battleground.
The nation came closer than ever to formal partitioning into
Christian and Moslem sectors, and Israeli raiders struck repeatedly
against the south in retaliation for anti-Israel guerrilla activity.
   Still, the year wound to a close with a sense of hope.
   ``There is a new mood of understanding and common sense,'' U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in accepting the
peace prize Dec. 10.
   ``We can, and must, achieve what we have dreamed of for so long,
that is to make the rule of law the standard rather than the
exception in world affairs.''

<HEAD>Crippen's `Go' Puts Americans Back in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With tension high, the countdown
clock for the launch of space shuttle Discovery ticked down to nine
minutes, and then was stopped, deliberately, to be held there for 10
minutes while one man made the critical decision on whether to
proceed toward liftoff.
   This was no ordinary countdown. It was to be America's first
shuttle flight since the Challenger explosion killed seven crew
members 32 monthsture of the U.S. space program was
at stake.
   Memories of that tragedy were earlier. The fu on everyone's mind as
five
astronauts boarded Discovery on the morning of Sept. 29.
   One of the astronauts' own, Navy Capt. Robert Crippen, a veteran
of four shuttle missions, had the awesome responsibility to make the
decision that would send them on their way, or keep them on the
ground for another day.
   Crippen's assignment was a product of Challenger. No one man held
sole authority to say ``go'' or ``no-go'' on any of the previous 26
shuttle launches.
   NASA decided it needed such a launch czar to avoid the
communications failures that prevented the concerns of lower-level
engineers about cold weather from reaching those making the decision
to launch Challenger. The frigid temperature was cited by
inve.
   Two months later, the count reached nine minutes on the second
post-Challenger mission. Again, high altitude winds were a problem.
This time they were too strong, but they moderated gradually
throughout the morning.
   Crippen looked at the latest data and made his decision,
dispatching Atlantis and five astronauts on a secret Defense
Department mission during which they reportedly released a
sophisticated reconnaissance satellite. It was another successful
flight on NASA's comeback trail.
   The successes set the stage for a stepped-up shuttle launch
schedule in 1989. Seven flights are planned, including three
scientifically prized missions that will deploy the Hubble Space
Telescope and dispatch payloads to Venus and Jupiter.

<HEAD>Indecision Leaves Billion-Dollar Headache for Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For sale: Dozens and dozens of insolvent savings
and loan institutions bleeding red ink to the tune of millions of
dollars. Ultimate cost to clean up the industry: between $50 billion
and $100 billion.
   Contact the Bush administration, the new landlords.
   If 1988 was a year of decision for the American electorate, for a
Navy captain in the Persian Gulf, for millions of amnesty-seeking
aliens and for countless others, then it was also a year of
indecision for those charged with resolving the multibillion-dollar
savings and loan crisis.
   A result of economic recession here in the Southwest, high-flying
antics of speculators and developers, and widespread fraud in the
early 1980s, the S&L problem has grown over the past few years from
a million-dollar headache to a billion-dollar migraine that may
hinder budget and no-new-taxes planning by the Bush administration.
   ``The thrift industry's problems alone now demand funding on a
massive scale,'' said William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. and one of the nation's top banking
regulators. ``That funding requirement appears to exceed the
combined resources devoted to Europe under the Marshall Plan, and
the bailouts of Lockheed, Chrysler, Penn Central and New York City.''
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates S&Ls, launched
a much-heralded ``Southwest Plan'' in 1988 to begin folding the
losers into money-making thrifts.
   But analysts have criticized the slow pace of the plan, and the
cost. Fifty-four grossly insolvent S&Ls were sold, but at least 164
remained unresolved.
   ``It's full-steam ahead, and we're going as fast as we can get
the cases done,'' said Carl Hoyle, FHLBB spokesman.
   Federal prosecutors launched one of the biggest
white-collar-crime task forces in history, taking over almost an
entire floor of an FBI building in Dallas. But the pace of major
indictments has been slow, and the statute of limitations on bank
fraud (five years) was hanging over the effort.
   And despite the dire economic predictions and an ``indecision
meter'' adding $1 billion a month to the cost of resolving the S&L
problem, Congress opted to continue to study the problem, rather
than raise taxes to close out the cases.
   ``We were calculating the cost of closure at $20 billion three
years ago,'' said industry analyst Warren Heller of Veribanc, Inc.
``They didn't have the $20 billion back then either.''

   The United States, historically a nation of youthful orientation,
is now thirty-something and heading upward, reports the Census
Bureau.
   If present trends continue, census officials expect that half of
all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010, and half
younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was 32.1,
as of last July 1, the highest ever.
   The 35-44 age group is the fastest-growing segment of the U.S.
population, and the population segments aged 85 and over and 75-84
rank second and third in growth since 1980, the Bureau said.
   Combining to increase the median age of the population are the
maturing of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and that
generation's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number of
babies to pull down the numbers.
   The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in
1950, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop of
youngsters to lower the numbers.
   It took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7
as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990, 36.5 by 2000 and
39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from the
Census Bureau.
   Despite the aging of the population, however, the report
anticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline.
   That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared
to the number of people of working age in between. The younger and
older groups are most likely to ``depend'' on those working.
   The 1986 ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected to
slip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing the
number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to
the older group.
   While there have been reports of increases in the total number of
births in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boom
generation is largely in its prime child-bearing years. The rate of
births per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War II
period.
   ``The repercussions of the Baby Boom are many and varied,''
Census Bureau statistician Louisa Miller said. ``They will continue
to affect the United States for many years to come.''
   They are now at the age where they have more discretionary income
and the effect can be seen in the nation's culture and marketing,
she said.
   The generation's arrival spurred a boom in sales of baby
products. It then proceeded to overwhelm the school system,
following up with creation of a national orientation toward teen-age
music and styles.
   Now, as the Baby Boomers set up more and smaller households, they
are prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods, marketing
experts say.
   ``Further down the road, once they begin to reach retirement age,
they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the country
takes,'' Miller added.
   The census projections show the Northeast remaining the oldest
section of the country, with the median age for that region
increasing from 33.6 in 1986 to 40.3 in 2010.
   The South will be second in 2010 at a median age of 38.4, up from
31.4 in 1986. The Midwest will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the West
will go from 31.0 to 37.4.
   Florida will remain the state with the highest median age and
Utah will still be the youngest state, according to the projections.
   Florida, with a median age of 36.0 in 1986, will age to 45.3.
Utah's median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only state
with a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuing
high birth rate.
   In the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but several
were under 30, including _ besides Utah _ Alaska, Idaho, Louisiana,
Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.
   In 2010 not only Florida will have topped 40. Other states with
median ages above that milestone will include Arkansas, Connecticut,
Iowa, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop says old people
don't have to suffer poor health just because they're old.
   ``The whole theme of this meeting is it's never too late to start
prevention,'' Koop said at a workshop on health promotion and aging.
   ``Old age is not a disease and there are many oldsters who are
disease free,'' said the 71-year-old Koop. ``You don't necessarily
have to have your kidneys fail, you don't necessarily have to have
dementia. ... My plea would be to separate old age and disease. They
don't necessarily go together.''
   Even though the U.S. population is aging, he said, it is not
becoming less healthy.
   ``As we see people who are now in middle-age come along into the
graying years they are going to be far healthier than this
generation was when it entered the 65-and-older group,'' he said.
   ``These are the people who are jogging and swimming and hiking.
These are the people who are snacking on salad and yogurt. These are
the people who are wearing sensible shoes. They have stopped
smoking. They have given up hard liquor. They wear seat belts. They
understand the things they can do to preserve the quality of life
and the function they already have.''

   The returns are spectacular for Lions Club
members, average age 82, who give their time to collect old
newspapers for recycling in this retirement community.
   Their efforts allow local charities to save an estimated $80,000
each year in rent, send dozens of handicapped kids to a special camp
at no cost to their families, and provide drug education in nearby
elementary schools.
   The Host Lions, and nine other Lions Clubs in the Sun City area,
earn about $200,000 annually by collecting, bundling, transporting
and selling the old newspapers that residents would otherwise throw
in the trash.
   The newspapers pile up at the rate of 35 tons a day in the winter
time, dropping to about 18 tons a day in the summer, when many of
the retirement community residents leave their suburban Phoenix
homes for cooler climes.
   In 1987, the 10 Lions Clubs collected $335,000 from the sale of
the old newspapers, and after paying $132,000 for loading, shipping,
string to tie the bundles and leases for their collection sites,
earned a net profit from the newspaper recycling of just over
$200,000.
   It may not be as profitable this year. In November 1987, old
newsprint was selling for $54.70 per ton. This year, because of
increased competition from city governments who have turned to
recycling, and a cutback in export sales of recyclable paper, the
market price is down to $28.40 per ton.
   Sam Higginbotham, 79, who retired about 30 years ago, started the
project 20 years ago when Host was the only Lions Club here. As more
clubs were formed, Higginbotham involved them in the project.
   Gene Gravlin, 72, is running the project now, with help from
George Oldham, 69.
   Higginbotham was one of the first residents of the retirement
community started by Del Webb, buying in before the first house was
completed.
   ``The good Lord's been good to me, and this is a way I can give
something back,'' Higginbotham says. ``It's only fair to do that.''
   Gravlin, who ran the marketing division of a major shoe
manufacturer before retiring, says its a good way to keep active. He
says the retirees have been through the pressure years of earning a
living, and now that they have time available, they can turn their
attention to helping others.
   ``Helping others is a moral obligation that every human being
has,'' he says. ``Some accept it and some don't.''
   Oldham, who ran a department store in Kansas before he retired,
and a men's shop in Colorado after his retirement, is getting set to
take over the operation.
   ``We return something to the community,'' he says. ``That gives
us a good feeling. We're not just sitting around.''
   Higginbotham was involved in construction, railroading, real
estate and the hotel-motel industry before moving to Sun City.
   ``We built three buildings with the money we got for the
newspapers,'' he says. Del Webb Co. donated the land, but the Lions
paid the $330,000 cost of construction.
   ``We've got a dozen charities that we've given the space to, for
$1 a year,'' he says. ``A financial consultant told us three months
ago that, judging by what office space is renting for, we're saving
the charities about $80,000 a year in rent. That's $80,000 more they
can use to help others.''
   Money from the newspaper recycling is added to funds collected by
other Lions Clubs in Arizona to support their special mountain camp
for handicapped children.
   ``There is one counselor for every two handicapped camper,''
Gravlin says. ``It's a great experience for them.''
   Newspaper recycling profits are also invested in El Mirage
Schools, for an anti-drug program that Gravlin says is credited by
school officials with reducing the dropout rate in the distrct.

   If you're under 50, skip this story.
   If you read it, you may wish you were older.
   Joan Rattner Heilman _ who is over 50 _ has compiled a book of
bargains for those born at least half a century ago, with
information varying from hotel, motel and restaurant discounts to
over-50 bike tours and ski clubs.
   Titled ``Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50'' (Contemporary Books),
the paperback also deals with travel and tour tips, breaks on
airfare and car rentals, perks in parks, even going back to school.
   The idea for the book started with Ms. Heilman's national
magazine article, which got a response indicating ``everybody is
interested'' in the subject, she says. With about one-quarter of the
nation's population in the over-50 category, ``everybody is jumping
on the bandwagon and there are new things all the time,'' says Ms.
Heilman.
   She has updated the original 1988 book with some new ``deals''
for a 1989 edition.
   ``On your 50th birthday,'' Ms. Heilman writes, ``you qualify for
hundreds of special opportunities and money-saving offers that will
have lots of people wishing they were older. All for a couple of
good reasons.
   ``First, you deserve them, having successfully negotiated your
way through life's white waters.
   ``And second, as the fastest-growing segment of the American
population, you represent an enormous market of potential consumers,
a fact that has become quite apparent to the business community.''
   Her biggest piece of advice: ``Make a practice of asking if there
are breaks to which you are entitled wherever you go, from movies to
museums, concerts to historic sites, hotels to ski resorts,
restaurants to riverboats, in this country and abroad. Don't expect
clerks or ticket agents to volunteer them to you.''
   She adds: ``Remember to request your privileges before you pay or
when you order or make reservations, and always carry proof of age
or an over-50-club membership card, or, better yet, both.''

   Millions of mature Americans are spending their time,
independence and money on traveling in recreation vehicles, reports
a national association for the retired.
   The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) estimates that
nine million senior Americans use recreation vehicles each year.
   ``Mature travelers are good candidates for RV travel,'' says Ron
Noe, member services specialist for AARP, ``because many have the
time, discretionary funds and desire to see and experience the small
towns, big cities, popular attractions and natural beauty of the
United States.
   ``RVs provide them with an enjoyable, comfortable and economical
way to take it all in and enjoy the social benefits of camaraderie
on the road.''
   A University of Michigan survey of the recreation vehicle
consumer reported that nearly 10 percent of heads of households over
50 who own vehicles own 30 percent of the RVs in use.
   AARP reports that RV trips account for 18 percent of all trips
taken by those in the 55-59 age group. Seventy-two percent of all RV
trips are made by travelers 50 years and older, AARP says.
   Recreation vehicles include motor homes, travel trailers, truck
campers, folding camping trailers and van conversions.

   Older drivers pose a greater risk of being
involved in accidents but driving should not be restricted solely on
the basis of age, says a recent government study.
   The study by the National Research Council says roadway signs and
markings should be redesigned to better meet the needs of older
drivers, and that screening should be improved to identify impaired
drivers of all ages.
   The report urges states to tighten their screening programs and
issue restricted licenses in some cases such as limiting certain
applicants to daytime driving only.
   It criticized a movement in some states to allow drivers licenses
to be renewed by mail without drivers being required to undergo
vision tests at least every four years.
   But the study concluded that ``age alone is a poor predictor of
the (driving) performance of any individual,'' although
acknowledging after age 75 a driver is ``about twice as likely (per
mile driven) to be involved in a crash'' as middle-aged drivers.
   The National Research Council panel, composed of experts
assembled by the National Academy of Sciences, spent two years
examining questions about transportation and the elderly.
   It said problems of meeting the transportation needs of older
citizens will increase in the years ahead as the numer of people
over 75 increases and more elderly people live in the suburbs where
less public transportation is available.
   ``The states are not prepared to handle the growing number of
very old drivers or to identify those at high risk of accident
involvement,'' the study concluded.
   ``Most older persons will probably be quite capable and safe
drivers. But current statistics indicate that drivers 75 and over
are more at risk of crash involvement than the average driver. ...
Thes facts must be acknowledged even though there is no
justification for restricting driving on the basis of age alone.''
   Furthermore, the panel said, elderly people are more likely to
suffer serious or fatal injuries than other drivers in accidents of
similar severity.
   The study said elderly people, especially those 75 years or
older, often have problems reading traffic signs, seeing clearly at
night, gauging traffic flow when merging into traffic or making left
turns, and turning their heads when backing their vehicles.
   But ``when examined in terms of incidents, the problem that older
persons represent to overall traffic safety is small relative to
that of the (teen-age) driver,'' the committee wrote.
   The panel encouraged older drivers to buy automobiles equipped
with air bags, the devices that inflate automatically to protect the
head and upper torso in a crash.
   The committee also urged the use of seat belts, but suggested
manufacturers could make them more comfortable and easier to use. It
also suggested that roadway markings and signs be made larger or
brighter. It said the current road sign standard currently exceeds
the visual ability of about 40 percent of drivers who are 65 years
or older.
   Even with various design improvements in the coming years, an
increasing number of older people will require public transportation.
   Communities should improve public transit for the elderly,
develop subsidized taxi programs and construct walkways in suburban
areas if the transportation requirements of the elderly are to be
met, the study said.

   Older adults generally do not have to give up driving because of
aging changes in vision _ but they should recognize their
limitations, advises the American Optometric Association.
   More than 37 million Americans over 55 years old drive, and
according to the National Safety Council they have a poorer accident
record than drivers in their middle years.
   Failure to yield right-of-way, improper lane changes, passing and
turning are among the most common traffic violations committed by
older drivers, national studies have shown.
   According to the optometrists, changes in vision may interfere
with older drivers' abilities to see and recognize what is on the
road ahead, to see effectively at night, to see against the glare of
oncoming headlights and to recover quickly from glare.
   Other factors include faulty judging of distances between
themselves and other vehicles or objects, and the detection of
movement from the side while looking straight ahead.
   Suggestions from the optometrists on how older drivers can
compensate for vision changes include:
   _ Avoid driving at dusk.
   _ When driving at night, reduce speed, try to limit driving to
well-lighted or familiar roads, and keep headlights, taillights and
turn signals clean and properly adjusted.
   _ Take time to adjust to a new eyeglass or contact lens
prescription before driving.
   _ Avoid frames with wide side pieces that may block side vision.
   _ Wear quality sunglasses on sunny or bright, cloudy days, but
never wear sunglasses, or fashion-tinted lenses, when driving at
night.
   _ Confine driving to places, speeds and hours in which they are
comfortable and competent.
   _ Avoid pulling off alongside the highway. If necessary, use the
car's four-way emergency flashers.
   _ Keep windshield and rear windows clean, inside and out, and
replace worn wiper blades promptly.
   _ Keep rear view and outside mirrors clean and properly adjusted.
Be aware of their limitations.

   Elderly Americans living alone were more likely
to still be alive two years later than those who made their home
with someone other than a spouse, a government researcher has
reported.
   More than three-quarters of them also were still living
independently after two years, said Dr. Mary Grace Kovar of the
National Center for Health Statistics.
   Her findings are based on interviews in 1984 and 1986 with people
who had been aged 70 and over in 1984.
   ``The most important thing is the stability. Most of these
people, two years later, are still living in the community. Those
who were living alone are still alone, and those with someone else
are still with someone else,'' Kovar said in a telephone interview.
   ``As you would expect, because these people are 72 or older,
death rates are high. But relatively few of them are in nursing
homes,'' she said.
   Of nearly 6.4 million elderly Americans living alone in 1984,
89.8 percent were still alive two years later, the study found.
   By comparison, 87.3 percent of those living with others survived
two years. Those living with a spouse did nearly as well as those
alone, 89.0 percent surviving. But, of those living with someone
else _ friends or family _ only 84.3 percent were still alive.
   People living with brothers and sisters tended to live longer,
but that may have been because longevity ran in the family, Kovar
speculated.
   Of those who had been on their own in 1984, 77.8 percent were
still living by themselves in 1986, she found. About 7.4 percent of
them had moved in with someone else _ most often family _ and 4.6
percent were in an institution.
   ``It certainly appears that for some of them life is better'' two
years later, Kovar said. ``Some have remarried ... and when we asked
those who had moved why ... we got'' answers ranging from health to
being nearer to children to spending the summer in Maine and winter
in Florida. One, she commented, even cited lower golf fees for
moving.
   A major factor in continued independence is likely that those
living alone were more healthy at the start of the study, she
concluded in the report, ``Aging in the Eighties, People Living
Alone _ Two Years Later.''

   More than 40 percent of nursing homes failed to
meet sanitary standards for food and nearly 30 percent failed to
meet standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness,
according to the federal government's first consumer guide to
nursing homes.
   The survey also found that more than one-fourth of the nursing
homes do not administer drugs properly.
   However, Dr. William L. Roper, chief of the Health Care Financing
Administration that compiled and released the statistics, cautioned
against reading more into the figures than is warranted.
   ``This is not the ultimate report card for nursing homes around
the country,'' Roper told reporters.
   He said the ``met-unmet'' criteria for each of the 32 categories
included in the state-by-state reports contains no measure of
severity and represented a one-time ``snapshot'' of conditions at
the nursing home's most recent unannounced inspection. To some
degree, he said, it relied on the subjective judgment of the
inspector.
   At the same time, Roper defended release of the report against
industry criticism that it would mislead consumers.
   One complaint was, for example, that a nursing home might be
given an ``unmet'' mark on proper administration of medication if
one patient was five minutes late getting his or her medicine.
   ``If one person was five minutes late, I'm sure they would not
have been dinged in the survey,'' Roper said. ``What we're looking
at, what the surveyors look at is the pattern of care over time.
   ``We are not in the business of making arbitrary, bureaucratic
judgments. We are trying to evaluate what is really happening to
people in that nursing home.''
   He added:
   ``What we are looking for ... is not nursing home providers that
barely scrape by. We're looking for people who are good providers,
consistently, over time, 365 days a year. And I have to believe that
if that's where a nursing home operator has his or her nursing home,
they are not going to be worried about being dinged on some trivial
point.''
   The 75-volume guide shows how each of the 15,000 nursing homes
fared on 32 health, safety and care standards based on periodic
inspections by state agencies. About 2,400 of the 15,000 received
passing marks in all 32 categories.
   According to the survey, nearly 43 percent of the homes failed to
meet sanitary standards for food. Almost 30 percent failed to meet
standards for maintaining residents' personal cleanliness and 29
percent failed to administer drugs according to doctors' orders.
   However, the report also said that only a small percentage of the
nursing homes failed to meet standards in many other categories.
Overall among skilled homes, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in
only 10 categories.
   Paul Willging, executive vice president of the American Health
Care Association, which represents more than 9,000 nursing homes,
said the report ``is misleading _ it is going to confuse the
public'' by making it appear conditions are worse than they are. He
said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead
to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard.
   But Elma Holder, executive director of the National Citizens'
Coalition on Nursing Home Reform, said: ``We think the national
statistics are misleading. Conditions are worse.''

   The focus on Alzheimer's disease generally is on the patients,
not their families.
   But a new program uses coloring books, a mascot dog and movies to
show elementary school pupils how the debilitating ailment can be
battled. For a few hours, the students put aside their reading,
writing and arithmetic to look at a disease that may not afflict
them for 60 years, if at all.
   The purpose of the effort is not so much to understand how the
disease works but to show how the loved ones of an Alzheimer's
sufferer can, with patience, helpful advice and love, minimize the
worst of the disease's effects.
   Alzheimer's, characterized by memory loss and other dementia,
afflicts an estimated 5 million mostly elderly Americans.
   The southern Massachusetts town of Westport, which is in the
third year of a federal Health and Human Services grant intended to
promote community programs, developed the daylong seminar on
Alzheimer's after meetings between school officials and William
Connolly of New Jersey-based Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., who
spends summers there. Sandoz manufactures Hydergine, a drug that can
ease some symptoms of Alzheimer's in milder cases.
   Westport changed the emphasis because of mounting evidence that
children are often acutely aware of and confused by the decline of a
loved one.
   A coloring book titled ``Helping Grandma,'' by Westport High
School art teacher Betsey MacDonald, told the story of a grandmother
who gradually begins to show signs of memory loss.
   ``Children are often kept in the dark about aging,'' said
MacDonald. ``They automatically think that `old' means `sick.' But
children are wonderfully resilient and surprisingly insightful when
spoken to directly on the subject.''
   The point of the coloring book, geared toward elementary school
children, is to ``teach them understanding and to teach them that
what she needs is support.''
   Also, mature, well-behaved dogs from an animal shelter can
provide some stability and love for an Alzheimer's sufferer,
Connolly said. Jeff, a black and white mongrel from a Rhode Island
animal shelter, has become the national poster dog for the so-called
human-animal bonding campaign, and he travels with Connolly to
events on the subject.
   The Alzheimer's event was tried out earlier this year in
Bloomington, Ind.

   Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by
regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but
calcium supplements taken after menopause probably won't be
effective, researchers say.
   In a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
researchers said the key factors in bone density among
post-menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally
occurring hormone estrone.
   Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do
not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating
disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner
and more brittle, they found.
   ``Swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not
going to make your bones thicker,'' said Dr. Lewis Kuller, of the
Epidemiology Department at the University of Pittsburgh's School of
Public Health.
   Kuller, a co-author of the study involving 174 healthy
post-menopausal women over a four-year period, also said, ``There is
no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their
bone density.''
   ``The most important message ... is that an adequate calcium
intake during childhood, adolescence, post-adolescence and the
reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health
and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis,'' he
said.
   Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to
bone fractures and spinal problems like dowager's hump. Some
estimates project that by age 70, one-quarter of the women in North
America will have suffered a fracture related to the disease.

   Use the rubber end of a pencil or pen to push the buttons of a
telephone or turn the pages of a book.
   Use an electric stapler to help reduce fatigue in hands, wrists
and shoulders.
   If you aren't up to typing, use a dictating machine.
   These are among suggestions for office workers who suffer from
arthritis to help ease their work. The advice comes from Frances
Mason, who has had rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis for nearly 20
years and is now a volunteer counselor for the New York chapter of
the Arthritis Foundation.
   ``Until recently,'' she said in a recent issue of AIMplus, an
arthritis information magazine, ``people with arthritis found it
very difficult to keep on working _ not because they didn't want to,
but because the attitude of society in generally has been that a
disabled person `just couldn't do the job.'''
   While attitudes have changed, she said, and many disabled persons
are finding less difficulty in finding and keeping a job, ``some
people with arthritis may find that their condition does somewhat
limit their abilities to accomplish as much as they would like.''
   She offers some other suggestions to ease that problem:
   _ Conserve energy by planning ahead; schedule the more demanding
tasks for times of day when you are feeling your best.
   _ Make sure your chair provides firm support for your lower back
and has armrests to help reduce fatigue in your shoulders. The chair
should be high enough to get in and out of without strain, and low
enough so you don't have to hunch over while working.
   _ To ease strain on your neck, place text on a tying rack rather
than keeping it flat beside your desk.

   Collecting, from toy soldiers to vintage perfume bottles, is one
way for grandparents to share a hobby or activity with their
grandchildren.
   ``The important thing is that it's a shared activity, a special
bond between you and your grandchild,'' says Stephen Roedler,
director of the Manhattan Arts and Antiques Center in New York.
   ``What's more, when you explore the past together, your
grandchild gets a window into former times and can better appreciate
your world, too.''
   The collection can also encourage other activities, he says, both
with the grandchild and on your own. It could mean enrolling in
courses or seminars and sharing the learning with the grandchildren.
   Museums and galleries, magazines and journals are other
resources, he says.
   Roedler says there are numerous local clubs for collectors, where
news and information is exchanged.
   He suggests the possibility of a club for grandparent-grandchild
collectors.

   When it comes to shopping, mature consumers prefer the
old-fashioned way _ walking around the stores, according to a Baylor
University study.
   The Baylor researchers said the ``gray marketers,'' 55 years or
older, like to see what that are buying before they part with their
money and thus go to the stores rather than order from mailed
catalogs or television or telephone.
   ``Many of them actually prefer the social aspects of going
shopping,'' says Marjorie Caballero, executive director of the
Center for Professional Selling at Baylor's Hankamer School of
Business, Waco, Texas.
   ``They like walking the shops and meeting people. Getting out of
the house is something they look forward to,'' she says.
   She conducted the year-long survey with Baylor Professor Lawrence
Chonko, chairman of the Marketing Department, and former Baylor
faculty member James Lumpkin, now a marketing professor at the
University of Mississippi.
   The study, ``Direct Marketing to the Elderly: Sources of
Dissatisfaction and Remedies,'' was funded by the Andrus Foundation
of the American Association of Retired Persons.
   Sixty percent of the more than 4,000 people surveyed were in the
65-plus age category; 20 percent in the 55-64 age group, and 20
percent were adults up to age 54. More than 2,500 responded to the
survey.
   The study also found that the elderly strongly prefer the
``personal touch'' from sales people and dislike ``high pressure''
sales tactics.
   The survey had some advice for those doing the selling as well.
   ``Be patient with the elderly,'' Caballero suggested. ``Don't
assume because of their age that they cannot understand complex
information. They grasp things just like everybody else, but it may
take them longer.
   ``Don't give them too much clutter to wade through. Their
eyesight may not be quite as good; use larger type in your printed
material, slow down in your approach, simplify, and, above all,
never think of the elderly as `senile' or `cranky' in their ways,''
she says.
   ``They resent these stereotypes.''

   After the children grow up and leave home, there may be a problem
left over: what to do about the piano.
   Don't let it just sit in a corner of the living room gathering
dust, says the National Piano Foundation, which suggests parents of
adult children who have left the nest can find many enjoyable ways
to keep the piano an important part of their homes.
   A piano is not only a beautiful piece of furniture, but it
represents an investment, both in time and money, according to the
foundation.
   ``There are a lot of memories attached to our piano,'' says Paul
Krouse, a publisher from Lake Forest, Ill., who bought the family
piano with his wife, Anne, when they were first married. ``Even
though my eldest daughter _ our piano enthusiast _ has moved out of
the area, I wouldn't dream of giving it up.''
   Although the Krouses are not piano players themselves, they have
kept it in frequent use by hiring pianists to play at several
parties they've hosted. And they have a few friends who play the
piano when they visit.
   One way to enjoy your piano after the kids have stopped playing,
suggests the foundation, is to take lessons yourself.
   James Sevitz, a retired mechanical engineer in Huntington Beach,
Calif., recently began piano lessons, marking the first time he's
studied piano in nearly 50 years and the first time his piano has
been used regularly since his stepdaughter moved out of the house.
   ``When I retired I had all this new-found free time,'' says
Sevitz. ``And the piano wasn't getting much use, so I decided it was
a good time to learn to play _ something I've wanted to do all my
life.''
   Sevitz signed up for a piano class in beginning techniques with
Allen Giles, head of the piano department at Golden West College in
Huntington Beach.
   Giles teaches many adult students, as well as the college's
regular student body, and finds that playing piano is something for
which ``empty-nesters'' and recent retirees are perfectly suited.
   ``Older people make excellent piano students,'' says Giles.
``Those who are retired, of course, have a lot of free time, too.
But even working adults can fit piano study into their schedules and
budgets.''

   Depending on where they work, aging white-collar workers face a
job outlook ranging from ``crash-and-burn'' to a possible triple
career ladder, according to a study of 25 ``Fortune 500'' companies.
   The state of the economy and the industry, the company
``personality,'' the nature of corporate leadership and the
organizational structure were among the factors shaping company
responses to the University of Michigan survey.
   ``All of these factors can change over time, so you cannot lock a
company into a particular behavior pattern,'' says Barbara Hirshorn,
research fellow at the university's Population Studies Center.
   ``It is clear, however, that a company under economic stress is
much more likely to consider actions hurtful to older workers.''
   Typical corporate responses indicated five distinct company
policies toward elder employees, those over 55, Hirshorn notes. They
were characterized as ``pro-active,'' ``performance-focused,'' ``at
cross-purposes,'' ``positive means-negative ends'' and
``antagonistic.''
   ``Pro-active'' companies deal most effectively with older
workers, she explains, planning strategies that build in options for
workers at all ages as well as options for the company as a whole.
   ``Dual or even triple career ladders are not uncommon in
pro-active companies,'' she adds. ``They encourage lateral career
changes and intentionally reassign workers at all ages to relieve
boredom and stress.''
   Hirshorn says ``performance-focused'' companies try to ignore age
as a criterion altogether, consistently applying a reliable
evaluation system to all workers.
   But occasionally, companies are at cross-purposes in their
policies, she notes.
   ``The company ethos may hold older workers in high regard, and
managers may even design some effective policies for them,'' she
says. ``At the same time, they are designing others that have an
unfortunate effect....They don't coordinate policies and plan for
change.''
   An example of such cross-purposes would be companies that offer
limited opportunities for promotion or lateral moves, and massive,
sweetened early retirement programs.
   Some companies are actively antagonistic toward older workers,
and the hostility shows up in a variety of policies, Hirshorn found.
   ``I came across one insurance company where age bias ran deeply
throughout the ranks,'' she recalls. ``Those who refused to relocate
were fired, and since so few employees over 55 were promoted, many
older workers left.''

   Much of the GI generation that fought in World
War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is
retiring in relative comfort, a Florida researcher has reported.
   More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double the
poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at
least three sources, according to Charles F. Longino of the
University of Miami.
   But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation,
Longino reported in American Demographics magazine.
   ``There are a cluster of states with a large share of the
comfortably retired,'' Longino said in analyzing 1980 Census data,
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for the
study.
   Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada and New Jersey had many of
the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong
showings in Connecticut and Washington, Longino found.
   The poverty level for a family of four was $8,414 in 1980.
   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs
that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators
for their Social Security benefits and federal laws protecting
private pensions, Longino noted. In addition, many were able to
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.
   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those
aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in 1980. He termed them the GI
generation after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became a
popular tag for soldiers in the 1940s.
   Just over half (51.1 percent) of those in the 65-74 age group
were listed as comfortable, and 12.3 percent were in the ``elite
elite.''
   For the younger group, 59.1 percent were comfortable and 4.7
percent were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as elite
since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other
retirement benefits.
   The oldest group listed 37.5 percent as comfortable and 8.5
percent as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets and
most completed a large share of their working lives before World War
II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.
   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in
such resort and retirement states as Florida, Nevada and New Jersey;
in Connecticut, where many New York executives have retired, and
Hawaii.
   Hawaii has a large Asian population where extended families are
more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure
used as the basis for this calculation, Longino noted.
   For the pension elite, Connecticut and Washington placed well, as
did Florida, Maryland, New Jersey. Longino also noted that there are
clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.
   He cited as examples Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Fla.; San
Diego and Palm Springs, Calif.; and along the east coast of Mobile
Bay, Ala.
   Longino is director of the Center for Social Research in Aging at
the University of Miami, and his work was partially funded by the
American Association of Retired Persons. American Demographics,
published by Dow Jones & Co. Inc., reports on population matters.

   One-third of elderly Americans living in their communities say
their health is excellent or very good, reports the Statistical
Bulletin, a publication of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
   The findings, among those aged 65 or over, are based on a
National Health Interview Survey conducted in 1983-84. The report
said the proportion does not change among those aged 85 and over.
   However, those interviewed did not include elderly people in
hospitals or nursing homes, the segment in poorest health.
   The proportion of blacks assessing their health as excellent or
very good was one-fourth.
   The most frequently reported disability was arthritis; second was
hypertension.

   In order to detect lung disease, the National Jewish Center for
Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, in Denver, suggests that senior

researchers at the hospital, or how well a person can force air from

   ``Multiple medical problems come with age, resulting in multiple
drugs,'' says the director of geriatric programs at a New York
medical center, who warns users of possible over-medication or
over-accumulation.
   ``Without careful monitoring,'' says Dr. Geraldine Lanman of the
Long Island Jewish Medical Center, New Hyde Park, N.Y., ``the drugs
that keep our elderly alive longer, can also sharply minimize the
quality of life.''
   At the Daughters of Jacob Geriatric Center in New York, where the
average age of the residents is 87, about 80 to 90 percent of them
take a ``medication holiday'' from non-essential medication each
Monday.
   ``The program is designed to cleanse the body, decrease possible
side effects and provide the opportunity to re-evaluate prescription
patterns,'' says Claire Vogelman, president of Daughters of Jacob.
``Ultimately, some medications may be changed, some eliminated
completely.''

   A University of Miami professor says American men over 85 are a
privileged minority, with more money, better health and more social
contact than women the same age.
   According to Charles Longino Jr., an authority on aging

differences was that nearly half the men among America's 2.2 million
very old persons had spouses, while only one-tenth of the women were
still married.

   The dollar was higher in thin trading in Europe
late this morning, but traders said they expected no major movement
in the U.S. currency ahead of Wednesday's release of U.S. trade
figures for October.
   Gold prices also rose.
   Trading volume was light with few players keen to take a strong
position before the trade figures are released and in advance of the
bi-weekly meeting of the Bundesbank on Thursday, when the West
German central bank could decide to raise a key interest rate,
dealers said.
   One trader with a branch of a major U.S. commercial bank in Milan
said the foreign exchange market expects the October trade deficit
to be little changed from its $10.5-billion shortfall in September.
   She said a single-figure deficit would ``clearly be positive''
for the dollar, but cautioned that ``we've seen this year that this
figure is pretty difficult to call accurately.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.49 yen to a closing 122.92 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 122.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.7378 West German marks, up from 1.7330; 1.4645
Swiss francs, up from 1.4605; 5.9415 French francs, up from 5.9240;
1.9622 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9560; 1,283.20 Italian lire, up
from 1,280.25; 1.1988 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1970.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8420, compared with
$1.8490 Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $421 a troy ounce, up
from $420.70 bid late Friday. At midmorning today, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $421, unchanged
from the opening bid.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $421 up from $420.30 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.10 to close at a bid $422.29.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.16 a troy
ounce, unchanged from Friday.

   Share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today, while the dollar edged up against the Japanese yen as
investors remained on the sidelines ahead of trade reports, dealers
said.
   The dollar closed at 122.92 yen, up 0.49 yen from Friday's close
of 122.43 yen. The currency opened at 122.70 yen and traded between
122.70-123.00 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 121.13 points or 0.41
percent to finish trading at 29,672.29. The index, a 34.52-point
winner Friday, gained 40.35 points in early morning trading but
erased the gain and continued to drop.
   The dollar's higher opening in Tokyo followed its firmness in the
Sydney market that opened earlier, dealers said.
   The dollar moved higher as foreign investors purchased the
currency in morning trading but fluctuated around 122.80 yen,
failing to rise beyond the 123-yen level, said a dealer with
Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Once it reached the upper part of the 122-yen range, the dollar
hardly moved,'' the dealer said.
   He said trading was thin because many currency players were
cautious ahead of the release of trade figures this week.
   Japanese trade figures for November were to be released later
today. The U.S. Commerce Department is to report the nation's trade
figure for October on Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, Paul Volcker, former chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, said Sunday in Tokyo that the dollar should stabilize
because its further decline would raise import prices and lead to
inflation in the United States.
   Volcker said in a lecture at a meeting called the '89 Tokyo Forum
that cutting the U.S. fiscal deficits and preventing inflation are
vital for restoring trust in the dollar.
   On the stock exchange, share prices fell as investors stayed on
the sidelines in anticipation of the release of Japanese and U.S.
trade figures this week, said Yoshio Shimoyama of the Nikko
Securities.
   Frequent fluctuations of the index and lack of direction in
trading are typical toward the end of a year, Shimoyama said.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 600 million
shares in inactive trading.

<TEXT>
   Spain's major trade unions, unhappy over the
economic austerity of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's government,
are taking to the streets to demand a bigger share in the country's
new prosperity.
   A broad spectrum of society _ including autoworkers, actresses,
soccer players and sportswriters _ say they will support Wednesday's
general strike called by the socialist General Workers Union and the
communist-dominated Workers Commission.
   Strike organizers say they want to bring the country of 38
million to a standstill to force a change in the government's
economic policies. The unions also called for a demonstration on
Friday in Madrid and said if the government does not respond, more
demonstrations will follow.
   Since taking office in December 1982, Gonzalez has encouraged
moderate wage increases to stem inflation, prod economic growth and
create jobs to cut Spain's 19.3 percent unemployment rate _ the
highest in Western Europe.
   Due partly to lower wage increases backed in the past by the
Workers Union, Spain has been booming since 1986.
   More than 600,000 new jobs have been created, although growing
numbers of youths and women entering the market have kept
unemployment high.
   Annual inflation has dropped from 14.5 percent to 5.1 percent.
   There have been reports of huge profits by Spanish banks and
corporations.
   Now, the unions are demanding a share of the wealth for workers
who sacrificed higher pay in the past few years to help pull Spain
out of a 10-year economic recession.
   The causes of the economic problems included the sharp rise in
oil prices after the oil embargo of the early 1970s, when Spain's
energy needs were met by imported crude, and protectionism under
Franco's 1939-1975 rule.
   What set off the strike call was the Council of Ministers'
passage Oct. 28 of a youth employment plan. It allows businesses who
hire 18- to 25-year-olds for six to eight months at wages below the
minimum to reduce their contributions to the government social
security plan.
   The government said the plan will create incentives to hire
youths. An estimated 40 percent of the age group have never held a
job.
   Unions say the plan exploits young people, benefits businesses,
and jeopardizes jobs and pay for older workers.
   The nationwide general strike would be the first in Spain since
October 1934, when a leftist-inspired work stoppage turned into an
insurrection that was put down by troops commanded by Gen. Francisco
Franco under orders from the then-conservative government of the
Second Republic.
   Analysts do not expect violence this time, but the feud between
union leaders and top Socialist Party officials has taken on the
hallmarks of a dramatic showdown.
   Nicolas Redondo, head of the General Workers Union, has compared
remarks from Socialist Party executive Jose Maria Benegas
criticizing the planned strike to comments by Nazi propaganda chief
Joseph Goebbels.
   Gonzalez, in turn, has accused the Workers Union of ``sliding
toward the red,'' falling under the influence of the more combative
communist union.
   When right-wing and centrist opposition parties, with Socialist
support, tried to pass a motion to urge the unions to call off the
strike, two small leftist parties voted against it. Approval
required a unanimous vote.
   Newspapers described the incident as a sign of the
ineffectiveness of the parties and parliament in breaking the
union-government impasse.
   After union-government wage talks broke down in the autumn, the
unions began accusing the Gonzalez government of arrogance and lack
of ``social sensitivity.''
   In a recent news conference, Gonzalez acknowledged that some
arrogance could have creeped into his government but said this was
no reason to stage a general strike.

nine-month inspection uncovered safety violations and ``what appear
to be systemic deficiencies'' with the management of the nation's
commuter airlines.
   The FAA said Friday its examination of the commuter industry
showed that while there are some air carriers that were found in
full compliance with federal air regulations ``others demonstrated a
need for significant improvements.''
   The inspections, which covered 35 airlines, resulted in 1,284
violations of air safety regulations, about one-third of which were
considered serious enough to warrant a possible civil penalty.

   A federal judge says MAI Basic Four Inc.
understated the role of its investment banker during its $970
million offer for Prime Computer Inc. and said he would issue an
order halting the hostile bid.
   But U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone said Friday he would
stay the order pending an appeal by MAI Basic.
   Mazzone said that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had played a much
larger role in the deal than MAI Basic, which is controlled by New
York investor Bennett S. LeBow, had disclosed in filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

   Lawrence Arthur Wien, a lawyer, real
estate agent and philanthropist who donated millions of dollars to
education and the arts, died of prostate cancer Saturday at his
home. He was 83 years old.
   The founder and senior partner in the New York law firm of Malkin
and Bettex, Wien was known primarily for giving millions of dollars
to schools, the arts, civic and welfare organizations.
   Wien said in a 1982 interview that after providing financial
security for his family, ``I decided to have the fun of giving my
money away.''
   Among his major contributions was $8.5 million to Brandeis
University, including an endowment fund called the Wien
International Scholarship that assists 15 foreign students with
tuition and support each year.
   He donated more than $20 million to his alma mater, Columbia
University, including $6 million to replace the university's
crumbling football stadium.
   He was recognized as a pioneer in real-estate investment
syndications. He organized syndicates that at one time controlled
more than $2 billion worth of real estate, including many New York
City landmarks.
   Over the years, Wien served as president of the Federation of
Jewish Philanthropists, as a trustee of Columbia University and of
Brandeis, and on the New York City Council Against Poverty. He was
also a patron of the New York City Ballet and New York City Opera.
   He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two daughters; two brothers; a
sister; six grandchildren; and five great-great grandchildren.

<HEAD>EEC Concludes Textiles Agreement With China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission said Monday it had
concluded a new four-year agreement on trade in textiles with China.
   The agreement, to replace the existing pact which expires at the
end of the year, will increase slightly the European Economic
Community's imports of textiles from China.
   The accord also places new restrictions on selected textile
imports including synthetic yarn, knitted gloves and suits.
   In addition, some textile products that were not subject to
quotas under the existing agreement will be brought under quota
coverage, the commission said.
   Textiles account for about one third of China's exports to the
EEC. They rose to 1.24 billion European currency units, or $1.47
billion in 1987 from 893.6 million Ecus,or $1.06 million in 1986.

<HEAD>Tenneco Still Profitable After Oil and Gas Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision to sell off Tenneco Oil Co. was a
difficult one, but the mammoth $7.3 billion sale still leaves
Tenneco Inc. with five profitable businesses.
   After the sale, the Houston-based company remains the city's
largest public company, with 1988 revenue close to $13 billion, and
projected revenue of about $14 billion in 1990.
   ``I think it will surprise a lot of people to realize that we are
as big as this without the oil company,'' Tenneco Chairman James L.
Ketelsen said in a wide-ranging interview published in Sunday's
editions of the Houston Chronicle.
   Ketelsen said the Tenneco Oil sale was difficult not only because
of the impact on the nearly 9,000 oil company and corporate
employees involved, but also because of Tenneco's new identity as a
``diversified industrial corporation.''
   The company's other businesses include shipbuilding, automotive,
chemicals, packaging and natural gas pipeline operations, which are
all making money.
   One business making money is Case IH, the construction and farm
equipment company that Tenneco formed in 1985 when JI Case acquired
the agricultural implement division of International Harvester Co.
for $513 million.
   Since then, Tenneco has plowed more than $700 million in capital
expenditures into the subsidiary. Case IH has become the company's
biggest business, but it has yet to show a profit.
   Ketelsen has designated 1989 as the make-or-break year for Case
IH. If the profit are not there, Case IH could have a ``for sale''
sign hanging on its corporate door.
   But Roger Khlopin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York
doubts that Tenneco has plans to divest any other operations.
   ``Nothing this company has said has led anyone to believe they
would sell anything other than exploration and production,'' he
said. ``They're building up, not ripping down.''
   Although Case IH's performance has fallen short of expectations,
Ketelsen said, the Harvester acquisition and the subsequent
consolidation and reorganization of Case IH were planned as a
five-year project.
   What the company did not count on was the recession in the U.S.
farm belt that resulted in North American tractor sales falling from
90,000 in 1984 to 61,000 in 1986 and 1987, or last summer's drought
that made many farmers postpone new equipment purchases.
   To help matters, Tenneco installed a new management team at the
Case IH headquarters in Racine, Wis. The new president, James K.
Ashford, previously headed Tenneco Automotive, which more than
doubled its operating income during his five years as the top
executive.
   Tenneco's other business segments are demonstrating growth and
improved profit at rates ranging from modest to booming, Ketelsen
said.
   Natural gas transmission is Tenneco's original business and its
second largest source of revenue after agricultural and construction
equipment. Since the natural gas transmission industry is mature,
overall growth opportunities are limited, he said.
   Nevertheless, the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Group is a consistently
strong earner and supplier of cash flow, Ketelsen said. Its
20,000-mile system from Texas and the Gulf of Mexico to New England
serves one of the two areas where demand for natural gas is growing.
   Increases in federal defense spending since 1981 have helped
Tenneco's Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. grow at a
compound annual rate of 15.6 percent, but Ketelsen acknowledged that
defense expenditures probably will be cut in the Bush administration.
   An $8 billion backlog that includes construction of two aircraft
carriers and two submarines, along with future contracts for
modernization and upgrading of existing U.S. Navy vessels, should
ensure at least incremental growth, the Tenneco chairman said.
   Packaging Corporation of America offers the best potential for
solid growth, Ketelsen said. Although it is the second-smallest
Tenneco unit by revenues, PCA should have the second-highest
operating profits for 1988 and should grow at an annual rate of 15
percent to 20 percent over the next five years, he said.
   Cardboard boxes are PCA's primary product. Ketelsen said $65
million of PCA's projected 1988 operating income of $220 million
will come from specialty products the company did not make five
years ago.
   Albright & Wilson Ltd. of London, a specialty chemicals producer
and Tenneco's smallest subsidiary, should grow an average of 20
percent for the next five years, the chairman said.
   Albright & Wilson is a major supplier of phosphates for
detergents, soaps and shampoos, primarily in Europe, and is the
world's largest producer of sodium chlorate, used to bleach paper
products.
   Tenneco Automotive has grown at a 13 percent rate for the past
five years and is the leading manufacturer of mufflers, exhaust
systems and shock absorbers for the replacement parts and
accessories market.
   Tenneco's other two major business segments _ natural gas
pipelines and shipbuilding _ also will be solid performers, though
not as the others, Ketelsen said.

<HEAD>Reports Raise Hopes that Higher Interest Rates Are Working</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales fell by a larger-than-expected 0.5
percent in November as producer prices rose 0.3 percent, less than
forecast, the government said Monday, raising hopes that higher
interest rates were slowing down consumer spending and inflation.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 7.5
points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,742.8 after the Department of Trade and
Industry issued its two reports late in the morning. But the index
had been down as much as 11.8 points shortly before the economic
figures were released. The pound held steady at about $1.8405.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson pushed up interest rates
to 13 percent from a decade low of 7.5 percent in June to discourage
consumer spending and curb inflation, which has picked up to an
annual rate of 6.4 percent from 3.3 percent in January.
   Private economists had forecast a rise or fall of 0.2 percent in
retail sales and a 0.4-percent gain in producer prices.
   ``There are fairly clear signs that growth in retail sales is a
lot slower than it was earlier this year,'' said economist Gwyn
Hacche of the London investment firm James Capel and Co. ``It's in
the right direction.''
   But he added: ``I wouldn't expect there to be clear evidence of
the kind of slowdown we want probably for a few months. Really, the
growth has got to come down quite a lot further.''
   Retail sales were up 5.2 percent from November 1987, the
Department of Trade and Industry said.
   By comparison, retail sales volume rose 2.0 percent in October
from the previous month and was up 6.2 percent from a year earlier.
   Producer output prices, or prices of manufactured goods, were up
4.8 percent from November 1987, the department reported.
   By comparison, output prices rose 0.4 percent in October from the
previous month and were up 4.7 percent from a year earlier. These
figures weren't seasonally adjusted.

<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs increased
by 17 this week to total 922, ending a period of decline marked by
price instability, industry watcher Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   Monday's increase followed a two-week period in which the number
of working rigs dropped by 18. Last week, the count dropped by six
to total 905.
   A year ago the count was 1,181, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of
last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981 at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   The lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on May 2.
   Among major oil producing states, the biggest gains were posted
by New Mexico, with seven additional rigs, followed by California,
three; Kansas, Ohio and Wyoming, two each; and North Dakota,
Pennsylvania and Texas, one each.
   Oklahoma had the greatest decline with three fewer rigs, followed
by Colorado and Louisiana, with one each. Michigan was unchanged
from the previous week.

   The stock market headed higher today, extending
last week's gains as traders awaited a spate of economic reports due
out over the next several days.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.94 to 2,150.43 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 483 up, 396 down and
545 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.54 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said trading interest was concentrated in a few blue
chips and stocks involved in takeover news and rumors.
   The week began in an atmosphere of caution about prospects for
Federal Reserve policy and interest rates, and the pending monthly
report due out Wednesday on the nation's international trade balance.
   Brokers said it would be no surprise if Fed policymakers, meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday, decided to tighten credit conditions a bit
further, especially if the news on trade isn't good.
   Advance estimates call for the October data to be about the same
as September's, when imports exceeded exports by $9 billion,
excluding freight and insurance costs.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Ford Motor, up [ at 52{;
International Business Machines, up \ at 120|; International Paper,

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

index was down .37 at 297.24.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.78 to 2,143.49,
closing out the week with a net gain of 51.21 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 on the

economic news.
   The government reported a 0.5-percent fall in retail sales volume
in November, which dealers said supported the view that recent rises
in British interest rates had begun to bite into the country's
consumer boom.
   Most private organizations had forecast a rise or fall of 0.2

   Volume was light, as 230.1 million shares changed hands by

   A separate report on British producer output prices showed a rise
of 0.3 percent in November from October and of 4.8 percent from
November 1987. These figures, at the bottom end of market
expectations, also were favorable, dealers said.

<HEAD>Church's Chicken Decides To Close Unprofitable Units</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church's Fried Chicken, embroiled in a battle
to prevent a hostile takeover by Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and
Biscuits, announced today it would immediately close 120 of its
stores, whose losses have totaled $7.4 million in the past year.
   ``Our decision to close certain unprofitable stores within the
Church's system will have a positive effect on cash flow,'' Ernest
Renaud, president and chief financial officer of the San
Antonio-based company, said in a statement.
   ``The closings are an important part of our plan to improve
profitability of Church's,'' he said. The closings will be in 20
states.
   In the statement, Renaud said the closings would allow for
between $22 million and $27 million in write-offs for this fiscal
year.
   Church's, which has gone through several management changes in
the past two years, currently has about 1,500 restaurants and is
second in the fast-food chicken industry behind Kentucky Fried
Chicken. Popeyes is third in the industry with about 725 restaurants.
   Church's expects to see sales this year of $520 million, down
from $570 million in 1986 and $633 million in 1984.
   Popeyes is expected to have sales of $485 million this year.
   The restaurant closings come at a time when Church's is in the
midst of a takeover battle with New Orleans-based Popeyes, which has
made an $8-per-share, $290 million unsolicited bid for Church's.
   Church's board of directors has rejected the offer as inadequate.
The company also claims that former Church's employees gave Popeyes
confidential information which it used in the takeover bid.
   A federal judge in New Orleans earlier this month issued an order
preventing Popeyes' owner Al Copeland from buying Church's stock
until 10 working days after Popeyes revealed information on its
buyout offer.
   Popeyes' first takeover deadline was Nov. 30, but has been
extended to Friday. Copeland says he already owns 3.2 percent of
Church's stock and has been offered 14.6 million shares _ or about
40.6 percent _ of the 35.9 million outstanding shares of Church's
stock.
   Meanwhile, Church's has been courting offers from other
investors, but also has become the subject of a class-action suit
filed by a shareholder who claims the offer by Popeyes is adequate
and that the Church's board's refusal to accept it could cost
shareholders huge profits.

<HEAD>Largest Holding Company Forecasts Big Loss This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's
largest holding company, Monday forecast a loss of between 500
million and 2 billion Belgian francs _ between $13.5 and $54 million
_ this year due to restructuring costs.
   But the company said it expected much better results next year,
possibly more than doubling the 3.611 billion francs, or $97.5
million, profit made last year.
   SGB said in a statement that its operating results would have
totaled about 10 billion francs, or $270.2 million, in 1988 if
restructuring costs were not subtracted.
   Those costs, however, were estimated to be between 10.5 billion
francs and 12 billion francs, or the equivalent of $283.8 to $324.3
million, wiping out the profit and leaving the estimated loss of 500
million to 2 billion francs.
   The company predicted that it would post operating results of
about 12 billion francs in 1989 but declined to give a specific net
profit forecast because the extent of restructuring costs was
uncertain for that year.
   Meanwhile in Paris, French company Suez, now the leading SGB
shareholder, announced that that Compagnie Generale d'Electricite
would sell its 3.3 percent stake in SGB in order to acquire a 2.8
percent holding.
   Belgian Groupe AG, second SGB shareholder, confirmed that
Sodecom, the holding company which contained 42 percent of SGB, was
being divided into three new units.
   One will be fully controlled by Suez, a second by Groupe AG and
the two companies will share the third.
   Groupe AG said that an effort will be made to return 12 percent
of SGB shares to the public. Only two percent are currently traded
and an additional 5 percent is being placed with institutional
investors.

   Lawrence Perlman, chief operating

   In addition, Thomas C. Roberts, president of Control Data's
Systems and Services Group, will leave the company ``to pursue other

named.
   Perlman takes over presidential duties from Robert M. Price,

himself of responsibility for day-to-day operations and concentrate
on long-range strategy, said company spokesman Frank Ryan.
   The position of chief operating officer had been vacant, Ryan

executive vice president and chief financial officer, has been
promoted to vice chairman and retains the title of chief financial
officer.
   Control Data provides computer products and services for
business, scientific and engineering applications worldwide.
   Last month, the company said it may record an earnings loss in
the fourth quarter that ``could nearly equal the profit recorded
through the first nine months of 1988, which would result in
approximately break-even earnings for the year.''
   It attributed the change in earnings' outlook to ``continued
slippages in shipments and acceptances'' in its computer products
division.

outstanding, said it would pay other stockholders $100 a share for
the rest.
   Pennwalt's stock rocketed higher on the New York Stock Exchange
after the announcement, from $83 at Friday's close to $98 a share
around mid-day today.
   Company officials declined to comment on the offer. But Pennwalt,
a rumored takeover target for months, had taken several defensive
steps to thwart any unwelcome suitors, including the $460 million
sale of pharmaceutical operations three months ago and a stock
repurchase completed last week.
   ``We believe that our offer represents a fair price and is in the
best interest of Pennwalt's shareholders,'' Centaur principals Abbey
J. Butler and Melvyn J. Estrin said in a letter to Pennwalt
management.
   The partners, who claimed to have assembled bank financing to
make the purchase, said they were willing to negotiate any aspect of
their offer including price.
   At the same time, the partners indicated they would resort to
more hostile means to buy Pennwalt, saying they had moved to
invalidate the company's so-called ``poison pill'' shareholders
rights plan with a lawsuit in Philadelphia federal court.
   The poison pill, which many companies have adopted, is designed
to make an unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Pennwalt produces and markets industrial chemicals, and is a
leading maker of chlorinated plastic, commonly used in building
cable insulation. The company, which had sales of nearly $1.2
billion last year, also has operations in mineral and petroleum
processing.
   In August, the company sold its pharmaceutical unit, maker of
products such as Allerest allergy relief pills and Desenex foot
powder, to the British firm Fisons. Pennwalt also repurchased about
37.6 percent of its outstanding stock as part of a plan to boost the
price.
   Those moves were seen partly as a defensive move against Centaur
principals Butler and Estrin, financiers who had indicated they
might make an offer for Pennwalt.
   Butler, 51, is former chairman of Financial World magazine and is
president of C.B. Equities Corp., a New York-based investment
portfolio mangement company. Estrin, 45, is a Washington-based
investor and former chairman of American Health Services, a hospital
and nursing home management concern.

   The stock market gained ground today, extending
last week's advance as traders awaited a spate of economic reports
due out over the next several days.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 51.21 points last
week, rose 12.63 to 2,156.12 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 724 up, 552 down and
566 unchanged.
   Analysts said stocks seemed to draw some benefit from a rise in
the dollar against leading foreign currencies and declines in
open-market interest rates.
   The week began in an atmosphere of caution about prospects for
Federal Reserve policy and interest rates, and the pending monthly
report due out Wednesday on the nation's international trade balance.
   Brokers said it would be no surprise if Fed policymakers, meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday, decided to tighten credit conditions a bit
further, especially if the news on trade isn't good.
   Advance estimates call for the October data to be about the same
as September's, when imports exceeded exports by $9 billion,
excluding freight and insurance costs.
   Pennwalt jumped 15] to 98|. A New York partnership said it would
offer $100 apiece for the Pennwalt shares it doesn't already own.
   Pillsbury climbed 4\ to 62{. Grand Metropolitan PLC raised its

<HEAD>Scramble Under Way for New TV Stations in Portugal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It has all the ingredients for the kind
of soap opera television viewers love: an intriguing former prime
minister, international big business and the Roman Catholic Church
fighting for wealth and power.
   But this is not Dallas. This is Portugal. And a real-life battle
for control of one or two new, commercial television channels is
brewing in Western Europe's poorest nation.
   Most observers say former Social Democrat Prime Minister
Fransisco Pinto Balsemao, publisher of the country's most respected
weekly paper, Expresso, is in the best position to win the first
concession.
   But British press baron Robert Maxwell and the Portuguese Church
are also eager to profit by bringing information, opinion and, above
all, advertising, into the homes of Portugal's 10 million
inhabitants.
   RTP, Portugal's 32-year-old, two-channel state television system,
already carries advertising.
   According to Radio Televisao Commercial, the commercial arm of
RTP, 72.9 percent of Portuguese watch TV every day. RTC says this is
the highest rate in Western Europe.
   The most popular programs _ usually early evening ``TV novels''
like ``Roque Santeiro'' imported from Portuguese-speaking Brazil _
find up to 90 percent of the country's viewing population glued to
the screen.
   ``There is certainly demand for more choice _ new stations,''
said Fernando Santos, sales director at RTC, adding that many
Portuguese, especially in poorer, isolated, rural areas have little
other entertainment.
   ``They're all waiting for private TV because they think it will
bring better programs.''
   But some enterprising Portuguese cannot wait. High-powered
satellite dishes, capable of picking up neighboring Spain's two
programs and several Eurosatellite channels, have sprouted on more
affluent rooftops in Lisbon, Oporto and the southern Algarve.
   At 200,000 escudos (about $1,300) per dish, the antennae are too
expensive for the average Portuguese, whose minimum monthly wage is
27,100 escudos ($179) _ about half that of Spain and a quarter of
the minimum monthly wage in France.
   Poorer areas often solve the problem by pooling cash to buy
communal dishes that can pick up programs from abroad for easy _ but
illegal _ retransmission by cable to individual homes.
   Plans to introduce commercial television via private extension of
the regular network were first discussed in 1982 but only now are
likely to become a reality.
   In October Social Democrat Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and
the main opposition Socialist Party reached an agreement to secure
the necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority on a vote expected
next spring to change the constitutional clause that restricts
private ownership of TV stations.
   But the government could set up new channels by concession now
without having to transfer ownership.
   ``It's very much a question of political will,'' Balsemao said,
and, according to RTC's Santos, a new commercial channel could be up
and running by the end of 1989.
   Balsemao has already attracted support from Portuguese publishing
circles and a minority participation from Britain's independent
Granada TV, to register SIC _ Independent Society for Communication.
   He sees privatization of RTP-2, the second state-owned channel,
as the quickest way to bring commercial television to Portugal.
   ``The longer the government waits, the more inroads foreign TV
interests will make here, and the more difficult it will be for new
Portuguese stations to break into the market.''
   Maxwell, head of Maxwell Communications PLC and publisher of a
new European newspaper, could be one of the foreign interests.
   Maxwell Communications has set up a joint venture with Lisbon
communications concern Emaudio International connected with
Socialist President Mario Soares and has already started to make
inroads into the Portuguese media market.
   ``Our principal objective is to control a regular TV channel, but
we plan to go ahead with the launch of a Portuguese satellite
channel by 1990 at the latest,'' Raul Junqueiro, mastermind of
Emaudio's TV plans, said.
   Emaudio is already making headway in the expanding newspaper
market here. Two weeks ago, it launched the first of two planned
newspapers _ a non-glossy, investigative weekly called Primeira
Pagina. Maxwell plans to launch a daily called ``24 Horas'' by the
end of January.
   Magalhaes Crespo, president of the Administrative Council of
Radio Renascenca, the Church's nationwide radio network, and
frontman for the future Televisao Catolica, says the Church's
position as a mainstay of Portugal's education system gives it a
right to own a TV channel.
   Market surveys show 29 percent of adult listeners tune in to
Radio Renascenca, a figure twice that of the combined audience of
its two state-owned competitors.
   But many are wary of the objectivity of a Church-controlled
channel.
   ``It's true we are conservative in our outlook,'' Crespo said.
``But, in the case of our radio station, we never mix comment with
information.''
   More channels may not mean better television, Santos of RTC said.
   ``If these new channels want to make profits, they will have to
resort to showing low-cost repeats of old films.''
   It costs 10 times as much to produce a home-grown product, he
said, than to buy a foreign import.

   When Chris Crowell says his latest project
folded, it's not a matter for concern. All his schemes collapse by
design.
   Crowell, 55, is the founder and president of Structural Graphics
Inc., a Connecticut company that specializes in print advertisements
that pop up, play music and flash lights.
   His company's work has been displayed in millions of magazines,
numerous sales brochures and store displays. It also has been
featured in books and greeting cards, and hung from the ceilings and
walls of businesses across the country.
   One recent pop-up advertisement his company produced for Camel
cigarettes was used to mark that brand's 75th anniversary. Readers
of the March issue of Rolling Stone magazine who opened up the
advertising insert on page 16 had a cigarette-smoking camel pop up,
while an electronic chip played ``Happy Birthday.''
   Crowell's company produced 1.5 million such inserts, a sign of
how far three-dimensional ads have come since Structural Graphics
was established in 1976.
   The business began with fewer than a handful of employees in a
colonial-style home in Old Lyme. Crowell, whose background was in
graphics and advertising, was convinced that 3-D ads deserved a
place in business, and he went after skeptical advertising
executives.
   ``I began pushing to get the advertising industry interested,''
he said during a recent interview. ``Now, they believe it works.''
   Crowell said the big break came in 1984, when his company
designed an advertising insert for Yves Saint Laurent's ``Paris''
perfume in Vogue magazine. When a seal on the ad was broken, a
bouqet of roses popped open and the smell of perfume was released.
   ``We had been primarily in direct mail until that time,'' Crowell
said, explaining his company is now deeply involved in magazine
inserts.
   Crowell says Structural Graphics is one of the largest companies
in its field, but he declined to release sales figures for the
privately owned firm. He said he produces between 50 million and 100
million 3-D pieces a year. A pop-up can cost as little as 15 cents
or as much as $10 apiece.
   ``We get a kick out of just making effective (ads) and making
them pay for the advertiser,'' Crowell said. ``It's almost as good
as the money.''
   Crowell takes pride in his company's innovation, citing numerous
awards and patents. For instance, Structural Graphics launched the
first musical print advertisement in December 1987 in People
magazine. The two-page spread for Canadian Mist featured a winter
scene and the Christmas carole, ``Deck The Halls.''
   The business of producing a 3-D ad typically begins when an
advertising agency contacts Structural Graphics with a proposal.
Once presented with an idea, Crowell unleashes a team of engineers
and others who design a pop-up to fit the agency's requirements.
   Once the ad is accepted, it is printed outside Structural
Graphics and then assembled, usually by hand, by about 300 people
employed at a company plant in Piedras Negras, Mexico. Some smaller
volume ads also can be completed at the Structural Graphics plant in
Essex or another in Dallas. The projects take 20 to 25 days to
complete.
   Because of the work involved, 3-D ads are more expensive than
ordinary print ads. As a result, companies interested in the ads are
usually major companies seeking to promote themselves or new
products, said Eric Thruelsen, Structrual Graphics marketing and
sales director.
   The company's list of clients includes Xerox, Ford, General
Motors, IBM, MacDonald's, Pitney Bowes and Donald Trump.
   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. decided to use a 3-D ad as part of its
Camel promotion because it wanted to ``celebrate in a contemporary
fashion,'' said Seth W. Moskowtiz, a senior public relations
representative at the cigarette maker. The musical ad was the first
of its kind in the tobacco industry, where 300 styles compete for
consumer dollars.
   ``We were looking for eye-stoppingness, and in this case, also
ear-stoppingness,'' he said.
   Crowell said advertisers like 3-D ads because they are extremely
effective. Studies conducted by Crowell's companies and others have
shown that as many as 90 percent of those who see a pop-up ad also
read it, he said. A typical print ad has about a 30 percent
readership ``if it's lucky,'' Crowell said.
   Crowell believes the surface has barely been scratched for 3-D
advertising. He said he's always coming up with new ideas and has
yet to put most of them into production.
   ``It's being used, but not as much as the media blows it up,'' he
said. ``Lots and lots of people are considering it.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus continued to rise in November,
shooting up 38 percent to $6.55 billion from $4.75 billion a year
earlier, the Finance Ministry said Monday.
   Japan's surplus with the United States climbed to $4.42 billion
from $4.21 billion a year earlier, the ministry said, reversing 11
straight months of decline.
   While the overall November surplus was smaller than October's
$7.69 billion surplus, it surpassed forecasts of a $6.5 billion
surplus.
   Exports surged 19.5 percent over a year earlier to $22.6 billion
from $18.9 billion, while imports climbed 13.4 percent over a year
earlier to $16.1 billion from $14.2 billion, ministry officials said.
   The officials predicted that strong export growth ``will continue
in the future.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many business consultants make a very good living
analyzing corporate weaknesses and devising fix-up procedures that
include new people, equipment and processes.
   Much time is involved. Lots of money. Repeated conferences too.
Computer reports and graphs ``prove'' the erudition of the
consultants. Indeed, if impressions were the measure of results
these analyses would be invaluable.
   Contrast this complicated procedure with another approach,
championed by a respected consultant, in which you focus on one
problem or an aspect of one, attack it immediately with existing
talent and produce immediate results.
   ``I've never seen a company in which it cannot be done,'' says
Robert H. Schaffer, who has written a remarkable book of common
sense and canny insight, buttressed by more than 25 years of
experience.
   While companies ``search far and wide for esoteric formulas to
get them back in the running, some very powerful solutions lie close
at hand,'' he says.
   Schaffer, based in Stamford, Conn., has demonstrated his theories
in big companies and small, and now relates the story in ``The
Breakthrough Strategy: Using Short-Term Success to Build The High
Performance Organization.''
   It confirms some widely held suspicions that management problems
aren't as complicated as they might seem, that they seldom require
the immediate purchase of new equipment, and that they can be solved
today rather than tomorrow.
   Overly simplified, Schaffer preaches results-based management
development, of which this is an example:
   In January 1986, Pennwalt Corp.'s headquarters informed Wayne
O'Quinn, manager of its Calvert City, Kentucky plant, that a
corporate study to evaluate the facility's future was underway.
   The reason: Costs of its key chemical products were overly high
and its market was eroding. After 37 years of operation, the future
of the plant and the jobs of its 400 employees were on the line.
   Seventeen improvement teams, organized months before to tackle
the plant's myriad problems, had failed to produce significant
gains, partly because their efforts were too broad. Now they sought
to focus on one critical element.
   The results showed up. In just eight weeks they were able to
raise by 20 percent the feed rate of raw materials into one kiln
among the many used to produce chemical reactions. Success!
   This first success changed the character of their turnaround
efforts. Now they felt they could produce change. The team moved on
to other kilns with productive results. Then they moved on to other
projects, one at a time.
   Over the next six months the plant's managers were able to reduce
overall production costs by 18 percent, focusing on one task at a
time, benefiting from the enthusiasm and confidence generated by
their successes.
   Schaffer, head of Robert H. Schaffer & Associates, is a devout
believer in the principle that problems refined to their elements
can be simple to deal with, whereas problems taken as a whole can be
impossibly difficult.
   His approach is to get results at once, utilizing the personnel
and other resources already existing within a company. Why, he asks,
does a crisis so often produce its own solution, where months of
earlier effort had failed?
   Why? Because a crisis produces a real sense of urgency, a
personal challenge to workers, a sense of shared commitment to a
well-defined goal, a freedom to experiment with new ideas, and a
feeling of imminent success.
   He calls them ``zest factors.'' While he doesn't believe in
creating artificial crises, he does think it important to recognize
the lessons that crises produce. Zest factors can be used to
mobilize effective action.
   In his book, produced by Ballinger Publishing Co., a subsidiary
of Harper & Row, he describes how initial successes become launching
pads for a continuing process of improvement.
   He asserts that companies can build their basic capacity to
compete in the long-term while _ in fact, because of _ obtaining a
succession of small but immediate and tangible successes.
   Rarely, does a business consultant offer you simplicity of
approach, low cost, immediate results and a procedure for a
continuing, never ending series of improvements.

<HEAD>Grand Met Raises Offer for Pillsbury; Company Chairmen Meet</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 3 new grafs to UPDATE with Pillsbury rejecting
higher tender offer, editing to conform; picks up 3rd graf pvs,
Grand Met said...</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC of Britain today
increased its cash tender offer for Pillsbury Co. common stock by $3
per share to $63, but Pillsbury quickly rejected the proposal as it
had a separate offer for a richer, negotiated deal.
   Late Sunday, Grand Met had said it would amend its tender offer
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amended
offer values Pillsbury's more than 86 million outstanding shares at
about $5.42 billion.
   But Pillsbury's board of directors immediately rejected the
$63-per-share offer as ``inadequate and not in the best interests of
the company and its shareholders.''
   Grand Met said Sunday it decided to raise its formal tender offer
after Minneapolis-based Pillsbury declined to endorse its offer to
pay $65 a share for a friendly, negotiated acquisition.
   Pillsbury had said earlier Sunday night that Grand Met was
willing to raise its offer to as much as $66 a share.
   Both companies issued statements saying that Pillsbury Chairman
Philip L. Smith met over the weekend with Grand Met Chief Executive
Officer Allen Sheppard in New York but did not reach an agreement.
   The jockeying occurred ahead of a hearing this afternoon in
Delaware Chancery Court on Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover
measures, the cornerstone of its defense against Grand Met. The
British company's offer is conditioned on the removal of the pill.
   As of Friday night, stockholders had tendered 87.4 percent of
Pillsbury shares to Grand Met under its $60 bid. Grand Met, a major
hotel and beverage conglomerate, has declined to buy any of the
shares until the court rules on Pillsbury's defense.
   Court Chancellor William Duffy has told participants that after
oral arguments today, he will make a decision by the end of this
week.
   At an initial meeting Friday evening, Pillsbury said Sheppard
indicated he was prepared to increase Grand Met's offer to $63 a
share. Smith responded that he ``was not willing to discuss at this
time'' a price which was not in the range of $68 to $73 a share,
Pillsbury's statement said.
   On Saturday morning, Grand Met indicated it was making a formal
offer of $65 a share for a negotiated acquisition, according to both
companies' statements.
   Pillsbury said its board of directors met Sunday but there was
``no enthusiasm'' for the $65-a-share proposal.
   At a meeting Sunday afternoon, Sheppard indicated that although
$65 was his official final offer, $66 a share ``could be
available,'' according to Pillsbury's statement.
   According to Grand Met's statement, Sheppard said Friday night
the British company was willing to pay $63 per share and ``perhaps a
little more'' in a negotiated acquisition, but didn't specify how
much more.
   Pillsbury said its board has authorized Smith to be available for
any discussions with Grand Met officials ``which are designed to
maximize values to Pillsbury shareholders.''
   The fight to take over Pillsbury, a company that includes the
Burger King fast-food chain as well as a variety of products bearing
the Pillsbury brand, has coincided with the even bigger takeover of
food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco, which was bought in a leveraged
buyout last week in a deal estimated to be worth about $25 billion.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies on
Monday in Europe after spending most of the day fluctuating in a
narrow range, and gold prices declined.
   Dealers said there was no particular reason for the dollar's
strength on Monday. Trading generally was trendless because most
market participants were awaiting the release Wednesday of U.S.
trade figures for October, they said.
   The trade deficit was expected to be little changed in October
from September's seasonally adjusted $10.4 billion. But a few
dealers said they were more bearish, and were looking for a gap
between $11 billion and $12 billion.
   One dealer said a smaller-than-expected deficit would boost the
dollar to its next resistance level at 1.7750 West German marks,
while a bearish figure would depress the dollar to the next big
support level, which is 1.7150 marks.
   The dollar rose to 1.7410 marks on Monday from 1.7330 marks on

<HEAD>Grain Futures Rally On Export Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain futures closed higher Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid unconfirmed rumors of impending grain sales to
the Soviet Union, but soybean prices finished mostly lower in
response to weekend rains in South America.
   Traders were expecting the Agriculture Department to offer the
Soviet Union up to 3 million metric tons of wheat at subsidized
prices, analysts said.
   The Soviets also were rumored to be in the market for up to 1
million metric tons of U.S. corn and sorghum, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   But the soybean market declined on reports of significant weekend
rainfall in Brazil and Argentina, where hot, dry weather has forced
delays in soybean planting, analysts said.
   ``They got good rains and there's more in the forecasts for both
Brazil and Argentina, especially Argentina,'' Lespinasse said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with December
at $4.28{ a bushel; corn was 1} cents to 5 cents higher with
December at $2.61\ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 4{ cents higher
with December at $2.08 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 4\
cents higher with January at $7.70 a bushel.

   The stock market showed a small gain today,
extending last week's advance as traders awaited a spate of economic
reports due out over the next several days.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 51.21 points last
week, rose 8.00 to 2,151.49 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading

   Analysts said stocks seemed to draw some benefit from a rise in
the dollar against leading foreign currencies and declines in

   Brokers said it would be no surprise if Fed policymakers, meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday, decided to tighten credit conditions a bit

<TEXT>
   Church's Fried Chicken Inc., which is fighting
a hostile takeover takeover bid from a rival restaurant chain, said
Monday it was closing 120 unprofitable restaurants and taking
writeoffs of up to $27 million.
   Church's is scrambling to fend off the hostile overtures from the
parent of New Orleans-based Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and
Biscuits, whose latest $8-per-share, $290 million offer expires
Friday.
   Ernest Renaud, Church's president and chief executive officer,
said the restaurant closings in 20 states involved outlets that lost
$7.4 million in the past 12 months. He said the losses from the
restaurants were affecting the company's cash flow as it struggled
with tough economic situations and the takeover attempt.
   There will be 24 closings in Texas; 12 in Illinois; 10 in
Alabama, nine in Virginia, seven in Ohio, six in Kansas and Missouri
and three to four each in several other states.
   ``There was just too much chicken competition in those areas. We
just overbuilt,'' Renaud said. ``We were taking big losses for a
long time. These units were just a big drain.
   ``They should have been closed a year ago, but this is just part
of my plan to make the company profitable again,'' he said.
   Renaud said the comapny would take write-offs of between $22
million and $27 million for its current fiscal year.
   Church's stock dipped 25 cents to $7.75 a share Monday in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Church's, which has gone through several management changes and
poor sales over the past two years, had 1,500 restaurants before the
closures, second behind Kentucky Fried Chicken. Church's expects
sales this year of $520 million, down from $570 million in 1986 and
$633 million in 1984.
   Popeyes, the nation's third-largest chicken chain with about 725
restaurants, expects to have sales of $485 million this year.
   Church's board of directors has rejected Popeyes' offer as
inadequate and is challenging various aspects of it in federal court
as well as seeking possible other suitors.
   A federal judge in New Orleans earlier this month issued an order
preventing Popeyes from buying Church's stock until 10 working days
after Popeyes disclosed further information on its buyout offer.
   Popeyes' first takeover deadline was Nov. 30, but has been
extended to Friday. Popeyes Chairman Al Copeland says he already
owns 3.2 percent of Church's stock and says he has been tendered
14.6 million _ about 40.6 percent _ of Church's 35.9 million
outstanding shares under the $8 a share offer.

   A late round of selling pushed stock prices lower
Monday, wiping out a mild early bid to extend last week's rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up nearly 15 points at
its midday peak, closed with a 3.91 loss at 2,139.58. The average
rose 51.21 points last week.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
642 up, 770 down and 570 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 124.16 million
shares, down from 133.77 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 150.08 million shares.
   Analysts said stocks drew some early benefit from a rise in the
dollar against leading foreign currencies.
   But that upbeat theme seemed to be overridden by caution about
prospects for Federal Reserve policy and the pending monthly report
due out Wednesday on the nation's international trade balance.
   Brokers said it would be no surprise if Fed policymakers, meeting

   Advance estimates call for the October trade data to be about the

   Takeover news and rumors provided the day's few instances of
brisk activity.

<TEXT>
   Farley Inc. asked West Point-Pepperell Inc. on
Monday to call a special shareholder meeting to consider Farley's
$1.4 billion takeover bid, and Pepperell promptly indicated it would
review the shareholder vote calling for the meeting.
   Farley, a Chicago-based apparel manufacturer, had received
requests for a meeting from shareholders representing more than the
required 25 percent of Pepperell's shares, chairman William Farley
said in a statement.
   A Pepperell spokeswoman said the company had received the request
and had named the Corporation Trust Co. of Wilmington, Del., to
independently review the shareholders solicitations that had been
sent out and returned to Farley.
   A report on the meeting should be issued by Dec. 19, said the
spokeswoman, who asked that her name not be used.
   Pepperell stock on Monday rose 75 cents to close at $42.25 a
share in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Pepperell, which is based in West Point Ga., is the country's
largest publicly held textile manufacturer and makes Gold Toe socks,
Arrow shirts and Martex towels.
   Farley, maker of Fruit of the Loom underwear and several other
clothing brands, last Wednesday extended its $48-per-share buyout
bid through midnight EST Dec. 14. The company announced on Dec. 2
its intention to seek the special shareholder meeting.
   ``Our intention from the outset has been to sit down with
Pepperell's board and negotiate a mutually acceptable acquisition of
Pepperell,'' Farley said. ``But the board would not meet with us.''
   At the meeting, Farley would ask shareholders to replace the
board with nominees representing the Chicago company, Farley said.
   The new board would then dismantle defenses Pepperell has
arranged against takeovers, he said.
   Farley is seeking to overturn Pepperell's ``poison pill''
takeover defense plan in court. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals has scheduled a hearing on the matter in Atlanta for the
week of Jan. 9.

   The dollar strengthened marginally against major
foreign currencies Monday but exchange dealers said trading was
extremely slow, reflecting a reluctance to do business in advance of
the government's market-moving monthly trade report.
   Gold prices eased. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$420.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down from $422.50 late Friday.
   Currency strategists read little significance into the dollar's
small gain, saying it largely was due to internal market influences
of supply and demand, not any outside news.
   But some said speculation that the Federal Reserve would move to
tighten interest rates may have strengthened the dollar a bit.
Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more
attractive.
   Many dealers said the overwhelming force shaping the market's
behavior was reticence to take any risky positions before the
Commerce Department's report on the October trade deficit, due
Wednesday.
   The highly unpredictable monthly trade numbers are seen as one of
the most visible symbols of U.S. economic strength and
competitiveness abroad, with an enormous potential to influence
financial markets.
   A large trade deficit would likely depress the dollar's value,
while a small deficit would help stabilize or boost the currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.49 yen to close at 122.92 yen. Later
in London the dollar was quoted at 122.83 yen. By the time trading
ended in New York the dollar fetched 122.80 yen, up from 122.49 yen
late Friday.
   The British pound fell in London to $1.8418 from $1.8490 on
Friday. In New York, sterling fetched $1.8435, down from $1.8495
late Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates on
Friday, included: 1.7415 West German marks, up from 1.7352; 1.4643
Swiss francs, up from 1.4620; 1.1970 Canadian dollars, up from
evels late Friday
included: 1.7410 West German marks, up from 1.7330; 1.4650 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4605; 5.9520 French francs, up from 5.9240; 1.9635
Dutch guilders, up from 1.9560; 1,282.75 Italian lire, up from
1,280.25; and 1.1983 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1970.
   In bullion trading, gold for current delivery fell $2.80 a troy
ounce from late Friday's level to $420.10 on the New York Commodity
Exchange. Earlier in London gold fell $1 an ounce to $419.75. Gold
fell $1.05 an ounce in Zurich to $419.25 and fell $2.10 in Hong Kong
to $422.29.
   Silver bullion for current delivery fell 0.6 cent a troy ounce on
the New York Comex to $6.169. In London silver fell 2 cents an ounce
to $6.14.

   Unisys Corp. elected two new directors as
it and announced a reorganization of its management Monday in what
was described as part of a long-term strategy to ``sell solutions,
not machines.''
   Jan Lindelow, a senior vice president, will resign from the
company at the end of the year in connection with the management
shuffle. Lindelow's responsibilities would have been reduced and he
decided to look for another job, Unisys spokesman J. Peter Hynes
said.
   Hynes said the reduction of Lindelow's responsibilities was not a
reflection of his abilities.
   The computer company also extended its stock repurchase plan and
declared dividends at a board meeting Monday in Detroit.
   The chief financial officer of Unisys, Curtis A. Hessler, was
elected to the board of directors and promoted to executive vice
president.
   Paul C. Ely Jr., currently chairman of Convergent Inc., also was
elected to the board and will assume the position of executive vice
president with the completion of the Unisys acquisition of
Convergent, a maker of small but speedy computer workstations.
   Hynes said the acquisition of Convergent allowed the company to
reorganize its management and its engineering and manufacturing
divisions.
   Hynes said the company's long-term strategy focuses on three
areas: small computers, such as the Convergent machines; large,
traditional mainframe computers; and networking, which is the
process of allowing different computer systems to communicate with
each other.
   ``It's part of our overall strategy, which is selling solutions,
not machines,'' he said. ``We believe the customer does not care
about the machine as much as the customer cares about what the
machine will do for him,'' Hynes said.
   Under the new management, Hessler will be responsible for
implementing the company's financial and strategic plans. Ely will
become president of a newly formed Network Computing Group.
   Also under the new management, the current president of
Convergent, Cyril J. Yansouni, will be a Unisys corporate vice
president.
   A current Unisys executive vice president and director, James A.
Unruh, will be responsible for all commercial marketing operations.
He currently is in charge of international marketing operations and
the implementation of the annual financial plan.
   A Unisys senior vice president, Hollis L. Caswell, will become
president of a newly formed Computer Systems Group, responsible for
marketing the mainframe systems and peripheral products.
   The reorganization is expected to be implemented during the first
quarter of 1989, after Convergent shareholders vote on the
acquisition Dec. 22.
   In Detroit, the board declared a quarterly dividend of 25 cents
per common share and a 93.75 cent dividend on the company's Series A
cumulative convertible preferred stock.
   The board also extended for one year its periodic repurchase of
the company's common and preferred stock, which was implemented last
year.
   During 1988, the company purchased nearly 2 million of its
authorized 10 million shares and reissued about half to fund stock
option and other employee benefit plans.
   Unisys is a $10 billion manufacturer of commercial information
systems, defense systems and related services. It has more than
90,000 employees and 60,000 customers in more than 100 countries.

<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices fell steeply Monday on New York's Commodity
Exchange after the exchange reported the first increase in nearly a
month in deliverable supplies of the metal.
   On other markets, precious metals mostly were lower; livestock
and meat futures moved sharply higher; energy futures were mixed;
grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures fell.
   Copper settled 1 cent to 4.40 cents lower on the Commodity
Exchange with the spot contract for delivery in December at $1.585 a
pound and the more actively traded March contract at $1.352 a pound.
   Daily increases in the amount of warehoused copper registered
with the Commodity Exchange have been rare since October 1987, when
the Comex copper inventory stood at nearly 90,000 short tons.
   Late last week, the exchange reported that warehouse stocks had
dropped to 5,204 tons and copper for December delivery on the
exchange soared to an all-time high of $1.6475 a pound.
   But copper traders who had expected the trend to continue were
shocked Monday morning when the Comex reported that warehouse stocks
had risen to 6,545 tons, a 24 percent increase from last week's
tally.
   ``That was an unpleasant surprise to the market,'' said Craig
Sloane, metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New
York.
   The Comex last reported an increase in copper stocks on Nov. 17.
   Meanwhile, the world's other major copper futures market, the
London Metal Exchange, reported a 1,925-ton decline in its warehouse
stocks of copper, which was a smaller decrease than traders had
expected, Sloane said.
   Platinum futures prices fell sharply in a technically inspired
sell-off, dragging a gold prices lower as well, but silver futures
were mixed, analysts said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $8.60 to
$11.10 lower with January at $589.10 a troy ounce. On the Comex,
gold settled $2.80 to $3.10 lower with February at $424.60 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.7 cent lower to 0.4 cent higher with March at
$6.298 a troy ounce.
   Pork futures rose strongly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
speculation that last week's drop in slaughters meant hog kills had
passed their seasonal peak, said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with
Agri-Visor Services Inc., Bloomington, Ill.
   Strong retail demand and the arrival of wintry conditions in the
Midwest also contributed to the advance in pork futures, he said.
   ``Farmers just havent' been willing to move hogs with the kind of
temperatures we've had because it stresses them a little more,''
Durchholz said.
   Cattle futures rallied in sympathy with the pork complex and in
reaction to renewed demand, he said.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent to .60 cent higher with December at
72.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to 1 cent higher
with January at 83.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .63 cent to 1.20
cents higher with December at 42.77 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.03 cent to 1.35 cent higher with February at 44.60
cents a pound.
   Home heating oil prices closed sharply higher and lent support to
crude oil futures after sub-zero temperatures hit the Northeast,
analysts said. Gasoline futures retreated.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents 22 cents higher
with January at $16.06 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .70
cent higher with January at 50.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .11 cent to .40 cent lower with January at 44.20 cents a gallon.
   Grain futures finished higher on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
rumors of impending grain sales to the Soviet Union while soybean
prices settled mostly lower in response to weekend rains in South
America.
   The Agriculture Department issued a monthly grain supply-demand
report after the close in which it increased its estimate for the
U.S. wheat stockpile at the end of the current marketing year to 533
million bushels from 528 million bushels.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with December at $4.28{
a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 4} cents higher with December at
$2.61{ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 5{ cents higher with December
at $2.07{ a bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents lower to 4} cents higher
with January at $7.69\ a bushel.
   Stock index futures fell moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled 1.15 points lower at 279.30. Each point is worth
$500.

   The Disney-held company seeking to acquire Polaroid
Corp. amended its takeover offer Monday to meet a federal court
order that was blocking the bid.
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. said its hostile $42-a-share bid for
Polaroid was now contingent on whether a judge in Delaware
invalidated or rescinded the Polaroid employee stock ownership plan
being challenged by Shamrock.
   Analysts said the move would not dramatically alter Shamrock's
$2.6 billion tender offer, which has been in abeyance pending court
action.
   In Delaware, U.S. District Judge Caleb Wright on Monday ordered
Shamrock to modify the language of the offer and issue a news
release on the changes. The Burbank, Calif.-based television
concern, wholly owned by the Roy E. Disney family, met the
conditions immediately.
   Shamrock said it would purchase Polaroid shares under its $42
offer only if the employee stock plan was invalidated by Delaware
Chancery Court, where Shamrock is challenging the plan.
   Previously, Shamrock had maintained that the deal could have
proceeded merely if the 10 million shares in the stock plan were
ruled not part of the company's outstanding shares.
   If the $300 million plan is invalidated, Shamrock would try to
buy 62 million outstanding shares. If not, it would be faced with
acquiring about 72 million shares under an earlier $40-a-share
offer, analysts said.
   Shamrock owns 5 million shares of Polaroid.
   Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said the company had no
comment on the development.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia last month
ordered the district court to issue a preliminary injunction
blocking the takeover bid until Shamrock clarified its position on
the employee stock plan.
   The plan places 14 percent of the company stock in employee
hands, a move Shamrock claims was designed intentionally to defend
against its hostile takeover bid. Under Delaware law, a hostile
bidder must acquire at least 85 percent of a company.
   Cambridge-based Polaroid, which introduced instant snapshots in
1948, is incorporated in Delaware.
   ``I don't think this implies a change in the approach of Shamrock
to the offer or really any material change in the offer,'' said Alex
Henderson, an analyst with Prudential Bache Securities.
   Arguments in the chancery court case are scheduled for Friday.
Shamrock said it would extend its offer for Polaroid past next
Monday's expiration date to wait for a court ruling.

<HEAD>Japanese Investment Firm Buys 20 Percent Stake in Blackstone Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nikko Securities Co. Ltd., a Japanese investment
giant, has acquired a 20 percent stake in a holding partnership
formed by The Blackstone Group, a rapidly-growing investment banking
firm, the two concerns said Monday.
   The deal formalizes a business relationship that began when Nikko
invested $100 million in a Blackstone buyout fund last year. It
gives Blackstone an infusion of capital and better access to the
Japanese capital markets.
   It is the latest in a series of alliances that has seen Japanese
investment firms buy stakes in the relatively smaller Wall Street
investment boutiques that are becoming an increasingly potent force
in the mergers and acquisitions arena.
   Last summer, Nomura Securities Co. bought a 20 percent stake in
the buyout firm Wasserstein, Perella & Co., and Yamaichi Securities
Co. agreed to buy a 25 percent equity interest in another small
buyout firm, Lodestar Group.
   Tokyo-based Nikko Securities said it would pay $100 million for
the interest in the Blackstone holding partnership.
   In exchange, it will be allowed to participate in 20 percent of
the profits generated by Blackstone's financial advisory activities
and its investment banking affiliates, such as Blackstone Financial
Management which oversees investments in two mutual funds.
   The agreement ``formalizes a basis for close cooperation on
U.S.-Japan M&A transactions between the two firms,'' the statement
said.
   Blackstone was founded three years ago and is headed by Peter G.
Peterson, the former U.S. Commerce secretary and onetime chairman of
Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. which has become part of Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. Among its six general partners is David Stockman,
the former director of the Office of Management and Budget under
President Reagan.
   In October 1987, Nikko paid $100 million to become one of three
limited partner-investors in Blackstone Capital Partners,
Blackstone's buyout fund that currently has more than $750 million
of equity capital.
   The fund's biggest deals to date include the $2.6 billion buyout
of Wickes Co. and its $600 million purchase of 51 percent of USX
Corp.'s transportation subsidiaries which it operates in partnership
with USX.
   Blackstone also has advised on merger and aquisition deals valued
at more than $15 billion, including Sony Corp.'s $2 billion purchase
of CBS Records and the acquisition of Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. by
Japan's Bridgestone Corp.
   ``We have been pleased and impressed with Blackstone's
performance and basic philosophy,'' said Yasuo Kanzaki, executive
vice president of Nikko Securities.
   He said Nikko and the ``vast majority of Japanese corporations
share Blackstone's strictly friendly philosophy in both its advisory
and principal actvities.''
   Nikko Securities is one of the biggest Japanese investment houses
with $4.7 billion in capital as of September 1988.
   Peterson, who is chairman of Blackstone Group, and Stephen A.
Schwarzman, president, said in a joint statement that the investment
by Nikko would help Blackstone finance its diversification plans
into areas such as the restructuring of troubled companies, obtain
better access to the Japanese capital markets and provide better
service to its existing clients.
   ``Finally it provides all these benefits while permitting us the
freedom to continue to operate out business in the way we have,''
the statement said.

<HEAD>Group of Eight Meet to Discuss Latin American Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic and finance ministers from
seven Latin American nations agreed Monday to take ``urgent'',
collective measures to reduce their foreign debt.
   The so-called Group of Eight also agreed in a closed-door meeting
to present the measures, which were undisclosed, to their respective
presidents.
   The group is composed of ministers from Argentina, Brazil,
Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela and Mexico. Panama dropped out of
the group last year due to internal political turmoil. Together, the
eight member countries owe around $400 billion in foreign debt along
with $25 billion in interest due in 1989.
   The measures should be accompanied by a call for cut in interst
rates below the market rate, according to Brazilian Finance Minister
Mailson da Nobrega.
   In the six years since the world debt crisis erupted, this is the
first time that debtor nations have proposed an apparently
unconventional, collective answer to the debt question, some
observers said. At past meetings some members have stressed that
each country's particular characteristics make a case-by-case direct
resolution of their respective debts with creditors the more
appropriate path to follow.
   During the Rio meeting, as in past years, the Group of Eight
avoided talk of a debt cartel.

<HEAD>Chevron Announces $100 Million Loss on Irving Oil Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. announced Monday it will post
a loss in excess of $100 million after taxes in the fourth quarter
on the sale of its 48.9 percent stake in Irving Oil Ltd.
   But a spokesman for the oil giant said the charge should not
result in a net loss for the quarter.
   Chevron said it sold its interest in Irving Oil on Friday after
having an interest in the firm for more than 30 years, said Steve
McLennan, manager of investor relations for Chevron.
   Chevron would not disclose the details of the transaction. Irving
Oil is a privately-held company based in New Brunswick, Canada, that
operates a refinery and has a number of marketing outlets.
   Chevron officials denied that the sale, which had been negotiated
``for some time,'' was prompted by anything in particular.
   ``It's been a profitable enterprise for us,'' he said. ``The
charge we're taking in the fourth quarter is, in a sense, undoing a
little bit of the profits of the past. Overall, it's been a
profitable investment.''
   McLennan said it ``was in neither one of our interests'' to
continue the minority interest. The two companies have some ``very,
very small'' joint operations that will continue under contract, he
added.
   ``Although it is a substantial loss to take, it should not put us
in the red for the quarter,'' said McLennan. ``It shouldn't really
even come close.''
   Chevron had net income of $220 million, or 64 cents a share, in
the foureth quarter a year ago after taking a charge of $93 million
related to the disposition and write-off of assets.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chevron rose 12{ cents
a share to $46 on Monday.

<HEAD>Lucas Sues over `Templates of Doom'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of the film ``Indiana Jones and
the Temple of Doom'' has brought a copyright infringement suit
against a computer software company for its ``Templates of Doom''
product.
   The U.S. District Court suit by Lucasfilm Inc., filed last
Friday, claims the program, marketed by Solar Systems Software,
violates filmmaker George Lucas' copyright in his Indiana Jones
films and spinoff products.
   Peter Antoniak of San Bruno, Calif., identified in the suit as
owner of Solar Systems Software, did not return a telephone call
Monday.
   Jones, an archeologist and adventurer played by Harrison Ford,
was the central character in Lucas' ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.'' A third film, ``Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade,'' is due in May 1989, the suit said.
   It said Lucasfilm has trademarked the ``Temple of Doom'' name and
design and used it to sell products that include puzzles, books,
comics, video games, lapel buttons, kites, slumberbags, T-shirts and
children's pajamas.
   The ``Templates of Doom'' program is sold in a package that
pictures a character resembling Indiana Jones, wearing a snap-brim
fedora, leather jacket and shoulder bag, the suit said.
   The program is used to teach people how to use financial
spreadsheet programs, said Neil Shapiro, a lawyer for Lucasfilm.
   The suit seeks $50,000 for each copyright infringement, plus
damages equal to three times the profits from the product, and a
court order prohibiting future infringements.
   Shapiro said Lucasfilm has asked Antoniak several times over a
period of months to stop his marketing, without success.
   ``This is not a lawsuit we wanted to bring,'' Shapiro said. ``But
one cannot let one's trademark be used freely by others over a
period of time or one eventually loses the trademark.''
