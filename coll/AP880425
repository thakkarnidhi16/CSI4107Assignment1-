<HEAD>Tobacco Companies Seek Another Mistrial Following Key Ruling</HEAD>

   Three tobacco companies in a cigarette
liability suit will ask again for a mistrial following a judge's
opinion that narrowed the claims against them, lawyers said Monday.
   Lawyers for Philip Morris Co., Liggett Group Inc. and Lorillard
Inc. will file papers this week for a mistrial in U.S. District
Judge H. Lee Sarokin's ruling last Thursday, said Steven C.
Parrish, a lawyer for Morris and Lorillard.
   The companies have sought at least four mistrials since court
proceedings began Feb. 1 and twice have sought to have Sarokin
removed from the case. All those efforts were unsuccessful.
   Sarokin last week dismissed charges brought by Antonio Cipollone
on behalf of his wife, Rose, who died of lung cancer at age 58 in
1984 after four decades of smoking the defendants' cigarettes.
Cipollone had charged that the companies caused his wife's death by
failing to market a safer product or do enough research on smoking.
   Although the judge ruled there was not enough evidence to
support the claims, he decided that the evidence could lead to a
finding that the companies engaged in conspiracy to cover up the
dangers of smoking.
   The companies say the jury could not decide fairly on the
remaining contentions because so much evidence on the safer
cigarette and research issues has been introduced.
   Sarokin also let stand allegations that Liggett failed to warn
Mrs. Cipollone about the dangers of cigarettes, but threw out the
charge against Morris and Lorillard because she did not smoke their
cigarettes after 1966, when Congress mandated warnings on cigarette
packs.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-seven union members began a
fast Monday as part of the two-month-old strike by thousands of
construction workers demanding that the government grant wage
increases and better working conditions.
   About 4,500 construction workers belonging to four opposition
labor groups have been on strike since Feb. 25.
   The 27 hunger strikers began their fast at the General Workers
Confederation headquarters in Managua.
   Carlos Nunez, president of the National Assembly and the
Sandinista government's representative in talks with domestic
opposition groups, called plans for the hunger strike ``a political
publicity show.''
   The construction workers went on strike after the leftist
government decreed new wage scales and raised prices for basic
staples on Feb. 14 as part of reforms intended to combat inflation,
which reached 1,500 percent last year.
   Government officials have called the strike illegal, and Labor
Minister Benedicto Meneses said only 600 workers have walked off
their jobs.
   Monday night, the Labor Ministry said negotiations with the
strikers had been suspended. A statement said the unions were
seeking ``to return to former payment systems that were eliminated
precisely because they ran against the logic of the economic reform
measures.''
   It called on the strikers to return to work ``with the guarantee
they won't be the object of any reprisals.''
   The strike was called by the General Independent Workers
Confederation, the Autonomous Workers Central of Nicaragua, the
Confederation of Trade Union Unity and the Labor Action and Unity
Central. They claim a membership of 100,000.
   There was no immediate response from the government to President
Reagan's message to Congress Monday in which he threatened to
expand the U.S. embargo against Nicaragua.
   But on Sunday, President Daniel Ortega said that if the embargo
continued, the Sandinistas would prohibit further shipments from
the United States of equipment and other assistance to Nicaraguan
organizations.
   The embargo had been set to expire April 30. It permits U.S. aid
and independent donations of supplies to ``democratic
organizations,'' including newsprint and equipment for the
opposition newspaper La Prensa.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for rock singer Mick Jagger
said Monday that there was only the ``barest, scintilla of
evidence'' that Jagger ever heard a song he is accused of pirating
in his 1985 hit ``Just Another Night.''
   A federal court jury got the case Monday and deliberated 3{
hours before retiring for the evening.
   The jury listened to several tapes and reviewed Jagger's travel
schedule for early 1983, when reggae musician Patrick Alley's song
was broadcast in the New York area. Testimony showed Jagger was in
the area for five days in January and February of that year.
   Alley is suing Jagger, maintaining that Jagger infringed on his
copyright of a song with the same name.
   Two alternate jurors, who were dismissed at start of
deliberations, said it seemed to them that Jagger had developed his
song independently.
   Peter Parcher, one of Jagger's lawyers, said the only similarity
between Jagger's song and Alley's 1979 song were the title and the
theme of a man spending one more night with a woman, which is
``certainly not original.''
   Parcher said there was only the ``barest, barest, scintilla of
evidence'' that Jagger ever heard Alley's song and added that his
client had ``no motive to steal Patrick Alley's song.''
   Alley's attorney, Thomas Farley, said Alley and Jagger had
several mutual friends and acquaintances, and said the songs'
similar choruses were ``the certain spark that made the songs
memorable.''
   If the jury decides Jagger infringed upon Alley's copyright,
damages would be decided in a second trial unless a settlement were
reached.
   Alley's lawyers say Jagger netted as much as $6 million from the
song.

   A moderate earthquake occurred Monday in the
Gulf of Alaska, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
   The tremor was centered about 350 miles southeast of Anchorage
and occurred at 5:48 p.m. local time (9:48 p.m EDT.)
   USGS earthquake monitors in Golden, Colo., said they recorded
the tremor at a preliminary magnitude of 5.6 on the Richter scale.
It was reported felt strongly in Yakataga.
   There was no immediate word of any damage or injuries.
   The Richter scale is an open-ended gauge of energy released by
an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake with a magnitude of 5 can cause considerable damage in a
populated area.

   Elaine's, whose clubby confines have provided
refuge for a generation of creative minds and famous faces,
celebrated its first quarter-century Monday with a celebrity bash.
   Elaine Kaufman, the rotund proprietress who rewards loyalty and
fame with choice tables, expected her ``nice, neighborhood
restaurant'' to be filled with people whose names have filled
gossip columns for years.
   For the party, the checked-cloth-covered tables were removed,
the ceiling was filled with balloons, and rotating spotlights were
set up outside.
   A crowd of onlookers watched as celebrities filed by: George
Segal, Sidney Lumet, Pat Kennedy Lawford, Peter Maas, Eli Wallach,
Iman, Connie Chung, Raquel Welch, Billy Dee Williams, Cheryl Tiegs,
Halston, Terry Southern, Jerzy Kosinski.
   ``The Eighth Avenue subway at rush hour is a picnic compared to
this,'' said Jackie Mason in the jam-packed interior.
   ``These people are used to being treated like kings here.
Tonight they are treated like cockroaches.''
   And this was early by Elaine's standards: 10 p.m.
   ``This place is a living People magazine,'' said bartender Brian
McDonald.
   But a glitzy night of revelry is hardly what the regulars think
of when they think of Elaine's.
   A comfortable tavern chockablock with posters, photos and book
covers donated by its celebrated clientele, Elaine's has evolved
from a writer's and artists' hangout to a required stop in the
city's see-and-be-seen circuit.
   Saturday night was typical: Woody Allen, Albert Finney and
Paloma Picasso, among others. Prince was there a couple of weeks
ago.
   Allen opened his cinematic valentine to New York, ``Manhattan,''
with a scene set in Elaine's. He's a regular, Elaine said, because
``He loves to people-watch. It's comfortable, nobody bothers him,
we make him what he wants.''
   The food, critics love to point out, is undistinguished. It's
the restaurant ``where you get the least for your money,''
according to the Zagat Restaurant Survey.
   And its reputation, deserved or not, is that service can be rude
and inattentive if you've never made the best-seller list. Even
writer George Plimpton, among the most loyal of regulars, said,
``I'm afraid you don't get treated very well if you don't have a
pencil in your top pocket.''
   Nevertheless, it usually fills up by 9 p.m. with stars,
stargazers, yuppies and just neighborhood folks. Those at the bar
can nurse $3.50 beers and watch the scene.
   In a city where formality sometimes chokes the fun out of a
meal, Elaine's is a relaxing, familiar retreat, its regulars say.
   ``It offers an ambience of camaraderie that is centered on
Elaine herself _ she's the den mother there,'' said author Gay
Talese, adding: ``It's like a boarding house, you've got the round
table, and you don't need a reservation, if you're a friend of
hers.''
   If you're not, you'll sit farther back.
   Detractors and celebrity-watchers alike make too big a deal out
of the place, Elaine said.
   ``I think a lot of people just come in to have dinner,'' she
said. ``And you have a good time. A good bottle of wine, a nice
plate of pasta _ I mean, that's life.''
   When she plunked down $10,000 for the bar in 1963, she already
knew some show folk, writers and artists from her days as a
waitress and cafe manager in Greenwich Village.
   ``Actually, what I did was just bring the Village uptown,'' she
said.
   ``Then, it was barely going, a rather sleepy place up there,''
Plimpton recalled. ``Friends got their friends to go. It was just
one room, very quiet, and we would play darts.
   ``Elaine made sure it was a very informal, non-frantic
atmosphere. Now it's a bit different, and more expensive.''
   Overall, however, it's much the same as it was 25 years ago,
said Elaine. Regulars can count on a good table, and count on her
being there.
   ``I'm not changing it all the time,'' she said. ``I'm not going
with the current trend.''

   A group of Panamanian dissidents is planning
to undertake a military operation against strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega by the beginning of next week, an opposition leader said
Monday.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has maintained his loyalty to
ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, told reporters the group is
made up of very knowledgeable officers who have many friends in the
Panamanian Defense Forces, or PDF.
   Sosa gave no details, but the group apparently is comprised of
high-ranking defectors from the Defense Forces who came to the
United States shortly after Panama's crisis erupted two months ago
with Delvalle's ouster.
   One is Air Force Lt. Col. Augusto Villalaz, who has been living
in exile in Washington for the past five weeks. He claimed that he
and other Defense Force pilots flew more than 90,000 pounds of
weapons from Cuba to Panama before he defected.
   Sosa, who has refused to relinquish the embassy to a replacement
envoy appointed by the new government in Panama, said the dissident
group has set up a ``military command'' and has ``intimate
knowledge'' of the Defense Forces.
   ``We are very confident that the military actions will have the
help, the support of people within the PDF,'' Sosa said. ``This is
an asset we never had before.''
   A military coup attempt against Noriega last month was put down
quickly.
   Asked why he was disclosing a planned military operation at a
news conference, Sosa said Noriega is aware that his opponents will
not give up the struggle against him. He indicated that he did not
believe that the disclosure would hurt the chances for the success
of the plan.
   Sosa said the plan is being worked out on the assumption that no
assistance from the United States or other outside countries will
be necessary.
   U.S. officials have said for weeks that opposition to Noriega in
the Defense Forces has been growing but that the dissident elements
have been unable to agree on a plan for his ouster.
   The Reagan administration has imposed a series of economic and
diplomatic sanctions against Panama over the past two months, and
officials have become increasingly frustrated over Noriega's
ability to survive these pressures.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified Reagan administration
official as saying that U.S. economic sanctions against Panama
would be relaxed ``within a week or so.''
   The official said the Treasury Department was considering a list
of possible exemptions, including payment of utility bills and
``normal administrative fees and costs'' such as gasoline excise
taxes, rental fees and airline landing fees, The Times reported in
its Tuesday editions.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug
smuggling charges.
   Some in the administration favor a U.S. military move against
Panama but several proposals which have been passed on to the
Pentagon have been given a hostile reception.
   Sosa said that among the seven new cabinet officers appointed on
Sunday by Delvalle's successor, President Manuel Solis Palma, were
several with pro-Cuban leanings.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
United States does not view the Solis Palma government as
legitimate, and she therefore declined comment on the reshuffling.
   Asked about the shutoff Sunday of electricity to a U.S. Embassy
annex in Panama, Mrs. Oakley said the State Department does not
believe embassy operations will be affected.
   The electricity to the annex and to the apartments of at least
45 embassy workers was cut off because of non-payment of bills.
   As part of an attempt to deprive Panamanian authorities of cash,
the administration has ordered a ban on all payments to the
government by U.S. citizens and organizations.

<HEAD>Ficus Trees Growing Wild In South Florida</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ficus tree, long considered sterile, now has a
way to reproduce on its own, and scientists in South Florida are
bracing for an explosion of the lush, iron-rooted titan of the
tropics.
   The ficus benjamina, or weeping fig, may be a finicky house
plant, but it grows very large very fast in hospitable climates.
Its dense crown snuff out plants below, and its notorious roots can
muscle through pavement to strangle other large trees and choke
pipes.
   Ficus had been held in check by their inability to reproduce _
until now.
   Tiny insects from India and tropical regions have found their
way to Florida and are allowing the trees to pollinate the wild
seeds, which are spread by birds and animals that eat the small
berries.
   A single tree can produce millions of seeds a year.
   ``You get the idea it's just a rain of these things coming down
all the time,'' said Doyle McKey, tropical biologist at the
University of Miami, where ficus have been seen sprouting on stone
walls and sidewalk cracks.
   Until such insects as the female fig wasp came to Florida, ficus
could only be reproduced in plant nurseries from other cuttings.
That meant the spread of ficus was limited to where property owners
planted them.
   Most of the wild seedlings spotted so far are small, but the
growth has been widespread. They have been seen dotting lawns and
forests throughout South Florida and north to the Tampa Bay area.
   ``I think we're going to see our landscape change,'' said Robert
Knight Jr., a researcher at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
subtropical research station in Coral Gables.
   It's too soon to tell whether they'll be mostly a suburban
nuisance or begin to crowd out native vegetation in unspoiled
areas, scientists say.
   ``They might become a pest in our nature preserves and
hammocks,'' McKey said recently. ``Otherwise, the habitat is going
to be in suburbia in our landscapes, where everything else is
unnatural.''

<TEXT>
   President Najib says his communist
government wants better relations with the United States and would
even consider accepting military aid from a nation now supporting
thousands of Afghan rebels.
   Najib also confirmed on Sunday that guerrillas fighting his
Soviet-backed government had captured a garrison near the Pakistan
border after a four-month siege. The guerrillas said the victory
opened a new, direct supply route for weapons into Afghanistan.
   In a speech to a visiting Soviet delegation and a group of
private American citizens, Najib said the United States must stop
providing military aid to Pakistan if it wants the Soviet Union to
stop arming Afghanistan.
   Najib's demand appeared more rhetorical than practical. His
army's vulnerability to attacks by Pakistani-based Afghan
guerrillas would become even more pronounced if Kabul lost Moscow's
backing.
   Expounding on a ``formula of symmetry,'' Najib suggested Soviet
aid to his government continue at the same level as U.S. assistance
to Pakistan.
   If ``there must be a cutoff of aid for the Afghan government,
there must be a cutoff of all American aid to the Pakistani
government,'' Najib told the two groups at the end of a week-long
conference on Afghanistan.
   The Soviet Union has agreed to start withdrawing its estimated
115,000 troops from Afghanistan on May 15 under a U.N.-mediated
agreement signed April 14 in Geneva by the United States, the
Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   The United States, China and several other countries have been
aiding the Afghan guerrillas via Pakistan. The Soviet Union arms
the Afghan military forces. Each superpower has reseved the right
to continue its assistance as long as the other one does.
   Throughout his address to the American and Soviet delegations,
Najib stressed his government's friendship with the Soviet Union,
which shares a 1,400-mile border with this central Asian nation.
   But he said repeatedly that his government sought friendlier
ties _ and specifically private investment _ from the United States.
   Talking later with reporters, he said: ``We would like good
relations, politically, economically, culturally with the United
States of America, even including military aid to our country to
defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity.''
   Guerrilla leaders in Pakistan said Saturday their fighters
captured Barikot, base of the Afghan army's 55th brigade, on
Friday. The garrison is in Afghanistan's northeast Kunar province.
   Najib confirmed that government troops evacuated the garrison
but described the incident as ``a hange of position'' rather than a
defeat.
   Later Sunday, Najib attended a ceremony marking Afghanistan's
April 27 communist revolution and reiterated his call for
reconciliation with the rebels.
   ``Now more than any other time, we are hopeful for peace and
national reconciliation,'' he was quoted as saying by Radio Kabul.
   For the guerrillas, the capture of Barikot would open a major
weapons supply route from Pakistan's border town of Arando to
Afghanistan's northeastern province of Nuristan and Kunar.
   The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the Geneva accord,
have vowed to continue fighting until Najib's government is
overthrown. The Soviets intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979.
   The Afghan president, whose robust, fleshy build gives him the
appearance of a football player gone slightly to seed, flashed
broad smiles and gestured expansively as he met the Soviet and
American groups for two hours at Arg Palace in the heart of Kabul.
   Throughout his speech, Najib, who replaced another Soviet-backed
Afghan leader in 1986, denounced the United States for supplying
the guerrillas with high-powered Stinger missiles.
   The Afghan government repeatedly has accused the rebels of using
Stingers against civilian Afghan aircraft.
   The head of the American delegation, former U.S. ambassador to
El Salvador Robert E. White, defended the United States.
   ``It was not the United States that introduced high-tech weapons
into Afghanistan,'' said White, who is now president of the
non-government International Center for Development Policy in
Washington.
   ``Stingers ... are terrible weapons, but their objectives are to
destroy machines of war that have rained death and destruction on
Afghanistan,'' White said.

   The visit last week of New York Cardinal John
O'Connor to Cuba marked the latest in a series of moves indicating
greater government acceptance of religion in this communist nation.
   Thousands of worshipers filled cathedrals in Havana and
Santiago, Cuba, for Masses celebrated by the Roman Catholic
cardinal during his four-day visit.
   One woman, Ruby Jane Padron, said her husband, Alberto, had been
imprisoned 22 years simply for being a practicing Catholic.
   But when asked if she was afraid to be at the Mass in Havana,
she said: ``Nervous? No, we are not nervous here. No, that was in
the past. It's different now. The hands of the communists are
easier _ not so harsh.''
   Cuban leader Fidel Castro met with O'Connor on Wednesday night
and, according to the cardinal, agreed to grant more visas for
foreign nuns to come to Cuba.
   Last month, Cuba authorized 19 foreign priests and an expatriate
Cuban clergyman to work in Cuba, along with the 210 priests already
in the communist nation.
   Last year, the government allowed importation of 30,000 Bibles.
And in 1986, the leadership called on citizens to respect the
beliefs of churchgoers.
   Cuba now has an office of religious affairs, and Castro has made
no secret of the fact that he would welcome a visit by the pope.
   There apparently is more than one reason for this relaxation.
   The number of Roman Catholics has decreased to an acceptable
level, by government standards.
   When Castro siezed power in 1959 about 85 percent of Cubans were
Roman Catholics. Now Roman Catholics make up an estimated 41
percent of Cuba's 10.2 million people.
   In addition, the government has realized that it's possible to
be loyal both to the church and to the revolution.
   ``Theoretically it is possible, and in reality it also is,''
Education Minister Jose Ramon Fernandez told reporters while
touring Havana's historical colonial section with O'Connor.
   Even O'Connor told reporters, ``All of us in the United States
would be revolutionaries, I guess. We are the product of a
revolution. I've never thought of myself as a bad Catholic for that
reason.''
   Cuba's treatment of religion began changing around 1985 after
the publication of the book ``Fidel and Religion,'' by the Rev.
Carlos Alberto Christo, a Brazilian priest.
   Castro told Christo he never opposed the Catholic Chuch as an
institution _ only those ``militant Catholics ... from the rich
class that supported the counterrevolution.''
   He described as ``models for Communists'' the Catholic nuns who
work in Cuban hospitals and mental asylums.
   O'Connor said he drummed the idea of the church's
resourcefulness into Castro during their talk, and Castro responded
eagerly.
   Castro welcomed the idea of having an American clergyman as a
liaison between the U.S. government and Cuban political prisoners
in an attempt to get the United States to accept the prisoners, the
cardinal said.
   The two also discussed the possibility of church assistance in
helping Cuba obtain medical supplies unavailable on the island
nation.
   Closer church-state relations and especially a papal visit would
boost Cuba's image abroad.
   ``The church could be very very helpful in explaining to the
world at large what is legitimate in the revolutionary government
here in Cuba,'' O'Connor said.
   Government officials turned out in force to greet O'Connor, and
the cardinal indicated the Vatican would pay close attention to
this in deciding whether Cuba should be added to the pope's future
itinerary.
   The reaction in churches and on the street to O'Connor's
presence gave credence to the cardinal's comment that the faith in
Cuba is still solid, despite years of restrictions.
   One elderly woman clutching rosary beads rushed up to pastor
James McCarthy, O'Connor's secretary, as he walked through the
streets of Old Havana and told him what a wonderful thing the
cardinal's visit was.
   ``No political system, no ideology, is going to be ultimately
successful in driving (the faith) out,'' O'Connor said. ``Success
could be achieved for a period of time, but the seed is there, and
it keeps springing back into flower.''

political debate have bared some of the darkest and most sensitive
moments of Italy's fascist past.
   The treatment of Jews, the conduct of Italy's Communist Party
and the plight of Italian soldiers left to choose sides between the
Nazis and the Allies all have come under scrutiny.
   Some of the issues are being used as fuel in current political
maneuvering, particularly in the struggle between the Communists
and the Socialists for dominance of the Italian left.
   Others have surfaced as Italy's Jewish community prepares to
mark the 50th anniversary of the racial laws enacted by Benito
Mussolini's fascist dictatorship, which foreshadowed deportations
to Nazi death camps.
   The controversy involving the alleged complicity in war crimes
of President Kurt Waldheim in neighboring Austria brought a
reminder that Italian as well as Nazi troops were occupying the
Balkans.
   The probing has touched some raw nerves.
   When Renzo De Felice, a leading historian who wrote a highly
respected biography of Mussolini, lectured at Rome University, he
was heckled and harassed by leftist students.
   De Felice recently suggested anti-fascism was mainly serving the
Communist Party and should be abandoned. But other books praise
Italians who fought fascism.
   ``We all looked at ourselves as anti-fascist and on the side of
the Allies,'' says Furio Colombo, the president of Fiat U.S.A. and
a Columbia University lecturer who wrote the preface to the Italian
edition of American historian Susan Zuccotti's book ``The Italians
and the Holocaust.''
   The book, published here in March by Mondadori, gives generally
high marks to Italians, noting that Italy shares with Denmark the
merit of the highest percentage of Jews saved. But it also makes
the point that Italians bear a share of guilt.
   More than 8,000 Jews were deported and only about 900 of them
survived.
   ``It shouldn't be possible any longer to boast of the `minimum
number' of Italian Jews put to death,'' said Colombo in his
preface. ``Only one Italian Jew persecuted (and there were
thousands) would already represent a crime serious enough to force
a collective rethinking of the past.''
   Any confusion about Italians coming to terms with the past can
perhaps be attributed in part to the shifting loyalties that
evolved as Italy became bogged down in World War II, leaving the
country in a ``no man's land'' between winners and losers at the
end.
   Mussolini came to power in 1922, launched an invasion of
Ethiopia in 1936 and took Italy into World War II on the side of
Nazi Germany and Japan.
   He was ousted from power in Rome in July 1943 after Allied
forces landed in Sicily. In September 1943, Italy surrendered
unconditionally to the Allies.
   In the meantime, the Germans helped Mussolini escape from prison
and established him in a puppet regime in the north. Italian
partisans captured Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci, on
April 27, 1945, shot them and hung their bodies upside down at a
gasoline station near Milan.
   One of the bitterest quarrels to emerge has pitted Communist and
Socialist Party officials over whether Palmiro Togliatti, who led
the Communists from 1927 until his death in 1964, had abandoned the
party's founder, Antonio Gramsci, to fascist prison.
   The allegations center over whether Togliatti, from his exile in
Moscow, had not tried to press the Soviet Union to negotiate the
freedom of Gramsci, known more as a liberal thinker than the party
boss.
   ``Togliatti was neither a saint nor a hero,'' said former
Socialist Premier Bettino Craxi, drawing the rage of the Communist
leadership.
   Historian De Felice's point is that Italy is ill-served by a
continued use of anti-fascism as a political reference point, as if
anti-fascist meant democratic.
   ``I don't say you have to forget fascism,'' De Felice said in an
interview with The Associated Press. ``I say that today, that the
use of the label anti-fascism has allowed the Communists to present
themselves as the other parties. It has given them a common
heritage.''
   De Felice also contends that the postwar laws forbidding
re-establishment of the Fascist Party are anachronistic, since
there is a neo-fascist party, the Italian Social Movement, which
has consistently gathered around 6 percent of the vote.
   The historian also told Milan's Corriere della Sera that the
``myth'' of fascism is over, noting that Mussolini's granddaughter,
a budding actress, recently posed topless in an Italian men's
magazine.
   Others disagree that it's time to move on.
   Colombo, for example, said that while he may agree with De
Felice intellectually ``some signal still has to be given'' about
the evils of fascism.
   The Jewish community of about 40,000 plans major commemorations
this fall of the enactment of the racial laws that expelled Jews
from government positions and the military and put restrictions on
their work, schooling and possession of property.
   ``It's too soon to say let bygones be bygones,'' said Tullia
Zevi, president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities.
   Jewish leaders note that until 1938 the Jewish community was
fully integrated in Italian society, holding important posts in the
military and government and even the Fascist Party.
   Another a point of controversy is whether Pope Pius XII did all
he could to save the Jews. The Zuccotti book praises the efforts of
individual priests to protect Italian Jews.
   The Vatican, which has repeatedly defended the efforts of the
pope, on April 13 ran excerpts in its daily newspaper from a new
book by a German historian contesting allegations against Pius XII.
The newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, called it a ``vibrant and
direct response to the denigrators of the pontiff.''

   The first golf course is being built in the Soviet
Union.
   As a group of Swedish diplomats and area residents looked on
Saturday, a bulldozer began work on the course near the Swedish
Embassy in Moscow.
   The project is a joint venture of the Moscow Sport Committee and
a group of Swedish companies and will be finished in the fall, the
news agency Tass said.
   The course apparently will be off limits initially to most
Soviets, to whom the sport is alien. Tass said embassy workers and
foreign businessmen in Moscow will use the course and that a golf
school will be built for Moscow children.

   ABC's ``Nightline'' tonight begins a week of
shows live from Israel, including a three-hour panel discussion in
Jerusalem before an audience of 700 Israelis and Palestinians.
   ``Good Lord only knows'' how the live discussion will turn out,
said ``Nightline'' anchor Ted Koppel, who has done shows in
previous years from South Africa, the Philippines and Southeast
Asia.
   ``This just seemed like one of those subjects that is so rich
and meaty it really can't be covered in an hour or two over here,
so we're going to spend a week over there,'' said Koppel before
leaving for Jerusalem from which most of the shows will be
broadcast.
   Monday night's one-hour broadcast will feature an interview with
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzak Rabin, as well as other guests not
yet lined up as of this weekend.
   Likewise, guests for the ``town hall meeting'' on Tuesday had
not been determined. Koppel said participants would include
Israelis and Palestinians, though selection of Palestinian
representatives was difficult because Israeli government officials
will not participate if there's anyone sympathetic to the Palestine
Liberation Organization involved.
   The trip was planned last year, Koppel said, before the recent
violence on the Israeli-occupied West Bank prompted new interest in
the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.
   ``What we're trying to do is make it clearer to an American
audience what the different positions are and also make it clear
what you're dealing with is not a homogenous Israeli point of view
or for that matter a homogenous Palestinian point of view. There
are shadings,'' said Koppel.
   ``Part of what we're going to try to do out there, and I'd say
probably the most important thing we going to try to do is provide
a context that critics of television, I think quite correctly, have
suggested we have not been providing over the past couple of
years.''
   The rest of the week's schedule was not set, though Koppel said
he hoped to interview King Hussein. That show would originate from
Amman, Jordan.
   As far going to the West Bank itself, Koppel said, ``I'm sure
I'll be taking a few field trips.''
   Koppel said officials in the region had been cooperative so far,
but he added: ``I've spent too much time in the Middle East to take
anything for granted. I'll find out when I get on the air.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz attended
religious services in the Soviet Union on Sunday, extolling the
``spread and acceptance of faith'' in a subtle jab at this nation's
institutionalized atheism.
   Shultz flew out of Tbilisi, the capital of the southern Soviet
republic of Georgia in the Caucasus Mountains, after a day of
sightseeing.
   He headed for Brussels, Belgium, to brief members of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization on his talks in Moscow Thursday and
Friday with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Before he left, in Tblisi and in Kiev, he delivered an overt
message on religious freedom, attending the Georgian Orthodox
Cathedral here Sunday and St. Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev on
Saturday.
   Even at a lavish lunch here with dozens of writers, singers and
artists, Shultz went out of his way in a toast to say: ``I could
feel, in a sense, I was in the presence of the Creator.''
   In Kiev, Shultz also visited Babi Yar, the Nazi killing ground
in World War II, where tens of thousands of Jews and other
Ukrainians were slaughtered.
   ``We have to say to ourselves always, never again,'' Shultz
vowed.
   In St. Sophia's, a cathedral that Communist authorities have
converted into a museum, Shultz said the majestic building ``just
shows you the commitment of and power of religion.''
   In an evolving human rights policy, Shultz has kept up U.S.
pressure on the Soviets to expand Jewish emigration while pressing
for more freedom of religious practices for all citizens.
   Tblisi, a relatively relaxed city far from Moscow, has
functioning churches and even two jewish synagogues. Shultz,
addressing the patriarch, Iliya II, and the congregants who jammed
the small cathedral, said he understood their desire for ``progress
in belief, in religion.''
   ```You must be meaning progress in the spread and acceptance of
faith because it has an immense continuity,'' Shultz said, ``It
couldn't be more evident them being here in this church.''
   Shultz and Shevardnadze reported little progress in the talks,
which focused on a treaty that would halve U.S. and Soviet arsenals
of strategic nuclear weapons.
   The goal had been to complete the treaty by May 29 when
President Reagan journeys to Moscow for a summit meeting with
Gorbachev. But officials have expressed doubt the pact will be
ready by then because too many disagreements remain.

   Oliver Ratliff doesn't know what the
12,000-pound acorn-shaped piece of iron is, but he likes it.
   Workers from Ratliff Bros. & Co. were clearing a site for a
restaurant in Abingdon when they dug up the massive object buried
about a foot underground.
   His workers hauled it back to Kewanee, thinking the iron might
be worth several hundred dollars. But Ratliff says the mystery
object has brought him so much attention he won't scrap it.
   Now, Kewanee is abuzz as folks in this town of 14,500 try to
figure out what it is.
   ``At first we were worried it was a bomb,'' said Ratliff, 68,
who has unearthed many strange things in his 46 years in the
construction business.
   Army bomb specialists examined the find Tuesday and determined
it wasn't a bomb. But that was all they could say.
   ``Everyone in town is plotting and scheming to explain what this
thing is,'' said Steve Bialowbreski, a truck dispatcher at
Ratliff's. ``There is no way it's a wrecking ball because it's too
heavy and there's no way to hook on to it.''
   Ratliff ran his hand along the rusted exterior of the object as
it sat Friday in the rear of his company's yard.
   ``Whatever it is, it sure was made nice,'' he said.
   Some Ratliff workers think the 3-by-5-foot hunk of iron is an
old bank safe.
   Retiree Jim Cinnamon speculated that the thing was a weight used
to anchor something huge _ a blimp or a crane; farmer John Betts
theorized it's the base for a flagpole.
   Ratliff and some of his friends have tried, with no success, to
drill into the object.
   With the mystery unsolved, Ratliff is considering sandblasting
the knob, painting it and using it to mark the entrance to his
business.
   ``Maybe it would become a tourist attraction,'' he said.

   It was a clash of wits in the tradition of
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the Founding Fathers and
the Ivy League. In the end, the U.S. Senate and Brown University
emerged as winners.
   Teams from Yale University and Brown took sides in the final
round of the National Debate Championships on whether to abolish
the Senate.
   Yale senior Bart Aronson, taking his role of prime minister for
a make-believe Her Majesty's Government quite seriously, denounced
the Senate as ``fundamentally undemocratic.'' He called it a rich
man's club that slows the legislative process and unfairly shifts
power to small states.
   His partner, Victor Miller, pressed the attack, questioning the
purpose of creating a Congress with two houses _ the 200-year-old
compromise between large states like Virginia and small ones like
Rhode Island.
   ``Why should an artificial boundary like a state have a voice,
Mr. Speaker? People should have a voice,'' insisted Miller.
   But Brown's Jason Grumet, speaking for Her Majesty's Loyal
Opposition, countered that ``all political boundaries are
artificial. Except for rivers, there's nothing separating us from
Canada. I don't want to share things with Canada.''
   Swayed by this nationalism, traditionalism, federalism _ or the
Brown team's more humorous heckles _ the audience declared the
Opposition team the winners Saturday by a 2-1 margin.
   About 50 two-student teams competed at the two-day tournament at
Johns Hopkins University sponsored by the American Parliamentary
Debate Association.

   James Garner's condition is improving and the
actor has been moved out of intensive care following last week's
quintuple heart bypass surgery, hospital officials said.
   ``He is really doing quite well,'' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
spokeswoman Paula Correia said Sunday.
   Garner, who won an Emmy for ``The Rockford Files'' television
series, underwent five hours of surgery Thursday.
   Doctors had planned to perform surgery for an aneurysm on his
aorta, the main artery carrying blood from the heart, but tests
determined he needed the bypass. Surgery for the aneurysm will be
scheduled later, hospital officials said.
   Garner, 60, blamed his heart problems on cigarettes.
   ``He said he regretted having smoked for 45 years,'' said
hospital spokesman Ron Wise.

   The publicist, whom People did not identify, confined comment to

facelift.
   Archer, 47, wrote the play ``Beyond Reasonable Doubt'' last July

   Vonnegut, author of ``Slaughterhouse-Five,'' ``Cat's Cradle''

such a book, puts it down, reads another book and eventually
returns to the first one, which he refers to as a ``conscience
book.''
   For those books he really wants to read, his pattern is to
consume them from beginning to end. If he discovers such a book

<TEXT>
   George Bush's spokesman suggests that there
is ``something really unseemly'' about efforts to promote this or
that person as the ideal vice presidential candidate.
   Democrat Michael Dukakis is even more blunt. ``The nominee makes
that decision,'' he says.
   But the people who are promoting various running mates as the
only real hope for the Republican or Democratic ticket in the fall
are not easily discouraged.
   To begin with, they tend to be people who thought neither Bush
nor Dukakis had a chance of surviving the primary season. Depending
on their place on the political spectrum, they spent much of the
past year dreaming that Mario Cuomo or Edward M. Kennedy, Pat
Buchanan or Jeane Kirkpatrick would bring some excitement to the
presidential race.
   Bush was saddled with the ``wimp factor,'' with Iran-Contra and
his unwillingness to talk about where he differed with President
Reagan. He was giving new definition to the phrase ``loyal to a
fault.''
   And Dukakis? Was the country ready to turn from Ronald Reagan to
the governor of Massachusetts, the state that is a national symbol
of liberalism? And talk about dull _ Dukakis often seemed to put
himself asleep.
   Despite the skeptics, here they are _ as close to a sure thing
as you get in American politics.
   The Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday should give Bush the 1,139
delegates he needs to claim a majority at the Republican National
Convention next August in New Orleans.
   That same primary should give Dukakis a fourth straight primary
victory and convince most of the remaining doubters that the
Massachusetts governor will be the candidate chosen in Atlanta in
July to recapture the White House for the Democrats.
   But the skeptics still doubt either man can win in November
without considerable help from a carefully chosen running mate.
   Dukakis has a perceived problem of geography.
   Not since 1976, when Georgian Jimmy Carter was at the top of the
ticket, has a Democratic presidential candidate carried the South.
Carter carried 10 of 11 Southern states in 1976, but four years
later lost 10 of 11 states in the region to Ronald Reagan.
   This year, conventional wisdom is the Democrats need to carry
the South.
   Southern legislators came up with the dubious idea of a Southern
regional primary as the way to ensure that the party would pick
somebody acceptable to the South.
   But the big winners on Super Tuesday were Dukakis and Jesse
Jackson. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, the favorite of the
white Southern establishment, also did well but never could win a
major state outside the region.
   To bolster his Southern strength, Dukakis is being urged to
choose from a small group of Southern senators _ Sam Nunn of
Georgia, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas or Bob Graham of Florida.
   Nunn is viewed as the party's most impressive spokesman on
national security issues, an area where Dukakis is seen as
potentially vulnerable. But on domestic policy Nunn is a Reagan
Democrat. Bentsen and Graham have more basic credentials _ each
comes from a state that is high on the Democrats' short list of
those their nominee must carry in November.
   Neither Bush nor his party has to worry as much about geography.
After all, Bush is from practically everywhere _ claiming ties with
Massachusetts, where he was born; Connecticut, where he grew up;
Texas, where he now has a home; and Maine where he has a home and a
burial plot.
   In obvious contrast to the Democrats, the Republicans have been
looking unbeatable in the South and West in recent presidential
elections.
   But Bush makes a lot of Republicans nervous. Some think he's a
weak candidate; others find him ideologically suspect.
   The party's conservative wing wants a signal from Bush that he
is a loyal conservative who won't ditch the Reagan agenda if he
becomes president. What they now view as the clearest signal would
be the choice of one of their own as his running mate.
   Few people set conservative hearts aflutter like Jeane
Kirkpatrick, the hardline former U.N. ambassador. So now comes Curt
Clinkscales, a conservative activist, who has formed an
unauthorized committee to draft Mrs. Kirkpatrick for the GOP ticket
_ an effort the former ambassador disavowed through a spokesman.
   ``She believes the decision on the vice president should be
solely that of Vice President Bush,'' said Mark Salter.
   Nor was it encouraged by Peter Teeley, spokesman for Bush.
   ``These efforts are sometimes embarrassing to the people that
they're allegedly designed to help,'' he said. ``There's just
something really unseemly about trying to force somebody onto a
ticket... to throw them forward in an effort they haven't
sanctioned themselves.''
   About the only politician who regularly campaigns for the vice
presidential nomination is Endicott Peabody, the former governor of
Massachusetts who now resides in New Hampshire.
   However, Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, who was a conservative
favorite in the early stages of this year's presidential campaign,
now is coming as closed to Peabody as he can get.
   Kemp denies he's running for the vice presidency, but makes no
secret that he'd love to have the job.
   ``Anybody in the Republican Party would have to look upon the
vice presidency with interest,'' he said. ``But _ and it was a very
large but _ I said I don't expect it.''

<HEAD>Gorbachev Has Work Cut Out Improving Soviet Economy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev is facing
serious obstacles in his effort to overhaul the troubled,
inefficient Soviet economy and things aren't likely to improve
anytime soon, according to U.S. intelligence agencies.
   ``Gorbachev's ambitious program to create a modern, more dynamic
Soviet economy ran into trouble in 1987,'' says a joint study by
the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency.
   ``The short-term outlook for Gorbachev's economic program is not
good,'' concluded the study, which was released Sunday by the
congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   ``The real loser in 1987 appeared to be the consumer, who _ now
three years into Gorbachev's economic program _ has seen almost no
increase in his standard of living,'' the study said.
   The main problems last year were poor weather and resistance to
change in the huge, slow-moving Soviet bureaucracy, said the report.
   As a result, the Soviet gross national product grew only 0.5
percent last year, compared with a 3.9 percent increase in 1986,
which was the first full year of Gorbachev's term.
   The gross national product is the total value of all goods and
services produced and is a key measure of an economy.
   By contrast, the U.S. GNP grew by 2.9 percent in both 1986 and
1987, but the American economy is much larger and exact comparisons
are difficult to make.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee, said the study shows ``the Soviet economy did not pause
last year, it stumbled. This does not mean that the reform program
is necessarily doomed or that Gorbachev will be ousted.''
   ``It is still too soon to pass judgment on the reforms or on
Gorbachev's leadership,'' Proxmire said.
   The study predicted that unless Gorbachev can turn things
around, he faces trouble.
   ``Tension within society and the leadership will increase,'' it
said. ``Bureaucrats will become increasingly frustrated by loss of
privileges and status and by demands that they show greater
initiative. Military leaders are likely to become more and more
uneasy if benefits from the industrial modernization fail to
materialize.
   ``Soviet citizens will need to see some improvement in living
standards if the regime is to achieve necessary gains in worker
productivity and avoid widespread discontent,'' the study said.
   ``Failure to head off these tensions would, at a minimum, make
it more difficult to pursue his economic program vigorously and
could ultimately call into question his strong political position
at home,'' the study said.
   The study was presented April 13. The Joint Economic Committee
released a declassified version.
   When Gorbachev took over in March 1985, the study noted, he
inherited an aging, backward, extremely inefficient economy. He
made reform a top priority.
   Last year's problems were caused by a combination of factors,
the study said.
   ``Familiar problems with poor weather and transportation
bottlenecks were compounded by the disruptions caused by the
introduction of economic reforms,'' it said.
   Agricultural output fell because of bad weather. Industrial
quality control measures also ``proved to be particularly
disruptive, especially early in the year.'' Thus, industry only
grew 1.5 percent and the civilian machine-building sector didn't
grow at all.

   Gov. Arch Moore is finding that perhaps
his toughest opponent in his re-election bid is the image he helped
create for himself.
   The almost mythical Moore benefited from an influx of federal
funds and a healthy economy as he opened highways, constructed
buildings and created jobs during his first two terms from 1969 to
1977.
   But he has been criticized during his third term as skippering a
rudderless ship awash in financial problems that the captain cannot
or will not control.
   Moore, 65, faces his first serious political challenge in May
10's GOP primary in which he is seeking an unprecedented fourth
term. His opponent, Morgantown businessman John Raese, is an
aggressive campaigner who has capitalized on the state's woes.
   ``Everybody changes as they mature,'' former state GOP Chairman
Kent Strange Hall said of Moore. ``I think the real changes are the
circumstances and conditions in which he's operating.
   ``Number one, he doesn't have the money that was available
either through federal funding or the state's economy. And
secondly, he doesn't have the team of department heads and advisers
he had in the first eight years.''
   Moore's administrative abilities have drawn the most fire. Even
administration officials concede that when Moore was returned to
office in 1984, people expected a miracle turnaround that Moore has
been unable to produce.
   The governor can point to a record of hard work, a gradual
reduction in the unemployment rate and increased industrial
development, but the days of major announcements have ended.
   A spokesman for the state Manufacturers Association, for
instance, says the state has lost 36 major plants between 1979 and
1986, idling 4,450 workers, and said 28,000 manufacturing jobs were
lost in the plants that remain open.
   Moore's first two terms were marked by a burgeoning economy.
Federal money poured into the state, and Moore took the credit. He
seemed to be everywhere at once, opening 225 miles of West
Virginia's 515 miles of interstate highway, overseeing construction
of the state Science and Cultural Center on the Capitol grounds,
and luring new businesses.
   The myth of the all-knowing, all-seeing leader is one that he
helped cultivate in a state where registered Democrats outnumber
Republicans 2-1.
   Even a 1976 federal extortion indictment did not slow him. On
the day he was indicted, Moore called a news conference to announce
he would seek a third consecutive term, although the state
constitution appeared to prohibit it.
   Moore was acquitted, but the state Supreme Court barred his
re-election bid.
   He left what he said was a $234 million budget surplus, a
booming interstate highway building program and reasonably strong
coal, steel and glass industries.
   Moore opened a law practice and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S.
Senate in 1978 and governor in 1980.
   When Moore again entered the governor's office for an
unprecedented third term in 1985, he found the state in much
different shape.
   The unemployment rate hit 18 percent the year before as the
state's economy hit rock-bottom. The state faced a $250 million
debt in the unemployment compensation fund that had been run up by
Democratic Gov. Jay Rockefeller. The Legislature had enacted huge
tax increases. And federal funding for highway construction and
other projects dwindled.
   Moore asked the Legislature for a myriad of economic tools to
attract business, and later claimed success. He says he has
attracted more than $1 billion in development money during each of
the past two years, and that the unemployment rate dropped below 11
percent in 1987.
   Critics, however, scoffed at his economic announcements, saying
thousands have fled seeking jobs elsewhere. A West Virginia
University study found the state lost 52,600 of its 1.9 million
residents since 1980.
   Raese, a newspaper publisher and coal and limestone company
owner, calls himself a conservative, pro-business candidate. He
says Moore has failed to adjust spending to the state's dwindling
tax income.
   ``Arch Moore is just a credit card governor,'' Raese said during
a recent interview. ``He's marching to an old liberal tune of the
late 1950s and early 1960s.''
   According to a poll released today, Raese holds a substantial
lead over Moore among Republicans and independents, 54 percent to
30 percent. Sixty-nine percent of the Republicans surveyed rated
Moore's performance as governor as poor or fair.
   The poll, conducted by The Associated Press, the Charleston
Daily Mail and WSAZ-TV, had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage
points.

   The nation's 870,000 government

official said today.
   Yusof Noor, a government minister, told reporters that people
applying for 185,000 vacant government positions also will be

   There are an estimated 500,000 drug addicts in Malaysia out of a

drug addiction is common among government workers and that the
testing was merely a precaution.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Threatens Northeast Coastal Waters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have concluded that acid rain is one
of the main pollutants threatening marine life in Atlantic coastal
waters, The New York Times reported Monday.
   Up to now, most experts have assumed that agricultural runoff
and sewage were the major culprits responsible for the increasing
number of mass killings of marine life along the Northeast coast,
the newspaper said.
   But a new report prepared by scientists of the Environmental
Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental group, shows for the first
time that acid rain is also contributing to the problem, according
to the newspaper.
   Acid rain comes from nitrogen oxides in emissions from
automobiles, power plants and other industries. The oxides are
converted into nitric acids and nitrates in the atmosphere.
   Nitrate salts and other nutrients encourage the growth of algae,
which in turn use up oxygen needed by other plants and animals
living in the coastal waters, according to the report.
   ``It is choking off the ocean's nurseries,'' said Dr. Michael
Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist for the environmental group
and a co-author of the report. ``It is shutting down the playground
for millions of Americans.'
   ``It is a regionwide problem, and it is only going to get worse
because of the projected growth of nitrogen emissions,'' he added.
   The study focuses on Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and
found that atmospheric sources account for 25 percent of the
nitrogen pouring into the bay each year.
   Fertilizers account for 34 percent, sewage and other industrial
discharges 23 percent, and animal wastes, including runoff from
land and evaporated ammonium from manure that travels through the
atmosphere, 18 percent.
   If current trends continue, atmospheric nitrates will constitute
42 percent of annual nitrogen deposits into the bay by the year
2030, according to the report.
   The conclusion of the report was endorsed by other scientists
who have read drafts of it, including Joel S. O'Connor, an
ecologist with the Waste Management Institute of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, according to the Times.
   George Hidy, director of the environment division of the
Electric Power Institute _ a research association of utility
companies that emit large amounts of sulfur and nitrogen from their
plants _ called the report's findings ``an interesting and
surprising hypothesis that needs to be verified.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Vet Collects 8mm Home Movies Of The War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Michael M. Wiese has seen the Vietnam War
twice: first-hand as a gunner on a helicopter, and through fleeting
images captured by soldiers on 8mm home movie film.
   Wiese, 38, estimates he has collected 1,000 hours of amateur
footage during the last decade. Some of it is entertaining and some
is boring but little is gory. All of it helps neutralize the
nightmare of Vietnam, Wiese says.
   He has pieced together some of his best footage in a 90-minute
videocassette being test marketed in the Indianapolis area. The
tape, ``Helicopter Gunship Assault,'' is the first of what Wiese
hopes will be a series of at least six tapes.
   ``In 90 percent of the film, it's unknown to me who took it or
where it was taken,'' he said. ``But still, everybody wanted to
watch it because what a soldier would take a picture of over there
just to show mom was not what they were showing on the news.''
   To Wiese, who spent seven months behind a machine gun aboard an
Army helicopter, the film ``is the best therapy I ever had. It's
like reliving a nightmare. If you relive it long enough, it's not a
nightmare anymore. I've watched this 300 times, and I'm never bored.
   ```Nam was such a hard story for everybody to tell people back
home about,'' he said. ``This makes the memories bubble out of
you.''
   Some footage shows soldiers escaping the war on a muggy day by
landing their helicopters on a riverbank and taking a swim. Another
scene shows helicopters dropping down to rescue patrols under
attack. There are scenes of helicopter gunships firing at ground
targets and receiving return fire.
   Most of the footage is remarkably intact after 20 years; little
of the color has faded.
   One pilot shows the hut he made from scrap wood and discarded
rocket boxes after his tent rotted through.
   Another narrates as a dog yaps in the background.
   ``If you watch over to the left, you'll see the tracers coming
up at us,'' he says. ``There they are.''
   Wiese says he has come across few gory scenes. ``I have some
helicopter accidents,'' he says. ``I got aftermath of an ambush.
But actual combat footage, I don't have much,'' he said. ``Soldiers
were paid to keep their heads down.''
   Vietnam was the first war in which soldiers could carry a
lightweight camera with automatic shutter control and focusing
capability.
   Still, Wiese says very little 8mm footage was shot in Vietnam.
   His first three reels were purchased for $1 each at a flea
market. ``They were very boring,'' he said.
   ``I wanted at one time to collect photographs _ I lost my own
collection,'' he said. ``And everyone has photos. But the 8mm stuff
is real rare.''
   So he started placing ads in local papers and national
publications asking veterans to send him their film. He then
transferred the film to VHS tape, returning one tape and the
original film to the owner, and keeping a copy for himself. When
possible, he got the soldiers to send an audio cassette narrative.
   Wiese, who formed a company called ``Vietnam Archives,'' has the
owner sign an agreement giving him rights to the film. ``I promise
to give them a royalty on each cassette,'' he said.
   He hopes to place his videos in libraries.
   ``I'm no Steven Spielberg,'' said Wiese. ``My intention is a
real simple one: to collect this film and save it. I think some of
it is worth being preserved.
   ``And it's great to get a bunch of guys together and sit down
and watch this. You just can't believe the lies these guy will tell
from their war stories.''

   A young man was shot to death Sunday in
a gang-related scuffle as he stood in line for the movie
``Colors,'' police said.
   A 17-year-old was suffered minor injuries outside the Regency
Cinema when the bullet passed through the 19-year-old's head and
hit her, said Lt. David Wim.
   ``Colors,'' which stars Sean Penn and Robert Duvall and opened
nationwide April 15, portrays the Los Angeles Crips and Bloods
gangs. It opened amid fears it would inspire more bloodshed, but
until Sunday little violence materialized.
   The assailant, a man in his 20s, wore a red handkerchief
denoting membership in the Bloods; the victim wore the blue
handkerchief of the Crips, Swain said.
   Swain the gunman had gotten out of a car and approached the
19-year-old, asking, ``Are you a ricket?'' Swim said the word is a
derogatory term for the Crips.
   The victim's girlfriend stepped between the two, a scuffle broke
out involving two of the gunman's companions and the victim's
brother-in-law, and the victim was shot in the head as he started
to run, police said.
   Police and sheriff's deputies have kept up a presence at
theaters in Los Angeles and other places with gang problems during
the screening of the movie, and some theaters across the nation
have declined to show the film.
   Minor scuffles at an opening in Los Angeles led to 13 arrests.

<HEAD>Dropping Water Table Means Long-term Changes in Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was part of what explorer Zebulon Pike in
1806 called the Great American Desert, the High Plains where grass
was the natural crop and buffaloes roamed far and wide.
   Pike's adventures along the Arkansas River to the Rocky
Mountains gave rise to a notion at the time that the huge region of
low rainfall, short grass and few natural water holes was a natural
barrier that would limit U.S. westward expansion.
   Farmers tried to tame it with the plow, but often drought and
crop failure dominated the huge region, generally west of the 100th
meridian. Dryland farming, the settlers found, was a precarious
business in the Great American Desert.
   It began to change after enterprising farmers tapped underground
water supplies for large-scale irrigation. A huge, invisible lake _
the Ogallala Aquifer _ was a gold mine for parts of Texas, New
Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado and Nebraska.
   But for years the underground water level has been receding,
forcing deeper drilling and greater pumping costs. Already
irrigation has become uneconomical for many.
   ``In order to maintain a viable agricultural economy, this area
must return to a dryland type of production,'' says Agriculture
Department economist Wendell Holmes in the current issue of
Farmline magazine. ``How soon the transition will be made depends
somewhat on how willing farmers are to change their irrigation
practices.''
   Holmes said ``it seems reasonable to assume'' that some
irrigation will continue for a number of years. New technologies
and more drought-tolerant plants may help for a time.
   ``Whatever the time, though, adjustments must be made in order
to be ready when the wells run dry,'' he said.
   Holmes and a colleague, Mindy Petrulis, in the department's
Economic Research Service studied an area of the high plains in
West Texas, which included seven irrigated counties and eight
neighboring dryland counties.
   The irrigated counties included Castro, Crosby, Floyd, Hale,
Lamb, Parmer and Swisher, while the dryland counties were Baylor,
Cottle, Foard, Haskell, King, Knox, Stonewall and Throckmorton.
   Holmes said the irrigated counties enjoyed an economic boom in
the 1940s and 1950s as irrigation became widespread. A move to
``center pivot'' systems made it possible to nearly triple yields
of cotton, wheat and corn on land previously farmed without
irrigation.
   By 1960, the Texas high plains had become one of the most
irrigation-dependent areas of the United States.
   But the nearby dryland counties, which lie just to the east of
the Ogallala Aquifer, have never had enough water from surface or
below-ground sources to develop agriculture based on irrigation.
Holmes said that has been apparent from their economic performance
beginning in the 1940s.
   ``The economy of the dryland farming area continued to stagnate
and periodically worsen, because of the lack of water for crops,''
Holmes said. ``One effect has been a continued heavy outmigration
of rural people.''
   For example, between 1940 and 1984, the total population of the
dryland counties was cut in half and employment was reduced by a
fourth.
   In contrast, Holmes said, the irrigated counties experienced
rapid economic growth and development during most of the 1940-84
period. Despite a small decline in the last few decades, total
population in the mid-1980s exceeded 100,000 people, a 38 percent
increase from 1940, and employment at about 41,000 was up nearly 80
percent.
   Meanwhile, in the dryland counties that weren't blessed with an
abundance of water, farms grew larger and fewer in order to
maintain their incomes, and population dropped by 32 percent from
1940 to 1959.
   ``Dryland farming does not require a large labor force, nor can
it support a large rural or urban population,'' Holmes said.
``Thus, there was little inducement for people to move into the
area or, having been born there, to stay. More and more people
found employment elsewhere.''
   But by 1960, the fast-track development of the irrigated
counties slowed down. From 1959 to 1978, he said, the value of farm
products sold increased about 60 percent, compared with a tenfold
increase in the previous 19 years.
   And by 1978, almost 2,400 irrigation farmers had gone out of
business and 140,000 acres of cropland had been taken out of
irrigation. Rising costs of energy took a toll.
   The tough times continued among dryland farmers, too. Population
in those counties dropped by more than a fourth from 1959 to 1978,
total employment was down more than a tenth, and 31 percent of the
farm operators went out of business, Holmes said.
   In the 1980s, the financial situation for farmers across the
nation deepened as debt piled up, land values declined and interest
rates edged higher.
   Between 1978 and 1984, the total value of farm products sold
dropped 4 percent in the irrigated counties, while they increased
about 10 percent in the dryland area.
   Holmes said the population of the irrigated counties in 1978-84
declined about 3 percent, and total employment decreased for the
first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
   The trends were much different in the dryland counties. Farm
income rose 22 percent, compared with an 18 percent decline in the
irrigated counties.
   Holmes said that was because the proportion of total farm sales
from wheat in the dryland areas tripled from 1978 to 1984 because
of government price support programs. And dryland farm operations
cost much less.
   In fact, he said, per capita income in the dryland counties in
1984 was higher than it had ever been in the irrigated counties.
Unfortunately, the long decades of decline in the dryland counties
had resulted in a grim bottoming out.
   ``So many people have left that the economy has finally
stabilized, and most of those who remain are those with the jobs
that are still available,'' Holmes said.

<HEAD>Star Wars, MX, Midgetman Up for House Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House will revisit familiar battlegrounds
this week when it takes up a massive Pentagon budget bill and tries
to decide how much to spend on Star Wars and nuclear missiles such
as the Midgetman and MX.
   ``We don't seem to be able to decide anything once and for
all,'' said Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., as
he looked forward to the annual debate over how much money to
authorize for the largest single agency of the federal government.
   It will take at least two weeks for the Democratic-controlled
chamber to plow through the huge bill and the 240 amendments which
already have been proposed.
   The Pentagon budget sparks long debate each year, Aspin noted,
because House rules require that amendments be germane to the
subject of the bill at hand.
   That tends to limit debate on other measures, but Aspin said,
``Anyone who wants to offer an amendment on just about anything can
find something in the defense bill that it is germane to.''
   The bill authorizes the Pentagon to spend $299 billion in the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, an amount that was set five months
ago. White House and congressional leaders agreed on the overall
figure in December as part of a package designed to reduce federal
deficits.
   The agreement on the overall budget ``left us free to
concentrate on smaller issues,'' Aspin noted. It also speeded up
the process of writing the bill, which normally doesn't go to the
House floor until June or later.
   The $299 billion is $33 billion less than the Pentagon had
expected to have, and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci has ordered
reductions in a number of programs to meet that goal.
   While the total budget is less than the Pentagon wanted, the
huge bill includes money to buy another Trident missile-firing
submarine, two more attack submarines, the first of a new class of
Seawolf subs, 180 F-16 jets, 42 F-15s, 72 Apache attack
helicopters, 611 M-1 tanks, 550 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and
three Navy destroyers.
   The measure which passes the House will eventually have to be
reconciled with the bill the Senate approves. The Senate Armed
Services Committee has just begun the process of writing its
defense bill, meaning the measure isn't likely to reach the Senate
floor until mid-year or later.
   As in past years, one of the major battles will be over the
budget for Reagan's Star Wars program, known formally as the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   Reagan sought $4.8 billion for the program, which is receiving
$3.9 billion this year. But Aspin's committee cut the figure to
$4.0 billion, barely above the current budget and $600 million less
than the amount set last week by a Senate subcommittee.
   ``I expect we'll have moves on the Star Wars budget from both
the right and left,'' said Aspin, explaining that conservatives
will try to increase the SDI budget while liberals will seek to cut
it.
   During the committee consideration of the bill, there were four
amendments to set the SDI budget and at least that many are likely
to be offered on the floor.
   Another contentious issue is the Midgetman versus MX fight. Both
the nuclear weapons are land-based missiles and are designed to
replace the aging Minuteman as part of the nation's atomic
deterrence force.
   Reagan originally wanted 100 of the 10-warhead MX weapons, but
Congress approved only 50 for basing in western silos and said the
Pentagon should develop the single-warhead, mobile Midgetman
because it would be easier to hide from Soviet attack.
   Now, the Pentagon is proposing to build 50 more MX weapons and
put them aboard trains to make it tougher for the Soviets to find
the missiles.
   Reagan sought $840 million for the railroad version of the MX
and $200 million for research into Midgetman. Carlucci said the
latter amount was included only to meet a congressional request to
keep the program alive until Reagan's successor can make a decision
on its future.
   But Aspin's committee gave $500 million each to Midgetman and MX
and ``you'll see a number of amendments to re-divide that pie on
the floor,'' he said. ``I don't know where we'll come out
eventually on that one.''
   The House will also consider a variety of arms control
restrictions, similar to those which were added on the House floor
last year.
   One would require continued U.S. adherence to the unratified
SALT II nuclear arms treaty, a pact that Reagan says he will no
longer follow. Another would block all but the smallest tests of
U.S. nuclear weapons, while a third would continue a 3-year-old
moratorium set by Congress on testing of anti-satellite weapons.
The administration opposes all three measures.

<HEAD>Plans Due for Memorial Honoring Slain Police Officers</HEAD>

   Design and construction plans will be
announced next month for a National Law Enforcement Officers'
Memorial honoring the 30,000 police officers who have been killed
on duty in the United States.
   More than $500,000 has been raised from private contributions
toward the $5 million cost of the memorial, which will be built on
a government site in downtown Washington's judiciary district near
metropolitan police headquarters.
   The land was donated by the government, but when Congress
unanimously approved the memorial in 1984, it specified that all
construction funds must be raised privately before the
groundbreaking, tentatively scheduled for May 1989.
   Sponsors representing 15 major police organizations expect the
memorial to be completed in May 1990, in time for National Peace
Officers' Memorial Day, observed here annually for the past eight
years to honor officers killed on duty.
   The final memorial design by Washington architect Davis Buckley
and a construction timetable will be announced May 13 at a news
conference.
   More than 6,000 law enforcement officers, relatives and friends
are expected to gather that weekend to honor their fallen comrades
and recognize those who ``put their lives on the line for our
protection every hour of every day,'' said Craig W. Floyd,
executive director of the National Law Enforcement Officers'
Memorial Fund.
   In the past 10 years, 1,431 police officers have been killed,
210,555 have been wounded and 583,699 have been assaulted, Floyd
said. Of the 600,000 active law enforcement officers in the United
States, he said, one is killed every 48 hours.

   Members of the U.S. Senate have been trying to
put their legislative affairs on a faster track but have been
stymied by a problem some of their constituents have long faced _
slow trains.
   In the Senate's case, the problem is a 30-year-old subway system
that links two of the three Senate office buildings to the Capitol.
   The senators complain the subway trains just don't move often
enough and fast enough to get them to the Senate chambers for
roll-call votes.
   Now, a Senate committee has asked the Capitol architect to come
up with a full report on the costs of modernizing the subway
system. An early estimate of the price tag: $10 million.
   The Senate made its first stab at making legislating a more
orderly affair in February, when it put itself on a new work
schedule.
   One of the changes was to limit roll-call votes _ which
sometimes took an hour or more while the Senate waited for an
absent member to arrive _ to a strict 15 minutes each, no
exceptions.
   Shortly after the new rules were enacted, several members
complained that they had arrived at the station at the Hart Office
Building _ some four blocks from the Capitol _ with a minute or two
to spare to make a roll call, but the subway car was jammed with
visitors. They had to wait for the car to return _ a round trip
takes about five minutes _ and they missed the vote.
   Half of the 100 senators have offices in the Hart building.
   After complaints were made, new rules were issued for the
subway: No one but senators can ride during roll-call votes.
   The Senate Rules and Administration Committee also called on
Capitol Architect George White to study the subway system and seek
a long-term solution to the problems facing senators coming from
the Dirksen and Hart office buildings. The Russell Office Building
has its own line with two sets of tracks.
   White recommended to the committee last week that the Senate
replace the current two-train shuttle system with a new system of
four small trains following one another at one-minute intervals
over what he described as a ``pinched loop.''
   The vehicles would stop at each station in Dirksen and Hart. The
current system has one car on the track to Dirksen and one on the
track to Hart, returning on the same line.
   White said the new system could be completed in about 30 months
and would provide ``a greatly improved, frequent, fast and
convenient service to and from the Capitol.''
   White rejected another proposal for a moving sidewalk which he
said would not be fast enough to handle the Senate's needs.
   After White estimated the cost of the new subway at $10 million,
Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah asked: ``Now what do you estimate the real
cost to be?''
   White replied that his estimate was conservative.
   Chairman Wendell Ford, D-Ky., then asked White if he thought the
cost would be more than $10 million. White replied that he thought
it would be less.
   Garn wasn't convinced.
   ``Having been here 14 years, I have yet to see anything that
didn't cost more than we originally estimated,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration Softening Position on Fair Housing</HEAD>

   The Reagan administration is softening its
opposition to Democrat-sponsored fair housing legislation but still
opposes provisions it says would deny the right to trial by jury
and be unfair to elderly people, according to a Housing and Urban
Development official.
   Another administration objection _ that a new ban of
discrimination against the handicapped could force landlords to
accept drug addicts or alcoholics _ was addressed in two amendments
passed last week.
   The bill, expected to be voted on Tuesday in the House Judiciary
Committee, would toughen enforcement of the Fair Housing Act of
1968 and expand it to ban discrimination against handicapped people
and families with children in rental or sale of living space. A
similar bill has been introduced in the Senate.
   The administration had introduced its own fair housing
legislation and favors an expansion of the act which now bans
discrimination on the bases of sex, ethnic origin or religion.
   But it is wary of the version now being discussed in the House
Judiciary Committee, believing it may be unconstitutional and
unfair to some landlords, tenants and home buyers, HUD general
counsel J. Michael Dorsey said in an interview Friday.
   The committee last week rejected changes that would have met
some administration objections, but it tentatively approved one
excluding abusers of controlled substances from being classified as
handicapped.
   Another amendment would allow landlords or sellers to reject
people ``whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the
health or safety of other individuals.''
   Dorsey said there is broad agreement that discrimination against
the handicapped should be added to the law. But he had said in a
letter to the Judiciary Committee last week that the Democratic
version ``does not clearly allow those who provide housing to
exclude individuals with current impairments, such as current drug
abuse, that pose a threat to property or safety of others.''
   Major objections to the bill have come from the Justice
Department which opposes the setting up of an administrative law
judge system to handle discrimination cases, rather than having
them go to a regular jury.
   Dorsey said that despite strong objections to parts of the
proposed bill, the administration is taking a softer stand than it
has in the past. But he said it has not altered its major
objections to the Democratic proposals.
   ``We are not saying anything about a veto at this point at
all,'' he said.
   President Reagan has submitted four bills to amend fair housing
laws _ in 1983, 1985, 1986 and this year. Dorsey said the current
Democratic bill is ``not the one that we would prefer.''
   But he indicated the administration wants fair housing laws
expanded before Reagan leaves office.
   Dorsey said the administration supports the idea that
discrimination cases can be brought for single incidents rather
than requiring that a pattern of discrimination be proven, which is
required under the 1968 law. But he said the administrative law
judge plan does not pass ``constitutional muster.''
   Dorsey noted that the provision banning discrimination on the
basis of ``familial status'' is designed to protect families with
children.
   But he said in the letter, ``This provision intended to ensure
fairness may well have substantial unfair effects'' on older
Americans and people without children.
   The bill allows retirement communities or buildings where all
the tenants are over 62 to ban children, but singles communities
that also have younger people in them would have to accept families
with children.
   Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, which endorses the Democratic bill, said that
despite administration opposition, he expects bipartisan support
for the final measure.
   ``This administration, led by the Department of Justice, has
compiled the worst civil rights record of any administration in
half a century,'' Neas said in a telephone interview.
   But he said the Justice Department has failed in all previous
efforts to limit civil rights and ``we believe once again a strong
bipartisan consensus will reject this one.''

   Organizers expect tens of thousands of
Christians to gather in Washington on Friday for a rally and
prayers for the future of the nation and the scandal-plagued
evangelical movement.
   The Washington for Jesus rally, which will be held on the grassy
Mall, will lead into a seven-day, around-the-clock prayer vigil
called National Praise and Prayer Week that will end at 6 p.m. on
May 5.
   ``We're gathering to ask God to heal our country and heal our
church,'' said the Rev. John Gimenez, pastor of Rock Church in
Virginia Beach, Va., and chairman of the rally's national steering
committee.
   The rally's aim, Gimenez said, is to show repentance ``because
the church has gotten away from the statutes of holiness,'' to
reconcile differences among Christians and to restore the church to
leadership.
   ``We as Christian leaders have a responsibility to our
country,'' Gimenez said. ``But we've been ineffective lately
because we've had trouble within our own ranks. We need to get
back.''
   Gimenez said he decided to organize the rally before the
sex-and-money scandals brought down three of the best-known
television evangelists _ Jim and Tammy Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
But, he said, he believes the rally will help the Christian cause
as well as help the country.
   ``I heard the voice of the Lord speak to me and say we should
have a gathering,'' he said.
   Gimenez says he got a similar message from God nearly a decade
ago, leading to the first prayer meeting on the Mall in 1980, which
attracted an estimated 200,000 people.
   ``We went to Washington to pray at that time because our country
was in trouble,'' Gimenez recalled. ``We felt we should gather to
ask forgiveness and to bring healing because our economy was in bad
shape, our citizens were being held prisoner in Iran.
   ``And lo and behold, our economy improved and our citizens were
released.''
   This time, he said, ``we're finding many of the same problems _
the Iranians, our economy is getting shakier, we have a drug
epidemic.''
   Although the rally is dedicated to reviving old-fashioned
Christian values, it will rely on the latest in technology to get
the message across.
   Nine huge screens, similar to those in baseball parks, will line
both sides of the Mall and stand behind the stage. The screens will
display the activities on stage and videotapes of people the
audience will be praying for. The stage, according to a Washington
for Jesus press release, is capable of seating a 1,500-voice choir,
a 100-piece orchestra a hundreds of dignitaries and Christian
leaders.
   Gimenez estimated the cost of organizing the rally at $1.3
million.
   Among the scheduled speakers are singer Pat Boone, TV minister
Kenneth Copeland and Christian radio show host James Dobson.
   Gimenez said the rally will not have any political overtones.
Pat Robertson was a speaker at the 1980 rally but isn't on the
schedule this time because he is running for the Republican
nomination for president, Gimenez said. And, he added, while the
rally is pro-Christian, it is not against other religions.
   ``This is a Jesus rally,'' he said. ``We are not in opposition
to other religious groups. This is a free country. They can have
rallies, too.''
   One major difference between the coming rally and the 1980
gathering is in the National Council of Churches' attitude. Eight
years ago, the council joined more than a dozen other religious
organizations in issuing a statement accusing Washington for Jesus
organizers of trying to ``Christianize the government.''
   This year, according to the Rev. Ernest Gibson, the council's
executive director, rally sponsors ``sought our assistance from the
beginning and they assured us that this will not just be a big
splash and then they'll leave town.
   ``They have agreed to help us develop drug treatment centers
that will be operated by local churches and they've agreed to help
develop and support a Christian network office that will promote
fellowship among Christians and meet human needs, like those of the
homeless,'' Gibson said.
   ``We've also been assured that this will not be a political
forum for a political candidate.''
   The rally will begin at 6 a.m. on Friday and last until 6 p.m.

   A Jehovah's Witnesses congregation met
in the church built in two days by about 650 people.
   Volunteers and congregation members from across Michigan began
work Friday on the 4,600-square-foot Kingdom Hall in Grand Haven
Township. It was near completion Sunday afternoon, said Phil Newell
of West Olive, a member of the congregation's building committee.
   ``We had our first meeting at 2 o'clock, and we're just
finishing up the landscaping work, spreading a little bark
around,'' Newell said. ``Everything came off beautiful. The
(township) inspectors were very impressed with the project and
excited to be part of it.''
   About a third of the 650 Jehovah's Witnesses who worked on the
project were skilled tradesmen who performed carpentry, plumbing
and electrical work, he said.
   Site and foundation work was done ahead of time.
   The new Kingdom Hall will seat 237 people, and cost the
congregation $170,000 to build.

   Over $3 billion worth of loans planned by
intergovernment banks to raise the standard of living in 20
countries are also likely to damage natural resources and the
environment, the U.S. government says.
   The United States is the biggest contributor to the banks, which
are a major source of aid to poor countries.
   By law, a list of loans considered dangerous by the U.S. Agency
for International Development will be distributed to other donors
such as Japan and the leading countries of western Europe. The
Associated Press obtained an advance copy.
   AID is particularly concerned about projects that dam up big
rivers in the tropics, that build roads into undeveloped parts of
the world and that try to develop rural areas.
   One of the biggest loans on the list would provide $420 million
from the World Bank for a dam on the Narmada River in central
India, second only to the Ganges in sacredness to Hindus. It will
displace 120,000 people, irrigate about 720,000 acres of land and
generate 1,000 megawatts of electricity.
   The agency says the project could also increase the risk of
earthquakes, of waterlogging the soil and of transmitting
water-borne diseases including malaria and cholera. As many as
96,000 acres will be cleared of forest and submerged.
   ``We continue to have concerns about this project and will
pursue them again with (World) Bank management as one of our top
priorities,'' the agency says.
   Congress has asked for such ``early warning'' reports to be made
every six months.
   ``We do not consider the list all inclusive,'' the agency
explains.
   It adds that the object is to encourage better planning of new
loan projects with the environment in mind.
   Six of the loans would go to Indonesia, including one from the
World Bank for $120 million to help a government effort that has
moved over 1.2 million families out of the overpopulated islands of
Java and Bali. The U.S. agency says it is worried about
insufficient help to people being moved, displacement of those who
already live near the new settlements, danger to water supply and
to wildlife.
   Another controversial project also involves the World Bank, and
its continued support for a major overhaul of Brazil's electric
power system. It involves a loan of $500 million.
   The agency says it is concerned about the impact on Brazil's
Indian populations and the region's ``sensitive ecosystem.''
British and West German officials joined the Americans in talking
to the bank's management in January. They were told that the loan
had been delayed until September or October, mostly for economic
reasons.
   The potential value of the 31 loans could be much higher than $3
billion. No estimates were available for five of them. Others are
for major projects on which the banks have already made loans and
may make more in the future.

   Michael Dukakis was getting his early
morning exercise walking down a Pittsburgh street, when someone
gave a cry of recognition: ``Hey, isn't that Caliguiri?''
   No, it wasn't Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri: It was the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
   ``I guess the mayor and I look alike,'' Dukakis said as he
described the Sunday morning greeting. ``There's an old saying in
Italian: `One face _ one race.' We're all part of the same family.''
   Far ahead in the polls here for Tuesday's primary, Dukakis said
the incident shows ``we need to do a lot of work to make sure
people know who Dukakis is on the ballot.''
   The Massachusetts governor himself is working hard _ taking a
whistle-stop train tour across western Pennsylvania on Sunday and
making a six-city flying tour of the state today.
   Dukakis is looking for a fourth straight big-state win here over
his surviving competitor _ Jesse Jackson _ to tighten his grip on
the front-runner's crown and widen his margin in the delegate count.
   ``If we can win big here Tuesday, it will give us a tremendous
boost,'' Dukakis told a big crowd of students on the Pennsylvania
State University campus, who were welcoming back his wife, Kitty, a
Penn State graduate.
   Through the cold, cloudy day in Pittsburgh, Greensburg,
Johnstown and Altoona, Dukakis hit over and over again on his
message of good jobs and economic development in a region
devastated by changes in the steel and coal industries.
   ``If we can't bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to
the Johnstowns of this country, then there is something the matter
with us,'' he told a crowd there. ``I believe we can. I believe
we're going to.''
   Dukakis drew the parallels between New England's economic
troubles of the past and Pennsylvania's troubles of the present.
   ``As a New Englander, we went through the same kind of pain and
economic distress as you have,'' he said in Greensburg. ``Our
communities have come back and these communities are going to come
back.''
   Drawing on the two weekend debates between the Democrats,
Dukakis talked of how he and Jackson agree on many issues.
   ``Instead of investing in a lot of exotic weapon systems of very
marginal value, we've got to take these resources and put them _ as
both Rev. Jackson and I said Saturday _ into our infrastructure.''
   But on Sunday, Dukakis brushed off suggestions from Jackson that
he should put out a budget.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's
absurd,'' he told reporters on the chartered Amtrak train,
nicknamed the ``Pennsylvania Presidential Unlimited.''
   And Dukakis resisted pressure from a new Jackson tactic, urging
massive new spending on education, drug control efforts and other
programs.
   The front-runner went down his own list of education programs _
which he says involve only modest spending increases _ while
Jackson said the federal government should double its spending on
education.
   ``We're not going to run the nation's school system from
Washington,'' Dukakis said. ``The thing a president has to do is to
set some priorities and get after them.''
   The Democratic candidate also took a couple of swipes at George
Bush, saying that the Republican nominee-to-be seems more
interested in building aircraft carriers than in rebuilding the
nation's railroads and highways.
   ``Mr. Bush was critical of me ... because I oppose spending $36
billion on two supercarrier task forces that we don't need and we
can't afford,'' Dukakis said. ``If he thinks that's where we ought
to put our scarce resources, then so be it. But it's going to be a
fundamental issue in this campaign.
   ``I think I know where the American people are _ they are tired
of crumbling bridges, congested airports, jammed highways, homeless
people on streets and in doorways ... and they want a change.''
   If Dukakis is the Democratic nominee, perhaps he will get a wish
expressed wistfully in Pittsburgh.
   ``All of you know me. I suppose we'd all like to suppose that
I'm a household word,'' he told the small crowd. ``I'd like one of
these days to come to Pittsburgh and hear, `Hey, isn't that
Dukakis?'''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci says
predictions that the Star Wars missile defense system won't work
``are like saying 10 years before we had helicopters that
helicopters were doomed to failure.''
   Carlucci on Sunday defended the administration program to create
a hi-tech space shield against Soviet missiles, saying a panel of
non-government experts believes the system is ``fundamentally
sound.''
   He disputed a report in Sunday's edition of The Washington Post
that quoted an unpublished congressional study as saying the system
would ``suffer a catastrophic failure'' if it were used against a
multiple missile attack from the Soviet Union.
   ``That's about ``like saying 10 years before we had helicopters
that helicopters were doomed to failure,'' Carlucci said in an
interview on ABC-TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   The study was conducted by the Office of Technology Assessment,
a non-partisan scientific arm of Congress.
   Carlucci said he had a panel of non-government technicians and
engineers evaluate Star Wars, and it concluded that ``the program
is fundamentally sound and that we can build a militarily effective
SDI (strategic defense initiative) program, and that is the goal.''
   Carlucci said the Defense Department has been studying the
congressional report, which he described as long and complex, but
he said there has been no official comment on it.
   He said SDI is ``a program that we are currently designing. It
has not even entered the developmental stage, much less the
deployment stage.''
   Meanwhile, the Post reported in Monday's editions that a
high-level Pentagon panel has recommended to Carlucci that he
sharply cut the proposed initial SDI deployment from a system of
space-based weaponry to a less costly and much less effective
system of ground-based rockets.
   Quoting unidentified senior Pentagon officials, the newspaper
said the panel directed by Robert Everett, chairman of the
Pentagon's senior scientific advisory group, has told Carlucci that
such a ground-based defense is worth pursuing as an initial step.
   Last September, then-Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger
approved the acceleration of six SDI programs, the first decision
to push Star Wars technologies from pure research toward
development. The six projects then entered what is known as a
``demonstration and validation'' phase, in which various components
needed for a working system would be tested.
   No decision has been made on which of the six would be the first
deployed.
   The six programs, which had been recommended by the Defense
Acquisition Board, the Pentagon's highest internal review panel,
include:
   _The ground-based surveillance and tracking system, a missile
that could be fired into space to obtain tracking information on
missiles approaching the United States.
   _The space-based surveillance and tracking system, a satellite
system that would be deployed in space to identify and track enemy
missiles.
   _The boost surveillance and tracking system, another type of
orbiting satellite system that would provide an alert if enemy
missiles were launched.
   _The re-entry vehicle interception system, small missiles that
could be fired from the ground to intercept and destroy enemy
missiles during the middle and latter stages of their flight.
   _The space-based interception system, small ``kinetic kill''
rockets on an orbiting platform in space. The rockets could be
fired at enemy missiles shortly after launch and would destroy them
through a direct collision.
   _And the battle management-command, control and communications
system, the ``brains'' of any Star Wars defense. This would consist
of a series of high-powered computers that would be programmed to
select targets and direct weapons against them.
   In the interview Sunday, Carlucci said the Post story on the
report by the Office of Technology Assessment ``took selected
quotes out of that report'' and drew conclusions from them. ``What
you're reading from is some kind of a leaked document,'' he said.
   The Post said it had obtained the report's ``summary chapter.''
   The newspaper said the report shows that detailed computer
instructions needed to destroy thousands of warheads streaking
towards the United States probably cannot ``be produced in the
foreseeable future.''
   The overall conclusion of the report is that, despite five years
and $12 billion worth of scientific research, ``many questions
remain about the feasibility of meeting SDI goals,'' which include
the ability to ward off a Soviet missile attack and eventually
eliminate the threat posed by Soviet missiles.

<HEAD>Prison Inmates Rehabilitate Both Houses And Themselves</HEAD>

   Inmate Dora Teeters used to spend her days at
the Ohio Reformatory for Women in Marysville dreaming about life
outside prison walls.
   She's still serving time for manslaughter, but now she spends
her days in this city 50 miles from prison renovating dilapidated
houses with other inmates. The work is done under the supervision
of trained carpenters, not corrections officers.
   ``It's a nice feeling to be trusted like this,'' she said
recently, sitting on the front stoop of a house she is helping
rebuild. ``It's a good feeling to work with your hands. One day
there's nothing there. Soon, the job is finished and you're proud
of what you've done.''
   Ms. Teeters, 29, who was convicted in 1984, is one of about 120
inmates from the women's reformatory and Lima Correctional
Institution who have worked for Lima's Rehab Project.
   David Berger is the mastermind behind the project, a non-profit
organization founded in 1977 that buys and renovates 15-20
abandoned houses each year. The homes sell for $25,000 to $35,000,
usually to low- and middle-income families.
   Berger started using work-release inmates in 1983 with
minimum-security male prisoners from the Lima prison. That was
interrupted when the state changed the rules for honor inmates,
said Berger, the organization's executive director.
   He called officials at the women's reformatory and they agreed
to participate, marking the first time female inmates were used in
such a project in Ohio.
   ``The whole purpose was to teach fundamentally untrained people
how to build housing,'' he said.
   Under the guidance of the five full-time Rehab Project
employees, the women do all the carpentry work, from gutting to
finishing. They don't do electrical work or plumbing, both licensed
trades, or major excavation or floor covering.
   In the last 11 years, the project has helped rehabilitate 160
houses.
   In his office in an abandoned church, Berger, a former seminary
student, said about 7,000 of Lima's 18,000 houses need extensive
repair. Rehab Project targets houses in different neighborhoods,
hoping others will spruce up their houses themselves.
   When the program began, Rehab Project bought abandoned houses,
bid repair work to contractors and then sold the houses. That
changed in 1979 when the organization became dissatisfied with the
quality of the work and realized it could not recoup the cost of
the extensive repairs needed.
   So for the last nine years, it has used volunteers.
   The program currently uses 20 inmates but has a commitment from
the corrections department to expand to 80. Once in place, those
crews will be able to renovate 30 to 40 houses a year.
   Rehab Project not only allows prisoners freedom to work, it
improves self-esteem and teaches a trade, Berger said.
   ``We have watched teriffic transformations happen with people
who have been out with us; people who had never imagined themselves
doing this kind of work; people who had never had one inkling that
they could be up on a roof, not just working, but somehow knowing
how to install roof shingles, installing furnaces, installing new
dry wall and finish,'' he said.

   It was a typical night at Elaine's, that
ordinary restaurant with the extraordinary clientele: Woody Allen
was at his table. Albert Finney held court at another. Paloma
Picasso stopped by.
   And owner Elaine Kaufman table hopped, playing the amiable host,
the worldly-wise wisecracker, the sounding board to the stars.
   That was Saturday. Tonight is expected to exceed even the starry
standards of Elaine's as friends help celebrate the first
quarter-century of the cluttered Italian restaurant.
   Among those who said they'll be there: actresses Raquel Welch
and Mary Tyler Moore, director Sidney Lumet, developer Donald
Trump, writer Jackie Collins and model Cheryl Tiegs.
   ``This place is a living People magazine,'' said bartender Brian
McDonald.
   Elaine's, a watering hole for writers, a wellspring for gossip
columnists and a favorite target of food critics, remains an
anomaly in the fickle world of Manhattan restaurants.
   It's a friendly-looking place with a reputation, deserved or
not, for rudeness. It has lasted 25 years despite universally bad
reviews.
   And though it is filled with beautiful people, it may seem a
dingy dump to those who know of it only through the gossip columns.
   ``Just a nice, neighborhood restaurant,'' is how Elaine
describes it. ``A good bottle of wine, a nice plate of pasta _ I
mean, that's life.''
   Author Gay Talese, a regular from the start, said, ``There's no
officious maitre d' in black tie, saying, `Wait at the bar while I
see about a table.' Here, you have the bespectacled, stout and
smiling Elaine greeting you and saying, `Of course there's a table
for you.'''
   Of course _ for him. For Talese, that means one of the large
round tables along the right-hand side, Elaine's Wall of Fame, so
to speak. Though it's not true that tables are hard to come by, it
is true that the prominent ones are kept open for the regulars.
Others are shunted to the rear.
   ``I'm afraid you don't get treated very well if you don't have a
pencil in your top pocket,'' said author George Plimpton, whose
colleagues at the Paris Review were among the first regulars.
   A few weeks ago, it was American Literature 103 along the wall:
Talese, Norman Mailer, Kurt Vonnegut, Arthur Miller.
   ``Writers do tend to get together, somewhat like grackles, and
what better telephone wire than the tables at Elaine's?'' said
Plimpton.
   When Elaine plunked down $10,000 for a Hungarian bar in the
unfashionable Yorkville section in 1963, she already knew some show
folk, writers and artists from her days as a waitress and cafe
manager in Greenwich Village.
   ``Actually, what I did was just bring the Village uptown,'' she
said.
   One day, the artist couple Robert Motherwell and Helen
Frankenthaler stopped by, and ``they kept coming in. And they would
bring their friends.''
   Once primarily a writer's haunt, it has become a requisite stop
for celebrities from all walks, from Prince Edward to Prince, Billy
D. Williams to Jackie Mason.
   Allen, who set the opening scene of ``Manhattan'' in Elaine's,
comes because ``he loves to people-watch,'' Elaine said. ``It's
comfortable, nobody bothers him, we make him what he wants.''
   Anyone who wants to spend $3.50 for a bottle of beer can stand
at the bar and people-watch, too, and listen to the stories.
   Like the time Mailer and a lady friend were asked to leave after
arguing with Elaine over whether he could unscrew a light bulb
above their table.
   ``As he got up, he said, `Put the bill on my tab,''' Plimpton
recalled, ``and Elaine said, `You haven't got a tab here, Norman.'
He reached into his pocket and threw a handful of change _ there
was a great clattering of coins on the floor _ and by now it was a
bit of a melee.''
   Mailer vowed never to return, and in fact had his own restaurant
for a while. ``But they always get pulled back, somehow,'' Plimpton
said.

<HEAD>Pravda: Two Years Later, Problems Remain At Chernobyl</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after the Chernobyl power station was
the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident, nepotism, sloppy
repairs and drunkenness are rampant at the facility, Pravda charged.
   The problems cited by the Communist Party daily were similar to
those the government blamed for an explosion and fire at the plant
on April 26, 1986.
   Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the
accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10
years in a labor camp.
   Pravda said on Sunday that during the last two years engineering
jobs at the plant have been handed out to medics, teachers,
veterinarians and people without any higher education.
   It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to ``resolve at
any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant
``to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of
extremely intricate equipment.''
   ``Judging from all this, the leadership ... has not learned a
lesson from the past,'' Pravda said. ``It's as though there hasn't
been an accident.''
   The explosion at the plant 80 miles north of the Ukrainian
capital of Kiev killed 31 people, spewed radiation around the world
and forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living nearby.
   The scathing attack in Pravda was a departure from the numerous
articles appearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary.
   Previous stories have stressed the extensive safety equipment
installed at Chernobyl, improved worker training, the decrease to
safe levels of radiation and the return of people to surrounding
areas.
   Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and
the production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity there
since the accident.
   But then the focus turned to criticism by the Kiev region's
Communist Party committee of ``Kombinat,'' the organization
supervising the plant and cleanup around it.
   Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and
was not tested before being put into service despite serious
defects, the newspaper said.
   Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plant
were not carried out because of Kombinat's negligence, Pravda said.
That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed in
concrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports have
stressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized.
   ``Leadership posts were given to people who had criminal
records, who had been excluded from the party or had received
strict party penalties,'' Pravda said.
   ``Units were headed by people not able to cope with the business
they were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians and
people not having any higher education were working in engineering
posts,'' Pravda said.
   Discipline was slack, the newspaper said.
   ``In the `Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery and
violations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said.
   Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken,
other than to report that Kiev party leaders reprimanded Kombinat's
head, and indicated he had been fired.
   ``E. Ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity in
the evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations of
organizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism,
moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said.
   The article indicated that plant managers tolerated the
shortcomings because of a widespread problem in Soviet industry:
pressure to fulfill a production plan.
   The government has said it must increase the production of
nuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. The
Chernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, has
been ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year.
   Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. V.
Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town for
plant workers near Chernobyl, told a newspaper that sloppy work,
poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to
36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal.
   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl clean-up
commission, denied at a Moscow news conference on Wednesday that
any major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986
explosion.

<HEAD>Labor Party: Voters Will Have Final Say On Peace Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The left-of-center Labor Party adopted a
campaign platform saying Israel will never completely withdraw from
the occupied territories and that voters will be asked to approve
any Middle East peace settlement.
   The platform for November's election appeared to be more
hard-line than the U.S. peace initiative initially backed by Shimon
Peres, the head of the Labor Party and the foreign minister in
Israel's coalition government.
   The platform adopted Sunday apparently was aimed winning over
voters on the right who might consider the party too ``dovish.''
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, meanwhile, told the Cabinet on
Sunday that 1,700 Palestinians, more than one-third of the 4,900
arrested since protests began Dec. 8, were being held without trial
for up to six months.
   Israel media said Rabin also criticized the Justice Ministry
during the Cabinet meeting, saying it was hampering army efforts to
deport more Palestinian agitators. Israel has deported 20
Palestinians to Lebanon since Dec. 8 and ordered the expulsion of
at least four others.
   Also Sunday, the army lifted a four-day ban that had prevented
Arabs in the occupied lands from traveling to Israel. The army also
permitted the delivery of gasoline to the occupied areas for the
first time in more than a month.
   No major clashes were reported between Arabs and Israeli
soldiers in the occupied lands on Sunday.
   The Labor Party platform promised voters a final say, either
through elections or a referendum, on any Middle East peace
settlement, said Labor spokeswoman Michal Cohen.
   The platform, written by Peres, also says Israel will never
withdraw completely from the West Bank and Gaza Strip it captured
in the 1967 Middle East war, Ms. Cohen told The Associated Press.
   It calls on Israel to seek direct negotiations with a
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation, to be preceded by an
international peace conference with strictly ceremonial functions.
The Palestine Liberation Organization would not participate in the
talks.
   A negotiated interim agreement on limited self-rule for the 1.5
million Palestinians in the occupied lands would remain in effect
for up to five years.
   The document also specifies that a final settlement should allow
no Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, preserve all Jewish
settlements there and maintain Jerusalem as the united capital of
Israel.
   It says areas with a high percentage of Arab residents may be
turned over to Palestinian-Jordanian control.
   These specifics in the platform go beyond the U.S. peace
initiative, which do not dictate any such terms. The section on
settlements remaining intact presumably would conflict with the
views of the American government, which has consistently urged
limiting Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.
   Peres' call for giving Israeli voters a final say on any peace
plan has not been stated before. The U.S. peace initiative also has
never directly said that any international peace conference would
be strictly ceremonial in function.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir head of the right-wing Likud bloc
said on Sunday that Israel would ``never part with the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.'' In a speech to the central committee of his Herut
Party, Shamir also suggested that gradual and limited Palestinian
self-rule was as far as he was willing to go.
   Labor and Likud are in the fourth year of a fragile coalition.
Peres and Shamir traded jobs in October 1987.
   Also Sunday, the Defense Ministry asked the Finance Ministry for
an additional $162 million to cover the cost of combating the Arab
uprising, said spokesman Eitan Haber. He would not elaborate, and
it was not immediately clear if that sum represented all the money
the ministry has spent in connection with the uprising since Dec.
8, or only a part of it.
   Last month, the Economics Ministry said the uprising has cost
Israel $312 million in lost production, lost exports and added
security costs.
   Rabin also said 165 Palestinians have been killed in the
uprising, including 147 by the army. According to U.N. figures, the
Palestinian death toll has reached 173. An Israeli soldier and
Jewish settler also have died.

   Tokyo share prices rose across the board today and
the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at a record high while the dollar
stayed stable throughout the day.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues in the Tokyo Stock
Exchange gained 155.08 points from Saturday's closing to end the
day at 27,213.45, the highest level for the market's main index.
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 125
yen, up 0.35 yen from Friday's close of 124.65 yen. It had opened
the day at 125.05 yen.
   ``Share prices, including large-capital issues such as steels,
are faring well'' as investors were buoyed by the strength of the
Japanese economy, said Masahiro Umemori of Nomura Securities.
   He said some investors were awaiting first-quarter figures on
the U.S. gross national product, scheduled to be announced in
Washington Tuesday.
   A foreign exchange dealer at a Japanese commercial bank said
morning trading on the dollar was very slow because investors were
waiting for the U.S. GNP figures. Speaking on condition of
ananymity, he said slow trading was expected throughout the week as
Japan enters a major holiday season next week.

   President Roh Tae-woo's government is
battling to win crucial legislative elections and overcome
revelations of high-level corruption and widespread public distrust.
   The governing Democratic Justice Party is expected to win the
largest number of seats in Tuesday's National Assembly election,
but it may have trouble retaining its majority. Government failure
to keep control would be a major boost for the opposition.
   Roh, who began a five-year term in February, says the government
must retain control of the assembly to keep its promises of
sweeping democratic, social and economic reform. He accused the
opposition of dividing the nation and fomenting unrest.
   ``I still believe that the history of hate and darkness can
never be resolved through revenge and that love and reconciliation
are the only cures,'' Roh said during the campaign.
   Surveys by leading South Korean newspapers indicate the
governing party may fall short of its goal of winning 125 of the
224 assembly seats to be decided by voting. The surveys indicate it
was assured of about 65 seats and was neck-and-neck in about 80
other districts.
   The assembly's remaining 75 seats will be divided on the basis
of how many votes each party gets. The assembly's power was
increased by a new constitution and the president can no longer
dissolve it.
   But the rival opposition parties have repeatedly failed to unite
against the government and they are seen as having little chance of
winning. The rival parties depend largely on regional support.
   Many opposition supporters are disillusioned by the disunity and
squabbling for power between main opposition leaders Kim Young-sam
and Kim Dae-jung. They drew a combined 55 percent in December's
presidential race, but their individual candidacies both trailed
Roh's 36 percent plurality.
   The two Kims symbolically resigned after the loss, but remain in
control of their parties.
   The opposition has tried to discredit Roh and his party with a
corruption scandal involving former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was charged on March 31
with embezzling a fortune in cash, stocks and land while he headed
the semi-official Saemaul development program. A government probe
uncovered extortion, influence peddling and theft.
   Kim Young-sam's Reunification Democratic Party and Kim
Dae-jung's Party for Peace and Democracy claim the government has
exposed only part of the corruption. Opposition leaders allege Roh
and other top leaders helped cover up corruption when they served
under the Chun administration.
   Kim Young-sam told a rally, ``The DJP's call for overwhelming
support for what they describe as social stability is nothing but a
clear-cut expression of its determination to prolong rule by
military officers tainted by political interests.''
   The government has fought back by insisting the issue was raised
because of Roh's promise during the presidential campaign to expose
corruption under his predecessor.
   South Korea has experienced significant political liberalization
since last summer and most controls on political activity have been
dismantled. Roh has promised full democracy as quickly as possible.
   But Roh has not won broad public acceptance. Many Koreans are
distrustful of Roh as a former general who helped put Chun in power
with military backing in 1980. Roh has attempted to cut his ties to
Chun and his authoritarian rule.
   Chun, who hoped to retain some power, was forced to give up his
remaining posts as a result of the corruption affair and his
hard-line loyalists in the party were purged.
   Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets last June in
massive protests against the Chun government. Roh backed opposition
demands for elections at the height of the violence.
   Electioneering for the National Assembly has been restricted by
limits on the number of rallies and bans on most forms of street
campaigning.
   ``A uniquely lackluster atmosphere prevailed in stumping
rallies,'' The Korea Herald reported in an analysis.
   Candidates from all the parties have wooed voters with cash,
meals, day trips and other gifts that are a customary part of
electioneering. Newspapers calcuate millions of dollars have been
spent.
   Scattered violent clashes between rival supporters have marred
some rallies and the government warned it would not tolerate
unrest. But the campaigning has been far less violent than in last
year's presidential election.
   ``The politicians should not disappoint the people of this
nation anymore,'' said political analyst Rhee Chong-ik.

   After a day of sightseeing and socializing,
newspaper executives from across the country settle in today to
discuss the industry at the 102nd annual convention of the American
Newspaper Publishers Association.
   More than 2,000 people were expected at the convention,
including more than 1,000 newspaper publishers who represent 90
percent of the nation's daily newspaper circulation.
   Sunday was set aside for registration and sightseeing, with a
two-mile fun run and a tour of the USS Arizona Memorial and Pearl
Harbor among the activities.
   But today the business was beginning. Besides hearing from
experts within the industry and newsmakers covered by it, ANPA
members were to elect officers and directors to the group's
22-member board.
   Among the speakers scheduled at the three-day convention were
Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Garry Trudeau; Juan Bautista

correspondents from Nicaragua, South Korea, the Soviet Union,
Israel and the White House were to share their experiences.
   In keeping with the Hawaiian setting, several of the ANPA
convention's panels feature issues especially important here,
including foreign trade and investment and the future of the United
States' relations with Asia.
   A special panel on the status of minority journalists also was
scheduled, as well as one called ``AIDS and the Workplace.''
   On Wednesday, the ANPA will hold its annual business meeting,
with George W. Wilson, chairman of the ANPA and president of the
Concord (N.H.) Monitor, presiding. The ANPA membership will elect
officers and members of the board of directors at the meeting.

   The first round of the presidential election was a
historic moment for two political parties. The far-right National
Front achieved unprecedented support, and the Communist Party
tumbled to an all-time low.
   Perhaps most important for the future of France was the 14.5
percent won by Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the National Front.
The party has emerged as a significant new force in French
politiics with its strident anti-immigrant, ``French first''
campaign.
   ``Nothing ever again will be done in France without the voters
of the National Front,'' exulted Le Pen, 59, after the results
became clear in Sunday's election. He said there has been a
``radical transformation of the national (political) landscape.''
   Premier Jacques Chirac, who will face Socialist President
Francois Mitterrand in the May 8 runoff, won only 19.9 percent of
the vote and desperately needs National Front support if he is to
have any chance of overtaking the president, who scored 33.9
percent.
   Chirac has vowed he will not do a deal with Le Pen for his
backing, but he may have no choice but to do so despite the nearly
universal condemnation it will bring him. Le Pen says his
instructions to his voters will depend on what Chirac says and does
in the coming week.
   While Le Pen's performance was a surprise, well above the 10
percent to 12 percent he had been accorded in pre-election opinion
polls, the 6.8 percent won by Andre Lajoinie, the official
Communist candidate, was predictable and confirmed the steady
decline that began in 1981.
   The stodgy, tightly structured Communist Party has been losing
members for a decade, essentially because it has failed to adapt
its language to a changing French society which is better educated,
more sophisticated and less doctrinaire.
   The Communists were hampered by the candidacy of Pierre Juquin,
leader of a splinter reformist movement who won 2.1 percent.
   The poor showing of the official Communist candidate could lead
to further internal party dissension of the sort that led to the
rebellion by Juquin and others over the past four years.
   The Communist Party, which once was the major force on the
French left accounting for more than a quarter of the vote, began
to fall significantly with the 1981 presidential election when
party Secretary General Georges Marchais won only 15.3 percent of
the vote.
   That fell to 11.3 percent in the 1984 election for the European
Parliament and 9.8 percent in the 1986 National Assembly election.
   Sunday's score was the lowest registered by the French Communist
Party in a national election since the party was founded in 1920.
The previous low was 8.4 percent in the 1932 legislative vote.
   In the 1974 presidential election, Le Pen won a minuscule 0.7
percent. In 1981, he was not even able to gather the 500 signatures
of elected officials necessary to get on the ballot.
   But in 1984, the National Front, thoroughly vilified by all of
the traditional parties, nearly equaled the Communists in the
European vote with 11 percent and matched them in the 1986
legislatives with 9.8.
   Bruno Megret, Le Pen's campaign manager, called 1988 ``a major
turning point in the political history of our country.''
   Francois Bachelot, a National Front deputy in Parliament, said
the score was ``not just the most remarkable event of the first
round of the presidential elections, it is the essential political
event of the post-war period.''
   The combined vote of Chirac, head of the conservative Rally for
the Republic party, and former Premier Raymond Barre, supported by
the center-right Union for French Democracy, totaled less than 37
percent, a serious setback for the traditional rightist parties.
   Though Chirac rejects making overtures to the National Front, he
boldly addressed Le Pen's favorite themes in a short television
appearance after the election was over.
   He appealed to ``all those who want security to be assured, and
delinquence, criminality and terrorism to be fought with all
necessary firmness, our national identifity to be preserved and
clandestine immigration also to be fought...''
   Political analysts generally agreed that Le Pen's newfound
support was based as much on a widespread dissatisfaction with
traditional parties as his anti-immigration and law-and-order
stands.
   ``I am a little ashamed for France that a man like Le Pen ...
has won 4 million votes,'' said Marchais. ``That poses a problem
for me and that poses a problem for my country. He has taken votes
from the working-class electorate.''
   He added that France had ``no reason to be proud'' of a man
whose policy is ``founded on racism.''
   Lajoinie stressed that he ``waged my campaign not to be elected,
but to affirm demands for new policies.'' He added: ``In that
context is is obvious that the real influence of the French
Communist Party goes very far beyond the results that we registered
today.''

<TEXT>
   Your county government spends an average $426
apiece to provide each of its residents with public services,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
   And the largest counties spend even more.
   A survey of county governments released Sunday found spending by
counties averaged $426.22 per resident nationwide in the 1985-86
fiscal year.
   But counties with populations of 500,000 or more spent an
average of $503.99 per resident, while counties of fewer than
100,000 spent $383.12 per resident, the report found.
   Seven counties spent more than $1,000 per resident to provide
services, the Census Bureau noted. They were lead by Montgomery
County, Md. which spent $1,684 per resident.
   While education generally is a small share of most county
governments per resident spending, the report found it made up as
much as half of the spending for the four counties with the largest
per capita expenditures.

<HEAD>Government Economist Sees Big Economic, Pleasure Loss In Smaller</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Cars
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government economist says it would be less
costly to the U.S. economy to add a gasoline tax of 2 or 3 cents
than to steer car buyers away from purchasing big cars.
   Andrew N. Kleit, a member of the Federal Trade Commission staff,
says the U.S. economy would lose $4.80 for every gallon of gas
saved in dissuading people from buying big cars while just as much
fuel would be saved by an additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3
cents a gallon.
   ``People clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and I don't
see anything illicit in that at all,'' Kleit said in an interview
about his report, ``The Impact of Automobile Fuel Economy
Standards.'' He said the report represents his own views and not
those of the FTC' Bureau of Economics which published it as Working
Paper No. 160.
   Current Transportation Department standards require
manufacturers to meet a 26 mpg fuel efficiency standard. But that
standard will increase to 27.5 mpg for the 1989 model year unless
the department acts to make changes.
   The lower standards, imposed in 1975, were meant as a
fuel-saving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or imported crude
oil. But environmentalists who want to see less fossil fuel burned
support the higher standards.
   But opponents of the higher standards, including auto safety
proponents, estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989
cars could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decade
because the large cars people might be discouraged from buying are
generally considered safer than small ones.

<HEAD>Report: States Should Provide Prenatal Care For Poor Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee says it is costing the
government three to 10 times more to provide neonatal intensive
care and other health and education expenses for babies born
prematurely than it would to provide care for pregnant women with
incomes below the federal poverty level who have those babies.
   And the panel, the House Government Operations Committee,
recommended Sunday that states be required to provide prenatal
health care to prevent premature births.
   The committee said only 26 states are currently taking advantage
of a two-year-old option to extend Medicaid to all pregnant women
with incomes below the federal poverty level.
   ``Since the majority of women below the poverty line cannot
possibly afford health insurance, it is necessary to require
Medicaid coverage for pregnant women below the federal poverty
line,'' the report said.
   Citing various studies, the report said professional prenatal
care, not including labor and delivery fees, costs about $400,
while the lifetime cost of health and custodial care for a
low-birthweight handicapped infant can amount to 100 times that
much.
   About 40,000 U.S. infants born each year die before their first
birthday, a rate higher than many other industrialized nations.

<HEAD>Report Says Sexual Harassment of Women in Marines Still a Problem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A task force report says it's up to the Marine
Corps commandant to set the tone that will help remedy continuing
sexual harassment of women in the corps.
   The report released Sunday said existing directives and the
corps' primary grievance system are ``appropriate tools to
implement Marine Corps policy on this issue'' but emphasized that
the commandant must convey that sexual harassment will not be
tolerated in the service.
   The Task Force on Women in the Marine Corps, formed in September
1987 at the request of then-Secretary of Navy James Webb, also said
the corps did not have a ``significant problem'' with
fraternization.
   The report recommended certain steps to improve the quality of
life for female Marines, including solving the problem of shortage
in uniform items and lengthy delays in filling special orders,
ensuring full investigation when homosexual conduct is suspected
and allowing a pregnant Marine to request a 30-day delay in the
notification of her commander by the medical officer.
   Women account for about 10 percent of the nation's 2.1 million
military personnel.

<HEAD>Israel, US Company Push For Export Permit For Air-Launched Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. defense contractor and the Israeli
government are trying to get the State Department to grant the
company an export license so it can aid Israel in designing an
air-launched armor-seeking eapon system.
   But U.S. officials have refused to issue the company the
necessary license because they say the system would violate a
six-year ban on the sale of ``cluster bomb'' technology to Israel.
   In the memo from C.R. Bergwin, director of export license
administration for United Technologies to under secretary of state
for security assistance, science and technology the company argues
that the ban should not apply to the $50 million contract.
   ``In order that we may proceed with the program, we urgently
require an interpretation that the U.S. government's cluster
munition policy does not apply to our contract,'' Bergwin wrote.
   He said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed at
cluster bombs designed to be used against people, not against tanks
and armored vehicles.
   The White House imposed the cluster bomb ban on Israel in 1982
after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by Israel
against civilians during its invasion of Lebanon, an apparent
violation of assurances Israel had previously given U.S. officials.

<TEXT>
   Kiev residents who get a mysterious ache or pain
are apt to grasp for the easy explanation _ radiation from
Chernobyl.
   Such is one of the lingering scars of the world's worst nuclear
accident: a fear of what long-term health problems will result from
the explosion and fire two years ago at the Chernobyl nuclear
plant, 80 miles north of Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.
   A Kiev resident, speaking during a Moscow visit on condition of
anonymity, said some people blame everything from headaches to
toothaches on radiation from Chernobyl. This is despite the
government's repeated assurances that radiation levels in the
region are normal and safe.
   Doctors in accident-affected regions are spending most of their
time ``combating radiophobia,'' the government newspaper Izvestia
reported in February.
   A Soviet pediatrician said last August that more than 2,000
healthy children were born to mothers who lived around Chernobyl
during the April 26, 1986 disaster, which killed 31 people and
spewed a cloud of radioactivity worldwide.
   But an American doctor who treated some Chernobyl victims,
Robert Gale, wrote April 1 in Pravda that the accident's long-term
effects cannot be predicted. He guessed that problems could include
birth defects, genetic deviations and an additional 6,000 cancer
victims in the next 50 to 70 years.
   Although a Pravda report on Sunday criticized nepotism,
drunkenness and sloppy repairs at the plant, other reports marking
the disaster's second anniversary portray life returning to normal.
   They say Chernobyl's reactors are generating electricity again
and people are living nearby in once dangerously radioactive areas.
   But the fear of nuclear power remains.
   Taking advantage of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign for ``glasnost,'' or more openness on some issues, nuclear
power opponents have been speaking out and in some cases halting
construction of new nuclear plants.
   ``Who will say that each of these atomic power stations, built
or planned, does not conceal another potential Chernobyl?''
Ukrainian writer Oles Honchar asked at a conference last October.
   The government's answer: ``One can say now with confidence that
even a recurrence of the errors which were made in Chernobyl would
not lead to such a disaster,'' Nuclear Power Minister Nikolai
Lukonin told the Soviet news agency Tass last week.
   Officials say the public's fears are unjustified. Plans call for
doubling by 1990 the amount of electricity generated by nuclear
plants from the 1985 level of 28 million kilowatts.
   Part of the increased production is from the Chernobyl plant
itself.
   But the resumed production reportedly is not without its costs.
   V. Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town
for plant workers 35 miles from Chernobyl, said last December that
sloppy work, poor discipline and safety violations at the plant
contributed to 36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them
fatal.
   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl clean-up
commission, denied at a news conference last week that any major
accident had occurred at the plant since the 1986 explosion.
   Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the
accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10
years in a labor camp. The government blamed the accident on human
error in shutting down safety systems to conduct unauthorized
experiments.
   In January, the ruling Politburo put the accident's cost at
$13.8 billion.
   Another price paid was in people's shaken faith in the
government's ability to harness nuclear energy safely. The
newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said nuclear plants once lent
prestige to a city, ``but that was before Chernobyl.''
   Popular opposition has prevented building two nuclear plants
near the Ukrainian city of Odessa and the Byelorussian capital of
Minsk.
   Construction of a nuclear plant in the Russian city of Krasnodar
was halted because residents complained it was in an
earthquake-prone area and too close to a nature preserve.
   Public complaints appear to have been at least partly behind the
government's May 1987 decision to stop building two additional
reactors at Chernobyl.
   Thirty Ukrainian scientists, writing Jan. 21 in the newspaper
Literaturnaya Ukraina, criticized on ecological grounds the
government's plans to add reactors to three other plants. They
accused the government of ignoring the ``bitter lessons of
Chernobyl.''

   Political rivals have staged scattered
attacks with fists, rocks and firebombs, injuring scores of people
in the 18-day campaign for Tuesday's National Assembly elections.
   Exact injury figures were not available, but as of today, police
reported 87 cases of election-related violence nationwide, with 140
people detained and 77 of them formally charged so far.
   On election eve, an opposition party accused police themselves
and governing party members of beating up about a dozen ranking
opposition members in a dispute over campaign tactics.
   Firebombs and rocks have been thrown at campaign rallies and at
political party offices, and rival supporters have clashed over
such things as the content of campaign leaflets and the placement
or removal of posters.
   Anti-government students shouting ``Down with the military
dictatorship!'' have hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police,
although student protests are a regular feature in South Korea.
   On Sunday, police said they arrested four students in the
southeastern city of Taegu for allegedly throwing a firebomb at a
governing party candidate as he spoke at a rally. No one was
reported injured.
   Yun Il-yung, chairman of the Central Election Management
Committee, expressed his regret in a statement today over
corruption and violence in what he called an overheated campaign.
   In a news conference in Pusan today, opposition leader Kim
Young-sam called the government a ``gangster regime,'' saying it
was resorting to violence to try to win Tuesday's election.
   He charged that governing party workers had beaten up or
kidnapped eight people in Pusan, including the son of his fellow
Reunification Democratic Party candidate Kim Kwang-il.
   Kim Young-sam said the governing Democratic Justice Party had
organized about 100 gangs in each election district to intimidate
opposition members.
   In Seoul, Reunification Democratic Party spokesman charged in a
statement that police and governing party members beat up a dozen
Reunification Democratic Party members when 30 opposition members,
including some candidates, went to a police station on Sunday to
protest the detention of student volunteer campaign workers for
allegedly pasting opposition stickers on governing party posters.
   Last Thursday, in his first news conference since taking office
in February, President Roh Tae-woo accused the opposition parties
of fomenting unrest. In a warning to both sides, he said: ``Whoever
violates the law and destroys democratic order must be punished
severely in the name of the people.''
   Tens of thousands of police in full riot gear turned out to
guard nearly 170 joint campaign rallies over the weekend that
marked the end of major campaign activity.
   Today, campaign rules barred candidates from speeches or
house-to-house visits, but handing out of leaflets still was
permitted.
   Press reports said 20 governing party members beat up six
supporters of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and
Democracy early today in Haenam, south of Kwangju, and 70 Party for
Peace and Democracy members retaliated by throwing firebombs and
rocks at a district governing party office, injuring two of its
members.
   In Chongsong, south of Seoul, police today said they were
looking for five governing party members on charges of breaking
into a district office of the New Democratic Republican Party and
beating up candidate Nam Sang-kul and three other people.
   There also were press reports in Seoul of opposition party
members seizing governing party members, claiming they were
distributing leaflets that slandered opposition candidates.
   Police reported detaining 173 people throughout the country in
connection with non-violent election law violations, and formally
charging 120 of them.
   The cases have involved tearing or pasting over election posters
and allegedly slanderous campaign leaflets.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz received an award
from a gun club federation, then sarcastically ``thanked'' the four
young men he shot in December 1984 for helping him through his
legal battles.
   In a rare public appearance, Goetz on Sunday thanked each of the
four by name for foibles that he felt helped him to be acquitted on
attempted murder and assault charges.
   Goetz was convicted last year of lesser gun possession charges.
He is free on bail pending an appeal.
   In remarks before the Federation of New York State Rifle and
Pistol Clubs, Goetz thanked Barry Allen ``for robbing someone in
the apartment building where he lived.''
   He thanked Darrell Cabey ``for his revealing interview with
(columnist) Jimmy Breslin'' in which Cabey recounted the subway
shooting.
   Goetz thanked Troy Canty for his sometimes inconsistent
testimony and thanked James Ramseur ``for committing a tacky rape
and kidnapping'' and for his surly and uncooperative behavior in
the courtroom.
   The award the gun club gave Goetz goes annually to someone who
uses deadly force ``when reasonably necessary,'' according to
federation President Jerry Preiser.
   Preiser said the federation, which previously raised $10,000 for
Goetz's legal defense fund, raised $3,000 more for him Sunday and
hopes to raise $7,000 to $10,000 from mail solicitations.

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand has distanced himself
from the modern French Socialist Party he founded and projected a
new centrist image in his effort to defeat conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac in the May 8 runoff.
   Mitterrand is very much an insider in French politics despite
his leftist label. The bald, avuncular incumbent is a veteran of
four presidential elections, has held many Cabinet posts and enjoys
one of the highest status symbols in French society as a former
fighter in the World War II resistance.
   Mitterrand, 71, was first elected May 10, 1981, in a Socialist
tidal wave that ousted center-right President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing. A month later, the same tide pushed out conservatives
and centrists who had held power in the National Assembly for 23
years.
   Mitterrand also has known presidential defeat. He was beaten by
Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1965 and by Giscard in 1974.
   But from 1981 to 1986, Mitterrand and his Socialists wielded
political control in France.
   That ended in the March 1986 legislative elections, when voters
returned rightists to power in the National Assembly, creating for
two years what the French call ``cohabitation.''
   The Socialists' early free-spending policies were abruptly
reversed and stiff austerity measures instituted. High unemployment
also dragged down the president's popularity to as low as 27
percent at midterm.
   With the Socialist legislative defeat in 1986, Mitterrand began
to take on a new face.
   He slipped into the role of elder statesman, developing an image
as the wise grandfather above the day-to-day battles of governing.
He distanced himself from his party, abandoned revolutionary
rhetoric, and began to reach out to the political center.
   His popularity soared again, consistently reaching an approval
rate of 55 percent or more.
   Mitterrand was born Oct. 26, 1916, in Jarnac in western France.
He earned degrees in law and letters in Paris. He was drafted in
1938 and shot and captured during the German invasion of May 1940.
   Escaping from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany, he returned to
France. The Germans were occupying the Vichy zone of France, and
Mitterrand helped create a resistance network.
   His career-long feud with de Gaulle began during the war when
Mitterrand refused to merge his resistance group with de Gaulle's.
   It was also during his resistance days that he met Danielle
Gouze, whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation.
   During the chaotic post-war Fourth Republic, Mitterrand held 11
Cabinet posts, including interior and justice minister.
   In the early 1970s, Mitterrand took the moribund Socialist Party
and built it into a major force. But the Union of the Left he
forged with the Communists fell apart in 1977.
   It was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential
election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat
Giscard and oust the conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the West when he brought Communists
into his government. But that new union lasted only until 1984 when
the Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.

   Whatever artist Andy Warhol touched during his
lifetime _ from brightly painted cookie jars to a 1974 Rolls Royce
_ seems to have turned to gold by frenzied bidding at an auction of
his collection of art and kitsch.
   During the first two days of the 10-day sale, jewelry, furniture
and decorations owned by the late artist fetched $6,222,892, said
Diana Levitt, a spokeswoman for Sotheby's, the auction house.
   On Sunday, a pair of pottery cookie jars depicting a black chef
and a black woman sold for $23,100 _ about 200 times their
estimated price.
   ``The interest in the Warhol collection is very high and we're
looking forward to eight more days of Warhol interest and
excitement,'' she said.
   Saturday's sale, featuring art nouveau and art deco pieces,
brought in $5,314,347, more than double what had been expected. On
Sunday, the bidding produced a total of $907,995, three times more
than estimated, according to Ms. Levitt.
   Warhol's collection of paintings, drawings and sculpture _ from
19th century landscapes and portraits to a 1977 collage on paper by
Robert Rauschenberg _ was scheduled to go on the block today.
   People lined up around the block Sunday to get into Sotheby's,
and more than 1,000 packed the auction room during 4{ hours of
bidding, said Ms. Levitt.
   The highest bid was $77,000 by a Beverly Hills collector for a
Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow sedan, which had a presale estimate of
$15,000 to $20,000, she said.
   The 175 cookie jars on sale, projected to bring in $5,000 to
$7,000, fetched $247,000, Ms. Levitt said.
   ``I think people felt they were interesting, appealing, amusing,
whimsical,'' said Ms. Levitt. ``And the Warhol factor was certainly
at work in achieving these prices.''
   About 150 of the cookie jars were bought by Gedalio Grinberg,
chairman of Movado Watches, which has developed a Warhol watch that
will be sold starting in September, she added.
   Among the other sale items was a group of unmounted semiprecious
stones, mostly quartz, which sold for $10,000 _ 10 times the
presale estimate.
   When a large golden hair ornament went for $1,300, auctioneer
David Redden commented, ``Something actually sold in the
estimates.''
   A series of John Lennon lithographs, signed in pencil by the
late ex-Beatle, sold for $10,450, just over the presale estimate of
$7,000 to $9,000. The lithographs depict Lennon's marriage to Yoko
Ono and their honeymoon.
   A director's chair with Warhol's name on the back sold for
$6,050. It was expected to bring only $100 to $150.
   Warhol's collection of American classical and federal furniture,
called by Sotheby's the largest and most important available for
auction in years, will be sold Tuesday.
   Before the sale began, Sotheby's expected the entire collection
to sell for $10 million to $15 million. Levitt said the high prices
were attributable ``to some degree (to) the Warhol factor, but to a
great degree the quality and rarity of the objects.''
   More than 10,000 items, including paintings, rare art deco
furniture, watches, clocks and photographs, are included in one of
the most extensive sales ever held by Sotheby's in New York.
   Proceeds will benefit the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual
Arts, which will award grants to cultural institutions in the
United States and abroad. Warhol died at age 58 last year.

<HEAD>Jewish Students Protest Un-kosher Brandeis Menu</HEAD>

   A group of Brandeis University students
has turned the addition of pork and shellfish to the student menu
into a debate on the institution's Jewish origins.
   About 55 students demonstrated Sunday against the menu items
that go against kosher dietary laws. Protesters said shellfish and
pork symbolized a desire by Brandeis officials to pull away from
the Jewish identity of the 40-year-old university.
   The protesters in turn faced a counter-demonstration by students
who said the anti-pork faction was exhibiting a hostility toward
non-Jews that has damaged Brandeis' reputation in the past.
   ``Brandeis and the administration is backing away from its
Jewish pride,'' said protest organizer Stuart Kolisky.
   Claudia Salomon agreed, saying ``Brandeis needs to retain that
Jewish quality. It should be a diverse community, but it should
know that it has a Jewish character.''
   Michelle Tankin, who also is Jewish, engaged several of the
protesters in a heated argument. ``What you're trying to do is
apply laws to people who aren't kosher,'' she said.
   Student Adam Whitehead held a small sign with the message:
``Don't discriminate against freedom to choose.''
   Brandeis is officially non-sectarian, but about 60 percent of
the 2,800 undergraduate enrollment is Jewish. The university has
long offered non-kosher foods, such as dishes that mix dairy
products and meat.
   The university's board has no plans to change the pork and
shellfish policy, said Sallie Riggs, spokeswoman for Brandeis.
   ``Many of the comments that were made are either one-sided or
half the truth,'' Riggs said of the demonstrators. She said about
300 students are on the university's kosher food plan and have a
separate and newly expanded cafeteria.
   Riggs said the menu additions stemmed from a report by the
university's board last year on a range of issues. Among them was a
desire to offer a menu compatible to all types of students. For
example, shellfish and pork are major parts of the diet of Asians,
Riggs said.
   One section of the report was titled, ``A return to the
historical non-sectarian emphasis of the university,'' Riggs said.
The report reflected the board's concern that the university was
perceived as a Jewish school.
   ``It is not a religious school. It's not a Jewish school. It's a
non-sectarian university,'' Riggs said.
   American studies Professor Jacob Cohen supported the protest but
acknowledged to the gathering, ``this is very often, and you know
it, a hostile and clannish and unfriendly place for those who are
non-Jewish.''
   Still, Cohen said it was as important to avoid alienating Jews
who observe kosher laws. Cohen called the new food policy, ``a
statement by Brandeis: `I'm a little bit ashamed of being Jewish.'

   A 17-month-old boy was hit by a
train as he crawled on railroad tracks near his home, authorities
said.
   Jeremy Lee Gerard, son of Ronald L. and Pamela Gerard of this
rural south-central Illinois community, was pronounced dead at the
scene Sunday, said Fayette County Coroner Angie May-Bolin.
   State police said the baby was hit as he crawled toward a
westbound Conrail mail train that was traveling about 70 mph. The
train, with three engines and 35 cars, was en route from
Plainfield, Ind., to St. Louis, state police said.
   Engineer Thomas B. Bridgegroom, 47, of Danville, Ind.,
apparently applied the brakes when he saw the baby, said Deputy
Coroner Jesse Miller.
   State's Attorney Don Sheafor refused to say much about the case
other than, ``It appears the child was outside unsupervised.''
   He said he did not know why the child was near the tracks, which
are south of the family home.
   The death remained under investigation, he said.

   An explosion and fire ripped through a paint
store late Sunday and spread to four other buildings, injuring
three people, authorities said.
   The fire broke out at 11:15 p.m. and continued burning out of
control more than two hours later. Four buildings were engulfed in
flames when all off-duty firefighters were called in to staff
stations.
   After the explosion in the paint store, the blaze spread to
apartments upstairs, and to a tavern and brewery housed in a
converted bowling alley on the city's east side, fire officials
said.
   The building with the paint store was destroyed.
   Eight of the 12 people who lived in the building were initially
unaccounted for early Monday, said Dr. Jeffrey Jentzen, Milwaukee
County Medical Examiner.
   Later, police Lt. Donald Domagaleski said all were accounted for.
   The three injured were taken to a hospital, police said. No
information on their conditions was immediately available.

   An estimated $42 million was raised for the
March of Dimes by more than 600,000 Americans to fight birth
defects.
   Walkers in more than 1,300 communities marched an average of
15.5 to 18.6 miles in ``walkathons'' on Saturday or Sunday,
according to Marcia Stein, a spokeswoman for the organization.
   The walkers solicited pledges from friends, neighbors and
colleagues, who promised to pay them for each mile walked. The
money will be used to combat birth defects nationwide through
research, education and health services, Ms. Stein said.
   Pledges were up 5 percent over 1987. ``All indications are that
this year's walk will set a new record,'' March of Dimes President
Charles Massey said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   Premier Jacques Chirac, an energetic leader and a
tireless campaigner, will need to draw on those traits as he fights
what is expected to be an uphill battle in next month's runoff
presidential election.
   The neo-Gaullist, who has been head of the government for two
years, finished second in the first round of the election on
Sunday, receiving 20 percent of the vote compared to 34 percent for
President Francois Mitterrand.
   When Chirac faces Mitterrand in the May 8 runoff, the
conservative premier will be challenging the president who
appointed him. One poll released Sunday predicted Mitterrand will
win the runoff with 55 percent of the vote.
   By finishing second Sunday, Chirac improved on his first
presidential run seven years ago. He lost out in the first round in
1981, finishing third behind former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing and Mitterrand.
   Chirac became premier in March 1986 when the conservatives
ousted the Socialists from control of the National Assembly in
legislative elections. He then formed the new Cabinet and was
formally named premier by Mitterrand.
   Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic is the largest
party in the center-right government coalition. The energetic
premier has at various times been compared to a bulldozer, a
computer and a robot.
   While Chirac's immense energy and ability to make tough
decisions rapidly is considered a key asset, critics consider it a
liability. There are those who feel he is too impulsive to be
president.
   Chirac is simple in his tastes and acknowledges he likes Western
movies, detective novels, gin rummy and a good glass of beer. He is
the champion of a liberalized free-market economy.
   Chirac was born Nov. 29, 1932, in Paris. He was educated in the
capital, except during World War II period, and spent most of his
holidays at the family's country home in the south-central Correze
region.
   After graduating from the Institute for Political Studies in
Paris, he fought as a lieutenant in the Algerian War. He completed
his studies at the National School for Administration, whose
graduates are destined for the top ranks of the civil service.
   A frequent visitor to the United States, Chirac hitchiked around
America as a youth, working for a time as a fountain clerk at a
Howard Johnson restaurant. He was a protege of the late President
Georges Pompidou, who referred to him as ``my bulldozer.''
   Chirac won his first election in 1967 _ a seat in the National
Assembly from the Correze district. He became a secretary of state
in the Finance Ministry, then moved on to be minister for relations
with Parliament, agriculture minister and interior minister.
   In 1974, at the age of 41, he became premier for the first time
under Giscard d'Estaing.
   Chirac resigned after two years, complaining of a lack of
authority and disagreement over economic policy. In 1977 he was
elected mayor of Paris, a post he continues to hold.
   Instead of supporting Giscard d'Estaing in the runoff against
Mitterrand in the 1981 election, Chirac told his supporters to vote
their conscience, a move believed to have contributed to Giscard
d'Estaing's defeat and a source of bitterness between the centrists
and conservatives.

   About 1,800 people in three East
Tennessee communities and a nearby Georgia town were allowed to
return home after a cloud from a toxic chemical leak dissipated,
officials said.
   Tennessee Chemical Company workers were searching for the cause
of Sunday's leak.
   About 1.1 tons of sulfur trioxide leaked from an indoor tank
into a building at the company, said Carolyn Merritt, plant
environmental manager. She said it wasn't known how much escaped
from the building.
   Residents of Copperhill, Newtown and Coletown, Tenn., and
McCaysville, Ga., were advised late Sunday that it was safe to
return home, said James Francis, operations director for the
Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
   Francis and Merritt said they knew of no injuries, but
McCaysville Fire Chief William Wright said some evacuees there
reported burning eyes and itchy throats and feelings of nausea.
   The chemical, which forms sulfuric acid when combined with
moisture, is manufactured at the plant for use in making products
such as detergent, Merritt said.

   The old issues were blurred with ambivalence for
some of the '60's revolutionaries who grappled with their past
during a reunion at Columbia University.
   The adrenaline surge they remembered from the former struggle
has been tempered by wistfulness, perhaps, because the dream didn't
last.
   ``It didn't just die; it was profoundly defeated,'' said Tom
Hurwitz. a freelance cinematographer who thought a majority's greed
overcame a minority's ideals.
   ``You become an anachronism _ and a very bitter one _ if you're
not careful,'' said Bettina Berch, who was among the hundreds of
former protesters who last weekend marked the 20th anniversary of a
weeklong student uprising that shut down the Ivy League campus.
   ``One of the things that makes me sad is that people who are
younger than us picked up on the drugs and forgot most of the rest
of what we were saying,'' said Ann Hunter, 40. ``Drugs were our
biggest mistake.''
   During panel discussions, a party and an indoor picnic, they
recalled how about 1,000 people, mostly students, barricaded
themselves inside five buildings the week of April 23, 1968. The
protest drew international attention to the issues of racism, the
Vietnam War and the status quo in general.
   ``This has plunged some of us into a lot of memories that one
still feels ambivalent about,'' said Berch.
   After college, Berch clung to her anti-establishment leanings.
She said she was ``kicked out of academia'' in a tenure fight after
seven years of teaching at Barnard College and is now writing a
book.
   ``In their own terms, we were an aberration, a time when they
lost control,'' she said. ``We became very difficult creatures.''
   Some people refused to discuss their feelings, saying the
reunion had brought back painful memories.
   ``I remember seeing people I knew with arms in slings and heads
in bandages,'' said Ann Hunter, now a law editor.
   Acting Columbia College Dean Henry Coleman was held hostage
during the revolt. Professor Orest Ranum lost a decade's research
when a protester torched his files.
   Later, Ted Gold, a member of the radical Weather Underground,
was killed when a homemade bomb exploded in a Greenwich Village
townhouse in 1970; David Gilbert is serving a 75-year prison
sentence for his role in a 1981 armed car robbery.
   At a panel discussion, an audience of 500 applauded more
youthful memories of the two men.
   Others chose to recall the lighter moments:
   _The wedding of Andrea and Richard Egan in occupied Fayerweather
Hall; Episcopal chaplain William Starr crawled in through the
window.
   _A pie tossed in the face of a Marine colonel recruiting on
campus.
   _Mark Naison, now a historian, taking his Ph.D. oral exam in a
building that was under occupation. He passed the exam and his
professors left through a window.
   ``There was a sense of real life, real peace, real happiness,''
said Hunter. ``There was a feeling of opening up _ people engaging
in real dialogue. People who had gone around like little moles
began to speak up.''
   ``(There was) incredible unity, a kind of physical feeling,''
agreed Hurwitz. ``It was a triumph of morality in a way that
morality has rarely triumphed since.''
   ``It's sort of sweet, like people around the campfire,'' said
Dave Crebs, 33, of Boston, about the reunion.
   The returning alums opted for bluejeans or baggy corduroys, a
few teamed with ties and sports jackets, a few with paunches. There
were plenty of smiles and embraces, and buzzwords like ``the
perversion of capitalism'' surfaced now and then.
   ``Up against the wall!'' hollered members of the audience,
invoking the once-familiar phrase to request that a podium be moved
away from the movie screen at a panel discussion.
   They applauded Abbie Hoffman, who wore a tie-died T-shirt and
sat in the front row _ a prominent bald spot and a red bandana
adorning his frizzy, gray hair.
   Hoffman had helped fuel the strikers' conviction, along with Tom
Hayden, H. Rap Brown, Stokely Carmichael, William Kunstler, Allen
Ginsberg and the Grateful Dead.
   ``It was not a prank or a party, although many have described it
as the best time of their lives,'' said Mark Rudd of Albuquerque,
N.M., who was chairman of Students for a Democratic Society in 1968.

   Tokyo share prices rose across the board today and
the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at a record high. The dollar
remained stable.
   The Nikkei Index of 225 selected issues in the Tokyo Stock
Exchange gained 155.08 points from Saturday's closing to end the
day at 27,213.45, a record closing for the market's main index.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a moderate 850
million shares.
   Market watchers said the firmer dollar and rising bullish
sentiment in the market helped the stock prices rise in a broad
activities.
   ``There is no particular issues that rose more noticeably than
others,'' said a trader at a major Japanese securities firm, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But there is general sentiment
among the investors that share prices still have more room above
them.''
   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at
125.00 yen, up 0.35 yen from Friday's close of 124.65 yen. It had
opened the day at 125.05 yen.
   Traders said investors were cautious ahead of Tuesday's pending
release of U.S. Gross National Product figures for the first
quarter of 1988.
   ``The dollar opened at a relatively high level at 125.05 (yen)
and flctuated only a bit around that level,'' said Hiroaki
Shukuzawa of Sumitomo Bank, a Japanese commercial bank. ``And the
dollar continued to show some strength throughout the day.''

   Wildlife rescuers fear hundreds of more
birds could be found coated in some of the 21,000 gallons of crude
oil that spilled along 10 miles of Suisun Bay.
   More than 100 oil-covered birds and other wildlife were taken
Sunday to Berkeley and Walnut Creek to be cleaned following
Saturday's spill just outside the northeastern reach of San
Francisco Bay, where it joins the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
rescuers said.
   ``Oil and marshes don't go together,'' said Al McNabnay, vice
president of Mount Diablo Audubon Society. ``It's doomsday for the
little birds and the big ones.''
   Cleanup crews used vacuum trucks, skimming boats and absorbent
barriers at various sites to mop up the oil, which began leaking
into Peyton Slough and then Suisun Bay from drainage pipes leading
to a storage tank at a Shell Co. refinery.
   Workers mainly tried to contain the thick, gooey slick in the
slough and the adjacent Shell Marsh, a bird habitat.
   ``We've classified this as a major oil spill,'' said Capt. David
Zawadzki, of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office.
   Officials warned that the biggest threat to wildlife would come
if any of the oil reached marshes on the northern side of the bay
or wetlands along the San Francisco Bay.
   If the oil reached the bay, it would be virtually impossible to
contain, said Capt. Ryan Broddrick of the state Fish and Game
Department.
   ``It would race up and down the bay with the tide and affect
hundreds of miles of marshland,'' he said.
   The International Berkeley Bird Center reported receiving 55
ducks covered with oil. They were expected to survive. About 40
birds received at the Alexander Lindsay Museum in Walnut Creek also
were in good condition, said Ms. Granados.
   The museum also received two muskrats, pond turtles, ducks and a
great blue heron, a protected species.
   Jay Holcomb, spokesman for the Berkeley center, said he and
others fear they will find hundreds more birds coated in oil today.
   Officials did not know how many birds have been found dead at
the scene. Two were reported to have died at the rescue centers.
   The spill occurred at the peak of the nesting season, said state
wildlife biologist Bob Wright.
   The leak was quickly plugged, said Shell spokeswoman Judith
Morad.
   KGO-TV of San Francisco quoted unidentified Coast Guard
officials as saying the cleanup of boats and the marshes would cost
at least $250,000 and take several days.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally In Three Cities To Commemorate Armenian Massacre</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Armenian-Americans rallied in three U.S. cities to
commemorate the 73rd anniversary of a massacre in which Armenians
claim more than 1.5 million of their countrymen were killed by the
Ottoman Empire.
   In Los Angeles, at least 13 protesters were arrested Sunday
after they smashed windows and burned a symbolic Turkish flag
during a protest at the Turkish Consulate, police said.
   Most of the demonstrators had been part of a crowd of 10,000 who
gathered earlier Sunday at Los Angeles City College.
   ``We can't change the tragedy that occurred 73 years ago under
the Ottoman Empire, but we can and we must change the way the world
thinks about that genocide,'' California Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy told
the crowd.
   Vasken Khodanian, spokesman for the Armenian Human Rights
Council, said Armenians want the Turkish government to recognize
the killings and compensate the survivors.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., told the crowd he has asked
President Reagan to discuss the plight of Armenians during the
summit with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Armenia is a republic
of the Soviet Union.
   ``Let us hear no more of glasnost if ... Gorbachev will not
guarantee Armenian rights. Let us not think that 1915 cannot happen
again,'' he said.
   The Los Angeles Armenian community of 200,000, the largest
outside the Soviet Union, annually commemorates the massacre.
   In New York, more than 2,000 people gathered in Times Square.
   ``We are here to try to get Congress to pass a resolution to
declare April 24 as a Day of Remembrance and to get the U.S. State
Department to drop the word `alleged' when referring to the
Armenian genocide,'' said Sam Azadian, a rally organizer.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch told the crowd: ``The truth is that there
was an attempt by the Ottoman Turks to destroy the Armenians and
thank God they were not successful _ but the truth is they tried.
If we do not remember what happened to the Armenians we will not
remember what happened to the Jews.''
   Many survivors of the massacre were among the Times Square
crowd, including 80-year-old M. Manuelian.
   ``When I was a little boy I remember the Turks coming and taking
everything from us,'' Manuelian said. ``They took my father away
and I never saw him again.''
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., told nearly 1,000 demonstrators in
Watertown, Mass., that people everywhere had a moral responsibility
to call attention to the tragedy.
   ``Oppression and injustice to one people is a moral loss
affecting all mankind,'' Kennedy said.
   Leaders of the march in the Boston suburb said the protesters
also were expressing their solidarity with the people of the Soviet
region of Nargorno-Karabakh, which Armenians want attached to their
republic.
   Foreign powers have ruled Armenia for most of its history. On
April 24, 1915, more than 200 Armenian intellectuals and political
leaders were slain or deported by the crumbling Turkish Ottoman
Empire, signaling the start of more than eight years of killings.
   Turkish officials have said that 300,000 Armenians perished in
the turmoil of deportations and local reprisals. Some historians
estimated 600,000 died.

   Police were ordered to return
gunfire with gunfire as they sought to end four days of violent
clashes with Melanesian separatists in which 27 policemen were
kidnapped and four killed.
   The violence disrupted elections in this French Pacific island
territory in which residents voted for regional candidates and for
a slate of nine candidates running in the first round of France's
presidential contest.
   French Minister for Overseas Territories Bernard Pons arrived in
this archipelago late Sunday and instructed gendarmes to ``respond
to arms with arms.'' Leopold Joredie, a leader of the Kanak
Socialist National Liberation Front, today said the separatists
would continue their ``mobilization.'' Pons' instructions were ``a
declaration of colonial war,'' he added.
   The verbal confrontation followed four days of violence between
police and pro-independence Melanesians that began with the
storming of a police station Friday on the island of Ouvea, 90
miles northeast of the capital of Noumea.
   Twenty-seven gendarmes were taken hostage in the attack and
three of their colleagues were hacked to death with machetes. A
fourth gendarme injured in the attack died on Sunday in a Sydney,
Australia. Three Melanesians were injured.
   The kidnappers demanded the regional elections be canceled and
that police reinforcements be removed from the island. They also
demanded that negotiators be sent from Paris to discuss
independence for the island.
   ``We do not negotiate with terrorists and criminals,'' Pons
said. ``These terrorists will be treated as terrorists.''
   At dawn today, 11 of the hostages were freed, French Defense
Minster Andre Giraud announced in Paris. About 300 police continued
combing a forest in northern Ouvea for the remaining 16 hostages.
   A Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front statement issued in
Paris said the traditional tribal chiefs requested the release ``to
avert reprisals against their tribe and the population'' by the
French army.
   ``France's policy in New Caledonia today is worthy of a banana
republic,'' the statement said.
   Later today, a teen-age Melanesian was fatally shot in a clash
between police and militant separatists, the privately-owned radio
station TUW reported. It said the youth died after French gendarmes
and Kanaks opened fire as the police were leaving their post in the
eastern town of Canala.
   On Sunday, an officer was shot in the stomach while guarding a
polling station in Canala, on the island's east coast.
   Barricades were set up by the separatists to disrupt polling,
ballots were burned, telephone lines were cut and police used tear
gas to disperse crowds of protesters on several islands.
   Thirty-eight of 139 polling stations were closed because of
gunfire and explosions which punctuated the elections as voters
cast double ballots in presidential and regional elections.
   Officials said turnout in the voting, boycotted by militants
seeking independence, was 56.3 percent. Conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac, who finished second behind incumbent President
Francois Mitterrand with 19.9 percent of the vote in France, scored
an overwhelming victory among those casting ballots in New
Caledonia, taking nearly 74.6 percent of the vote.
   Chirac will face Mitterrand in a runoff election on May 8.
   In voting for 48 legislative seats, the pro-French Rally for the
Republic in Caledonia, the territorial branch of Chirac's
neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic Party, won 35 and the
extreme-right National Front won eight.
   Two small, right-wing parties won three seats, while dissident
separatists won two. Those holding the 48 seats also will assist in
four regional councils.
   Joredie said actions to disrupt Sunday's elections were a
``first step.''
   ``The second step is the second round. We must establish a force
sufficient to open discussions with the new government'' toward
independence, he said.
   ``There are people here who are ready to fight to the end,'' he
said by telephone.
   The new territorial assembly was created by Chirac's government
over the objections of militant native Melanesians, known as
Kanaks, who make up 43 percent of the island group's population of
145,000. Thirty-six percent of the residents are Europeans, while
the rest are mainly Asian or Tahitian.
   Many of the Melanesians are demanding independence for New
Caledonia.
   Police in Noumea said six gendarmes were injured Sunday in
Canala by ``thrown explosives.'' They were taken to a hospital in
Noumea, where one was listed in serious condition.

<HEAD>Panama Pulls Plug On Electricity To U.S. Embassy Annex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's state-run electric utility
shut off power to a U.S. Embassy annex and the apartments of at
least 45 of the embassy's 180 workers for not paying their bills.
   Also Sunday, the civilian chief executive who replaced ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle named seven new Cabinet members to
``confront the grave situation facing the nation.''
   Workers from the Hydraulic and Electrical Resources Institute
disconnected electrical meters at apartments of the embassy
staffers, whose power bills haven't been paid in more than two
months. The state utility regularly cuts off power to consumers who
do not pay their bills for two months.
   ``The only difference here is that they did it on a Sunday and
they targeted it all very deliberately,'' said Terence Kneebone, a
spokesman for the embassy. ``Any other business, they normally
would have done it on a workday.''
   ``They obviously said, `OK, we're going to take the gringos
out,''' Kneebone said. He said the embassy itself and the residence
of Ambassador Arthur Davis were left with power, although the
electric bills for those facilities also had not been paid.
   Two weeks ago, the Reagan administration ordered a ban on all
payments to the government by U.S. citizens and organizations.
   However, Kneebone said the embassy, which pays the rent and
utility bills of its American employees, stopped making payments
even earlier at the request of Delvalle, whom the United States
still recognizes as Panama's president.
   Delvalle was deposed Feb. 26, one day after he tried to fire
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the nation's de facto leader, as chief
of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces. Noriega is under
indictment in U.S. federal courts on charges of drug trafficking.
The United States also imposed economic sanctions on Panama which
led to a severe economic crisis in Panama.
   Manuel Solis Palma, who announced the new Cabinet appointments
Sunday, became the new chief executive after Delvalle's ouster.
   Solis Palma said he would name new heads of some semi-autonomous
agencies and departments today.
   All ministers and department chiefs offered their resignations
to him last week. The new ministers replace officials that Solis
Palma inherited when he replaced Delvalle.
   Solis Palma said the primary goal of his new administrative team
would be to reopen the nation's banks, closed since March 4 because
of a lack of money to cover withdrawals by panicky depositors.
   He named Orville Goodin as treasury minister, Barisnel Espino as
agriculture minister, Rolando Murgas as education minister, Jorge
Ritter as foreign minister, Rene Bultron as public works director,
Gustavo Gonzalez as head of planning and economic policy, and Cesar
Martans, chief of Labor and Social Welfare.
   Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian Democratic
Party and a leading opposition figure, said the changes appeared to
be aimed at giving the administration legitimacy, ``but I think it
represents absolutely nothing really new for the public.'' He
added: ``It remains an illegal government, run by General Noriega
and nothing more than that.''

<TEXT>
   In cash-starved Panama, Horacio Icaza
has added one of mankind's oldest forms of trade to his business
skills. He barters.
   Icaza, whose firm Casa del Medico is the nation's largest
medical equipment supplier, recently worked out a deal with the
government-owned water and power companies.
   He pooled some of his employees' water and electric bills, then
told the utilities he would erase a similar amount from the debts
they owed his firm for laboratory equipment.
   They agreed, and debts on both side of the ledger were wiped out
_ without any money changing hands.
   Panama, suffering from sweeping U.S. economic sanctions and the
nearly two-month closure of its once-formidable banking center, has
now become a barter economy.
   ``It stops people from starving to death, but it doesn't get the
economy moving,'' said a Western European diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   ``Panamanians have surpassed by much the traditional banking
ability and capability of Swiss bankers,'' said former banker Luis
H. Moreno. ``We have been able to do banking outside of banks.''
   Panama's economic crisis was caused by the controversy
surrounding Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the nation's military
leader and the power behind the civilian government. Noriega is
under federal indictment in the United States on drug trafficking
and money laundering charges.
   In a bid to oust Noriega, Washington has cut off military and
economic aid to Panama, frozen its assets in the United States and
prohibited U.S. companies and individuals from making payments to
the government.
   The sanctions, combined with the closure of the banking system
and a two-week general strike in March, have virtually paralyzed
the economy.
   The U.S. dollar, the national currency, has become scarce.
   Its place has been partially filled by checks issued in small
amounts by the government to pay its employees and Social Security
recipients.
   With those checks, Panamanians can buy groceries at supermarkets
or clothing at department stores. They also can send the checks
back to the government to pay taxes or utility fees they owe the
state-run water, electric and telephone companies.
   The checks, say businessmen, have become a quasi-currency.
   Late Saturday afternoon, the Rodriguez family kept a close tab
on the price-tags of the meat, chicken, cheese, bread, juice, fish,
milk and eggs piled into a shopping basket at the Rey supermarket
on Via Espana.
   They planned to fill the basket with food totaling $100 _ the
amount of a Social Security check the elder Rodriguez had received
from the government. The Rey chain accepts government checks but
gives no change on any unused portion.
   On down the street, Blanca Robles, an English and art teacher,
used a $50 paycheck from the government to buy clothing at a
department store, which had sharply reduced the prices on much of
its merchandise.
   With the checks, businesses can turn around and pay taxes,
duties or other fees owed the government _ all without dipping into
scarce cash.
   Some of the savvy dealers approach people waiting to pay their
utility bills, offering to swap a government check for their cash.
   Still others offer to give government employees and retired
people cash for their checks, but at a discounted rate. A $100
check, for example, can bring $80 or so.
   Some corporate checks also have become a form of currency.
   Supermarkets have made arrangements to accept checks issued by
their suppliers. The suppliers pay their employees in
small-denomination checks, which can be used to buy food or other
necessities.
   In a complicated arrangement, the supermarkets then return the
checks to the suppliers in payment against their accounts,
businessmen said.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Calm Trading, Gold Slightly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was steady in calm European trading
today. Gold prices rose slightly.
   The dollar is likely to trade quietly in the coming days and may
move a bit higher until midweek, several dealers said. But a
Frankfurt dealer said he expects a downturn for the dollar close to
the end of the week since there are no substantial factors
supporting the currency.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 125.00 yen. Later, in London, it
fell back to 124.55 yen.
   Financial markets in Italy were closed for a national holiday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
rates:
   _1.6745 West German marks, up from 1.6730
   _1.3835 Swiss francs, down from 1.3840
   _5.6865 French francs, unchanged
   _1.87775 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8770
   _1.2320 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2324
   _1,244.50 lire, unchanged
   In London, it cost $1.8815 to buy one pound, cheaper than
$1.8880 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $448.85 a troy ounce,
down from late Friday's $449. But at midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of
$449.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $449.25, up from $449 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to $451.13 from Saturday's
$451.58.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.41 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $6.46.

   After nine days and 55 witnesses,
prosecutors are almost done describing how a quiet clan of
polygamists defied the state for nearly two weeks during which one
of the 100 surrounding lawmen was killed.
   Talk of divine revelation and the Lord's will have colored the
trial, just as it did during the siege at the farm occupied by 15
people, including defendants Vickie Singer, clan leader Addam
Swapp, Swapp's brother Jonathan and Mrs. Singer's son John Timothy
Singer.
   Defense attorney John Bucher describes the case as ``just a
tragedy _ a heartbreak'' that few outside Utah could understand.
   For the authorities, it is a tale of fanaticism gone haywire.
   After an explosion ripped through a Mormon Church building in
Marion on Jan. 16, the clan's six adults and nine children
barricaded themselves on their 2{-acre farm, warning police to stay
away.
   For 13 days, the state's top police officials and FBI experts
from around the country surrounded the farm and hunkered down
nearby, reluctant to storm the compound.
   Nevertheless, on Jan. 28 the siege ended in a shootout. State
Corrections Lt. Fred House, a dog handler, was killed while
ordering two balking police dogs to attack ringleader Addam Swapp,
who was shot and wounded by two agents.
   Within days, a federal grand jury indicted the defendants on
charges of firearms possession, use and possession of a bomb,
assault and attempted murder of federal agents.
   The U.S. district court trial has been followed attentively by
an odd mix of spectators, including a Los Angeles film producer,
Addam Swapp's two wives and a teen-ager who plans to marry Jonathan
Swapp next month.
   ``You will hear evidence that this was more than just a bombing
_ that it was an invitation to a violent confrontation,'' U.S.
Attorney Brent Ward promised jurors in his opening statement.
   Ward has produced much evidence that the wheelchair-bound John
Timothy Singer was House's killer and Addam Swapp the bomber.
Prosecution witnesses have included Mormon bishops and journalists.
   Vickie Singer told an FBI negotiator in a taped conversation
that the bombing was ordered by God as a sign of the impending
collapse of church, state and nation.
   ``Yes, I am saying yes, the Lord did want that chapel bombed,''
said the 44-year-old clan matriarch who has appeared in court
smiling and waving and wearing bows in her hip-length blond hair.
   The clan espouses practices taught by early Mormon leaders,
including multiple marriages, which was abandoned by the Mormon
church in 1890.
   Federal agents have testified about gunfire they dodged during
the standoff, which came to a head when Mrs. Singer and Addam Swapp
responded to written entreaties from Gov. Norm Bangerter with dire
prophecy and belligerence.
   Swapp's letter denounced the government and the Mormon church
and declared the Singer farm a nation ``independent and separate
from your wicked society of ever-changing laws and dark councils
that seek to enslave the minds and souls of man.''
   The clan had buttressed its resolve with the belief that John
Singer, husband of Mrs. Singer and father-in-law of Swapp, would be
resurrected when society collapsed.
   Singer was fatally shot in 1979 outside the farm after he
brandished a gun at authorities trying to arrest him on warrants
stemming from his refusal to send his children to public schools.
   Bucher, Swapp's co-counsel, says the family's beliefs must be
considered.
   ``The trial should be about the reasons and motivation of these
people,'' he said. ``This case is simply not what it's made out to
be. This is not a gang that got together to bomb a church.''
   Still, Bucher isn't sure he'll give in to his client's desire to
testify. He and the five other defense attorneys weren't happy when
Adam Swapp showed up for the trial wearing a beaded buckskin jacket
emblazoned with the flag of early Mormon pioneers.
   The nine feathers hanging from the jacket, reminiscent of the
nine feathers on a spear left at the bombed chapel, symbolize the
nine years since John Singer's death.
   John Timothy Singer, in a statement to agents after his arrest,
said it was no coincidence the church was bombed two days before
the anniversary of his father's death. He said it happened ``so
that dad's death would be recognized. We could see there was no
justice.''

   Only one man has been executed in Israel's 40-year history.
Adolf Eichmann, architect of the Holocaust, was hanged in 1962.
   Demjanjuk attended today's session in a wheelchair, complaining
of a bad back. A Christian, he was seen making the sign of the
cross and whispering to himself, apparently praying, during
arguments from prosecutors who demanded the death penalty.
   Demjanjuk's lawyers have said they will appeal his conviction to
the Supreme Court.
   Several hundred onlookers crowded into the converted movie
theater to hear the verdict. Earlier, longtime observers said they
expected the judges to sentence Demjanjuk to death because of their
sweeping guilty verdict which discounted each defense argument.
   ``I believe a proven Nazi war criminal definitely deserves to be
put to death,'' Demjanjuk's son, 22-year-old John Jr., told The
Associated Press before the sentence was announced.
   ``But they are not asking for a death penalty here. They are
asking for my father to be murdered _ because he is innocent,'' the
younger Demjanjuk said, chain-smoking and pacing nervously.
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was found to be the guard ``Ivan''
who ran the gas chambers at the Treblinka death camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland. Some 800,000 Jews died in 1942 and 1943, when
``Ivan'' worked at the camp.
   Demjanjuk has consistently alleged he is a victim of mistaken
identity, although he admitted lying on his American emigration
papers about his past. He contends he was held in a Nazi prisoner
of war camp during the critical period in question.
   ``I am not Ivan the Terrible, and to that God is the most just
witness. He knows I am innocent,'' Demjanjuk told the court today.
He spoke in Ukrainian.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
today said NATO faces a problem if Denmark attempts to forbid U.S.
warships with nuclear arms from docking at its ports.
   ``It's up to all of us to measure up to our responsibilities,''
Shultz said after briefing the North Atlantic Council on his talks
last week in Moscow.
   He acknowledged prospects were dim that the United States and
the Soviet Union would conclude a treaty to halve their strategic
nuclear arsenals in time for the May 29-June 2 summit meeting in
Moscow.
   ``It's extremely difficult to get there,'' Shultz said at a news
conference before flying home.
   Shultz said if a strategic arms reduction treaty (START) is not
signed at the Moscow summit, the Reagan administration would keep
pushing in its twilight months for an accord. ``We'll keep at it,
we're not going to stop,'' he said.
   But he disputed suggestions that superpower relations had
slumped since December's signing of a treaty last year to ban
intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
   Citing the Soviet decision to withdraw an estimated 115,000
troops from Afghanistan, Shultz said of East-West relations, ``I
think the picture is one in which we see general progress.''
   After the session with the NATO allies, Shultz met privately
with Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, to register
his concerns over a Danish Parliament resolution that could bar
U.S. warships with nuclear arms from Danish ports.
   On April 14, Danish socialists pushed a measure in Parliament
that required the government to tell visiting ships that nuclear
arms are barred from Danish ports in peacetime.
   For 30 years, Denmark has barred such ships from its ports, but
the government avoided the provision by not asking ships if they
were carrying nuclear arms.
   After the vote, Denmark's center-right government, which opposed
the measure, called for early elections on May 10.
   Ellemann-Jensen said, ``We want to get a clear message from our
voters they want Denmark to remain a full member of the alliance.''
   Denmark is one of the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and among the leaders in pushing for nuclear
disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union.
   Ellemann-Jensen said he wants to end Denmark's maverick position
within the alliance. ``If we get the signal from the voters we are
asking for, it will be possible to reach a fair solution.''
   Such a solution would mean Denmark sticks by its current ban on
nuclear arms on its soil and simply expects visiting warships to
respect that, he said.
   U.S. and British warships, as a matter of policy, never divulge
if their warships carry nuclear arms. The Danish resolution has led
Britain to suspend visits to Denmark by Royal Navy vessels.

   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac today received
the backing of the centrist Union for French Democracy in his
uphill battle to defeat Socialist President Francois Mitterrand in
the presidential runoff May 8.
   Chirac, a 55-year-old neo-Gaullist, finished a distant second in
first-round voting Sunday to Mitterrand, who is seeking a second
seven-year term.
   Chirac picked up the support of the centrist party's leader,
64-year-old Raymond Barre, Sunday night shortly after polls closed.
Barre, a former premier, finished third in the voting.
   The Union for French Democracy formally endorsed Chirac today,
but it was not known how many of its supporters would vote for
Chirac. Exit polls showed many members of the centrist party might
support Mitterrand in the runoff.
   ``I support him in his fight,'' said Barre of Chirac. ``And I
ask all those who voted for me to vote for him in the second
round.''
   However, Barre did not write Chirac a blank check. ``I count on
him to defend the objectives to which we are particularly attached,
an open and tolerant society that rejects xenophobia, racism and
extremism,'' Barre said.
   His comments were aimed at the candidate of the extreme right,
Jean-Marie Le Pen, who finished just behind Barre and whose
endorsement could be key to a Chirac victory.
   Le Pen, president of the National Front, won 14.5 percent of the
vote _ well above predictions. His campaign speeches included calls
for deporting immigrants and quarantining victims of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   A cartoon in the leftist daily Liberation today showed Le Pen,
dressed as a stormtrooper, standing inside Chirac's open mouth and
saying, ``From now on, nothing in this country gets done without
me.''
   In an editorial, Liberation editor Serge July wrote: ``Two years
under Mitterrand have multiplied discontent with Chirac. Le Pen has
systematically welcomed this, once again making France an
`exceptional' democracy, the only one in the Western world where
the economic and political crisis has engendered an extremist
electorate.''
   Le Pen, 59, said he will tell his supporters at a rally on
Sunday how to vote on May 8.
   An editorial in the conservative daily Le Figaro today said the
task of attracting Le Pen followers without alienating Barre's
constituents was difficult but not impossible.
   ``The right has no reason to call this a lost cause as long as
Chirac can rally around him all the men and women in this country
who don't want Mitterrand's re-election,'' Le Figaro said.
   With 98 percent of the vote counted on Sunday, the 71-year-old
Mitterrand had 33.9 percent, ahead of Chirac, who with 19.9 percent
did not do as well as expected. Barre was third with 16.6 percent.
   A telephone poll conducted by state-run Antenne 2 television
after the results were announced showed that Mitterrand would
defeat Chirac in the runoff, winning 55 percent of the vote.
   In a brief statement, Mitterrand said on Sunday: ``Now the
choice is simple. To all of you who serve France, we have great
tasks before us. Let us rally together, neglecting no effort to win
May 8.''
   The Communist Party, once a significant political force, slumped
to its lowest score in party history, with Andre Lajoinie getting
6.8 percent.
   Rounding out the nine-candidate field were Antoine Waechter, an
ecologist with 3.8 percent; Pierre Juquin, leader of a splinter
Communist reformist group, 2.1 percent; Arlette Laguiller, head of
the Trotskyist Worker Strggle Movement 2 percent; and Pierre
Boussel leader of another Trotskyist group 0.4 percent. Turnout by
France's 38 milion voters was more than 82 percent.
   The choice facing French voters May 8 is more over what kind of
president they want rather than the positions of the two candidates.
   This is Mitterrand's fourth presidential race. He was defeated
by Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1965 and by Valery Giscard d'Estaing
in 1974 before winning in 1981.
   Chirac, a smiling, energetic campaigner, heads the neo-Gaullist
Rally for the Republic Party.
   He has run the government since the right won the legislative
elections in 1986 in what the French call ``cohabitation'' with a
leftist president.
   The president is the chief of state. The premier, elected by the
legislature, is the head of government. Sunday's vote marked the
first time a president and premier have opposed one another in a
presidential election.
   Discussion in the next few days is likely to focus on a date and
format for a televised Mitterrand-Chirac debate. Mitterrand has
suggested Thursday. Chirac wants a date in the final week of the
campaign.
   A debate is vastly more important to Chirac, who hopes it will
help him make up ground against the president.
   On the issues, both candidates support an open economy and want
to improve France's education system, spending more on technical
training and research.
   On foreign and defense policies, both speak of the need for
France to become more involved in Europe's defenses.

<HEAD>12,000 Union Members Vote on Caterpillar No-Strike Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratification of a limited no-strike clause
will mean more jobs for Caterpillar Inc.'s parts subsidiary, union
and company officials say.
   Voting over several days by some 12,000 members of United Auto
Workers Caterpillar locals nationwide was capped Sunday with
ballots in Peoria and Decatur, where union officials reported large
majorities favoring the no-strike agreement.
   A final official vote tally still must be transmitted from the
union to the company, Gil Nolde, a company spokesman, said late
Sunday.
   The agreement extends indefinitely the contract with Caterpillar
Logistic Services, a parts-distribution subsidiary that covers
about 1,000 employees. Most of the workers are based in Morton,
Ill., with some in Delavan, Ill., and Memphis, Tenn.
   Caterpillar officials, based in Peoria, said they needed the
no-strike clause to attract major contracts for CLS. The subsidiary
was formed in January 1987 to provide warehousing and distribution
services for parts and equipment for companies around the world.
   CLS President James Baldwin said recently the company is ready
to bid on or sign three such contracts in 1988, including one with
the Defense Department. He said the contracts could translate into
thousands of new jobs.
   Union officials had feared that without approval of the limited
no-strike clause, the company might move the jobs to non-union
facilities.
   Under the agreement, CLS parts-distribution workers will remain
on the job even if the UAW and Caterpillar don't reach a master
contract agreement by Sept. 30, and even if manufacturing workers
decide to strike.
   The parts-distribution workers would not be allowed to strike
until after a new central bargaining agreement is reached. They
then would have 60 days to negotiate a new local contract and could
strike at the end of that period.
   ``We are pleased with the vote,'' Jerry Flaherty, Caterpillar
vice president of employee and labor relations, said in a statement
late Sunday. ``We can now talk to potential customers about
continuing, reliable CAT Logistics service from facilities with UAW
employees. It means more jobs, and that's good news.''
   In Peoria, the agreement won 62 percent of the votes cast from
United Auto Workers Local 974, with 837 in favor of it and 519
against, said Tony Green, the local's president. The vote covered
plants in East Peoria, Mapleton and Mossville.
   In Decatur, Local 751 members who participated gave the
agreement an 82 percent vote of approval, said Local President
Larry Solomon. He refused to say how many of his 2,000 members
voted, or to give the actual vote totals.
   ``I think the general sentiment is that if it could mean jobs,
we've got to try it,'' Solomon said.
   Union members in Memphis, Tenn., Denver, Colo., Dallas, Texas,
York, Pa., Davenport, Iowa, and Aurora, Ill., already had ratified
the agreement.

<HEAD>Strike Against Car Bombing As Death Toll Reaches 70</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tripoli was brought to a standstill
today as citizens went on strike to protest the nation's worst car
bombing in three years. The death toll in the blast rose to 70.
   Police said 100 people remained hospitalized following
Saturday's blast in a crowded vegetable market in this northern
port city.
   A man wounded in the explosion in the low-income Tabbaneh
district died early today, increasing the total number of dead to
70.
   Schools, shops, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, banks and other
businesses were closed today throughout Lebanon's second largest
city, whose 850,000 people are predominantly Sunni Moslem.
   The strike, on the second day of a 48-hour period of public
mourning, was called by city leaders.
   The explosion claimed the most lives of any car bombing in
Lebanon since March 8, 1985, when 80 people were killed and 250
wounded in an explosion in the Shiite Moslem district of Bir
el-Abed in south Beirut.
   No group has claimed resonsibility for Saturday's blast in
Tripoli, 50 miles north of Beirut.
   Earlier car bombings have been blamed on sectarian strife
stemming from Lebanon's 13-year-old civil war between Moslems and
Christians as well as feuds involving Palestinians, Syrians and
Israelis.

<HEAD>Peel Acquitted in Eight Fishing Boat Killings in 1982</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for a former crewman who was
acquitted in the killings of eight people aboard a fishing boat
said the man's family may file suit because of the four-year ordeal
that became the most expensive criminal case in Alaska history.
   John Kenneth Peel was acquitted Saturday of eight counts of
first-degree murder and one count of first-degree arson in the 1982
deaths aboard the Investor. He had been tried twice; the first
trial resulted in a hung jury.
   ``It's terrible being an innocent man accused of a crime,'' Peel
said . ``I just thank God it's over. Justice did work this time.''
   Peel, a boatbuilder from Bellingham, Wash., who once crewed on
the Investor, was accused of killing skipper Mark Coulthurst, his
wife Irene, two Coulthurst children and four teen-age crew members.
The Coulthursts were from Blaine, Wash., and three crew members
were from the Blaine-Bellingham area.
   The Investor was found burning near the southeastern Alaska town
of Craig in September 1982, and Peel was not arrested until two
years after the crime.
   ``From the moment it was issued, I have always said the
indictment was not worth the paper it was written on,'' said
defense attorney Phillip Weidner.
   ``The prosecutors put an innocent man and his family through
this ordeal for four years,'' Weidner said, adding that the family
is considering a lawsuit to seek restitution. But he declined to
say who might be the target of such a suit.
   On Saturday, Peel, 27, broke into tears and his family cheered
when the jury announced its decision in Juneau Superior Court. His
family had been with him throughout the three-month trial, with
financial support from friends and family in Bellingham.
   On the advice of his attorney, Peel did not answer any
questions. He and his wife, Cathy, declined comment on what they
might do next.
   ``We're going to have no place to go but up from here,'' Mrs.
Peel said.
   Prosecutor Mary Anne Henry, who handled both trials, told jurors
the state had bungled the Investor investigation, had no evidence
of a motive and no physical evidence against Peel.
   Nonetheless, she contended the prosecution could prove its case
based on witnesses who said they saw Peel near the Investor around
the time of the killings and in the fishing vessel's skiff after
the larger boat was found burning in a cove near Craig.
   Peel was working on another fishing boat docked in Craig at the
time.
   Peel's brother-in-law, Jack Perram, said Peel can return to a
job at Perram's Bellingham boatyard.
   ``I'm sort of like a zombie,'' said Peel's mother, Marilyn Peel.
``It's been a long three days since the jury went out.''
   Relatives of the victims said they were disappointed.
   ``Somebody ought to pay,'' said Ted Smith, who was related to
five of those slain. ``I don't say it should have been Peel, but it
should have been somebody.''
   ``I thought after being up there for a couple of weeks (watching
the trial) that they would find him guilty, as they should have,''
said Ruth Moon, mother of slain crew member Dean Moon, who was at
her home in Bellingham.
   The state spent $2 million on the investigation and on Peel's
first trial, and budgeted $700,000 for the retrial. The defense
rested its case the second time without calling any witnesses.
   ``I didn't put a case on because there was no need to dignify
this case by putting on witnesses,'' said Weidner.
   Jury deliberations began Wednesday evening. The jury forewoman
said members of the panel had agreed not to talk to reporters.
   Peel had been in his parents' custody on a $1 million property
bond since his arrest in September 1984.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador Tells Japan to Drop Barriers and Share Burden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansfield today called on
Japan to join in dropping trade barriers and contribute more to its
own defense.
   Mansfield's remarks came two days after Japanese farmers smashed
and burned an American car, torched boxes of U.S. oranges and set
fire to a U.S. flag in a rally in western Japan. The estimated 300
farmers were protesting U.S. demands that Japan end its
restrictions on imported beef and oranges.
   For two hours today, Mansfield answered questions at the
invitation of a foreign affairs and defense committee of the
Japanese legislature.
   The former U.S. senator, a specialist in international affairs,
was asked by committee chairman Takenori Kato of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party about the agricultural issues that have
embroiled the two countries in disputes since the quota system on
beef and oranges officially expired April 1.
   Mansfield said the United States does not want to destroy the
agricultural economy of any country. He urged both nations to work
toward developing a world market for food to take care of starving
people.
   Also during today's questioning, Mansfield promoted his proposal
to include Japan in a Free Trade Agreement, which is intended to
remove trade barriers between the United States and Japan and put
them on an equal footing.
   But he acknowledged that neither country had shown any interest
in the plan. Mansfield said the ``prospect looks very bleak
indeed'' for such an accord, even though the United States is
working on similar proposals with Israel and Mexico.
   However, he said handling trade problems on an issue-by-issue
basis only increases ``the dangers of retaliation, misunderstanding
and the like.''
   Mansfield said an intermediate-range nuclear weapons agreement
under review by the U.S. Senate would put more pressure on nations
to strengthen their conventional forces at a time when the world is
already too heavily armed and too much money is being spent on
weapons.
   Although he said he wants Japan to help share the military
burden, he said he does not want Japan to violate its constitution,
which prohibits military action other than defense.
   He said the United States is no longer in a position to carry
the burden of defending other nations as it did after World War II.
   But he also said U.S. economic woes ``have been problems of our
own doing,'' and he called on Japan to help.
   Mansfield said he would like to see a purely economic union
created in the Pacific Basin.

<HEAD>Gas Price Average Jumps More Than 2 Cents in Two Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average price of gasoline nationwide
jumped 2.67 cents to nearly a dollar a gallon in the past two weeks
in what is seen as a precursor to even higher prices during the
summertime peak driving season.
   ``We have a dramatic leap in the retail price of gasoline across
the nation,'' Trilby Lundberg said Sunday after compiling results
of the Lundberg Survey of prices at 12,000 gas stations in every
state. The latest two-week survey ended April 22.
   The average price of 98.84 cents includes all grades and sales
categories as well as taxes.
   ``The greatest increases were found in the Midwest; the smallest
in the Rocky Mountains region,'' Ms. Lundberg said.
   Prices per gallon at self-service pumps were: regular unleaded,
89.90 cents; premium unleaded, 104.45 cents; regular leaded, 86.86
cents.
   At full-serve pumps, prices were: regular unleaded, 118.74
cents; premium unleaded 128.81 cents; regular leaded, 114.14 cents.
   ``There's a mixed bag of indicators for future trends because,
although wholesale prices to all types of retailers are still on
the rise, our spot price surveys show great variation with drops
and hikes in the main trading centers,'' Ms. Lundberg said.
   Crude oil prices, meanwhile, are holding and ``a good
guesstimate might be that if they continue to hold, gasoline prices
to motorists could continue to rise moderately in coming months in
response to summer demand,'' she said.
   Ms. Lundberg noted that most price change usually occurs at
self-service pumps but the latest survey showed activity at
full-serve pumps.
   ``This is a real push upward because the wholesale buying price
increases that the retailers paid in the past couple of weeks were
burdens they had to pass on, and they did,'' she said.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bus and tram drivers in the western city
of Bydgoszcz went on strike today, forcing thousands of people to
walk to work and testing Poland's determination to limit wage
increases in the face of steep price rises.
   Workers seeking higher pay listed 10 demands in their
unauthorized job action.
   Negotiations were taking place with a deputy mayor and a deputy
provicial governor at a streetcar depot in the city, said a
spokeswoman at the official transport workers union office.
   The drivers want wages to match those earned in other cities, as
well as some management changes, she said.
   Officials said it appeared there would be no early end to the
walkout. Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa said he was planning to
travel from his home in Gdansk to Bydgoszcz to offer support.
   Prices in Poland have gone up 42 percent since the beginning of
the year, the result of planned increases mandated by a government
economic reform program.
   The increases prompted nationwide pressure for pay raises among
workers. Government figures said wages rose on average 45 percent
by April 1.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, alarmed by the trend,
last month warned enterprise managers they could be fired if they
were too generous with their payrolls, thereby fueling inflation.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the unauthorized walkout
at the Provincial Transportation Enterprise in Bydgoszcz began
today at 6 a.m.
   ``The first shift refused to work,'' Urban said in a telephone
interview. ``I can't say it is the biggest strike (in recent
years). I can't even call it a strike. They didn't declare a strike
and it has no organized form.''
   Second-shift workers also refused to begin work at 2 p.m., said
a spokeswoman at Bydgoszcz transit headquarters.
   A parked bus blocked the gates of the main depot but there were
few other outward signs of discord, said a Solidarity activist in
the city, Ryszard Helak.
   Urban said the demands included a $15 a month salary raise, plus
a eight cent increase in the 38-cent-an-hour wage.
   The union spokeswoman, who would not give her name, said the
transit system employs about 2,800 workers. Urban said 229 buses
and 60 trams were idled in the city of 375,000 people, located 150
miles northwest of Warsaw.
   ``It looks like it will take a long time to resolve it,'' said
Halina Jarminowska, a spokeswoman for the Bydgoszcz Voivoidship,
the provincial government.
   ``People had to walk to work this morning,'' she said.
``Factories which have buses drove people from the night shift home
and then took those coming for the morning shift. Those working in
offices, youths going to school, had to walk.''
   Helak said Solidarity did not organize the strike.
   Walesa on Sunday said large-scale strikes might be needed to
spur reform in Poland.
   The spokeswoman at the official union office in Bydgoszcz, one
of the unions put together by the government after Solidarity was
banned in the 1981 martial law crackdown, said the strike took her
organization ``by surprise.''
   ``It was an initiative of the drivers,'' she said.

<HEAD>Hammer Signs New Joint Venture Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer, whose huge
joint venture coal mine in China has been plagued by disputes,
signed a contract today to build a new joint venture coal
preparation plant.
   He also signed an agreement for his Occidental Petroleum Corp.
of Los Angeles to sell two Chinese companies technology to produce
phosphoric acid.
   Hammer, 89, refused to disclose the dollar value of the new
projects and insisted Occidental is not losing money on the $800
million Antaibo coal mine in north China, the largest and most
high-profile U.S.-Chinese joint venture.
   Occidental has a 25 percent share in the mine, 230 miles
southwest of Beijing in Shanxi province.
   It opened with great fanfare in September but has been operating
well below capacity because of mechanical problems and disputes
with the Chinese partners over the price at which the coal should
be sold.
   ``We consider the problems we have had there minor problems,''
Hammer told a news conference after signing the two new contracts
at Beijing's luxious Diaoyutai state guesthouse.
   ``Those are the start-up problems you have with every project,''
he said. ``These will be settled and we will be at full production
we estimate by the end of the year.''
   Asked about the financial cost of the disputes and delays,
Hammer said, ``We don't figure we've lost anything.''
   He insisted the mine can be profitable once it begins producing
at its capacity of 15 million tons of raw coal per year, even if
coal prices don't recover from their current low of about $20 per
ton.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency recently reported design
problems with the mine's washing plant, which it said left too much
moisture in the coal. It blamed the mine's low production level on
the washing plant problem.
   There also have been reports of personal feuding between the
Occidental and Chinese technical staff at the mine.
   Hammer said his current visit to China was not a
trouble-shooting one.
   ``I'm not here because of those problems,'' he said. ``They are
being straightened out without me. I came because the Chinese have
invited me to celebrate my 90th birthday.'' Hammer turns 90 on May
21.
   Chinese President Yang Shangkun gave a banquet in Hammer's honor
tonight and Premier Li Peng invited him to a banquet Tuesday.
   Hammer said he hopes to sell Antaibo coal to South Korea, which
has no diplomatic relations with China but conducts a growing
indirect trade with it.
   He said South Korean officials have invited him to visit and
that he plans to bring up the subject of selling coal.
   Occidental officials said one of the contracts signed today
calls for construction of a coal preparation plant in central
China's Henan province with capacity to process 900,000 metric tons
of raw coal for coking. No date was given for construction to begin.
   Occidental holds a 55 percent share of the venture, while the
China Kang Hua Development Corp., a newly formed company under
Henan provincial control, has 45 percent.
   The other contract calls for use of Occidental technology at
four phosphoric acid plants to be built in China. The China Wuhan
Chemical Engineering Corp. and China National Chemical Construction
Co. were the purchasers.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Rose 2.5 Percent in March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rose 2.5 percent in
March, the second consecutive monthly increase in response to
falling mortgage interest rates, a real estate trade group said
Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.33 million units
last month
   ``Lower interest rates have stimulated activity, and the first
quarter has turned out better than we anticipated,'' John A.
Tuccillo, chief economist of the association, said in a statement.
   Rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages, which had risen above
11.5 percent before the October stock market crash, edged below 10
percent in February and March. They have been rising in April and
were 10.3 percent last week.
   The increase in March followed an identical 2.5 percent rise in
February and three consecutive monthly declines before that.
However, the sales level was still 9.8 percent below levels last
year when interest rates were at a nine-year low.
   Tuccillo said he expected home sales to rise again this month.
   The sales increase was accompanied by a 4.1 percent rise in
prices to a median, or midpoint, of $88,700, up from $88,100 in
February.
   Sales were led by a 9.6 percent advance in the West and a 6.7
percent boost in the South. Sales were unchanged in the Northeast
and down 3.4 percent in the Midwest.

<TEXT>
   A shopper landed in jail after an off-duty
policeman spotted him popping grapes in his mouth as he walked
through a supermarket produce section.
   ``They're taking me for eating grapes!'' Arthur Culberth yelled
as he was taken in handcuffs from a Winn-Dixie grocery store in the
predominantly black and impoverished Liberty City section of Miami.
   Culberth, 55, was charged Saturday with petty theft and
resisting arrest without violence. After spending the night in
jail, he was released with a promise to appear for a court date.
   Culberth, a plumber, said he broke open a $1.65 package of
grapes and plucked a couple into his mouth as he shopped with his
wife and stepson.
   Off-duty Miami policeman Roger Smith, who moonlights as a
security guard at the store, saw Culberth and told him he would
have to pay at once.
   ``He was given a chance to pay for the grapes and refused,''
Smith said. ``I had no other alternative.''
   But Culberth's wife, Linda, said the couple planned to pay for
the fruit when their $30 order was rung up.
   ``How in the world is it petty theft if we're shopping? It's
wrong, real wrong,'' she said of the arrest. ``We always pay our
bills.''
   Miami policeman Erol Stewart, who also moonlights at the store,
said Winn-Dixie has arrested about eight people in the past two
years for refusing to pay for food they had eaten.
   Earlier this month in Jackson, Mich., 52-year-old Eli Bradley
Jr. was charged with larceny from a building for allegedly eating
two pounds of grapes in a grocery store. Bradley, who could be
sentenced to four years in prison if convicted of the felony, said
he bought $14 worth of fruit in the store, and admitted he may have
sampled only one or two grapes.
   The prosecutor in Jackson said he filed the felony charge,
instead of misdemeanor shoplifting _ which carries a 90-day jail
term _ because several repeat shoplifters he's prosecuted have
received probation.

<HEAD>Officials Strip Brezhnev's Name From City Square</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities have stripped the name of
former President Leonid I. Brezhnev from a city square in the
capital of the republic of Kazakhstan.
   Brezhnev's name was dropped from the square in Alma Ata, the
biggest city in the Central Asian republic.
   An order from the Communist Party Central Committee, the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the government's Council of
Ministers dated April 1 was included in a booklet of latest
official orders received today by The Associated Press.
   The order did not indicate if a new name was chosen for the
square. It said the workers of Alma Ata had asked that Brezhnev's
name be removed from the square.
   A city, some neighborhoods, numerous factories, a tank division,
a military academy and other areas and institutions were named
after the Soviet president following his death in 1982.
   But, under the leadership of Soviet Communist Party chief
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Brezhnev has been blamed for a period of
stagnation and corruption in Soviet society.
   As a result, his name has been dropped in several instances.
   In January, a city of 460,000 people and a region of Moscow were
stripped of Brezhnev's name.
   Officials announced in February that Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri
Churbanov, would be tried for corruption.
   The weekly newspaper Nedelya renewed the attack on Brezhnev in
its latest weekend edition, charging that Brezhnev and members of
his circle gave each other valuable jewelry, limousines and furs.
   Ethnic rioting broke out in Alma Ata in December 1986 after
Gorbachev protege Dinmukamed Kunaev, an ethnic Kazakh, was replaced
by Gennady Kolbin, a Russian. At least two people died in the
rioting, and shops and cars were burned.

<HEAD>Zhao Ziyang Says Tibetan Separatists Will Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang said
today that China will deal forcefully with separatist movements,
such as the one in Tibet, and that such movements are doomed to
failure.
   ``Nowadays, a very small number of people are attempting to
split our motherland,'' Zhao said at a conference of 4,000 people
representing China's 56 nationalities.
   ``It is not difficult to see that they are not representing the
interests of our people, and they are only the agents of some
anti-Chinese foreign forces. Their vain attempt of splitting China
cannot possibly be realized.''
   Zhao did not mention Tibet by name but it was clear that he was
referring to the faraway province.
   The Tibetan capital of Lhasa erupted in pro-independence riots
last fall and again in March. The bloody protests were led by
Buddhist monks loyal to the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.
   Tibetan authorities have allowed almost no foreign journalists
into Tibet and released few details of action taken against
rioters. Sources in Lhasa have reported hundreds of arrests
following the March disturbance. Chinese officials say five people
died in the March riots. Unconfirmed reports have put the death
toll as high as 24.
   Zhao said China must carry out a two-pronged policy to promote
the interests of minority nationalities and ``forcefully oppose and
deal with any separatist efforts.'' His comments were carried by
the official Xinhua News Agency.
   Zhao told the gathering that discrimination against minority
ethnic groups is a problem everywhere in the world except China.
   He claimed China has banned discrimination against minorities,
protects them by law and grants them privileges not available to
Han Chinese, who comprise 92 percent of China's 1 billion people.
   Chinese minorities, which include 55 ethnic groups, were often
the victims of persecution during the first three decades of
Communist rule in China, when the government tried to eliminate
religious worship and local languages and customs.
   In the past decade Beijing has tried to redress some of the
wrongs of the past and now encourages minorities, many who live in
sparsely populated, strategic areas of western China, to retain
their traditions.
   Zhao is the author of a plan to give priority to economic
development of coastal China.
   There has been concern that Zhao's plan would further widen the
income gap between the coast, which is mostly Han Chinese, and the
interior where many minorities live in pockets of poverty.
   Zhao urged minorities to use foreign capital, science and
technology to develop their economies and compete in national and
international markets.

<HEAD>Residents Leap To Safety After Blast</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with people jumping from windows, new

   An explosion and fire ripped through a paint
store and spread to four other buildings, forcing residents to leap
through windows to safety as a building collapsed, authorities said
today. Twelve people, including five firefighters, were injured.
   At least 150 firefighters battled the blaze, which reached seven
alarms, and all off-duty firefighters were called in to provide
backup help at fire stations.
   ``There was an explosion and I was watching TV at the time. I
looked out the window and there was glass and debris scattered all
over the street, but no fire yet,'' said David Bedwell, 24, who
lived in a second-story apartment over the paint store.
   ``I opened the window and some people were shouting to me. I
just jumped and they caught me,'' said Bedwell, who was clad only
in his underwear.
   Caroline Boatman, who was at a bar a block and a half from the
explosion, said several patrons left and began shouting outside the
windows to awaken people in the neighborhood. She said several
people joined to catch residents who jumped when the building began
collapsing.
   ``People that were in the building, some of them on the third
floor, they said they felt the building drop,'' said Deputy Fire
Chief William Walker. ``The north wall dropped out and they jumped
to their safety.''
   One woman was in fair condition with a spinal injury suffered
when she jumped from a second-story window, according to St. Mary's
Hospital spokesman Steve Pinzer.
   Eleven others, including five firefighters and one police
officer, were treated for minor injuries and released, Pinzer said.
   ``It was very fortunate. They must have had a friend upstairs,''
said Walker.
   Ten people were evacuated from the building that collapsed and
numerous others were evacuated from their dwellings in the
neighborhood, said Police Lt. Donald Domagaleski said.
   The fire was still smoldering early today, and authorities said
it would be some time before investigators determined the cause.
Walker said a crane would be used to pull the wreckage apart
Tuesday.
   Jerry Frank, a fire battalion chief, said at least 150
firefighters were called to fight the blaze, which began after 11
p.m. Sunday and was brought under control about 2 a.m. today.
   The fire spread to at least two multifamily houses and Century
Hall, a 100-year-old tavern. Other buildings suffered some fire and
water damage.
   ``As we hear it, it's shot, but no one got hurt and that's
what's OK,'' said John Sidoff of Bayside, the owner of Century Hall.
   Sidoff said the three-story structure was entirely gutted by the
fire, including the hall's own on-site brewery.
   Sidoff, who has owned the building for six years, said it had
been used as a bowling alley, pool hall, bar and brewery during its
100-year history. The building also contained office space and a
ballroom.

   The pilot of a supersonic attack jet
underwent surgery today for critical injuries suffered when his
plane crashed during a performance at the Marine Corps Air Station
here, a hospital official said.
   Col. Jerry Cadick, 45, of Evansville, Ind., was performing a
loop maneuver Sunday when the F-A-18 Hornet crashed in front of a
crowd of 150,000, said Cpl. Kent Fletcher. None of the thousands of
spectators was injured, but the air show was immediately canceled.
   Cadick underwent surgery early today at Mission Regional Medical
Center in nearby Mission Viejo and remained in critical condition
with multiple injuries, said nursing supervisor Sonsee Bremner.
   The jet crashed but did not explode in a grassy area separating
a taxi way and a runway about 1,000 yards from the audience
watching the 38th annual Navy Relief Air Show, said Lt. Shawn
Cooper. The jet wasn't part of the Navy's Blue Angels precision
flying team, which performed before the crash.
   ``The jet crashed in between a taxi way and a runway in the
middle of the field,'' she said. The accident occurred about midway
through the show.
   ``The aircraft itself did not burn,'' said Gunnery Sgt. Peggy
Cauley. ``There was some fire there from the afterburners, but that
was in the grassy area and it was immediately extinguished.''
   Witness J.L. Eppstein, an Irvine police officer, was directing
traffic when the jet crashed.
   ``He came in low and kind of stalled. It was like he couldn't
get it going,'' Eppstein said. ``The tail hit the ground. He slid
for a ways and then hit a dirt mound. When he stalled, it was like
getting your car stuck in the mud.''
   Mike Tyszka of West Covina also witnessed the impact.
   ``We saw it hit the ground,'' he said. ``It looked like it lost
power. His nose was up and then all I saw was dust.''
   The F-A-18 is a twin-engine fighter-bomber flown by both Navy
and Marine pilots.
   The crash was the final blow to this year's planned two-day
event. Saturday's opening festivities were canceled when a
rainstorm swept through Southern California.
   The show is put on each year to aid the Navy Relief Society,
which allocates grants, provides interest-free loans and other
services to Navy personnel and their families.
   ``An investigation will be conducted to determine the cause (of
the crash),'' Staff Sgt. Steve Short said.
   It was the second major accident in three years at the yearly
show in this city about 50 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   On April 27, 1985, pilot Merrel Richard Gossman, 55, of Canoga
Park, a former Marine pilot who was demonstrating a vintage trainer
plane, and passenger Robert G. Arrowsmith, 25, a civilian stationed
at the El Toro station's medical clinic, were killed when the World
War II plane they were flying crashed into an empty church on base.
   Both were members of the Condor Squadron, an organization whose
members perform stunts during air shows. About 200,000 spectators
viewed the crash.

<HEAD>Man Dies After Setting Himself on Fire In Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MACON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police and worshippers who watched in horror
as a man set himself on fire during an evening church service
remain puzzled over why he soaked his clothing in gasoline, then
walked down the aisle in flames.
   Willie J. Boone, 41, of Macon died Sunday morning, about eight
hours after he torched himself at the Friendship Baptist Church. He
suffered burns over all of his body, said Bibb County Deputy
Coroner James Fain. Boone died at Medical Center of Central Georgia.
   The Rev. J.L Mills, pastor of the church, helped extinguish the
fire and told Boone to go back outside and get some air. There was
a lot of smoke in the church from the fire, and Mills said it was
making it difficult to breathe.
   ``He got up nice and easy, went out to the front and
collapsed,'' Mills said.
   The pastor said that Boone never hollered or cried _ he only
muttered, ``It's all right.''
   Police said they found an antifreeze container that apparently
held gasoline which Boone used to douse himself before lighting the
fire.
   Mills said a musical program was almost over when ``I saw the
children looking curious and I looked back'' from the first row.
   ``I saw this young man coming up the middle aisle ablaze of
fire,'' Mills said.
   Many in the church became hysterical, the pastor said. He added
that Boone was a stranger to the 40 to 50 people in the church
sanctuary.
   Police Capt. Robert Hernandez said investigators were continuing
to check into Boone's background Sunday, but had not come up with
any possible explanation for his actions.

   Investigators say it could be days before
they determine the cause of the explosions that killed five workers
and reduced a grain elevator complex to rubble.
   ``The cause is still undetermined,'' Joliet Fire Chief George
Plese said of the blasts Friday at the ADM Growmark granary on the
banks of the Des Plaines River.
   Rescue workers labored for 29 hours in search of three of the
victims, whose bodies were recovered Saturday, he said.
   The state fire marshal's office and the U.S. Occupational Safety
and Health Administration are investigating the two explosions,
Plese said.
   Dick Burket, a spokesman for Archer-Daniel-Midland Co., said
late Sunday the company's insurance and safety people also have an
investigation under way.
   Plese said OSHA impounded much of the structural steel from the
four silos destroyed by the blast.
   The last three of the five victims were found crumpled in the
basement of the granary, crushed by the wave of corn and soybeans
that swept them there, the chief said.
   They were identified as Donald E. Zack of Joliet, Daniel
McLaughlin, 18, of Manhattan and Michael Dupuis, 23, of
Bourbonnais, said Will County Deputy Coroner William Ferguson.
   ``As far as I can tell from the preliminary examinations at the
scene there was no burning on these bodies,'' Ferguson said
Saturday. ``Indications are that they would have died instantly
from the injuries.''
   The bodies of Mark Stewart, 20, of Princeton, and Dale Brent
Slatton, 28, of Newark, were found Friday.
   Officials ruled out a witness' report that the blasts blew a
worker off a barge and into the river, and a search of the river
was called off, Plese said.
   ``This is just one of those tragic things that should never
happen,'' said Dan Stewart, whose son was killed.
   For the Slatton family, the loss came on the heels of another
son's death in an auto accident less than a year ago.
   ``It's totally devastating to have three sons and to lose two,''
said the victim's mother, Carol.
   Three other people, including the elevator's manager and
assistant manager, were injured in the blasts. Only one, trucker
James Rayburn, remained hospitalized Sunday.
   Rayburn, who was pinned in his truck for 40 minutes when it was
buried with debris, was in fair condition at St. Joseph's Medical
Center in Joliet, said nursing supervisor Ida Dercoli.
   The blasts turned the 100-foot silos into mounds of twisted
steel, reinforced concrete and 70,000 bushels of corn and soybeans,
Plese said.
   ``We had to dig through all of that to get at these people who
were buried,'' he said by phone Sunday from Joliet.
   Local construction trade unions, trucking and wrecking companies
and nearby fire departments volunteered in the rescue effort, Plese
said.

<HEAD>Spiro Agnew Loses Supreme Court Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew lost a
Supreme Court appeal today in a lawsuit alleging he was cheated out
of more than $2 million for arranging a deal between a defense
contractor and the Argentine government.
   The justices, without comment, refused to order the setting
aside of more than $340,000 in a special fund Agnew and another
businessman would receive if they win the lawsuit.
   Agnew, an international business consultant, charged in a 1986
suit filed in federal court in New York City that he was cheated
out of a commission he earned for winning a telecommunications
contract for Aydin Corp. of Delaware.
   Agnew said Aydin Corp. and Alicanto S.A., an Argentine company,
retained him to help open doors in 1980 with the Argentine ruling
military junta.
   His suit said Alicanto was to recieve a 15 percent commission
from Aydin and then pay Agnew between one-third and one-half that
amount, more than $2 million.
   But Agnew alleged that Alicanto instead paid a $3.65 million
bribe to a ``bagman'' who passed it on to Argentine Air Force Gen.
Lami Dozo to help win the contract.
   Agnew said Alicanto then lied to him, claiming the deal fell
through when in fact Aydin won a $57 million contract to provide a
microwave communications system to the Argentine Air Force.
   Agnew and William H. Woolverton Jr., a former vice president of
Alicanto, are suing Alicanto and its president, William H. Shaw.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein last year refused to order
Alicanto and Shaw to place more than $340,000 in a fund that would
go to Agnew and Woolverton if they win their suit.
   In their appeal to the Supreme Court, Agnew and Woolverton said
Alicanto's assets now may be ``moved out of the United States and
most likely out of Argentina'' so that they will be out of reach of
any court judgment.
   Agnew, elected vice president in 1968 when Richard M. Nixon
headed the Republican ticket, resigned in 1973 after he was accused
of accepting bribes and kickbacks while a Baltimore County
executive in Maryland.
   He pleaded no contest to tax evasion in that case.
   Agnew said in his suit against Alicanto and Shaw that he was
cheated out of the commission by people who believed his past
reputation would bar him from winning any case in court.
   Agnew said he was told by a lawyer who worked for Aydin that
``nobody would believe him if he sued (because of) prior events
related to his holding public office.''
   The case is Agnew vs. Alicanto, 87-1464.

<DATELINE>ARBOR VITAE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tensions over Indian fishing rights
rose as about 60 protesters carrying signs and an American flag
harassed Chippewa spearfishers on a northern Wisconsin lake.
   ``If they (spearfishing opponents) keep up what they're doing,
they're going to have spears in them,'' Tom Maulson, a Lac du
Flambeau tribal judge and spearfishing organizer, said Sunday.
   A Department of Natural Resources official said the tension at
Big Arbor Vitae Lake was increased by the presence of a Republican
congressional candidate. The candidate, Kevin Hermening, said the
controversy is an issue of citizenship.
   ``We can't have separate rights for special groups of people
based on age, gender or race,'' Hermening told the cheering
protesters Sunday night.
   The Indians' right to spearfish in off-reservation lakes has
been upheld in federal court, but protesters say the fishing
damages stocks and hurts sportfishing, a major industry here.
   The crowd traded verbal jabs with Indians and wardens from the
Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission took a boat out on
the water to count, measure and record the sex of fish rather than
face possible confrontation when they were brought to shore.
   Counting fish on the water ``may well avoid another time of a
possible confrontation,'' said George Meyer, DNR chief
administrator of enforcement. He said spearfishing opponents become
more upset and vocal when fish are counted.
   State wardens planned to cite one of about 15 non-Indian boats
on the lake with causing a hazardous wake, said Meyer. Officials
also were considering whether to cite the boater with harassment.
No one was injured in the incident, Meyer said.
   An Indian report of a gunshot heard on Catfish Lake in Vilas
County was turned over to the county Sheriff's Department for
investigation, said Dale Urso, DNR north-central district director.
   This was the fourth year the Chippewa have exercised their
right, retained in 19th century treaties, to harvest resources in
northern Wisconsin lands ceded to the United States.
   Protests have been violent in previous years, including shots
fired at some lakes in 1986. No serious injuries have been
reported, and a cadre of officers aided by a National Guard chopper
is helping keep the peace this year.
   Each Indian band is allowed 15 days of spearing and may take no
more than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lake's fish
population can tolerate. The season ends May 6.
   The Indians fish at night, using lanterns to help them find
fish, which they catch with spears up to eight feet long.
Protesters say this is an unfair way to fish.
   Meyer attributed the number of non-Indian boats on Big Arbor
Vitae and some of the tension to the organized protest and
Hermening's presence.
   He said there was a ``marked difference'' in the tension after
Hermening returned from a boat ride to address the crowd.
   ``His presence ... increased the size of the crowd and in
particular, some of his discussion after the boat came back in, in
my mind, did increase some of the tension,'' Meyer said.

<HEAD>Soviets Report Industrial Production Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet industrial production increased by 5
percent in the first three months of 1988 as reforms requiring many
factories and firms to operate on a self-sustaining basis went into
effect, Radio Moscow said today.
   The official radio said Nikolai Belov, deputy head of the State
Committee on Statistics, reported the production increase exceeded
the 4.5 percent target set in state plans.
   However, it said ``production targets have not been met as
regards a number of major commodities, and the quality of many of
the goods is still substandard.''
   The brief report did not specify the problem areas of the
economy, or areas of success.
   It said the national income increased by 4 percent. National
income is a measurement of economic activity that differs from
gross national product in not considering the value of some
services.
   As of Jan. 1, state-run factories and farms responsible for 60
percent of the Soviet Union's production were required to depend on
themselves for the revenue they need to operate.
   That is one of the key elements of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
economic reforms, which are aimed at giving local managers more
responsibility and flexibility. The Communist Party general
secretary wants to limit central authorities to overall planning of
the economy rather than exercising direct control over the
production plans and quotas of factories and farms.
   Industries and farms operating under the new requirements ``are
performing better than those working in the old way,'' Radio Moscow
said.
   The radio report came as U.S. intelligence agencies in
Washington released a report saying Gorbachev's reforms ran into
serious obstacles in 1987.
   A joint report by the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Defense Intelligence Agency said the Soviet gross national product
increased only 0.5 percent in 1987, compared with a 3.9 percent
increase the previous year.
   It cited the poor performance in 1987 to poor weather that hurt
farm production and resistance to change in the Soviet bureaucracy.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
giving federal prison wardens more power to decide what
publications inmates may read.
   The court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority
of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars.
   One of the prisoners in the case is Jack Henry Abbott, a
convicted murderer and bank robber who achieved notoriety after he
was befriended by Norman Mailer and other prominent writers and
editors.
   Six weeks after Abbott was freed in a work-release program in
1981, he stabbed to death an aspiring actor outside of a New York
City restaurant where the victim was working as a waiter. Abbott's
book on prison life, ``In the Belly of the Beast,'' was critically
acclaimed.
   Abbott is among prisoners who challenged federal regulations
restricting publications that may be sent to inmates.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here ruled last July that the
rules go too far in giving wardens control over what publications
inmates may subscribe to or receive.
   The appeals court ordered further trial court hearings, where
officials will have to prove that 46 publications should be banned
because they threaten security, order or rehabilitation.
   The free-expression rights of inmates require that officials
shoulder the burden of proof when they seek to ban publications,
the appeals court said.
   Among the publications officials tried to ban were, for example,
an issue of The Call, a left-wing newspaper that included an
article charging ``inhumane treatment ... by racist guards'' in
federal prisons.
   Officials at a federal penitentiary in Atlanta said the article
``is considered not to be in the best interest of discipline, good
order and security.''
   But the appeals court said that is an insufficient reason to ban
the publication. The officials failed to prove ``the material
encouraged conduct which would constitute, or otherwise was likely
to produce, a breach of security or order or an impairment of
rehabilitation.''
   The same limits on official power should apply to sexually
explicit material, the appeals court said.
   Also, the appeals court said censoring parts of a publication is
less restrictive than banning the newspaper or magazine entirely.
``Rejecting an entire publication where a part is objectionable is
inconsistent with the First Amendment,'' the appeals court said.
   The Constitution's First Amendment ensures freedom of speech.
   The Reagan administration urged the Supreme Court to restore
fully the prison regulations.
   ``While a warden may have a legitimate fear that a particular
publication will cause problems, he will rarely be able to prove a
likelihood of violence or disorder as a result of the admission of
a publication,'' Justice Department lawyers said.
   They cited uprisings last year by inmates from Cuba in two U.S.
prisons as evidence ``that information from the outside can, in
some circumstances, have grave consequences within a prison.''
   The government also argued that the number of publications
excluded is small.
   Between Sept. 1, 1986 and Aug. 31, 1987 some 1,728 publications
were withheld out of 1.8 million sent to federal inmates, the
government's appeal said.
   The groups challenging the prison regulations are the Prisoners'
Union, Weekly Guardian Associates and the Revolutionary Socialist
League.
   The case is Meese vs. Abbott, 87-1344.

   Williams College administrators
resumed talks today with protesters who are occupying a dean's
office and demanding more attention to the education of racial
minorities.
   Talks began at 7 a.m., barely six hours after negotiators broke
from a previous meeting, college spokesman James Kolesar said.
   The two sides had met for two hours Sunday afternoon, with
Williams President Francis C. Oakley taking part, then reconvened
at 9:15 p.m. and talked into the early morning hours.
   Representatives of both sides called the Sunday talks
``constructive.''
   The students, members of a group called the Coalition Against
Racist Education, took over the Jenness House on Friday morning and
issued 13 demands that included the hiring by the prestigious
liberal arts school of more minority faculty members and the
admitting of more minority students, while incorporating more
minority perspectives into the curriculum.
   ``They're responsive to us,'' said one of the student
negotiators, Monique Waddell, 19, a sophomore from New York City,
referring to the administration representatives that included Dean
Stephen Fix and Provost Neil Grabois.
   ``The meeting is showing some progress,'' she said. ``There's
not a sense of negativity. The energy that is flowing is
constructive, so that's good.''
   She added, ``It's just a matter of getting them to understand us
better.''
   The talks were conducted in the physics building, adjacent to
the Jenness House.
   Minority students comprise 13 percent of the 2,000-member
student body. The protesters include students from Asia, the
Caribbean and the Pacific islands as well as American blacks and
Hispanics.
   About 10 percent of the 278-member faculty belongs to a minority
group.
   Sunday, administration officials and the protesters discussed
three of the demands. These were: establishing full scholarships
for low-income minority students from urban areas; creating a
campus cultural center for minority groups, and hiring a special
assistant to the president to recruit more minority teachers.
   School spokesman Jim Kolesar said the administration would not
comment specifically on the talks but he called the discussions
``constructive.''
   While the negotiations were under way, a young white man was
seen taping a sign saying ``Quality, Not Quotas'' on a window at
Jenness, with the words facing inside the house. It was later
removed.
   Freshman Jillian Charles, who spent Saturday night inside the
house, said she heard rocks being thrown at the building.
   Jenness House, which serves as the dean's office while the main
administration building is being renovated, is tucked in a corner
of the campus, making the protest less conspicuous. While some of
the hundreds of parents visiting over the Parents' Weekend
expressed concern and even support for the protest, they largely
spent the weekend undisturbed by it, said Ellen Berek, news
director for the school.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Property Owners' Rights in Wyoming Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that property owners' rights are not violated when they are
required to remove structures that could interfere with low-flying
planes.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' rejected an appeal by a Cheyenne, Wyo., man fined $200
a day for refusing to trim a 48-foot cottowood tree on his property.
   Terry Rogers, the tree owner, said a Cheyenne ordinance imposing
a height limit on structures near the local airport is
unconstitutional because it takes property without just
compensation.
   His tree, at 48 feet, would have to be cut to 25 or 30 feet to
comply with the ordinance. Rogers said that would kill the tree,
costing him $2,064.
   After he lost an earlier challenge to the ordinance's
constitutionality, Rogers was found guilty of violating city law
and fined $200 a day beginning Nov. 20, 1986.
   Court documents did not indicate the total fine assessed against
Rogers.
   The Wyoming Supreme Court last December upheld the fine,
rejecting claims that the air space above Rogers' property belonged
to him.
   The state court also rejected Rogers' argument that because the
tree was in place prior to enactment of the ordinance he was
entitled to keep it.
   The state court said the local law ``allows for the continuance
of a non-conforming use. It does not allow the expansion of a
pre-existing non-conforming use.''
   ``In other words,'' the state court said, ``a violation occurred
if the tree was allowed to grow higher than it stood in October
1974 when the ordinance was adopted.''
   The tree has grown some 18 feet since the fall of 1974, the
state court said.
   The justices in 1986 rejected a related appeal by Rogers.
   The case is Rogers vs. Cheyenne, 87-1462.

<HEAD>Court Turns Away Missouri Sex Discrimination Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned away a case in
which Missouri officials were found guilty of sex discrimination by
not hiring enough women as highway maintenance workers.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by state
officials who said lower courts improperly weighed the evidence.
   The justices also refused to hear an appeal by women who said
remedies ordered by the lower courts were inadequate.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September said there
was adequate evidence for a federal jury to find that the Missouri
Highway and Transportation Commission discriminated against women
in the state's eighth district.
   The verdict was based partly on anecdotal evidence and partly on
statistics that showed the number of women maintenance workers in
the district was a small fraction of the women in the regional work
force.
   The appeals court said that from Jan. 1, 1975, through May 31,
1980, the state hired eight women as maintenance workers and 89 men
for those jobs.
   During that period women comprised up to 48 percent of the work
force, the appeals court noted.
   Missouri officials interpreted the statistics differently. They
said only 312 women applied for maintenance work compared to 3,566
men during that period. The state said it hired 2.6 percent of the
female applicants and 2.5 percent of the men who applied.
   But the 8th Circuit court said the equal hiring rate did not
prove the state was innocent of bias.
   A judge and jury ``were free to weigh the inference of
non-discrimination arising from the hiring rate against the
inference of discrimination arising from the anecdotal and
statistical evidence,'' the appeals court said. It added the
evidence was sufficient to support a verdict that the state
``engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against
women.''
   The appeals court upheld a ruling that some 150 women may share
in back pay to be awarded by the state. The group is made up of
women who were qualified to be hired as maintenance workers if the
state had not discriminated on the basis of sex.
   But the appeals court overturned a portion of a federal judge's
ruling that Missouri hire from 37 percent to 48 percent women for
future maintenance worker openings.
   The 8th Circuit court ordered the hiring goal ``replaced by a
generalized injunction prohibitng further discrimination'' against
women.
   The appeals court also refused to order the state to hire four
women who were among the first to charge the state with
discrimination, and it declined to extend its ruling beyond the
eighth district to make it statewide.
   The Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative group, and
officials from Wisconsin and Wyoming said the finding of
discrimination against Missouri could have far-reaching
consequences.
   They said the charges were based on questionable statistical
evidence. The eligible work force consisted of all working women
between ages 18 and 70 who had driver's licenses and an eighth
grade education, they noted.
   ``This labor pool is too broad because it failed to consider
only those individuals willing and able to do the work in
question,'' they said.
   The cases are Missouri Highway Commission vs. Catlett, 87-1415,
and Catlett vs. Missouri Highway Commission, 87-1416.

   An Israeli court today sentenced John Demjanjuk
to be executed for war crimes committed as ``Ivan the Terrible,'' a
sadistic Nazi guard who ran gas chambers where about 800,000 Jews
died.
   ``He was a chief hangman who with his own hands killed tens of
thousands with cruelty ... We sentence him to death,'' said Judge
Zvi Tal. Onlookers clapped and shouted as the sentence was
announced. Some chanted ``Bravo.'' Others shouted: ``Death, death.''
   Last week, the court convicted the 68-year-old retired Ohio
autoworker of Nazi war crimes. It said he was responsible for the
deaths of thousands of Jews at the Treblinka concentration camp in
Nazi-occupied Poland. About 800,000 Jews died in 1942 and 1943,
when ``Ivan'' worked at the camp.
   Only one man has ever been executed in Israel's 40-year history.
Adolf Eichmann, architect of the Holocaust, was hanged in 1962.
   Court Spokesman Yossi Hassin said Demjanjuk would most likely be
hanged. ``If the sentence is upheld on appeal, the expectation is
he would be hanged,'' Hassin said.
   Demjanjuk attended today's sentences in a wheelchair,
complaining of back problems. He entered the courtroom moments
before the verdict was read, shouting in Hebrew: ``I am innocent.''
   A Christian, he was seen making the sign of the cross and
whispering to himself, apparently praying, during arguments from
prosecutors who demanded the death penalty.
   After the verdict he was wheeled away, expressionless and ringed
by riot police.
   Demjanjuk's lawyers have said they will appeal his conviction to
the Supreme Court. Today's sentence followed a trial that lasted 14
months.
   Yosef Czarny, a Treblinka survivor who testified against
Demjanjuk, said that although ``a thousand deaths cannot compensate
for what happened ... at least we have judged one of the Angels of
Death.''
   ``I feel like a burden has been lifted,'' said Pinchas Epstein,
another Holocaust survivor.
   Tal's statement after three hours of judicial deliberation drew
applause and whistling from hundreds of Israelis in the audience,
including survivors of the Holocaust.
   Several hundred onlookers crowded into the converted movie
theater to hear the verdict. Earlier, longtime observers said they
expected the death penalty because of the sweeping guilty verdict
which discounted each defense argument.
   ``There is no forgiveness in the law or the heart ...
(Holocaust) victims are still crying out to us,'' said Tal, who was
born in Poland. ``Even a thousand deaths cannot compensate.''
   Demjanjuk's son, 22-year-old John Jr., said his family had
expected a death sentence.
   ``It amounts to nothing less than the judicial murder of an
innocent man,'' he said. ``It will bring shame to the state of
Israel, the Israeli Justice Department, the U.S. Justice
Department, and most unfortunately the six million victims of the
Nazi Holocaust.''
   Earlier in the day, his father told the three-judge panel it was
making a ``very, very, very big mistake.''
   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk has consistently alleged he is a
victim of mistaken identity, although he admitted lying on his
American emigration papers about his past. He contends he was held
in a Nazi prisoner of war camp during the critical period in
question.
   ``I am not Ivan the Terrible, and to that God is the most just
witness. He knows I am innocent,'' Demjanjuk told the court today.
He spoke in Ukrainian.
   The court adjourned briefly after Demjanjuk spoke to allow the
judges time to consider the arguments.
   The defense also had pleaded against a death sentence.
   ``There is also a question of an individual's holocaust,'' said
defense attorney John Gill of Cleveland. ``The taking of any
innocent human life is a holocaust.''
   Opening the proceedings today, prosecutor Yona Blattman told the
three judges that Demjanjuk ``was not a small cog in the Nazi
machine, he was a major criminal, an arch-henchman.''
   ``We maintain the only punishment that can be imposed on the
accused is the death penalty,'' Blattman argued.
   Demjanjuk pointed to his chest, shaking his head no, as Blattman
alleged that Demjanjuk had ``distinguished himself by the sheer
brutality of his behavior ... beating Jews mercilessly with a sword
or whip.''
   Gill said the conviction could be shown at a later date to have
been incorrect and he cited previous wrongful convictions. The
problem with the death penalty, he said, is that it ``is in fact
irrevocable.''
   In its verdict last week, the tribunal convicted Demjanjuk
``without hesitation or doubt'' of being the brutal guard at
Treblinka.
   The three judges said Demjanjuk ``killed masses of human beings
with his own hands,'' frequently exceeding the brutality ordered by
Nazi commanders.
   Nazi war crimes and terrorism are the only offenses punishable
by death in the Jewish state.
   During the trial, five Holocaust survivors identified Demjanjuk,
of suburban Cleveland, as the Nazi guard who operated Treblinka's
gas chambers.
   Justice Minister Avraham Sharir had urged the death penalty for
Demjanjuk, saying ``a man convicted of such terrible crimes
deserves no other sentence.''

   President Hafez Assad today met PLO Chief
Yasser Arafat at the presidential palace, only the second time the
Arab leaders have come face-to-face since Arafat was expelled from
Syria five years ago.
   Presidential spokesman Jibran Kourieh said Assad and Arafat
began meeting at 5 p.m. (10 a.m. EDT) at Assad's Mohajirine palace.
   The session follows the assassination of Arafat's top deputy _
Khalil Wazir _ and was seen as a step toward a reconciliation
between Assad and Arafat.
   Assad and Arafat last met at the Arab summit last November in
Amman, Jordan. The Palestine Liberation Organization chief was
accompanied to today's meeting by seven senior aides, Kourieh said.
   Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria also attended the
meeting, the presidential spokesman said.
   Arafat earlier met with other Palestinian leaders to prepare for
the crucial session with Assad.
   George Habash, leader of the Marxist Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said that three-hour meeting ``touched on
all issues'' Arafat would discuss with Assad.
   Arafat arrived in Damascus from Libya on Sunday.
   Arafat was accompanied by Col. Mustafa Kharroubi, a senior aide
to Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. Syria's official media
reported Kharroubi met with Assad today, but gave no details.
   Gadhafi and President Hadli Benjedid of Algeria had accelerated
efforts to reconcile Assad and Arafat after Wazir was assassinated
in Tunisia on April 16, apparently by an Israeli commando unit.
   Wazir, 52, was buried in Damascus last Wednesday. Arafat, his
long-time comrade and co-founder of the guerrilla movement, did not
attend because of his feud with Assad.
   A reconciliation between Arafat and Assad, two of the key
figures in the Arab conflict with Israel, would do much to forge
Arab unity.
   Arab leaders have been trying for years to get Assad and Arafat
to make up their differences. While Wazir's assassination was a
severe blow to the PLO, most Arab leaders believe it has
accelerated efforts to reconcile Syria and the PLO.
   In addition to Habash, today's PLO meeting at the Rawda guest
palace included Nayef Hawatmeh, secretary-general of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine; Suleiman Najjab, leader of
the Palestinian Communist Party and Salah Khalaf, the No. 2 man in
Fatah, the largest PLO faction.
   Hawatmeh told reporters that ``we all agreed that this a rare
opportunity'' for reconciliation with Syria, which expelled Arafat
in June 1983 amid a mutiny within the PLO inspired by Damascus.
   He said there was a ``unanimous belief'' among the Palestinians
that ``this opportunity would lead to the restoration of warm
relations between Syria and the PLO'' and bolster the 4{-month-old
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Wazir was popular with both Arafat loyalists and pro-Syrian
dissidents. Palestinian factions, divided since the PLO-Syrian
rift, all denounced his killing and vowed revenge.
   Wazir, known as Abu Jihad, was the apparent mastermind of the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.

<HEAD>Ford Foundation Plans New Organization To Help AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ford Foundation is organizing and helping
finance an umbrella organization to give financial assistance to
AIDS patients and their families, a newspaper reports.
   The foundation, the nation's wealthiest, was expected to
announce today the formation of the National-Community AIDS
Partnership, The New York Times said.
   The partnership is designed to pool the resources of the Ford
Foundation, corporate donors and other philanthropies to help local
organizations across the country provide housing, day care,
counseling, and education for victims of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and their families.
   The announcement was expected at the annual conference of the
Council on Foundations, which opens today in Los Angeles, the
newspaper said.
   In addition to providing funds, the Ford Foundation hopes that
its own status will attract organizations and corporations that
have been reluctant to become involved in AIDS funding.
   Shepard Forman, a Ford Program director, acknowledged that major
foundations have been slow to respond to the AIDS crisis.
   ``I feel we all should have been there with an appropriate
response five years ago but we were not,'' he said. ``We're there
now and the question is how do we get others to join us.''
   The Ford Foundation will make an initial contribution of $2
million to the partnership. Smaller sums will be contributed by
other philanthropies in the partnership, including the Kaiser
Family Foundation, $200,000; the Rockefeller Foundation and the
Gannett Foundations, $100,000 each; and the Xerox Foundation and
the Aetna Life and Casualty Foundation, $50,000 each annually for
two years.
   The partnership will be administered by the National AIDS
Network, a Washington group which helps 450 community-based AIDS
organizations.
   Community foundations in nine regions have agreed to raise from
$100,000 to $500,000 to match contributions made by the national
partners for a total of about $8 million. More community groups are
expected to join the partnership later this year.
   The nine regions are the New York-New Jersey area; southern and
northern California; the Southwest; Hartford, Conn.; Washington,
D.C.; Atlanta; Minnesota; and Cleveland.

<HEAD>Six Arrested At Rocky Flats Nuclear Protest Reunion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six activists were arrested for blocking a
railroad track at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant during a
reunion of protesters who were at a massive demonstration 10 years
ago.
   ``There wasn't any planned civil disobedience. It was all
spontaneous,'' activist Ellen Klaver said of Sunday's protest.
``The attitude of the police had a lot to do with it. They were so
rigid.''
   The demonstrators marched 10 miles from Boulder to Rocky Flats,
where about 150 people who gathered on the tracks for then, pitched tents
and danced the ``Hokey Pokey.'' Many had
participated in protests that began A 10-year
reuniopril 29, 1978, when dozens
were arrested.
   Longtime peace activist Daniel Ellsberg told the small reunion
Sunday the militaristic ``cold war'' mentality that made Ronald
Reagan president eight years ago is receding before a resurgence of
pacifism.
   The plant, 16 miles northwest of Denver, makes plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons. It is operated by Rockwell
International Corp. for the U.S. Department of Energy.
   The protesters were ordered to leave five times Sunday by a
guard. Most backed away from the tracks, but the six continued to
chant and dance.
   ``Most people do not support nuclear weapons,'' one activist
shouted at the guards. ``You have no right to be here. You're
participating in murder.'. ``I'd never done anything like that before.
We
really got to know each other because of our common cause. We were
very supportive and loving.''
   Dorskind said he is not as impulsive today as he was then. ``I'm
much more careful about the decisions I make. I'm not ready to turn
my head so fast, just because somebody gives a liberal rap.''

<TEXT>
   A young man wearing gang colors was shot
to death by a man wearing a rival gang's insignia while waiting in
line to see ``Colors,'' the first fatality linked to the much
criticized movie about out-of-control street gangs.
   Police were seeking the suspect, a man in his 20s, who fatally
shot the 19-year-old victim Sunday afternoon while he stood in line
at a cinema in this community east of San Francisco.
   The movie depicts the rival Los Angeles-based Crips and Bloods
gangs. The suspect was wearing a red handkerchief, as do members of
the Bloods, while the victim had on a blue handkerchief, signifying
the Crips, authorities said.
   The bullet hit a 17-year-old girl after it passed through the
victim's head, but she was not seriously injured, said Stockton
Police Lt. David Swim.
   ``Colors'' opened nationwide April 15 at 425 theaters amid
protests and tight security following predictions of audience
violence.
   In Los Angeles, arrests were made after minor scuffles at two
theaters on the film's opening night. And in Colma, south of San
Francisco, police ordered a downtown theater to stop showing the
movie because crowds nearly got out of hand opening night.
   Sunday's incident began when the victim was standing in line
with his brother-in-law and girlfriend, said Swim, reading a
statement.
   The suspect and at least two male companions drove by the
theater, then returned and parked, said Swim. The suspect got out
and approached the victim and asked, ``Are you a ricket?''
   Swim said ricket is a derogatory term for Crips members.
   Swim said the victim's girlfriend stepped between the two and
told the suspect they did not want any trouble. The suspect then
turned toward the car when his two companions began fighting with
the victim's brother-in-law.
   As the victim went to the aid of his brother-in-law, the suspect
returned and pointed a gun at him, said Swim. The victim began to
run, but the suspect fired one shot that hit the victim in the head.
   ``Colors,'' starring Sean Penn and Robert Duvall, opened to
large crowds at many theaters April 15, but little of the
anticipated violence materialized.
   The Guardian Angels, the self-styled citizen crime-fighters,
were among those claiming the film glorified gangs and would prompt
violence.
   Charles O. Glenn, executive vice president of Orion Pictures,
the film's distributor, recently defended the movie.
   ``If there is anything this picture does not do, it does not
glorify gangs or gang violence.'' Glenn said.
   Authorities have kept a presence at theaters in Los Angeles and
other places with known gangs during screening of the movie.
   In Los Angeles, three people were killed over the weekend in
gang-related attacks not connected to the movie, including an
alleged gang member who was killed Sunday after he shot a sheriff's
deputy in the back.
   The Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy was saved by a
bulletproof vest, said Deputy Roxanna Schuchman. The deputy then
returned fire and killed the alleged gang member, whose name was
not released.
   In other gang violence, a 17-year-old man was stabbed to death
Friday night and another man was fatally wounded in a drive-by
shooting early Saturday, police said.

   Church officials turned away a woman and her
troubled 9-year-old son from services at an Episcopal church,
enforcing a court order barring them because of the boy's
disruptive behavior.
   ``This is God's church, not your church,'' Sheryl Geartz quietly
told the half-dozen men who blocked the door Sunday at Grace
Episcopal Cathedral.
   Ms. Geartz prayed aloud before leaving: ``Dear Lord, we know
this is your house. We ask you to open your doors to let us in. In
Jesus' name, we pray.''
   She then took her son and 7-year-old daughter to another church.
   The cathedral had obtained a restraining order in Shawnee County
District Court last week that barred her and her son Jason on the
grounds that the boy disrupts services and his mother will not
control him.
   The church's petition for a restraining order described Jason's
``disruptive and dangerous activities,'' such as pulling the fire
alarm, making loud noises, throwing objects and destroying property.
   Ms. Geartz admits that Jason has misbehaved, but she says he has
emotional problems and that taking him to church every week has
improved his conduct.
   The dean of Grace Cathedral, the Very Rev. Robert R. Shahan,
said at a news conference later Sunday that the church worked with
Ms. Geartz for seven months to try to restrain Jason.
   ``The level of disturbance moved from being merely annoying to
being utterly intolerable,'' said Shahan.
   Some church members stopped attending services or stopped taking
communion because of the disruptions, Shahan said.
   ``We were faced with a situation in which one person had
determined her needs were paramount to the needs of the entire
congregation,'' he said. ``Our duty, as we see it, must be to the
congregation as a whole.''
   Church officials were unable to find a solution Ms. Geartz would
accept to control the boy, Shahan said. The dean, the head
clergyman of the cathedral, said he expected criticism from people
who would ask, ``Is getting a restraining order what a loving,
caring Christian community does?''
   ``The answer is, this is what a loving, caring Christian
community does, after seven months of trying to help, to no
avail,'' he said.
   Ms. Geartz said she was aware that she was under court order not
to appear at Grace Cathedral, but she said she went to take a stand
for people who are emotionally disturbed.
   ``Where will it stop?'' she said. ``If they ban my son from this
church, are they going to ban other children and even adults who
have emotional problems?''
   Ms. Geartz said she would pray before deciding whether to
attempt to attend services next week.

<HEAD>Parrot Succumbs To Teflon Fumes After Alerting Owner Of Fire</HEAD>

   An African gray parrot alerted her owner
by calling out his name when a Teflon-coated pan caught fire, but
died from the fumes after the fire was extinguished.
   A veterinarian said burning Teflon has been found to cause
respiratory arrest in birds.
   Chris Barnes, a University of Colorado student, said 7-year-old
Coco died exactly one year after his mother, Barbara Barnes Givens
of Aurora, gave him the bird as a birthday present.
   Barnes, 21, who shares a house with five other students in
Boulder, said one roommate arrived home early Saturday and put a
pot of water on the stove to make spaghetti.
   Barnes said the roommate went to his room and made a telephone
call, then fell asleep while the water boiled away.
   Barnes said about 4:30 a.m. he heard Coco screeching in the
living room, next to the kitchen, and then calling his name.
   He got up and found the kitchen was filled with smoke and the
Teflon lining of the red-hot pot was aflame.
   Barnes said he put out the fire and aired out the room, then
checked on Coco and found that the bird appeared to be all right.
But several minutes later, he said, he found the bird on the floor
of her cage.
   Coco was valued at $1,000, could whistle the theme from the
movie ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,'' and had a life expectancy
of more than 100 years.
   ``This is really tragic,'' Barnes said. ``I was going to put her
into my will'' to provide for future care.
   Veterinarian William Dernell said Coco's death is typical of
other bird deaths involving Teflon cookware.
   He said an Illinois veterinarian has found that burning Teflon
on cookware can release noxious fumes that cause respiratory arrest
in birds.
   ``It doesn't take much,'' Dernell said. ``In some cases no
burning has to take place. If the Teflon gets hot enough, noxious
fumes can be released and respiratory arrest (in birds) can occur.''

   The United States is asking the government of
South Korea to give more money for the support of 43,000 American
troops stationed there, an administration source said today.
   A team of Pentagon and State Department officials will
officially raise the request in June at the next round of regularly
scheduled talks with South Korea in Seoul, said the official. He
asked not to be identified.
   ``We will be talking about increased direct support,'' he said.
``One reason we feel they should increase their contribution is
their economic performance. The other is our own budget problems,''
he said.
   South Korea has enjoyed an economic boom in recent years, with a
record $9.78 billion account surplus last year. South Korea's trade
surplus with the United States grew 39 percent in 1987.
   South Korea now contributes more than $100 million annually for
the upkeep of the U.S. force, said the official.
   In 1985, South Korea paid $34 million in direct funds for the
upkeep of the U.S. forces, said the official. It also contributed
about $1 billion indirectly through tax and rent exemptions for the
public lands used by the U.S. military, he said.
   The United States is asking the Seoul government for an increase
of $120 million, but the South Koreans would be willing to give
only $60 million more
   at most, The Washington Post reported today. The official
refused to discuss those figures.
   Many South Koreans have been angered by reports of the U.S.
request, saying that although the trade figures favor their
country, its residents are relatively poor by Western standards.
South Korea's per capita income is $3,000 annually, compared with
about $17,500 in the United States.
   U.S. officials are also concerned that as South Korea builds up
its military strength it will no longer want U.S. help to protect
the country against Communist North Korea.
   ``We must keep our troops there to counter the northern
threat,'' said the American official. ``There's no doubt about
that.''
   Without U.S. troops, the South Korean military is weaker than
its northern neighbor, which enjoys the support of the Soviet Union
and China.

   A passenger train today raced through
a station where it was supposed to stop and then derailed. Danish
television said seven people were killed and 67 injured.
   ``There are several overturned cars, partly on top of each
other,'' Assistant Police Commissioner Palle Hasselgren told Danish
radio.
   The radio reported the train, traveling from Fredricia to
Copenhagen, derailed as it was to return to the main track from a
side rail which was used because of repair work.
   The train was not scheduled to stop for passengers at the small
rural station at Soroe, but was supposed to halt because of the
track change. Instead it went through the station at high speed,
the radio said.
   The engine and the two first cars flew off the track, causing
the following five cars to overturn, the report said.
   The derailment occurred about 50 miles southwest of Copenhagen.
   The express train, with a capacity of 300 people, was nearly
full. However, a group of children on their way to school got off
at the station before Soroe, the radio said. Many passengers were
businessmen from Funen island on their way to the Danish capital.
   Police helicopters and air force planes were called in to help
evacuate casualties.
   The dead were not immediately identified. Their nationalities
were not known.

   The Supreme Court said today it will consider
overturning a key civil rights precedent allowing people to sue
private citizens accused of racial discrimination. Four dissenting
justices accused the court of undermining the trust minority groups
have in it.
   The court, in an extraordinary move, said it will use a North
Carolina case involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment to
consider throwing out a 12-year-old decision.
   In a strongly worded dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said
minority groups may feel betrayed by the court's order calling for
re-examination of the 1976 case.
   ``In addition to the impact of today's decision on the faith of
victims of racial discrimination in a stable construction of the
civil rights laws, the order must also have a detrimental and
enduring impact on the public's perception of the court as an
impartial adjudicator,'' Stevens said.
   He also accused the five justices in the majority of indulging
in unwise activism by agreeing to review an issue that was not
raised by either side in the North Carolina case.
   ``If the court decides to cast itself adrift from the
constraints imposed by the adversary process and to fashion its own
agenda, the consequences for the nation _ and for the future of
this court as an institution _ will be even more serious than any
temporary encouragement of previously rejected forms of racial
discrimination,'' Stevens continued.
   ``The court has inflicted a serious _ and unwise _ wound upon
itself today,'' he said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun
and Thurgood Marshall.
   The majority said the dissenters were making it sound like the
court was overturning the 1976 decision.
   ``We have of course done no such thing,'' the majority said.
``It is surely no affront to settled jurisprudence to request
argument on whether a particular precedent should be modified or
overruled.''
   The court took the unusual step of calling for reargument of the
racial harassment case in a three-page, unsigned order.
   The case, argued on Feb. 29, now will be held over until the
court's 1988-89 term beginning in October.
   Voting to rehear the case and expand its scope were Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   The case stems from an appeal by Brenda Patterson, a black
woman, who wants to use a post-Civil War law to force her employer,
McClean Credit Union, to pay actual and punitive damages for
alleged harassment.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1986 upheld a ruling by
a federal judge in Winston-Salem, N.C., throwing out her suit.
   The appeals court said Ms. Patterson could not use the Civil
War-era law to charge racial harrasment. The appeals court said the
law is designed only to ban racial discrimination in hiring, firing
and promotion.
   Ms. Patterson still could charge racial harassment under a 1964
civil rights law. But the more recent statute provides that those
who win their cases in court only may collect back pay, not
potentially heavy damages awarded as compensation for emotional and
mental suffering.
   Civil rights groups say the more limited 1964 law may not be a
sufficient deterrent to harassment.
   Ms. Patterson, who worked as a teller and file coordinator at
McLean Credit Union for 10 years until she was laid off in 1982,
charged her boss repeatedly harassed her because she is black.
   Today's high court action greatly expands the potential
significance of the case.
   The court said it will use the case to reconsider a 1976 ruling,
called Runyon vs. McCrary, that said racially segregated private
schools which refuse to admit black students violate the Civil
Rights Act of 1866. The law was enacted in the aftermath of the
Civil War to ensure that recently freed slaves would enjoy all the
rights of citizenship.
   The 1976 ruling has given civil rights groups an important legal
weapon to fight discrimination by allowing the law to be used as a
basis for suits against private individuals.
   In a separate dissenting opinion today, Blackmun said, ``I am at
a loss to understand the motiviation of five members of this court
to reconsider an interpretation of a civil rights statute that so
clearly relfects our society's earnest commitment to ending racial
discrimination and in which Congress so evidently has acquiesced.''
   In other action, the court:
   _ Let stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone dial-up message
services in Arizona.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the ban violates free-speech rights. It was the first dial-a-porn
case with which the court was confronted.
   _ Agreed to consider giving federal prison wardens more power to
decide what publications inmates may read.
   The court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority
of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars.
   _ Turned away an appeal by former Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
in a lawsuit alleging he was cheated out of more than $2 million
for arranging a deal between a defense contractor and the Argentine
government.
   The justices, without comment, refused to order the setting
aside of more than $340,000 in a special fund Agnew and another
businessman would receive if they win the lawsuit.
   _ Let stand a ruling that property owners' rights are not
violated when they are required to remove structures that could
interfere with low-flying planes.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' rejected an appeal by a Cheyenne, Wyo., man fined $200
a day for refusing to trim a 48-foot cottonwood tree on his
property.

   Only a handful of people left their
homes and jobs today when local officials conducted their first
evacuation drill in this ``Chemical Valley'' community, the site of
the nation's only methyl isocyanate plant.
   Sirens sounded to signal the evacuation at about 9:25 a.m. and
brought little immediate response. About one hour later, only some
30 people had arrived at an emergency shelter set up in nearby
South Charleston.
   Volunteers participating in the drill, which was designed to
simulate a leak in a railroad tanker at the plant, said they
believed the operation was going well. But at least one resident
said ``mayhem'' would result if a real emergency occurred.
   Institute is the site of a Rhone-Poulenc chemical plant that
formerly was owned by Union Carbide Corp. The plant produces methyl
isocyanate, the chemical that leaked from a Union Carbide plant in
Bhopal, India, in 1984, killing more than 2,000 people.
   Less than a year later, a leak of another chemical at the
Institute plant sent 135 people to the hospital, prompting the call
by some community leaders for an organized evacuation plan in case
of a major leak.
   Barbara Oden, assistant vice president of academic affairs at
West Virginia State College, next to the plant, was in Institute
during the 1985 leak and said today's drill was ``useful'' even if
people didn't participate.
   ``We really didn't know what to do (then). At least now we have
some idea,'' she said. ``People normally don't take things
seriously. They don't think it can really happen.''
   Local officials responded to the problem of evacuating the town
of 1,500 by building a one-lane emergency road out of town to help
residents flee, but the gate to that road is kept locked except
when needed. Today was the first time it was used.
   ``I can envision cars all over the track. It's just a little
trail. It would be mayhem. It will be a mess,'' said Barbara Clark,
a health and physical education instructor at the state college.
   Today's evacuation was conducted under special circumstances.
West Virginia State called off classes this morning, so there were
no students to evacuate from academic buildings. The town also was
evacuated in stages so the roads leading out of town wouldn't be
too crowded.
   ``When this was prepared, people didn't take it seriously,''
said Lois Thurston, a custodian at West Virginia State College.
``I'm sure if the students were here, they wouldn't know what was
going on.''

<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case barred
defendants today from presenting witnesses at a pre-trial hearing
on whether the prosecution relied on testimony given Congress under
a grant of immunity.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell took the action, and gave
Oliver L. North and two of his co-defendants a tongue-lashing,
because they disobeyed his order establishing procedures for the
hearing.
   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh was allowed to testify,
and he told the court of an elaborate procedure he established so
that his entire staff would avoid exposure to the immunized
testimony, especially from news reports.
   Walsh is unable to use immunized congressional testimony by the
defendants to prosecute them, unless perjury is committed.
   Testifying with immunity during the Iran-Contra hearings were
North, a former National Security Council staff member;his one-time
boss, former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter; and
businessman Albert Hakim. The fourth defendant, retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, testified without immunity.
   Gesell said the three immunized defendants ``ignored'' his order
that they present a single grand jury witness who might testify
that his grand jury testimony was influenced by the immunized
congressional testimony.
   Instead, lawyers for the three immunized defendants sought to
present three witnesses, and issued subpoenas for Walsh and eight
members of his staff to testify at the hearing. Gesell, who had
ordered that only Walsh need testify, canceled the subpoenas last
week.
   ``Since the defendants did not comply, they won't be allowed to
present witnesses,'' he said today when the hearing began.
   ``It's not unusual that defendants make decisions that they are
not going to cooperate with the court. That's their right. We will
proceed whether we have confrontation and name-calling or not.''
   During the hearing, special independent counsel Herbert J.
Stern, who is handling the immunity question, introduced into
evidence memos written or ordered by Walsh, which instructed his
staff to avoid exposure to the immunized testimony and to other
information on the defendants.
   The memos also included instructions to grand jury witnesses and
grand jurors to avoid such exposure, especially through news
articles or broadcasts.
   The defendants in the case are charged with conspiring to use a
lawful presidential order permitting the sale of arms to Iran as a
springboard to illegal actions, including supplying assistance to
the Nicaraguan Contras when such aid was banned.

   More than 75 cars and several trucks have been
seized as part of ``Zero Tolerance,'' a crackdown by U.S. Customs
agents on people bringing even the tiniest amount of drugs into the
United States from Canada.
   Those caught with drugs also face federal charges and stiff
Customs fines.
   ``We believe we are beginning to get people's attention,'' said
U.S. Customs Service agent Lawrence LaDage.
   He said a lot of people ``are wondering if that (marijuana)
joint was really worth this kind of aggravation and loss.''
   Most of the vehicles will be auctioned off after administrative
hearings. A few will be returned to their owners, he said.
   Ken Parker, assistant U.S. attorney in Seattle, said he expects
to file charges later this week in a substantial number of cases.
   Until recently, people caught at the border with what is called
``user'' amounts of drugs usually paid an administrative fine to
the Customs Service and were released.
   But under the new program, which started March 21, anyone caught
at a border crossing with drugs faces possible arrest on federal
charges, regardless of the quantity. Any vehicle found to contain
drugs is seized, as is a vehicle carrying a driver or passenger
with drugs.
   On-the-spot fines range from several hundred dollars to more
than $1,000, and those caught also must agree to appear in federal
court.
   Americans' passports are seized and foreigners found guilty in
federal court aren't allowed back into the United States.
   In one case, LaDage said, a woman returning from a trip to
Canada with her boyfriend was shocked when her boyfriend was found
to be carrying a small amount of drugs and authorities impounded
her car.
   ``She and her boyfriend arrived together at the border,'' he
said. ``But I was told they left separately.
   ``And on foot.''

<HEAD>Jury Picked To Hear Second Retrial in Farm Family Slayings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury was chosen today for the retrial of a
man charged in the killings of six members of a farm family in
1973, and a defense attorney then asked that his client be fitted
for dentures to improve his image.
   It took three weeks to pick 12 jurors and four alternates for
the retrial of Wayne Carl Coleman. After selection was complete,
Judge Hugh Lawson heard arguments on defense motions.
   Coleman, Carl Isaacs and George Dungee were originally convicted
and sentenced to death in 1974 for the slayings of six members of
the Ned Alday family on their farm in southwest Georgia's Seminole
County.
   The convictions were overturned in 1985 by the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which said fair trials were impossible because of
extensive publicity about the case.
   The appeals court ordered new trials held elsewhere in Georgia.
Coleman is the second of the three to be retried; his case is being
heard in DeKalb County Superior Court, near Atlanta.
   Isaacs was convicted in Houston County earlier this year and was
again sentenced to death.
   After jury selection was completed, Lawson heard arguments on a
defense request for a continuance to allow Coleman to be fitted for
dentures.
   ``We think he will present a less favorable image to this jury''
without the dentures, said Coleman's attorney, Thomas M. West.
   The judge said he would defer ruling on that motion and one for
a change of venue until the close of business today. The change of
venue motion asks that the trial be moved to another location,
citing extensive publicity in Atlanta.
   Another motion seeking Billy Isaacs, Carl Isaacs' younger
brother, as a defense witness was denied. Lawson said that since
the younger Isaacs is to be a witness for the prosecution, defense
attorneys will have chance to cross-examine him.
   Billy Isaacs, who was 15 when he witnessed the slayings, turned
state's evidence and testified at the original trials. He is
serving a 40-year prison sentence.
   Coleman, Carl Isaacs and George Dungee were escapees from a
Maryland prison when they were arrested.
   Alday, his brother and three sons were shot one by one on May
14, 1973, when they arrived at the home of one of the sons, where
Coleman and his companions were interrupted in a burglary,
according to testimony.
   The wife of one of Alday's sons was taken to a woods six miles
away, where she was raped and killed.

   A mine left over from World War II exploded

   The state-run Middle East News Agency said the blast occurred in
the province of Marsa Matrouh, but it did not say when or provide
other details.
   Marsa Matrouh, about 300 miles northwest of Cairo, was a center
of North African fighting between Allied and Axis forces in 1942-43.
   Some of Egypt's western desert has been cleared of explosives,
but hundreds of thousands of mines remain buried, according to
Egyptian military experts. Three years ago, authorities discovered
and detonated 300 live World War II mines stored near a school in
the province.

   The Buddhist tribe, known as Chakmas, has been campaigning for

   At least 3,000 people have died in attacks, counterattacks and
police actions in the area since 1977. About 50,000 Chakmas have
fled to the adjoining Indian state of Tripura in recent years to
escape the fighting.

<HEAD>Family Planning Cuts Chinese Births by 200 Million, Report Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government-backed family planning has cut
Chinese births by about 200 million in recent years, but baby
boomers are leading another population surge, according to an
official report quoted Monday.
   China's family planning policy, which limits the number of
children per couple and promotes late childbearing, has cut the
births since the 1970s, the domestic China News Service said in a
report appearing in Hong Kong newspapers.
   China, the world's most populous nation, has more than 1 billion
people. Officials have estimated it must keep the birth rate below
1.5 percent to reach its planned population limit of 1.2 billion at
the turn of the century.
   But the birth rate was 2 percent in each of the last two years.
A primary reason for the increase, expected to last until at least
1995, is that people born in the baby boom years of 1962-75 are
reaching maturity and having their own babies, the reports said.

   Eight youngsters digging around the
foundation of their clubhouse unearthed two glass jars filled with
gold coins and jewelry worth about $215,000, police said Monday.
   The treasure, buried 16 inches below the surface, included
modern gold coins issued by South Africa, Canada and Austria, as
well as gold bracelets, necklaces and rings.
   The children, aged 9-11, dug them up on a deserted plot of land
in the central Dutch town of Bennekom, according to police
spokesman Theo Reus. They found the jars Thursday while digging a
hole to reinforce their clubhouse's foundation.
   One of their parents notified police, Reus said.
   ``We're investigating whether it (the treasure) is the proceeds
of a crime or whether it was buried legally,'' Reus said. ``We
brought in a bulldozer to do some digging of our own but found
nothing.''
   He said seven people already had laimed ownership of the
treasure.
   According to Dutch law, authorities have 30 years to find the
legal owners. If none is found, the gold and jewels will become the
property of the finders.

   West Berlin Justice Minister Rupert
Scholz will be named West Germany's defense minister, replacing
NATO Secretary-General designate Manfred Woerner, government
sources said Monday.
   The sources said Chancellor Helmut Kohl will name Scholz as the
new defense minister during a news conference on Tuesday.
   Chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost declined to comment on
reports naming Scholz as the new minister on Monday, but confirmed
Kohl would name Woerner's replacement on Tuesday.
   Scholz, 50, is to move into the post May 20, according to the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A lawyer, Scholz is West Berlin's senator for justice and
federal affairs, and a delegate to the federal parliament in Bonn.
   He is considered a staunch backer of NATO and West Germany's
membership in the alliance and strong supporter of close ties with
the United States. He is also a ranking member of Kohl's ruling
Christian Democratic party.
   Woerner, the outgoing defense minister, will take over NATO's
top job July 1, the first West German to hold the post. He has
served as West Germany's foreign minister since October 1982.

   Acid rain could be almost as big a contributor
as fertilizer runoff or sewage and industrial water pollution to
the decline of marine life in East Coast estuaries, an
environmental group concluded today.
   A study by the Environmental Defense Fund said nitrate compounds
from the atmosphere _ originating mostly as nitric acid _
contribute 25 percent of the total nitrogen input to Cheasapeake
Bay, compared with 34 percent from fertilizers and 23 percent from
municipal sewage and industrial discharges.
   Nitrates act as fertilizers, encouraging ``blooms'' of algae
that use up oxygen dissolved in the water and making it difficult
for other plants and fish to live.
   These airborne compounds also are contributing to problems in
Delaware Bay, Albemarle-Pamlico Sound in North Carolina, Long
Island Sound between New York and Connecticut and the New York
Bight in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey, the
group's scientists said.
   ``The problem of enhanced primary productivity from atmospheric
nitrogen inputs appears to be widespread along the Atlantic
Seaboard,'' the fund's report said.
   Release of the report kicked off three days of rallies, press
conferences and other events by environmental groups timed to
coincide with this week's visit to Washington by Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Canada, supported by U.S. environmentalists, for years has been
unsuccessfully pressing the United States to act against the
pollution precursors that form acid rain and flow northward across
the border before falling on Canada.
   The most-often-mentioned precursor is sulfur dioxide, which
turns into sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide is
mostly emitted by coal-burning power plants, but an estimated
one-third of the rainfall acidity in the eastern United States
actually comes from oxides of nitrogen, which become nitric acid in
the atmosphere.
   Nationwide, about one-third of nitrigen oxides originate in
power plant emissions, one-third in motor vehicle exhaust and
one-seventh in industrial emnissions.
   Today's report was the first to estimate the input to Chesapeake
Bay of nitrates originating in the atmosphere not only as direct
rain and other deposition on the bay itself _ an estimated 9,150
tons per year _ but also in runoff from the land of the bay's
watershed _ 29,400 tons per year. The fund estimated that 154,000
tons of nitrogen compounds from all sources wind up in the bay.
   The total of 154,000 tons was in the range of estimates given by
the joint federal-state Chesapeake Bay pollution control program,
92,000 tons to 198,000 tons.
   The fund called on the joint program to adopt measures aimed at
reducing atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds to the bay
and its watershed by 40 percent. The program already has adopted a
goal of reducing nitrogen and phosphorous discharges to the bay by
40 percent.
   At the Environmental Protection Agency, spokesman Chris Rice
said no agency expert had had a chance to study the fund's report
and the EPA therefore was not in a position to comment.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., announced his bid for a
second term today, while veteran Democratic Rep. Butler Derrick of
South Carolina said he'll seek an eighth term in November.
   In prepared remarks to announce his candidacy, Lautenberg did
not mention Republican senatorial candidate Pete Dawkins, a West
Point hero who recently moved to New Jersey and announced Feb. 29
he would seek Lautenberg's seat.
   Lautenberg told reporters at Liberty State Park in Jersey City,
N.J., that he expects to debate Dawkins during the campaign.
   But he said he would not attack the GOP candidate, and that it
would be up to voters to decide if Dawkins should answer for moving
into the state to run to office.
   Lautenberg also said he must work on getting New Jersey voters
to better recognize his name.
   ``I think it's fair to say people know my work better than they
know me. I guess I haven't been as good a communicator as I've been
a worker,'' he said.
   Lautenberg, 63, has run for office just once. The Montclair
multimillionaire, who made his fortune with the Automatic Data
Processing Corp., upset well-known Rep. Millicent Fenwick to gain
the six-year Senate term. Fenwick has since retired from Congress.
   Lautenberg is opposed in the June 7 primary by political
unknowns Elnardo J. Webster of Jersey City and Harold J. Young of
Rahway.
   In Columbia, S.C., Derrick said he will run again for his 3rd
District seat.
   ``It has been an honor to carry the 3rd District's values to
Washington for 14 years and it would be a privilege to do so for
two more,'' he said at the state Democratic Party headquarters.
   Derrick, who is second-ranking member of the House Rules
Committee and a ranking member of the Budget Committee, is being
challenged by Anderson surgeon Henry Jordon, who lost to Democrat
Ernest Hollings in the 1986 U.S. Senate race.
   Derrick, 51, said he has a substantial lead in the race at this
point but said Jordon represents one of his three toughest
challenges. The others were the 1974 and 1980 races against
Marshall Parker. Derrick said he expects to spend more money on
this campaign than any other.
   Jordon, a leader in the Carolina Conservative Coalition, is
expected to portray Derrick as more liberal than the people he
represents.

<HEAD>British Airways To Begin First of Smoking Ban Trials Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways will ban smoking on one of its
busiest domestic routes for a month beginning Tuesday in the first
of a series of smoke-free flights.
   The airline will forbid an estimated 2,500 passengers from
lighting up on its 12 daily one-hour shuttle flights between
London's Heathrow airport and Glasgow, Scotland.
   On June 6, some British Airways flights to the continent will
become smoke-free for a month, and in November some Los Angeles and
New York-bound flights join the experiment.
   Several small British carriers have banned smoking on domestic
and international flights, but British Airways is the largest to
try it. The company's only domestic competitor, British Midland
Airways, said it had no plans to ban smoking.
   Unlike the United States, where the government forced airlines
to ban smoking on all domestic flights shorter than two hours,
Britain has no national laws concerning smoking. About 34 percent
of British adults smoke cigarettes.
   British Airways officials said they took action because research
showed that if smoking were banned, the number of customers who
would fly more often was four times the number who would switch
airlines.
   ``In recent years demand for non-smoking areas on our aircraft
have grown and grown. Today on most routes smokers are very much in
the minority,'' said Jim Harris, marketing director for the
airline. ``We have steadily increased non-smoking areas to reflect
this trend. ... Now we want a full trial of customer reaction to
see if we can extend the idea still further.''
   Airline spokesman Michael Blunt said the carrier will decide
whether to continue the bans after studying surveys and other
passenger response.
   Stephen Eyres, director of a pro-smoking group, criticized the
idea as discriminatory, dangerous and unnecessary.
   ``Our view is that so long as non-smokers' wishes are respected
with definite no-smoking areas, there also ought to be areas where
smokers can light up and not be treated like social lepers,'' he
said.
   He said the bans would lead to safety risks from people smoking
in toilets, and said that it was unnecessary because cabin air is
changed every three minutes.
   Opposition lawmaker George Foulkes said Monday he would
introduce a bill in Parliament Tuesday to ban smoking in the
workplace, saying ``some people regard it as torture to have to
work in a smoke-filled workplace.''
   But opposition legislation rarely passes the legislative body,
and a government spokesman said that government planned no national
laws banning smoking on airlines or in public places.
   ``It's like drinking, it's a question of choice. It's a part of
society's freedoms,'' said Paul Hayward of the Department of Health
and Social Services. ``At this moment this government has no
intention to inhibit this generally accepted freedom.''

<TEXT>
   An explosion and fire struck the submarine
USS Bonefish off Florida, forcing the crew to abandon ship, the
Navy said. Three of the 92-member crew were missing today and 23
were injured.
   Crews from two frigates and a helicopter searched the Atlantic
for the missing men after Sunday afternoon's fire, ``looking and
listening for any kind of sound or indication'' of the men, said
Lt. Cmdr. Bill Sonntag of the Norfolk-based Atlantic Fleet.
   ``We're doing everything we can to find them out there,'' he
said.
   The submarine was afloat alongside the frigate USS McCloy,
officials said.
   ``No one has been back on board to assess the damage,'' Chief
Petty Officer Terry Borton said today from Atlantic Fleet
headquarters here. ``At this time, there is no smoke coming from
the vessel.''
   The Bonefish, one of the Navy's last diesel-electric submarines,
surfaced Sunday afternoon 160 miles east of Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
said Cmdr. Fred Leeder, a fleet spokesman.
   The fire was believed caused by an explosion in the 30-year-old
submarine's battery compartment, Sonntag said. Because of fire and
toxic fumes, the commanding officer ordered the vessel evacuated,
he said.
   Of the missing, ``We don't know whether they are still aboard
the submarine or whether they were in the water,'' said Capt. Brent
Baker, another fleet spokesman.
   The injured were transfered to the aircraft carrier John F.
Kennedy and taken to the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla.,
according Borton.
   The extent of the injuries were unknown, but ``some of them had
smoke inhalation,'' Baker said.
   A spokesman for the hospital, Nick Young, said that of the 23
injured, 20 were ambulatory, but he had no further information.
   The remainder of the Bonefish's crewmen were taken aboard the
frigate USS Carr and taken to Mayport, Fla., for a flight back to
the Bonefish's home port of Charleston, S.C.
   The solemn-faced crewmen refused requests from reporters to
answer questions about the fire when they arrived in Mayport. Most
were wearing blue coveralls and sneakers, but many were shoeless. A
few carried small plastic bags, apparently holding a few of their
belongings.
   They were taken to a waiting cargo plane.
   Chaplain Bill Perry went aboard the Carr and visited the men.
   He said the general mood was ``overwhelming fatigue,'' adding
that most had been up all night and many had been on watch the
night before.
   ``They've been through a real trauma,'' he said.
   Leeder said the Carr would attempt to tow the submarine either
to Port Canaveral, Fla., or Charleston. There apparently was no
serious problem in keeping it afloat late Sunday, Leeder said.
   The submarine rescue ship USS Petrel from Charleston is on its
way and will determine whether the fire is out, the Navy said. The
Petrel is expected to arrive early this afternoon.
   ``People from the Petrel will be boarding the sub to make any
kind of damage assessment,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Patricia McMillan, also
a Norfolk spokesman, adding that afterward, a decision would be
made on where to tow the sub.
   Leeder said it would take considerable time to tow the Bonefish
into port. It can make about 3 mph under tow, a senior naval
officer said.
   The Bonefish had been taking part in routine exercises for about
a week with the Carr and the JFK in what is called the Jacksonville
Operations area, authorities said.
   The sub was commissioned in 1959 and is used primarily for
training, Leeder said.
   The 2,895-ton, 219-foot submarine was built by New York
Shipbuilding in Camden, N.J., and launched in 1958. It normally
carries a crew of 82. It is capable of traveling about 15 knots on
the surface and about 21 knots submerged, according to Jane's
Fighting Ships.
   It is powered by three 1,500-horsepower diesel engines that
drive a single propeller while traveling on the surface. Once
submerged, it is driven by two electric motors.
   The Bonefish, like its sister vessels the Barbel and Blueback,
is capable of carrying torpedoes, but no missiles.
   They were the last diesel-electric combat submarines to be
constructed for the Navy and were expected to be decomissioned in
the '80s.
   Navy officials use the diesel-powered subs to simulate Soviet
submarines because the Soviet Union still operates approximately
100 diesel-electric vessels. In all, the United States operates
four diesel-electric boats.

   Education Secretary William J. Bennett's
report that American education is doing better but not well enough
met today with a failing grade from one teachers' union for
absolving the federal government ``from any responsibility for
improving public education.''
   Teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress in the
five years since a similar study became a biting critique of U.S.
education called ``A Nation At Risk,'' said Mary Hatwood Futrell,
president of the National Education Association.
   Another teachers' union called the Bennett report ``a mixed
bag.''
   His report, a follow-up requested by President Reagan for the
fifth anniversary of ``A Nation At Risk,'' said that American
schools ``have begun the long climb back'' but that the nation is
still at risk from an academic system rife with mediocrity and
resistant to change.
   Bennett says American teen-agers are taking more math, science
and advanced placement courses, and scoring somewhat higher on
college-entrance and other tests.
   But ``curricular foolishness has not been eliminated from
American high schools,'' he said, and the schools ``are still much
too cavalier about homework.''
   In his evaluation of the impact of school reform, called
``American Education: Making It Work,'' Bennett said:
   ``American education has made some undeniable progress in the
last few years. The precipitous downward slide of previous decades
has been arrested, and we have begun the long climb back to
reasonable standards. ...
   ``We are doing better than we were in 1983. But we are certainly
not doing well enough. ... We are still at risk.''
   Bennett will deliver his report to Reagan in a White House
ceremony Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the provocative report
by the National Commission on Excellence in Education that warned
of ``a rising tide of mediocrity'' in U.S. schools.
   The National Education Association, which is frequently at odds
with Bennett, planned to mark the anniversary Tuesday with a
protest in Lafayette Park across from the White House.
   ``I give the report a failing grade,'' said Ms. Futrell, the NEA
president. ``It absolves the federal government from any
responsibility for improving public education. On the plus side,
teachers deserve the credit for the academic progress the students
have made since 1983.
   ``Had it not been for the efforts of Congress, which held back
the tide of budget cuts proposed by the Reagan Administration,''
she said, ``schools would have been in much worse shape, which
gives Congress an A.''
   ``Its a mixed bag,'' said Jane Usdan, spokeswoman for the
American Federation of Teachers. ``He highlights what happened over
the last five years, that there's been a lot of good, including
increases in teachers' salaries and standards that have been
tightened.''
   But, she said, there's a lot that needs still to be done and
``the question is whether these kinds of reforms are going to do
the job that's needed.''
   Bennett said too many students drop out, ``and too many of those
who do graduate have been poorly educated. Our students know too
little, and their command of essential skills is too slight.
   ``Good schools for disadvantaged and minority children are much
too rare. ... An ethos of success is missing from too many American
schools,'' he said. ``Our teachers and principals are too often
hired and promoted in ways that make excellence a matter of chance,
not design.''
   Bennett called anew for merit pay for teachers; wider choice in
public education for parents; stronger curricula at all levels, and
stricter accountability for educators, including freedom for local
schools to hire the best and fire the worst teachers and principals.
   He said a forthcoming National Assessment of Educational
Progress report indicates 9- and 17-year-olds improved their
performance in math between 1982 and 1986, while 13-year-olds held
steady.
   Another National Assessment will show that in those same years,
``17-year-old science students made up nearly all the ground lost
since the 1977 assessment,'' he said.
   A new federal study indicated that 12.7 percent of last year's
high school seniors completed all the courses recommended in ``A
Nation At Risk:'' four years of English; three years each of math,
science and social studies; a half-year of computer science and,
for the college-bound, two years of foreign language.
   By comparison, fewer than 2 percent of graduates in the Class of
1982 took such a regimen. Researchers reviewed the transcripts of
15,000 graduates from each year.
   The same study indicated fewer students are drifting into less
rigorous ``general tracks'' in high school. Only 17 percent were on
a ``general track'' in 1987, down from 35 percent in 1982.
   But American students still are humbled by international
comparisons, including a recent science assessment that found
American 10-year-olds were average, ``but our 14-year-olds are far
behind their peers around the world, placing 14th out of 17
countries,'' Bennett said.
   He took a slap at what he called the Chicken Littles who believe
that ``some children can't learn because their color, class or
family background gets in th way.''
   Bennett said minorities already comprise 28 percent of America's
school-age population. ``Apocalyptic analyses and Chicken Little
stories about an onrushing wave of `unteachable' students should be
rejected,'' he said.
   ``Above all, sound education reforms are threatened by the
determined opposition they elicit,'' Bennett said, pointing to
``what might be called opposition by extortion, the false claim
that to fix our schools will first require a fortune in new
funding.''
   Bennett's predecessor, T.H. Bell, who commissioned ``A Nation At
Risk,'' has accused the president of failing to provide strong
leadership for school reform.
   Bell and such groups as the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching and the Committee for Economic Development
have warned in recent months that school reform is not working in
America's largely minority inner-city school systems.
   Bennett, however, said ``achievement can be torpedoed by the
idea that it is mostly a matter of luck, wealth or native ability _
an idea altogether too prevalent in American education today.''
   Bennett said average teacher salaries, after inflation, have
risen from $23,451 in 1982-83 to an estimated $28,300 today, nearly
a 21 percent rise, and more college students are expressing
interest in the profession. But ``until good teachers are paid more
than bad ones, our efforts to improve teaching and learning will be
frustrated.''
   He complained that there are more penalties ``for serving up a
single rotten hamburger in a restaurant than for repeatedly
furnishing a thousand children with a rotten education.''
   ``We urgently need to improve our methods for locating able and
talented teachers and administrators, for encouraging and promoting
them, and for penalizing those who consistently fail to do their
job,'' he said.
   ``Accountability is the linchpin of education reform.''

   Sailors who abandoned ship
when the submarine USS Bonefish caught fire arrived here today
aboard a Navy frigate for a flight back to their home port of
Charleston, S.C.
   The 66 uninjured crewmen were solemn faced and refused to answer
reporters' questions about Sunday's fire aboard the submarine. They
were taken to a waiting cargo plane.
   Twenty-three members of the 92-person crew were injured,
according to the Navy, and three were listed as missing.
   The injured men, three in serious condition, were taken aboard
the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy, the Navy said.
Helicopters from the carrier landed this morning at the
Jacksonville Naval Air Station with the injured, who were then
taken to Jacksonville Naval Hospital, said Stuart Johnson, a
hospital spokesman.
   Another hospital spokesman, Nick Young, said that 20 of the
injured were ambulatory, but he had no further information.
   Most of the sailors departing the fast frigate USS Carr in
Mayport were wearing blue coveralls and sneakers, but some were
shoeless. A few carried small plastic bags, apparently holding a
few of their belongings.
   Five families drove overnight from Charleston to greet relatives
at dockside. The families were allowed to go aboard the Carr for
private greetings.
   Lee and Alice Causey of Jacksonville were on hand to greet the
ship and their son, 30-year-old Petty Officer 1st Class Avery L.
Causey.
   ``He didn't say much. He was just glad to be back,'' Lee Causey
said. ``It's good to see him. I was on a submarine for 21 years, so
I know what he's going through.''
   Mrs. Causey said she first heard about the fire early this
morning, when her daughter-in-law called from Charleston.
   ``I was very scared and praying,'' Mrs. Causey said.
   Wesley Causey said all his brother asked for was a pair of shoes.
   Chaplain Bill Perry went aboard the Carr and visited the crewmen.
   He said the general mood was ``overwhelming fatigue,'' adding
that most had been up all night and many had been on watch the
night before.
   ``They've been through a real trauma,'' Perry said.
   He said he told the men that relatives and fellow servicemen in
Jacksonville and Charleston had been praying for their safety.
   Most of the sailors spent the night in the mess hall of the
Carr, talking with each other about the experience.

   Sales of existing homes, spurred by lower
mortgage rates, edged up 2.5 percent in March for the second month
in a row, a real estate trade group said Monday.
   The National Association of Realtors said existing single-family
homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.33 million units
last month.
   Despite the March rise, which followed an identical 2.5 percent
increase in February, the rate of sales remained 9.8 percent below
March 1987. The sales pace had dipped in November, December and
January.
   ``Housing activity has recovered from the low levels of (the
winter), but even so we can expect to see fewer sales ... in 1988
than in 1987,'' said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions.
   John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist, attributed the
sales increase to lower interest rates.
   ``We expect the recovery to continue with April's (sales)
figures, likely to be up also,'' he said.
   A year ago, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages bottomed out at just
above 9 percent. They rose in spurts, topping 11.5 percent in early
October. Rates eased after the stock market crash, dipping just
below 10 percent in February and March before rising again to 10.3
percent last week.
   Obrinsky said interest rates were likely to rise slowly and
steadily this year, but he said that would disrupt sales less than
the sharp jumps taken by interest rates in 1987.
   ``I think on balance we could see sales still hold up for some
months down the road before the impact of the higher mortgage rates
begins to take its toll,'' he said.
   The March sales increase was accompanied by a 4.1 percent rise
in prices to a national median, or midpoint, of $88,700, up from
$88,100 in February. Tuccillo predicted only modest increases for
the rest of the year.
   By region, the median resale price was $143,100 in the
Northeast, compared with $128,900 a year ago; $117,100 in the West,
compared with $105,900; $84,000 in the South, compared with
$81,200, and $67,800 in the Midwest, down from $68,300.
   Sales were led by a 9.6 percent advance in the West to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 570,000 units and a 6.7 percent
boost to 1.27 million units in the South. Sales were unchanged in
the Northeast at 660,000 units and down 3.4 percent in the Midwest
to 860,000 units.

<HEAD>Jackson Says He'd Negotiate on Hostages; Dukakis Says `No
Concessions'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Jackson comment on negotiating with terrorists,
subbing 2 grafs for 6th graf pvs, Jackson said; cuts last 2 grafs</NOTE>

   Democrat Michael Dukakis said today he would
talk with terrorists holding hostages but ``never make
concessions,'' commenting one day after campaign rival Jesse
Jackson criticized what he said was Dukakis' view that ``we should
not negotiate with terrorists.''
   Jackson set off the exchange Sunday when he said, ``I've raised
the point in several debates this year. Every time a question comes
up about terrorism, Mr. Dukakis says, `I'm against terrorism. ...
We should not negotiate with terrorists. ... In the Middle East,
never negotiate with terrorists.'
   ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd do
it.''
   Dukakis, in Pennsylvania, told reporters today after being asked
about Jackson's statement, ``I think we need a tough anti-terrorist
policy. ...
   ``I don't have a problem with talking, but you never make
concessions to terrorists _ ever. If you do, what you end up with
is hostage-taking and terrorism all over the world.''
   Jackson, asked today about negotiating with terrorists, said he
would not make ``material concessions'' to them but could conceive
of situations in which he would grant hostage-takers safe passage.
   ``I would never exchange arms for hostages,'' he said, a
reference to the Iran-Contra operations steered by Reagan
administration officials.
   U.S. policy holds that American officials ``will talk to any
official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we
will not make concessions,'' a State Department spokesman said
today.
   The gentle battling between the surviving Democratic candidates
got more direct as the candidates closed in on Tuesday's
delegate-rich Pennsylvania primary.
   A new poll, sponsored by Philadelphia's KYW-TV and Pittsburgh's
KDKA-TV, showed Dukakis apparently increasing his lead among likely
Pennsylvania Democratic voters. In the new poll, taken by telephone
over the weekend, Dukakis led Jackson 57 percent to 31 percent with
12 percent still undecided.
   Last week, with Sen. Albert Gore Jr. still being counted,
Dukakis led Jackson 45 percent to 34 percent, with 14 percent
undecided and 7 percent for Gore. The polls, with a margin of error
of five percentage points either way, were conducted by KRC
Research of Cambridge, Mass.
   It was Jackson who has stirred the biggest controversy in recent
days with his call on Sunday for negotiation with anyone to free
hostages.
   ``In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set up
preconditions that stop effectiveness,'' Jackson said at a rally in
Washington. ``I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get the
hostages out of Beirut.''
   Eight Americans are currently held hostage by Moslem extremists
in Beirut.
   On Sunday, Dukakis did a whistle-stop tour of Pennsylvania, but
he was switching to the air today, hitting six cities to make an
impression in every media market in the state before the voters go
to the polls Tuesday.
   Jackson raised money in Washington before returning late Sunday
for a final push in the Keystone State.
   Dukakis has a big lead in the polls in Pennsylvania, where 178
delegates are at stake. The complicated process _ with delegates
elected individually _ offers a challenge to voters who may have to
pull the lever up to 12 times. But it also offers Dukakis, if he
does well, a chance to win as many as 100 more delegates than
Jackson.
   ``You've got to vote more than once. This is the one time you
can do so legally,'' he told students at Penn State University in
State College. ``Vote early and often _ vote for me and vote for my
delegates.''
   Dukakis is more than half the way to a delegate majority,
holding 1,075.15 national convention votes. Jackson has 836.1 while
599.75 were uncommitted. A tally of 2,081 or more is needed to win
the nomination at the July convention in Atlanta.
   Guam's three convention votes entered the uncommitted column
Sunday evening following caucuses on the Pacific island.
   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush is virtually
unchallenged on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, when he may win enough of
the 78 delegates at stake to go over the magic majority mark _
1,139 _ needed to win the GOP nomination in New Orleans in August.
   A new poll by Time magazine indicates that a Dukakis-Jackson
ticket would get 47 percent of the vote nationwide to 42 percent
for a Republican ticket headed by Bush.
   A Dukakis-Gore ticket would defeat Bush 49 percent to 39
percent, but Bush would defeat Jackson by 52 percent to 34 percent,
according to the poll released Sunday.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis and Jackson have been unusually
cordial recently, but the best-friends atmosphere thinned when
Jackson urged Dukakis to release a proposed budget.
   ``I'm not just for Head Start, I'm willing to pay for Head
Start,'' Jackson said during the debate Saturday night in
Pittsburgh. ``I have put numbers together to pay for my dreams.''
   Dukakis strongly disagreed.
   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's
absurd,'' he told reporters Sunday on his chartered Amtrak train,
nicknamed the ``Pennsylvania Presidential Unlimited.''
   ``I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done that
in great detail,'' Dukakis said as he toured western Pennsylvania.

<HEAD>Mayors, Police Chiefs Hear Federal Drug Message</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Field commanders in the national war on drugs
heard a pair of federal battle plans on Monday, plans that found
different groups to blame for the growing problem, and different
solutions.
   A Democratic member of Congress charged that the Reagan
administration lacked an organized plan to battle drugs, and he
called for a drug summit meeting with the heads of Latin American
nations.
   A top aide to President Reagan, on the other hand, said it was
time to put more pressure on those who use drugs.
   In remarks to a meeting of the National Conference of Mayors,
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said it was not enough that the Drug
Enforcement Administration and other Justice Department agencies
were battling drugs. They should be getting help from the State
Department, the Education Department, the Defense Department and
the Department of Health and Human Services,
   ``It's not a question of whether we're losing the battle, it's a
question that we don't even know who's in charge of the war,''
Rangel told a session of mayors and police chiefs.
   But Gary L. Bauer, Reagan's assistant for policy development,
told the meeting that the nation does not appear to have reached
the collective state of mind neded to defeat the drug problem.
   Drugs pour into America because there is a market for them, he
said, and the battle needs to be waged against the users.
   Accomplices in crime are young couples who think it's all right
to use drugs casually on the weekend, abstainers who look away when
others use drugs, sports heroes who set a bad example by using
drugs, college presidents who know drugs are on campus but fail to
act, civil libertarians who tie up the courts with technicalities
and sophistry and television and movie producers who glorify drugs,
Bauer said.
   ``Unless we find the political will to penalize the users as
well as the dealers,'' the drug problem will remain, he said. The
nation cannot buy or blast its way drug free with financial
programs and the military, he said.
   Rangel, pressed by New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, said he
plans to introduce a measure to direct federal anti-drug funds
directly to large cities, rather than through federal and state
bureaucracies.
   In addition, Rangel called for increased participation of all
federal agencies in anti-drug battles.
   To begin with, he said, the State Department should call a
summit of nations from Latin America to find ways to cooperate in
the drug war. A plan must be developed to work with people.
   ``You can't take a farmer who is making $10,000 on coca leaves
and tell him to go back to his former crop that made $500,'' Rangel
said.
   In addition to involving the State Department, Rangel questioned
the reluctance of the Defense Department to join in patroling the
borders, asked for Education Department anti-drug programs and
suggested drug rehabilitation organized by the Health and Human
Services department.
   As to the suggestion that more and more drug users be arrested:
``Where do you put them?'' he said.

<HEAD>Top Sandinista Official in Miami For Contra Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Sandinista official was in Miami today for
talks with representatives of the Contra rebels as the two sides
prepared for a new round of peace negotiations in Nicaragua later
this week.
   Sandinista Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco was meeting
secretly with the Contra directors' secretary to discuss ``the
agenda and arrangements'' for talks to begin Thursday in Managua,
rebel leader Adolfo Calero said.
   Calero also said the Contras will demand the Sandinistas
immediately allow U.S. food and supplies to rebel troops as a
precondition for any further talks based on the agreement reached
last month in Sapoa, Nicaragua.
   ``If that is not done the whole Sapoa agreement will collapse,''
Calero said.
   An internal Contra memo written by Luis Fley, who goes by the
name Cmdr. Johnson, recently called the situation of the Contras
troops in the field ``critical.''
   Calero said the Sandinistas must immediately agree on what the
rebels call the ``modus operandi'' for getting the humanitarian aid
to the Contra forces inside Nicaragua.
   The plight of the troops has reportedly been a contributing
cause to a rift among the Contra leaders, but today Calero
downplayed the differences among the five directors.
   He denied leading a movement to fire top Contra Cmdr. Enrique
Bermudez, but acknowledged two other rebel field commanders, Walter
Calderon and Diogenes Hernadnez, had objected to the peace talks.
He also said three top civilian employees of the rebel troops had
been replaced by military officials.
   But he inisted there was still unity among the directors of the
Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally called.
   All five directors, including Aristides Sanchez, who skipped the
last meeting in Managua for ``personal reasons,'' will fly to
Nicaragua for this week's negotiations, Calero said.
   Calero refused to discuss where Tinoco was conducting the
pre-meeting talks with the directors' secretary in strongly
anti-communist Miami. But he said there were no plans for the
Sandinista foreign ministry official to talk with the directors
themselves here.
   Tinoco previously has accused the Contras of engaging in
political maneuvering to avoid a definitive cease-fire while they
receive U.S. aid.

   The Associated Press will speed up its
DataStream news delivery system to about 9,000 words a minute
beginning in June, add to its news staff, and introduce new photo
and graphics services, President Louis D. Boccardi announced Monday.
   He said these ventures into ``the new world of news'' will help
the news cooperative meet its responsibilities to its members, now
numbering a record 1,428.
   Boccardi told the AP annual meeting that 10 to 15 people will be
added to the domestic news staff during 1988.
   ``The bulk of these will go to our line bureaus, whose state and
regional news coverage is so important to you,'' he told publishers
and editors of newspapers that use the AP. ``With the membership
increasing as it has, the demands on our state bureaus are
increasing. And we must meet those needs.''
   AP Board Chairman William J. Keating said, ``Never in its
140-year history has the Associated Press faced greater challenges
or more exciting prospects than in 1988, with newspaper membership
at a record-high level.
   ``A strong, dedicated and talented staff and a commitment to
leadership in news technology will meet those challenges,'' Keating
said. ``At the same time we members must remember that our
cooperation and our help is essential to AP performance.''
   Boccardi said the AP is about to move from a speed of about
1,050 words a minute to about 9,000 on its DataStream and
DataFeature wires.
   ``We will begin in June installing at highspeed newspapers a new
generation of AP microprocessors that will enable us, state by
state, to leap to 9,600-baud delivery,'' he said.
   For newspapers with systems that need slower speeds, the
delivery rate can be reduced, but he said ``the news will fly on AP
circuits at 9600.'' That increase in capacity will avoid crowding
that can slow copy delivery just as a crowded highway can slow
traffic.
   ``We are raising the speed limit from 55 mph to 440 mph and ...
we're widening the AP interstate from four lanes to eight,''
Boccardi said.
   He said three successful test installations of the new AP
electronic darkroom for large newspapers are in place in St.
Petersburg, Fla., Chicago and Minneapolis. In June, Boccardi said,
the AP will unveil a PC-based electronic darkroom for smaller
newspapers.
   He also announced that the AP will be offering members a new
picture transmitter for the handling of their own photos _ a small,
portable system enabling a photographer to transmit photos from
color or black and white negatives without making prints.
   The AP already has put that system into use in covering such
events as the Winter Olympic Games and the NCAA basketball
championships in March. The transmitter, called the AP@Leafax 35,
was developed to AP specifications by Leaf Systems Inc. of Natick,
Mass. AP holds exclusive distribution rights.
   By the end of the year, Boccardi said, the AP will begin
operating a new service called DataFeature Graphics that will
deliver news graphics offered by syndicates and supplemental
services.
   He also said the AP has now converted worldwide to all-color
photography, a step taken in the United States more than a year ago.
   By next spring, he said, a new financial markets system will be
ready for AP members. ``You will be able to use our feed to create
stock tables in virtually any form you wish, emphasizing local
companies or industries, for example,'' he said.

<HEAD>Najib Offers To Withdraw Troops From Pakistani Border Areas</HEAD>

   President Najib on Monday offered to
withdraw Afghan troops from their posts near the Pakistani border
if anti-communist guerrillas and Pakistan agree to do the same.
   ``We are ready to create a non-military line'' between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Najib said at the opening of celebrations
marking the 10th anniversary of the Afghan revolution that
installed a Soviet-backed government.
   Najib told an assembly of three small parties loyal to his
government that such a withdrawal would allow the estimated 3
million Afghan refugees in Pakistan to return home.
   However, the proposal appeared to be little more than a
face-saving acknowledgement of the difficulties the Afghan army is
having against onslaughts by anti-communist guerrillas, based in
Pakistan and supplied with U.S. and Chinese weapons.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help quell an
uprising by a guerrilla front.
   The Soviet Union has agreed to start withdrawing its estimated
115,000 troops from Afghanistan on May 15 under a U.N.-mediated
agreement signed April 14 in Geneva by the United States, the
Soviet Union, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
   The United States, China and several other countries have been
aiding the Afghan guerrillas via Pakistan. The Soviet Union arms
the Afghan military forces. Each superpower has reserved the right
to continue its assistance as long as the other one does.
   The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the Geneva accord,
have vowed to continue fighting until Najib's government is
overthrown.
   On Sunday, Najib confirmed a guerrilla claim that the Afghan
army had been pushed out of Barikot, a key post on the Pakistani
frontier.
   Barikot, 150 miles northeast of Kabul, controls a major road
leading into Afghanistan from Pakistan. The guerrillas said the
victory opened a new, direct supply route for weapons into
Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas said Monday they have taken control of three
other strategic towns in recent weeks: Ghorband, 50 miles north of
Kabul, and Maarouf and Darwazgai, both in the south about 30 miles
from the Pakistani bordar.
   Western sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
guerrillas captured Ghorband in late March. There was no immediate
word on the other two claims.
   The guerrillas also said Najib's government is negotating with
Moslem guerillas for the release of a provincial governor captured
by insurgents earlier this month.
   The insurgents are holding the governor of northern Kunduz
province, the chief of police and two senior Afghan army officers.
The governor and the two other officials were not identified.
   Brig. Abdullah Haq Ulomi said the Afghan army would withdraw
from the border at ``the points that are needed _ several dozen if
necessary.''
   Ulomi heads the Afghan army department of the Central Committee
of the ruling People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   A foreign diplomat warned that U.S. officials were incorrect to
assume that guerrilla victories near the Pakistani border were
signs the Soviet-backed government was in trouble.
   ``We are very surprised by the optimism of American officials,''
said the diplomat, who asked not be identified.
   ``They believe the government of Najib will collapse after the
withdrawal of the Soviet troops, but this optimism seems to me and
to other Western observers to be very worrying because it is
absolutely not true,'' he said.
   Najib, in his speech at the Polytechnic Institute in Kabul,
called the Soviet withdrawal ``the significant event of the year.''
   He asserted that the Soviet troops have enabled the Afghan army
to maintain a military balance with the guerrillas.
   Najib said his army must maintain this balance and much has to
be done to prepare for the return of refugees.
   About 5 million Afghans _ one-third of the country's population
_ have fled since the Soviet intervention. About 3 milllion are in
Pakistan, and most of the rest are in Iran.
   Najib spoke in Dari for one hour to the Revolutionary
Organization of Afghanistan, the Peasants Organization of
Afghanistan and the Toilers Organization of Afghanistan. His
remarks were translated by government employees.
   The 10th anniversary of the revolution is Wednesday, but parades
and speeches marking the event will take place Tuesday.

   Eight U.S. servicemen who died in a failed
attempt to rescue 52 American hostages in Iran eight years ago were
honored Monday at a ceremony attended by relatives, friends and
military officials.
   ``Time is a great healer of pain,'' said Air Force Capt. Richard
Holmes, the brother Cpl. George Holmes Jr. of Pine Bluff, Ark., one
of the eight men who died during the abortive rescue mission in the
Iranian desert on April 25, 1980.
   ``Those feeling of sorrow have been replaced with feelings of
pride,'' he said.
   The men _ five from the Air Force and three from the Marine
Corps _ died when a helicopter collided with a transport plane
after officials decided to abandon the mission before entering
Tehran where 52 Americans were held inside the U.S. Embassy. The
hostages were freed in January 1981 after 444 days in captivity.
   Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr., former hostages Bruce Laingen
and Air Force Col. David Roeder were among those attending the
30-minute ceremony, held at Arlington National Cemetery across the
Potomac River from the nation's capital.
   Roeder said when he first learned of the rescue attempt while he
was incarcerated in Tehran he cried. He has great pride, he said,
in remembering those who were willing to die for freedom.
   After a presentation of colors by the U.S. Marine Corps Color
Guard, participants placed yellow roses on the headstone where
three of the eight are buried: Maj. Richard Bakke of Long Beach,
Calif.; Joel C. Mayo of Harrisville, Mich.; and Harold Lewis of
Fort Walton Beach, Fla.
   A wreath was then put near the plaque commemorating the eight.
The others were Sgt. John Harvey of Roanoke, Va.; Staff Sgt. Dewey
L. Johnson of Dublin, Ga.; Capt. Lyn D. McIntosh of Valdosta, Ga.;
and Capt. Charles McMillan of Corryton, Tenn.
   No Greater Love, a non-profit group that is dedicated to helping
the children and families of those killed by war or terrorism,
sponsored by ceremony.
   Carmella LaSpada, the group's chairwoman, said the ceremony also
provided an opportunity to remember the nine Americans held hostage
in Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
   Terry Anderson, captured in March 1985, is the longest-held
American in Lebanon. Anderson, the Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, already has been held three times longer than
the hostages in Iran, Ms. LaSpada said.

   Only a few weeks before a Soviet
pullout, Afghan guerrilla leaders are trying to maintain the
illusion of unity while they squabble over ways of establishing an
interim government in Afghanistan.
   Since the signing of the Geneva agreement on April 14, the
guerrillas _ who were not party to the accord _ also have stepped
up their war against the communists with about a dozen reported
operations inside the country.
   More than 180 enemy troops have been killed or wounded,
including 20 Soviets, the guerrillas say.
   ``What is clear is that in the current month and especially
since the signing of the Geneva accord, a significant number of
enemy military and command posts have fallen to the mujahedeen,''
said Burhaneddin Rabanni, leader of the Jamiat Islami Party, one
party in the seven-member anti-communist front.
   ``These are the last days of the war,'' contended Hamed Karzai,
spokesman for the moderate National Liberation Front. ``As in any
war, towards its end, fighting intensifies. Both sides try to
establish their hegemony.''
   Rabanni said soon after the Geneva accord was signed by the
United States, the Soviet Union, Pakistan and Afghanistan, the
guerrillas gave orders to all field commanders to launch attacks on
enemy strongholds.
   The rebels have also begun setting up new military bases inside
Afghanistan, he said.
   Last week's guerrilla takeover of the Afghan army garrison at
Barikot on the Pakistan border should aid the guerrillas in this
endeavor.
   The guerrillas said Friday's victory opened a new, direct supply
route for weapons into Afghanistan. President Najib acknowledged
the guerrilla victory on Sunday.
   On Monday, the guerrillas also claimed to have taken control of
three other strategic towns in recent weeks: Ghorband, 50 miles
north of Kabul, and Maarouf and Darwazgai, both in the south about
30 miles from the Pakistani bordar.
   The Soviet Union has said it will begin withdrawing its 115,000
troops from Afghanistan on May 15. Its troops entered Afghanistan
in 1979 to quell an uprsing by anti-communist guerrillas.
   On the political front, the the leaders of the seven-party
guerrilla alliance disagree about the structure of a ``provisional
government'' and how to go about setting it up.
   Ahmad Shah, a 44-year-old engineer with the hardline Ittihad
Islami Party who has been named president of the provisional
government, said the 14-member cabinet will meet once a week to
outline new programs and plans.
   But Sebaghatullah Mojadeddi, leader of the moderate National
Front believes the provisional government is a ``joke.''
   ``How can we have a government when it has not been approved by
the people,'' he said. ``Up to 700,000 Afghans are armed and when
the government is weak, there are going to be clashes and
bloodshed.''
   The parties are also divided over the form of elections to be
held for approving an interim government.
   Some want elections among the estimated 3 million Afghan
refugees in Pakistan: others favor elections inside Afghanistan as
well as in Pakistan.
   The guerrillas do agree on one thing: there is no chance for
reconciliation with Afghan President Najib and his communist
supporters.
   They differ, however, on the question of how to deal with the
communists should they be overthrown.
   Alliance chief Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, the most hardline of the
guerrilla leaders has called for a trial of Najib and other
communists.
   Mojaddedi, however, says if Najib and others ``repent'' and
``embrace Islam'' they ought to be pardoned.
   ``This is not the time for revenge,'' he said.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ban on Sexually Explicit Phone Services in
Arizona</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court, confronted with its first
``dial-a-porn'' case, today let stand a ban on sexually explicit
telephone dial-up message services in Arizona.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the ban violates free-speech rights.
   The court's action comes at a time when Congress, the Federal
Communications Commission and state governments have taken steps to
crack down on dial-a-porn companies whose services are available to
callers through 976 numbers and AT&T's 900 long-distance lines.
   Congress last week sent to the president a bill that would ban
all dial-a-porn services.
   American Civil Liberties Union lawyers said the proposed law
likely would be ruled unconstitutional. They support providing
means of having the services available only to those who want them.
   The FCC last week levied $600,000 in fines against two
California dial-a-porn firms accused of failing to prevent children
from hearing their messages.
   Among the states, the California Public Utilities Commission
most recently ordered the state's telephone companies to provide
low-cost blocking for customers who want to cut off access from
their phones to dial-a-porn and other pay services.
   Blocking is available to phone subscribers in 21 of the 34
states where local 976 services are available, according to a
recent survey by State Telephone Regulation Report, a
Virginia-based industry newsletter.
   Only in Utah can customers have 976 calls blocked at no cost.
   Anti-pornography groups do not like the blocking alternative to
flat bans because they say it puts a financial burden on the phone
subscriber and not the provider.
   The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other,
non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, time
checks and stock market and weather reports.
   Bradley Keirnes, vice president of Citizens for Decency Through
Law Inc., a public interest law firm based in Phoenix, Ariz.,
specializing in obscenity law, said the Supreme Court's decision
``clearly puts the ball in the phone companies' court.''
   He said the decision means AT&T and the Bell companies now can
pull the plug on dial-a-porn providers without fear of violating
the companies' First Amendment rights.
   In Arizona, Mountain Bell in 1985 announced a new policy banning
from its 976 message network all firms that ``provide adult
entertainment messages with sexually oriented content.''
   The policy _ not imposed in other states where Mountain Bell
provides phone service _ was challenged by two firms, Carlin
Communications Inc. and Sapphire Communications Inc., as impeding
their freedom of speech.
   Only the government or some agent of the government can violate
someone's constitutional rights, and so the two dial-a-porn
companies argued that Mountain Bell's policy represented ``state
action.''
   They noted that Mountain Bell is a heavily regulated public
utility and pointed to various pressures state authorities had put
on Mountain Bell to rid its 976 network of such message services.
   For example, the Maricopa County prosecutor cited a state
criminal law shielding minors from harmful items in a letter which
said, ``Should Mountain Bell continue to air these messages, it is
the intention of this office to prosecute not only the subscribers
who provide the messages but Mountain Bell.''
   A federal trial judge ruled that Mountain Bell could not refuse
to carry the dial-a-porn messages but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reversed that ruling last year.
   Noting that ``modern telephonic technology permits the pervasive
transmission of vast quantities of information, as well as
Shakespeare, Shaw and smut,'' the appeals court said Mountain
Bell's policy did not amount to ``state action.''
   A similar decision by another federal appeals court previously
enabled Southern Bell to keep dial-a-porn services out of Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the court's
denial of review to Carlin Communications vs. Mountain States
Telephone & Telegraph Co., 87-1479.

   Thunderstorms raced across the South and Midwest today after
tornadoes in Texas ripped through a mobile home park, injuring two
people and destroying several structures.
   Two tornadoes touched down north of Valdosta, Ga., today, one
near the tiny community of Bemiss and one to the east in Naylor,
said dispatcher Robert Rudd of the Lowndes County Sheriff's
Department.
   ``We've got severe damage,'' he said. One mobile home was
demolished in Bemiss, and wires and trees had fallen all across the
county, making several roads impassable, he said.
   There was no word of any injuries.
   Two men were injured Sunday night when their mobile home was
hurled onto a highway and destroyed in north-central Texas. The
men, ages 69 and 72, were hospitalized in stable condition.
   ``We received a report of heavy damage to two other mobile
homes, one nearby and another about one-quarter mile away, and a
barn,'' said Juan Fulton of the Parker County Fire Department.
   Thunderstorms with winds gusting up to 70 mph were scattered
Sunday night from western Oklahoma to south-central Texas.
   Rain and snow fell over the Rockies of northwest Wyoming and
western Montana. Snow advisories were in effect for the mountains
of Montana east of the Continental Divide and the northern
mountains of Wyoming, where 3-8 inches of snow was expected.
   Clear skies covered the Great Lakes region and portions of the
Ohio Valley this morning, while temperatures dropped to about the
freezing mark. Freeze or frost advisories were in effect for lower
Michigan, northern Indiana, Ohio and northeast Kentucky.
   The forecast for today called for showers and thunderstorms over
the lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee, Alabama, South Carolina,
Georgia and northern Florida; scattered showers and thunderstorms
over Utah, Colorado, Nebraska, eastern Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas;
rain or snow over the northern Rockies and the northern High
Plains; and rain or flurries scattered over northern New England.
   Much of the nation will have high temperatures in the 50s or
60s, while highs will be in the upper 30s and 40s over the northern
half of the Rockies, from eastern Montana to upper Michigan and
across northern New England; in the 70s and 80s over the southern
third of the country; and in the lower 90s over Florida and
southern Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 27 at
Gwinn, Mich., to 79 at Del Rio, Texas, and Key West, Fla.

   The rapist who savagely mutilated a
teen-age girl nine years ago is free from parole today, but friends
of Larry Singleton worry about his safety wherever he tries to
settle.
   When Singleton was paroled from prison a year ago, furious
protests followed him from town to town as state officials tried to
find a place for him to live.
   Protesters were outraged that the 60-year-old former merchant
marine served only eight years for his crime, a six-year reduction
because of good behavior and work credits.
   After Gov. George Deukmejian intervened, Singleton wound up in a
mobile home on the grounds of San Quentin prison. Last week
officials moved him to an undisclosed location.
   As of midnight Sunday, Singleton was free to go wherever he
liked and was under no obligation to tell prison officials his
whereabouts. He has told Thomas Clyde Smith Jr., leader of the
Bride of Christ Church in Azalea, Ore., he would like to live there
after first visiting his sister in Florida.
   But his safety is uncertain, say some of Singleton's supporters.
   After news reports Singleton might live at the Oregon church
farm, several shots were fired at its buildings, said Bob Plath, an
attorney and member of Teachers Network Foundation, a religious
group that befriended Singleton during his parole.
   ``This is a country of laws,'' Plath said in a recent interview.
``He served his time. He has a right to be left alone and left in
peace.''
   Singleton's victim, Mary Vincent, lives in seclusion in the
Pacific Northwest, and said in published interviews recently that
her fear has been revived by Singleton's impending freedom.
   ``I'll never get over this,'' said Vincent.
   Singleton hacked off her forearms with an ax on Sept. 29, 1978,
and left her for dead in Stanislaus County, 45 miles east of San
Francisco.
   She recently had Singleton served with a $2.4 million judgment
won in a civil lawsuit against him last year in Nevada. She filed
the Nevada order in Orange County Superior Court earlier this month
after Singleton wrote to county prosecutors asking that they
investigate his claim that it was Vincent who attacked him.
   Public outrage has continued almost unabated since Singleton's
release.
   ``Here's a girl who lost her arms and will never get them back,
and here's the guy who did it. He got 14 years and he's out in
eight,'' said Stanislaus County District Attorney Donald Stahl, who
prosecuted Singleton.
   ``There ain't no justice _ it's the thing I hear over and over
and over from everyone.''
   Singleton has insisted he was innocent, adding that he believes
she attacked him. ``I never live in the past,'' he said in a recent
television interview.
   He also passed a lie detector test set up by the Teachers
Network Foundation, which quizzed him on the crime. Former FBI
Special Agent Francis Connolly, who administered the test, said it
only proves that Singleton believes he is innocent. The test was
demonstrated on a recent public television program about Singleton.
   In 1979, a jury in San Diego convicted Singleton of kidnap,
rape, mayhem and attempted murder in the attack on Vincent, then
age 15. He was sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison.
   Vincent was discovered naked on a rural road. She told police
her attacker was a man named Larry who picked her up in Berkeley
and told her he would take her to Los Angeles but instead took her
to a deserted area near Modesto.
   Singleton was arrested 10 days later in Sparks, Nev. Detectives
found the burned remains of Vincent's clothes in the fireplace of
Singleton's house in San Pablo.

   The partially clad bodies of three people
were found by a motorist outside an abandoned pool hall, and
authorities said today the victims were killed execution-style by a
half-dozen shotgun blasts.
   The victims were identified as Bernie Gene McKnight, 30, of
Canton, Mich., and Paul H. Blackwood II, 26, and Lisa Rose Vega,
33, both of Osceola, said Lt. J.C. Brewer of the Mississippi County
Sheriff's Department.
   Brewer said the Osceola residents were apparently acquainted,
but he didn't know their connection, if any, to McKnight.
   Asked about a motive for the slayings, which apparently happened
Sunday night, Brewer said: ``We have got only speculation. We have
no suspects.'' He said his agency and state police investigators
were checking on possibilities that the deaths stemmed from a
domestic dispute or might have been drug-related.
   The bodies were discovered by a motorist in eastern Arkansas
about five miles from Interstate 55 and some 30 miles north of
Memphis, Tenn., said Mississippi County Sheriff Howard Carney.
   ``This area is out in the rural part of our county, off a gravel
county road. It's completely isolated,'' Brewer said.
   The bodies were about 10 feet apart, Carney said, and a
half-dozen spent 12-gauge shotgun shells were found on the ground.
   A 1988 Lincoln found at the scene was registered to the mother
of the Osceola man, Brewer said.
   Large portions of the victims' heads were blown away, officers
said, and two of the bodies also had extensive damage to their
arms, indicating they had placed their hands in front of their
faces as they were killed.
   According to Carney, one of the men had his shirt off and his
pants unzipped. The other man had his pants around his ankles. The
woman was clad only in sweatpants.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
   
   The court said it will consider overturning a key civil rights
precedent allowing people to sue private citizens accused of racial
discrimination. Four dissenting justices accused the court of
undermining the trust minority groups have in it.
   The court, in an extraordinary move, said it will use a North
Carolina case involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment to
consider throwing out a 12-year-old decision.
   The case is Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union, 87-107.
   
   PHONE PORN
   
   The court let stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone dial-up
message services in Arizona.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the ban violates free-speech rights. It was the first dial-a-porn
case with which the court was confronted.
   The case is Carlin Communications vs. Mountain States Telephone
& Telegraph Co., 87-1479.
   
   PRISON PUBLICATIONS
   
   The court agreed to consider giving federal prison wardens more
power to decide what publications inmates may read.
   The court said it will review a ruling that limits the authority
of officials to censor reading material behind prison bars.
   The case is Meese vs. Abbott, 87-1344.
   
   AGNEW
   
   The court turned away an appeal by former Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew in a lawsuit alleging he was cheated out of more than $2
million for arranging a deal between a defense contractor and the
Argentine government.
   The justices, without comment, refused to order the setting
aside of more than $340,000 in a special fund Agnew and another
businessman would receive if they win the lawsuit.
   The case is Agnew vs. Alicanto, 87-1464.
   
   AIR SPACE
   
   The court let stand a ruling that property owners' rights are
not violated when they are required to remove structures that could
interfere with low-flying planes.
   The court, citing the lack of a ``substantial federal
question,'' rejected an appeal by a Cheyenne, Wyo., man fined $200
a day for refusing to trim a 48-foot cottonwood tree on his
property.
   The case is Rogers vs. Cheyenne, 87-1462.
   
   SEX BIAS
   
   The court turned away a case in which Missouri officials were
found guilty of sex discrimination by not hiring enough women as
highway maintenance workers.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by state
officials who said lower courts improperly weighed the evidence.
   The justices also refused to hear an appeal by women who said
remedies ordered by the lower courts were inadequate.
   The cases are Missouri Highway Commission vs. Catlett, 87-1415,
and Catlett vs. Missouri Highway Commission, 87-1416.
   
   RELIGIOUS RIGHTS
   
   The court turned down an appeal by native Hawaiians who say
plans for developing geothermal energy in a volcanic area will
violate their religious rights.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the proposed
development will not interfere unlawfully with access to sacred
land by worshippers of the goddess Pele.
   The case is Dedman vs. Hawaii Board of Land and Natural
Resources, 87-605.

   President Reagan is still mulling whether to
increase U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf, a White
House spokesman said today, amid indications of fresh
administration concern about the American presence there.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said a number of options are still
being weighed and that ``no decisions have been made'' on the
possible broadening of the U.S. escort role for neutral ships in
the strategic waterway.
   But Fitzwater contradicted remarks that administration officials
had made last Friday, indicating a decision had been made to expand
the U.S. role to allow American warships to protect neutral vessels
under attack.
   Officials, who declined to be named publicly, said last week
that a more aggressive U.S. policy in the gulf had been decided
upon. They said such a policy was aimed at deterring Iranian
attacks against gulf shipping. The change in policy, they said at
the time, was a direct result of the mining of a U.S. frigate and
Monday's extensive fighting between Iranian and U.S. forces.
   But during his daily White House briefing today, Fitzwater
talked of the possibility of returning U.S. forces in the gulf to
the limited rules of engagement that applied before last Monday,
when the United States attacked two Iranian platforms and the two
nations' forces subsequently exchanged fire.
   While the spokesman emphasized that several options remained
under study, Fitzwater indicated a concern within the
administration about an Americanization of the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``Right now the rules of engagement are essentially the same as
they were last week, reflecting the emergency nature of the
situation,'' he said. ``But the question is, where do we move back
to? But I can't discuss specifics.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, interviewed from Brussels,
Belgium, on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program, also indicated a U.S.
interest in restraining the role of American military involvement
in the gulf.
   ``We will not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the
Iranians,'' Shultz said. He added that the final decision is up to
Reagan _ and that it hasn't yet been made.
   ``As far as our rules of engagement are concerned, what the
right ones are for this stage of the game in the gulf are being
considered in Washington, and there is a process of consultation
going on and I think it's premature to describe them in any
particular way,'' Shultz said.
   Fitzwater said that ``during the conflict last Monday, the rules
(of engagement) were changed to accommodate the military situation
that was encountered.''
   ``You'll recall at that point that our ships were engaging
hostile forces in any number of areas, and we now want to move back
to our conservative set of rules. And so that decision has to be
made about where to move back to,'' he said. ``You see, the rules
were changed to accommodate the military aggression that was
encountered that day. Once that is no longer the case, we want to
move to something that would be more sustainable in the long term.''
   Among the options being examined is adding Coast Guard ships to
assist the U.S. Navy fleet in the Persian Gulf, where an Iranian
gunboat attack on a neutral vessel drew a muted reaction from U.S.
officials Sunday.
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
the attack on a Saudi-owned tanker reflected a ``level of violence
... much less'' than in the mining incident that touched off last
week's U.S. retaliatory strike against two Iranian offshore
platforms.
   ``We consider our response on Monday a suitable response for the
indiscriminate mining, and we do not contemplate any more violence
unless Iran continues what we would say is an indiscriminate and a
threatening pattern,'' Crowe said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   The captain of the Saudi-owned Sea Trader said there were no
casualties but the ship suffered slight damage in the grenade and
machine gun attack at 7:30 a.m. Sunday (11:30 p.m. EDT Saturday).
   On the option of adding Coast Guard vessels, Defense Secretary
Frank Carlucci said the use of the crafts would provide more
flexibility in the gulf, but no decision has been made.
   ``They have somewhat smaller ships which give a better
patrolling capability. It would free our larger ships for other
missions,'' Carlucci said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.''
   Crowe said Coast Guard vessels would be ideal for assisting
warships in the escort of merchant vessels, watching sea lanes to
prevent mine-laying and guarding offshore installations from
attacks by small craft.
   The Coast Guard vessels the Pentagon may send to the gulf are
lightly armed, Island-class patrol craft now used mainly against
drug traffic in the Caribbean, the service said today.
   the 110-foor-long ships travel at a maximum speed of 26 knots
and carry two officers, two chief petty officers and an additional
crew of up to 14.
   The ships are armed with one 20 mm machine gun in the front, and
two 7.62 mm machine guns elsewhere, said spokesman Nicholas
Sandifer. Jane's Fighting Ships says each craft can carry an
additional 20 mm machine gun.
   The United States remains officially neutral in the 7{-year-old
Iran-Iraq war although it used U.S. warships to guard
American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from attacks since last summer.
   The Iranian attack on the Sea Trader came hours after Reagan, in
his weekly radio address, warned Iran that ``continued military and
terrorist attacks against nonbelligerents and refusal to negotiate
an end to the war will be very costly to Iran and its people.''

   It's not a rumor. Mick Fleetwood,
patriarch of Fleetwood Mac, is married.
   The 200 guests Sunday afternoon included Stevie Nicks and other
band members, past and present, as well as Malibu neighbors Dick
Clark and Ali MacGraw, singer Dave Mason and Jeff Lynne of the
Electric Light Orchestra.
   Fleetwood, 40, and his longtime girlfriend Sara Recor, 32,
recited their vows at Fleetwood's home on a bluff overlooking the
Pacific, said publicist Mitchell Schneider.
   The rock bandleader wore a white tux with tails and the bride
wore a white gown. Friend and fellow band member John McVie was
best man.
   The couple will return from a brief honeymoon later this week
for the band's scheduled trip to England, Schneider said.
   The venerable band was formed in 1967 and has gone through many
personnel changes while producing such hit albums as ``Rumours''
and singles like ``Over My Head,'' ``Rhiannon,'' ``Say You Love
Me,'' ``Go Your Own Way,'' ``You Make Loving Fun'' and ``Dreams.''

   Same time next year if you want to hear Spanish
crooner Julio Iglesias take a shot at Chinese.
   Iglesias crooned love songs in Spanish, French and English to an
enthralled studio audience as he recorded a program for China
Central Television on Monday, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported.
   With hostess Wei Hua, Iglesias performed a duet of his hit song,
``To All the Girls I've Loved Before,'' which he has recorded with
country star Willy Nelson.
   Iglesias sang 19 songs during the concert, to be aired

   From television host to Vegas showgirl _
not the usual route to stardom. But Mary Hart has the legs for the
job.
   In a show that ranged from torrid dance numbers to Gershwin
ballads, the ``Entertainment Tonight'' host made her Vegas debut at
the Golden Nugget as the opening act for comedian David Brenner.
   ``It's been a dream of mine for years to be singing and dancing
on stage,'' she told her audience in a weekend show.
   Hart said she decided to give song-and-dance a try after
appearing last year on a television special marking 75 years of
entertainment in Las Vegas.
   She is commuting nightly from her ``Entertainment Tonight'' post
to Las Vegas for the show, which runs through May 3.
   She opened the 45-minute show with a dance number entitled ``Hot
Legs.''
   ``I certainly hope you're a leg man,'' she told a man sitting
near the stage.
   ``If not, I'll change,'' he responded.

   Corbin Bernsen, the sleazy divorce lawyer on
television's ``L.A. Law,'' says his real-life persona only vaguely
resembles the image he projects on screen.
   ``I'm like him in that we are both ambitious and career-minded.
I'm unlike him in that I just won't step on people the way he
will,'' the 33-year-old Bernsen said in a recent interview.
   Bernsen does lift weights and he sweats over his rowing machine
at his Malibu home, just as Arnie Becker does on his Pacific coast
estate.
   But Becker's womanizing doesn't carry over in Bernsen's private
life. Once married, Bernsen says he is now single and in love.
   ``It's kind of coming together right now,'' said Bernsen, who
won't identify his love interest and refers the questioner to the
supermarket tabloids. He is seen most often with actress Amanda
Pays.

   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) _ Former dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier must stand trial in France on a civil suit brought by the
Haitian government over the diversion of $120 million in public
funds, a court ruled Monday.
   The appeals court ruled France has jurisdiction to hear Haiti's
demand for money it claims Duvalier, known as ``Baby Doc,'' took
during his 15 years in power. Trial was set for June 27.
   The Haitian government has accused Duvalier and members of his
entourage of diverting $120 million to personal use. Haiti says
Duvalier used the money to buy jewelry, luxury cars, a castle near
Paris and other property.
   ``It is very satisfying for us,'' Yann Colin, representing the
Haitian government, said of the ruling.
   Duvalier was 19 when he became president of Haiti after his
father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, died. He and his family
were forced to flee Haiti on Feb. 7, 1986.
   On Saturday Le Monde ran a story on Duvalier and his wife,
Michele, tracing purchases they have allegedly made since their
arrival. The newspaper said French authorities are curious about
where the Duvaliers' money is coming from.
   The newspaper said most of their payments are made in cash,
including utilities, telephone, rent on their mansion and about
$212,000 in 1986 attorneys fees.

   Michael Dukakis' campaign manager and Mario
Cuomo's son have been added to the National Law Journal's list of
the nation's 100 most powerful lawyers, but U.S. Attorney General
Edwin Meese has been dropped.
   Others deleted from a list compiled in 1985 included former
Texas Gov. John Connally and White House chief of staff Howard
Baker.
   Meese, the Journal said, ``remains by virtue of his position
among the most powerful lawyers as his term ends, but a string of
continuing investigations into his ethical and legal conduct has
weakened his influence and reduced the prestige and current clout
of the office.''
   Connally, also a former Treasury secretary, declared bankruptcy
last year, the Journal noted. And Baker ``remains powerful _ but
not as a lawyer.''
   Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor's 30-year-old son and one of
his closest advisers, is the youngest person on the list. ``Friends
say he's smart enough to be important even if he weren't the
governor's son,'' said the Journal.
   Susan Estrich, Dukakis' aide, is on leave from Harvard Law
School, where she teaches constitutional law. At 35, she has become
the first woman to manage a major presidential candidate's campaign.

   Kraft Inc. wants to dig up the remains
of members of several farm families and move them to an established
cemetery, but some local officials are fighting the plans.
   ``These were the settlers of our community. This site should not
be disturbed,'' said Northfield Township Supervisor Gregg Goslin.
   ``We are looking at an irreplaceable part of this community's
history,'' he said recently as he picked his way through underbrush
surrounding the cemetery northwest of Chicago.
   Goslin said he is trying to persuade Kraft officials to change
their plans to uproot the overgrown cemetary in order to construct
a new office building.
   But Kraft doesn't want the ``abandoned and long neglected''
cemetery in its front yard, said spokeswoman Magnes Welsh.
   The cemetary hasn't had a new burial since June 1924. Many of
the headstones are no longer legible and are partly covered with
earth.
   The company wants to dig up the graves and move them to an
established cemetery, she said.
   But Kraft needs permission from the Northfield Township Board of
Trustees before it moves the remains of the estimated 20 people
buried there.
   The board has scheduled a public hearing on the request for next
month.

   The Security Council voted 14-0 today to
condemn the assassination of PLO deputy commander Khalil al-Wazir.
   The United States abstained from voting. It could have vetoed
the resolution.
   Tunisian officials and Israeli sources say Israeli commandos
gunned down Wazir, the Palestine Liberation Organization's
52-year-old military commander, at his home in suburban Tunis on
April 16. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.
   The Security Council resolution condemns the slaying but does
not explicitly criticize Israel. However, the resolution approved
today does refer to a 1985 resolution passed after Israel bombed
PLO headquarters in Tunis. The 1985 measure condemned Israel and
demanded that it refrain from further ``acts of aggression.''
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert Okun said the United States could not
vote in favor of the resolution today because it lays all the blame
on Israel without taking note of Arab aggression against the Jewish
state.
   He also praised Tunisia as a peaceful nation and a friend of the
United States.
   ``The perpetration of politic assassination on Tunisian soil
stands in stark contrast to Tunisia's longstanding tradition of
non-violence,'' he said.
   Both Tunisia and the PLO expressed satisfaction with the U.S.
abstention. The United States generally uses its veto to shield
Israel in the council.
   Scores of speakers harshly condemned Israel for practicing state
terrorism and warned that Wazir's murder would not end the unrest
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Wazir, known as Abu Jihad, was the mastermind of the
4{-month-old Palestinian uprising in the territories.
   His slaying has served as a catalyst for possible reconciliation
between Syria and the PLO, something many Arab leaders believe
could help forge Arab unity.
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez Assad met
today in Damascus, only their second face-to-face meeting since
Arafat was expelled from Syria in 1983.
   Council members who belong to the movement of nations professing
non-alignment with either superpower _ Algeria, Argentina, Nepal,
Senegal, Yugoslavia and Zambia _ sponsored the resolution on
Tunisia's complaint.
   The other current council members are the Soviet Union, Britain,
France, China, Brazil, Italy, Japan and West Germany.

<TEXT>
   The chief of oral surgery at
Aurora's Fitzsimons Army Medical Center has been accused of trying
to inject his hospitalized wife with a suspected pesticide, police
said.
   Police Sgt. Joe Kenda said Sunday the alleged incident was the
result of an ``ongoing dispute of a domestic nature.''
   Col. Dennis Earl Parmer, 52, of Colorado Springs, was arrested
late Saturday at Penrose Hospital here after a lab technician said
he saw a syringe stuck into his wife Carol's intravenous support
system, police said.
   Parmer was held in El Paso County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bond
on suspicion of attempted first-degree murder. He was still there
Monday, according to authorities.
   Carol Parmer, 44, was moved to the intensive care unit after the
incident and was listed in good condition. At the time of the
incident, she was being treated for deep-vein phlebitis _ a
clotting and inflammation of veins of the leg, officials said.
   ``We can't be sure if poison was injected'' until toxicology
tests are completed, said hospital spokesman Dr. Michael Guthrie.
``Clinically, she seems fine.''
   Lab technicians with the coroner's office were analyzing the
suspected pesticide to determine what it is and how it would affect
a human body, El Paso County Coroner Dr. David Bowerman said.
   The alleged attempted poisoning occurred during the end of
visiting hours Saturday, Guthrie said.
   ``A hospital employee came into the room to do a blood drawing
on another patient and happened to see what was going on,'' said
Guthrie.
   Police at first thought the incident might have been an
attempted mercy killing.
   Guthrie said although the woman's phlebitis is serious it is
``not life threatening and certainly not terminal.''
   A ``serious incident report'' will eventually be forwarded to
the Pentagon for review, officials said.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Hawaiian Religious-Rights Appeal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs last 2 grafs to show Supreme Court already has ruled on
similar case.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned down an appeal
by native Hawaiians who say plans for developing geothermal energy
in a volcanic area will violate their religious rights.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the proposed
development will not interfere unlawfully with access to sacred
land by worshippers of the goddess Pele.
   The native Hawaiians said the development ``by turning a
pristine, virgin rain forest into a spiderweb of pipelines, roads,
geothermal wells and production plants ... would by accepted
religious doctrine destroy the goddess Pele.''
   Pele was described as ``the magma, the heat, the vapor, the
steam and the cosmic creation which occur in volcanic eruptions.
She is seen by Pele people in the lava, images of her standing
erect, dancing and extending her arms with her hair flowing into
the steam and clouds.''
   At issue are more than 9,000 acres of land in an area called the
Kilauea Middle East Rift Zone on the island of Hawaii.
   The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in July that state officials did
not infringe on the religious practices of the natives by setting
aside the land for geothermal development.
   The state court noted that the development site was moved about
five to 10 miles from a location ``where tradition suggests Pele
resides.'' The state court said the natives failed to prove
significant harm would be done to their religious practices.
   But the worshippers of Pele said it is impossible to identify
the precise sacred areas where they are commanded by the goddess to
conduct private ceremonial rituals. The precise sites are revealed
by mysterious signs, they said.
   The Supreme Court last week ruled in a similar case from
California that road-building and timber-harvesting in a national
forest does not violate Indians' freedom of religion even if land
they consider sacred is altered.
   The case acted on today is Dedman vs. Hawaii Board of Land and
Natural Resources, 87-605.

<TEXT>
   An American trying to become the first
woman to complete the 2,000-mile trans-Himalayan run arrived in
Katmandu on Monday _ behind schedule and with a broken foot, but
determined to carry on.
   ``Although I'm 10 days behind schedule, I will catch up,'' said
Mary Margaret Goodwin after she emerged from the woods with her pet
dog, Velia.
   Goodwin said she had broken her foot two weeks earlier and will
see a doctor on Tuesday.
   ``But there is nothing which will prevent me'' from finishing
the run, Goodwin, 50, declared.
   Goodwin, from Fort Lewis, Wash., started out from Darjeeling,
India, and traveled 400 miles before reaching the Nepalese capital
more than six weeks later with her 2-year-old German shorthair
pointer.
   She said she had been trying to break a 1984 record set by two
British brothers, Adrian and Dick Crane, in which they completed
the trans-Himalayan run in 92 days.
   But ``I can't find the route they mentioned in their report. The
route that I took was definitely longer,'' Goodwin said.
   She said she had been suffering from high fever for the last
four days and has already lost about 31 pounds.
   ``Two nights ago, I almost collapsed,'' she added. ``But, I'm
optimistic of completing the whole trip. I think the worst part of
it is over now.''
   She said she had been completing about 10 miles to 50 miles a
day.
   The Darjeeling-Katmandu route is the ``hardest mileage I have
ever done in my life,'' added Goodwin, a veteran long-distance
runner. ``This is not only running, but climbing too. The weather
turned out very hostile this year. It was snowing in the Everest
region,'' she said.
   Goodwin became the first woman to run the 1,000-mile route
through Scotland, Wales and England, and also completed a
2,000-mile trip through Japan in 1986.
   She is scheduled to leave Katmandu on Thursday and reach Gulmarg
in Kashmir, India, by early June to finish the run.

   Police arrested Jerusalem wholesalers Monday
who were said to be helping the Palestinian rebellion in the
occupied lands, and soldiers confiscated identity cards of several
dozen Arabs accused of inciting violence.
   Military spokesmen said a navy patrol craft sank a rubber boat
off the Lebanese coast before dawn, killing an undetermined number
of Palestinian guerrillas. Israel radio said two guerrillas were in
the boat.
   Israel radio said loss of their documents would prevent the Gaza
Strip Palestinians from entering Israel. It said the Arabs also
were ordered to check in with Gaza police twice a day.
   At least 173 Palestinians have been killed since riots began
Dec. 8 among the 1.5 million Arabs of the occupied West Bank and
Gaza, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
An Israeli soldier and Jewish settler also have been killed.
   Violence has declined in the past few days and Palestinians are
expressing frustration with the failure of underground leaders to
provide enough financial aid to offset economic sanctions imposed
by the Israelis.
   ``The Palestinians are asking where is all the support money the
underground leadership said it would provide,'' said Mubarak Awad,
an Arab-American who promotes non-violent resistance to Israeli
rule.
   He added, however: ``The people are frustrated, but they aren't
giving up.''
   Soldiers ordered shops in Bethlehem and Jerusalem to stay closed
Monday afternoon. Underground leaders of the Palestine Liberation
Organizaation leaders told them to open.
   Soldiers in Bethlehem welded shut the doors of six shops that
followed PLO instructions. In Jerusalem, police arrested 14
merchants who opened their shops.
   ``Whoever is given an order must follow it,'' said Avi Cohen, a
senior Jerusalem police official who watched riot police and
officers on horseback close the stores on the Street of the
Prophets near the walled Old City.
   The 14 shop owners could face up to two years in jail. They
opened their stores across from the Damascus Gate at 2 p.m.,
abiding by the PLO order, and police closed them three minutes
later.
   Israeli authorities want Arab merchants to open all day, but
leaders of the rebellion have ordered stores opened only in the
afternoon. Army instructions Monday were that shops on the Street
of the Prophets remain closed.
   Cohen said: ``Indictments will be handed up in a few days, and
the matter will be brought before the court.''
   A merchant who locked his shop while watched by police said:
``There's no law which says when you must open or close.''
   Crowds of shoppers patronized open shops on nearby streets.
   When asked why the Street of the Prophets was singled out, Cohen
replied: ``You have to start somewhere.'' But Nabil Feidy, a
merchant on Saladin Street close by, said those arrested were
wholesalers who supplied essential goods to the West Bank to help
keep the rebellion going.
   ``They are the ones who send all kinds of flour to the refugee
camps,'' he said.
   Other Arabs, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the
14 merchants had supplied goods to underground committees that run
the rebellion.
   Dr. Hyder Abdulshafi, a prominent physician in the Gaza Strip,
said soldiers there, in addition to confiscating identity cards,
were forcing people to report to tax offices even if they did not
owe taxes.
   ``They have to wait on line for hours and hours standing in the
sun,'' he said. ``It's the name of the game. They are putting
pressure on residents. They are trying to make them give up.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was quoted as calling for action
against two American journalists who did not submit to the military
censor stories about Israeli involvement in the assassination of
PLO military commander Khalil Wazir.
   Foreign journalists are required to give the censor any material
involving security matters.
   Israeli newspapers quoted defense sources as saying authorities
were considering expelling Martin Fletcher of NBC and Glenn Frankel
of the Washington Post, but Israel radio quoted Shamir as
indicating lighter measures.
   ``Maybe they should not be expelled from the country, but they
should be punished,'' the radio quoted Shamir as saying.
   Fletcher made the first reports of Israeli involvement in
Wazir's killing April 16 in Tunis, and Frankel reported details of
the operation. Israeli sources have said Wazir was killed by
Israeli commandos, but the government has not confirmed it.

<HEAD>State Department Says Najib Call for Better Ties is `Absurd'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A call by Afghanistan's President Najib for
better relations with the United States is ``absurd,'' the State
Department said Monday.
   In an interview with a 12-member, private U.S. delgation, parts
of which were published Monday in The Washington Post, Najib said
he was ready ``for any kinds of compromise'' with the U.S.-backed
rebels trying to topple his Soviet-backed government.
   One possible compromise is for the return of exiled King
Mohammed Zahir to act as a rallying point for a broad-based
government that would run the country after the Soviets withdraw
their troops, he said.
   Moscow, which sent elements of the Red Army into Afghanistan in
1979, has undertaken to start pulling out some 115,000 troops on
May 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord.
   ``All the conditions are now present and I think the Americans
could play a great role,'' Najib was quoted as saying. ``We want to
live in friendship with the United States of America without losing
any element of our friendship with the Soviet Union.''
   But a State Department spokeswoman, Phyllis Oakley, said that
since the United States views the Soviet-appointed Najib government
as illegitimate, ``I think the question of our improving relations
with it is absurd.''
   She labeled Najib's comments Soviet propaganda.
   In his talk with the Americans, mostly retired officials and
U.S. business executives, Najib also said he would only accept a
cutoff of Soviet aid to his government if the U.S. stopped aiding
its rebel allies.
   ``That comment we also view as absurd, of equating Soviet aid to
the regime in Kabul with U.S. assistance to the government of
Pakistan,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   The United States has said it would stop arming and financing
the seven rebel groups if the Soviets end their support for the
Najib government.
   Mrs. Oakley said the delegation went to Kabul ``strictly in a
private capacity and has no sanction whatsoever from the U.S.
government.
   ``In fact, before the group members departed for Kabul, we
recommended that they not make the trip and alerted them to the
likelihood that the Afghan and Soviet propaganda organs would
exploit their activities.''
   This is the first U.S. delegation to visit Afghanistan since the
1979 Soviet incursion. Robert E. White, who heads the group, said
after the Najib interview that the Afghan government would have to
share power with the rebels before any change could be made in ties
with the United States.
   Two members of the group boycotted the 80-minute interview to
show their disapproval for Najib and their support for the rebels,
the Post said.

   Consideration by the Pentagon to give the
financially strapped Coast Guard a role in Persian Gulf patrols ran
into heavy sailing Monday on Capitol Hill.
   ``Ridiculous, hare-brained, absolute utter nonsense,'' was the
reaction of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who has criticized the
Reagan administration for not devoting more resources to battle
against drugs, including seizures of imports.
   ``I've never heard of anything so stupid,'' D'Amato told a
reporter. ``Do they think the war on drugs is over?''
   Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, ranking Republican on the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said, ``I don't know what the rationale
for that would be. We've put a lot of additional burdens on the
Coast Guard in the last few years and I'd think they have a full
plate.''
   The committee will meet later this week to consider shifting
money to the Coast Guard because the service has responded to a
$100 million budget shortfall by suspending routine search and
rescue patrols and cutting anti-drug missions by 55 percent.
   ``They don't have to go to the Persian Gulf to get money,'' said
Hatfield.
   Pentagon officials said in weekend that consideration was being
given to send up to a half-dozen 110-foot Coast Guard patrol boats
to the Persian Gulf. They would be part of the U.S. policy of
protecting 11 reflagged Kuwaiti tankers against attacks by Iran.
   The lightly armed ``Island'' class patrol boats would be pulled
off anti-drug patrols in the Caribbean, Coast Guard officials said
Monday. The boats would be replaced by new Coast Guard cutters now
under construction.
   Nicholas Sandifer, a Coast Guard spokesman, said ``any effect on
drug interdiction would be minimal and temporary.''
   Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said Sunday that moving the
patrol boats to the gulf ``would free our larger (Navy) ships for
other missions.''
   Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said the Coast Guard ships could help escort merchant ships, watch
sea lanes, prevent mine-laying, and guard offshore installations
from small-boat attacks.
   Crowe admitted that if the boats are needed for anti-drug
patrols, that need ``would severely complicate the calculus.''
   Adm. Paul A. Yost, commandant of the Coast Guard, said Monday
the service could be ready to send patrol boats to the gulf region
in 60 days.
   ``If the president, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, think those
boats would be a help over there, I'm more than delighted to send
them and my Coast Guard personnel are ready to go,'' Yost told
reporters. ``Really raring and ready to go.''
   Administratively, the Coast Guard is part of the Transportation
Department, but by law, the agency also falls under Defense
Department jurisdiction for national security purposes.
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Navy has offered to pay the Coast Guard's expenses in mounting
the gulf patrols.
   The Coast Guard has been hit hard by budget cuts that have
resulted from deficit-reduction efforts. The service has a $2.7
billion budget this year, which Yost says is $100 million less than
needed.
   As result, the Coast Guard in February closed almost 30 stations
and offices, cut anti-drug patrols, and halted routine rescue
patrols.
   The administration last month came up with a plan to shift money
within the Transportation Department and permit more anti-drug
patrols. That proposal has yet to be approved by Congress.
   The ``Island'' class boats that would be used in the gulf
operations have a maximum speed of more than 26 knots and carry a
crew of 16, according to Sandifer. The vessels are armed with one
20mm machine gun in the front, and two 7.62mm machine guns
elsewhere. Another 20mm machine gun can be added.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a member of the Armed Services
Committee, said, ``Those boats could be good, but they don't have
any of their own defense against missiles and that's what our ships
are running into these days in the gulf.''
   ``I'm willing to look at the proposal, but as of right now, it
doesn't make a lot of sense,'' said Glenn. ``I hate to see us pull
the Coast Guard off drug work.''
   Last fall, the Pentagon considered sending Coast Guard vessels
to the gulf, but decided against the idea, in part because the
boats are so lightly armed.
   Iran has attacked shipping with a variety of boats, particularly
speedboats. The Iranians have at least two dozen Swedish-made
``Boghammer'' boats, which have been armed with machine guns and
rocket launchers.

   President Hafez Assad and PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat met Monday, seeking to end five years of bloody
rivalry and to revive a hardline alliance against Israel and a U.S.
peace plan.
   Presidential spokesman Jibrane Kourieh said the two key Arab
leaders met for 3{ hours in Assad's Muhajirine palace and talked in
particular about the Palestinian uprising in Israel and the need to
support it.
   ``We all agreed that this is a rare opportunity ... that would
lead to the restoration of warm relations between Syria and the
PLO,'' Palestinian leader Nayef Hawatmeh said before the meeting.
   It was the second time that Arafat and Assad have talked
face-to-face since the Syrian president threw the PLO leader out of
Syria in June 1983. They met briefly at the Arab summit in Amman,
Jordan, in November.
   If their talks are successful, it will mean the end of a rift
that seriously hampered Arab efforts to unite in opposition to
Israel.
   Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa and seven of Arafat's
senior aides _ all members of the ruling central committee of
Fatah, the main PLO guerrilla group _ attended the meeting in the
heavily guarded palace, the spokesman said.
   Like Arafat, most of them had not visited Damascus since Arafat
was expelled at the height of a Syrian-backed mutiny in the PLO.
   Arafat's aides arrived in Damascus last week for the funeral of
the PLO's military commander, Khalil Wazir, assassinated in Tunis,
Tunisia, on April 16.
   Israeli sources have said Wazir was killed by Israeli commandos,
but the government has not confirmed it.
   Arafat failed to show up for the funeral Wednesday and flew in
Sunday from Libya after Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi and
Algerian President Chadli Benjedid intervened.
   Monday's crucial session followed a meeting between Assad and a
ranking Libyan envoy, Lt. Col. Mustafa Kharroubi, who accompanied
Arafat from Tripoli to Damascus on Sunday. Officials released no
details of that meeting.
   Hawatmeh, who leads the Marxist Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said that Arafat's three-hour session with
Palestinian leaders hammered out an agenda for the future.
   Hawatmeh said the top priorities were the Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the
United States' latest Middle East peace plan, presented to the
region's leaders last month by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``These are two very important developments, how to bolster the
uprising and foil Shultz's plan,'' Hawatmeh said.
   Syria and the PLO have separately rejected Shultz's proposal for
limited Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories. Both
want an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.
   The peace plan also does not give the PLO a role in the peace
process.
   Arabs, however, regard the PLO as the sole representative of the
world's 5 million Palestinians.
   Asked if it was not too early to talk of an alliance when Arafat
has been in Damascus only 24 hours, Hawatmeh declared: ``The fact
that he's here means the feud is over.
   ``Now we have to move on to the next stage, reviving the
strategic alliance.''
   Libya and Algeria, along with Syria, the PLO and Marxist South
Yemen, formed what was called the Arab Steadfastness Front after
the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt signed the 1978
U.S.-brokered Camp David accord that led to a peace treaty with
Israel a year later.
   The anti-peace accord alliance fell apart when the Syria-PLO
feud began.
   The feud erupted after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982.
   Arafat at that time refused to set up headquarters in Damascus
and began looking into the prospects of negotiating peace with
Israel.
   That angered Assad and PLO radicals, who advocated armed
struggle against Israel.
   In May 1983, the friction exploded into a battle between
Arafat's supporters and Syrian-backed hardliners seeking to oust
the guerrilla chief from the PLO leadership.
   Arab leaders have been trying to reconcile Assad and Arafat
since the split but Wazir's assassination accelerated the process.
The 52-year-old native of Ramle, now in Israel, was respected by
both Arafat loyalists and pro-Syrian dissidents.
   He was said to be the mastermind of the Palestinian uprising in
the occupied territories and his death was a severe blow to the
PLO, underscoring Israel's military might.

<HEAD>Contras Threaten Talks Cutoff if Aid Not Delivered</HEAD>

   A Contra leader threatened Monday to end the
upcoming peace talks unless the Sandinistas immediately allow U.S.
humanitarian aid to reach the guerrillas, and a top Nicaraguan
official met secretly here with the rebels.
   Contra director Adolfo Calero said the truce arrangement reached
last month in Sapoa, Nicaragua, would be in danger if the
Sandinistas continue to block food and medical supplies to rebel
troops inside that Central American country.
   Calero also acknowledged Monday the contents of an April 10
internal Contra memo obtained by The Associated Press.
   His forces' position was ``difficult,'' Calero said, adding that
immediate delivery of food and humanitarian supplies must be the
first priority in the talks scheduled to begin Thursday in Managua.
   The internal memo writen by the Contra field officer known as
Cmdr. Johnson said ``we urgently need that humanitarian-type aid be
permitted to the troops, who are in a critical situation.''
   ``We must reach an agreement on that,'' said Calero. ``If that
is not done, the whole Sapoa agreement will collapse.''
   He said the Contras have three private U.S. companies available
to rush the supplies to Nicaragua as soon as the Sandinistas agree.
Some of the aid approved by Congress was already on its way to
refugee camps on the Honduran-Nicaraugan border, he added.
   And, in preparation for Thursday's top-level negotiations in
Nicaragua, Sandinista Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco arrived
secretly in Miami to discuss ``the agenda and arrangments'' for the
talks, Calero confirmed.
   Tinoco was to meet at an undisclosed location Monday with the
Contra directors' secretary, said Calero, but was not expected to
meet face-to-face with the five directors.
   Tinoco has previously accused the Contras of engaging in
political maneuvering to avoid a definitive cease-fire while they
receive U.S. aid.
   ``We have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive
cease-fire,'' Tinoco said in Nicaragua on April 13. ``They simply
want to move into zones which means gains for them without a
threat, with security and to gain the release of 50 percent of the
prisoners, American aid and participation in politics.''
   The plight of the troops has been said to be a contributing
cause to a reported rift among the Contra leaders, but Monday
Calero downplayed the differences among the five directors.
   He denied leading a movement to fire top military chief Enrique
Bermudez, but acknowledged two other rebel field comanders ``Tono''
and ``Fernando'' _ Walter Calderon and Diogenes Hernandez _ had
objected to the peace talks. He also said, when asked about a
Contra shakeup, that three top civilian employees of the rebel
troops had been replaced by military officials.
   He insisted, however, that there was still unity among the
directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally
called.
   All five directors, including Aristides Sanchez, who skipped the
last meeting with the Sandinistas in Managua for ``personal
reasons,'' will fly to Nicaragua for this week's negotiations,
Calero said.
   He denied infighting between himself and Sanchez, who some
sources say has the backing of Bermudez and many field commanders,
but acknowledged that tactical differences existed among the Contra
leaders, just as they did among the Sandinistas.

   A couple from Dayton, Ohio, have become
frequent visitors to Orlando, handing out fliers, asking questions
and checking people and places their missing musician son may have
known and visited.
   ``We keep hoping that we will find him alive but the longer it
goes, it makes us worry more that we won't,'' says Stanley Chism
about his missing son, Stanley Chism Jr., 23.
   Police found his bloodstained shirt, other clothes and a crowbar
covered with blood in a trash bin. His girlfriend's phone number
and a bank deposit slip were in the shirt pocket. Blood was found
on the back seat of his car.
   The younger Chism disappeared shortly after calling his parents
and girlfriend Feb. 5. His roommate and members of his gospel music
group reported him missing Feb. 8.
   On their first trip to Orlando, Chism and his wife Georgia went
to motels, shopping centers and other places to look for their
son's car. They handed out fliers with information about their son
and tried to contact anybody who had known him.
   The car was found after somebody read a newspaper advertisement
that the Chisms placed. In addition to the blood, Orange County
sheriff's deputies found Chism's glasses and boots in the car, his
father said. A sheriff's spokesman said samples of the blood were
being tested.
   ``Foul play could be involved, but right now we haven't found a
victim,'' said sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons. ``We are doing
everything we can. We are working this case diligently.''
   Chism's parents disagree.
   ``We feel that from the beginning, the police (sheriff's)
department has not shown a concern for a missing person,'' said the
elder Chism, an evangelist. ``That is the reason we have driven
miles and miles.''
   Solomons disputes the parents' claims. He said the sheriff's
office followed standard procedures in handling a missing person
report.
   Chism, who played piano in a gospel group known as Loretta
Carter and the Sounds of Praise, had planned to leave Orlando in
March and work with his father in a ministry.
   For his mother, the worst part is not knowing.
   ``It's like you can't grieve because you don't know that he is
dead and you can't go on because you can't find him,'' she said.

   The Supreme Court on Monday let stand an
Arizona telephone company's ban on sexually explicit dial-up
message services.
   In the first ``dial-a-porn'' case to reach the high court, the
justices without comment declined to hear arguments that Mountain
Bell's refusal to carry sexually explicit message services violates
free-speech rights.
   The court's action came a week after Congress sent to President
Reagan a bill that would ban all dial-a-porn services, which are
available to callers through ``976'' exchanges and AT&T's ``900''
long-distance lines.
   State governments also have been working to limit availability
of dial-a-porn services, and last week the Federal Communications
Commission fined two California dial-a-porn companies $600,000 each
for allegedly failing to prevent children from hearing their
messages.
   The Supreme Court's action ``clearly puts the ball in the phone
companies' court,'' said Bradley Keirnes, vice president of
Citizens for Decency Through Law Inc., a Phoenix, Ariz.-based
public interest law firm specializing in obscenity law.
   Keirnes said phone companies now have a green light to ``pull
the plug on dial-a-porn'' services without fear of violating the
companies' First Amendment rights.
   Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr., R-Va., who spearheaded the move in
the House to approve a dial-a-porn ban, said the court's action
bolsters his belief that such a ban will withstand a court test.
   ``It indicates the thinking of the court, which is that this
kind of speech is not protected by the First Amendment,'' he said.
   Mountain Bell, a US West company, was pleased with the decision,
but the parent company is not considering extending the Arizona ban
to the 13 other states in its territory, a spokesman said.
   In Arizona, dial-a-porn services ``were particularly harmful to
our reputation, so we felt that (a ban) was the most appropriate
action for Arizona. But there are different circumstances in
different states,'' said US West spokesman Blair Johnson.
   In its other states, US West is offering customers one-time,
free blocking of 976 services, establishing a separate prefix for
dial-a-porn services and is no longer billing or collecting for
these services.
   ``We think those will be effective and give parents a tool to
keep children from gaining access to these types of services,''
Johnson said.
   Pacific Bell spokeswoman Sandy Hale said her company ``will
review our position in light of the Supreme Court's action to see
if there are direct implications.''
   Other Bell companies and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. had
no comment on the Supreme Court action.
   Mountain Bell in 1985 banned from its 976 network all businesses
that ``provide adult entertainment messages with sexually oriented
content.''
   The policy was challenged by Carlin Communications Inc. and
Sapphire Communications Inc., as impeding their freedom of speech.
   Only the government or some agent of the government can violate
someone's constitutional rights, so the two companies argued that
Mountain Bell's policy represented a ``state action.''
   They said that because Mountain Bell is a heavily regulated
public utility that had been pressured by state authorities to pull
the plug on dial-a-porn services, the company's action amounted to
an action of the state.
   A federal trial judge ruled that Mountain Bell could not refuse
to carry the dial-a-porn messages. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed that ruling last year, saying Mountain Bell's
action did not amount to a ``state action.''
   New York attorney Lawrence Abelman, representing Carlin, did not
return a telephone call for comment. Sapphire is a subsidiary of
Carlin.
   A similar decision by another federal appeals court previously
enabled Southern Bell to rid its 976 networks of dial-a-porn
services in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.

<HEAD>Administration Eyes Return to Limited `Rules of Engagement' in
Gulf</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Restores dropped word, `how,' 2nd graf, While emphasizing</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   President Reagan's spokesman suggested Monday
that the administration wants to return U.S. forces in the Persian
Gulf to the limited rules of engagement that existed before last
week's shooting with Iran.
   While emphasizing that no decisions have been made on how
American naval power will be used in the wake of last Monday's
exchanges with Iran, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Everybody
acknowledges that we need to move back to some more limited set of
rules.''
   Fitzwater's statement buttressed remarks that Secretary of State
George P. Shultz made in Brussels, Belgium, where American
officials were consulting with NATO allies on Persian Gulf strategy
and other issues.
   ``We will not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the
Iranians,'' Shultz said in an interview on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show.
He said the question of what rules should govern U.S. military
activities in the gulf remained unresolved, saying ``that's the
kind of decision that the president makes.''
   The tone of the comments by Fitzwater and Shultz differed with
assessments provided late last week by other administration
officials. Those officials, who spoke on condition they not be
named, had said the administration decided to expand its policy to
allow U.S. warships to aid neutral merchant ships under attack.
   But those officials said the rules of engagement would not be
expanded far enough to allow a broad-based U.S. escort for
non-American-flagged vessels in the gulf.
   The talk of a change in policy came as a direct result of the
mining of a U.S. frigate and last Monday's extensive fighting
between Iranian and U.S. forces. At the same time, Adm. William
Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, confirmed over the
weekend that U.S. officials were considering using Coast Guard
vessels in the gulf.
   But on Monday, Fitzwater talked of the possibility of returning
U.S. forces to the limited rules of engagement that applied before
last Monday's clash: rules which provide for measured responses to
the laying of mines or other Iranian provocations.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, had voiced fear about an increasing Americanization of
the Iran-Iraq war, and there has been a move in Congress to revise
provisions of the War Powers Act that limit the ability of
lawmakers to act.
   Reagan consulted with congressional leaders in advance of the
military strikes he ordered a week ago, and he wrote a letter
calling ``the matter closed'' in the aftermath of the exchanges.
But the administration has taken the position that elements of the
War Powers Act are unconsitutional, and has refused to invoke a
provision that would give lawmakers a chance to vote within 60 days
on whether to keep U.S. troops in the region.
   The administration also is consulting members of Congress in
connection with a reassessment of the rules of engagement in the
gulf.
   While Fitzwater stressed that several options remain under study
in the gulf, he said ``right now the rules of engagement are
essentially the same as they were last week, reflecting the
emergency nature of the situation. But the question is, where do we
move back to? ... I can't discuss specifics.''
   Shultz told interviewers that ``as far as our rules of
engagement are concerned, what the right ones are for this stage of
the game in the gulf are being considered in Washington, and there
is a process of consultation going on, and I think it's premature
to describe them in any particular way.''
   Fitzwater said the rules of engagement were expanded a week ago
``to accommodate the military situation that was encountered''
after Navy forces bombarded two Iranian oil platforms in reprisal
for the mining of the USS Samuel B. Roberts the week before.
   ``You'll recall at that point that our ships were engaging
hostile forces in any number of areas,'' Fitzwater said. ``And we
now want to move back to our conservative set of rules. And so that
decision has to be made about where to move back to. ...
   ``The rules were changed to accommodate the military aggression
that was encountered that day,'' he said. ``Once that is no longer
the case, we want to move to something that would be more
sustainable in the long term.''
   The United States remains officially neutral in the 7{-year
Iran-Iraq war although it used U.S. warships to guard
American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers from attacks since last summer.

   Former Continental Illinois National Bank officer
John Lytle's luxurious lifestyle and mounting personal debts led
him to scheme with two Oklahoma men to defraud the bank,
prosecutors said Monday at his trial.
   ``By the summer of 1981, Lytle lived a lifestyle virtually fit
for a king, like the `lifestyle of the rich and famous,'''
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ted Helwig contended during closing
arguments.
   Lytle, Tulsa oil driller Jere Sturgis and William Patterson,
former head of oil and gas lending at the failed Penn Square Bank
of Oklahoma City, are charged with participating in a scheme to
defraud Continental.
   Lytle, a former Continental vice president, is accused of taking
kickbacks in exchange for funding and attempting to fund high-risk
energy loans from Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. to
Penn Square customers.
   The three men have pleaded innocent. Lytle, 52, and Patterson,
37, are charged with wire fraud and misapplication of bank funds.
Sturgis, 40, is charged with wire fraud.
   U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur is presiding over the trial,
which is into its sixth week.
   The indictment cites Lytle's involvement in $44 million in loans
made by Continental to 12 Penn Square customers. It does not say
how much was recovered by the Chicago bank, which came to the brink
of collapse in 1984 in part because of its troubled energy loans.
   Continental was rescued with a $4.5 billion federal bailout.
   Those loans were approved in 1981 and 1982 _ at about the same
time, Helwig charges, that Lytle received nearly $600,000 in
kickbacks from Patterson in the form of unsecured personal loans
from Penn Square.
   He said Lytle, a 20-year Continental veteran who oversaw the
bank's oil and gas lending in Oklahoma, needed the money because he
was living well beyond his means.
   ``He had a home he was doubling in size, vacations, two vacation
homes, and $565,000 (from the Penn Square Bank) that he used to buy
cars, furs, and jewelry.
   ``He had become so completely dependent on Bill Patterson, he no
longer had the interest of Continental first and foremost,'' Helwig
said.
   Lytle, impassive during government arguments, took notes. He sat
facing the jury, wearing a brown suit and scuffed penny loafers _
one with a hole in the sole.

<HEAD>Chicago Special Mayoral Election Now Could Be Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city board of elections voted Monday to hold
a special mayoral election next year if the city clerk declares a
vacancy in the mayor's office.
   Eugene Sawyer has been serving as acting mayor since last
November when then-Mayor Harold Washington, the city's first black
mayor, died after suffering a massive heart attack in his office.
   Sawyer was elected by the City Council, and his supporters
contend the next mayoral election should be in 1991, when
Washington's term would have expired.
   Under the three-member board's unanimous decision, City Clerk
Walter Kozubowski must decide whether a vacancy exists in the
mayor's office.
   Deputy City Clerk Daniel J. Burke said Kozubowski has not
decided what to do and would await an opinion from the city's
corporation counsel.
   Otis Chism, administrative assistant to the general counsel for
the Board of Elections Commission, said he was not sure what
prompted the decision.
   Supporters of Alderman Tim Evans, expected to be one of Sawyer's
chief mayoral challengers in the next election, have been seeking a
1989 election.
   Chism said the matter could end up being settled in court, where
two lawsuits are pending. One asks for a 1989 special election, and
the other seeks a 1991 vote.
   The board's vote today followed last week's decision by the
State Board of Elections to postpone until May 4 making any
recommendations on the question of when the city's next mayoral
election should be.
   Burke said that if an election is held, the city board agreed to
Feb. 28 as a primary election date in 1989 with April 4 as a
general election date.

   A former top aide has left Jimmy
Swaggart's church to start his own, but says he still loves
Swaggart and is not trying to compete with the defrocked
evangelist's ministry.
   ``We left friends. Brother Swaggart and I are still friends,''
said the Rev. Jerald Ogg after inaugural services at Bethel Temple
Assemblies of God Church on Sunday.
   Ogg, who set up Swaggart's foreign crusades and often served as
a ministry spokesman, said he still loves Jimmy Swaggart World
Ministries.
   ``I've always wanted to pioneer a church,'' said Ogg. ``I'm
getting that chance here, but it's going to take time.''
   The 80 worshipers at the first Bethel Temple service had to sing
from memory because there were no hymn books or church bulletins.
Ogg put three small advertisements in local newspapers announcing
Sunday's services, but said he is not trying to steal worshipers.
   ``We will do nothing unethical. We have not called anyone and
asked them to come,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, services at Swaggart's own Family Worship Center were
disrupted by a man who said God had sent him with a message:
Swaggart should return to the pulpit immediately.
   Swaggart is observing a three-month ban on preaching imposed by
Louisiana Assemblies of God leaders as part of the punishment for
his reported visit to a prostitute. Swaggart left the Assemblies of
God after the national church extended the ban to a year.
   ``Let him preach, man!'' shouted Herbert G. Hobbs of Savannah,
Ga.
   Ushers escorted Hobbs out. In an interview shortly afterward,
Hobbs said God told him to drive from Georgia to tell Swaggart
``that (God) wants him up on his feet and preaching now.''
   Swaggart laughed and remained seated next to his wife, Frances,
during the incident.
   At Bethel Temple, Ogg recalled the beginning of Swaggart's
church eight years ago.
   ``Some of you were there to start that church with me, too,'' he
told the fledgling congregation.
   ``This will be a wide-open church. We will have an advisory
panel for running the church,'' said Ogg, adding that the
congregation will vote on major decisions.
   Ogg will be the pastor of Bethel Temple, with his son Jeff as
co-pastor. Jeff Ogg was in charge of the ministry for single men
and women at the Family Worship Center.

<TEXT>
   By thee or not by thee? That was the question
which swirled around a poem that an Oxford University professor
said is by William Shakespeare but other scholars rejected as false.
   ``I'm convinced it is by Shakespeare,'' said Oxford's professor
of poetry, Peter Levi, as he held up a photocopy of the untitled
poem at the center of the tempest.
   Levi called a news conference Monday _ four days after his claim
emerged in a London newspaper _ to introduce a 28-page book he has
written to prove the poem was written by The Bard.
   Counters Professor Stanley Wells, director of the Shakespeare
Institute at Birmingham University: ``I do not think for one moment
it is by him.''
   The controversy had spread to the Huntington Library in San
Marino, Calif., which has the disputed poem. Some experts claim the
issue is not new _ that the poem has been known of since 1801 _ and
some say it's not up to Shakespearean standards.
   Levi has support from a manuscript scholar, Eric Sams, who says
the poem may even be in Shakespeare's handwriting.
   ``I don't terribly mind what happens to my reputation,'' said
Levi. ``It would be a terrible act of cowardice not to have printed
as a poem of Shakespeare what other people were too idle or too
silly to notice.''
   He said he first read the untitled poem when he asked the
Huntington Library for photocopies of several manuscripts for his
Shakespeare biography.
   The poem is pasted in the back of a manuscript volume containing
a play by John Marston, a dramatist contemporary of Shakespeare,
and bears initials that could be ``WSH'' or ``WSK.''
   ``I think it is `W. Sh.' Otherwise why would Marston have
written it?'' Levi said.
   ``Without that signature I would not have been absolutely
certain, but no one disputes that the writing is Marston's and I
believe he was appending the initials of the poem's author.''
   Asked why the poem had been neglected since Shakespeare died in
1616, Levi commented: ``I can't imagine. The verses have movement
like the end of `The Tempest.' They recall `As You Like It' and
`Antony and Cleopatra.'
   ``They are exactly what Shakespeare might have turned out,''
said Levi, 56, who has published 12 books of his own poems and
written or edited 25 others.
   The poem consists of tributes to be spoken by 14 identified
ladies presenting gifts to Anne Chandos at her betrothal party in
1607.
   Levi cited this verse to prove the poem was worthy of England's
greatest poet:
   ``Witty, pretty, virtuous and fair,
   ``Compounded all of fire and air,
   ``Sweet, measure not my thought and me
   ``By golden fruit from fruitless tree.''
   ``That's beautiful. It could be Shakespeare and I think the
whole thing is by him,'' the professor said.
   Levi said he worked from photocopies of the poem ``because I
cannot afford to jump on a plane to California. I am poorly paid.''
   Lord Stockton, chairman of Macmillan publishers, handed
reporters copies of Levi's book about the poem, ``A Private
Commission: New Verses by Shakespeare.''
   ``I regard this as the literary event of the decade and perhaps
of the whole period since World War II,'' Stockton said.
   A.L. Rowse, a renowned Elizabethan scholar, wrote in London's
Evening Standard newspaper Monday that the Levi verses were ``quite
good _ but they are simple and direct,'' and lack Shakespeare's
elusiveness and imagery.
   James Knowles, an Oxford research student who independently
investigated the poem's authenticity, said he doesn't believe
Shakespeare wrote it and he will publish his views Friday.
   ``I am not merely indulging in scholarly skepticism when I say I
do not think the verse is Shakespeare's,'' said Birmingham's Wells.
``I do not think Levi made anything of a case because he seems to
be saying that because it is good, it must be Shakespeare's. That
is a subjective judgment.
   ``There were masses of other poets capable of writing good
poetry and there were other poets whose initials were WS,'' he said
in an interview.
   Sara Hodson, a curator at the Huntington, said the undated
Marston book and the inserted poem were dated to the 17th century
by the paper, ink, handwriting and binding.
   ``It has been in the library since 1917 ... At least one other
scholar and probably more have wondered about the Shakespeare
connection,'' she said.

   A judge sentenced John Demjanjuk on Monday to
die for Nazi war crimes and said the retired Ohio autoworker
personally killed tens of thousands of people as the sadistic death
camp guard ``Ivan the Terrible.''
   Hundreds of spectators jumped to their feet and applauded. Some
shouted ``Bravo!'' and others ``Death! Death!'' Survivors of the
Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed, cried and embraced
each other.
   Judge Zvi Tal said Demjanjuk's crimes at the Treblinka death
camp in Nazi-occupied Poland could ``never be forgiven by the
hearts of men or be obliterated from memory. ... The blood of the
victims still cries out to us.''
   ``Ivan the Terrible'' operated the gas chambers at Treblinka,
where 850,000 Jews were killed in 1942-43. Demjanjuk was convicted
last week.
   The judge, who was born in Poland and lost his parents in the
Holocaust, said Demjanjuk ``served as an arch henchman who with his
own hands killed tens of thousands of human beings. He humiliated
and degraded his victims.''
   Minutes before the sentence was read, Demjanjuk shouted in
Hebrew: ``I'm an innocent man!''
   Demjanjuk, 68, was in a wheelchair because of back problems. He
is a Ukrainian Orthodox Christian and crossed himself repeatedly
and muttered, apparently in prayer.
   The 14-month trial in a converted movie theater was only the
second in Israel of someone charged with Nazi crimes. More than
250,000 people attended and sessions were broadcast live on radio
and television.
   Adolf Eichmann, who directed Adolf Hitler's program for
exterminating Jews, was tried in Israel and hanged in 1962. He is
the only person to have been executed in Israel since it bedcame a
nation in 1948.
   Court spokesman Yossi Hassin said Demjanjuk also probably would
be executed by hanging ``if the sentence is upheld on appeal.''
   John Demjanjuk Jr., the defendant's 22-year-old son, sobbed
silently. He said the family had expected a death sentence and
would appeal within days.
   ``This amounts to nothing more than the judicial murder of an
innocent man,'' he said.
   ``It will bring shame to the state of Israel, the Israeli
Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department and most
unfortunately the 6 million victims of the Nazi Holocaust,'' he
said. The United State extradited Demjanjuk to Israel.
   In Lorain, Ohio, the Rev. John Bruchok of St. Mary's Ukrainian
Orthodox Church said: ``It's a travesty of justice.'' Bruchok met
the defendant when the family asked for a priest shortly before
Demjanjuk was sent to Israel.
   ``I saw his face,'' Bruchok said. ``I saw the face of a gentle
man who was scared. An innocent man is being executed. I believe
this with all my heart. It is very unfortunate.''
   Josef Czarny, a Treblinka survivor who testified for the
prosecution, said: ``A thousand deaths cannot compensate for what
happened ... but at least we have judged one of the angels of
death.''
   Pinchas Epstein, another survivor who testified, hugged a
relative and said: ``I feel like a burden was lifted.''
   Earlier in the day, Demjanjuk told the court in a calm, clear
voice: ``You have made a grave mistake. ... I do not deserve this.
I am innocent, innocent, innocent. God is my witness.''
   ``In the 20th century how is it possible for such an injustice
to be done?'' he asked in Ukrainian. ``I am not Ivan the Terrible,
and to that God is the most just witness. He knows I am innocent.''
   Prosecutor Yonah Blattman said in his argument for the death
penalty that Demjanjuk ``was not a small cog in the Nazi machine,
he was a major criminal.''
   Demjanjuk pointed to his chest and repeatedly shook his head to
Blattman's allegations that he ``distinguished himself by the sheer
brutality of his behavior. ... He cut off breasts, slashed faces,
beat in skulls.''
   He crossed himself each time Blattman mentioned an atrocity,
causing murmurs among the 650 spectators.
   Defense lawyer John Gill of Cleveland said new evidence might
come to light that would prove his client innocent, and cited cases
of wrongful conviction.
   ``The death penalty is an irrevocable penalty imposed by
fallible judges. ``Let not a second crime happen. ... The taking of
any innocent human life is a Holocaust,'' he said, and there were
gasps from the audience.
   After the sentencing, ashen-faced, Demjanjuk was ringed by
police guards and wheeled from the courtroom.
   He shouted to reporters before reaching a police van: ``I'm an
innocent man!! I'm not `Ivan the Terrible'! I don't care what they
(the court) did!''
   Demjanjuk bumped his head as guards lifted him into the van. He
could be seen slumped in the wheelchair as the vehicle drove past
jeering spectators.

<HEAD>White House Regrets Gorbachev's Reaction to Reagan Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said Monday it regretted that
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has taken strong exception to
President Reagan's ``accurate'' and ``realistic'' assessment of
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged that
Reagan's comments, contained in a speech delivered Thursday in
Springfield, Mass., had irritated the Soviet leader in advance of
the May 29-June 3 Moscow summit.
   According to a report by the Soviet news agency Tass, Gorbachev
complained to Secretary of State George P. Shultz about the
president's speech during a meeting last week in Moscow.
   Gorbachev took Reagan to task for criticizing Soviet policy in
Afghanistan and on human rights, the report said.
   In his speech, the president questioned whether the Soviets had
abandoned ``ambitions'' to control Afghanistan and threaten
Pakistan, despite the recent Geneva accord outlining the Soviet
pullout. He also said the Soviets could ``never have truly normal
relations'' with the United States as long as it violated human
rights.
   ``President Reagan's comments on East-West relations in his
Springfield, Mass., speech obviously struck a raw nerve with the
general secretary,'' Fitzwater said when asked about Gorbachev's
comments.
   ``The very harsh rhetoric used by Tass to describe the
president's speech is most unfortunate. We trust it does not signal
a move away from the steadily improving relations that the Soviet
Union has espoused in its recent past,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman contended that Reagan's comments signaled no
change in U.S. policy and defended the speech as ``accurate in
terms of the way we view Soviet intentions'' in countries such as
Afghanistan, Nicaragua and Ethiopia.
   Fitzwater said there have been ``significant improvements'' in
U.S.-Soviet relations in recent years, particularly in the area of
arms control, but he added that Reagan ``will continue to be
realistic, ... will continue to point out problems as well as
positive developments.''
   Asked by reporters why it had been appropriate for Reagan to use
tough language in describing Soviet actions, but not for Gorbachev
to do the same, Fitzwater said, ``It seemed needlessly
inflammatory.''
   But at another point, the spokesman said the Soviets ``have a
right to say anything they want.''
   Asked if the administration was pleased it had ``struck a raw
nerve'' with Reagan's speech, Fitzwater replied, ``I don't regret
that it struck a nerve, but I regret that it has caused this kind
of personal feelings and trading of harsh language.''
   The spokesman said Reagan ``wants to be realistic in terms of
our relations, especially as we approach a fourth summit.
   ``As the president said in his speech, a major test of Soviet
intentions is how they conduct their regional political affairs,
and he's simply saying that's going to be a part of our
discussion,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said it was Reagan's intention to ``point out the major
issues that divide us, and that two superpowers need to discuss
openly and frankly at summits.
   ``We think its a healthy sign that both countries are willing to
face up to the realities of their problems in a summit
atmosphere,'' Fitzwater added.
   Asked if the situation might put a strain on the upcoming summit
between Reagan and Gorbachev, he said, ``I hope not. You just never
know.''

<TEXT>
   Seven days a week when it's sunny, Henry
Hasselhan sits alone in a closet-sized room 100 feet in the air and
stares into space.
   But if a puff of smoke appears, the fire tower observer must
quickly spot it, plot its location with help from another tower and
report in by short-wave radio.
   And in the heart of forest fire season, Hasselhan may do that
several times a day.
   From March 15 to May 15, when humidity is low and leaves have
not yet covered bare trees to provide shade, the warming sun may
spontaneously ignite the dry forest floor, said Ben Petrini, an
assistant warden with the state Division of Parks, Forestry and
Recreation.
   Hasselhan's job may seem monotonous, but his window-lined
``office'' has one of the finest views in all of southern New
Jersey. It also sways in the wind.
   ``Sometimes it gets boring, sometimes it gets very busy,'' the
33-year-old Atco resident said. ``A lot of times you just sit here.
On rainy days, you either go home or down to the shop to help work
on the fire trucks.''
   Tower watchers put in lighter hours during the summer, then go
back to the seven-day-a-week routine for about a month in autumn
when leaves fall and dry out. They spend the winter in the forestry
department shop building new fire trucks from the frame up. The job
pays $14,000 to $20,000 a year.
   The curious sometimes ask to visit the towers, and Hasselhan
never stops them.
   ``A lot of them reach the third flight and can't make it because
they get scared of the height,'' he said.
   At 9:45 a.m. each day, Hasselhan checks the weather gauges at
the foot of the tower. Then, after catching his breath from the
long climb up the staircase, he checks in with Petrini in the
Division C office in Mays Landing.
   Division C covers still-forested sections of southern New Jersey
including the Pinelands and has six towers, built in the 1930s,
scanning a total of roughly 100,000 acres, Petrini said. Division A
handles the northwestern corner of the state, and Division B has
towers covering forests in the middle of the state.
   As of Monday, more than 257 fires, most of them minor, have been
doused in Division C, covering the state's six southern-most
counties.
   A sheet on the tower's wall lists nearby industries and power
plants that emit smoke. Hasselhan points to a white cloud in the
distance and explains it is from an asphalt plant.
   ``I know the difference after sitting up here all this time,''
he said. ``You know what smoke looks like. A house fire doesn't
move and looks black. A woods fire changes color and changes
direction.''
   When Hasselhan spots smoke, he immediately calls another tower
to confirm it. They then locate the smoke with a surveying device
and call the warden, who sends out a firefighting team.
   Hasselhan has been a fire tower observer for almost four years.
The novelty of having a ``terrific view'' wore off quickly, he said.
   But the tower is just a preliminary stop in his career.
   ``I'd rather be out fighting fires,'' he said.

   A paint store erupted in flames with a pair of
explosions, forcing panicked residents to jump from upstairs
apartment windows into the arms of bystanders as firefighters
fought to control the blaze early Monday.
   A dozen people were injured in the fire that destroyed the store
building and badly damaged three other buildings, but only one was
admitted to a hospital.
   However, the blaze was so intense that rescuers initially were
convinced there would be fatalities and the Fire Department ordered
25 body bags sent to the scene.
   ``People that were in the building, some of them on the third
floor, they said they felt the building drop,'' said Deputy Fire
Chief William Walker. ``The north wall dropped out and they jumped
to their safety. And nobody was seriously injured that I know of.''
   ``It was very fortunate,'' he said. ``They must have had a
friend upstairs.''
   The fire began with an explosion at the paint store at 11:13
p.m. Sunday, fire officials said. Within minutes after the first
firefighters arrived, a second, more powerful explosion ripped
through the paint store, blowing out one wall and creating a
fireball that rapidly spread to nearby structures.
   Cheryl McMurray, 33, and Joe Bell, 44, were sitting at a dining
table in a third-floor apartment above the store.
   ``The floor went right out beneath us,'' Ms. McMurray said.
``Everything in the kitchen was shaking. He (Bell) had me by the
hand and pulled me down the stairs. It took us 20 seconds to get
out the front door, but the smoke was really intense.
   ``By the time we got to the second floor it was really hot. As
soon as we got outside, it went poof. It just went poof.''
   Caroline Boatman, who was at a bar a block and a half away, said
several bar patrons left with her and began shouting outside to
awaken people in the neighborhood. She said several people joined
together to catch residents who jumped from windows when the
building began collapsing.
   ``I opened the window and some people were shouting to me. I
just jumped and they caught me,'' said David Bedwell, 24, who
jumped from the second flood in his underwear.
   ``There was no fire yet, but then David (Bedwell) jumped out
.... and others saw him and began jumping too,'' Ms. Boatman said.
   It took five hours for 165 firefighters using 30 pieces of
equipment to bring the fire under control. Authorities predicted it
would be some time before investigators determined the cause.
   The only person hospitalized was Jae Ahn, 31, listed in fair
condition with a spinal injury she suffered when she jumped from
her second-story apartment.
   ``The floor exploded, and at the same time the ceiling collapsed
down,'' said her husband, Young Ahn, a foreign exchange student at
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
   Ahn lowered himself out a window using an electrical cord, but
it broke and he fell to the ground. His wife then jumped holding
the couple's 23-month-old daughter in her arms. The child suffered
only scrapes to the face.
   Aside from destroying the paint store and the apartments above
it, the fire also damaged a duplex next door, and two taverns.
   Twenty-eight people were left homeless, and all received
assistance from the Milwaukee chapter of the American Red Cross.

   A $10,000 bond couldn't hold a man who
has since been accused of 194 counts of burglary, so a judge has
multiplied the defendant's bond by 1,000 _ to $10 million.
   Judge Mike McDonald said he did not realize Dwight Christopher
had a record of past burglary convictions and had other charges
pending when he set his bond at $10,000 on March 4 after he was
booked with a count of burglary.
   ``He bonded out within an hour and a defense attorney caught him
coming out the window of a house the next day,'' McDonald said
Sunday.
   Christopher, 35, of Baton Rouge, was arrested again on March 16
and an investigation led to all the charges of committing 194
burglaries since July 1987 to support an alleged $300- to
$500-per-day cocaine habit, said police Officer Jeff Wesley.
   After learning that Christopher had a five-page rap sheet,
McDonald ordered him held without bond Friday, but was told he
couldn't legally do that.
   ``I believe that Mr. Christopher is a threat to society, and I
believe that I can hold him without bond, but just to be safe I
placed a $10 million bond on him,'' McDonald said.
   Christopher was released from the Louisiana State Penitentiary
last year after serving nine years of a 30-year sentence for
burglary.
   In addition to the burglary charges, Christopher is being held
on counts of second-degree battery, auto theft and resisting an
officer, booking records show.

Cancers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 48-30 approval Monday of a
bill granting new benefits to an estimated 250,000 ``atomic
veterans'' who were exposed to radiation during the U.S. nuclear
attacks on Japan in 1945 and in post-war nuclear tests.
   The bill still requires House approval, but the measure faces a
veto threat from President Reagan if it reaches his desk.
   ``It is time to be fair to these men,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee and chief
sponsor of the bill.
   The measure would cost an estimated $36 million in its first
year to pay for medical treatments.
   The atomic veterans are service personnel who either took part
in the occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after U.S. atomic bombs
were dropped on those Japanese cities in August 1945, or who took
part in open-air tests of American atomic weapons in the Pacific or
Nevada during the two decades after the war.
   Many of those veterans have developed cancer and have urged the
Veterans Administration to make a presumptive finding that their
cancers are related to their exposure to radiation during the
tests. Many of the servicemen were exposed to radiation during the
tests with little or no protective clothing.
   The bill would include 13 specific types of cancer.
   Under existing law, veterans with cancer can receive
compensation, but in each case, they must show that the illness is
service-related.
   Only 28 of the nearly 5,000 veterans who have filed
radiation-related claims with the VA have been approved for
disability benefits.
   Originally, the bill passed Monday was part of a larger health
and compensation bill for the nation's 27.4 million veterans.
   But the ``atomic veterans'' measure was so strongly opposed by
the Reagan administration that it was dropped because of a veto
threat issued by the White House.
   Administration officials argue there is no scientific basis for
presuming that the 13 types of cancers were caused by exposure to
radiation during military service.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said the bill ``just ignores sound,
medical scientific evidence. ... It's just an absurd approach
toward compensation.

   The House passed and sent to President Reagan
on Monday a bill providing for the prompt return of children
abducted from a parent and taken to another country, often by the
other parent.
   The measure, approved by voice vote, would implement an
international treaty on child abduction that the United States
signed in 1981 and the Senate approved five years later.
   The House, which had passed an almost identical bill March 28,
approved on Monday a slightly different Senate version giving
jurisdiction over international child abduction cases to both state
and federal courts.
   The measure is intended to remove difficult, time-consuming
legal issues involved in returning children abducted to another
country, or helping foreign parents recover children wrongfully
taken to the United States.

<HEAD>Chirac Rallies Forces, Refuses To Negotiate With Far Right</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Jacques Chirac, desperate for votes in the
election runoff against President Francois Mitterrand, rallied
conservative forces Monday but still refused to deal with the
extreme-right National Front.
   Nearly all political analysis focused on Chirac's need to
attract supporters from National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen,
who won a stunning 14.4 percent of the vote in Sunday's first-round.
   The premier, head of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic
party, garnered only 19.9 percent of the vote. He was far behind
the president who led all challengers with 34 percent.
   Mitterand, a Socialist, is heavily favored to win a second
seven-year term in the May 8 runoff.
   The Chirac campaign announced a televised debate between the
premier and the 71-year-old Mitterrand had been scheduled for
Thursday, an encounter they believe can only help Chirac.
   By Monday afternoon, 99 percent of the vote had been counted,
lacking only returns from French Polynesia.
   Former center-right Premier Raymond Barre, 64, who finished
third with 16.6 percent, immediately threw his support behind
Chirac, 55, and called on his voters to do the same.
   On Monday, the centrist Union for French Democracy, which had
backed Barre, also gave Chirac its endorsement.
   It was not clear, however, how many of Barre supporters would
actually vote for Chirac. Polls indicate a significant number could
cross over to Mitterrand, who has moved markedly to the center
since becoming president in 1981.
   Le Pen, 59, whose campaign focused on curbing immigration and
crime, said he would wait until a major National Front rally May 1
to announce what counsel he would give his voters.
   If Chirac wants his votes, Le Pen said, he will have to announce
``concrete acts in the area of housing, in the area of subsidies to
immigrants ... and also in the area of family allocations.''
   One of the National Front's main arguments is that immigrants
are taking French jobs, overburdening the French welfare system and
making less money available to help needy French citizens.
   ``It is up to Jacques Chirac ... to define what electoral
majority is possible for him,'' Le Pen said. ``Then we will see if
that jibes with what we feel it should be.''
   Le Pen said the vote of his supporters depended on their
individual choice, but he added: ``It is certain that if I give a
warm counsel, it has a good chance of being widely followed.''
   Chirac called a meeting of his Cabinet on Monday and told them:
``It goes without saying that no negotiation will be held with
anybody.''
   Nonetheless, the subject of immigration is popping up with
increasing frequency in the remarks of both Chirac and his aides.
   ``He (Chirac) already has taken on Le Pen's themes and ideas,''
said Socialist Party spokesman Jean-Jack Queyranne. ``Will he also
take the men and allow them ministerial portfolios?''
   Chirac noted that Sunday's voting carried a message: ``It is up
to the (conservative) candidate to respond to the preoccupations of
the French people, to their expectations, to their hopes such as
they have been expressed (by the vote).''
   Alain Juppe, budget minister and spokesman for the Chirac
campaign, said the National Front performance was a message that
was based on three or four ideas.
   ``The first is that immigration is a problem of French society
today and that we perhaps have not done enough in this area and
that we must tackle the problem with respect to our values and our
convictions,'' he said.
   Juppe said Chirac must ``rally a wide range of the French to
avoid a new period of Socialism, of laxness and undoubted decline
and political troubles for France.''
   Francois Leotard, Chirac's culture minister, said the National
Front has indicated that ``things that are totally unacceptable for
the immense majority of French, and things which can be discussed.''
   ``Let us try to make the distinction between all of that, but
without negotiating anything whatever with anybody. Xenophobia and
racism are not for us.''
   Lionel Jospin, first secretary of the Socialist Party, said the
voters had shown Sunday that ``Chirac does not inspire confidence.
They don't think that he can be president.''

<HEAD>Shultz Tells Denmark To Meet Responsibilities Under NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on
Monday urged Denmark to ``measure up'' to its NATO responsibilities
and to stop a resolution that would effectively ban allied ships
from Danish ports.
   Shultz met with Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen to
restate U.S. concerns about a Danish Parliament motion which
demands that visiting warships not carry nuclear arms into Danish
harbors.
   ``It constitutes a real problem,'' Shultz said of the April 14
motion.
   Denmark's minority center-right government opposed the measure
and has called for early elections May 10.
   ``If you like the benefits (of NATO membership) ... then you
ought to like the responsibilities that go with making that
possible,'' Shultz said.
   He met with Ellemann-Jensen after briefing NATO foreign
ministers on his talks last week in Moscow with Soviet leaders.
   The talks were held to prepare for the May 29-June 2 summit
meeting between President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. Shultz said prospects for a treaty by then to halve U.S.
and Soviet strategic nuclear arms were dim.
   ``It's extremely difficult to get there. There are hard issues
to get at. They involve a lot of pick-and-shovel work,'' he said.
   The issues deal with verification of compliance and counting
different arms systems under a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
Shultz told reporters at NATO headquarters.
   He said he would continue negotiating after the summit in the
last months of the Reagan administration.
   ``We'll keep at it, we're not going to stop,'' he said, citing
``broad bipartisan support'' for a START accord in the United
States.
   He denied superpower relations had slumped since last year's
signing of a treaty to remove hundreds of medium-range nuclear
missiles from Europe.
   Citing Moscow's decision to withdraw its troops from
Afghanistan, Shultz said, ``I think the picture is one in which we
see general progress.''
   Ellemann-Jensen said his government was looking to the May 10
elections for an answer to the NATO problem.
   ``We want to get a clear message from our voters that they want
Denmark to remain a full member of the alliance,'' he said. ``If we
get the signal from the voters we are asking for it will be
possible to reach a fair solution.''
   That means Denmark would stick by its current ban on nuclear
arms on its soil but would not demand a declaration from visiting
ships, he said.
   U.S. and British warships, as a matter of policy, never say if
their warships carry nuclear arms. The Danish resolution has led
Britain to suspend visits to Denmark by Royal Navy vessels.
   Ellemann-Jensen said, ``Both the Americans and the British have
made it clear many times it would be necessary to discuss the full
participation of Denmark in military matters if we'' effectively
banned allied warships from these two countries.
   Shultz said the parliamentary resolution, while an internal
Danish matter, has NATO-wide implications. Norway also formally
bans nuclear arms from its territory and there have been calls
there for a motion similar to the one in Denmark.
   Denmark bans the basing of allied troops on its soil in
peacetime, relying on the United States and Britain to reinforce
its territory in times of crisis.
   Shultz said NATO membership yields benefits but ``it also
entails responsibilities. The two things go together and it is up
to all of us to measure up as best as we can to our
responsibilities.''

   The manufacturer of baby swings that could
collapse is offering free replacements, the Consumer Product Safety
Commission announced Monday.
   Involved are 6,562 wooden baby swings sold under the Sears and
Hedstrom brand names. They were manufactured by Hedstrom Corp. of
Bedford, Pa., between April and December 1987, the commission said.
   According to the agency, four incidents have been reported in
which the swings collapsed because the glue failed to hold the
joints between the slats and frame.
   The models being replaced are Hedstrom brand 4-798 and Sears
brand 512.70907, the commission said.
   Consumers should stop using the swing and return it to the place
of purchase for replacement. Those needing more information can
call Hedstrom at 1-800-242-9034. Pennsylvania residents should call
1-800-233-3271.
   The safety commission can be reached at 1-800-638-2772.

<HEAD>Study: Acid Rain Contributing To Death Of Marine Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acid rain's ``sewage from the sky'' is an
important and unrecognized contributor to the death of marine life
in East Coast estuaries and coastal waters, an environmental group
said Monday.
   Nitrate compounds originating in the atmosphere, mostly as
nitric acid, appear to contribute about 25 percent of total
nitrogen flowing into Chesapeake Bay, said the Environmental
Defense Fund in a report by staff scientists.
   Ammonium compounds from the atmosphere, mostly originating in
the evaporation of manure, contribute another 14 percent of the
bay's nitrogen load, the report said.
   The damage comes not from the acidity, which is immediately
neutralized by salt water, but from the overload of nutrients
provided by nitrates and ammonium. These fertilizers encourage
``blooms'' of algae that use up oxygen dissolved in the water,
making it difficult for other plants and fish to live, and cut off
light necessary for bottom-anchored plants to grow.
   By contrast, the fund estimated the nitrogen contribution from
fertilizer runoff at 34 percent, municipal and industrial
discharges at 23 percent and direct runoff from animal waste at 4
percent.
   Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist on the fund staff
and one of the study's authors, said, ``This should change forever
our view of the acid rain problem,'' showing that ``sewage from the
sky'' in the form of nitrogen compounds are a major pollutant of
inshore waters.
   Although the fund's scientists concentrated on Chesapeake Bay,
they said there was evidence these airborne compounds also are
contributing to problems in Delaware Bay, Albemarle-Pamlico Sound
in North Carolina, Long Island Sound between New York and
Connecticut and the New York Bight in the Atlantic Ocean off New
York and New Jersey.
   Nationwide, a little more than 21 million tons of nitrogen
oxides are emitted from all sources, about one third from motor
vehicle exhausts, one third from power plant smokestacks and one
seventh from industrial boilers.
   The fund said it had provided the first estimate of how much of
the nitrogen flowing into the bay originates in the atmosphere,
both as runoff into streams and as direct precipitation on the
bay's surface.
   The fund's estimate of 154,000 tons of nitrogen compounds
flowing into the bay from all sources was higher than the 110,000
estimated by the federal-state Chesapeake Bay pollution control
program for an average year, but within the range of that program's
estimates of 92,000 tons for a dry year to 198,000 tons for a wet
year.
   The joint program has set a goal of reducing nitrogen loading on
the bay by 40 percent, and the fund's report said a 40 percent
reduction should be aimed for in airborne nitrogen.
   Oppenheimer called for enactment of one of the acid rain control
bills pending before Congress, saying, ``With the exception of new
auto controls, the states on the Atlantic Seaboard can begin this
program on their own, but they cannot finish it. ... A strong
federal role is absolutely necessary.''
   Bob Beck, environment manager of the Edison Electric Institute,
the major trade association of private utilities, said nitrogen
oxides from his industry were declining.
   Chris Rice, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency,
said EPA had not had a chance to study the fund's report and thus
could not comment immediately.
   The report kicks off three days of rallies, press conferences
and other events by environmental groups seeking an acid rain
control program that the Reagan administration opposes on the
grounds that not enough is known to justify it. The activity is
timed to coincide with the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney, who also is seeking a U.S. program because half the acid
rain falling in Canada originates in the United States.

<HEAD>Two Blacks Convicted Of Murder In 1985 Land Mine Blasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two alleged African National
Congress guerrillas were convicted of murder Monday in connection
with land mine explosions that killed seven people in 1985.
   One of the defendants, Mzondileli Nondula, was found guilty of
planting a mine that killed two white woman and four white children
as they drove in a pickup truck near the Zimbabwe border in
December 1985.
   His co-defendant, Mthetheleli Mncube, was convicted of laying a
mine that killed a black farm worker in the same area in November
1985. Mncube also was convicted of murdering two white policemen
while trying to escape following his arrest in 1986.
   Both defendants pleaded innocent. Defense lawyers are scheduled
to present arguments Tuesday in an effort to avoid death sentences
for the pair.
   Evidence presented during a six-month trial in the northern town
of Messina indicated that both men received military training at
ANC facilities in Angola, Tanzania and Zambia.
   The ANC, outlawed in South Africa, has waged a bombing and
sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending white-minority rule.
   Mncube described himself during the trial as ``an ANC soldier,''
but both he and Nondula said they were tortured by police before
signing confessions. In a separate development Monday, the
state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. reported that a black
policeman was shot dead by an unknown assailant near Newcastle in
northern Natal province.
   The broadcasting company said investigators found cartridges at
the scene from a Soviet-made AK-47 automatic rifle _ a weapon which
authorities say is used by ANC guerrillas.
   Black policemen have been frequent targets of militants who
consider them collaborators with the white-led government.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Laos Agrees to Excavate Crash Site for Missing U.S. Pilots</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laos is conducting a joint excavation with the
United States at a site where an American plane is believed to have
crashed during the Vietnam war, the State Department announced
Monday.
   U.S. and Lao officials have been surveying the site in recent
days, and the full American excavation team is expected in Laos
later this week, according to the statement. The digging will take
seven to 10 days.
   This is the third joint excavation as part of U.S. attempts to
account for 555 servicemen missing in Laos for over 15 years. The
two previous ones took place in February 1985 and February 1986,
and a number of remains were retrieved.
   Laos' communist government agreed last August to resume efforts
to account for MIAs after apparently suspending them since the 1986
excavation. In return, the United States has pledged to respond to
Laos' calls for humanitarian assistance.
   ``The United States government appreciates this further step by
the Lao government in our cooperative effort to resolve the issue
of Americans sitll missing or otherwise unaccounted for in Laos as
a result of the war,'' the State Department said.
   Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said she did not know
where the current excavation would take place. The previous two
were in Savannakhet and Saravane provinces, Laos' southern
panhandle area between Thailand and Vietnam.
   Many of the MIAs in Laos were airmen shot down on missions
against the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which North Vietnamese communist
forces used to ferry men and supplies to South Vietnam.
   There are 2,411 American servicemen still unaccounted for in all
of Southeast Asia, according to the Defense Department.

<HEAD>Contras Threaten Talks Cutoff if Aid Not Delivered</HEAD>

   A Contra leader threatened Monday to end the
upcoming peace talks unless the Sandinistas immediately allow U.S.
humanitarian aid to reach the guerrillas, and a top Nicaraguan
official met secretly here with the rebels.
   Contra director Adolfo Calero said the truce arrangement reached
last month in Sapoa, Nicaragua, would be in danger if the
Sandinistas continue to block food and medical supplies to rebel
troops inside that Central American country.
   Calero also acknowledged Monday the contents of an April 10
internal Contra memo obtained by The Associated Press.
   His forces' position was ``difficult,'' Calero said, adding that
immediate delivery of food and humanitarian supplies must be the
first priority in the talks scheduled to begin Thursday in Managua.
   The internal memo writen by the Contra field officer known as
Cmdr. Johnson said ``we urgently need that humanitarian-type aid be
permitted to the troops, who are in a critical situation.''
   ``We must reach an agreement on that,'' said Calero. ``If that
is not done, the whole Sapoa agreement will collapse.''
   He said the Contras have three private U.S. companies available
to rush the supplies to Nicaragua as soon as the Sandinistas agree.
Some of the aid approved by Congress was already on its way to
refugee camps on the Honduran-Nicaraugan border, he added.
   And, in preparation for Thursday's top-level negotiations in
Nicaragua, Sandinista Deputy Foreign Minister Victor Tinoco arrived
secretly in Miami to discuss ``the agenda and arrangments'' for the
talks, Calero confirmed.
   Tinoco was to meet at an undisclosed location Monday with the
Contra directors' secretary, said Calero, but was not expected to
meet face-to-face with the five directors.
   Tinoco has previously accused the Contras of engaging in
political maneuvering to avoid a definitive cease-fire while they
receive U.S. aid.
   ``We have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive
cease-fire,'' Tinoco said in Nicaragua on April 13. ``They simply
want to move into zones which means gains for them without a
threat, with security and to gain the release of 50 percent of the
prisoners, American aid and participation in politics.''
   The plight of the troops has been said to be a contributing
cause to a reported rift among the Contra leaders, but Monday
Calero downplayed the differences among the five directors.
   He denied leading a movement to fire top military chief Enrique
Bermudez, but acknowledged two other rebel field comanders ``Tono''
and ``Fernando'' _ Walter Calderon and Diogenes Hernandez _ had
objected to the peace talks. He also said, when asked about a
Contra shakeup, that three top civilian employees of the rebel
troops had been replaced by military officials.
   He insisted, however, that there was still unity among the
directors of the Nicaraguan Resistance, as the Contras are formally
called.
   All five directors, including Aristides Sanchez, who skipped the
last meeting with the Sandinistas in Managua for ``personal
reasons,'' will fly to Nicaragua for this week's negotiations,
Calero said.
   He denied infighting between himself and Sanchez, who some
sources say has the backing of Bermudez and many field commanders,
but acknowledged that tactical differences existed among the Contra
leaders, just as they did among the Sandinistas.

   Part of the original Berlin Wall collapsed into
the French section of West Berlin, police said Monday.
   Police said the 52-foot section of the wall that forms the
boundry between communist East Berlin and West Berlin fell into the
western Reinickendorf district, which is under French military
control.
   East Germany had already built a new, 13-foot-high wall of
reinforced concrete behind the crumbling brick barrier, West Berlin
police said.
   East Germany began construction of the 104-mile barrier in 1961.
It encircles the enclave city of West Berlin, 110 miles inside East
German territory.
   Most of the original barriers built to prevent East Germans from
fleeing to the West have been replaced by new concrete walls and
steel fences.
   The former German capital is jointly administered by Britain,
France, the United States and the Soviet Union, the four victorious
World War II powers.

<HEAD>Lyng Decries EEC Intransigence Over Farm Subsidies Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community has to get
serious about seeking solutions to ``an increasingly chaotic
condition'' in global agricultural trade or risk being blamed by
other trading countries, Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng said
Monday.
   But the EEC ``is unwilling to even define a long-term goal in
the reform of the rules of international trade,'' Lyng said. ``They
term our proposal to eventually eliminate trade-distorting
subsidies as `unrealistic' or `too far, too fast.' Yet, they have
not stated what alternative they will accept.''
   Lyng warned that failure to make progress in the negotiations by
the time of the GATT midterm review in Montreal next December
``will bring into question the change for eventual success'' of the
so-called Uruguay Round.
   ``I'm not pessimistic, but I'll have to admit there's not whole
lot to be optimistic about at this point,'' Lyng said.
   He added: ``I think the European Community, unless they show
some willingness to even discuss with us (their long-term
objectives) are going to wake up having the problem of failure of
these (talks) tossed in their laps. I think that will be unpopular
throughout the world. I know it will be, and I suspect they might
begin to come around a little bit.''
   It has been almost a year and a half since the new Uruguay Round
of multinational trade talks began under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. Yet, Lyng said, the major agricultural
shippers are expanding export subsidies, rather than reducing them.
   Lyng said the EEC, for example, has just paid a subsidy equal to
$126 per metric ton to wheat exporters, and continues to pay ``huge
subsidies on a host of other commodities,'' including mixed feed,
$291 per ton; durum wheat, $281 per ton; and barley, $130 per ton.
   The United States, he told a meeting of the Newspaper Farm
Editors of America, is calling for agricultural trade reform at the
Uruguay Round. Ultimately, under the U.S. proposal, international
trade barriers and subidies would be eliminated over a period of 10
years or so.
   Lyng said the ``excessive influence of governments in farm
product markets leads to a grossly inefficient allocation of
resources in developed countries and leave poorer, developing
countries in economic shambles.''
   The worst offenders are the big nations ``who are unwilling or
reluctant to change,'' he said. Japan, with huge trade surpluses
from exports of industrial and consumer goods, clings to import
barriers on products such as beef, rice and citrus.
   Other exporting countries, including the 12-nation EEC, say they
are not alone in subsidizing agricultural trade and point to the
Export Enhancement Program operated by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
   Under EEP, as it is known, private exporters are given surplus
USDA-owned commodities so they can sell grain or other products to
selected foreign countries, including the Soviet Union, China and
others. Department officials claim EEP was necessary to compete
with Europe's subsidized exports.

   Jesse Jackson plans to pour as much as $3
million into California and spend the better part of a month
campaigning there in an all-out effort to win in the nation's most
populous state, his campaign chairman said Monday.
   ``California will be a major player in the presidential
sweepstakes,'' said California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who
heads up Jackson's national presidential campaign.
   Noting that it is virtually impossible for either Democratic
front-runner Michael Dukakis or Jackson to get the necessary 2,081
delegates to win the nomination before California's June 7 primary,
Brown said, ``No matter what happens between now and then, we are a
player.''
   With his eye on the state's 314 delegates, Jackson will campaign
in Calfornia from May 5 through May 28, making only about two
forays to other states during that time, Brown told reporters
during a visit to the capital.
   For the first time in the campaign, Jackson may be able to
compete financially because his fund raising has picked up
tremendously, Brown said.
   ``In every place Jackson has been a candidate he has been
outspent three or four or five to one. California is a
media-oriented market. The way our money is coming in for us now,
it's clear we are going to be better than competitive in
California,'' he said.
   Dukakis has led the Democratic field in fund raising and
spending since the beginning of the primary season, but during
March he was not far ahead of Jackson, raising $2.4 million to
Jackson's $2 million.
   Jackson is counting on winning votes from groups that have
supported him in other states, including peace activists,
environmentalists and gay voters, as well as his strong black
constituency, Brown said.
   The battle for the state's sizable Hispanic population is
expected to be intense, with Jackson bringing in former New Mexico
Gov. Toney Anaya and former state health director Mario Obledo to
campaign for him. Dukakis speaks fluent Spanish and has done well
among Hispanics in other states.
   Brown said that if Jackson does well among his constituent
groups and can double the white vote that he got in 1984, he ``is
in a position to spring a surprise in California.''
   Jackson's campaign also hopes to get Dukakis to participate in
joint appearances and debates, but so far only one debate is
scheduled in California, Brown said.
   California is an issue-based state with such regional concerns
as offshore drilling, timber harvesting and coastal protection,
Brown said.
   ``Jackson is a lot smarter than you think,'' he said. ``He is
already hip on those issues.''
   Brown sought to undo recent comments he made about Jackson being
a vice presidential prospect if he does not win the presidential
nomination.
   He said Jackson is running for president only. He said that in
answering questions from reporters about the second spot on the
Democratic ticket, ``sometimes we're not as judicious in our
answers as we should be.''
   He said he knew of no conversations between Jackson aides and
the Dukakis camp about the vice presidential issue.

   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson said Monday he could conceive of situations where he would
grant safe passage to hostage-takers, saying ``I choose negotiation
over blind bloody confrontation.''
   Jackson rejected what he called ``material concessions'' to
terrorists but did not rule out political accommodation
   ``If we are going to deter terrorism, we must address the
underlying causes of terrorism,'' he said after an appearance at a
high school in Pittsburgh. ``Terrorism does not emerge out of the
blue.''
   Jackson met later with Gov. Bob Casey as he prepared for
Tuesday's Pennsylvania primary but the candidate was beseiged with
questions stemming from a statement he made Sunday.
   Jackson said then he disagreed with rival Michael Dukakis'
position that ``we should not negotiate with terrorists.'' Jackson
said, ``I disagree with that; If I could get the hostages out, I'd
do it.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Monday that the
U.S. government will ``talk to anyone, to any group, to any
government about the well-being and release of the Americans still
held hostage in Lebanon.''
   She added, ``We will not make concessions to terrorists or
compromise our fundamental principles.''
   But Jackson insisted, ``The fact is that our government has
talked with terrorists and has negotiated, in some instances
successfully. It is good as a policy, but there must be always
flexibility in the policy. ... We ought to take every initiative we
can to gain the freedom of the American hostages in Beirut.''
   Jackson said he believed it made sense to talk with terrorists
because no one else has direct control over the hostages.
   ``The reason that we must keep open to talking with terrorists,
or any enemy, is because in the final analysis terrorists, our
enemy, are the only ones who have the ability and power to end the
terror and declare peace. ... We must talk to them or find out what
their underlying grievances are about.''
   He noted that as a private citizen, he talked with the State
Department before making efforts on behalf of American hostages to
make sure he was not contradicting U.S. policy.
   ``The first principle is that we should not jeopardize our
national interests or national security,'' he said.
   He said he would not make ``material concessions'' to
terrorists, a term he defined that as ``giving something physical.''
   Jackson said in certain circumstances, he might be persuaded to
grant hostages safe passage and freedom from prosecution in
exchange for hostages.
   ``We did it to gain the freedom of the hostages in the TWA
airliner and I think it was the right thing to do,'' he said. He
was referring to the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jet in Lebanon.
   He also used the Attica prison uprising in 1971 as an example.
Jackson said then New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller ``charged and
there was nothing left but blood. I choose negotiation over blind
bloody confrontation.''
   It was Jackson's talks with Syrian leaders that led to the
release of captured Navy flyer Robert Goodman in 1984.

<HEAD>Court's Conservative Majority Shakes Liberals With Civil Rights
Action</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court is flexing its conservative
muscle, resurrecting fears among liberals that President Reagan may
have succeeded in pushing the court to the right.
   In a move that sparked sharp criticism and dire predictions from
opponents, a 5-4 court majority said Monday it is thinking about
overturning a 1976 decision considered a key civil rights victory.
   The ruling 12 years ago, never undone by Congress, interpreted a
Civil War-era law as permitting lawsuits for monetary damages
against private businesses and individuals over alleged racial
discrimination.
   The decision in Runyon vs. McCrary, adopted in hundreds of lower
court cases since, has become what one civil rights lawyer called
``a major strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure.''
   Four justices said Monday's announcement could shake minorities'
faith in the court.
   ``Time alone will tell whether the erosion of faith is
unnecessarily precipitous,'' said Justice John Paul Stevens, a
swing vote who most often sides with the court's liberals. ``But in
the meantime some of the harm that will flow from today's order may
never be completely undone.''
   Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, agreed. ``The message is there's a new court and previous
rulings are up for grabs,'' he said. ``If this decision possibly
can be overturned, perhaps a lot more are endangered.''
   The court's three Reagan appointees _ Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy _ joined Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Byron R. White in voting to
restudy the 1976 decision.
   Joining Stevens in dissent were Justices William J. Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall, the court's leading liberals; and Justice Harry
A. Blackmun, another swing vote.
   Will there be five votes to overturn the 1976 precedent?
   Rehnquist, long the court's most conservative member, and White,
a conservative with a generally liberal voting record in civil
rights cases, dissented from the 1976 decision. They are two likely
votes to overturn.
   Scalia is considered as conservative as Rehnquist, and a third
vote to overturn.
   The keys may be the votes of O'Connor, who in recent years has
shown greater independence from the court's conservative bloc, and
Kennedy, whose impact to date has been minimal because he only
joined the court in February.
   Kennedy won Senate confirmation after Reagan's nomination of
Robert H. Bork was rejected.
   Bork's critics in the Senate and among civil rights
organizations said they feared his replacing centrist Lewis F.
Powell on the court could threaten 30 years of civil rights
precedents.
   In its first seven years, the Reagan administration has had
little success persuading the court to adopt the president's
conservative agenda: outlawing abortion, restoring prayers in
public schools and curtailing affirmative action.
   Kennedy, whose views on such matters are unknown, is viewed as a
staunch conservative but less ideological than Bork. The concerns
voiced during the Bork nomination fight were echoed Monday, however.
   Calling Kennedy the key to a ``new court,'' the ACLU's Glaser
said, ``Bork had an extensive record of civil rights animus and
Kennedy did not. But this isn't encouraging.''

<HEAD>Study Faults Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Investigative Office</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission needs to
improve its investigative office to ensure that its work is done
competently and professionally, according to a congressional study
released Monday.
   ``The important mission and critical safety role of the NRC
require that it possess a first-rate investigative capability,''
the General Accounting Office said in the study, which was released
by the NRC.
   GAO, the investigative wing of Congress, said the study was
based on the review of three investigations made within the nuclear
agency. GAO said that in two cases, the work done by the NRC's
office and inspector and auditor was not thorough enough.
   One case involved allegations by an NRC inspector that superiors
had pressured him to change findings in 1986 about safety
conditions at the Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station in Texas.
   The other involved alleged improper discussions in 1986 between
Victor Stello, the NRC's executive director of operations, and
Steve White, head of the Tennessee Valley Authority's NRC-regulated
nuclear program.
   GAO said its review supported the findings of NRC investigators
who said neither matter was improper. But in both cases GAO said
NRC investigators had not interviewed individuals with key roles.
   The third case looked into NRC's investigation of how a copy of
an internal NRC document turned up in 1985 in the files of the
Louisiana Power and Light Co.'s Waterford III plant _ along with a
memo from LPL's holding company saying the document had been
``received from sources inside'' the NRC.
   GAO said notations on the copy indicated it was duplicated from
the file copy in the office of NRC Commissioner Thomas Roberts, who
was in charge of investigating the alleged leak.
   GAO was critical of the ``very limited'' investigation made by
Roberts, but GAO said it was unable to determine how the copy
reached the regulated utility.
   ``A properly conducted investigation might have provided NRC
with the identity'' of the leaker, according to GAO.
   The case, GAO said, ``demonstrated that a regulated utility
secured unauthorized access to NRC documents. The ability to obtain
such materials could impact on the NRC's enforcement program,
licensing functions and regulatory procedures.''
   ``The NRC should assure that its investigators conduct their
work in a competent manner using professional standards,'' said
GAO, adding that there is a lack of coordination between the NRC's
office of investigations and office of inspector and auditor.
   NRC Chairman Lando Zech said in a statement accompanying the GAO
study that he agrees the agency needs a first-rate investigative
capability.
   ``The commission will give careful consideration to (the) entire
report in our continuing efforts to assure that we carry out our
investigative responsibilities fairly and efficiently,'' Zech said.

   OPEC and independent oil exporters on
Monday made last-minute preparations for a series of meetings aimed
at tightening oil supplies and driving prices up further.
   Officials of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
and rival oil producers expressed cautious optimism that an
agreement could be reached this week on joint measures to support
prices.
   ``Any meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC (nations) is important,
but this one is particularly so because prices seem to be weak,''
said Indonesian delegate Subroto, a former oil minister.
   He said all 13 countries participating in the meetings Tuesday
were ``eager to do something'' to prop up prices.
   World oil markets appeared to be taking a cautiously optimistic
stance on the upcoming conferences.
   In the European spot, or non-contract, market, the price of
Brent crude from the North Sea was up about 10 cents a barrel, at
$17.25, in late trading, compared with last Friday's close. Traders
said activity was light.
   Futures prices also edged upward on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, where contracts for June delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at $18.40 per
barrel, up 10 cents from Friday.
   Senior officials from Mexico, Colombia, Egypt, Angola, Oman,
Malaysia, Brunei and China were to meet Tuesday and Wednesday with
OPEC's price monitoring committee, comprised of the oil ministers
of Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Venezuela, Nigeria and Algeria.
   That is to be followed on Thursday by a meeting of all 13 OPEC
members.
   Also in Vienna, though not expected to participate in the joint
meetings, was Kent Hance, a member of the Texas Railroad
Commission, which regulates the state's oil production of 2 million
42-gallon barrels a day. He has indicated he plans to meet
individually with ministers to discuss his concern about
instability in the oil market.
   Mexico's oil minister, Fernando Hiriart Balderrama, told
reporters that Mexico was ready to accept a 5 percent cut in its
oil exports if other producers agreed to do the same. He declined
to be specific about how many, or which, others must go along.
   Mexico exports about 1.4 million barrels a day of its total
daily output of 2.9 million.
   ``We know that it might be difficult to reach unanimity'' at
this week's meetings, Hiriart Balderrama said through an
interpreter. ``But we expect a substantial number of countries to
do something similar'' to Mexico's proposed cut.
   Together, the eight non-OPEC countries represented in Vienna
produce about 8 million barrels a day, compared with OPEC's
estimated output of between 17.5 million and 18 million barrels
daily.
   Industry analysts expressed doubt that this week's meeting could
reach a concrete agreement on OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts.
But some said it could mark a turning point in OPEC's long and
largely unsuccessful campaign to win closer cooperation with rival
producers.
   The world's two biggest oil producers _ the Soviet Union and the
United States _ were not invited to the Vienna meeting.

   Larry Singleton, who raped a young woman
and cut off her forearms with an ax a decade ago, was freed from
parole Monday and headed for an undisclosed location, his case
continuing to arouse public outrage.
   ``He was a free man according to law at 12:01 (a.m.) today, and
he just simply walked off parole from the place he was located,''
said Bob Gore, spokesman for the California Department of
Corrections.
   ``We have no legal right to follow him any further and no
statutory means of requiring him to go somewhere,'' he said.
   Bob Plath, a member of an inmate support group, said he knew
where Singleton planned to go but could not reveal the location for
fear someone might hurt Singleton.
   Singleton, 60, was convicted of abducting a teen-age hitchhiker,
raping her and then hacking off her forearms near Modesto, 45 miles
east of San Francisco, in 1978. He served eight years of a 14-year
sentence.
   He was under no obligation to tell officials where he planned to
go when his year of parole expired, and gave only noncommital
answers when asked, Gore said.
   ``I think he is very dangerous and unstable. I think he's
operating under a delusion (of innocence),'' said Donald Stahl,
Stanislaus County district attorney. ``I don't know what will
happen when the pressure gets to be too much or if he falls off the
wagon.''
   Singleton, who was drinking heavily the day of the attack, has
not had alcohol during his imprisonment or parole, officials said.
   Singleton's victim, Mary Vincent, is living at an undisclosed
location and still fears Singleton. Her lawyer said she wants to
remain undisturbed and in seclusion.
   Singleton has friends and supporters who do not accept his
claims of innocence but believe he will not be dangerous if he is
lef alone and can stay with people who care about him.
   ``While we can't forget, can't we forgive?'' said Plath, a Marin
County lawyer.
   Angry protests followed Singleton from town to town last year
when officials tried to place him in several San Francisco Bay area
communities on parole. Singleton was finally put in a small trailer
on the grounds of San Quentin prison to complete his parole, but a
few days ago he was moved to an undisclosed location.
   The protests now have shifted north to Azalea, Ore., where
Singleton reportedly will join The Bride of Christ Church after
visiting family in Florida. Frightened residents have denounced the
plan, and earlier this month someone fired a shotgun at church
buildings and vehicles.

<HEAD>State Department Official To Discuss Bering Sea Fish Ban With
Other Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top State Department official said Monday he
will meet with representatives of Japan, South Korea, China and
Poland about a possible voluntary agreement to ban fishing in an
area of the Bering Sea that scientists fear is being overfished.
   Edward Wolfe, ambassador of oceans and fisheries, said he will
brief the four nations in the next few days on U.S.-Soviet fishing
talks last week that included discussion of a moratorium on fishing
in the Bering Sea's so-called ``doughnut hole.''
   While no agreement was reached between the United States and the
Soviet Union over the future of fishing in the ``doughnut hole,''
another round of meetings is expected in Moscow later this spring.
   Wolfe earlier had said the U.S.-Soviet negotiations were
``exploratory'' and involved a ``good exchange of views.''
   Both countries are concerned that overfishing in the ``doughnut
hole,'' by foreign trawlers _ including those from Japan, South
Korea, China and Poland _ could cause a decline in the catch in the
U.S. and Soviet fishing zones that surround the area.
   The 4,500-square mile ``doughnut hole'' is considered one of the
richest fishing grounds in the world and the catch in the area has
grown from about 200,000 metric tons to more than 1 million metric
tons over the past four years.
   Both the Soviets and the U.S. would prefer a voluntary ban on
fishing in the ``doughnut hole.'' The moratorium could be temporary
or permanent as scientists study the fish stocks in the Bering Sea.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III put five
temporary replacements on the job Monday to fill vacant Justice
Department posts.
   In addition, Francis Keating plans to be running the No. 3
office at the department by the end of the week. Keating is the
assistant Treasury Department secretary nominated by President
Reagan on Friday to become associate attorney general.
   Keating will move in to the post on an acting basis until
confirmed by the Senate, said Justice Department spokesman Patrick
Korten. Keating would replace Stephen Trott, who left earlier this
month to become a federal appeals court judge.
   Meese appointed Grace Mastalli and C.H. Albright as assistants
in the associate attorney general's office. Keating will choose his
own deputies after he arrives.
   Mastalli works in the executive office of U.S. attorneys and
Albright has been a special assistant to Assistant Attorney General
John Bolton, now in charge of the civil division.
   Department aides James Byrnes, John Howard and Thomas Christina
were named to fill three slots in the office of former Deputy
Attorney General Arnold Burns.
   Byrnes works in the department's lands division, Howard is
special counsel for personnel and Christina is a deputy in the
Office of Legal Policy.
   Burns is one of two Justice Department officials who resigned in
protest March 29 over Meese's continued tenure. Five of Burns' six
deputies are leaving. Burns' last day on the job was Friday, two
days after he and former Assistant Attorney General William Weld
outlined their objections to Meese in a blunt face-to-face meeting
with Reagan at the White House.
   Burns said a malaise has infected the Justice Department and
Weld said that if it were up to him, he would seek an indictment of
Meese for his involvement with longtime friend E. Robert Wallach.

   George Bush, campaigning on the eve of the
primary that should put him over the top, promised Monday to keep
``showing the flag'' no matter how firm his grip on the Republican
presidential nomination.
   ``I still want to continue to campaign through the primary
season,'' Bush told the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce.
   Bush spent the day traveling and speaking in the state, where he
is expected to top the 1,139 delegates needed for the GOP
nomination in Tuesday's primary.
   Most of his remarks were routine, but he answered back after
being met at the Scranton-Wilkes Barre airport by a dozen or so
hecklers, some of them bearing signs urging the United States to
end its aid to the Contras in Nicaragua.
   ``I'm glad to see the (Jesse) Jackson supporters here, or maybe
the Mike Dukakis supporters,'' he said. ``I will welcome them in
debate, I will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them
in the fall.''
   He has been virtually unopposed for the Republican nomination
since the withdrawal last month of Sen. Bob Dole. His only
remaining opponent, Pat Robertson, has ceased active campaigning.
   Bush, who has said he expects to face Democrat Michael Dukakis
in the fall election, struck at Democrats who he said ``talk about
despair and agony.''
   ``You're going to see a clear choice'' in the general election,
he said.
   He called Pittsburgh ``tough and resilient'' and compared its
revival to his own.
   ``You took it on the chin'' economically in the 1970s and early
1980s, Bush said.
   ``I know what it's like to be knocked to the canvas,'' he said,
noting his defeat in the Iowa caucuses.
   But Bush said he picked himself up and started anew, calling
that ``a parallel to what you demonstrated here.''
   Despite his apparently insurmountable lead, he said, ``I'm still
showing the flag in Pennsylvania.''
   At campaign stops through the day, Bush:
   _Said he intends to take part in general-election debates with
the Democratic nominee, but he would not be pinned down on dates or
format.
   ``There will be debates. I'm looking forward to them, he said.
But he also said, in an interview with local reporters, ``I'm not
going to let some outside group, even within my own party, set the
agenda.''
   _Said he is in full accord with President Reagan's promise to
veto trade legislation nearing final congressional approval but
also said he hoped some other way could be found to notify workers
of impending plant closings.
   The bill contains a provision requiring 60 days notice when
plants are to be shut down. ``I know it's an emotional issue but it
interferes with our ability to compete.''
   _Told a Republican veterans' rally he would try to maintain the
defense buildup begun by Reagan. ``I'll never be afraid to reach
out for peace, but I'll do it with my eyes open,'' he said.

   Jews seeking to emigrate are receiving revised
invitations from Israel that promise to provide them with visas in
Romania, activists said Monday.
   The activists said the change is apparently part of an effort to
boost emigration to the Jewish state. But it could make it
difficult for Jews to settle anywhere else, they said.
   Invitations from family members and the Israeli government are
the official basis on which Jews are allowed to leave. Visas now
come through the Dutch Embassy, which has handled Israel's
interests since the Kremlin broke relations after the 1967 Middle
East war.
   Sergei Mkrtchyan said Monday he knew of about a half a dozen
people who did not emigrate because the Soviet visa office said
they could go only to Israel with the new invitations.
   ``They rejected it because they wanted to go to America,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   According to the new invitations, Israeli visas will be issued
in Bucharest, capital of Romania, the only Soviet bloc nation that
has formal relations with Israel.
   Michael Stolar, an American citizen who remains in Moscow
because his Soviet wife is refused permission to leave, said Jews
who want to go somewhere other than Israel are worried.
   ``A lot of people are talking about the problem _ whether it
will increase or decrease emigration, whether the Soviets will let
more people out or whether fewer people will apply,'' he said.
   Both he and Mkrtchyan want to go to Israel and are active in a
group called ``Poor Relatives,'' for people who are denied
permission to leave because a family member will not waive
financial obligations imposed by law.
   They said the new invitations began arriving about three weeks
ago and the long-term effect is unclear.
   In the past, many Soviet Jews left the country through Vienna,
and traveled from there to Western Europe, the United States or
Israel.
   Mkrtchyan said it could be difficult for Jews to go anywhere
except Israel from Bucharest because of limited connections and
because a Jew arriving in Israel automatically becomes an Israeli
citizen, limiting his ability to settle elsewhere.
   Jews who emigrate from the Soviet Union lose their Soviet
citizenship.
   Israel wants Soviet Jews to settle there and has promoted a
direct air link via Romania. Among those emigrating through
Bucharest was Josef Begun, a prominent Soviet Jew who emigrated in
January.
   According to the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, only 221 of
the 986 who emigrated in March went to Israel, and 42 traveled
through Bucharest.
   The 986 represented the highest total in 15 months. More than
8,000 Jews were allowed to emigrate in all of 1987, many more than
in any of the previous several years but still far below the peak
of 51,000 in 1979. More than 2,400 Jews emigrated in the first
three months of 1988.
   Sources said Israel instructed the Dutch Embassy to continue
issuing visas with which Jews can emigrate through Vienna or any
other transit city, but activists said that may not matter if
Soviet authorities insist on emigrants going by way of Romania.
   Requiring Jews to leave through Bucharest may increase the
number going to Israel by 5 to 10 percent, but the rest want to
settle elsewhere, Mkrtchyan said.

<HEAD>Oregon Newspaper Survey Shows White Resistance to Jackson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large number of Oregonians say Jesse
Jackson cannot win the presidential election because he is black,
but only a small number say they won't vote for him because of his
race, according to a newspaper poll.
   The Sunday Oregonian reported that only 5 percent of the voters
surveyed indicated they would not support Jackson because he is
black.
   But 30 percent of those surveyed said they doubted that Jackson
could win a presidential election.
   Pam Smith, an Oregonian who works for Jackson in Chicago as a
press aide, said the focus on race hurts Jackson.
   ``Was there a question of how would Americans accept a Greek?''
she asked, referring to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
Jackson's remaining rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   The poll of 600 registered voters was conducted for the
newspaper April 11-16 by Griggs-Anderson Research. It included
Democrats, Republicans and independant voters.

<HEAD>Brigham Young Place-Kicker Stumps for Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technically, Jason Chaffetz isn't a member
of the Dukakis family, but the Brigham Young University
place-kicker is like one of the clan when it comes to the
Massachusetts governor's bid for the presidency.
   Chaffetz, the son of Kitty Dukakis' first husband and his wife,
says a close relationship with the family spurred him to stump
through Georgia and Iowa, and also led him to take the role of Utah
co-chairman for Dukakis' Utah effort.
   Sandwiching campaigning between football workouts and semester
finals, Chaffetz, 21, devoted the past few weeks to preparations
for Monday night's statewide political caucuses.
   Chaffetz is linked to the presidential hopeful through his
half-brother, John Dukakis, who remained with his mother after she
and John's father, John Chaffetz, were divorced.
   ``I really believe in Michael Dukakis, and the kind of moral
leadership he's had for my brother,'' Chaffetz said. ``If he can be
a stepfather for my brother, he can be a stepfather for the
nation.''

<HEAD>Ohio Congressmen Urge Candidates to Support Space Funding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Ohio's congressional delegation on
Monday called on the presidential candidates to focus more
attention on the U.S. space program during their campaigns.
   ``As someone with first-hand experience in both the race for
space and the race for the presidency ... I know it can be easier
to get into orbit than into the White House,'' said Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio. ``But once in the White House, the next president
must be committed to a strong American presence in space.''
   Glenn, a former astronaut who was the first American to orbit
the earth, ran for the Democratic nomination for president four
years ago.
   He said other countries besides the United States and the Soviet
Union are developing space programs. Consequently, he said, the
U.S. space program ``will help determine our position of political
leadership among nations for decades to come.''
   Glenn and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, spoke from Washington
via satellite to a news conference in Cleveland.
   ``A strong civilian space program is our future,'' Metzenbaum
said. ``It will enable us to explore new horizons. It will create
new jobs ... and it will give us the technology to leap ahead in
medicine, communications and electronics here at home.''

<HEAD>Holocaust Survivors Shout `Bravo!' Upon Demjanjuk Conviction</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Demjanjuk, Bjt</HEAD>

   Holocaust survivors hugged each other and
shouted ``Bravo, bravo!'' when an Israel judge on Monday sentenced
retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk to death for Nazi war crimes.
   Other Israelis, however, said they were uncomfortable with the
imposition of the death penalty.
   In the Cleveland area, where the Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk lived
for more than 30 years before his 1986 extradition to Israel, the
sentence increased the grief and anger of the local Ukrainian
community. Ukrainian-Americans there prayed and raised money for
the man they believe to be innocent.
   When Judge Zvi Tal, whose parents were killed in the Holocaust,
announced the sentence, dozens of courtroom spectators jumped to
their feet shouting ``Bravo, bravo!'' and ``Death, death!'' and
singing ``The people of Israel live.''
   But Ephraim Zuroff, head of the Israeli branch of the Simon
Wiesenthal center, told Israel radio that while he understood the
emotional outburst, it was ``totally uncalled for and just lends
credence to ... (defense claims) that someone like Demjanjuk can't
get a fair trial in Israel.''
   The center collects and provides to authorities information on
suspected Nazi war criminals.
   Some survivors wept with emotion as the sentence was announced.
   ``The only justice will be to give him to the survivors and let
them finish him off piece by piece,'' said Frances Jason of Los
Angeles, who survived the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied
Poland.
   ``A thousand death (penalties) cannot compensate for what
happened, but at least we have passed judgment on one of the angels
of death,'' said Yosef Czarny, a survivor of Treblinka death camp,
where 850,000 Jews were killed in 1942-43.
   The court last week convicted Demjanjuk, 68, of being ``Ivan the
Terrible,'' a sadistic guard at Treblinka who operated gas chambers
and tortured inmates before sending them to their deaths.
   About 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. A stated goal
of Israel, which was founded after the Nazi slayings, is to bring
Adolf Hitler's henchmen to justice.
   U.S. industrialist Armand Hammer, who aided Israel in obtaining
evidence that helped lead to Demjanjuk's conviction, told a news
conference in Beijing Monday before the sentence was announced
``there's no question in my mind ... (that Demjanjuk) is guilty.''
   Hammer, chairman of Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum, was
in China to sign a new joint venture agreement. He helped Israel
obtain a Nazi identification card that purportedly was issued to
Demjanjuk as a camp guard.
   Demjanjuk's son-in-law, Ed Nishnic of Cleveland, told a news
conference in Toronto that Demjanjuk was sentenced to death because
Jews are haunted by memories of the Holocaust and desperate to
punish those guilty of war crimes.
   ``But we believe there is doubt ... (Demjanjuk) is Ivan the
Terrible,'' said Nishnic. ``He's been falsely convicted. The real
Ivan the Terrible does not have our sympathy or our support, he
should be sentenced to death.''
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Israel army radio, ``If he
(Demjanjuk) was a Nazi ... who killed thousands of people, I have
no problems with the severity of the punishment.''
   But Chaim Dasberg, a psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, said
many Israelis feel uncomfortable with the death penalty even if
they believe it is the correct punishment for Nazi war criminals.
   Dasberg said he himself opposed the death penalty ``for several
reasons, among them humanitarian ones.''
   ``But this goes beyond that. There are criminals and there are
criminals,'' he said.
   The Rev. John Bruchok of St. Mary's Ukrainian Orthodox Church in
Lorain, Ohio, said Monday, ``It's a travesty of justice.''
   Bruchok met Demjanjuk and his family shortly before Demjanjuk
was sent to Israel to stand trial.
   The priest said, ``I saw his face. I saw the face of a gentle
man who was scared. An innocent man is being executed.''
   The Rev. John Nakonachny, a priest at St. Vladimir's Ukrainian
Orthodox Church in Parma, the Demjanjuk family parish, said, ``It
has been the unanimous opinion of this parish that Demjanjuk is
innocent. That has been the opinion since the beginning.''
   Demjanjuk, a retired Ohio autoworker, lived in the Cleveland
suburb of Seven Hills.
   After he was convicted, Jewish organizations in Akron, about 40
miles south of Cleveland, asked for police protection because
callers were threatening local Jews.
   Mary Dackiewicz, who operates the John Demjanjuk Defense Fund,
said that after the sentencing Monday, she had received many
telephone calls.
   ``The phone calls are from people who have been totally outraged
at what happened over there,'' she said.
   Edgar Bronfman of Montreal, World Jewish Congress president,
said he is not a believer in capital punishment, ``but for
Holocaust criminals such as Demjanjuk, I would be hard pressed not
to impose the death sentence.''

<HEAD>Iran Calls for More Volunteers, Iraq Says New Missile Tested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran called Monday for the nation's youth
to prepare to go quickly to the battlefront. Iraq announced it has
successfully tested a new missile capable of reaching deep into
Iranian territory.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran, speaking on Tehran Radio, said
young Iranians ``should get ready to to be sent to the fronts and
to fight against the enemies of the Islamic revolution in a most
extensive way.''
   ``The young people, especially those who have received training
and who are ready, should move forward their allotted time for
dispatch and go earlier. Others too should continue their dispatch
... in an accelerated form,'' he said.
   Tehran Radio said Khamenei spoke after a meeting of the Supreme
War Effort Council. The broadcast was monitored in Cyprus.
   Iran suffered a battlefield setback 10 days ago when Iraqi
forces recaptured the Faw peninsula in southern Iraq. It had been
seized by Iranian troops in February 1986.
   The two countries have been at war since September 1980.
   Iraq's official news agency, also monitored in Cyprus, said a
powerful new surface-to-surface missile has been tested
successfully.
   The announcement could serve as a warning to Iran not to respond
to the loss of Faw by resuming the deadly missile duel known as the
``war of the cities.'' The last such battle lasted from Feb. 29 to
last Thursday, with the capitals of Baghdad and Tehran being
frequent targets.
   Brig. Hussein Kamel Hassan, director of Iraq's military
industries, informed President Saddam Hussein that the new missile
named al-Abass has a range of 550 miles, according to the news
agency.
   Iraq has used al-Hussein missiles since last August in the duel
with Iran.
   It claimed the al-Hussein missiles were domestically produced,
but Western military analysts believe they are Soviet-designed SS-1
Scud-B weapons with special rocket boosters to give them a range of
up to 400 miles.
   The agency report gave no details of the new missile.
   Western analysts said they thought Iraq may have obtained a
larger missile that also could be equipped with boosters.
   There was a lull in action along the 730-mile front. Both sides
reported scattered skirmishes and artillery duels.

<HEAD>Big Storms In The South, Heavy Snow in Montana And Wyoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms shook parts of the South on Monday,
generating tornadoes that caused damage in Georgia and the Florida
Keys, and snow fell in the northern Rockies and the northern Plains.
   Thunderstorms, some severe, rolled across southern sections of
Alabama and Georgia during the morning.
   Two tornadoes touched down in rural Lowndes County in southern
Georgia, heavily damaging several homes and taking down trees and
power lines. No one was hurt.
   ``We've had extensive damage. There's been quite a few houses
which are wiped out completely,'' Lowndes County sheriff's deputy
Robert Rudd said. ``We've got lines down all over the area.''
   Later in the day, in western Georgia, a powerful storm system
spawned at least one tornado in Carroll County but it did not touch
down.
   In Naylor, Ga., the Volunteer Fire Department was heavily
damaged, and fire trucks held up what was left of the battered
building.
   By early afternoon, severe thunderstorms developed rapidly
across northern sections of Mississippi and Alabama as well as
west-central Georgia, and raced eastward at speeds up to 65 mph. A
severe thunderstorm over northwestern Alabama dropped hail as big
as golf balls near Goodsprings, about 25 miles northwest of
Birmingham.
   Severe thunderstorms also produced 1\-inch hail at Anniston,
Ala. One-inch hail pelted Carrollton, Ga., Coldwater, Ala., and
Cleburne County, Ala., during the afternoon. Marble-size hail fell
at Pinson, Ala., and covered the ground at Jones Chapel, Ala.
   ``The hail beat my car all to pieces,'' said Ellen Chaney of
Lowndes County, Ga.
   During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.02 inches of rain fell
at Albany, Ga.
   In Florida, a waterspout sighted near Key West moved ashore as a
tornado and caused some property damage on Stock Island, the
National Weather Service said.
   Elsewhere, light rain and spotty showers extended from
southeastern Kansas into western Kentucky.
   Heavy snow warnings were posted for south-central Montana and
mountains and foothills of central Montana and snow advisories were
posted for the mountains of northwestern Wyoming and the Big Horn
Mountains of northeastern Wyoming.
   By late morning, 5 inches of snow had fallen at both Bear Lodge
and Arrowhead Lodge in the Big Horn Mountains. Up to 8 inches of
snow was expected in the Big Horns.
   A snow advisory was also posted for Utah's northern mountains
above 5,500 feet.
   A winter storm watch was posted overnight for southwestern South
Dakota as the heart of the storm system was expected to move from
Wyoming into Nebraska.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 27 degrees at Cody, Wyo.,
to 92 at West Palm Beach, Fla. The morning low was 17 degrees at
Alamosa, Colo.
   For Tuesday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
eastern Tennessee through the Carolinas; light rain and showers
over the central Plains, the upper and middle Mississippi Valley
and the western Great Lakesl and showers from western Pennsylvania
to Vermont.
   Highs in the 40s and 50s were predicted from the northern and
central Rocky Mountains through the western Great Lakes, and across
northern New England; in the 60s from southeastern Kansas across
the Tennessee and Ohio valleys to the mid Atlantic Coast, and
across the Pacific Northwest through northern California and into
northern Arizona; in the 90s in the desert Southwest; and in the
70s and 80s over most of the rest of the nation.

Violation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iran-Contra prosecutor withdrew from the
case partly because he felt he had been impermissibly exposed to
the defendants' congressional testimony, independent counsel
Lawrence E. Walsh testified Monday.
   During a lengthy grilling by a lawyer for Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
L. North, Walsh revealed that associate independent counsel
Christopher Todd had withdrawn from participation in the case.
   Walsh said Todd withdrew partly because he believed he might be
tainted by congressional testimony given by three of the four
defendants under grants of limited immunity from prosecution.
   ``I don't know whether he was tainted or not,'' Walsh told
defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. ``All I know about Mr.
Todd, he chose to follow a certain course.''
   Todd, who remains on the independent counsel's staff doing
unrelated work, didn't explain the possible exposure because ``he
didn't want to taint me,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh did not say when Todd withdrew, but he was seen last month
in U.S. District Court when former National Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding
information from Congress about covert Reagan administration aid to
the Contras.
   The defense contends that forcing North, former National
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter and businessman Albert Hakim to
go to trial on conspiracy charges would violate their Fifth
Amendment right against self-incrimination because they were forced
to testify to Congress last summer.
   Arguing there was ``enormous taint'' of Walsh's staff as a
result of unprecedented publicity of the three defendants'
immunized testimony, Sullivan said: ``This case can't proceed if I
have any understanding of the Fifth Amendment.''
   No date has been set for the trial of the three men, who along
with retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, are accused of
conspiring to illegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the
Nicaraguan rebels. Secord testified on Capitol Hill without an
immunity grant.
   At the outset of Monday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Gerhard
A. Gesell barred any defense testimony on the ground that lawyers
for the defendants had disobeyed his order that they give Walsh
timely notice of the witness they intended to produce.
   ``The orders of the court are going to be complied with,''
Gesell told the defendants.
   ``We are going to proceed whether the atmosphere is one of
confrontation and name-calling or not,'' the judge told the
defendants and their lawyers, who had accused the judge in court
papers of establishing a procedure that ``makes a mockery'' of
their clients' rights.
   Late in the day, the defense filed a notice that it intended to
appeal Gesell's April 13 order to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here.
   ``I have a great sense of unfairness for my client when you
rebuke defense counsel,'' Sullivan, who denied he had violated the
order, told the judge after the midday recess.
   ``I don't believe you abided either with the letter or the
spirit of the court order,'' Gesell replied.
   During more than four hours of testimony, Walsh described
elaborate procedures he used to prevent investigators, prosecutors
and grand jurors from exposure to the testimony that North,
Poindexter, Hakim and other immunized witnesses gave Congress.
   Despite those procedures, Walsh said he was exposed to
information about immunized testimony on six occasions _ three
before the four defendants were indicted on March 16.
   ``I was never exposed to the testimony itself _ so far as I
know,'' Walsh said. The information he received was in the form of
summaries.
   Members of the staff were instructed to file reports of similar
episodes with John Douglass, a part-time independent counsel who
was designated to determine if such incidents of exposure would
require a prosecutor to leave the staff.
   But Walsh conceded under Sullivan's cross-examination that he
never looked at any of the reports Douglass received to determine
how well his procedures were working.
   ``If Douglass had too many breaches I would know about that,''
Walsh said.
   Although his orders sometimes called for subjective judgments, a
prosecutor would ``know he was jeopardizing the investigation if
he's careless,'' Walsh said.
   Walsh turned over Douglass' file to the court so that defense
lawyers could examine the reports and question the independent
counsel about them when the hearing resumes on Wednesday.
   Herbert J. Stern, a former federal judge and veteran prosecutor
representing Walsh on the immunity issue, said he can show that
``every bit of the evidence was independently derived.''
   ``The extensive procedures of insulation are just extras and are
really not needed,'' Stern said.
   Gesell said that exposure of a grand jury witness to immunized
testimony wouldn't necessarily scuttle the case, it might only mean
that the particular witness couldn't testify in the trial.
   ``Going ahead with the case and immunity are not necessarily
irreconcilable,'' he said.

<HEAD>Officials Sacrifice Marsh To Defend Other Wetland Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials planned Monday to sacrifice a
section of wildlife-rich marshland to an oil spill, saying the
tactic would save hundreds more acres of wetlands.
   ``We're trying to keep new areas from becoming oiled,'' said
Brian Hunter of the state Department of Fish and Game. ``We're
willing to try and capture as much oil as we can in 20 acres of
marsh.''
   About 21,000 gallons of thick, unrefined crude gushed Saturday
from a storage tank at Shell Oil Co.'s Martinez refinery, 30 miles
northeast of San Francisco.
   By Monday morning, a slick stretched for 10 miles in Suisun Bay
and Carquinez Strait but was beginning to dissipate in tidal
currents. The biggest concentration was confined to an area of
marshland and coated at least 100 birds.
   Coast Guard spotter planes, six vessels with oil skimmers and 16
vacuum tank-trucks raced to capture oil and save wetland animals.
Floating oil booms were laid in the water to keep oil away from
wildlife areas.
   Coast Guard spokesman Ken Massey estimated it could take until
next week to clean up the spill.
   Shell acknowledged responsibility for the spill, and Massey said
the company would have to pay for the costs of the clean-up and
damages, which would include new paint for the bottoms of thousands
of pleasure boats in area marinas.
   There was no immediate estimate of the damage.
   Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey said the spill was the company's
worst in 73 years. The last at the 850-acre refinery occurred in
June 1986 when a tank overflowed 8,000 gallons of oil.
   By Monday about 100 birds _ including egrets, avocets, cinnamon
teals, mallard ducks, grebes, herons and the endangered clapper
rail bird _ had been rescued and taken to centers in Berkeley and
Walnut Creek for cleaning, Hunter said. The spill also threatened
many nests.
   Volunteers also reported a dozen dead muskrats, several
oil-coated turtles and a dead heron.

   A youth apparently upset with the way
his gang was depicted in the movie ``Colors'' fatally shot a
possible rival gang member who was waiting in line to see the film,
police said Monday.
   Authorities were searching for Charles Vain Queen, 21, of Los
Angeles and two companions as suspects in Sunday's slaying of David
Dawson, 19, of Stockton, said Deputy Police Chief Lucian Neely.
   Witnesses, who said they knew Queen when he lived in Stockton,
told officers he was wearing a red handkerchief, which indicates
membership in the Bloods gang, while the victim had on a blue
handkerchief, signifying the Crips gang. Both gangs are based in
Los Angeles but have ``a presence'' in Stockton 300 miles north,
said Lt. David Swim.
   Some authorities had expressed worry that violence would result
from the film starring Robert Duvall and Sean Penn, but before this
shooting death, only minor incidents had been reported at theaters
around the country since it opened April 15.
   Swim said Dawson, his girlfriend, sister and brother-in-law were
waiting in line at the Regency Theater to buy tickets for the next
showing of the controversial film about Los Angeles gangs and
police.
   He said the shooting erupted after one of the suspects walked up
to Dawson and asked: ``Are you a ricket?,'' which the lieutenant
said is considered a derogatory term against the Crips gang.
   Dawson was shot in the head as he tried to flee. The bullet also
hit a 17-year-old girl in the line, but she was not seriously hurt.
   ``The suspects weren't happy with the way things were going on
the screen because apparently the gang they are affiliated with
wasn't winning,'' Neely said. ``They were creating a bit of a
disturbance, and when they left, they saw the blue (bandanna) and
made the derogatory comments.''
   A spokesman for Mann Theaters, which operates the Regency, said
it was pulling the movie from that theater but was not considering
withdrawing it from any of its other 450 screens in seven Western
states.
   Police Chief P.F. Calkins said he would ask the San Joaquin
County District Attorney's Office to seek an injunction barring
further showings of ``Colors'' here.
   Police and sheriff's deputies have patroled theaters in Los
Angeles and other places with known gangs during the screening of
the movie.
   The Guardian Angels, the self-styled citizen crime-fighters, had
been among those claiming the film glorified gangs and would prompt
violence by viewers.
   But Charles O. Glenn, executive vice president of Orion
Pictures, the film's distributor defended the movie's release.
   ``If there is anything this picture does not do, it does not
glorify gangs or gang violence.'' Glenn said.

   Four of the Navy's main non-nuclear missiles
still are having quality problems that have delayed delivery or
produced some substandard weapons, the General Accounting Office
said Monday.
   ``All of the missile systems we examined had defects _ that is,
they failed in one respect or another to conform with contract
specifications,'' said the congressional watchdog agency.
   The GAO reviewed the Phoenix, High-Speed Anti-Radiation (HARM),
Harpoon, and Sparrow missiles, four weapons deployed on a variety
of Navy ships for use against other ships and planes.
   The review, done for the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee, found:

<TEXT>
   _Design and workmanship problems on safety and arming devices
aboard the Phoenix AIM-54C, problems which the GAO said have
delayed deliveries of more than 500 Phoenix missiles. The weapon is
built by Hughes Aircraft of Tucson, Ariz.
   _Pressure transducers for some HARMs may not have been tested
before being put into the missiles. The transducer is used in
activating the weapon's target-seeking device. The chief contractor
is Texas Instruments.
   _Altimeters for the Harpoon were being accepted under a contract
deviation permitting a soldering-related condition which the GAO
said could affect the weapon's reliability. The main contractor is
McDonnell-Douglas.
   _Detonators on some Sparrows were unknowingly built without
enough explosive compound to set off the warhead. The chief
contractor is Raytheon.
   Most of the problems occurred at the level of subcontractors,
the GAO said.
   ``One common problem was that changes were made in manufacturing
processes which were unknown to the prime contractor, but affected
the quality of the product,'' the GAO told Congress.
   Many of the problems related to soldering, but it is unclear how
serious the problems are, the GAO said.
   ``Some contractors and government officials believe that certain
requirements in the Navy's soldering specification are more
stringent than necessary to have a reliable missile,'' the report
said.
   ``They cite high reliability rates and the successful use of
missiles that deviate from the soldering specifications as evidence
that the Navy's soldering specifications may be too stringent,'' it
said.
   The Pentagon, in a response that was part of the review, said it
partially agrees with the GAO.
   Jack Katzen, deputy assistant secretary of defense for systems,
said the Pentagon ``acknowledges that a number of problems have
been experienced during the production of Navy missiles.''
   But, Katzen added, ``contrary to the GAO implication, in no case
has the Navy knowingly accepted missiles suspected of containing
defects that could affect the performance of the missile. In any
case where the defects were determined to affect performance, the
contractor was required to take the necessary corrective actions.''
   In addition, the GAO noted, pilots, ordnance officers, and other
Navy officials aboard ships ``were satisfied with the missiles'
performance and capabilities and cited no particular problems.''

   U.S. and Soviet publishers agreed Monday to
breathe some glasnost into the high-tech field by jointly
publishing the first Russian-language magazine devoted to personal
computers.
   International Data Group Inc. said the venture with Radio i
Sviaz Publishers was the first joint publishing effort in the
Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet government is definitely interested in getting the
use of PCs widespread,'' IDG president Alex Leblois said. ``When
you think that a few years ago getting permission to use a
typewriter or a copying machine was very difficult, the change is
very great.''
   IDG publishes PC World, the second largest U.S. publication on
personal computers with a monthly circulation of about 475,000.
   The first issue of PC World USSR is scheduled to hit Soviet
newsstands at the end of June. A staff of seven Soviet writers and
editors will produce about one-third of the magazine's copy, with
the rest translated from European and the U.S. sources.
   The magazine will cost 2 rubles, or about $3.20 at the official
exchange rate, Leblois said.
   Eugene N. Salnicov, director of Radio i Sviaz, said some foreign
language computer journals are available in Moscow libraries but
that Soviet PC users have no information about developments within
the country.
   Personal computers are in their infancy in the Soviet Union,
with under 100,000 Western-made machines used only by a few
universities, government officers, scientists and engineers,
Salnicov said. But the country has a potential market of 30 million
users, he added.
   ``We feel that from what our experts think the PC enables you to
increase your labor productivity by several hundred percent, so
there's every reason to have them,'' Salnicov said.
   About 50,000 copies of the magazine's first issue will be
available in bookstores and on newsstands, ``which we know will not
come near to satisfying the demand,'' Salnicov said.
   Leblois said issues will average 150 pages or more, of which
about 20 percent will be advertising. Four issues a year are
initially planned.
   In keeping with Soviet guidelines on joint ventures adopted in
January 1987, the Soviet partner will own 51 percent of the project
and IDG will own 49 percent.
   Leblois said IDG has invested $250,000 into the project but
expects to recoup that almost immediately through advertising from
Western computer makers seeking a foothold in the Soviet Union.
   The magazine already has sold ads for its first issue to
companies including Microsoft, Atari, Ashton-Tate, Bull and
Siemens, he said. The first issue should carry $120,000 of ads,
Leblois said.
   The Soviets did not detail their investment, but in addition to
the seven writers, the magazine will be printed in the Soviet Union.
   ``As long as they can hold their investment down there's not
much to lose,'' Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Russian
Research Center at Harvard University, said of IDG's participation.
   ``The question is how long advertisers will be interested, if
they're selling to a Soviet audience which can't buy what they're
selling.''
   But Leblois noted that 16-bit personal computers, which include
the IBM PC and other compatible machines, can be exported to the
Soviet Union under relaxed guidelines agreed by Western countries
in January. He predicted that American, Western European and
Japanese computer makers will rush to secure joint-production
agreements.
   PC World USSR's sales will cover all production costs and
advertising revenues will be paid in Western currencies. That will
make it easier for IDG to repatriate earnings from the project,
something which has been a problem for other joint ventures
generating earnings in rubles.
   IDG hich publishes local language editions of PC World in 14
nations. It has published China Computerworld, a monthly, since
1980 and began a computer magazine in Hungary two years ago, its
only other publication in the east bloc.

   An Israeli navy patrol boat fired on a
guerrilla craft near the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre early
Monday and sank the boat, the military reported.
   Israel radio said both people aboard the rubber dinghy were
killed in the attack at about 3 a.m.
   An army official said the navy vessel was on a routine patrol
when it spotted the boat and opened fire.
   Israel radio quoted navy commander Gen. Avraham Ben Shoshan as
saying Arab guerrillas have stepped up attempts to infiltrate
Israel by sea.
   The Israeli military had reported two similar incidents since
December.
   It said that on Feb. 28, the navy sank a boat carrying
guerrillas from Tyre for a planned attack on unspecified targets in
Israel. The army said it did not know how many people were aboard
the craft or if any were killed.
   On Dec. 11, guerrillas from Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem group, fired at an Israeli patrol vessel, killing one
soldier, according to the military. It said the Israeli craft
returned the fire, sinking the Hezbollah boat, and four guerrillas
drowned.

   The government will hire foreign experts to train
a special, 100-member anti-terrorism force to combat hijackers like
those who commandeered a Kuwait Airways jumbo jetliner this month,
security officials said Monday.
   Kuwait's crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, meanwhile called on ``sister and friendly states'' to
arrest, try and punish the hijackers and asked for inter-Arab
cooperation to fight terrorism.
   He said he did not know if the hijackers were still in Algeria,
where the ordeal ended on its 16th day last Wednesday.
   Kuwait's move came amid growing fears in Arab states that the
7{-year-war between Iran and Iraq will increase terrorism by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups. Saudi Arabia intends to form its
own anti-terrorist squad, it was reported last month.
   The Saudis are to receive help from Gen. Ulrich Wegener,
commander of West Germany's crack anti-terrorist force. He headed
the commandos that stormed a hijacked Lufthansa jetliner in
Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1977, considered a classic anti-hijacking
operation.
   Many West European countries, including Britain, France, Italy
and West Germany, have elite units which have acted against
terrorists over the last 20 years.
   The new Kuwaiti force will be directed by the Interior Ministry
after a six-month training program by foreign experts in Kuwait and
abroad, said the security officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   They gave no details and did not identify the foreign
specialists.
   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems hijacked the Kuwaiti Boeing 747 with
112 people aboard April 5 as it was flying from Bangkok, Thailand,
to Kuwait. The hijackers killed two Kuwaiti passengers before the
ordeal ended in Algiers on Wednesday.
   The hijackers demanded that Kuwait release 17 terrorists
convicted for bombing the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in
1983. Kuwaiti officials said they would not release them.
   The hijacking ended when the gunmen slipped off the jet,
apparently after receiving a promise of safe passage to an
undisclosed country. The passengers left the plane shortly
afterward.
   Rashed Abdel-Aziz Rashed, minister of state for Cabinet affairs,
told Saudi Arabia's al-Sharq al-Awsat newspaper that Kuwait had not
been told of the hijackers' whereabouts.
   However, the right-wing daily newspaper al-Seyassa and the
radical al-Rai al-Aam daily reported Monday that Kuwaiti security
authorities, aided by unidentified foreign intelligence agencies,
have identified the hijackers. It did not elaborate.
   Rashed told al-Seyassa that ``certain powers and parties hostile
to the Arabs were behind the hijacking.'' It was an apparent
reference to Iran and the pro-Iranian, Lebanon-based Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   Iran is Persian, not Arab. Although it shares the Moslem
religion with the Arabs, it adheres to the minority Shiite sect
that has been at odds with the predominant Sunni branch of Islam
for 1,300 years.
   The Shiite fundamentalist Hezbollah is believed to be the
umbrella group for Shiite factions holding most of the 21 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   The Kuwaiti Cabinet set up a committee to investigate the
hijacking, Rashed announced Sunday, saying ``murdering the two
Kuwaiti passengers is a crime that will not go unpunished.''
   Prime Minister Saad told editors of local and weekly newspapers
in a televised news conference Monday that tiny, oil-rich Kuwait
``alone cannot put an end to or contain the activity of terrorists.
I hereby issue a frank and sincere call to our Arab brethren to
cooperate to fight terrorism and terrorists wherever they exist.''
   ``The apprehension, trial and punishment of the (Kuwait Airways)
hijackers should take place through constructive dialogue between
us and sister and friendly states,'' Saad said.
   He also said that when the jet landed at Mashhad airport in Iran
early in its Odyssey, Iranian officials pressed the Kuwaiti team
which flew to Mashhad ``to accept all or part of the hijackers'
demands, but the Kuwaiti reply was a clear and frank rejection.''

<HEAD>Security Council Condemns Wazir Slaying, U.S. Abstains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council on Monday condemned
the assassination of the PLO's military commander and the United
States abstained, allowing the resolution to pass 14-0.
   America has frequently used its veto power as one of the
council's five permanent members to block resolutions criticizing
Israel.
   The resolution did not explicitly accuse Israel of killing
Khalil Wazir, the No. 2 man in the Palestine Liberation
Organization, but Israeli sources and Tunisian officials have said
Wazir was slain by Israeli commandos.
   Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, was shot to death April 16 at
his home in suburban Tunis.
   Israel has not made any official response to the claims that it
was responsible for the assassination, and it boycotted the council
debate.
   Diplomats said the resolution probably would have been vetoed by
the United States if it had specifically blamed Israel.
   The resolution ``condemns vigorously the aggression perpetrated
... against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tunisia in
flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations,
international law and norms of conduct.''
   The carefully negotiated text mentions Israel by name twice.
   It cites a 1985 resolution passed after Israel bombed the PLO
headquarters, which denounced ``acts of aggression,'' and in the
preamble notes Tunisia complained to the council about a new
Israeli act of aggression.
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert Okun said one reason the United States
could not vote for the resolution was that it contained language
suggesting sanctions.
   The resolution expressed the council's ``determination to take
the appropriate steps to ensure the implementation of the present
resolution.''
   Okun said the measure ``disproportionately places all blame for
this latest round in the rising spiral of violence in the Middle
East on one event only, while failing to mention other actions that
preceded it.''
   Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein, contacted by telephone,
declined comment on the U.S. abstention. He accused the Security
Council of putting Israel on trial even though it ``has made no
admission'' of responsibility.
   He also said the council had ignored Wazir's terrorist past, and
the fact that Wazir masterminded a 1978 bus hijacking in which 35
Israelis were killed.
   ``The PLO, including Abu Jihad, took responsibility and
glorified those acts of terrorism which they planned and
perpetrated and the Security Council never dealt with it and never
condemned it,'' Bein said.
   Both Tunisia and the PLO expressed satisfaction that the measure
passed, but it did not ``fully come up to our expectations,'' said
Foreign Minister Mahmoud Mestiri of Tunis.
   Okun referred to Tunisia as a friend of the United States and
said ``the perpetration of political assassination on Tunisian soil
stands in stark contrast to Tunisia's longstanding tradition of
non-violence.''
   During three days of debate, scores of speakers accused Israel
of practicing state terrorism.
   The permanent members of the 15-member council are the United
States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China.
   Although Security Council resolutions are considered binding,
they are often ignored.

   An Episcopal church used a court order to
turn a family away from services because of a 9-year-old boy's
disruptive behavior, but the family found at least temporary refuge
at another house of worship.
   Sheryl Geartz, her son, Jason, and 7-year-old daughter, Jessica,
were turned away from a service Sunday at Grace Episcopal
Cathedral, Topeka's largest Episcopal congregation.
   Officials at Grace had obtained a temporary restraining order
from a district judge last week barring Jason, who they claim has
disrupted services since the family began attending the church
seven months ago.
   After being denied entry, the family was taken by a reporter to
St. David's Episcopal Church, where they attended a service without
incident. As they left, they were greeted by Harry Craig, a deacon
at the church.
   ``Literally, anyone is welcome at St. David's,'' Craig said
Monday in an interview. ``My feeling at this point is: I greeted
her, I met her children and she certainly is welcome to return.
There was no disruption.''
   Officals at Grace Cathedral said the boy had talked loudly,
pulled a fire alarm, thrown objects at worshippers and destroyed
church property during past services. The church's court action did
not specify what the boy had thrown or destroyed.
   ``The level of disturbance moved from being merely annoying to
being utterly intolerable,'' said the Rev. Robert P. Shahan, dean
of Grace Cathedral. ``We were faced with a situation in which one
person had determined her needs were paramount to the needs of the
entire congregation.''
   Ms. Geartz, who is divorced and does not work, told reporters
Sunday her son has been disruptive, but she maintained he has
emotional problems that have improved through church attendance.
   She said she went to Grace Cathedral on Sunday because she
wanted to take a stand for emotionally disturbed people. She said
she would pray this week before deciding whether to attempt to
return there.
   There was no answer to repeated calls to the Geartz residence
Monday.
   A church secretary at Grace Cathedral said she fielded 21 calls
Monday about Ms. Geartz, of which 13 endorsed the church's action
and eight were opposed.

   India began fencing its border with
Pakistan on Monday in an effort to curb the supply of weapons to
Sikh militants fighting for a separate homeland, news reports said.
   State-run television said barbed-wire fences were being erected
along parts of the border in northern Punjab state, where India
claims Pakistan is providing support to Sikh separatists.
   Pakistan has denied the allegations.
   Predominantly Hindu India and mainly Moslem Pakistan have fought
three wars since gaining independence from Britain in 1947.
   Meanwhile, Sikh militants shot and killed seven more people in
Punjab overnight. The United News of India news agency said the
victims, six of them Sikhs, were killed in three separate attacks.
   The militants view moderate Sikhs as traitors.
   The killings brought to 815 the number of people killed in
attacks blamed on Sikh militants this year.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 800 million peoeple but comprise
a majority in Punjab. The separatists are demanding an independent
homeland, claiming discrimination by the majority Hindus. Sikhism
if an offshoot of the Hindu religion.

   Lanny Ross, an actor and singer whose smooth,
classically trained tenor made him one of the most popular stars of
radio's golden era, died Monday. He was 82.
   Ross died of heart failure at Lenox Hill Hospital, where he had
been admitted after two recent strokes, family members said.
   Ross, whose theme song was ``Moonlight and Roses,'' was a
familar radio star on several shows in the 1930s and 1940s,
including ``Showboat.'' He was known as the ``Troubadour of the
Moon'' on ``Hit Parade.''
   He appeared in several movies in the 1930s, including ``Melody
in Spring,'' ``College Rhythm,'' ``The Lady Objects'' and
``Gulliver's Travels.''
   Ross appeared with Irving Berlin and Bob Hope in shows overseas
during World War II, then starred in some of the early television
shows of the late 1940s.
   He later had a daily show on WCBS in New York, featuring
conversation, recordings and his own singing.
   He retired from regular appearances in the early 1970s, but
continued doing occasional shows, including a tour in 1980 with
Harry James called ``The Big Broadcast of 1937.''
   Ross, who was born in Seattle but grew up in New York City, was
a sprinter who was selected for the 1928 Olympic team, but chose
instead to tour Europe as leader and soloist of the Yale Glee Club.
   He was schooled at the Juilliard School and obtained a law
degree from Columbia University, but again he stayed with singing.
   Ross was married in 1935 to the former Olive White, who died in
1984. He is survived by his brother, who lives in Montrose, Pa.
   A memorial service was scheduled for May 13 at St. Bartholomew's
Church.

   An army truck hit a mine
southeast of the capital and 17 soldiers were killed, military
sources said Monday. They reported five soldiers were injured.
   The soldiers perished either in the explosion near Santa Maria
Ostuma, 40 miles southeast of the capital, or when the truck
crashed and burned, said the sources speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Col. Oscar Carranza gave a conflicting report to a radio station
of the deaths in La Paz province. He said the driver lost control
of the vehicle and it crashed, causing grenades carried by the
soldiers to explode.
   Officials in Soyopango, four miles east of San Salvador,
reported the finding of the bullet-riddled bodies of two people who
were taken from their homes Sunday night by men wearing army
uniforms.
   Amparo Montes, justice of the peace, said she identified the
bodies of Nicolasa Rivera Palacios, 77, and her son Juan Hector
Rivera, 45, who were killed by 38-caliber bullets. She said Mrs.
Rivera's body showed signs of rape.
   Juan Hector Rivera's wife Maria Leticia told reporters the
victims were taken from their home Sunday night by men in uniforms
who said they wanted the two to identify a captured guerrilla
suspect. She said she heard shots 90 minutes later.
   In a similar case 10 days ago in La Paz province, the bodies of
three slain men showed signs of torture.
   Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary archbishop of San Salvador, said
in his homily Sunday that the armed forces were responsible for the
three killings in La Paz. He said investigations by the church
Legal Aid office showed that the victims were taken from their
homes by men in army uniforms.
   Venceremos, the rebels' radio station, said Monday that
guerrilla fighters attacked a military post Saturday in Morazan, a
northeastern province, and caused ``many'' government casualties.
   The armed forces press office said three soldiers were killed
and 18 were wounded in Morazan. It did not mention guerrilla
casualties.

<TEXT>
   Panama's new foreign minister said Monday
his top priorities are normalizing relations with the United States
and persuading it to lift economic sanctions against his country.
   Jorge E. Ritter also said Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's
departure would not solve Panama's problems unless it was part of a
``national dialogue'' with the opposition.
   Noriega, commander of Panama's 15,000-member Defense Forces, has
rejected U.S. demands that he resign and leave the country.
Washington responded by imposing economic sanctions against Panama.
   Noriega, who controls Panama's civilian government, was indicted
in February by a federal grand jury in Florida that accused him of
being a drug trafficker.
   ``Let's suppose Gen. Noriega would leave today,'' Ritter said in
an interview. ``Would banks open immediately? No. Would all the
private companies go back in business? No. Would all the people who
lost their jobs because the U.S. froze Panamanian assest get their
jobs back? No.''
   Ritter, who described himself as a Noriega loyalist, had served
for the past 14 months as Panama's ambassador to the United
Nations. He was named foreign minister Sunday in a Cabinet shuffle,
replacing Jorge Abadia.
   Ritter is to return to Panama Tuesday.
   ``It is not in the interest of the United States or Panama to
keep this awkward relationship for long,'' he said in the interview.
   ``We have to get together and talk about it, but it's a very
complicated thing. I myself don't know exactly what's going to
happen.''
   He urged the Panamanian opposition to agree to a ``national
dialogue'' that he said could include negotiations for Noriega's
resignation.
   ``I think people are missing the point when they think Gen.
Noriega's departure is the final solution to Panama's crisis,'' he
said. ``We have to speak about the next elections. We have to speak
about the press that has been silenced. We have to talk about the
future of the economy.''
   Opposition leaders in March rejected what they called an
ill-defined offer of negotiations with the government, saying
Noriega must leave first.
   ``If that (Noriega's departure) is conceded from the beginning,
there is hardly anything that will bring Panamanians and the
government together for a dialogue,'' Ritter said. ``There cannot
be any preconditions for the dialogue.''

   Two teen-agers were killed in
clashes between police and separatists in violence following
weekend elections in this French Southwest Pacific territory,
police reported Tuesday.
   France's minister for overseas territories, Bernard Pons,
arrived in the archipelego late Sunday and told a news conference
that gendarmes had been ordered to ``return gunfire with gunfire.''
   The latest deaths bring to six the number of people killed in
five days.
   An 18-year-old Melanesian woman, Julie Akaro, was shot to death
Monday during a clash between gendarmes and militant separatists in
the eastern town of Canala, police headquarters in Noumea said.
   The privately owned radio station TUW said gendarmes and
separatists fired as the police were leaving their post.
   A 17-year-old boy of mixed race, shot Monday afternoon in a
confrontation in the west coast town of Houaylou, died early
Tuesday, police said.
   Separatists, most of them Melanesian, continued to hold hostage
16 police officers seized Friday on the island of Ouvea when
violence related to regional elections broke out and four gendarmes
were fatally wounded.
   Eleven other captive police officers were freed at dawn Monday
after tribal chiefs pressured the separatists.
   In Paris, Premier Jacques Chirac said on national television
that the 11 were liberated ``through the use of French army
forces.'' He indicted that efforts were under way to free the
others, but provided no details.
   Chirac called the captors ``terrorists'' and said they would be
tried and punished as such.
   President Francois Mitterrand asked that results in Sunday's
first round of the presidential elections in New Caledonia, held
simultaneously with regional elections, be canceled, a move Chirac
called a ``mean (political) maneuver.''
   Should the request be granted by the Constitutional Council, the
nation's highest legal body, it would not effect the overall
outcome of the French presidential election.
   Mitterrand's campaign headquarters said many polling stations in
New Caledonia had been closed because of threats of violence and
Mitterrand representatives ``were unable to control the regularity
of operations in the other stations.''
   The Socialist president won Sunday's balloting, but ranked
fourth in New Caledonia with 4.9 percent of the vote.
   Chirac, a conservative who placed second and will compete with
Mitterrand in second-round voting May 8, took 74.6 percent of the
New Caledonia vote.
   The separatists, known as Kanaks, boycotted the vote polls to
protest the new territorial assembly created by Chirac's government
over their objections.
   Native Melanesians make up 43 percent of the island group's
population of 145,000. Europeans comprise 36 percent of the
residents. The rest are mainly Asian or Tahitian. New Caledonia is
750 miles east of Australia.
   Pons told reporters that he had given orders that ``all those
who ... (attack authorities without provocation) or take part in
violent actions be neutralized.''
   Leopold Joredie, a leader of the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, called Pons' statement ``a declaration of
colonial war.''
   Violence began Friday with the storming of a police station on
Ouvea, 90 miles northeast of the capital of Noumea.
   Twenty-seven gendarmes were taken hostage and three of their
colleagues were hacked to death with machetes. A fourth gendarme
injured in the attack died in a Sydney, Australia, hospital Sunday.
   Three Melanesians were wounded.
   The kidnappers demanded the regional elections be canceled and
that police reinforcements be removed from the island. They also
demanded that negotiators be sent from Paris to discuss
independence for the island.
   ``We do not negotiate with terrorists and criminals,'' Pons
said. ``These terrorists will be treated as terrorists.''
   About 20 people were killed in 1984 violence that pitted Kanaks
against pro-French settlers.

<HEAD>Senate Begins Debate On Anti-Nuclear Weapons Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Monday began debating a
bill to ban nuclear weapons in the Philippines and to prohibit
nuclear-capable military ships from making port calls. The measure
is directed at U.S. military bases.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada, the main sponsor, said the proposed
Freedom from Nuclear Weapons Act would give the Philippine
government ``legal and moral authority to put (the United States)
on the defensive'' once it is approved by the 23-member Senate and
200-member House of Representatives.
   U.S. policy is to neither confirm nor deny the presence of
nuclear weapons on its warships or at the Clark Air Base and Subic
Naval Base. They are the two main American bases here, and Filipino
anti-nuclear activists claim they provide storage or transshipment
points for nuclear arms.
   ``Our best information ... is that there are nuclear weapons in
the bases and that is why we need to approve this legislation,''
said Tanada.
   The bill is expected to pass the Senate but to face strong
opposition in the lower house.
   Tanada said the measure would reaffirm a constitutional
provision that bans nuclear weapons from Philippine territory
``consistent with the national interest.''
   A draft of the proposal says ``peaceful uses of nuclear energy''
and commercial nuclear-powered ships would be excluded.
Nuclear-capable ships ``in distress'' would be allowed access to
Philippine waters for a limited duration and with the Philippine
president's permission.
   The bill proposes creation of a monitoring commission.
   Violators would face six years to life in prison, with
foreigners to be deported after serving their jail term.
   Also on Monday, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said Filipino
commanders should have access to all areas of the two large U.S-run
military bases, including rooms where sensitive messages are
decoded.
   The United States and the Philippines are reviewing the 1947
Military Bases Agreement, under which the Americans maintain six
military installations here.
   The current agreement expires in 1991.

   Emperor Hirohito held a rare news conference Monday
to talk of his health and his fabled past as the world's
longest-reigning monarch.
   The annual news conference, which will be broadcast Friday on
the emperor's 87th birthday, came as some Japanese already were
preparing for the death of the emperor.
   Medical equipment has been moved from a hospital on palace
grounds into Hirohito's living quarters so he can die at home, said
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Access to the living
area has been limited to close family members, they said.
   However, they said there was no indication his health is failing.
   Some newspaper have already chosen the words they will use to
announce his death.
   At Monday's news conference for 30 Japanese reporters, Hirohito
talked of World War II and its aftermath, said the sources. It has
been 13 years since his last news conference with foreign
reporters, when he denied planning the attack on Pearl Harbor but
left many other questions unanswered.
   On the throne since Dec. 25, 1926, Hirohito is especially known
for his role as Japan's wartime leader who was considered
semi-divine. He has ruled longer than any monarch alive.
   The emperor underwent surgery Sept. 22 after complaining of
weakness and nausea. Surgeons performed an intestinal bypass to
relieve pressure on the intestines caused by an enlargement of the
pancreas.
   Since then, Hirohito has resumed some duties, but 54-year-old
Crown Prince Akihito has taken an increasingly active role. Under
the constitution, Hirohito is a symbol of Japan, not a political
leader.
   Hirohito has been spending most of his time in the imperial
palace, a vast complex in the center of Tokyo. He has said he lives
like a bird in a cage.
   Three days a week, he goes into his office behind the grand
meeting hall for foreign dignitaries.
   Twenty times a year, the emperor holds religious ceremonies to
mark such occasions as equinoxes, the rice harvest, and his
birthday. Although he renounced his divinity at the end of World
War II, Hirohito still holds the position as the nation's
highest-ranking Shinto priest.
   Japanese feelings toward the emperor differ greatly among
generations.
   There is strong reverence among the elderly, who remember him
when he was believed to be a god. Their first duties as
schoolchildren during a fire were to remove the emperor's portrait.
   Younger people born after the start of Japan's rapid economic
growth tend to take less interest.

<TEXT>
   A man accused of embezzling $1.1
million from an Iowa credit union nearly five years ago was
arrested Monday by authorities who said they had grown suspicious
of his spending cash on a home and fancy cars.
   Steven Hadley, 40, was taken into custody without incident by
FBI agents and police in this city near Houston, the FBI said.
   Friendswood Police Lt. Gary Edwards recognized Hadley after
seeing his picture in a recent FBI flier issued in connection with
the television series ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' the FBI said.
   Hadley was reported missing by his wife in July 1983, the same
time the $1.1 million disappeared from the John Deere Employees
Credit Union in Waterloo, Iowa, where Hadley had worked.
   He left a note saying he could no longer cope with the pressures
of job and family.
   ``He's been here since 1984 when he bought a house, but has no
visible means of support,'' Edwards said.
   Hadley paid cash for the house and drove around town in a
Ferrari and an Alpha Romeo, which he also bought for cash, Edwards
said.
   ``We did a reverse investigation,'' Edwards said. ``We
researched how he came into a lot of money. When he bought his
house and fancy cars in cash, people were suspicious.''
   ``There was no doubt in my mind it was him when I saw the
flier,'' he said. ``I was shocked. I probably have 600 pages of
reports on this guy from the last three years and he looks the
same.''
   ``Hadley admitted his identity following his arrest,'' said
Nicholas V. O'Hara, FBI special agent in charge of the district
office at Omaha.
   Authorities believe that after his disappearance Hadley took a
July 21 flight to Chicago, but they were not able to track his
movements. He left behind a note to his family saying he took the
money and fled because he ``could no longer cope with home and work
pressures.''
   In part of the letter included in federal court documents,
Hadley wrote to his wife, ``This is a very difficult letter to
write but I couldn't let you find out from someone else first. If I
call you to read this letter, it means that I have successfully
left the state with around $1 million from the credit union.''
   Hadley had worked at the credit union for 10 years and was
described as a reliable and respected employee.
   His wife, Kathryn, has since divorced Hadley and retained
custody of their three children, ages 11, 7 and 1 when their father
disappeared.
   Hadley, who is charged in Iowa with credit union fraud and
embezzlement, is being held in Texas pending an appearance before a
U.S. magistrate.
   Hopes of catching Hadley rose in February when producers of the
``Unsolved Mysteries'' program arrived in Waterloo to prepare for a
segment on the missing cash and credit union employee.
   During the show, viewers are provided with a telephone number to
call if they can identify a photo of the subject.

   One of the Navy's last diesel-electric
submarines lay on the ocean's surface tied to a rescue vessel
Monday after a underwater explosions and a toxic fire injured 22
sailors and left three missing.
   The 30-year-old USS Bonefish, its remaining crew evacuated to
shore bases, floated alongside the submarine rescue ship USS Petrel
about 160 miles off Florida, said Lt. Cmdr. Aaron Long, a spokesman
at Atlantic Fleet headquarters in Norfolk.
   There was no apparent danger that the submarine, which carries
only conventional weapons, would sink, said Chief Petty Officer
Terry D. Borton, a fleet spokesman.
   It was not known if the missing men were aboard the sub or in
the water.
   Long said preliminary indications pointed toward a series of
explosions, including one in the battery compartment, but he said
he was unable to say precisely where the other explosions occurred
on the ship. The fire broke out in the forward battery compartment,
he said.
   The Charleston, S.C.-based USS Petrel arrived on the scene
Monday afternoon, but Navy officials said any decision to board the
submarine was being delayed until Tuesday.
   ``The decision made was that no one goes aboard'' until the
Petrel's experts declare the ship free of dangerous fumes Tuesday
morning, Long said.
   The Petrel, based in Charleston, S.C., was alongside the
submarine with a line attached to keep the submarine from drifting,
Long said.
   ``They are waiting until daybreak to commence any operation. No
one has boarded the vessel at this point,'' Long said.
   Also steaming to the scene was the salvage ship USS Hoist from
the Little Creek Amphibious Base in Norfolk.
   The explosion occurred Sunday afternoon in the boat's battery
compartment while the Bonefish was submerged on a routine training
mission, said Borton.
   The explosion triggered a fire that filled the 219-foot vessel
with smoke and toxic fumes. The sub surfaced and Cmdr. Mike Wilson,
the commander, ordered it evacuated.
   The frigate USS Carr, which also was in the training exercise,
took aboard 89 of the Bonefish's 92 crewmen. The McCloy, which also
was training nearby, reached the Bonefish before nightfall, the
Navy said.
   Also steaming to the scene and expected to arrive Tuesday was
the salvage ship USS Hoist from the Little Creek Amphibious Base in
Norfolk.
   The Bonefish was launched in 1958 from New York Shipbuilding in
Camden, N.J. It is powered on the surface by three 1,500-horsepower
diesel engines that drive a single propeller and charge batteries.
While submerged, the batteries power two electric motors.
   The Bonefish and its two sister ships, the Barbel and Blueback,
are among the last of the Navy's diesel-electric submarines and are
used principally to mimic Soviet submarines in training exercises.
The Soviets still operate about 100 diesel-electric boats.
   The Bonefish is the second Navy vessel to bear that name. The
first, a World War II submarine, disappeared in the Sea of Japan in
June 1945 while on combat patrol.
   The 22 injured were transferred to the aircraft carrier John F.
Kennedy, which steamed to Mayport, Fla. From there they were flown
to the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville. The other crewmen were taken
to Mayport by the Carr and flown to the Charleston Air Force Base,
where they arrived Monday afternoon.
   Atlantic Fleet headquarters said two sailors were seriously
injured, but the nature and extent of their injuries was not
immediately available.
   The majority of the sailors disembarked from the Carr in Mayport
wearing blue overalls and sneakers, though many were shoeless.
   Reporters were not allowed to talk to the crewmen when they
returned to Charleston. They looked grim as they walked across the
tarmac to meet about 30 waiting relatives. One woman wore a jacket
reading ``Diesel Boats Forever'' beneath a cartoon of a submarine.
   One Bonefish sailor aboard a bus awaiting transport back to the
Navy base was asked if he and his shipmates were alright.
   ``Yes, thank God for that,'' said the unidentified crewman. He
refused to comment about conditions on the boat during the fire.
   The Navy identified the missing men as Lt. Ray Everts of Naoma,
W.Va., Petty Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr. of Willis,
Texas, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren of Pisgah
Forest, N.C.

<HEAD>LA Most Dangerous, Dallas-Fort Worth Safest, Newspaper Poll Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pilots responding to a survey on airport safety
rated Los Angeles International the most dangerous in the nation
and Dallas-Fort Worth International the safest, it was reported
Monday.
   However, many of the pilots said the main factor governing
airport safety is people, and that can vary at any facility at any
time, according to the survey, conducted by The Atlantic
Constitution.
   The newspaper in February and March polled 2,200 pilots who hold
air transportation certificates, asking them to list in no
particular order the five safest and least safest airports.
   The newspaper, reporting the survey results in its Monday
editions, said 1,360 pilots responded. The report did not include
how many times a particular airport was named and did not list
additional airports.
   In addition to Los Angeles International, the airports listed as
the five least safe were Washington's National, New York's
LaGuardia, Chicago's O'Hare and, in a tie, San Diego's Lindbergh
Field and Denver's Stapleton International.
   In addition to the Texas airport, listed among the five safest
facilities were O'Hare, Hartsfield-Atlanta International,
Washington's Dulles and Seattle@Tacoma.
   Many pilots, in written comments, said it was difficult to rate
airports for safety.
   ``It depends on the people,'' wrote a Continental pilot. ``These
constantly change. So an airport that could be labeled unsafe today
might not be tomorrow.''
   A Trans World Airlines pilot said, ``It can be compared to the
question, `Where is the safest place to drive a car?' Texas has
great long and wide roads (that are) well lit. But you better watch
out because an animal or human with a gun might ruin your whole
day. The key is pilot complacency.''
   But quite a few pilots had gripes about specific airports. Some
of the harshest criticism was reserved for Washington's National,
where pilots expressed displeasure with that airport's noise
abatement procedures and the ban on flying over national monuments.
   National's noise rules require them to cut power on takeoff
while performing relatively tricky maneuvers at uncomfortably low
altitudes.
   ``This is particularly a consideration when aircraft are
departing for long flights and may be loaded to or near maximum
allowable weight,'' wrote a Pan Am pilot with 22 years' experience.
``Power loss in conjunction with low-altitude maneuvering and even
minimal wind shear or turbulence could be disastrous.''
   The rule about national monuments makes pilots take awkward
routes in and out of the airport, poll returns said.
   National, the airport of choice for Congressmen and lobbyists,
remains open ``only ... for political convenience,'' one pilot said.
   Los Angeles International also drew the ire of many respondents.
Among the problems at that airport, pilots said, was its varied mix
of small planes and jumbo jets.
   ``Any airport that mixes light aircraft and commercial jet
aircraft is less safe in direct proportion to the number of light
aircraft using the facility,'' one pilot wrote. ``Light aircraft
are difficult to see and often do not show up on air traffic
control radar.''
   Chicago's O'Hare stood out for making both the five-safest and
five-most dangerous lists. It received praise from several pilots
for its controllers' ability to deal well with the combined
pressures of heavy traffic and winter storms.
   To get to LaGuardia, pilots must run the gantlet between Newark
and Kennedy airports, both within 15 miles.
   ``That can make approaches kind of dicey,'' one pilot wrote.
LaGuardia also has strict noise-abatement rules similar to those at
National.
   The paper printed no specific comments on either the San Diego
or Denver airports.

<TEXT>
   Britain on Monday announced its approval of a
$37.4 billion jet fighter project involving four European nations.
   Britain was the first to declare its support of the European
Fighter Aircraft. No final decisions have been made by the
governments of West Germany, Italy and Spain.
   Defense Secretary George Younger told Parliament the British
decision still depends on agreement by the three other countries.
   The first of the 800 aircraft are to be in service in 1996.
   British officials expect the defense ministers of the four
countries will approve the project at a meeting in Hanover, West
Germany, on May 11.
   Under a preliminary accord signed in September, Britain and West
Germany each will pay one-third of the cost, Italy 21 percent and
Spain 13 percent.
   Britain and West Germany are to each order 250 of the warplanes,
with the first to come into service in 1996.
   The estimated cost of each jet will be $49 million, and some
West German critics say that is too much.
   Younger said the European Fighter Aircraft ``will fulfill a
vital defense need in the best and most cost-effective way. It will
continue the trend of successful European collaboration in
aerospace (and) it will ensure that our industry remains in the
forefront of this technology to the end of the century and beyond.''
   Denzil Davies, the opposition Labor Party's defense spokesman,
expressed relief that ``on this occasion at least the government
has been forced'' to agree to European rather than American
technology.
   In 1986, Britain scrapped its own surveillance-plane system that
had cost millions of dollars and ordered instead Airborne Warning
and Control (AWACs) aircraft produced by the Seattle-based Boeing
Co.
   The European Fighter Aircraft is among the projects on which the
United States and its European allies are supposed to share
information to avoid duplication in developing technology.

Rights Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former Argentine general facing
extradition has been ordered to pay $21 million to a lawyer who was
held four years without charges and tortured repeatedly in a prison
run by the general's soldiers.
   The judgment against Carlos Suarez Mason, made public Monday, is
the largest known damage award by a U.S. District Court for human
rights abuses, said Joanne Hoeper, a lawyer for plaintiff Horacio
Martinez-Baca.
   Suarez Mason, commander of the First Army Corps in Buenos Aires
from 1976 to 1979, during a period of military rule, ``directed a
pattern and practice of terror against the general population of
Argentina,'' said the ruling by U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti.
   Suarez Mason, a fugitive from Argentina who is being held
without bail during extradition proceedings, never submitted a
response to the civil suit, refused to answer pretrial questions
and was held in default by Conti.
   Suarez Mason has insisted he has no money after spending his
last $100,000 on lawyers for his extradition case. Ray Archuleta, a
lawyer who sought to represent Suarez Mason in the civil suit did
not return a reporter's calls.
   Suarez Mason, 64, fled Argentina after a civilian government
came to power in 1983. He was arrested in January 1987 at his home
in Foster City, south of San Francisco, after Argentina located him
and requested his extradition.
   Another judge is scheduled to rule Wednesday on Argentina's
attempt to extradite him on charges of 43 murders and 24
kidnappings, allegedly committed by soldiers under his command.
   Martinez-Baca's suit is one of three filed in the San Francisco
federal court by former Argentinians who say they were tortured, or
their relatives killed, by soldiers under Suarez Mason's
supervision.
   U.S. courts have allowed civil suits against foreigners in their
jurisdiction for violations of internationally recognized human
rights, such as torture and summary execution.
   Martinez-Baca, a labor union lawyer and former local government
official in Mendoza, Argentina, said he was arrested in March 1976,
six days after a military coup, and tortured several times before
his release in April 1980. He said Suarez Mason once intervened
personally to block his release.
   The damages can be collected against any of Suarez Mason's
assets that Martinez-Baca and his lawyers can find. Ms. Hoeper said
she was skeptical about Suarez Mason's claim of poverty.
   ``This is someone who is alleged to have taken many millions of
dollars when he was in a position of power in Argentina,'' she
said. ``He paid his attorneys $100,000 in wire transfers from
Argentina and we're sure there's more where that came from.''
   Martinez-Baca, who lives in Oakland and works in a law office,
said he doubted he would ever collect all the money. He said he
would donate half of anything he gets to a fund for victims of
human rights abuses in Argentina.

   A factory in Odessa is planning to convert
platforms used to transport SS-20 missiles into building cranes as
the weapons are dismantled under a U.S.-Soviet arms control treaty,
Tass reported Monday.
   The official news agency said the first missile platform has
arrived at the Odessa Heavy Lifter Factory in the Ukrainian
republic. Soviet engineers have designed an 80-ton crane will be
mounted on the former missile chassis, Tass said.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a
teaty last December to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.
   The Soviet Union began pulling its SS-20 missiles out of Eastern
Europe earlier this year, although neither the Soviet Union nor the
United States has yet ratified the treaty.

   President Mato Andric of the
Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina on Monday withdrew his
candidacy for a new term in office after being implicated in a
major financial scandal, Tanjug news agency said.
   Andric was the only candidate and would have been formally
elected at a session of the Bosnian Parliament on April 27.
   On Sunday the official Bosnian youth organization criticized
Andric for his part in a scandal in which the Bosnian
food-processing firm Agrokomerc last year issued uncovered
promissory notes worth about $1 billion.
   The scandal is the worst in Yugoslav history and led to the
resignation and replacement of other Bosnian officials.
   The youth organization said it would not support Andric because
of several ``economic and political flaws'' that occurred in the
republic during his term, including the Agrokomerc scandal.

   Signs of thawing in U.S.-Soviet relations are
giving a measure of hope to some people in the strife-torn Middle
East, The Associated Press' chief correspondent there said Monday.
   ``They hope that there is a spinoff there for the Middle East,''
said Nick Tatro, the AP's chief of bureau in Jerusalem. ``We see in
the Middle East a certain loss of hope, a very negative type of
atmosphere,'' he said.
   Tatro and four other AP executives and correspondents discussed
the situation in their areas in a conversation with AP President
Louis D. Boccardi during the AP's annual meeting here Monday.
   Also participating in the discussion, called ``The World's
Hotspots: A Firsthand View,'' were Bryna Brennan, correspondent in
Central America; Terence P. Hunt, chief White House correspondent;
Michael Putzel, chief of bureau, Moscow; and Barry Renfrew, chief
of bureau, Seoul.
   The failure of Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Secretary Eduard Shevardnadze to find a breakthrough on
arms control ``makes it sure that arms control will not be the
centerpiece'' of the upcoming summit between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, said Putzel.
   Despite that, Reagan's staff will be looking for a big public
relations gain for the president, Hunt said.
   ``Unless the president stumbles badly, there is always a bounce
that comes out of the summit,'' he said.
   Reagan will address the Soviet people and a group of Soviet
students during the May summit and will stress that if Gorbachev is
sincere about giving the Soviet people more freedoms, he should
grant them passports to travel freely and ease the restrictions on
the literature they can read, Hunt said.
   Renfrew said South Korea was hoping for success is hosting the
summer Olympics.
   ``They hope the Olympics will launch the country on the path cut
out for themselves as a second Japan,'' he said.
   However, North Korea's potential for violeance cannot be
underestimated, he said, and the North could engage in a major
provocation and interrupt the Olympics, he said.
   Brennan said wars in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua were
``essentially civil wars which started as reaction to poverty and
land distribution, which was completely unfair.''

<HEAD>Black Labor Federation Angered By Threatened Wage Freeze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This nation's main black labor
federation warned Monday of ``anger and confrontation'' if
President P.W. Botha fulfills a threat to impose wage controls in
the private sector.
   ``The government underestimates just how sensitive an issue
wages is,'' said Frank Meintjies, spokesman for the Congress of
South African Trade Unions. ``We completely reject the state
president's plans to impose a general wage freeze.''
   Meintjies said Botha may feel he can curb wages because black
workers have no vote, ``but he will have to deal with other
consequences _ the anger and confrontation of millions of workers
crucially located at the point of production.''
   The government imposed a wage freeze for public employees
earlier this year as part of its campaign to curb the current 13.4
percent annual inflation rate. This drew bitter protests from white
teachers and railway workers, among others.
   Botha complained last week in Parliament that the private sector
was not holding down salaries and said legislation was being
drafted to force wage and price restraints. He said private
employers were envisioning wage increases in the range of 15
percent.
   ``The reaction thus far from the private sector has been
disappointing,'' Botha said. ``It is becoming increasingly clear
that this quid pro quo will not come about by means of persuasion
or voluntary teamwork. Other mechanisms will have to be found.''
   Major business organizations expressed concern about Botha's
statement. The chairman of a nationwide grocery store chain
defended his company's recent decision to grant wage increases of
up to 25 percent to the predominantly black work force.
   ``The bigger increases were confined to the most needy in the
lower income groups,'' said Raymond Ackerman of Pick 'n Pay. ``If
we did not negotiate the recent increases in a responsible fashion
... we would have faced strikes which would have been far more
costly in the long run.''
   Mentjies said that if the government sought wage restraints, it
``should start by cutting salaries fo government ministers,
directors and shareholders.''
   ``The working class does not want to pay for the disasters of
apartheid's political and economic system,'' Meintjies said.
``Employers will have to decide whether they will be browbeaten or
use their clout to oppose the wage freeze.''
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which claims 750,000
members, was the target of a government decree on Feb. 25 barring
it from political activities. The federation, which has taken a
militant and active stance against apartheid, is scheduled to hold
a national assembly this weekend to discuss the ban.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Britain Says It Could Not Land Troops in Non-Nuclear Denmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary George Younger said Monday that
if fellow NATO member Denmark adopts a policy of forcing visiting
ships to say if they are carrying nuclear arms, Britain will not be
able to land troops there.
   ``If we cannot send ships into that situation we clearly would
not physically be able to deliver 13,500 British troops of the U.K.
Mobile Force on site without ships to transport them,'' Younger
told a luncheon for foreign correspondents.
   Denmark's conservative Prime Minister Poul Schlueter has called
an election for May 10 in a showdown with left-of-center foes over
the nuclear issue and its effect on the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Schlueter heads a minority coalition government. He called the
election rather than implement a parliamentary vote that could have
forced visiting warships to declare if they had nuclear arms.
   The United States and Britain both refuse, as a matter of
policy, to say if their warships carry nuclear arms.
   Denmark is a key NATO country geographically. Britain is
supposed to land reinforcements there as part of the defense
strategy of the Western alliance.
   Privately, British officials have expressed concern that if
Denmark insists on a nuclear arms declaration, Norway, Greece and
Spain, other NATO members with strong anti-nuclear sentiments,
might follow suit.
   Britain and the United States have already stopped visits to New
Zealand, a non-NATO member, because it insists that ships disclose
the presence of nuclear arms on board.
   ``We and our American allies have a very firm policy that we
never confirm or deny that any of our ships has nor has not got
nuclear weapons on board,'' said Younger. ``It would be valuable
information to the outside world to know either that they have or
have not.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reverses Ruling on Documents in Teamsters Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Monday threw out a
lower court's order requiring government prosecutors to share
secret documents with lawyers for indicted Teamsters President
Jackie Presser.
   Presser's defense has claimed that the government documents
would prove his innocence.
   But a three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously agreed that Presser and two Teamsters union
co-defendants had no constitutional right of access to the
documents, overturning a ruling last year by U.S. District Judge
George White in Cleveland.
   Federal prosecutors argued that they should be permitted to keep
the documents confidential until Presser and co-defendants Harold
Friedman and Anthony Hughes, fellow officers of Cleveland's
Teamsters Local 507, went on trial.
   The trial is scheduled for July 12 in White's court. The three
defendants were charged in a May 1986 indictment with arranging a
$700,000 payroll-padding scheme that put ``ghost employees'' on the
payroll of Local 507.
   Presser, 60, is secretary-treasurer of Local 507 as well as
president of the 1.6 million-member Teamsters union.
   The defense has argued that the documents would show that
Presser and the other defendants were serving as government
informants and that the FBI had authorized the payroll-padding
scheme.
   ``In essence, the district court concluded ... that the defense
has a constitutional right to know the tactical strengths and
weaknesses of the government's case against it,'' appeals Judge
Danny Boggs wrote for the 6th Circuit court.
   ``The Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution creates
such a right and we do not believe that it exists,'' Boggs wrote.
   Defense lawyer John Climaco, contacted through his Cleveland
office, said he was unaware of the ruling and declined immediate
comment.

<TEXT>
   An Italian priest said Monday he
was held for 26 hours by rebels in northern Nicaragua for
denouncing ``crimes of the Contras.''
   Ubaldo Gervasoni, 43, said Contra rebels abducted him on April
19 in El Algodon, about 125 miles northeast of Managua in Zelaya
province.
   In an interview, the Roman Catholic priest said he had been
threatened previously by Contra leaders in the region for having
condemned ``assassinations and kidnappings by the Contras.''
   Gervasoni has been based since January in nearby Waslala, on the
border with Matagalpa state.
   He said that the day before his abduction, three peasants were
kidnapped from a local church by the U.S.-backed rebels.
   One of them, Neris Robles, was found dead the next day, he said.
   ``They cut his throat,'' the priest said, adding that the
whereabouts of the other two peasants was not known.
   ``Although they did not mistreat me physically and I was given
food during my abduction of 26 hours, they kept me closed in the
chapel of a church and sealed the doors with barbed wire,'' he said.
   ``They also threatened to send me to Honduras for the (Contra)
high command to judge me,'' he said. ``They accused me of political
activity and of being with the Sandinistas, but my mission is
apostolic and I denounced abuses on both sides.''
   He said the rebels released him to another parish priest,
Enrique Blandon, and a group of parishioners in El Algodon. Blandon
had been held by the rebels for 10 days in January.
   The leftist Sandinistas and Contras, who have used bases in
Honduras, have fought for nearly seven years. They signed a
temporary truce March 23.
   Gervasconi said there are many rebels in the region where he
works and that the Sandinista army has withdrawn in the past month.
   A 60-day cease-fire went into effect on April 1.
   ``Since that date you don't hear the sounds of combat and
campesinos are confident that peace can be reached. Many of them
are optimistic and are preparing to plant this winter,'' he said.

   Voters on Tuesday cast ballots for the
National Assembly in an election the governing Democratic Justice
Party was expected to win over a divided opposition.
   A few hours after the polls opened at 7 a.m. (6 p.m. EDT
Monday), election officials said voting was progressing smoothly in
fine spring weather. Police were on full alert.
   The polls close at 6 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT Tuesday) and most results
were expected to be known within hours. About 26.2 million people
were registered to vote.
   At 9 a.m., election officials reported a 9.5 percent voter
turnout, compared to 9.3 percent during the same period in the Dec.
16 presidential election.
   Despite the unexpectedly strong early turnout, election
officials predicted the overall voting rate would not be high.
   Newspapers had predicted a turnout lower than the 89 percent in
December balloting and 84 percent in the last parliamentary
election in February 1985.
   The Democratic Justice Party of President Roh Tae-woo, who won
the December election with 36 percent of the vote, was expected to
win a majority in the 299-seat National Assembly with less than
half of the popular vote.
   As in December, a split in the opposition vote was expected to
help the governing party.
   Each side has accused the other of fomenting violence, and
opposition leaders say more trouble may follow if people feel
Tuesday's elections are rigged.
   Police fired tear gas Monday at about 1,500 students who
protested in two cities. Authorities reported 90 cases of
election-related violence during he 18-day campaign, with more than
150 people detained and 77 formally charged.
   Scores have been injured, but no exact count was available. At
least 20 injuries were reported Monday.
   Press reports said 145,000 national police were on full alert
with 55,000 assigned to the 13,812 polling stations.
   Roh's party says it provides the stability necessary for
continued eonomic progress and the democratic reforms he has
promised.
   The opposition, whose divisiveness cost it the advantage gained
through widespread anti-government protests last summer, says
victory by the Democratic Justice Party means one-party
dictatorship.
   Opposition leaders also have attacked the governing party about
an embezzlement scandal in which former President Chun Doo-hwan's
younger brother has been arrested.
   A few dozen of the 224 single-member election districts are seen
as opposition strongholds, but many others have one government
candidate running against two rivals from the opposition.
   Spokesman for Democratic Justice say they hope to win about 125
districts, along with about 38 of the 75 seats to be awarded on the
basis of a party's share of the vote nationwide.
   It held 160 of the 276 seats in the last National Assembly,
chosen in 1985.
   Under a new constitution that took effect in February, when Roh
began his five-year term, the new assembly will serve for four
years and has the power to investigate government actions. The
president no longer can dissolve it.
   Opposition and government parties have traded charges of
vote-buying and the South Korean press has reported widespread
irregularities.
   Chai Mun-shik, chairman of the Democratic Justice Party, said in
a statement Monday that candidate Kwon Joong-dong was expelled
after prosecutors displayed 1,345 envelopes, each containing 20,000
won ($27) and campaign leaflets for Kwon.
   Chai apologized to the nation for Kwon's ``betrayal of party
principles of fair elections.''
   Supporters of the opposition said they found thousands of the
envelopes Sunday night at a post office in Andong, south of Seoul.
   Prosecutors later ordered the arrests of two ruling party
supporters in Andong on charges of trying to buy votes for Kwon
with about 85 million won ($114,865) found in 4,296 envelopes at a
post office, the Korean news agency Yonhap reported.
   Police said they had detained 173 people in connection with
non-violent violations of election law and formally charged 120.
Actions involved include tearing down or pasting over election
posters and producing allegedly slanderous campaign leaflets.
   Firebombs and rocks have been thrown at campaign rallies and
political party offices. Supporters of rival candidates have fought
in the streets over such things as the content of campaign leaflets
and placement or removal of posters.

<NOTE>Eds: New grafs 1-13 UPDATE with banks to resume some suspended

<TEXT>
   The National Banking Commission said
Monday that Panama's banks could immediately resume offering a
dozen services that had been suspended following U.S. actions
directed against this nation's economy.
   The services include handling letters of credit, collecting
outstanding loans and transferring funds within the country.
   The commission called resumption of the 12 services ``an
important and decisive step in the gradual and ordered process''
toward normal banking operations.
   The nation's banks closed March 4 because there was not enough
cash to cover withdrawals. Some banks reopened last week, but only
to accept deposits.
   Panama's civilian chief executive, Manuel Solis Palma, met
earlier Monday with new Cabinet members and other advisers in a
renewed effort to find a way out of the deepening financial and
political crisis.
   Solis Palma named seven new ministers to the 12-member Cabinet
on Sunday night, three of them to sensitive posts in foreign and
economic policy.
   He said the chief task would be to achieve full resumption of
banking services.
   Several diplomats and other observers said privately the new
ministers appeared to be technocrats without sharply defined
political leanings. Solis Palma, considered to be a leftist, said
he had no plans to interfere with private business or industry.
   He said he is willing to talk with opponents, but not if they
continue demanding the resignation of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
who commands the military and police and has the real power in
Panama.
   ``What we will not do is surrender before the start of battle,''
the acting president said.
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug
trafficking charges, accusations which he denies. The Reagan
administration has been trying to oust him since since last summer,
applying a series of sanctions that have paralyzed the economy.
   Jorge E. Ritter, Panama's new foreign minister, said Monday in
an interview at the United Nations in New York that his top
priorities are normalizing relations with the United States and
persuading it to lift its economic sanctions against Panama.
   Ritter, scheduled to return to Panama on Tuesday, had served as
U.N. ambassador for the past 14 months.
   In Washington, an opposition leader said a group of Panamanian
dissidents is planning a military operation against Noriega by next
week.
   Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, who has remained loyal to ousted
President Eric Arturo Delvalle, told reporters the group is made up
of very knowledgeable officers who have many friends in the
Panamanian Defense Forces, which Noriega commands.
   Sosa gave no details, but the group apparently includes
high-ranking defectors who went to the United States soon after
Noreiga deposed Delvalle on Feb. 26.
   Solis Palma said the first task of his new education minister
would be to dismantle what he called the National Council of
Rumors. The latest rumors had said his new appointees would be
leftist ideologues.
   ``We are a capitalist group being attacked by other
capitalists,'' Solis Palma told a news conference soon after
introducing his new Cabinet members. He also rejected earlier
reports in state-run newspapers that called his new team a ``war
cabinet.''
   The new ministers replace officials Solis Palma inherited when
he replaced Delvalle. The National Assembly, dominated by Noriega's
supporters, ousted Delvalle a day after he tried to dismiss Noriega
as commander of the Defense Forces.
   Solis Palma's title is minister in charge of the presidency.

<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot on Monday said
the United States had declined as a leader in world affairs and
that business leaders, not politicians, are to blame.
   Since the U.S. economy depends on tax-paying workers, business
leaders should work harder to create more jobs, Perot said.
   Perot, a 57-year-old businessman and philanthropist who in 1978
financed the rescue of two employees held hostage in Iran, was
keynote speaker at the Associated Press Annual Luncheon held here
Monday.
   The luncheon was held on the first day of the 102nd Annual
Convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association. More
than 2,000 people are attending the three-day convention.
   Perot said the country's decline began after World War II.
   ``We were complacent and arrogant'' after the war, he said. ``We
gave it away at a time when we had an incredible edge.
   ``We've become a people who want to feel good now, at any cost,
and let tomorrow take care of itself,'' he said. ``We and not the
elected officials are the dwarfs and the wimps.''
   Perot said other countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific
region, are outpacing the United States in education, trade and
technology.
   He said that before the federal government can cure the huge
budget deficit, individual Americans must learn not to spend more
than they earn.
   ``The greatest nation in the history of civilization has given
up trying to live within its means,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Government prosecutors said Monday
they will oppose a bid to reopen the trial of the ``Sharpeville
Six,'' a group of blacks convicted of complicity in a mob killing
and sentenced to death.
   P.J. Van Zyl, registrar of the Pretoria Supreme Court, said the
attorney general of Transvaal province had filed a notice of
intention to oppose the defense lawyers' application to reopen the
trial. He said a ruling was expected May 3.
   The defendants, five men and a woman, were granted a stay of
execution on March 17, the day before they were scheduled to be
hanged. The stay was ordered after their lawyers filed papers
claiming a key state witness had been coerced by police into giving
false testimony.
   Defense lawyers asked that the trial be reopened to consider
that claim and to review the credibility of other state witnesses.
   Many human rights organizations and Western leaders have
appealed to South Africa's white-controlled government to commute
the death sentences.
   The six were convicted of complicity in the September 1984
killing of a black municipal councilor, Kuzwayo Dhlamini, during
riots against rent increases in the black township of Sharpeville,
south of Johannesburg.
   But they were not found guilty of physically contributing to
Dhlamini's death. They were convicted under the doctrine of common
purpose, which holds defendants responsible if they are found to be
participants in mob violence.
   The government has said their conduct inluded throwing stones at
Dhlamini, helping set his house afire and slapping a woman who
begged the crowd not to burn him.
   Black government employees frequently are targets of militants
battling to overthrow the government and its policy of apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Row Between Greece, Turkey Blocks EEC Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A row over Cyprus on Monday between Greek and
Turkish officials led to cancellation of a European Economic
Community meeting, according to diplomats.
   ``This is a very serious matter,'' said one diplomat after an
announcement that the Turkey-EEC Association meeting was called off.
   An EEC official, who like the diplomats spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Turkish delegation refused to take part in the
meeting as a protest of the agenda's mentioning the Turkish
occupation of Cyprus.
   He said the Turkish delegation agreed to discuss political
cooperation with the Community over dinner, but would not attend
the talks themselves.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany failed
to resolve the problem after more than three hours of closed-door
negotiations and postponed the meeting indefinitely.
   Genscher spokesman Hans-Jurgen Chroborg said West Germany, which
holds the rotating EEC presidency until the end of June, hopes to
reschedule the meeting before its term expires.
   Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz, the Turkish delegation chief, was
angered over Greece's insistence on including the Turkish
occupation of northern Cyprus in the EEC statement adopted by the
Community's foreign ministers earlier Monday.
   The statement said Ankara's occupation of the east Mediterranean
island has a ``bearing'' on the Community's relations with Turkey.
   The Community went into the meeting with a broad declaration
``taking note'' of Turkey's desire to improve relations with the
12-nation Common Market.
   Turkey wanted the talks to help release a long-frozen EEC
development credit of $748 million. It also wanted a discussion of
the free movement of Turkish workers in the Community and the
removal of restrictions on Turkish imports.
   EEC financial aid to Turkey was frozen since the military coup
in Turkey in 1980.
   Despite a recent thaw in its relations with Turkey, Greece said
last week it would block the funding until Turkish troops were
withdrawn from Cyprus. It also said it wants improved treatment of
the Greek minority in Turkey.
   Turkish military forces invaded northern Cyprus in July 1974 and
a Turkish federated state of Cyprus was set up after Ankara said
the Turkish Cypriot minority there was threatened following a
military coup in Greece.
   Greek Cypriots outnumber Turkish Cypriots on the island by more
than four to one.

   A 4-month-old baby taken from a hospital was
found safe Monday, and a woman authorities said had impersonated a
relative to gain access to the child was charged with kidnapping.
   LaShae Cherry, taken Saturday from Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, was found at a house in north Philadelphia after
several tipsters called the FBI.
   ``It's just like a miracle to me,'' the baby's mother,
18-year-old Faye Cherry, said at a news conference at the hospital.
``She started smiling and everything.''
   Cherylle Staley, 21, was charged with kidnapping, criminal
trespass, unlawful restraint, interference with custody of a child
and recklessly endangering another person, police Capt. Robert
Deeds said.
   She was expected to be arraigned later Monday night or early
Tuesday, Deeds said.
   A man who was at the home when the baby was found was not
charged, police said.
   Authorities said Ms. Staley carried the baby out the hospital
Saturday after she impersonated an aunt. The baby, dressed in new
clothes, was recovered without incident.
   FBI assistant special agent Dick Ross said his office received
several calls about a woman claiming to have had a baby, ``and this
was found to be rather unbelievable (to callers) and this was
reported to us.''
   Ross, asked about a motive, said ``there was some feeling of
having to produce a child.''
   A doctor at the hospital said the baby was returned wearing
clean clothes and apparently had been bathed recently.
   ``She received good care over the last 50 hours,'' said Dr.
Leonard Friedland, pediatrician on duty in the hospital's emergency
room when LaShae was brought in.
   LaShae sat quietly during the press conference, gurgling and
sucking on her fist.
   ``As soon as she saw me she just laughed,'' Ms. Cherry said.
   She said she had become convinced Sunday night her baby had been
sold by the woman who took her.
   LaShae had been at the hospital since April 18 for treatment of
pneumonia and diarrhea, according to hospital officials. She was
scheduled to be released Saturday.

   Actress Raquel Welch called Yves Montand ``a
spectacular film personality'' as the Film Society of Lincoln
Center paid tribute Monday night to the French actor.
   ``For Americans, especially American women, he is France,'' Miss
Welch said during the ceremonies in Avery Fisher Hall. ``He's a
spectacular film personality and about the most seductive singer in
the world.''
   Director Louis Malle called Montand ``one of the most romantic
figures the French cinema has ever known,'' adding: ``He represents
something unique in the French cultural world. Throughout his life
as a performer he has worked hard to avoid cliche.''
   Other speakers included Claude Berri, who directed Montand in
his two most recent films, ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of the
Spring,'' and Costa-Gavras, Montand's director in ``Z,'' ``The
Confession,'' ``State of Siege,'' ``Clair de Femme'' and ``The
Sleeping Car Murders.''
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said of Montand, ``He's a superb film
actor, concert artist and, had he wanted to, could have been the
president of France.''
   Montand is the 17th recipient of a Film Society of Lincoln
Center tribute, the first from France. Charles Chaplin received the
first tribute in 1972, followed by Fred Astaire and Alfred
Hitchcock. Last year's honoree was Sir Alec Guinness.
   Montand said he remembered himself at 11, working in a factory
outside Marseilles, then using money he earned to see American
movies with subtitles.
   ``The 66-year-old boy is here tonight having a tribute. If you
can imagine what is going on here (pointing to his heart), you
understand that words are too weak and too futile.''
   The gala evening, which concluded with a dinner at the Tavern on
the Green, benefitted the society's fall New York Film Festival.

   Education Secretary William J. Bennett says
American schools ``have begun the long climb back,'' but the nation
is ``still at risk'' from an academic system rife with mediocrity
and resistant to change.
   Bennett's assessment is contained in a follow-up report
requested by President Reagan for the fifth anniversary of a biting
critique of U.S. education that was called ``A Nation At Risk.''
   He says American teenagers are taking more math, science and
advanced placement courses, and scoring somewhat higher on
college-entrance and other tests.
   But ``curricular foolishness has not been eliminated from
American high schools,'' he said, and the schools ``are still much

   Two years after the Chernobyl power station was
the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident, nepotism, sloppy
repairs and drunkenness are rampant at the facility, Pravda charged.
   The problems cited by the Communist Party daily were similar to
those the government blamed for an explosion and fire at the plant
on April 26, 1986.
   Last July, three officials in charge of the plant during the
accident were convicted of gross negligence and sentenced to 10
years in a labor camp.
   Pravda said on Sunday that during the last two years engineering
jobs at the plant have been handed out to medics, teachers,
veterinarians and people without any higher education.
   It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to ``resolve at
any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant
``to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of
extremely intricate equipment.''

   A deeply split Supreme Court said Monday it
will consider throwing out a key civil rights decision used to

   By a 5-4 vote, the justices took the unusual step of expanding
the scope of a North Carolina racial-harassment case to consider
limiting the ability of minorities to sue private citizens for
monetary damages.
   Critics said the announcement could have a major psychological

   There won't be any elephants but there will be a
cast of 600 performing for an arena seating 15,000 people in this
summer's ``Aida'' extravaganza at Earl's Hall.
   It is the largest opera setting ever in Britain. The cavernous
hall, also used for ice shows and pop concerts, covers 12 acres and
was the largest reinforced concrete building in Europe when it was
built in 1937.
   Its seating capacity is six times greater than the Royal Opera
House in Covent Garden, and ticket prices at $40 and $47.50 are
about half the price of good seats at the opera house.
   Public fascination with Giuseppe Verdi's opera, first performed
in Cairo in 1871, abounds.
   ``The tickets are going so well that we have extended the run
from six nights to seven,'' said Lilian Hochhauser, who with her
husband, Victor, heads one of three groups of impresarios who got
together to stage ``Aida'' at Earl's Court near Kensington in west
London.
   The triumphal procession in ``Aida'' has included elephants in
some productions but animals were turned down for Earl's Court.
   ``Elephants in Egypt are totally, historically inaccurate, and
camels were not originally known there either,'' Mrs. Hochhauser
said. ``Everybody wants animals but I think perhaps it's better not
to start.''
   Asked about a newspaper report that the impresarios expect a $2
million profit, she said, ``Nothing like that, and you can say I
laughed hysterically.''
   She also declined to say how much the production would cost.
   ``We don't know what to expect because production costs have
risen so enormously. This is unknown territory. There's never been
an opera at Earl's Court before and never one in Britain on this
scale,'' she said.
   ``I think there are thousands of people who are intrigued by
opera and would like to hear one. But they are put off by the price
and the lower-cost seats always sell out quickly.
   ``They feel an opera house is not their world, but they would
feel more at home in a place like Earl's Court,'' she said.
   Mrs. Hochhauser said the Royal Opera and its rival, the English
National Opera, toyed over the years with the idea of going to
Earl's Court.
   ``But they never came up with a solution to the set problem _
they didn't have one to fit,'' she said.
   American mezzo-soprano Grace Bumbry will portray Aida on opening
night and give one extra performance, while other international
stars will rotate in the leading roles.
   The production is the idea of Italian director and designer
Vittorio Rossi, who has put on similar shows in indoor stadiums in
Paris and Zurich.
   ``Aida,'' the grandest of grand operas, tells of the love of
Radames, captain of the Pharaoh's guard, for Aida, a slave and
daughter of the king of Ethiopia whom Radames has captured.
Radames, tricked into betraying military secrets, is buried alive
and Aida chooses to die with him.
   The tricky task of projecting the singer's voices to all parts
of the hall is being solved by having the singers wear tiny radio
microphones. The producers say the distances are so great that the
mikes are unlikely to be visible.
   The London Symphony Orchestra will perform with 85 musicians
conducted by Nello Santi. The London City Ballet is also taking
part as well as the Ambrosian Opera Chorus of 200.
   The production opens on Sunday June 26 and runs through Saturday
July 2.

   For William Broyles Jr., Vietnam veteran,
author and former magazine editor, the juxtaposition of an
evacuation hospital and an R-and-R center near Da Nang seemed the
perfect TV setting to capture not just the war's horror but also
its black humor.
   ``China Beach,'' the show Broyles co-created with
writer-producer John Sacret Young, premieres tonight as a two-hour
movie on ABC, then will run for six Wednesdays.
   It tells the story of Vietnam from a different perspective, that
of three women in Vietnam in late 1967, a nurse, a Red Cross
volunteer and an entertainer.
   ``China Beach is the name of a real area,'' said Broyles. ``I
was there during the war. It's south of Da Nang on the ocean. It's
like an in-country rest-and-recreation area. Right next to it was
the 95th Evacuation Hospital. Those two worlds are what the show's
all about. It had a strange Club Med atmosphere and the very
intense reality of the hospital.
   ``If there's any word I'd use, it's the contrast between the
R-and-R area and the hospital. This is not a war story, but the war
setting does give us the opportunity for great drama and great
comedy because of the intense activity.''
   ``The deepest humor is when you laugh in the presence of death.
When I was in Vietnam some of my friends were killed, but we still
laughed. That's how you survived. We're going for that kind of
humor.''
   The series stars Dana Delany as nurse Colleen McMurphy, Chloe
Webb as singer Laurette Barber and Nan Woods as Red Cross worker
Cherry White.
   Few series have looked at women at war. ``Broadside'' in 1964-65
was more or less the distaff side of ``McHale's Navy.'' ``Operation
Petticoat'' was a brief show in 1977-78 about Army nurses aboard a
pink submarine in World War II. There was ``M-A-S-H,'' of course,
with famous nurse Margaret Houlihan, but the viewpoint on the
nurses in Korea was strictly male.
   ``You meet these women and you get enthusiastic about them,''
said Broyles. ``They went there to serve, not to kill. They went
there to help their fellow man. I don't want to sound too
pretentious, but that's what these women did. We've got a wealth of
stories about them. One of our writers, Susan Rhinehart, was in the
Army in Vietnam.''
   Broyles and Young worked with women who had served in Vietnam,
who helped not only with the scripts but with the sets. The movie
was filmed in Hawaii and Indian Dunes, an area north of Los
Angeles, where the sets for the R-and-R area and hospital were
built.
   Broyles, 43, was a combat Marine lieutenant in Vietnam in 1969
and returned in 1984 as a writer looking for material for his book
``Brothers in Arms: A Journey from War to Peace.''
   He was one of the first combat veterans to return. ``I wanted to
meet the people I had fought against,'' he said.
   Broyles founded Texas Monthly magazine in 1972 with Michael
Levy. Later, they bought New West magazine and changed the name to
California. From there Broyles went to Newsweek as editor-in-chief
in 1982. He stayed with the magazine for two years.
   Broyles had suggested the concept of the television series to
Scott Kaufer, vice president of development at Warner Bros.
Television. Kaufer had worked with Broyles as an editor on
California magazine.
   ``Then John came in as executive producer,'' said Broyles. ``He
has an extensive knowledge of Vietnam _ and he's never been there.
We worked together on the pilot and he wrote the script.''

   A white elephant in Thailand is not
anything you blithely unload. White elephants here are revered and
pampered as national treasures.
   Thailand today is the home of the white elephant believed to
have given rise years ago to the term ``white elephant'' of the
other kind.
   But Thais don't demean the beasts by calling them white
elephants. They call them ``Auspiciously Significant Elephants.''
   They are modern Thailand's link to the days when kings rode
elephants into battle and fought over the white ones.
   White elephants today reside in finely appointed stables, are
assigned two caretakers each and daily consume up to 660 pounds of
specially purchased greenery, garnished with papayas, bananas and
other elephant delicacies.
   White elephants are by law offered to the king and the current
monarch, Bhumibol Adulyadej, has 11 of them. They make themselves
very much at home around his palace, strolling on manicured lawns,
bathing in a lake and liberally stripping the royal foliage.
   White elephants, which are said to bestow good fortune on their
owners, don't come without expense. The herd doesn't earn its keep,
which includes of food bill equivalent to several thousand dollars
a month.
   Hence the term ``white elephant'' as used elsewhere to mean a
possession maintained at very high expense with very little in
return.
   While the term in that sense isn't used in the Thai language,
the English one may have originated from the practice of old Thai
monarchs giving white elephants to nobles. Such gifts could hardly
be refused and the creatures proceeded to eat their masters out of
house and home.
   In former times _ the earliest records of their capture date to
the 15th century _ white elephants bathed behind a screen to
protect them from commoners' eyes. Kings of Thailand (Siam in those
days) and Burma went to war over them.
   Beliefs, some still extant, grew up around them. Ailing
children, it is said, can be cured by walking or crawling under
their bellies. The hair from the tails of white elephants,
incorporated into rings, can ward off evil.
   The fortunes of all elephants have since declined in Thailand.
Massive deforestation has dramatically depleted the wild population
to probably fewer than 2,000.
   Modern machines and roads have reduced elephants' usefulness in
the logging industry and as beasts of burden. Domesticated
elephants, which numbered nearly 13,500 in 1950, are down to fewer
than 4,000 today.
   Roundups in the jungles, royal processions of caparisoned
animals, the thundering charges of elephants in battle have been
replaced by spectacles that some traditionalists regard as less
than dignified. Today, elephants play soccer, take part in mock
combat and lift their trunks on command in hotel reception areas
for the amusement of tourists.
   Only a few outsiders are allowed into the stables of the white
elephants at Chitralada Villa, where the animals, ranging in age
from 10 to 59 years, are protected from undue stress, disease and
any would-be human predators. Killing a white elephant is
punishable by five years in prison.
   Phiphatanachatr Diskul, a veterinarian assigned to the white
elephants' medical care, said the elephants get a blood test every
six months and are given medicines and vitamins as needed.
Initially, the keepers tried to sneak pills into bananas, sticky
rice and other food but since the animals gingerly discarded them,
a 4{-inch syringe now is used.
   To warrant such attention, an elephant must have 11 special
characteristics including whitish eyes and a pinkish palette. White
elephants, or albinos, are rarely if ever all white but rather
mottled with off-whites and other skin tones other than the
standard elephant gray.
   Once such an elephant is found, the word makes its way up
through official channels to the Royal Household in Bangkok. An
expert is dispatched and looks for the requisite characteristics.
He also assesses the beast's personality, bearing and even whether
it possesses a pleasant-sounding snore. If those tests are met, he
proclaims the animal an ``Auspiciously Significant Elephant.''
   At a later date the king presides over an elaborate induction
ceremony, the roots of which lie deep in Hindu and Buddhist lore.
   Sawej Thanapradit, an 82-year-old expert who has worked with
royal elephants most of his life, said the traditions and rituals
surrounding white elephants once also existed in Laos, Burma,
Cambodia and Sri Lanka, formerly Ceylon. But political and social
changes in those countries have turned royal white elephants into
mere albinos.
   ``In Thailand, they will be with us a very long time,'' Sawej
said, explaining that ``Auspiciously Significant Elephants'' are
closely linked to the monarchy, which remains a vigorous
institution.

<HEAD>Panama Low on Supplies and Prospects for More are Dim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``You can describe what is happening
in the country like this,'' said the head of a major company as he
drew a circle on a piece of paper. ``Have you ever seen a snake
eating its tail?''
   Trapped in the standoff between Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on
one side and the local opposition and Reagan administration on the
other, Panamanians are using up what little Panama has left, with
dim prospects of getting more.
   ``The country is becoming paralyzed and now we are in the phase
of eating up our inventories,'' said the Panamanian, who is the
general manager of a major American company here. Like most
businessmen here, he spoke only condition of anonymity because of
the sensitive situation.
   ``There is going to be a total exhaustion of supplies on hand,''
he added. ``If we can't import raw materials, when the inventories
run out we can't produce.''
   Banks have been closed to the public by government order since
March 4, because of cash shortages following months-long runs on
accounts and a U.S. freeze on Panamanian assets as part of the plan
to force Noriega out as strongman.
   Without banks, the local economy runs on a cash-only basis. Even
the most reliable customers have lost the credit they had with
suppliers.
   Some Panamanian and foreign banks reopened April 18 but only to
accept deposits.
   Except for some foods such as rice, an essential here, and a few
manufactured goods, Panama runs on imports.
   The situation became critical Feb. 26, the day Noriega
engineered the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle for issuing
an order firing the general. Noriega had just been indicted in the
United States on drug trafficking charges.
   Hardly anyone seems to have escaped in the aftermath.
   _Like everyone else, Harinas Panama, one of the country's three
flour mills, can't buy wheat because its supplier wants cash for it.
   General Manager Tirso A. Wolfschoon said the company is
negotiating to get more wheat, but then there might not be any bags
to put the flour in. He said his suppliers are having trouble
getting materials for cloth and plastic bags.
   _An association of insurance companies announced it can't pay
claims and its clients can't pay premiums.
   _Construction is virtually halted. Equipment stands idle at the
concrete skeletons of twin 24-story condominium towers on prime
real estate.
   _Colgate Palmolive, a wholly owned branch of the U.S. company,
is selling from its inventories of toothpaste, detergents and other
personal care and cleaning products. Like many others companies, it
has given its employees vacations, but General Manager Carlos
Rodriguez said that when worker get back from their vacations, the
factory will use up its inventories.
   ``The main problem will be the massive unemployment this can
generate,'' he said.
   _For 10 years Panama has been self-sufficient in rice, but
growers say farmers aren't planting because of the lack of credit
and uncertainty over whether they'll be able to get fertilizers and
other chemicals.
   Rice on hand normally would last through June or July, they say.
But in the crisis, people are buying only essentials _ and rice is
at the top of the list.
   _Supermarkets are still well-stocked. Nicolas Psychoyos of the
Rey chain said sales are running at 40 percent of last year's. Some
imported items, such as breakfast cereals, cooking oils and canned
fruits, are running low, but local brands and all essentials are
available.
   _Activity in the cluster of white towers of the international
banking center that grew up here in the 1970s is near a standstill.
   According to one estimate, 50 to 70 of the 118 foreign banks
have closed or are in the process of closing. Others say none have
closed officially.
   Some Panamanian economists said they hold out hope that the
center can revive, at least on some scale, but others say it is all
but gone and that business is already moving to Britain's Cayman
Islands in the Caribbean south of Cuba.
   To survive, the Panamanian business instinct has come up with
some creative answers.
   Some companies, like Colgate, have been paying employees with as
much cash as they can muster, giving it to the lowest-scale
workers. The rest receive coupons to buy food at supermarkets.
   Supermarkets and some other businesses are accepting the
paychecks of government employees and in turn using them to pay
utility bills.
   Supermarkets also are accepting checks of low denominations from
suppliers' employees, then returning them for supplies.
   Some businesses are resorting to barter.
   Psychoyos of the Rey supermarket chain said he has exchanged
food or cancelled overdue accounts for windows, doors, reinforcing
rods, wood, cinder block, trucks of fruit and ``just about anything
that has value to it.''
   ``We'll find someone who needs them and pay them with that,'' he
said.
   A beer distributor in the provinces accepted food in payment,
then used the food to pay its employees.
   Even if the situation is resolved soon, recovery will take years
and depend on the influx of foreign aid, according to businessmen
and economists.
   Some Panamanians now question the economic pressure the United
States is using to force Noriega out and reduce the role of his
Panama Defense Forces.
   ``Right now, there's no winner in Panama,'' said one. ``We're
all losers.''

   Today is Saturday, May 7, the 128th day of 1988. There are 238
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 7, 1945, Germany signed an unconditional surrender at
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters in Rheims, France, that
was to take effect the following day, ending the European stage of
World War II.
   On this date:
   In 1789, the first inaugural ball was held in New York in honor
of President and Mrs. George Washington.
   In 1812, the poet Robert Browning was born in London.
   In 1825, Italian composer Antonio Salieri died in Vienna,
Austria.
   In 1833, composer Johannes Brahms was born in Hamburg, Germany.
   In 1840, composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky was born in the Ural
region of Russia.
   In 1847, the American Medical Association was founded in
Philadelphia.
   In 1915, nearly 1,200 people died when a German torpedo sank the
British liner Lusitania off the Irish coast.
   In 1939, Germany and Italy announced a military and political
alliance known as the Rome-Berlin Axis.
   In 1954, the 55-day day Battle of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam ended
with Vietnamese insurgents overrunning French forces, spelling the
end of French colonial rule in Indochina.
   In 1960, Leonid Brezhnev replaced Marshal Kliment Voroshilov as
president of the Supreme Soviet.
   In 1963, the United States launched the Telstar II
communications satellite.
   In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford formally declared an end to
the ``Vietnam era.'' In Saigon _ renamed Ho Chi Minh City _ the
Viet Cong staged a rally to celebrate their takeover.
   Ten years ago: Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, closing
out a weeklong visit to the United States, called on his country's
Arab neighbors to ``sit down and negotiate peace'' as he addressed
an enthusiastic crowd in New York's Central Park.
   Five years ago: Sunny's Halo, ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, took
command in the stretch to win the Kentucky Derby on a rainy day at
Churchill Downs.
   One year ago: Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart,
dogged by reports about his relationship with Miami model Donna
Rice, put his campaign on hold and flew home to Denver to be with
his family.
   Today's Birthdays: Actor Darren McGavin is 66. Singer Teresa
Brewer is 57. Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) is 56. Former football
quarterback Johnny Unitas is 55.
   Thought for Today: ``Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.'' _

<HEAD>Argentine Government Runs Pro-Democracy Ads to Thwart Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDALL HACKLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Concerned that some military men
might still be restless in the barracks, Argentina's civilian
government is running television spots to promote democracy.
   ``Democracy comes from a Greek word meaning people's choice,''
the narrator says solemnly in one of them.
   The commercials follow revolts at three army camps last year and
similar uprisings three months ago at six army garrisons by the
cashiered rebel leader Lt. Col. Aldo Rico.
   The military, which has a history of intervention in government,
turned government over to civilians in 1983 after ruling for seven
years.
   President Raul Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union Party and the
opposition Peronist Party have began debate on a law to amend the
Constitution to strengthen civilian rule and reform the military to
keep the armed forces out of politics.
   ``This country is tired of the continous agitations provoked by
a small group that does not represent the general sentiment in the
armed forces,'' said Antonio Cafiero, the governor of Buenos Aires
province, chairman of the Peronist Party, and a leading
presidential candidate.
   No civilian president in Argentina has completed a full term in
60 years. The military has toppled governments here six times since
1930, most recently when Isabel Peron was ousted in 1976 as the
successor to her husband, President Juan D. Peron.
   Alfonsin has 20 months left in his six-year term.
   But recent events indicate domestic instability. Recent
terrorist bombings in this capital and Cordoba wounded four people,
including two federal policemen. One terrorist suspect was killed
by police.
   Pro-Rico graffiti has spread from shantytowns outside Buenos
Aires to downtown, near the seat of government.
   ``Rico is a patriot,'' ``Rico is God'' and ``Rico is freedom,''
the graffiti says.
   Rico is being held pending rebellion charges in the Magdalena
military prison 62 miles south of Buenos Aires. The prison is where
five former military leaders, including two military ex-presidents,
also are held.
   The five leaders of the former military junta were convicted by
the Alfonsin government for their roles in human rights abuses
during Argentina's ``dirty war,'' a campaign waged in the late
1970s by the military against alleged leftist subversion.
   At least 9,000 civilians vanished without a trace, according to
a government panel, but human rights groups say the number of
people abducted, tortured and ultimately ``disappeared'' is closer
to 30,000.
   A year ago flashing TV spots saying ``Democracy or
Dictatorship'' urged civilians to take to the streets to show
support of the government during military uprisings April 15-21 in
Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Tucuman.
   Alfonsin won the surrender of Rico at Campo de Mayo, Argentina's
largest army base in suburban Buenos Aires, and told 400,000 people
assembled in the central Plaza de Mayo, ``The house is in order and
no blood was shed.''
   When new rebel uprisings in January ended after 96 hours with
Rico's surrender again, Alfonsin said, ``We have again put our
house in order.''
   But in the past year, conditions have worsened on the economic
and social fronts.
   Argentina had to renegotiate its $54.3 billion foreign debt,
third-largest in Latin America, and inflation has run at a rate of
206 percent in the 12-month period. Workers are restive because
their wages buy less and less, and Alfonsin's party was routed in
congressional and gubernatorial elections by the resurgent
Peronists.
   Human rights groups such as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,
made up of relatives who lost loved ones in the ``dirty war,''
charged Alfonsin caved in to Rico and that he pushed a law through
Congress that pardoned most officers accused of rights atrocities.
   Rico, meanwhile, has attracted support from rightist groups such
as National Alert, an organization that favors a return to military
rule.
   Three army officers have gone underground since February,
announcing they sided with Rico and planned to fight what they
described as the ``Marxist enemy.''
   Rico maintains the military should not be penalized for tactics
he described as necessary in its 1970s war against subversion or be
blamed for the embarrassing loss to Britain in the 1982 Falklands
War.
   While Rico has found support among younger, mid-level army
officers, he is the butt of many local jokes, particularly about
his surrendering after vowing to ``fight to the finish.''
   Argentines say Rico has broken an unofficial record by
surrendering three times in six years, first during the Falklands
War, where he was a decorated commando, and twice at his own
rebellions.

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The roughly chiseled features and
downcast eyes are all that remain as reminders of the little girl
who lived here more than 2,000 years ago.
   Nearby, looking down at her in the excavation, stood another
little girl, this one from the modern village that had been built
atop the ancient Saar burial mounds where the chiseled stone was
found in February.
   The village girl's hair was cut short, like that of the girl in
stone; they could have been sisters had they not been born 20
centuries apart.
   The ``little girl tombstone'' is one of five identified as
belonging to the Tylos culture that existed on this island in the
Persian Gulf around the time of Christ.
   The thousands of ancient graves on Bahrain, 30 miles long and 10
miles across at its widest point, once gave rise to a theory that
it was used as a regional burying ground.
   However, the Danish archaeologist Bruno Frolich, among others,
says, ``There is no existing evidence that requires us to assume
that the dead were anything other than inhabitants of Bahrain
island.''
   Over the years, many of these burial sites have been obliterated
by population and urban growth, a process that continues. The Saar
mounds are being excavated under pressure from developers who own
the property and are impatient to have it cleared.
   ``Our problem is that the construction of new buildings is
coming very quickly,'' said Abdul Aziz Sowaileh, the superintendent
of archaeology. ``Bahrain would like to build houses, houses. And
everywhere you dig in Bahrain, you will find some evidence of the
prehistoric or ancient past.
   ``So we can't preserve all the mounds, but we try to do our best
to preserve as many as we can.''
   At this site, known as the ``baby grave,'' 85 graves radiate
from the center of a giant burial mound, with the most recent at
the outer edges.
   Thirty-five jars containing skeletal remains of infants were
also found here, giving the site its name.
   Sowaileh said some burial jars, pottery and skeletal remains
probably will be removed and exhibited in Bahrain's new national
museum.
   Ancient writings suggest Bahrain may have been the Garden of
Eden described in the Old Testament. The Sumerians of what is now
southern Iraq knew the island as Dilmun, during the Bronze Age,
some 4,500 years ago.
   Succeeding cultures built atop earlier ones, making this a rich
area for archaeologists. Although most of the Saar mounds, a few
miles west of Manama, Bahrain's main city, are older, this
particular site dates from the Greco-Roman period, 200 B.C.-200
A.D., when the island was called Tylos.
   For centuries, Bahrain, which is near the Persian Gulf's western
shore, has been a stopping-off place for traders, merchants,
pirates and armies on the move.
   Alexander the Great never reached Bahrain during 13 years of
conquering the world as he knew it, but some of his generals did.
   Along with skeletal remains, the contents of other graves
escaped pillage over the years. One family mound has yielded a
trove of about 1,000 items _ necklaces, glazed pottery and
glassware, some in relatively good condition.
   The mounds are rounded cones, enclosing burial chambers or grave
complexes. From afar, they resemble giant anthills. Up close, they
are distinguished from natural formations by their even appearance.
   Some rise to about six feet, others are at ground level. At this
site, the chambers are generally below ground, cut into bedrock.
   Bahrain still has about 100,000 known burial mounds.
   In 1880, a British officer-explorer, E.L. Durand, wrote in his
journal: ``Mighty mounds, bare of vegetation, tower above the palm
groves. Mass upon mass, mound upon mound, they stretch on in
endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to
the sea.''
   The 30 Tylos mounds, of which the family site is one, could
prove important in the study of the Tylos civilization. Sowaileh
said it shows, for example, that people of that time made glazed
pottery.
   ``We also notice a change in burial customs from this period,''
he said. ``People are buried clothed, their positions are changed,
so they are placed on their backs, and put into some kind of
coffin. We didn't see these things before the Greeks came to
Bahrain.''
   He said the discovery of more than 300 silver Greek coins, some
bearing the likeness of Alexander the Great, indicate that ancient
Tylos, like modern Bahrain, was a flourishing trade center.
   Sowaileh, surveying the gravesite as he spoke, said the
craftsmanship of such artifacts as the ``little girl tombstone'' is
local.
   ``There are other tombstones, very similar to this one, that
have inscriptions in Greek, and must have been made for the Greek
people living here at the time. But they don't have the facial
representation like this one,'' he said of the little girl in stone.
   The little girl from the village had wandered off by now to
rejoin her playmates digging in dirt piled near the mound.
   Her past is only now being discovered.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Are minority students, especially blacks,
getting a fair shake at college? While it's not like the old days
of overt discrimination, recent incidents indicating recurring
racism have prompted soul-searching at the University of Wisconsin
and other institutions. One thing is certain: The enrollment of
blacks has been dropping and expressions of discontent have been
rising.

   From random insults on the street to
graffiti in dorms to fistfights on fraternity row, black students
say, part of their education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
is learning how to deal with racism.
   Geneva Brown, 23, co-president of the Black Student Union, has
received hate mail and heard herself called a ``spook'' and
``jungle bunny.''
   ``This environment is hostile to blacks,'' she says. ``There is
no reason for any black person to come here or stay here.''
   Solomon Ashby, 21, who came to Madison on a football scholarship
from Portsmouth, Va., says, ``It was a severe culture shock. I went
from a community where everyone I saw was black to being a total
minority.'' After five years, the senior says, ``I still find it
very stressful. I'm in a zoology class of 500 where I am the only
black student.''
   There are 722 blacks among Madison's 43,368 students, or 1.66
percent. That is down from 906 seven years ago, when blacks
comprised 2.3 percent of the students. It's among the smallest
percentages of any major U.S. university.
   Racial incidents have erupted into protests on other campuses,
from the 1986 World Series dispute that spilled over into a racial
brawl at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst to protests at the
University of Michigan-Ann Arbor over racist jokes on a campus
radio station to a furor over a fraternity sex show at the
University of Pennsylvania.
   At Pennsylvania State University, 89 activists, most of them
black, were arrested in April for occupying a building in a protest
over that institution's failure to achieve a court-ordered goal of
5 percent black enrollment. Some 2,424, or 3.6 percent, of Penn
State's 67,278 students are black. Penn State's president, Bryce
Jordan, later dropped the charges.
   The upsurge in racial incidents and strife, coupled with lagging
black enrollments on many campuses, is prompting many colleges to
mount new drives to achieve minority hiring and enrollment gains
that have eluded them in the past.
   Robert H. Atwell, president of the American Council on
Education, says, ``We have hit the wall on minority participation
and are loath to face the tough road ahead. Our own inner fatigue
has been accentuated by an administration that has not seen equity
issues as important.''
   The council has enlisted former Presidents Carter and Ford as
co-chairman of a blue-ribbon commission that will issue a report
this spring on problems that may lie ahead for the United States if
more minorities don't graduate from college.
   Kenneth Shaw, president of the 26-campus University of Wisconsin
system, which has only 3,190 blacks among its 161,887 students,
says, ``This isn't a Sunday school lesson we're talking about.
We're approaching a situation by the year 2000 where a third of our
young people going into the work force are going to be minorities.
We can't afford for them to undereducated.''
   The extent of educators' concern was evident at a recent
videoconference on racism on campuses. The conference was organized
by the Johnson Foundation and Governors State University and seen
by 11,000 people on 176 campuses.
   In panel discussions at the Wingspread Conference Center in
Racine, Wis., and interviews on the Madison campus and elsewhere,
experts agreed that today's racial problems are different from the
outright legal discrimination that once kept black students from
college campuses.
   Reginald Wilson, who directs the Office of Minority Concerns for
the American Council on Education, says much of the student protest
arises from ``a wellspring of alienation'' fed by ``day-to-day kind
of indignities'' inside and outside the classroom.
   He says that in student surveys 70 percent of minority students
will say, `We've got real problems,' while 70 percent of white
students will say, `This is a wonderful place.'''
   Raymond Mack, a Northwestern University sociologist, said, ``It
is the casualness (of racism), the fact that it is built into
American society, that makes it such a continuing problem and so
hard to deal with. It's the little flick, flick, flicks that hurt,
not the one blow.''
   While Atwell and others view Hispanic enrollment rates as
``abysmally low,'' it is the rate among blacks that has attracted
the most attention. And it has been blacks who have been subjected
to most widely noted incidents of racism on campuses.
   According to the U.S. Department of Education's Center for
Education Statistics, black college enrollments fell almost 3
percent between 1980 and 1984, but increased slightly by 1986, the
latest year for which the figures are available. The department
says its survey indicated there were 1,081,000 blacks enrolled in
fall 1986, down from the peak of 1,107,000 in 1980.
   But over the past decade the black share of enrollment has
sagged from 9.4 percent to 8.6 percent. At the same time, Census
Bureau figures show, the percentage of black high school graduates
ages 18 to 24 enrolled in college dropped from 33.5 percent in 1976
to 26.1 percent in 1985.
   Only 26.1 percent of the black high school graduates attended
college, down from a peak of 33.5 percent in 1976, according to the
Census Bureau.
   ``The main problem of access is the kid who doesn't have the
stuff to go,'' says Education Secretary William Bennett. Among
students with similar academic achievements, ``black students are
just as likely or more likely than white students to go to
college.''
   ``Most higher education institutions have been diligent about
recruiting black students...'' Bennett says. ``The most serious
underlying barrier to greater black college enrollment is the need
to enlarge the pool of black students who have had the right
preparation.''
   Black men, in particular, are passing up college. They were
outnumbered by black female college students, 645,000 to 436,000,
in 1986, the Department of Education says.
   In 1985, 34,455 black women received bachelor's degrees, 3
percent more than in 1976. But the number of black male graduates,
23,018, was down 10 percent for that same period.

   Overall black enrollment in the University of Wisconsin system
has slid 15 percent since 1980. Other states are wrestling with
similar figures. In New Jersey's nine state colleges and
universities, black undergraduate enrollment dropped from 18,366 in
1980 to 14,237 in 1985. In Rhode Island, 1,975 blacks were enrolled
in colleges and universities in 1986, down from 2,213 in 1980.
   Shaw, the president of the Wisconsin system, kicked up a storm
last November by proposing free tuition for all minorities who
maintained a C-plus average in core academic subjects in high
school.
   The idea drew fire from many sides, including minority leaders
at the Madison campus who feared it would arouse new enmity against
blacks and other minority students. Some said C-plus students
didn't deserve scholarships.
   In a revised ``Design for Diversity,'' Shaw has proposed
doubling minority enrollments by 1993 in part with $1,700-a-year
grants available to 500 disadvantaged Wisconsin residents _ not
just minorities.
   Shaw also wants to raise minority faculty and staff hiring by 75
percent, and to groom 15 new minority Ph.D.s each year for teaching
jobs in the system. The total price tag over four years is nearly
$17 million.
   Shaw builds on the so-called Madison Plan that new University of
Wisconsin Chancellor Donna E. Shalala unveiled in February, six
weeks after arriving in Madison and finding on her desk a thick
pile of recommendations from a student-faculty Steering Committee
on Minority Affairs.
   Shalala, a one-time Carter administration housing official, came
to Wisconsin by way of the presidency of New York City's Hunter
College, where 60 percent of the 19,000 students are minorities.
   Her blueprint, fashioned after a frenetic round of meetings with
faculty, student, staff and community leaders, calls for doubling
freshman minority enrollment by 1993, hiring 70 new minority
faculty over the next three years and 125 minority staff members.
   At Duke University in Durham, N.C., the Faculty Advisory Council
reversed itself last month following faculty and student protests
and required each of the institution's more than 50 departments to
hire one more black faculty member by 1993.
   The University of Wisconsin faculty senate is being asked to
approve an ethnic studies course requirement, and Shalala's
administration endorsed construction of a multicultural center for
students _ although not one left solely in the hands of minority
students, as activists had called for.
   Shalala found $1.6 million in existing funds to launch the plan,
and is asking the state legislature for $4.7 million more for its
first three years. Some of the money will go into financial aid for
the disadvantaged.
   Big debts have become a routine part of college life for many
students in the past decade with the federal government shifting
its emphasis from grants to loans. Many educators suspect that is a
prime reason why the black share of college enrollment has dropped.
They say the military is also recruiting a growing share of black
high school graduates with its promise of both training and a
paycheck.
   David Wright, 23, minority affairs director for the Wisconsin
Student Association, says, ``A lot of people just don't feel like
going out and taking out $20,000 in loans. That's what I've had to
do.''
   ``Then there's the Army: `Be all you can be.' It's tempting,''
says Wright, a senior from Milwaukee who is one of 11 children. ``I
know people who have college degrees who can't buy a job, and I
know people who got jobs out of high school and are making money I
dream of.''
   Fellow senior Solomon Ashby says, ``A lot of people see this
high level of education as superfluous. They'd much rather get into
the job force right after high school. A lot of the trade skills
are making much more money than people with a bachelor of arts
degree.''
   Ashby has worked summers in the shipyards back in Portsmouth as
an $8-an-hour painter, and has seen buddies who chose not to return
to college. ``The future may be somewhat limited,'' he says, but
the jobs pay more than beginning teachers make.
   Charles Holley, 23, from Chicago, also a senior political
science major and co-president of the Black Student Union, says,
``I don't think Madison has a good image in terms of black
students. Everybody who has friends who go to Madison knows there
is nothing for you to do if you're black up here. There's no black
music...The social life is essentially null and void.''
   Shalala says, ``What I want to do is make this place more like
the real world, more multi-ethnic, more multicultural. There is a
new generation of leaders, not only in higher education, but in
this society. We have come up through the civil rights movement,
through the peace movement and through the women's
movement...Twenty years ago, I was one of those demonstraters and I
promised myself if I ever got into a position of power, I would be
different in the way in which I led an institution.''
   The 47-year-old Shalala says Madison will build its minority
enrollment numbers ``the hard way,'' including finding transfer
students and older students, and recruiting heavily in Milwaukee _
something it has not been doing.
   Wisconsin's population is 3.8 percent black.
   ``I have to be real careful,'' Shalala says. ``I can't be so
hungry for minorities that we bring in kids that really can't make
it here...We're not in the remedial business.''
   She notes that on the same day the conference on campus racism
was held at Wingspread, Congress was overriding President Reagan's
veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act, which bars discrimination
in federally subsidized institutitons.
   ``That is very important for universities,'' she says. ``It
holds us accountable for every department and every program.''
   The success or failure of higher education's current drive to
improve the racial climate and minority participation on campuses
will also be affected by ``who's elected president (and) what tone
is set,'' Shalala says.
   ``We're not going to make deep inroads until we change the way
in which we run urban schools in this country.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In Pennsylvania, birthplace of the oil industry,
pumping crude and gas is a way of life for many small operators.
They're not about to yield to regulators whose environmental rules,
they say, are ruinously adding to their costs, even if it makes
them look like moonshiners.

   Falling oil prices and tough new
environmental regulations have Don Taylor producing oil like a
bootlegger working a still.
   ``We're running illegal,'' says Taylor, a short, stocky man who
fiercely protects his 150 oil wells from inquisitive state
officials.
   ``Every time my black lab barks, I look to see whether it's the
law. It's just like moonshining. But what choice do we have?''
   Taylor refuses to register his wells with state authorities.
``If they have a problem,'' he says, ``they should know where the
problem is.'' So far he's managed to avoid investigators because of
spotty enforcement and legal challenges to the new regulations.
   ``It's not a matter of being a hero or a smart aleck,'' he says,
referring to his candor. ``It's just a matter of trying to
survive.''
   Defiance is not uncommon among small producers in this, the
oldest oil and gas field in the world. Here the first oil well was
drilled in 1859 and the first gas well in 1868.
   Operating on the shady side of the law may mean the difference
between making a living and going bankrupt, says Taylor. He
estimates it would cost him about $100,000 to be ``legal.''
   Complying with state regulations, which include a $25,000 bond
and expensive rules for discharging brine and plugging unused
wells, may cost more than the $5-a-day revenues realized from the
average oil well and $8 a day from the average gas well in
Pennsylvania.
   The regulations probably would have gone down easier had they
not accompanied the worst price collapse in the history of the
energy industry _ a collapse that has hurt the nation's other 32
oil and gas producing states as well.
   ``This has been the worst depression in the oil industry since
the 1930s,'' says Ron Harris, spokesman for the Independent
Petroleum Association of America, which represents 7,000
independent oil and gas producers.
   ``A lot of independents are struggling.''
   About 20 miles away, near the village of Knox, Dwight Stover
maneuvers his four-wheel-drive pickup up a steep, rutted trail to
check for the last time on wells that have been oozing fuel as
predictably as Old Faithful for almost 100 years.
   In this pristine setting, populated by wild turkeys, deer, black
bear and grouse, forests of hemlocks and mountain laurel camouflage
one of the most densely developed natural gas areas in the state.
   Many of the wells are still flowing, although at low volumes,
kept alive by thousands of small operators like Taylor and Stover.
   Small producers started the oil and gas industry more than 120
years ago. They're the wildcatters who explored new oil fields,
drilled new gas wells and resurrected abandoned sites. And even in
these times of multinational conglomerates, their low-volume wells,
called stripper wells, still make up three-quarters of the nation's
total.
   ``You can't afford to drill a new well to get 10 gallons of oil
a day. But if you can sell 10 gallons of oil at a decent price, you
can pump that well indefinitely,'' says Stover, a trim man of 54
who's been producing gas for 20 years.
   But while the world's appetite for gas and oil continues to
grow, a host of problems, including rock-bottom prices, stringent
environmental regulations, Arab oil and restricted pipelines, have
forced the grandchildren of the energy pioneers out of business.
   ``You know, everybody would like to own an oil well. Everybody
thinks that all you need is an oil well to be rich. But that's the
farthest thing from the truth,'' said Stover. He recently turned
off his 97 gas wells after his main customer, a glass plant, went
out of business.
   ``Three years ago I had an offer of $750,000 for my wells.
Today, I don't think I could give them away.''
   In 1986, U.S. crude oil dropped to $10 a barrel from a March
1981 high of $34.70, according to the Independent Petroleum
Association of America.
   Currently prices hover around $14.25 a barrel for U.S. crude and
$16 for Pennsylvania Grade crude, a paraffin-based oil prized for
its lubricating qualities.
   For the state's stripper wells, which average one-third a barrel
per day, or 14 gallons, the yield is about $5 a day, a mere drop in
the bucket compared to the 200 barrels daily produced by a typical
medium-sized oil well in Texas or Oklahoma.
   ``Legislators think in barrels, and we talk gallons. That's why
it takes so many wells to survive,'' says Taylor, 45, who owns
several 100-year-old wells.

<HEAD>OIL CITY, Pa.: 100-year-old wells.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Natural gas rates vary widely, depending on the contracts
producers have with their customers, but generally they average
about $2.30 per thousand cubic feet in Pennsylvania. Stripper gas
wells yield about 3,500 cubic feet a day, about $8, according to
Steve Rhoads of the Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Association.
   ``This is a technical business,'' Stover says. ``I don't mean to
overplay it, but if someone gave the average guy 10 oil wells and
he attempted to produce them, he'd be a lot poorer at the end of
two years than if he didn't do anything. It takes a lot of
innovation and technical savvy to make money with all the equipment
in an oil well when you get only $4 a day.''
   Compounding the economic troubles for Pennsylvania's oil and gas
operators is a new package of stringent environmental regulations
passed in 1984. Rhoads calls them ``vindictive overkill.''
   ``There's no way any individual operator can afford to comply
with the current structure of the regulations,'' he says. ``It's
not a problem of law. It's a problem of the way the laws are
administered, problems the bureaucrats have discretion over.''
   ``We always survived the low price before. You just learn to run
your operation to what your oil or gas check is,'' Taylor says.
``But we didn't have all this environmental threat. They've got the
penalties so far out of range and there's no way in God's world we
could comply.''
   Rhoads acknowledges that before the law was passed, the industry
was mostly self-policing. Drilling permits were free and operators
``could do what they wanted.'' In fact, he says, Pennsylvania was
one of the last states to adopt environmental regulations for the
energy industry.
   But the new law, he says, dealt with worst-case scenarios rather
than everyday problems, to which were added excessive fees and
burdensome paperwork. In one permit process, for instance, Stover
spent more than $373 in postage to send 97 applications to the
state because each had to be mailed individually.
   The new law includes a $2,500-per-well bond for fewer than 10
wells or $25,000 bond for 10 or more wells and a
presumption-of-guilt clause that makes operators liable for
drinking water contamination if the pollution occurs within 1,000
feet of their well. Abandoned wells must be plugged within a year,
which Rhoads says can easily cost more than $5,000 per well.
   Rather than allowing operators to standardize the method of
discharging brine, a common byproduct of oil drilling, the act
requires separate plans for each discharge point, which can cost
$6,000 to $50,000 per permit, Rhoads says.
   Many small independents say they would rather sell than deal
with such regulations. Even that may not be feasible under current
prices.
   It's ``impossible to sell or even give away property with
inactive wells. I know because I tried,'' says Willard Cline, 63,
from Bradford, who owns several hundred wells near the New York
border. ``Any buyer would have to bond the wells ... and be
approved by the state. He would have to put aside money for
plugging.''
   ``We can't hang it up,'' says Taylor, whose father carried him
into the oil fields when he was a boy. ``We've either got to plug
these wells or bond them and get legal. If I can't afford to
produce, how am I going to afford to plug?''
   John Ifft, oil and gas program manager for the Department of
Environmental Resources, says producers' woes are more related to
price than regulations. Pennsylvania's laws, he says, are no more
stringent than those of other states.
   ``All you have to do is read the newspapers and find out the
same problems exist in the western states,'' says Ifft, who used to
be an independent producer.
   Not surprisingly, environmentalists don't see eye to eye with
the producers.
   Oil and gas people ``create this false issue of environmental
regulations,'' says Mark Peterson of the Pennsylvania Public
Interest Coalition, a statewide consumer group with 100,000 members.
   ``To look at them in one period of time is to really misconstrue
the business. They're in a boom and bust business, and they know it
full well...These are big operators. They may look small, but they
can still make fantastic sums.''
   ``He's watched too much TV,'' counters Rhoads. The typical small
operator is ``a working man who has a family to support and is
living in the woods and enjoys it. He's a mom-and-pop business.''
   Despite their complaints, most small operators will stick it
out, Rhoads says.
   ``Out here in this country, you're talking a marginal lifestyle
for many people. There aren't a whole lot of employment
opportunities, so you deal in what you know...What these people
know is oil and gas because they were born with it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Irving Berlin, America's best-known but most
private songwriter, turns 100 this week. A diverse group of
entertainers will take part in a tribute to Berlin at Carnegie
Hall, but don't expect him to attend. Except for occasional
strolls, Berlin stays home, talking infrequently with his friends
by telephone.

<TEXT>
   Shortly before midnight on May 10, a small group
of carolers will gather in front of a five-story brick mansion
facing the East River on New York's posh Beekman Place.
   When the clock strikes 12, this impromptu glee club, led by
composer and cabaret performer John Wallowitch, will break into
``Happy Birthday,'' followed by a chorus of ``Always.''
   They will be celebrating at the doorstep of the man who wrote
that haunting love song. Irving Berlin, America's best-known _ yet
most private _ songwriter turns 100 on May 11, 1988.
   Just mention the melodies Berlin wrote, and you'll start to
sing: ``White Christmas,'' ``Easter Parade,'' ``God Bless
America,'' ``There's No Business Like Show Business,''
``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' ``A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody,''
``Puttin' on the Ritz,'' ``Blue Skies,'' ``How Deep is the
Ocean?,'' ``Cheek to Cheek,'' to name a few.
   Wallowitch's Berlin salute, an annual celebration he began more
than 20 years ago and which he usually holds at 6 p.m. on Christmas
Eve, may be the most personal tribute to Berlin this year.
   ``They have been devastatingly emotional experiences,'' says
Wallowitch, an unabashed Berlin fan who lives down the street and
around the corner from the composer.
   But the only festivity officially recognized by the songwriter
will be a Carnegie Hall salute on May 11 held in connection with
ASCAP, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
Berlin is a charter member of the organization _ founded in 1914 _
that licenses music for public performance.
   The collection of diverse performers expected to appear at the
gala includes Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, Jerome Robbins, Walter
Cronkite, Isaac Stern, Ray Charles and Garrison Keillor. It will be
taped by CBS for a television special later in the month.
   Don't expect an appearance by the master. Berlin is passionate
about his privacy. Except for short walks around Beekman Place when
the weather is warm, Berlin never is seen in public. On his
infrequent strolls through the tranquil, tree-lined neighborhood,
he usually is accompanied by a young woman or a doorman from a
nearby building.
   Call the Irving Berlin Music Corp. and ask for an interview with
the boss. You'll get Hilda Schneider, Berlin's longtime secretary.
She is polite and friendly but adamant in declining interviews for
her employer.
   ``I'm sorry I can't be more encouraging,'' the woman says. ``If
we do one, we'd have to do them all. It's all in the record. You
can look it up.''
   And the record is pretty impressive: Some 1,500 songs that span
the worlds of theater, movies and popular music. No other composer
can match that record.
   For the stage, Berlin wrote ``Annie Get Your Gun'' and more than
a dozen other Broadway shows. His movies include several Fred
Astaire-Ginger Rogers classics such as ``Top Hat'' and ``Follow the
Fleet.'' His pop hits, those songs not written for any particular
stage show or film, include such standards as ``Remember'' and
``All Alone.''
   What makes his music so great?
   ``His songs have the sophistication of simplicity,'' says Morton
Gould, president of ASCAP. ``You know precisely what he's saying
and singing. He's been able to distill everything down to its
essence.
   ``He also expresses universal truths,'' Gould adds. ``If you
look at his song titles and listen to his music, he expresses
emotions that human beings would like to experience. Most people
want blue skies. They want the equivalent of white Christmases or
the whole idea of what `Easter Parade' evokes. And most of us don't
want to be all alone by the telephone. He says it directly and you
feel it.''
   Ironically, the telephone is how Berlin communicates with the
outside world today. When he wants to talk, he calls. The
songwriter has a small circle of telephone friends, people he dials
when he has something on his mind. Gould is one such listener.
   ``He will just call,'' Gould says. ``His liaison will say `Mr.
Berlin would like to talk to you.' When that happens, you drop
everything and pick up the phone. It's a wonderful thing. He has a
keen mind, and he's right on top of everything.''

   Another member of this select telephone circle is Stanley Green,
a musical comedy historian and author of several books about the
Broadway musical. Green last spoke to Berlin when Fred Astaire died
last year. Berlin called Green to express his regret about the
passing of a man he admired very much.
   Most of Berlin's contemporaries are dead. He's the last of the
great musical comedy composers, a pantheon that once included
George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers. Of
his theater contemporaries, only director George Abbott, who turns
101 in June, survives.
   Berlin, born Israel Baline in Russia, came to the United States
at the age of 2. His family settled on New York's Lower East Side
where, as a young boy, Berlin got jobs singing on the Bowery. He
worked as song plugger and a singing waiter at a Chinatown cafe. It
was there that he learned to play the piano, laboriously picking
out tunes with one finger. This self-taught musician writes the
same way.
   `It's an incredible catalog this man has achieved with no formal
education as well as no musical education,'' Green says. ``And to
be able to write music AND lyrics.''
   For all his success, Berlin is a loner, a man very much aware of
his humble origins. His first wife, Dorothy, died from typhoid
fever less than a year after they were married.
   In 1926, Berlin married his second wife, Ellin Mackay, the
daughter of a wealthy and socially prominent businessman, Clarence
Mackay, the president of a commercial telegraph company. She eloped
with Berlin over her Catholic father's objections and the marriage
was front-page news all over the country.
   In the more than 60 years they have been married, Berlin has
kept his wife and his three daughters out of the public eye.
   ``I think a reason he is so very private is that he is wildly in
love with his wife,'' Wallowitch says. ``I think it is one of the
greatest romantic love affairs in history.''
   Berlin is the only major songwriter who never had a film
biography like Cole Porter's ``Night and Day,'' George Gershwin's
``Rhapsody in Blue,'' Sigmund Romberg's ``Deep in My Heart'' or
Rodgers and Hart's ``Words and Music.''
   Coupled with his desire for privacy was Berlin's shrewd business
instincts. In the early 1920s, he and two partners built the Music
Box Theater to showcase his musical revues. He and the Shubert
Organization still own it.
   His music publishing company tightly controls his songs. ASCAP
won't reveal the amount of money these melodies have generated, but
the man is believed to be a millionaire many times over. Berlin
gave the royalties from ``God Bless America'' to the Boy Scouts and
Girl Scouts of America. So far, they have earned some $700,000 from
that one song.
   Berlin withdrew even more from the public eye in 1962 after his
last Broadway musical, ``Mr. President,'' flopped. The show,
starring Robert Ryan and Nanette Fabray, was a wildly anticipated
musical, generating a record box-office advance but tepid reviews.
It had a six-month run.
   Still he came back. Four years later, he wrote a new song, ``An
Old- Fashioned Wedding'' for the Lincoln Center revival of ``Annie
Get Your Gun'' which starred Ethel Merman. Twenty years after the
original production, she stopped the show again with Berlin's new
song.
   In all his years of serenading Berlin, Wallowitch finally was
invited into the Berlin home nearly five Christmas Eves ago after a
chorus of ``White Christmas.'' On an impulse, he rang the doorbell.
A maid answered the door and he and his fellow singers were taken
into the kitchen.
   There they were greeted by Berlin himself, wearing a bathrobe
and slippers. The composer hugged the men, kissed the women and
told them, ``That's the nicest Christmas present I've ever had.''
   Every day, Wallowitch walks his dog Winnie around Beekman Place
and often wonders what is going on inside the big house now.
   ``I keep holding on to the idea that the man is not allowing
himself to be bored and is still writing,'' Wallowitch says. ``God,
I hope it's true.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ To hear some of them tell it, there are more
witches in North America than you can shake a broom at. One of them
is an American who emigrated to Canada, a high priest of Wicca who
is campaigning for witches' rights. Among other things, he wants a
license to perform weddings.
</TEXT>

   He's a Vietnam veteran who spends quiet evenings
watching Cary Grant movies and would like to be reincarnated as
Fred Astaire.
   But Charles Arnold is also Canada's most visible witch, a
second-degree high priest of Wicca, the religion of witchcraft.
   ``I don't melt if water is poured over me,'' says the
40-year-old clerical worker who is campaigning for legal acceptance
of his beliefs in both a male and female divinity, the potency of
magic and absence of original sin.
   Arnold began the quest last year when he asked his boss for paid
religious leave on the Wiccan holidays of ``Samhain,'' Nov. 1, when
witches celebrate the mortality of the body and immortality of the
soul, and ``Belthane,'' May 1, welcoming summer, life and fertility.
   Humber College of Applied Arts and Technology, which employs
Arnold in its hospitality office, denied his request because Wicca
is not recognized by the Canadian Council of Churches and lacks
tax-free charitable status.
   Arnold protested to a labor arbitration board which upheld his
grievance and said: ``Wicca is obviously a religion...the modern
survival of the ancient pagan religions of Western Europe.''
   But Arnold's victory was short-lived.
   The native of Washington, D.C., who served a year in Vietnam,
became an anti-war activist and emigrated to Canada 15 years ago,
had also applied for a license to become the first Canadian witch
authorized to perform weddings.
   In a March ruling, the Ontario registrar-general's office turned
him down. It questioned the legitimacy of his ordination and the
nature of the Wiccan marriage ritual, known as a ``handfasting.''
   Arnold blamed Ontario's Protestant establishment, although
Council of Churches official Edith Shore showed some sympathy for
the Wiccans. ``Christianity was a fringe group when it started,
too,'' she said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Arnold complained that the Marriage Act discriminates against
Canada's 5,000 witches by making it a crime, punishable by up to
six months in jail, to perform an unauthorized wedding.
   ``They should either license me or do away with the law
altogether,'' he said, noting that Wiccan weddings are permitted in
38 U.S. states. He had to travel to Montpelier, Vt., for his own
Wiccan wedding three years ago.
   The practice of witchcraft is fairly widespread in the United
States, but precise numbers are hard to come by.
   ``It's everywhere, every big city probably has a group,'' says
the Rev. W. M. Kent Burtner, a Dominican priest based in Portland,
Ore., who studies cults. ``I see it basically as a nature religion
not associated with Satanism, but that may be skewed because of
whom I get to meet as a Catholic priest. It's a write-your-own
theology sort of a approach and it runs a real broad spectrum.''
   Lady Sabrina, a high priestess in Nashua, N.H., estimates there
are ``a couple of hundred thousand'' members scattered across the
United States, including ``a couple of thousand'' high priests and
priestesses.
   Starhawk, a San Francisco high priestess and author of ``The
Spiral Dance,'' a book about Wicca, largely agrees.
   ``I just had a conversation with someone and we decided that
there were between 250,000 and 4 million of us,'' she says. The 4
million, she explains, would include all pagans.
   ``In any case,'' she says, ``there are more of us than there are
Unitarians.''
   Starhawk says many members are underground.
   ``There is a long tradition where it is not safe to be a
witch,'' she says. ``We don't necessarily announce it. Many
people's jobs would be in jeopardy.''
   Starhawk, an author and lecturer, teaches at a Catholic college
in Oakland, Calif. Her most recent book is ``Truth or Dare
Encounters with Power, Authority and Mystery.''
   Lady Sabrina runs Our Lady of Enchantment, a Wicca mail order
school with 6,000 members representing 25 countries.

   ``I have performed marriages and have tax-exempt status, but I
only know 12 or 15 others who have tax exempt-status,'' she says.
``You really have to fight to get it.''
   ``Many of us in California perform marriages, but here if you go
through the trouble to sign the papers and take a blood test, you
can get licensed to perform marriages,'' Starhawk says. ``A dog
could get the license here.''
   Lady Sabrina, whose church is open to the public on Friday
nights, says she never heard of Charles Arnold, but that does not
surprise her.
   ``For a while a woman in Salem, Mass., who was picketing the
movie `Witches of Eastwick' became very well known. Since there is
no central organization, whoever makes the most noise becomes the
most prominent witch.''
   Arnold, a soft-spokeman man with a beard, says he was initiated
as a priest in witchcraft traditions dating back thousands of years.
   Each coven, grove or temple chooses its own rituals and vows.
Some covens meet in the nude, but Arnold's group prefers robes.
   He offered this description of a Wiccan wedding:
   Inside a magical circle, the male and female divinities are
summoned along with the guardians of the four elements _ air,
water, fire and earth.
   The groom's left hand is bound to the bride's right hand and
some choose to draw blood from their skin and touch like blood
brothers.
   Couples exchange rings, bracelets or floral crowns; step over
flames for purification and fertility, and jump over a broom to
symbolize household unity.
   Traditional gifts include bread (for plenty), silver
(prosperity), salt (health) and wood or coal (physical and
emotional warmth).
   Before the priest pronounces them husband and wife, he invokes
the couple ``to pleasure one another,'' Arnold says. ``We don't cut
sex off from the rest of life. We don't make a big thing out of it
either.''
   At the heart of the primitive religion lies the power of the
male and female in nature, symbolized by the god usually referred
to by the Celtic name Herne, and the goddess known as Cerridwen or
Athena or Isis, Arnold said.
   Wiccans also believe in the mysteries of magic, reincarnation
and in celebrating the rites of passage, such as first menstruation
and menopause.
   ``We go through life after life to learn and evolve and progress
to the point where we rejoin the god and goddess,'' Arnold says.
``Behind them, there is something we can't even identify, the unity
they come from.''
   Witches don't go around laying curses on people, and they don't
conduct human or animal sacrifices, eat babies or worship the devil
as depicted in folklore and comics, he said.
   But the craft does have a practical side.
   ``I mix up potions and my wife makes some of the finest liqueurs
you've ever tasted,'' Arnold says. ``I use wormwood and calendula
(a rare herb) in vinegar to take bruises away and lavender vinegar
for sunburn.''
   Arnold says he discovered his religion 10 years ago after
intuitively constructing a Wiccan altar in his home. A woman he was
dating happened to be a witch and was startled to see the altar.
   Leader of the 50-member Temple of the Elder Faiths in Toronto,
Arnold was raised in New Jersey by a grandmother who read tea
leaves.
   ``We believe that if you are meant to find the craft, you
will,'' he says. ``Many traditional Wiccans think we're growing too
fast and this will water down the religion and may actually destroy
it.''
   He said covens usually meet on eight sabbaths coinciding with
the year's solar and lunar cycles. The average age in his group is
27 and members include a real estate agent, a schoolteacher and a
naturopath.
   ``Covens are closer than most families. Members tend to be more
imaginative than most people and a little bit eccentric,'' said
Arnold, a published poet and expert on ritual body decoration.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A group of Columbus, Ohio, police patrolmen
formed a rock 'n' roll band about a year ago as ``a fun way to get
away from the stress of street duty.'' When the police chief heard
them play, he got the idea of using the band to help combat drug
abuse. Since then, ``Hot Pursuit'' has been spending a lot of time
on the road across the Northeast.

   They're just four street cops and a real
estate agent until they take their guitars, keyboard and drums
before a high school audience. Then they become ``Hot Pursuit,'' a
rock 'n' roll band with a message:
   Stay away from drugs.
   In just over a year they've taken that message to high school
auditoriums and gymnasiums from here to New Jersey. They've cut a
record album, appeared on national television, performed at a White
House anti-drug conference, and have been invited to China.
   The band leans heavily on music from the early days of rock 'n'
roll. The 1955 hit ``Jail House Rock'' is their theme song and they
quickly follow with such numbers as ``Mony Mony'' from 1968,
``Twist and Shout,'' and ``Wipe Out.''
   The five musicians get their kicks watching their young
audiences.
   ``They dance in the aisles and they come on stage to sing with
us,'' says Columbus patrolman Keith Ankrom, the drummer.
   Lt. Karl Tresselt, who doubles as promoter and manager of the
band, says, ``When you hear the enthusiasm of the kids and how they
get into the music, it's all worthwhile.''
   Patrolman Richard Gillilan, bass guitarist and vocalist, says,
``One thing we want to do is show them that cops are people who
have a job to do and then they go home to their families and
bowling leagues like other people.''
   At first it was just a pickup band organized by Columbus
patrolmen. Then about a year ago one dropped out and they brought
in Michael Finks, a real estate agent with a radio-TV background
who works the keyboard and is a backup vocalist.
   Other members of the band are vocalist Randy Moon and lead
guitarist Michael Wilson. Pat Barr is the sound engineer.
   ``We started as a weekend fun way to get away from the stress of
street duty,'' Tresselt says. ``We just played private parties at
first.''
   Then Police Chief Dwight Joseph happened to hear the band play
one night.
   ``He said he wanted to see all of us in his office the first
thing Monday and we thought we were in trouble,'' Tresselt says.
``Then he told us the department could use us to go into schools
with the anti-drug message.''
   From that, the band's reputation has grown. It played at a
regional drug conference in Cincinnati last fall and then got an
invitation to perform at the White House Conference for a Drug-Free
America in February. En route home they played at three schools in
Scotch Plaines, N.J., a suburb of Newark. They plan a four-county
swing to schools in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in May and have been
invited back to New Jersey.
   They also have invitations to play at a July 4 party for the U.
S. Embassy in Beijing and at a national Boy Scout conference in
Boston on July 16.
   ``We've got the hotel reservations and are trying to get someone
to underwrite the plane tickets,'' Tresselt says.
   The band has played a regular schedule of area schools twice a
week since last Nov. 1. This year, they began making one-day swings
to other parts of Ohio.
   Gillilan says a Hollywood entertainment group has approached
them about making a two-hour pilot movie for television.
   ``Just on the sale of the album alone we've raised $12,000 for
the Children's Hospital Guidance Center Drug and Alcohol Program,''
Gillilan says.
   Stacks of mail on Tresselt's desk testify to the reaction from
students across the state.
   ``After one performance a kid wrote us that he had never thought
about policemen having families,'' says Ankrom, percussionist for
the band. ``He thought we just stayed in uniform and rode in patrol
cars 24 hours a day.''
   The band has no budget to speak of, and money is a major
problem. They still play for private parties on weekends but most
of the money earned goes to pay for equipment that Tresselt says is
mostly owned by a bank.
   A department store underwrote the trips to Cincinnati and
Washington. A local automobile dealer has leased the city a band
equipment truck for $1 a year, and the city rented some equipment,
such as strobe lights and smoke machines that allow them to play in
larger auditoriums.
   ``We've got all kinds of ideas for the band and no money,''
Gillilan says.
   ``But we've found that the kids are remembering us,'' he added.
``Two of our guys caught a kid stealing cars on the south end of
town and all the way to the central station all he talked about was
`Hot Pursuit,' and the fact he wasn't on drugs.''
   And, says Tresselt, ``The band keeps us off the street.''

   EDITOR's NOTE _ There are many residential child-care facilities
across the country, but only a few like Colorado's Excelsior Youth
Centers, a haven for troubled young girls. For many of them, the
school represents one last chance before they are locked up or
placed in a hospital.

   Liz, a 17-year-old with a string of drug
arrests, lit a cigarette and summed up her 10 months in Colorado
with the bored look of a graduating senior.
   ``I grew up,'' she said.
   She had not wanted to come to Excelsior Youth Centers, and was
more than ready to go home. But she said the school finally helped
her escape the revolving door of juvenile courts and group homes
she had been stuck in for years in Indiana.
   Excelsior, a place for troubled girls perched on the high plains
southeast of Denver, consists of a junior and senior high school
and Residential Child Care Facility.
   Excelsior is one of a few such schools for girls in the country
and draws students from 17 states.
   For many girls, the school represents one last chance before
they are locked up or placed in a hospital.
   ``You have to put up with the girls, with their smart mouths and
their attitudes and their moods,'' says Liz (not her real name).
``But you get the support of the girls too, and of the staff and
the therapist.''
   She came to Excelsior on the recommendation of a caseworker in
Gary, Ind., after five previous placements had failed to improve
her behavior.
   ``At first I was just really upset because I was getting sent
away from my family,'' she says. Then she started working at a
nearby clothing store, saving money, making friends and continuing
to work with a therapist. Things got better.
   ``They make you deal with your issues _ you just have to be
willing to deal with your issues,'' she says.
   The ``issues'' for Excelsior's 130 girls, ages 12 to 18, range
from incest and abuse to murder, prostitution and, often,
depression.
   There's 13-year-old Jackie, found by social service workers in a
run-down shack in rural Wyoming, unable to speak after years of
sexual and emotional abuse. When she arrived at Excelsior, she
would hoard pieces of metal in her clothes and try to kill herself
with them, school officials said.
   There's Laura, who will stay at Excelsior until she recovers
from the shock of losing two family members to violent deaths, and
Tracy, who arrived after frequent encounters with the juvenile
system in Los Angeles for prostitution and drug abuse.
   One of the school's better-known graduates is Deborah Jahnke,
the Wyoming teen-ager who was convicted with her younger brother,
Richard, in the November 1982 shooting death of their abusive
father. Deborah Jahnke's prison sentence was commuted and she spent
1{ years at Excelsior undergoing psychiatric evaluation and
awaiting court rulings.
   ``These are students they can't educate in the public school
system ... kids with severe emotional and behavioral problems who
would otherwise probably be in a psychiatric hospital,'' says
Excelsior Director William C. Gregory, known to the girls as ``Mr.
Bill.''
   When Gregory walks through the halls during a typical school
day, he is greeted with hellos and hugs.
   In one room a class is making sushi and Mr. Bill is invited to
test it. In another room, a chorus of girls is preparing for a
concert. They ask him if he'll come to see it.
   The cottages where the girls live look out on the Rockies. They
resemble college dormitories more than a reform school. The girls'
rooms are plastered with posters of animals, rock stars, the Denver
Broncos and inspirational quotations. Gregory says he can tell how
well a girl has adjusted by how much she has plastered on her wall.

   Gregory said Excelsior girls have had an average of eight
previous placements in institutions such as psychiatric hospitals,
halfway houses and foster and group homes. The majority come out of
locked institutions.
   Most referrals to Excelsior come from county social workers and
school districts. A few wealthier students are placed privately by
their parents.
   The average stay at the school is 13 months, and there's a long
waiting list.
   Excelsior, a private association run by an 11-member board, is
funded mainly by counties, which pay a fee for each child placed at
the school. The fee for both treatment and school comes to about
$2,700 per month per student, which Gregory says is cheaper than
psychiatric hospitalization.
   ``In effect what we're doing is taking kids who've been in the
system for a long time. We're putting kids out of the system.''
   While residential child-care facilities are numerous, there are
only about 15 girls' schools in the country that offer the broad
program Excelsior does, Gregory says.
   Excelsior began its operation here in 1973 and runs on an annual
budget of $4.5 million, derived from the fees paid by counties and
from contributions. Because the state has imposed a three-year
freeze on county payments for child-care facilities, Excelsior has
been seeking more out-of-state students.
   It needs more help from the state, Gregory says, with the number
of disturbed adolescents and teen suicides rising. Meantime, fund
raising and a bond issue is to finance a new $700,000 building that
will include a 12-bed treatment unit.
   Originally isolated, the 33-acre campus now is surrounded by
homes and shopping centers. Neighbors have never complained about
the school, Gregory says.
   An accredited junior and senior high school, Excelsior offers a
licensed school of cosmetology and fields basketball, volleyball
and softball teams calling themselves the ``Eagles.''
   It also has a Treatment and Learning Center that can handle
severely disturbed students. Gregory says there are three or four
``incidents'' a month. There have been no suicides, ``but we've
come close.''
   The school's 170 employees include therapists, medical
personnel, teachers and counselors who live with groups of students
in cottages.
   Gregory calls the treatment ``re-parenting.''
   ``A lot of these kids missed good parenting in their important,
developmental needs,'' he says. ``We don't focus exclusively on the
psyche. We take care of the total child _ training in hygiene,
social skills.
   ``We as adults are in charge and these types of kids need good
healthy authority. It's not a punitive authority but a strong,
nurturing, parenting kind of authority.''
   Excelsior also emphasizes family therapy, sometimes flying child
and therapist to the parents' home in an effort to get the girl
back into her family.
   Gregory says about 85 percent of the girls who leave Excelsior
have completed treatment and are able to function independently.
   Liz's treatment coordinator, Murray Rodnick, says she was
seriously disturbed and self-destructive when she came to
Excelsior, but the school could reach her by offering ``an
incentive to work.''
   ``They realize the benefits come from taking responsibility,''
he says. ``Yes, a lot of terrible things have happened in your life
_ parental breakups, sexual abuse _ but the bottom line is you're
responsible for your life now.
   ``A Liz decides the payoff is in working, not in denying.''

   It's been more than 20 years since Richard
Chamberlain has starred in a regular television series, but he says
he's about to make a comeback.
   Not that Chamberlain has been a stranger to the tube. He has
been bouncing around the world the past few years filming
miniseries.
   In his latest, he co-stars with Jacyln Smith in ``The Bourne
Identity,'' based on Robert Ludlum's spy thriller, which ABC will
televise in two parts on Sunday and Monday.
   Chamberlain is now developing a regular series, his first since
he quit ``Dr. Kildare'' in 1966 and took off to England to shed his
boyish image and become a serious actor.
   ``We've hit on a wonderful idea, which I can't talk about,'' he
says. ``We took the idea to CBS and Lorimar and got a deal for 13
shows.''
   Chamberlain is quite ready to relinquish his title as the ``king
of the miniseries'' and have work that will keep him off the road.
   ``I'm tired of this gypsy life,'' says Chamberlain, just back
from four months in Europe filming the Ludlum story.
   ``I hadn't anticipated doing another series. But I wanted to
find a way to settle down. When you do a series you're at the
studio all the time, but you do get to go home at night.''
   Smith, the former ``Charlie's Angel'' who's known as the ``queen
of the miniseries,'' also doesn't want to travel as much now that
her children are approaching school age. She's looking for a comedy
series.
   About his role in ``The Bourne Identity,'' Chamberlain says:
   ``Jason Bourne is a fascinating character, very complex, very
divided. He's basically a scholar and teacher, but he has become
this terribly efficient undercover agent. The story begins when he
has been shot in the head and washes up on shore in the South of
France with amnesia.
   ``All he knows is that he has a Swiss bank account with $15
million and everyone is trying to kill him. Evidence begins to
build that he is the notorious terrorist Carlos. He takes Jackie
Smith hostage. Then they fall in love. She ends up saving him.''
   The story, like all of those by Ludlum, is terribly complicated,
but it has been simplified by screenwriter Carol Sobieski. It was
directed on location by Roger Young.
   ``There's a lot of mystery about the character,'' Chamberlain
says. ``Not only for the audience but for him as well. Carol has
taken the story and kept it clear and simple.''
   Filming started last year in Nice, on the Riviera, then after a
Christmas break moved to London, Zurich, Paris and back to Zurich.
   ``We were terrified before starting that Zurich would be 30
below zero,'' Chamberlain says. ``But we had an incredible break in
the weather. It was a very warm winter. Paris was more stunningly
beautiful than ever.
   ``We had a lot of phone booth scenes, because it figures in the
plot. We carried our own phone booth with us. We set it up in Place
Vendome, which is sacred to the French. People driving by couldn't
believe it.
   ``This is a very physical role. We had a lot of fights and car
chases. In Zurich I rescue Marie (Jaclyn Smith) from a fate worse
than death and get beat up in the process. We filmed six nights in
a row in Zurich. We had so many scenes with a streetcar that we
rented our own.''
   Before going to Europe, Chamberlain spent six months in New York
doing ``Blithe Spirit'' on Broadway.
   Most of his projects have kept him away from home. He was in
Japan for six months for ``Shogun,'' in Yugoslavia three months for
``Wallenberg,'' and in Africa for eight months for ``King Solomon's
Mines.''
   Other projects also took him many places. For ``Centennial,'' to
Colorado; for ``Three Musketeers,'' to England; for ``Cook and
Perry,'' to Canada, and for ``Dream West,'' to Arizona. ``The Thorn
Birds'' was the only miniseries filmed here.
   He's also developing a new theatrical movie based on the novel
``Say Goodbye to Sam.''

   Earle Hyman, best known for his TV role as Bill
Cosby's father, says the only place where he is truly recognized as
a star is in Norway, a country he loves.
   But Hyman is pleased with the reception he's getting on Broadway
where he recently took over the role of the chauffeur in the
Pulitzer Prize-winning play ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   And he says that playing the part of the chauffeur, Hoke
Coleman, is one of his favorite roles in his 45 years as an actor.
   ``I'm not leaving unless they fire me,'' says Hyman, 61. ``It's
a play that shows pure love coming from the strangest place. It is
the mystery of the human heart.''
   The play, written by Alfred Uhry and set in Atlanta in the years
from 1948 to 1973, opened in April 1987. Hyman followed the
original Hoke Coleburn, Morgan Freeman, in February. Frances
Sternhagen had taken over the role of Miss Daisy from Dana Ivey in
January. Ray Gill, the only other member of the cast, continues to
play Miss Daisy's son.
   ``Frances and I get entrance applause once or twice a week,''
Hyman says. ``It's heartwarming. I come from a time in the theater
when there were stars and we always applauded when they made their
entrances.''
   Only 287 people a night can be seated in the John Houseman
Theater to watch Hyman play Hoke but he's seen by millions in his
TV appearances on ``The Cosby Show.''
   His earnings from television enabled Hyman to buy a house in
Norway where he frequently appears on the stage.
   ``The only place I'm a star in the true sense of the word is
Norway,'' he says. ``There they come to see me and hope the play is
all right. I'm the only foreign actor and only black actor who
peforms in both Norwegian languages.''
   Hyman says that the first time he took a vacation, during his
five years at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford,
Conn., he visited Scandinavia. He wound up staying the entire three
weeks in Norway, the home of his longtime lady friend.
   ``The first time I stepped on that soil I fell in love with
it,'' he says. ``I felt I'd been there before.''
   In Norway, Hyman met the grandson of Henrik Ibsen, the famous
dramatist, who introduced him to theater people.
   Hyman was born in Rocky Mount, N.C. His parents, both
schoolteachers, moved to Brooklyn so their four children could be
educated in the North.
   ``I was the only black boy in the school,'' he recalls. ``The
pressure was awful; I had nowhere to hide. I'm glad I managed to be
the best. I had a photographic memory. I'd read things twice and I
knew it.''
   Hyman's father became assistant to the city parks commissioner
and designed the landscaping in Prospect Park and at the
Planetarium.
   ``It's very moving today for me to go look at those trees,''
Hyman says.
   ``Then the Depression came along and he was fired. He thought it
was because he was black. I'm sure he was right. It hurt him. He
became bitter about it, which is worse than being hurt, and he kind
of gave up.
   ``Down times came and we moved to poorer and poorer houses and
apartments. It pushed me straight into theater.''
   On his 13th birthday, Hyman took his girlfriend to see his first
professional play, Ibsen's ``Ghosts.''
   ``I rushed to the library the next day and read all of Ibsen's
plays,'' he says. ``My interest in Norway started there. I went to
the theater every week. Twenty-five cents it cost to sit in the
second balcony.''
   He attached himself to Mercedes Gilbert Black, who played in
``The Green Pastures.''
   ``I haunted her house,'' Hyman says. ``She sort of adopted me,
gave me pointers. There were no jobs for black actors.''
   Then a radio producer called the actress one day while Hyman was
there. He needed someone to play George Washington Carver as a boy.
Black told Hyman, then 16, to speak, pitching his voice high to
sound like he was 7. He got the job, but the producer was startled
when in walked a 6-foot-4 teen-ager.
   Hyman added an ``e'' to his first name, Earl, and in 1943 was
offered a walk-on part in ``Run, Little Chillun!'' on Broadway.
   It lasted two weeks but led to his appearance in the American
Negro Theater's ``Three's a Family.''
   Hyman decided to stay in show business after appearing in the
American Negro Theater's ``Anna Lucasta.'' ``This time we came down
to Broadway to stay and stay,'' he says.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' will be made into a movie, but Hyman
doesn't think he'll get the role because he hasn't done many
feature films.
   ``I really wish I'd done more movies,'' he says. ``Dore Schary
offered me a featured role in `Something of Value,' starring Rock
Hudson and Sidney Poitier. I turned it down. I felt I couldn't do
it well ... Sometimes in this business it isn't too good to be too
honest with yourself.
   ``I turned down a few other roles in movies because I love the
theater so much. What snobs we theater actors can be.''

   Rick Baker is an Academy Award-winning makeup
man, but not many stars would ask him for a touch-up before facing
the camera.
   Well, maybe Boris Karloff or Bela Lugosi. Lon Chaney would have
been delighted.
   Baker's specialty is creating movie monsters. He won the first
annual Oscar award for special makeup effects in 1981 for ``An
American Werewolf in London.'' Last month, he won a second Academy
Award for his makeup work in ``Harry and the Hendersons.''
   His work can be seen every Friday on CBS' ``Beauty & the
Beast,'' for which he created the face of the kindly Beast, Vincent.
   One of his most malevolent creatures stars in the NBC miniseries
``Something Is Out There,'' airing Sunday and Monday. Baker created
the ``something,'' a grotesque alien that comes to Earth and begins
a series of grisly murders.
   Joe Cortese stars as a detective investigating the strange
deaths. Maryam D'Abo co-stars as a mysterious woman he learns is
from another planet and is pursuing the creature.
   ``I started with a sketch, which I showed to the producer,''
said Baker, in an interview at his Glendale studio. ``Once we all
agreed, I did a clay mockup.''
   Two assistants hauled out the mockup, which was about 4 feet
long and looked like a mutant scorpion. It also has some spider
features and its back is covered with huge spikes, like a dinosaur.
   ``It's a space bug,'' Baker explained, ``and we call it Spike
because it has so many spikes. It's able to change appearance and
take over the body of its victims. We constructed a tail section
that's 12 feet long. The creature we built for the movie is much
nastier looking than this. It has a number of finger-like feelers
on its face, which makes it look like someone stuck a big spider on
his face.''
   With looks like that, imagine Spike's personality. ``It has a
terrible personality, if you can call it that,'' Baker said.
```It's really just a killing machine that's trying to survive.''
   Baker said it's much more graphic than what's usually allowed on
television.
   ``I don't know how much they'll allow on the air,'' he said.
``It was difficult to do and keep it acceptable.''
   At an age when most kids were playing cops and robbers or
cowboys and Indians, Baker was creating monsters.
   ``I already knew what I wanted to do with my life when I was
10,'' he said. ``I was fascinated by Frankenstein. I wanted to know
who made it. My father was an artist and he taught me a few basic
things. I bought books on sculpting and mold making.
   ``I lived in Covina, but I had no connection with the movie
business. That made it very difficult to get started. I grew up
working with grease paint, putty and making rubber masks.
   ``I was very shy and I found that when I made myself up I could
things I wouldn't do otherwise. Also, I loved to fool people. The
first time I did a gash on my arm, my mother thought I was really
hurt. I did a lot of blood-and-gore stuff when I was a kid. I
scared so many people I wasn't allowed in a lot of houses.''
   His first job, while still in high school, was making up stage
actors. Then he went to work for a stop-motion animation studio
making models for ``Gumby'' and ``Davy and Goliath.''
   ``I did my first film my second year in college,'' he said. ``It
was `Octo-Man,' part octopus and part man. I made the costume for
$500. I used almost all the money I got for the job to make it as
good as possible. After that, I never really had to look for a job.
People came to me.''
   His first major job was making Cicely Tyson look 100 years old
in ``The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman.'' He was only 20 and
won an Emmy.
   For the remake of ``King Kong,'' he made the ape suits and even
played the part of the big gorilla. ``They couldn't find anyone
else stupid enough to wear the suit,'' he said.
   He made most of the creatures in the cantina scene in ``Star
Wars,'' including the grotesque band.
   His study of gorillas came in handy for ``Greystoke: The Legend
of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,'' for which he made all the ape
costumes.
   ``I made 27 costumes,'' Baker said. ``I had to have different
heads, different hands. It took 10 months to do the suits with 90
people. We kept working right to the end of the picture. They
wanted people to think those were real apes. They weren't.''

   May 3, 1968.
   It began as any other Friday in Paris. People headed for work
with no idea that by nightfall blood would be in the streets, that
students would battle police in an insurrection destined to shake
French society to its roots.
   ``Nineteen sixty-eight was a cultural revolution in every sense
of the word. Afterward, nothing was the same,'' said Regis Debray,
then a radical and today an adviser to President Francois
Mitterrand.
   The month-long series of strikes, protests and pitched battles
nearly brought down the Fifth Republic of President Charles De
Gaulle. He resigned the following year.
   Two decades later, historians call May 1968 the greatest popular
uprising ever experienced by a capitalist democracy in time of
peace. The Events of May, as they are called, still reverberate in
French minds.
   Politics, schools, family life and work, art and popular culture
were transformed. May 1968 was a knife blade that severed past from
future, youth from authority, then from now.
   When the tear gas cleared, a new libertarian tolerance was in
the wind and the twin political pillars of Gaullist nationalism and
communism were permanently fractured.
   Debray said, ``It was a revolution in the way we live, a
transition from an old, rural France where everyone had great
respect for central authority toward a modern, urban France of more
liberal individualists.''
   The spasms of unrest in France were part of a common impulse
felt by a global generation, the affluent postwar children who,
from Berkeley to Berlin, focused their anger in protest of U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, the former French colony.
   Today, many of these angry young men are leaders of French
society.
   The flashpoint of the Events of May was the suburban campus of
Nanterre, where protests the preceding March led to the closing of
the school.
   On May 3, about 500 students staged a sit-in at the Sorbonne,
the old and respected university in Paris, to protest disciplinary
action at Nanterre. By late afternoon masses of riot police had
surrounded the Sorbonne and began making arrests.
   Students poured from Latin Quarter cafes with shouts of
``Liberez nos camarades'' (Free our comrades).
   Fighting began.
   A frantic administration shut down the Sorbonne, for only the
second time in 700 years.
   A week of shocking violence followed. Students erected
barricades of buses, felled trees, benches and streets signs. They
tore cobblestones from the streets and to hurl at police.
   Riot police clubbed students and chased them through narrow
streets, sometimes blocking medical help to the injured. Stinging
clouds of tear gas shrouded Left Bank neighborhoods.
   By mid-May the brutality had swung public opinion behind the
students.
   Writer Mavis Gallant, in her recently published diary, described
the morning after a violent clash that injured 367 students.
   ``Ripped streets around the Luxembourg Station. People who live
around here seem dazed. ... Paving torn up. ... Where I used to
live looks bombed. Burned cars, ugly, gray-black. ... Armed men and
unarmed children. ... We all feel sick.''
   Marc Kravetz, a leading student figure on the barricades and now
foreign editor of the newspaper Liberation, said the burning car is
the single image of the street fighting that endures in French
minds.
   ``The car was the symbol of middle-class achievement,'' he said.
``And bourgeois values were going up in smoke.''
   More than a million people formed a river of flags and banners
pouring down Left Bank boulevards May 13 and reports of
demonstrations came from college towns across France.
   Then, something even more astonishing happened.
   In a spontaneous wave that swept the nation, more than 9 million
people went on strike.
   Normal life in Paris came to a halt. It was impossible to buy a
newspaper, go to school, send a letter, cash a check, ride the bus
or subway, watch television or take a train. Frightened people, who
remembered World War II, began hoarding cigarettes, sugar and
canned goods.
   The difference between the strikes at Columbia University in
Manhattan and the Sorbonne in Paris was that the rest of New York
City barely noticed what was happening uptown at Columbia. Paris
was paralyzed.
   Garbage piled up in the streets. Teachers stopped teaching,
actors stopped acting. The Odeon Theatre was occupied by students
and workers holding marathon debates on creating a new society.
Even rugby players went on strike.

   The strikes marked the beginning of the end for the Communist
Party, which sabotaged the student movement, believing it an
uncontrollable revolt of spoiled, middle-class kids. But that
attitude permanently alienated intellectuals and youth and
contributed to the eventual election of Socialist president,
Mitterrand.
   More significantly, French politics had to deal with a new force
_ the media. Young people came to view television, radio and
newspapers as not just reporters of events, but tools for the
creation of events.
   Debray said one such creation was Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the best
known of the radical student leaders called Danny the Red because
of his rusty hair and provocative style.
   ``It was not Cohn-Bendit who organized the rallies or did the
concrete work,'' Debray said. ``But he was the one the television
cameras loved, so, whether he wanted to or not, he became a major
leader of the movement.
   ``Nineteen sixty-eight was the beginning of the media's conquest
of French politics and life.''
   Young people realized that all they needed was not a place in
the French Cabinet to be effective but two minutes on the evening
news.
   ``We stopped thinking in terms of traditional politics,'' said
historian Herve Hamon, once a student on the barricades and now
author of a history of the 1968 generation.
   Hamon said as his peers grew older, they indeed rejected
politics to pursue careers in medicine, teaching, the arts _ and,
above all, journalism.
   Cohn-Bendit, born in France of German parents, now publishes a
current affairs magazine in Frankfurt, West Germany. At 43, he
still lives the life of a free-lance radical, writing books and
working with West Germany's anti-establishment Greens party.
   ``I believe I can still legitimize everything I do from my
standpoint in 1968,'' Cohn-Bendit said in an interview with The
Associated Press, adding that events 20 years ago irrevocably
changed morality, sexuality and French education.
   Alain Peyrefitte, who as De Gaulle's Education Minister in 1968
considered Cohn-Bendit a troublemaker, now agrees with his
assessment of the events.
   ``I was against the movement and felt it was my duty to limit it
at the time. But I recognize that in the long-term the effects were
good,'' said Peyrefitte, now head of the editorial board for the
conservative newspaper Le Figaro. ``People became more responsible
for their lives, gained more dignity and felt more free.''
   On May 30, De Gaulle made a long-awaited radio speech,
reassuring French citizens, who were fed up with upheaval, that the
government was in control. Hours later, millions of Frenchmen
jammed the Place de la Concorde, waving the French flag. The nation
cooled down as abruptly as it caught fire.
   Under De Gaulle, a series of reforms came in late 1968 to
decrease the number of students in a classroom, increase personal
contact between students and professors and decentralize the
control of schools.
   Nineteen sixty-eight opened the door for the French feminist
movement in the 1970s and the introduction of legal reforms
governing abortion and contraception. Relationships between men and
women changed.
   The students of the barricades now are graying parents and
relationships between these fathers and sons are less formal, more
tolerant.
   ``In the marches of '68 you never saw any parents,'' said
Kravetz. ``In 1986, in the demonstrations against the education
reforms, parents marched beside their kids. There is greater
communication between the generations now.
   ``To understand what 1968 meant to us, you would have to have
seen what we were like before.''

   ``Germany isn't a land of
immigration,'' government officials like to say.
   But a massive influx of Turks and other foreigners has changed
the face of this once insular nation.
   From dozens of kebab stands in big cities to young Turkish
children playing in rural towns, the foreigners are making their
presence felt.
   Nearly 1.5 million Turks live in West Germany, the largest group
among the 4.5 million foreigners in a country with a total
population of 61.3 million. Frankfurt has a Turkish bazaar.
   Yugoslavs number about 590,000 and Italians are the
third-largest with about 535,000.
   One of the Turks is Nedzhati Baris, who has acquired a small but
successful business and an expensive home in the affluent town of
Koenigstein, outside Frankfurt.
   ``My position here now is quite good,'' he said in German at his
store. ``We are well known, since we've been here a long time.
   ``The only worry is bringing my mother for a visit from Turkey.
We've been waiting eight months for a visa.''
   The immigrant workers began arriving in the 1960s and 1970s and
were called Gastarbeiter, German for guest workers, to signify what
was to have been a temporary stay.
   Now, most of the Turks are still work on assembly lines or at
menial jobs shunned by West Germans.
   Journalist Guenther Wallraff's 1985 book on the exploitation of
Turkish workers, ``Ganz Unten'' (Rock Bottom), became a best-seller
and stirred controversy and soul-searching among West Germans.
   Federal and state authorities are trying to reduce the number of
foreigners in the country and make it more difficult for them to
bring in family members.
   But opposition groups say West Germany's economy, one of the
world's strongest, will need even more foreign workers in the
future as the German birth rate continues to drop.
   Although most Turks hold low-paid jobs, some of them are
successful businessmen. Turkish-owned travel agencies specializing
in trips to their homeland are mushrooming across the country,
cashing in on the West Germans' growing interest in Turkey.
   Turks, nevertheless, have been physically attacked by West
German extremist groups, and they face other problems.
   ``According to all our studies, the Turks by far have the most
difficult time integrating into the German society,'' said Hartmut
Reichow, an expert in the federal office for foreigners in Bonn.
   ``This has to do with their background: They have a different
religion (Islam) and come from a totally different culture,''
Reichow said in an interview.
   ``But the situation is much better now than it was in the late
1960s. Then, very few Turkish children went to school. Now, more
and more and are getting even higher education and their prospects
look much brighter.''
   Two high schools in Gelsenkirchen, a Ruhr Valley industrial
city, recently became the first in West Germany to offer the
Turkish language as one of the subjects for the ``abitur,'' the
examination that gives successful candidates a diploma roughly
equal to a junior college degree in the United States.
   The schools, whose student bodies are about a quarter Turkish or
Turkish-born, were the first to apply a long-existing law allowing
a foreign language to be one of the subjects in the final exam.
   Turks are also making their mark on cultural life.
   The Turkish-born director Tevfik Baser scored a hit two years
ago with his movie ``40 Square Meters Germany,'' a moving story
about a the wife of a Turkish worker forced by her husband never to
leave their tiny apartment in Hamburg.
   The leading role was played by Ozay Fecht, who came to West
Germany from Istanbul when she was 18 and became a critically
acclaimed actress and jazz singer.
   Another Turk, Saliha Scheinhardt, who married a West German,
advanced from a textile factory worker, waitress and air hostess to
prize-winning author, writing mostly in German.
   But it is the service sector where Turks and other foreigners
are beginning to play dominant roles.
   They run neighborhood ethnic restaurants and groceries, as well
as tailor and shoe-repair shops.
   ``Istanbul Kebab,'' ``Balkan Grill,'' and ``Italian Pizza'' are
found not only in large cities but also in many villages across
West Germany.

   In Koenigstein, a half-hour's drive northwest of Frankfurt,
grocer Baris explained that 15 years ago he traded his ice cream
parlor at Adana in the southern Turkey for an uncertain future in
West Germany,
   The 38-year-old immigrant started out as a waiter, then became a
factory worker and now owns the grocery store that doubles as a
tailoring and alterations service in Koenigstein.
   Like most Turks, Baris has no immediate plans to return home.
   ``If the economic situation in Turkey improves, then maybe some
day,'' he said.
   Baris' grocery store sells ornamented samovars and Turkish
coffee pots, water pipes, dried eggplant, Bulgarian goat cheese,
Greek olives, Yugoslav coffee, dozens of Turkish spices and mineral
water, and even casette tapes of Turkish music.
   Baris said 90 percent of his customers in Koenigstein are West
Germans. He opened his business five years ago and took a
250,000-mark ($148,000) loan to buy a house. Baris, his wife and
two Turks work in the store.
   All of Baris' four daughters were born in West Germany. Two of
them, aged 12 and 10, go to a German school. The two younger ones,
6 and 4 years old, go to a Roman Catholic-run kindergarten.
   In Frankfurt, Melek Kapicioglu followed a similar pattern. She
came to West Germany 22 years ago, as a 19-year-old girl. After
working on assembly lines for the electronics giant Siemens, she
opened a tailor shop in downtown Frankfurt five years ago.
   ``I have been here long and I don't really see how I can go back
to Istanbul and work in my profession,'' she said. ``In Turkey,
every woman knows how to sew.'' Both her grown-up children are back
in Turkey.
   Ms. Kapicioglu, also speaking in German, said she would like
West Germany to revise its law and extend business hours for stores.
   ``I work from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. I cannot serve customers legally
after 6.30 p.m., but I have to work long. My store rent is 2,000
marks ($1,200).''
   West Germany abounds with examples of Turkish and other foreign
influences:
   _In Frankfurt, kebab shops outnumber traditional sausage stands
around the main train station.
   _Newsstands sell Turkish, Yugoslav, Italian, and Spanish papers.
Hurriyet, a Turkish daily, is printed in a Frankfurt suburb in
120,000 copies daily and distributed across the country.
   _When floods hit many parts of West Germany recently, police
vans cruised the streets, broadcasting warnings in both German and
Turkish.
   _West Berlin's Kreuzberg district, with a large Turkish
population, has signs in German and Turkish to warn residents when
they approach the Berlin Wall that they are leaving the American
sector.
   _A cable television service in West Berlin offers Turkish
programs. West Germany's national television network has regular
weekly news and cultural programs in Turkish, Italian, Serbo-Croat
for the Yugoslavs, Spanish and Portuguese.
   _The Turkish bazaar in downtown Frankfurt features coffee shops
where patrons smoke water pipes, several restaurants, small stores
and a mosque on the second floor.
   Frankfurt's Turks hope to build a large mosque with donations
from believers.

<TEXT>
   Some beer fanciers have brushed off as a
passing fancy the popularity of Corona Extra, the biggest-selling
Mexican beer in the United States.
   Market experts questioned whether the light lager could compete
in an import market traditionally dominated by darker and heavier
European brews.
   Not so Valentin Diez of Cervecerias Modelo, the makers of
Corona. Under his guidance as Modelo's general sales director,
Corona has vaulted into second place among imported beers in the
United States, and the company is aiming to be No. 1.
   In the process, Grupo Modelo, the brewery's parent company, is
exemplifying President Miguel de la Madrid's controversial effort
to wean Mexican industry off years of subsidies and trade
protection to create an export-driven economy that can successfully
compete abroad.
   ``We want to be a model for all Mexican businesses by giving
prestige and credibility to Mexican products abroad,'' Diez said at
his Mexico City headquarters.
   A growing number of American beer drinkers are convinced.
   Americans consumed 25 million cases of Corona Extra last year,
more than double the 1986 figure and 10 times above that just six
years ago.
   Corona captured 18 percent of the U.S. import market in 1987,
second only to Heineken of the Netherlands with 25 percent,
according to Impact International, a New York-based publication
that monitors the beer industry.
   And with Corona now available in only 36 states, Grupo Modelo
directors have reason to believe they'll achieve their goal.
   Diez cited strict quality control, strong advertising and sound
marketing as reasons for Corona's export success. But it has been
sound financial planning at home that has steered Modelo through
Mexico's economic crisis.
   Tight credit, rising costs, slack consumer demand and crushing
private debts have hurt many Mexican businesses, including Modelo's
chief competitor, Cuauhtemoc of Monterrey.
   Modelo avoided these pitfalls by refusing to borrow to finance
investment, when borrowing from foreign lenders was the rage in the
late 1970s and early 1980s. The company continuously plowed its
earnings back into the firm.
   ``Grupo Modelo's policy always has been to grow using its own
resources. That means no debts,'' Diez said. ``We did it by
reinvesting all of our dividends over the years to construct our
own breweries, malt and glass producing firms, our own warehouses
and distributors.
   ``Many at the time thought we were wrong. But this policy has
allowed us to consolidate our leadership position in the Mexican
beer industry.''
   Modelo brands now account for nearly half the Mexican market and
60 percent of all Mexican beer exports, Diez said.
   Corona has been available in western U.S. states since 1966. But
sales growth was limited because a Puerto Rican brewery owned the
U.S. rights to the familiar Corona blue-and-white crown trademark.
   Cervecerias Modelo was able to arrange a concurrent use
agreement in 1983 and bought the trademark two years later.
   ``With the trademark question out of the way, this allowed us to
launch ourselves into the market,'' Diez said.
   Not quite.
   Modelo's governing board insisted on introducing the lager into
the U.S. market on a gradual basis rather than trying to flood it
all at once.
   Corona showed up first in restaurants and bars before it
appeared in liquor stores and supermarkets. The beer became
identified with trendy establishments and ethnic cuisine.
   ``They don't want to just open a market,'' said Roberto Viejo, a
sales director at Modelo. ``They work it, service it. It isn't
just, `Hey, here's a new brand.' No way.''
   Corona's popularity has benefited from a slick advertising
campaign, with its ``Cross the Border'' message linking the lager
to Mexican tourist attractions in magazines and on billboards.
   In Mexico, Modelo has pushed its premium beer at sporting
events. The beer's logo is found everywhere inside Mexico City's
Social Security Park, home to the city's Red Devils and Tigers
professional baseball teams, and at boxing arenas.
   The sports angle is being developed in the United States as
well. A promotional stint during the week of the NCAA college
basketball championships featured six Corona bottles, two of them
empty, and the slogan: ``On to the Final Four.''
   A U.S. Commerce Department decision to revoke trade preferences
for Mexican beer in 1987 didn't hurt Corona's sales growth.
Instead, the company judged it a sign that the brew could
successfully compete on equal terms with other American imports.
   So has President de la Madrid's administration, which cited
Cervecerias Modelo for export achievements. And Diez's colleagues
in the Mexican Association of Sales and Marketing Executives
designated him their distinguished executive of the year in 1987.
   Increased competitiveness means facing the prospect of more
imported beers in Mexico as well. A trade agreement signed with the
United States last year will allow many American beers in Mexico
for the first time.
   Diez is confident Modelo will rise to the challenge.
   ``We welcome them, having plain confidence that the quality of
our beers will allow us to freely compete with the best beers in
the world,'' he said.
   With new markets opening up in New York, New Jersey, Alabama and
the Carolinas this year, Diez predicts Corona sales will jump an
additional 15 percent.
   The company hopes its other leading export brands, Negra Modelo,
Modelo Especial and Pacifico, also will catch on with American beer
drinkers.
   Corona is making inroads in other countries. The lager was
recently introduced in Japan, and after just one year it is the
third-leading import by volume in Canada.
   Distributors in France, Spain, Belgium, Australia and South
Korea have expressed interest in Corona, Diez said.
   Viejo, the sales director, dismissed some experts' opinion that
Corona may already be falling out of the trendy import category in
the American market.
   ``I wouldn't worry about it as long as they keep talking about
it,'' he said. ``Corona is not in or out. It's a mainstream brand.''
   Corona did fall into the list of ``outs'' for beers in
BusinessWeek Magazine's trends list for 1988.
   The brew that took its place in the ``in'' column: Negra Modelo.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Sunset''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   No one is better qualified than Blake Edwards to create a movie
about the early days of Hollywood: He is a third-generation
filmmaker; his grandfather was a silent film director; his father
was an assistant director and production manager. His daughter,
Jennifer, a promising actress, makes it four generations.
   The latest movie from the prolific Edwards (``Breakfast at
Tiffany's,'' ``The Great Race,'' ``10'') is ``Sunset,'' an
affectionate, funny, exhilarating glimpse at what Hollywood in the
1920s might have been _ ``give or take one or two lies,'' as one of
the characters explains.
   Based on a book by Rod Amateau, Edwards' script contains a
delicious idea: the teaming of Wyatt Earp and Tom Mix to solve a
Hollywood murder case. The juxtaposition of an authentic Western
hero and a gaudy star of horse operas makes a splendid metaphor.
And Edwards adds another element from movie lore: the bootlegging
Mafia.
   The plotting of ``Sunset'' becomes a bit convoluted for easy
comprehension, and the heroics grow far-fetched. But the movie
rolls along with Edwards' faultless pacing, and most of all, by the
inspired casting of James Garner and Bruce Willis. They are the
slickest screen pairing since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.
   The two mythic heroes are brought together when Earp comes to
Hollywood as technical adviser for a movie in which he will be
portrayed by Mix. After an early antagonism, the pair develop a
mutual respect and visit a luxurious Hollywood brothel.
   When one of the leading ladies of the evening turns up dead,
Earp and Mix are plunged into a web of intrigue that leads to the
doorstep of studio head Alfie Alperin (Malcolm McDowell), once a
silent movie clown. Blake Edwards, who has a long history of
battles with studio bosses, must have delighted in making one one
of the villains of ``Sunset.''
   The story involves a wide range of characters, including the
dead woman's daughter (Mariel Hemingway), a crooked cop (Richard
Bradford), the oily studio police chief (M. Emmet Walsh) and an
underworld lord (Joe Dallesandro). They interweave, sometimes
confusingly, but most of the elements unweave at the end.
   Garner is a marvel to watch, his quiet authority dominating
every scene. But Willis also shows his best big-screen form yet,
capturing the flamboyance of Mix as well as his self-mockery.
   The Tri-Star Pictures release was produced by Tony Adams. The
rating is R, for language and sexual content. Running time: 101
minutes.

   Say it isn't so. But it is.
   Home videos for babies. We're talking infants here, not children.
   Well, why not. After all, there are books for babies _ those
soft, washable squishy things with big, bright drawings of animals
and toys and virtually no words _ so why not videos?
   V.I.E.W. Video, an acronym for Video International Entertainment
World, is releasing ``Infantasia _ A Musical Mobile for You and
Baby'' just in time for Mother's Day.
   The 25-minute videocassette in VHS sells for $19.95 and features
shapes, colors, animation and nursery rhymes a 5 or 6-month-old
baby or older could enjoy.
   There's a happy blue bird chirping away with moving musical
notes, and cute bunny rabbits cavorting on a sunny, verdant
landscrape. There are 11 songs including ``Pop Goes the Weasel,''
``Brahms' Lullaby'' and ``Three Blind Mice.''
   ``I've tried to create a world of color, shape and song which
would be both fun and learning for baby,'' said Dick Feldman,
president of Network Enterprises, who designed ``Infantasia.''
   Hi-Tops Video has a $14.95, 30-minute cassette for youngsters 5
and under called ``Babysongs,'' featuring such tunes as ``Don't
Wash My Blanket Today.'' From Pacific Arts Video for $19.95 is a
90-minute ``The Little Prince'' for kids 5-12. The Claymation
animation is based on the St. Exupery book.
   Elsewhere in the home video world, Paramount will release
``1900'' in June. The epic about the rise of fascism in Italy stars
Robert De Niro and is directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, whose ``The
Last Emperor'' recently won nine Academy Awards.
   Warner Home Video will release ``Nuts'' next month, starring
Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss in a courtroom drama.
   Videos reviewed this week: ``The Untouchables,'' ``Adventures in
Babysitting'' and ``Hiding Out.''
   
   ``The Untouchables'' (Paramount Home Video; VHS, $89.95@Beta,
29.95; Rated R)
   
   ``The Untouchables'' is much more than a stylish remake of the
old television series, even though good guy G-men still bust
Chicago ganglords during Prohibition.
   The Eliot Ness played by Kevin Costner is a teetotaler and
loving father who compromises his killing principles as he conquers
thugs who murder a 10-year-old girl with a bomb. He saves babies in
runaway carriages with one hand and tosses gangsters from buildings
with the other.
   The squeaky clean U.S. Treasury agent frets when he shoots
hoodlums, but he openly challenges mobsters and dutifully avenges
the murder of his friends. He fights the mob with accountants and
bullets, overcoming crooked cops and judges.
   The Al Capone played by Robert DeNiro appears too little in the
119-minute film, directed by Brian De Palma and written by David
Mamet. But the savage butchery of his criminal empire comes across.
   DeNiro's Capone is a a boss who keeps his troops in line with
bat-wielding brutality. He jokes with reporters, bribes the legal
system and cries at the opera at the same time he's being told of a
successful killing.
   Sean Connery won an Academy Award as best supporting actor for
his role as an honest cop who joins Ness. He offers this harsh
advice on how to beat Capone: ``He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.
He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the
morgue. That's the Chicago way.''
   Fashions by Giorgio Armani enhance the film's stylishness.
   It has an R-rating for language and graphic violence, including
a dinner scene with Capone that is not for the squeamish. But the
good guys win.

   ``Adventures in Babysitting'' (Touchstone Home Video; VHS@Beta,
$89.95; Rated PG-13
   ``Adventures in Babysitting'' is another adventure-comedy for
the teen set from the Disney Touchstone factory.
   Elisabeth Shue ( ``Karate Kid'') stars as Chris Parker, a high
school senior in a Chicago suburb who reluctantly agrees to babysit
for a neighbor's kids after her boyfriend stands her up. Then her
best friend calls in panic from the downtown bus station _ she has
run away from home, run out of money and begs Chris to come get her.
   So Chris and her three charges head down the expressway, where
they promptly get a flat tire, discover Chris has forgotten her
purse, fall in with a good-natured but impulsive tow truck driver
and get led into a series of ever-more unlikely predicaments,
mostly involving a sinister gang of auto thieves.
   The movie starts off promisingly, with a nice feel for the
middle-class suburban milieu and a disarming spontaneity that makes
you eager to see what weird thing will happen next. But as the
complications grow, screenwriter David Simkins begins relying too
much on stock situations, such as car chases and people hanging
from 40th-story windows.
   Before it all ends, with everyone safely tucked into bed, Chris
discovers that her boyfriend is a two-timing louse and has already
started a new romance with a kind-hearted college kid.
   Miss Shue, a lovely and spirited young actress, comes through it
all remarkably well, and the kids aren't bad either. A fair amount
of raunchy language explains the PG-13 rating.

   ``Hiding Out'' (HBO Video; VHS@Beta, $89.99; Rated PG-13)
   
   Some movies are a frothy treat on television, but a waste of
money and time in a movie theater. ``Hiding Out'' is one such flick.
   On the small screen, this comedy thriller starring Jon Cryer
(``Pretty in Pink'') is a fun diversion for teens hanging out
together on a rainy Saturday with a killer pizza and lots of
wonderful junk food.
   Cryer plays a stockbroker who is to testify about a mob bonds
scandal. Other witnesses have been rubbed out and Cryer is put
under federal investigation. His agents are as effective as Bozo
the Clown in protecting him and after one FBI agent is killed, he
escapes to an aunt's house, poses as a high school student named
Maxwell Hauser (he takes the name from a coffee can) and becomes
the most popular kid on campus.
   The fun _ and the adventure _ emerge as Cryer's split
personality as BMOC and fugitive stockbroker collide.
   There are a few laughs, some predictable gangster thrills and a
little romance. But don't expect major league acting. There are,
however, some pretty important values in growing up.

   George Gershwin: Rhapsody in Blue, Concerto in F _ William
Tritt, piano; The Cincinnati Pops Orchestra, Erich Kunzel
conducting.
   
   The popularity of George Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' owes a
lot to the orchestration prepared by Ferde Grofe in 1942. But there
was an earlier version, also Grofe's work, for Paul Whiteman's
``Experiment in Modern Music'' at the Aeolian Hall in New York in
1924.
   This was the version, and this was the concert, that established
``Rhapsody in Blue'' as an American standard.
   Whiteman commissioned Gershwin on the strength of the composer's
Broadway successes, notably ``Swanee'' for Al Jolson in 1920.
   Setting to work just a month before the concert, Gershwin wrote
a solo piano part and a second piano part which represented the
orchestra. Grofe then helped in orchestrating the piece for eight
violins, double bass, three woodwinds, two horns, two trombones,
tuba, tympani, banjo, celeste, percussion and piano.
   It is this orchestration which the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra has
recreated, using 24 players in the guise of the Cincinnati Jazz
Orchestra.
   It's a beguiling performance. Despite the digital clarity, the
small forces evoke the sound of old 78 rpm recordings and those
make-believe ballrooms of the early days of radio.
   Delightful though it is, the recording also affirms the
rightness of the more familiar 1942 version. In its final bars,
``Rhapsody'' begs for more oomph than two dozen players can muster.
   The Concerto in F, variations on ``I Got Rhythm'' and the
``Rialto Ripples'' rag, performed by the full pops orchestra, round
out a very satisfying hour-plus compact disc.

   ``Pinker and Prouder Than Previous'' (Columbia) _ Nick Lowe
   
   Forgive Nick Lowe for feeling a little baffled about what the
general public wants in its music stars.
   This veteran British rocker has done everything but jump through
hoops in an attempt to break through during the past few years. He
released two solid albums, including the exceptional ``Rose of
England,'' after a string of inferior early 1980s records. He
rerecorded one of his best songs, ``I Knew the Bride'' with Huey
Lewis and the News.
   Still, no luck. The back cover of his new album, ``Pinker and
Prouder Than Previous,'' shows Lowe standing against a brick wall,
gazing wistfully at a street sign called ``Market Place.''
   The relaxed tone of ``Pinker'' suggests Lowe has thrown up his
hands and just decided to do what's comfortable. While the results
are a few notches below his last two records, ``Pinker'' has its
moments.
   Lowe's a rock 'n' roller, as he constantly tried to reassure
fans who saw him on a solo acoustic tour last year, but he takes a
few intriguing left turns at the outset of this record. ``You're My
Wildest Dream'' is a roadhouse blues number backed by the Fabulous
Thunderbirds, and ``Crying in My Sleep'' is a rare ballad.
   He cajoles two fine contributions from friends who happen to be
sterling songwriters. ``Love Gets Strange'' is a John Hiatt
throwaway for which many songwriters would kill, and ``Black
Lincoln Continental,'' by Graham Parker, is a rollicking good time.
   Yet what's designed as this album's showcase is oddly
disappointing. Lowe briefly reunites with former Rockpile partner
Dave Edmunds, with whom he spent much of the 1980s feuding. But the
reunion is only for one song, and instead of complementing the
album, ``Lovers Jamboree'' stands uncomfortably apart.
   One hopes the slightly disjointed feel of this record doesn't
herald a return to Lowe's early '80s sloppiness. He's too much fun,
even when not at his best, to lose heart over a lack of commercial
success.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Demi Moore Graduates From Brat Pack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a reluctant member of the much-maligned
Brat Pack, Demi Moore has graduated to become a star in her own
right, a budding producer, wife of Bruce Willis of TV's
``Moonlighting'' fame and a future mother.
   These dizzying changes have somehow left the actress more serene
than ever. During a recent interview at Tri-Star Pictures, where
she occupies offices for development of screen projects, she seemed
calm and controlled, a 25-year-old confident of the future.
   Moore currently stars in ``The Seventh Sign'' as a pregnant wife
who is the central figure in a present-day threat of a biblical
apocalypse. The film has received a cool response from reviewers
and the public.
   ``A lot of people have commented that it might be in that genre
of films such as `Rosemary's Baby' and `The Omen,''' she said. ``I
don't think we set out for it to be that type of film. When I read
the script, the story always had an uplifting message, whereas
those other films always dealt with the devil and the concept of an
outside, evil force coming in and taking over.
   ``For me the only evil force in the movie is the human race and
what we're doing to ourselves.
   ``It's the first time I've had to carry a movie, and on that
level it was more challenging,'' she said. ``Also, it's a different
character, and the subject matter was much weightier. I've always
been associated with light, romantic comedies.''
   Moore said some of her roles, in such movies as ``About Last
Night'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire'' had ``moments of emotional depth
that had to be reached. Particularly, `About Last Night' exposed
that I was capable of more than just a frivolous, looking-good
(character).''
   Tri-Star thought so, and she is now developing a film project
based on a book she discovered. ``You just can't be at the studios'
mercy to bring you that ideal role,'' she said.
   Moore, whose parents spotted the name Demi in a fashion
magazine, had an unsettled childhood. She attended 30 different
schools as her advertising manager father moved to various
newspapers of a large chain. Her childhood curiously parallels
those of other young stars such as Tom Cruise and Rebecca De Mornay.
   ``That experience definitely has something to do with how I
ended up here,'' Moore said. ``When you move around a lot, you're
always having to adjust and fit in, meet people and situations.
   ``I've talked to a number of people who have had similar
experiences, Rebecca being one. I don't quite know what it is.
Maybe it's just being able to adjust, fit in, cope, create whatever
you need to survive, make it work.
   ``There are two choices: You can become introverted, isolated
and alone; or you can become extroverted and put yourself out there
and try to fit into the group so you're not alone. I don't think
that always leaves you with a great sense of yourself or of
security.''
   Moore chose to be extroverted, and at 16 she dropped out of
school to become a model. She had the flawless beauty, but at 5
feet-5{ inches, not the height. So she took acting classes and at
18 landed the role of Jackie Templeton on the TV soap ``General
Hospital.'' Her first major film role was in ``Blame It on Rio,''
in which she appeared topless as Michael Caine's headstrong
daughter.
   More films followed: ``No Small Affair,'' ``St. Elmo's Fire,''
``One Crazy Summer,'' ``Wisdom.'' In the latter, she co-starred
with Emilio Estevez, who was then her fiance. Last Nov. 21 she
married Bruce Willis in Las Vegas, Nev. She said their baby is due
in late summer.
   Moore was well prepared for her pregnancy. To research ``The
Seventh Sign,'' she talked to pregnant women and obstetricians and
visited delivery rooms.
   ``It was a lot of fun for me,'' she said. ``I had a leotard suit
with a belly that weighed 10 to 15 pounds. I wore it for two weeks
before the film started, to get the feeling, the walk. People
responded to me differently.
   ``I also had a prosthetic device which was sculpted of rubber
and took six hours to apply, gluing it to my skin. Thank God I only
had to wear it four or five times.
   ``For me it is much more exciting that I got to play pregnant
and make it so realistic, and now to have the real thing happen.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Soprano Worked Overtime As Met Season Wound Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She's a bird! She's a maid! She's a flirtatious
landowner! She's a kid sister!
   She's Dawn Upshaw, supersoprano, and during the final weeks of
the Metropolitan Opera season, her sweet, lyric voice seemed to be
piping up all over the place.
   ``If anybody had told me I was going to be doing what I did this
season, I'd have been flabbergasted,'' Miss Upshaw said in a recent
interview. ``It was very draining.''
   What she did, within the space of two months, was sing the
off-stage role of the Forest Bird in Wagner's ``Siegfried''; the
comic housemaid Despina in Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutte''; Adina, the
heroine of Donizetti's ``The Elixir of Love''; and Sophie, the
younger sister of Charlotte in Massenet's ``Werther.''
   ``It's not something I would want to do very often _ so many
different things all at once,'' she said. ``The preparation was not
the problem; it was more concentration.''
   The centerpiece of all this activity was four performances as
Adina, by far the biggest role the 27-year-old soprano has sung at
the Met, and one she almost didn't sing at all.
   ``I was the cover (understudy) for Kathy Battle, and supposed to
be singing the smaller role of Giannetta,'' she said. ``The night
of the first performance I was on my way out the door at 10 to 7
when I got the call saying Kathy was sick and could I please go on
as Adina.''
   The same question had been put to her last fall when illness
forced Judith Blegen to cancel a run of Adinas.
   ``They gave me a choice of going on, but it was a new role, a
new style for me,'' she said. ``I thought, `No, I'd better wait.'
They were very nice, they didn't pressure me to rush in.''
   In February, Miss Upshaw decided she was ready _ and the critics
agreed.
   ``The result was a highly successful, charming performance, as
might have been expected from one of the most critically admired
singers of her generation,'' wrote John Rockell of The New York
Times.
   She drew equal praise for the other roles she sang in her
late-season burst. As Sophie, declared the AP's Mary Campbell, she
displayed ``a voice as fresh as spring.'' As Despina, said Times
critic Will Crutchfield, she was ``a joy to the ear.''
   Despina put her in the midst of a backstage drama that Miss
Upshaw would just as soon forget. The Korean soprano Hei-Kjung Hong
_ another budding Met star at age 29 _ had been scheduled to sing
the opening performance. However, according to some accounts, the
evening's star, soprano Kiri Te Kanawa, expressed displeasure and
demanded that she not join the cast until the second performance.
   ``All I know is, someone I know there called and asked me,
`could you come in, we don't think Hei-Kjung's quite ready for the
first performance,''' Miss Upshaw said. ``It's not something I'd
care to discuss with Hei-Kjung. Our friendship is just as it was
before. This didn't have anything to do with the two of us.''
   Though this was Miss Upshaw's fourth season at the Met, most of
her previous appearances were in tiny roles, starting with a debut
as the Countess Ceprano in Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
   ``I think I had two lines,'' she recalled.
   Verdi is not a composer of whose works she expects to sing a
lot. Miss Upshaw describes herself as ``a lyric soprano, but the
quality is not strictly soubrette,'' meaning she is well-suited for
parts more substantial than the traditional comic maid.
   ``But my voice is not heavy enough for Puccini, not even Mimi
(in `La Boheme'),'' she said.
   There was a time when Miss Upshaw, who grew up in the Chicago
suburb of Park Forest, had her sights set no higher than singing
jingles in TV commercials.
   ``While I was in high school I worked as a secretary for a
jingle producer,'' she said. ``I thought: `this looks good. People
come in, sing for five minutes, go home, and that's how they make
their living.''
   Her plan was to study singing in college and become an expert
sight-reader, a requirement for professional jingling. But when she
went to Illinois Wesleyan University, she discovered the world of
classical music and began to think of a somewhat loftier career.
   David Nott, her voice teacher at Wesleyan and the school's
choral director, encouraged her to attend the Manhattan School of
Music in New York after she graduated. There she studied with Ellen
Faull, a former opera singer and highly respected teacher.
   During the summers, she made the rounds of American music
festivals, such as Aspen and Tanglewood, studying with established
singers and developing a reputation of her own as an up-and-comer.
She also attracted the attention of the Met, which put her into its
informal internship program for young artists.
   ``Like many singers of my age, I didn't have to work for years
in Europe before being accepted here,'' Miss Upshaw said. ``I think
maybe Americans are becoming very proud of our own singers.''
   Next year's Met schedule calls for her to be just as busy as
this season, ``but it'll be more spread out.'' She'll repeat the
Forest Bird, Sophie and Giannetta and also sing Ilia in Mozart's
``Idomeneo.'' Down the road, she will be Zerlina when the Met
stages its long-awaited new production of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni.''
   When not singing at the Met, Miss Upshaw _ who makes her home in
New York with her musicologist husband _ keeps busy performing solo
recitals and singing at major European summer festivals, including
Salzburg and Aix-en-Provence.

<HEAD>Music Makers: A Former Doll Is Hot, Hot, Hot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some rockers turn gray, still rocking. Not David
Johansen.
   The former New York Doll got tired of rock and the road. So he
put some brilliantine on his still-dark hair, worked it into a
Little Richard pompadour, donned a tuxedo and became a jaded lounge
lizard named Buster Poindexter.
   He became the toast of Manhattan with a slick deco act that best
resembled a collaboration between P.G. Wodehouse and Noel Coward.
And the songs he did were novelties and saloon tunes with witty
anecdotes.
   He played at a club called Tramps with his five-piece Banshees
of Blue, and moved to the Bottom Line with his 11-piece Banshees of
Blue. Then he went national. ``Saturday Night Live'' snapped him
up. He was interviewed on ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny
Carson,'' signed for ``Miami Vice'' and appeared in ads for
Amaretto liqueur.
   His new album for RCA, ``Buster Poindexter,'' has been on
best-selling charts for months. ``Hot Hot Hot,'' a tune he once
heard on a Caribbean vacation sung by a calypso king named Arrow,
was the first single. His newest single, also borrowed, is ``Oh Me
Oh My,'' which was recorded in 1925 by the New Orleans Owls.
   And Buster Poindexter is playing dates in much nicer rooms than
David Johansen ever did.
   ``I like places where your feet don't stick to the floor,'' he
said. ``Until I had the album, there was no going out as Buster
Poindexter. People wouldn't come. You can have the greatest show on
Earth but if they haven't heard of you they're not going to come
out and see you.''
   The 38-year-old Johansen explained the reasons for his new
persona: ``I'd been doing a straight rock 'n' roll show for many
years and I got tired of it. I think I outgrew it. I wanted to do
something a little more sophisticated and something I could
entertain people of all ages with, instead of just kids.
   ``As solo performer David Johansen (after the 1973-75 New York
Dolls heyday), a lot of things I would say were going over the
audience's heads. Now I'm in a situation where I can be funny. It
is very satisfying.
   ``Every year you're singing rock you get older but the kids stay
the same age. Buster is suitable entertainment for all ages. People
who like rock like Buster.''
   He chose the ``obscurities from days gone by'' for the album.
``The reason I started doing Buster Poindexter was, I wanted to
sing all these songs I've cataloged in my head. ... It wasn't like
I seriously expected to do this.
   ``I didn't stop doing the other thing and start doing this. I
started Monday nights at Tramps. I said I was Buster Poindexter so
they wouldn't come expecting to see David Johansen's schtick. For
six months maybe I was singing as both. It was a natural
progression. Now guys on the street go, `Yo, Buster.'''
   Johansen is married to portrait photographer Kate Simon.
   He started in show business in the campy, gay theater troupe,
Charles Ludlum's Ridiculous Theater, and moved on to become lead
singer in a campy, male rock group, the New York Dolls, who wore
high heels and makeup.
   ``I guess I was a precocious kid,'' he said in an interview.
``Most of the people in my family sing, dance, are always in plays.
I was the least inclined in that direction. I'm the one who took it
up as a profession. Now my mother comes to my shows all the time
with her friends.''
   His Norwegian father, who died three years ago, was a light
opera singer who became an insurance salesman when he and his Irish
wife had the first of their six children. ``We always went to see
Broadway shows when we were kids,'' Johansen said. ``I liked them
all.''
   At home on Staten Island, David Johansen's street name was
Buster.
   ``I was the one in the gang who read books,'' he says. ``They
called me Poindexter. Some people have that wanderlust both
physically and intellectually. I had a band in high school, the
Blue Banshees. I wanted to revive that name, for whatever reason
I'm not sure.''
   After high school, he worked for people who owned a store. One
of them was in the late Charles Ludlum's theater company. ``I just
kind of fell into it. Charles Ludlum was a brilliant man, very
generous with his information. I learned a lot. It was like an
apprenticeship. I was a lion in one play, a saint in one. I was an
extra, really.
   ``Then I started up the New York Dolls. At that time rock was
very blue jeans and flannel shirts. We wanted to bring a sense of
flamboyance, fantasy and fun to it. The way we dressed scared the
homophobes (people afraid of homosexuals).
   ``We got involved with each other because we looked like that.
... I don't think we thought what we were doing was particularly
outrageous. I think it translated that way. We made two albums for
Mercury, released many times _ the best of, very best of, complete
works of.
   ``It has been said the New York Dolls were the beginning of
punk. I don't agree. I think it was classic rock 'n' roll we
played. I wrote lyrics that were teen angst with a sense of humor.''
   Johansen said the New York Dolls broke up because they got tired
of each other. ``We were very volatile. We'd have an argument; that
would be it. Most people would say, `We still have this viable
gig.' Not us. We were amateur, I guess.
   ``In retrospect, it was a project that was completed. I don't
want to go around looking like that forever. I see grown men still
wearing their mother's clothes. I say, `There but for the grace, go
I.'''
   After the breakup, Johansen and another band member made money
touring Japan _ Johansen now calls them the Dollettes. Then he
wrote songs and made six solo albums for Epic, continually touring
the United States for eight years.
   ``I love to sing,'' he says. ``It's the schlep that kills me.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: On Foot Through the Rain Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eric Hansen has vivid memories of the split second
it took to make the decision: turn his back on civilization and
return to the Borneo jungle he had just spent five months crossing
on foot.
   Six years after his marathon trip, other memories continue to
haunt Hansen, who relates his experiences in his new book,
``Stranger in the Forest _ On Foot Across Borneo'' (Houghton
Mifflin Co., $17.95).
   He recalls his brush with death with former headhunters
convinced he was an evil spirit, and his fantasies about
cross-country skiing while trudging through the hot, leech and
insect-infested rain forest.
   Departing from Kuching in the west in May 1982, Hansen made a
2,500-mile journey through uncharted rain forest to Tanjungselor in
the east and back, carrying only a bed sheet, a change of clothes
and barter goods.
   He had the company of guides for much of the time, but also
traveled alone. He emerged a changed man, a spear-wielding hunter
and a gatherer whose Western sense of time had washed away.
   ``After spending five months in the jungle, I wasn't fully aware
of how much I had changed,'' Hansen said. ``Then I went back two
more months, and I had changed even more.''
   In Singapore, his first real exposure to civilization
afterwards, ``there was all this traffic and the pollution ... and
I was acutely aware of the fact that there were no trees at all.
And I felt much more uncomfortable coming back into Western society
than I had going into the jungle.''
   Civilization lost its terrors within about two months for the
author. But long-term changes remain to this day.
   ``I'm much more patient, much more resilient. ... It's very much
developed my self-confidence,'' he said in a recent interview.
   The Borneo journey was not the first adventure for the
40-year-old Los Angeles native, who has traveled to Nepal and
northern Afghanistan. He also has worked as a goldsmith, a buffalo
catcher and as a barber for Mother Teresa's home for the destitute
in Calcutta.
   Like his other experiences, Hansen said that the decision to
embark on a rain forest odyssey was compulsive.
   ``I think a lot of us fantasized about a place we want to go or
a situation we would like to be in and most of us are quite happy
to keep it on that fantasy level,'' he said. ``I thought about
going to Borneo for five or six years and it became an overwhelming
desire on my part.''
   Hansen's 278-page book is at its most fascinating when it
juxtaposes civilization against the rain forest and its creatures _
the author among them. Among such vignettes is an episode
describing the aftermath of a wild boar hunt with parangs _ heavy
knives:
   ``Squatting on my haunches, I could feel the fat running down my
forearms and dripping from my elbows. I was totally absorbed in the
meal when I heard a vaguely familiar droning sound growing louder
and louder.
   ``I looked up through a gap in the jungle canopy and saw, for
perhaps five seconds, a commercial airliner.
   ``I imagined myself sitting on the plane. ... Far below, at the
edge of a small clearing, almost hidden from sight, I could see
myself seated by a campfire with two brown-skinned jungle men,
speaking an unknown language. Nearby lay the steaming carcass of a
wild boar.
   ``From that perspective I suddenly realized what an astonishing
situation I was in: submerged in a sea of giant trees, hunting wild
animals, a bloodied parang at my waist _ the stuff of pure fantasy
six months earlier.''
   Hansen's encounter with American missionaries and his decision
to retrace his steps is perhaps the keystone episode and clearly
explains the triteness of ``civilization'' to a man grown
accustomed to harsher realities.
   ``Ian and Julie were perched nervously on the edge of their
seats staring at me, perhaps waiting for me to disappear. I looked
at the Christian paintings, calendars and framed scriptural quotes
that covered the walls. I had been in the jungle too long to make
any sense of them.
   ``All these symbols seemed trite and out of place. And their
puppy. That sweet-smelling freshly shampooed, little bundle of
white fluff would have been torn to pieces in thirty seconds by the
village hunting dogs.''
   Hansen chuckled as he thought back to that time.
   ``They had this little bungalow beside the jungle and inside the
house was a perfect time capsule,'' he said. ``Everything about it
was ridiculous, from the soap to the rugs, to the cookies in a jar.
I was convinced that it had been brought by helicopter and just
dropped there.''
   In the book, he presents the forest and its inhabitants at their
most frightening on his return trip, when he ignored the locals'
advice and embarks alone during ``the season of fear,'' the former
time for headhunting, when evil spirits lurk.
   Hansen was mistaken for a ``bali saleng'' _ half man, half
spirit who kills for blood and who cannot be killed.
   ``What I did not know was that the description of `bali saleng'
changed regularly,'' he writes. ``At the time ... the description
was `a tall, white-skinned man with brownish hair who walks by
himself in the jungle.'''
   His book describes several close calls with frightened natives,
including one hair-raising encounter where he was stripped and
cross-examined for hours, until he laboriously convinced his
interrogators to let him free.
   Hansen said his journey left him none the worse for wear and
that he is looking forward to his next project _ an extended tour
of rugged North Yemen.
   The slightly built, balding adventurer laughed heartily when
told that he did not seem physically rugged enough for such
experiences.
   ``I think there's a myth, fed by movies and television that it's
the hairy-chested, gun-slinging, whip-wielding individual that ...
conquers the mountain, or the river, or the woman or whatever,'' he
said.
   ``In fact, I've never seen anyone in real life like that get
very far ... because they're the first ones to get sick, or
complain or freak out when something happens.
   ``When they can't scream or pay somebody off, they give up.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Wolfman Jack Has New Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack says
his new cable TV show spotlighting the golden era of rock 'n' roll
rivals his old hit show, ``The Midnight Special.''
   The Wolfman, who portrayed himself in the 1973 movie ``American
Graffiti,'' is the host of ``Rock 'n' Roll Palace'' on The
Nashville Network. The 30-minute program is taped at Little
Darlin's Rock 'n' Roll Palace in Kissimmee, Fla.
   The bearded host says he does not missing doing ``The Midnight
Special,'' of which he was host for eight years, because the new
program is so good.
   ``We have very special and wonderful people,'' the 49-year-old
Wolfman said in an interview. ``We had a magic and it comes out on
the tube. The show comes on and goes off fast. Everyone was
inspired and wanted to be there and wanted to perform. It was very
magical.''
   Guests this season include the Diamonds, the Shirelles, Tommy
Sands, the Coasters, Del Shannon, Brian Hyland, Joey Dee, Lou
Christie, the Crystals, Bobby Vee, Martha Reeves, Mary Wells,
Johnny Tillotson, the Platters, the Crickets, Lenny Welch, Freddie
Cannon, Spencer Davis, Billy J. Kramer and the Tokens.
   ``On TV, there's not one show going after these acts,'' the
Wolfman said. ``This is the first show to come along and do this.
   ``It's real American music _ what rock 'n' roll originally was
before people turned it around and sideways and upside down. From
1958 to 1964, that's real rock 'n' roll. Then the Beatles hit and
everyone sounded like them. They didn't give our boys long enough.
There were real classics from that era.
   ``The feeling of some of the music today is a little bit like
that (era), but the purity of rock 'n' roll when it first came out
was astounding,'' she said. ``It was pure, simple, nothing heavy,
nothing but fun and romance. It had a good beat and you could dance
to it. There were great ballads in those days.''
   The Wolfman, who has a syndicated radio show on about 70
stations, said music today emphasizes the performer rather than the
song.
   ``You don't go see Michael Jackson for the song but for his
great entertaining and dancing. You see a $2 million show. In the
old days, you paid $2-$3 and saw 18 acts. Back then, everyone
worked together. You try to put 18 acts together today and see what
it costs you.''
   The Wolfman said he has many fond memories of ``The Midnight
Special,'' which he left in 1982 because the show was
de-emphasizing live music, he said.
   ``There were some fine moments. I remember Ray Charles and
Aretha Franklin and Billy Preston and at the end of each show we'd
jam. This was very unusual for those days. For us to put them all
together was very important.''
   The Wolfman really is Bob Smith, who grew up in a tough
neighborhood in Brooklyn, N.Y. His character emerged in the 1960s
from XERF, a Mexican station with a signal that carried into the
United States. He later was on XERB, another Mexican station.
   Then he appeared in the George Lukas movie ``American
Graffiti,'' which starred Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison
Ford and Cindy Williams, and briefly featured Suzanne Somers.
   ``It took the Wolfman from a cult figure to the rank of American
flag and apple pie,'' he said. ``It made me legitimate. Most actors
go all their life and try for that kind of opportunity. The Wolfman
stumbled and fell into it. I am very lucky.
   ``So many people got started in that picture. It sort of became
a classic.''
   He's not so complimentary of a later movie, ``The Big Chill,''
which also featured '60s rock.
   ``It was kind of depressing, being about a funeral and all. But
it did depict different kind of people in that age group. But I
didn't particularly care for it.''
   After ``American Graffiti,'' he began doing various advertising
campaigns and appeared in more than 40 network TV shows. He also
had his own syndicated TV show, ``The Wolfman Jack Show.''
   Todd Rundgren, the Guess Who, Leon Russell and Freddie King all
wrote songs about him.
   He currently is a deejay for radio station XTRA Gold in San
Diego, Calif., broadcasting from his home in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   His voice, he said, has been very valuable to him.
   ``It's kept meat and potatoes on the table for years for Wolfman
and Wolfwoman. A couple of shots of whiskey helps it. I've got that
nice raspy sound.''

<DATELINE>BIG SUR, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just before sunset, a golden glow warms
the Big Sur coast where Highway 1 crosses Bixby Creek on a bridge
so graceful it improves its idyllic natural backdrop.
   California native Richard Sears visits the area a half-dozen
times a year just to stare at the stunning scene.
   ``I feel attached to this place,'' he says in a reverent tone.
``I lived in Europe for 20 years. All the time I was gone, I kept
dreaming about this particular highway, this particular spot.
   ``That's why I came home eventually.''
   Sears is not alone in his enthusiasm for the wonders of
California's 644-mile coastal highway. If you picture California in
your mind, chances are you are viewing it from Highway 1.
   Maybe it's the sight of surfers silhouetted against a Santa
Monica sunset, or the brightly colored fishing boats chugging out
of Morro Bay. Perhaps it's the grandeur of Big Sur, or the quaint
Main Street of Mendocino. If these are the jewels of the California
coast, Highway 1 is the necklace.
   It became the nation's first scenic highway in 1964, when the
separate segments of the route were linked under the common name of
Highway 1.
   The journey north begins at Dana Point in Orange County when the
Pacific Coast Highway peels off from Interstate 5. A chain of beach
towns makes up this land of surfboards and string bikinis: Laguna,
Newport, Hermosa, Redondo, Manhattan, Sunset, Santa Monica.
   Yachts take harbor at Newport Beach. Laguna Beach attracts
artists. Huntington Beach is perforated with oil wells. Everywhere
there are whitewashed walls of Spanish-style villas, red-tile roofs
and dangling boughs of purple bougainvillea.
   The highway rolls past Venice and the famous Santa Monica pier
en route to Malibu, where celebrities mingle with common folk. It's
expensive. The traffic is often jammed. The land is not stable.
Grass fires threaten hillside mansions in the summer. Monster waves
damage beachfront homes in the winter. Yet most people who live
here wouldn't trade it for nirvana.
   Highway 1 passes through the lima bean fields and lemon orchards
of Ventura County as it heads up towards Santa Barbara. At Gaviota,
it heads west on a journey through time that takes it from cow
pastures into the space age. Giant radar domes and distant launch
pads mark Vandenberg Air Force Base, the future home of the space
shuttle.
   San Luis Obispo was the site of a California mission, later
became a quiet college town and today is an oasis for motorists.
With the Spanish-influenced architecture of its relaxed downtown,
it proves an excellent tonic for those too long behind the wheel.
   Ten miles west is Morro Bay, and a little farther up the coast
lies San Simeon, where William Randolph Hearst built Hearst Castle.
The dozens of bedrooms in the main house once welcomed the likes of
Gable and Lombard, presidents and kings. The mountaintop mansion is
now a state park.
   The highway now enters Big Sur, 70 miles of coast where the
dramatic Santa Lucia mountains drop suddenly to the sea.
   The highway dances with the mountains here, rising around a
point high over the ocean, then falling gracefully into a sweeping
curve before spinning again toward the sea.
   The deepest canyons are crowned with arching concrete spans
built, like other parts of the highway, with the help of convict
labor from San Quentin prison.
   The beauty of the 714-foot Bixby Creek Bridge belies the
difficulty of its construction from 300 tons of steel, 6,600 cubic
yards of concrete and 300,000 board feet of Douglas fir used as a
falsework.
   Even though 1.5 million people drive through Big Sur each year,
the scale of the landscape generates a feeling of isolation for
some. The greatness of the area has inspired many writers and
artists, including author Henry Miller and photographer Ansel Adams.
   A half-hour north of Bixby Creek sits reclusive
Carmel-By-The-Sea, and a few miles farther rests Monterey with its
once-bustling waterfront that now features one of the world's great
aquariums.
   This is no longer the Cannery Row that John Steinbeck
immortalized a half-century ago. But millions still come here
searching among the crumbling piers for the ghosts of Doc and Wide
Ida.
   The highway races past Fort Ord on its way to the amusement park
at the Santa Cruz boardwalk, where a warm summer night conjures the
smell of cotton candy and the cheap thrill of a rickety wooden
roller coaster.
   Another 70 miles of coastline leads the highway to San Francisco
where the route's beauty is lost is a maze of traffic until
resurfacing across the Golden Gate in Marin County. The highway
clings to the shoulders of Mount Tamalpais before reaching the
funky communities of Stinson Beach and Bolinas.
   For many, a trip along Highway 1 on the north coast will seem
redundant after the scenery further south. But the observant will
find extraordinary beauty in the lagoons and grasslands that have
become refuge to myriad species, including red tail hawks and
peregrine falcons.
   Passing through the towns along the north coast _ Bodega Bay,
Mendocino, Fort Bragg, Gualala (pronounce it wuh-lah-lah) _ it is
hard to imagine one is still in the same state as the sun-'n'-surf
cities of Southern California. Soon, even the Northern California
coast is a memory as the highway turns inland through virgin
redwood groves and Indian reservations.
   At Leggett, the highway comes to an anti-climactic end when it
meets Highway 101, and the traveler has the option of continuing on
the more heavily traveled road _ or turning around and seeing what
Highway 1 looks like from north to south.

<TEXT>
   On a bluff with a sweeping view of the
Big Sur coast, 808 feet above the Pacific Ocean, sits a restaurant
that serves something more with its burgers than a side of fries.
   Nepenthe has been a popular eatery on Highway 1 since the late
1940s, not just with the 1.5 million motorists who pass by
annually, but with many of the writers, artists and thinkers who
have given Big Sur its unique reputation as the birthplace of the
human potential movement.
   The restaurant, designed by Rowan Maiden, a Frank Lloyd Wright
disciple, makes the most of its view with a dining room surrounded
by picture windows and a wrap-around, bi-level patio. Inside and
out, there are giant fireplaces to ward off the chill of the
notorious coastal fog.
   The food, ranging from quiche and burgers to steaks and red
snapper, is good and not unreasonably priced by Big Sur standards.
But it's the history and people of Nepenthe that really makes the
place special.
   The restaurant, named for a mythical Egyptian drug that induced
forgetfulness and eased sorrow, sits beside a log cabin built by
the equestrian Trails Club in 1925.
   The cabin was purchased by Orson Welles in the 1940s, reportedly
as a gift for Rita Hayworth. But she never lived there and the
property was sold again to Bill and Lolly Fassett in 1947.
   Today, Nepenthe is managed by their grandson, Kirk Fassett.
Granddaughter Erin Fassett supervises the dining room and lives in
the rustic cabin.
   Born and raised in Big Sur during the 1960s, they had a good
view of social changes here, and of the changes in people who gave
up the straight life somewhere else to seek an alternative
lifestyle on the California coast.
   ``In Big Sur, there is really only one industry, the
entertainment industry _ restaurants and inns,'' notes Erin. ``So
people who wanted to live here, unless they were independently
wealthy or self-employed, ended up working in restaurants.
   ``I know people who have Ph.D.s or were doctors and didn't want
to be doctors anymore _ people who dropped out of a different life
and were working here. And that's still true ... These people have
gone through a real rebirth in a way, a rejuvenation. They get
excited about life again,'' she said.
   ``Every night, somebody comes through and says `I came here 10
years ago and I was never able to forget it.' It's really kind of a
haunting community. You don't forget it very easily.''

<TEXT>
   When Gov. Bob Martinez drove a 1929 Ford Model AA
truck to open the final 33-mile stretch of Interstate 95 last Dec.
19, it marked the end of a superhighway project that began snaking
its way from Miami to Maine 32 years ago.
   The idea for the road was born in the 1940s as a way to speed up
troop movement, when needed, while aiding the burgeoning East Coast
population. It was included in a national interstate network
outlined in 1956 in the Federal Aid Highway Act signed into law by
President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Ambitious plans called for the entire network, 90 percent funded
by the federal government, to be carrying traffic by 1972.
   It was designed as an unbroken freeway, but its 1,866 miles are
interrupted in central New Jersey, where there is a short gap near
Trenton. The interstate picks up a few miles later, where it shares
the New Jersey Turnpike. Plans for completing I-95 in New Jersey
were scuttled in 1983.
   I-95 now runs through all or parts of 15 Eastern states and the
District of Columbia, from Miami to Houlton, Maine.
   In parts of the heavily-traveled Northeast, I-95 often becomes a
traffic nightmare.
   Howard T. Owens, a state senator from Bridgeport, Conn., and
chairman of the General Assembly's Transportation Committee,
describes the situation on Interstate 95 in Connecticut as
``absolutely horrendous.''
   ``It's gridlock from 6:30 a.m. to after 8:30. A ride from
Bridgeport to Stamford that should take 25 minutes takes more than
one hour, and if every aspect of mass transportation was used by
the year 2000, we'd still have hopeless gridlock,'' Owens said.
   Work on the $222 million final leg in Florida began in
Jacksonville in February 1985 with money appropriated by Congress
three years before. The last link runs from northeastern Palm Beach
County into Martin County, loops west across the Florida Turnpike
and then meanders back toward the coast to connect with what used
to be a dead-end stretch of the highway in St. Lucie County.
   During several years of construction, the then-incomplete
portion of I-95 became a favorite runway for drug smugglers.
   ``It became the longest runway in the United States for drug
smuggling planes,'' James D. Holt, the sheriff of Martin County,
said when the link was opened in December.
   In Florida, Interstate 95 offers easy access to all of the
Atlantic beaches and is little more than an hour away from Disney
World, Sea World and many other Central Florida attractions.
   ``I didn't know whether I'd live long enough to see it complete
or not,'' said Bill Fowler, of the state Department of
Transportation, who helped oversee work on the ``missing link.''
   Some officials say completion of the section between Palm Beach
and St. Lucie counties in southeastern Florida will open the
Treasure Coast to commuter traffic from as far away as Miami.
   ``You figure a two-hour commute to Miami really isn't any worse
than what some people do to get from one end of Miami to the other,
or Fort Lauderdale,'' said Martin County Commissioner Maggy
Hurchalla.
   But Lance deHaven-Smith, associate director of the Florida
Atlantic University-Florida International University Joint Center
for the Study of Environmental and Urban Problems, sees it as one
more step in ``the Los Angelization of South Florida.''

<TEXT>
   Interstate 95, the 1,866-mile corridor
that takes truckers, snowbirds and salesmen from Maine to Florida,
begins at the Canadian border in this far north potato town.
   Before reaching Bangor, the nearest big city, I-95 winds through
miles of potato farms, brushes the Haynesville Woods _ made famous
by Dick Curless' country and western hit, ``Tombstone Every Mile''
_ then passes through a strand of white birches before cutting
through the brooding Argyle peat bog.
   Remote and isolated, the only access to points south before the
opening of the two-lane highway in 1966 were state Routes 2 and 2A
_ hilly, winding, treacherous roads, particularly in winter. Then
the trip to Bangor could take up to four hours, and had to be a
well-planned event.
   ``We would go only a couple times a year,'' recalls Lois Ward,
62, who has lived her entire life in this Aroostook County
shiretown of 6,750. ``We'd leave early in the morning, do our
shopping, have dinner and it was probably 10 o'clock at night
before we were home. It was an all day thing, but it was grand
fun.''
   Today, the interstate is a four-lane highway and the speed limit
65 mph, which has cut the driving time to Bangor in half.
   ``It was a godsend as far as getting to the southern part of the
state,'' lifelong area resident, Robert Anderson, 50, said of the
highway. ``The interstate can't be equalled in my opinion,
anywhere.''
   The opening of the interstate has increased traffic into the
United States from Canada.
   When I-95 first opened _ two miles from the Maine-New Brunswick
border _ 4,900 people a month entered the United States. By 1987,
273,000 people and 5,000 trucks a month were streaming into the
country, according to Marc Russell, U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service supervisor at the border checkpoint.
   The interstate, which cost $140 million to build from Bangor to
Houlton, also created a new business district, forcing motels,
restaurants and stores from downtown Houlton or Route 2A to close
or move near the highway to accommodate the re-routed traffic.
   Some believe business has increased in Houlton, where the
economy is based on the potato industry and the lumber trade.
   ``There seems to be more activity in Houlton than there has been
in prior years,'' said Anderson, an insurance and real estate
agent. ``Maybe that's just a gut feeling, but there seems to be
more construction. I think development around an interstate seems
to snowball.''
   While the road has made access to southern Maine easier, life in
Houlton, as one resident says, hasn't changed much.
   ``It's just a long way from the rest of the world,'' Mrs. Ward
said. ``Even though you can get to Bangor in just under two hours,
you still have a long way to go if you want to go to Boston.''

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once called the Hermit Kingdom, South
Korea is preparing to entertain the world at the 1988 Olympic Games
and show just how much things have changed.
   The country, which for centuries tried to seal itself off from
the world, has been transformed in recent years into one of Asia's
most modern and fastest-growing nations. Staging the Olympics is
the crowning glory of South Korea's economic rise.
   Seoul, a sprawling city of 10 million people, has been preparing
for years to host the Games and ensure that everything is right
when the Olympic spotlight turns on South Korea beginning Sept. 17.
   The city of high-rise buildings, broad avenues and meticulous
neatness is dotted with Olympic flags and banners for the Games.
The five interlocked circles, symbol of the Olympic movement, is
stamped on everything from milk cartons and television logos to
carriages in the Seoul subway system.
   ``The No. 1 games. The No. 1 people,'' proclaim the subway signs
on every carriage door.
   Counters ticking off the days to the start of the games stand
outside all government offices and police stations, in every subway
station and in many shops and businesses. Some buildings even have
little counters in the elevators.
   Newspapers are filled with articles on the Olympics, Seoul taxi
drivers are taking courses in English and other foreign languages,
homeowners are being urged to provide accommodation for tourists,
and hotels and new shops are under construction all over Seoul.
   The sprawling Olympic Park in the south of Seoul, with its giant
stadiums, tracks and pools, is ready for the Games. Workers scurry
around the immaculate complex every day, polishing the stadiums and
trimming lawns and trees.
   But visitors hoping to attend the Olympic Games had better
already have firm hotel and airline reservations. Accommodation is
likely to be scarce with more than 200,000 visitors expected.
   Visitors who want to get the real flavor of Korea should get off
the main streeets and take a walk through the sidestreets and
alleys that are usually just one block over. Street life in Seoul
is colorful and entertaining.
   Little shops offer brightly colored quilts and basketwork,
antique dealers sell old pottery and elaborate Korean chests. Stall
holders are everywhere selling fruit, vegetables and flowers.
   Sidewalk vendors or little makeshift restraurants offer onion
pancakes, rice noodles in red pepper sauce and jam and almond paste
cakes, roast chestnuts and dried squid.
   Koreans like to socialize over food and drink and Seoul is
covered with thousands of restaurants, beer halls, tea rooms, snack
counters and sidewalk vendors serving a vast range of dishes.
   Korean food offers distinctive spicy dishes such as pulgogi, a
barbecued beef that is cooked at your table, and kalbi or barbecued
beef ribs. Kimchi, fiery pickled cabbage that is the most famous
dish in Korean cuisine, accompanies just about every meal.
   Another pleasure are the many small and inexpensive noodle and
rice restaurants where a steaming bowl of fish or beef soup can be
had with noodles or rice for $2 or $3.
   Many visitors enjoy sampling both local brews and Korean society
by visiting Korean beerhalls, where local beers and a potent
sorghum liquor called soju are served. Koreans love to sing and
strangers and friends join in everything from country and western
hits to haunting Korean love melodies.
   Seoul has much to offer shoppers, with bargains in clothes,
luggage, shoes and leather goods, porcelain, Oriental prints,
fabric, and inexpensive jewelery. Several fur companies offer
bargain fur coats that shoppers pick up at the airport on their way
out.
   The city is covered with shops, department stores, arcades and
markets. Many visitors head for the Itaewon District, where English
is widely spoken.
   More colorful are the vast open air markets at Tongdaemun and
Namdaemun where vendors sell everything from sneakers and bolts of
brilliantly colored silk to live carp and turtles for dinner.
   Foreign visitors invariably say language is the biggest problem
they encounter. English and other foreign languages are not widely
spoken. But Koreans will happily assist guests and smiles, nods and
hand gestures are often sufficient.
   One problem confronting Olympic visitors will be very strict
security that could make getting around difficult at times during
the Games.
   The government, concerned about possible terrorist threats from
rival communist North Korea, will deploy tens of thousands of
troops and police to ensure the safety of the Games and the
visitors.

   The Seoul metropolitan government has established a Home-Stay
Program involving 668 Korean families to cater to foreign tourists
expected for the Olympic Games in September.
   Part of the preparation for the host homes involves learning
Western-style cooking.
   ``The basic price of the Home-Stay Program ($25 a person per
night) includes breakfast and, obviously, most Western visitors
will not be used to the Korean-style morning meal of soup, fish,
rice and kimchi (a spicy cabbage dish),'' said a city government
official.
   ``We want to be able to offer them the kind of breakfast dishes
they are used to at home. That's no problem in our city's hotels _
but perhaps a new cooking experience for some Korean housewives.''
   The homes in the program, which is operated by the Korea Travel
Bureau, include traditional Korean-style houses and modern
apartments.

<DATELINE>PUERTO AYORA, Galapagos Islands, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dolphins, their
bodies luminous in the black sea, swam alongside the bow in the
dark, moonless night, playfully racing our sailboat as it cut
through the water on the second night of our trip to the Galapagos
Islands.
   A few hours later, they frolicked just outside the porthole of
our cabin, waking us up with their high-pitched whistles, seemingly
to watch their midnight antics.
   By then, we were hooked on the wonders of these fascinating
islands, located some 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador in the
Pacific Ocean and populated with strange and unusual birds,
reptiles and animals.
   ``These islands are a unique entity, related to no other part of
this planet,'' writes Tui De Roy Moore in her book, ``Galapagos:
Islands Lost in Time.''
   ``They contain mountains, forests, beaches and bays unlike any
others on the earth,'' she said. ``Here animals and plants have
evolved into unique forms; some have survived scarcely changed,
from prehistoric times.''
   Indeed, a visit to the islands _ there are 13 large ones and
dozens of small ones and reefs spread over about 18,000 square
miles _ is to go back in time.
   Charles Darwin, the English naturalist, visited the islands in
1835 aboard the ship Beagle. His observations were key in
formulating the theory of evolution.
   In his book ``Darwin and the Beagle,'' Alan Moorehead quotes
Darwin as saying about the islands:
   ``Here, both in space and time, we seem to be brought somewhere
near to that great fact _ that mystery of mysteries _ the first
appearance of new beings on this earth.''
   That sense of mystery remains.
   Gray-black swirls and coils left by flowing lava at the turn of
this century, still virtually intact, stretch eerily as far as the
eye can see at Sullivan Bay on Santiago Island.
   Marine iguanas, their heads like armored helmets shaped at the
dawn of time, sun their grayish bodies on rocks at James Bay, also
on Santiago Island.
   The giant tortoises _ the name Galapagos comes from the Spanish
word for tortoise _ lumber across the landscape, much as their
prehistoric ancestors did. They are the world's largest, a ranking
shared only with a species on the Seychelles, the islands in the
Indian Ocean.
   Sailing in a 48-foot yacht, we were able to visit six of the
islands in five days and see a wide variety of animals, birds and
reptiles in their natural habitat as well as hike over volcanic
terrain.
   The trips are regulated by the Galapagos National Park Service,
which limits visitors to 26,000 a year. Tourists are restricted
where they can walk so they don't disturb the islands' ecology.
   We slept and ate aboard the yacht. Food was prepared by a cook
who used local products to make such Ecuadorean specialties as a
mashed potatoes and cheese dish called llapingachos, ceviche topped
with popcorn, and desserts of sweet tomatoes.
   A guide approved by the park service traveled with us, pointing
out blue-footed boobies, lava herons and swallow-tailed gulls by
day and constellations by night.
   Never having been threatened by humans, the islands' creatures
are extraordinarily tame. Nearly all were unfazed by our presence.
   Enormous colonies of sea lions, some swimming, others sparring
and one even nursing a pup on South Plaza Island, let us walk
gingerly among them without scurrying away.
   Some even turned the tables and inspected us.
   A young sea lion pulled himself out of a shallow pool at James
Bay to get a closer look. With his tiny ears alert, he sniffed a
friend's white jogging shoe before slithering away to dry off on a
warm cliff.
   A tiny penguin darted around us, swimming as we snorkeled in
beautifully clear water near Pinnacle Rock on Bartolome Island. A
pelican, maybe hoping for some leftovers from our cook, perched
atop the motor on the dinghy behind our yacht.
   A few creatures were decidedly unfriendly, and we weren't
certain about the intentions of two sharks spotted circling one
night when our becalmed yacht stalled for more than an hour during
a long sail in the deserted waters between two islands.
   The captain of our boat reassured us that Galapagos sharks were
special, like the islands' other creatures. ``Vegetarians,'' he
said with a big smile.

<DATELINE>POKHARA, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Men and women with heavy loads on their
backs trudge the roads of Pokhara. Some are trekkers _ Americans,
Europeans, Australians _going up into the mountains. Others are
Gurung tribesmen coming down with loads of cloth or grain.
   Pokhara, 124 miles west of Katmandu, owes its existence to the
majestic sweep of half a dozen Himalayan peaks to the north. It
calls itself ``Gateway to Annapurna,'' after the tallest at 26,504
feet.
   It is crowded with young tourists chattering about treks and
older ones waiting hopefully for frequent clouds and mist to part
for a glimpse of the snowy peaks.
   It was not always so. In fact, says retired British Col. J.O.M.
Roberts, Pokhara was once one of the world's most isolated places.
   ``Anything you can see here, cut it down. It didn't exist,''
Roberts said, recalling his initial visit as one of the first
Westerners into the Pokhara valley in 1950.
   Nepal was closed to tourists until 1951, and the ony way to
Pokhara was to walk. French climber Maurice Herzog, the first
European to conquer a major Himalayan peak, bypassed the place en
route to his conquest of Annapurna I on June 3, 1950.
   Roberts said that on his second visit in 1957, he saw only an
airstrip and a tree. Even the oxcart, ubiquitous in south Asia, did
not arrive in Pokhara until 1961, brought in by aircraft.
   Today, where only rocky paths existed, a string of villages
makes up the town of Pokhara. Corrugated tin shops, thatch shacks
and concrete-block houses have sprung up willy-nilly.
   About 70,000 people live in the area. Many are Gurungs or Mayars
who came down from the hills to settle after seeing the outside
world in the famed Gurkha regiments in which Roberts also served.
   D.B. Thapa of the government tourist office said 70,000 visitors
also come to Pokhara each year.
   But natives and foreigners rarely collide, since tribesmen do
their business in the Mahendra Pul area north of the airport, and
Westerners hang out near Lake Phewa to the west.
   At the native bazaar, most signs are in Nepali script, though
the Shakva Tailors advertises ``Satisfaction Is Our Garent.'' A
search for books in English turns up only ``Basic Chemistry'' and
similar texts.
   The lakeside, by contrast, is a bibliophile's dream: 16
bookstores can be found in a 15-minute walk, with titles in a
half-dozen languages traded or sold by wandering readers.
   At one shop, the Bible in German shares a shelf with ``I'll Take
Manhattan'' by Judith Krantz, Tolstoy's ``War and Peace,'' and
``Annapurna, Premier 8,000,'' Herzog's tale of his conquest. Nearby
are books on mountains and mysticism, along with Batik versions of
the Tantric erotic art carved on Nepal's Hindu temples.
   The rest of the lakeside is a similar international jumble: the
Amica German Hair Composer, Axis Steaks and Pizza, the Monsoon
Restaurant _ Japanese food, and Tranquility Lodge offering
``harmony, peace and good energy.''
   ``You can get a room in Pokhara from 15 rupees to 1,500
rupees,'' _ 70 cents to $70 dollars _ said Ranga Nath Timilshina,
19, who was hawking the Amrit Hotel, four rooms each with bath
added to his family's lakeside home.
   A friend, 22-year-old Madabah Prasad Neupane, leaned on his
bicycle and mused about changes since Pokhara's hotel boom began in
the late 1960s. ``People here used to be farmers. Now they find the
hotel business is an easy way to get money,'' he said.
   Roberts grumbles about the ``concrete mess'' of today's Pokhara,
but his trekking service here makes him part of the place. He even
has a role in one supposed legend of the ersatz town.
   One guidebook relates how an expedition that Roberts led in 1957
to climb 22,958-foot Macha Pucchare _ Fishtail Peak, the nearest to
the town _ turned back because Sherpa guides feared the wrath of
the ``mountain goddess.''
   Not so, said Roberts. The Sherpas had no superstitions, and it
was two British climbers who were forced to quit about 150 feet
from the top.
   ``We were beaten by the mountain,'' he said.
   ``It's still not been climbed,'' he added. ``It's nice to have
something untouched.''

   Conner Prairie, one of the nation's
most authentic 19th-century villages, is adding something new: a
state-of-the-art, $10.5 million museum center.
   The museum center will open May 7 with a two-day celebration.
   Conner Prairie, six miles north of Indianapolis, depicts the
lives, times, attitudes and values of Indiana's first settlers. It
stretches over 250 acres and attracts 200,000 visitors annually.
   ``You're in your own historical novel or personal John Wayne
movie,'' said Frank Werner, who supervises the museum's
documentation. ``People who know nothing of the 1830s come out here
and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in the history. We awaken
people to the realities _ good and bad.''
   The museum center will house a permanent gallery, temporary
exhibition hall, audio-visual program, restaurant, 100-seat
theater, library, classrooms and administrative offices.
   ``The center has been designed as a complement to the village,''
museum smokeswoman Brenda Myers says. ``It's a modern visitor's
center meant to augment what's outside. The village is real, so why
imitate?''
   Open since 1974, Conner Prairie features ``citizens''
interpreting everyday events from a 19th-century perspective.
Visitors are encouraged to participate in hands-on activities as
they circulate among the town's 30 authentic buildings.
   ``Kids can poke around and play here and that doesn't happen at
most historic sites,'' Myers said. ``There are so many generic
living history museums and `no touch' places out there. That's what
we want to avoid.
   ``We encourage active participation because we want visitors to
get not only a sense of how people lived, but how they felt. How
better to learn history?''
   Werner said family members of all ages enjoy chatting with the
more than 100 history interpreters at Conner Prairie and joining
them in weaving, making soap, cooking, working with wood and
playing pioneer games.
   ``You can't describe what the interpreters do as acting,'' said
Werner, who also participates in the role-playing. ``It goes beyond
acting. You're recreating social, political, cultural and emotional
circumstances.''
   He also underlined the museum's success in educating visitors _
in some cases _ despite themselves.
   ``People expect the typical history museum where everything is
`over there' and roped off,'' Werner said. ``But here, no one's
lecturing you. People's hesitancy breaks down and they become a
part of the village. We impart factual knowledge without their
knowing it.''
   Evening concerts on the prairie, candlelight walks and
hearthside suppers are among the special programs scheduled
year-round at the museum. Families can also relive the pioneer
experience by reserving a rustic cabin on the prairie or by
attending horse races, weddings, funerals and political debates in
the village.
   ``We generally have funerals in the fall, because that was the
cholera season. We aim to make visitors feel and understand that
these are real people, not just historic figures,'' Myers said.
``Everything here has to be tried and true and confirmed by at
least three sources.''
   International pharmaceutical heir Eli Lilly originally purchased
the property in 1934. With his wife, he restored the original
William Conner home, decorating it with period antiques before
donating it and the surrounding farmland to Earlham College in 1964.
   Conner, a frontiersman, trader and statesman, was instrumental
in developing central Indiana during the early 19th century.

   For travelers with a special interest in American history, in
rediscovering American roots, there are numerous book guides to the
past.
   Among them is the lavish Reader's Digest ``America's Historic
Places,'' published this spring ($26.95). It is an oversized travel
guide and reference book to 500 locations throughout the country,
including historic battlefields from Gettysburg, Pa., to the Alamo;
mansions like the Wentworth-Coolidge mansion in Portsmouth, N.H.,
and Beauvoir, the spacious cottage in Biloxi, Miss., where
Jefferson Davis lived the last 12 years of his life; and monuments
from the national capital's Washington Monument to Iowa's Effigy
Mounds, the Hopewell Indian burial sculptures.
   The well-illustrated book has travel-planning details, such as
when places are open and how much they charge, as well as
background text on the sites, listed according to regions.
   Another travel book focusing on America's history is
``Experiencing America's Past,'' a paperback guide to restored,
re-created and reconstructed museum villages (Wiley Press, 1986,
$12.95).
   Authors Gerald and Patricia Gurek list some 40 places from Old
Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Mass., a re-created New England
town of the 1830s, to the Greenfield Village and Henry Ford Museum
in Dearborn, Mich., an indoor-outdoor museum dedicated to the
automobile. However, the book deals only with places beteween the
East Coast and the Midwest.

   ``Dixieland was a big cheaply constructed frame house of 18 or
20 drafty high-ceilinged rooms: it had a rambling, unplanned
gabular appearance.''
   In Thomas Wolfe's autobiographical first novel, `Look Homeward,
Angel,'' ``Dixieland'' was the fictional name for the place called
Old Kentucky Home, a boarding house run by his mother in his
birthplace of Asheville, N.C. Wolfe moved into the boarding house
when he was about 6 years old.
   ``The construction was after her own plans,'' Wolfe wrote of the
house, ``and of the cheapest material: it never lost the smell of
raw wood, cheap varnish and flimsy rough plastering.''
   Wolfe's mother, Julia (the Eliza of ``Look Homeward, Angel'')
bought the house in 1906 for $6,500. She renovated it, added rooms
and a sun porch and rented to traveling salesmen, vaudeville
performers, school teachers, and others. Her business cards
advertised, ``Large Lawns, No Sick People, Rates Reasonable.''
   Wolfe's father, W.O., refused to become a part of the enterprise
and stayed at the old family home on Woodfin Street, now a YMCA.
   The boarders provided Wolfe with much material for his novels.
   ``Look Homeward, Angel'' shocked Asheville residents of the
time, who objected to the unvarnished, thinly-disguised portraits
of those in Wolfe's fictional town of ``Altamont.'' The book was
banned from the local Asheville library.
   But today, there's renewed interest in Thomas Wolfe _ the 1988
Pulitzer Prize for biography went to David Herbert Donald for
``Look Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe'' _ and Asheville, N.C., is
saying you can go home again.
   The 28-room boarding house at 48 Spruce St. (Spring St. in
Wolfe's novel) is now a literary shrine, open to the public, with
formal tours ($1 admission).
   A ``Living History'' attraction is featured this May 14-15, with
role players at the house wearing period costumes of 1916, the year
Wolfe left Asheville to attend the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill.
   ``We try very hard to present the house and its inhabitants
exactly as they were back then,'' says Steve Hill, site manager of
the Wolfe Memorial. ``The costumes of the people playing the role
of boarders are specially made to assure their authenticity.
   ``Once visitors enter the home, they will think they have taken
a trip back in time to 1916. Even the music we play is from that
time period.''
   The house reflects the early 1900s with furnishings and many
personal effects intact. An upstairs bedroom contains Wolfe's
belongings from his New York apartment, including clothing, a
writing table and typewriter (which he never used, preferring to
write in longhand).
   Wolfe, also the author of ``Of Time and the River'' and ``You
Can't Go Home Again,'' among others, died in 1938. The 50th
anniversary of his death will be marked with a special program at
the home in September. In October, there will be an open house to
commemorate his birthday.
   Another tourist site in the area is the Biltmore House, the
George W. Vanderbilt mansion built in Asheville in 1885 by
architect Richard Morris Hunt and landscape designer Frederick Law
Olmsted.
   Touted as ``the largest, grandest residential estate ever built
in America,'' the Renaissance-style chateau has 250 rooms and 17
acres of gardens. Built as Vanderbilt's dream house in the
mountains outside of Asheville, it originally encompassed 125,000
acres.
   After Vanderbilt's death in 1914, part of the estate was deeded
to the federal government to form the nucleus of the Pisgah
National Forest, part sold for a section of the Blue Ridge Parkway
and part incorporated into the residential town of Biltmore Forest.
   The house museum is open for tours and now includes the Biltmore
Winery.
   Asheville is the largest city in western North Carolina, bounded
by the Blue Ridge Mountains to the east, and the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park about 50 miles to the west along the border
with Tennessee.

   The consumer uprising by air travelers appears
to be easing a bit as the 1988 summer travel season approaches.
   Complaints about airline service, though still coming into the
Transportation Department at the rate of several thousand a month,
have eased as airlines try to eliminate what irritates travelers
the most.
   Under government pressure, the major air carriers have scheduled
flights more realistically, eased the bunching of flights around
busy travel times and funneled additional manpower and money into
dealing with their customers.
   ``Much of the confusion and inconvenience is behind us now,''
said Stephen Hayes, vice president for public information at the
Air Transport Association, the airline trade group.
   Hayes acknowledged past problems, but suggested in a recent
speech that the airlines are determined to provide better service.
   Cornish Hitchcock, legal affairs director for the Aviation
Consumer Action Project, a public interest group that keeps tabs on
aviation issues and has been critical of the industry in the past,
also suggests that perhaps the worst consumer problems in aviation
may be over.
   At least, he says, there may not be ``the indifference to the
plight of passengers'' that marked 1987 as far as many of the major
air carriers were concerned.
   ``I'm not sure you can declare victory yet,'' said Hitchcock in
an interview, adding that the test is likely to come as the busy
summer travel season begins.
   For millions of people who travel by air, 1987 often became a
nightmare. In June of last year, the Transportation Department
received as many complaints about air travel as it had received in
all of the previous five months. Members of Congress began talking
of re-regulating the industry and on more than one occasion unruly
passengers stormed a ticket counter because a flight had been
canceled or they faced long delays.
   The turmoil and pressure from Congress caused the Transportation
Department to get tough with the airlines.
   They were told to stop scheduling flights unrealistically,
knowing that delays would result. And in a major change the
airlines were told beginning last September to make detailed
reports to the government about their on-time performance as well
as complaints about mishandled bags and problems with overbooking.
   After six months of such reports, it became clear that even in a
good month about one-fifth of the flights by 14 major airlines are
likely to be late. The airlines worst performance came last October
when one-third of the flights were late.
   Today the on-time record of each flight can be provided by a
travel agent or airline reservation clerk through the reservation
computer. A code shows how often a flight has been on time in the
previous month, although a customer normally must ask for the
information.
   But travelers so far have not availed themselves to such
information on a wide-scale basis, according to travel agents.
Furthermore, some critics have argued that the information is of
minimal value because often a traveler has little choice as to
which flight to take to a particular city.
   Many members of Congress want more detailed consumer reporting
by the airlines, but consumer legislation aimed at the airlines has
been bogged down in a dispute over testing airline employes for
drugs.
   Airline opposition is strongest to provisions in pending
legislation that would require the Transportation Department as
well as airlines to provide toll-free telephone lines for consumer
complaints; provide free tickets for lost baggage; require that
tickets be refundable; and require airlines to establish a minimum
time for flights.
   These provisions if approved would force the cutback of service
and harm consumers, the airlines have argued.
   Meanwhile, the airlines are not yet certain what _ if any _
problems will develop this summer from two new requirements from
the Federal Aviation Administration.
   A new regulation that bans smoking on flights of two hours or
less could unleash not only confrontations aboard aircraft but
prompt a range of complaints about enforcement.
   Furthermore, neither the airlines nor travelers have gotten
accustomed to carry-on baggage restrictions that went into effect
at the beginning of the year.
   As the busy travel season begins both the smoking and baggage
rules are likely to result in at least some friction, says
Hitchcock.

   Groups that represent the handicapped are
eagerly awaiting a Transportation Department regulation _ expected
within a few months _ that they hope will clarify their rights
aboard commercial airliners.
   People who must use wheelchairs or are blind have complained for
years that they are being discriminated against and often
embarrassed when they travel by air.
   The battle lines between the handicapped and the airline
industry have at times been tense. According to the National
Federation of the Blind, there have been more than 20 blind people
arrested and taken from aircraft because of disputes over seating
or other issues.
   ``What the blind want most is simple, straightforward,
uncomplicated and reasonable. We want to be left alone to buy our
tickets and fly in peace,'' Marc Mauer, president of the
federation, told a government panel last September.
   The new regulations are expected to provide broad guidelines to
the airlines on how they should accommodate the handicapped and
also provide specific requirements.
   ``Once we get these regulations in draft form a lot of people
will finally know what their rights are and the airlines will know
what their obligations are. Things will be a lot clearer,'' says
David Capozzi, an official of the Paralyzed Veterans of America.
   The regulations stem from the Air Carrier Access Act, enacted by
Congress in 1986 to specifically guarantee the rights of the
handicapped to have access to air travel without discrimination.
   Capozzi, who uses a wheelchair, said issues still to be resolved
include:
   _ The question of where handicapped passengers should be allowed
to sit. Federal regulations include no seating restrictions,
although many airlines have policies that direct handicapped to be
seated in certain sections of a plane.
   _ Should airlines be allowed to set a limit on the number of
handicapped people to allow on a single flight? Airlines want to
restrict such passengers to no more than the number of emergency
exits on an aircraft.
   _ Should a handicapped traveler be required to be accompanied by
an attendant? Advocacy groups for the handicapped argue that should
be up to the traveler involved.
   The seating issue is among the most controversial.
   The airlines want the government to specifically exclude
handicapped passengers from certain seats, such as the row next to
an emergency exit. But groups representing the handicapped scoff at
suggestions that a blind person might be a liability in such a
location. They also say that if there is a restriction it should be
limited to the door adjacent to the exit and not an entire row.
   Some airlines require the handicapped to be seated in specific
seats in an aircraft. Recently, a blind passenger aboard a Midway
Airlines jet was arrested when she refused to move from the smoking
section at the rear of the plane to the first row close to an exit
door.
   Capozzi said that the incident was an example of another problem
facing the handicapped.
   ``They (the airlines) treat the disabled persn as a homogenized
group. You need to look at the individual differences,'' he says.
Travelers who are confined to wheelchairs, for example, like the
first row of an airplane because of the easy access, but to a blind
person that same requirement may not be irrelevant, he suggests.

<TEXT>
   Shamu, Namu and Kandu are readying a
killer of a sea show that organizers hope will fishtail with the
Alamo and the city's River Walk.
   While the killer whales swim around in a 7 million gallon tank,
gardeners are putting the final landscaping touches on Sea World of
Texas, a $140 million, 250-acre facility billed as the nation's
largest marine theme park.
   The park's ``Big Splash'' opening is set for May 28, but
workers, animals and trainers are already performing in rehearsals
for visitors.
   Sea World, 13 miles northwest of downtown San Antonio, will be
open year-round. It is expected to employ 2,000 people during its
peak summer season, generate a $25 million annual payroll and
attract 3 million visitors bearing another $300 million yearly for
the park's and South Texas' economies.
   City and tourist industry officials have looked at Sea World as
a magnet for tourists to help the state diversify from its
dependency on petroleum, but Sea World chairman George Becker warns
against expecting too much too soon.
   ``I've cautioned a few people that we'll do the very best that
we can, but not to rest on their laurels and expect us to be the
end-all and the answer to all of their business problems,'' he said.
   Visitors can expect to see the park's star, Shamu, a two-ton
killer whale that was among the fish and animals brought in from
three other Sea World parks around the country.
   Shamu will perform in a 4,500-seat stadium. At other, smaller
stadiums, dolphins, seals, sea lions, walruses and other animals
will show their stuff, too.
   Skiers will perform acrobatics in a 12-acre lake, and visitors
can walk across the United States via a one-acre ``map'' of the
country.
   There are restaurants, lounges, a disco for teen-agers and a
playground for children. There also is Cypress Gardens West, a
botanical center where a variety of flowers will bloom year-round.
   San Antonio tourism already generates more than $1 billion
annually, with lures like the Alamo and the River Walk.
   Texas is home to Six Flags of Texas in Arlington and to
AstroWorld in Houston, both of which attract about 1.7 million
visitors a year each.
   Tourist industry officials believe Sea World will help, not
hurt, those amusement parks.
   ``It's actually going to help them because it completes the
triangle of from San Antonio, Houston and the Dallas-Fort Worth
area,'' said Larry Todd, director of the Texas Tourist Agency.
   He said Sea World is following the lead of other tourist
attractions by promoting Texas first and its location second.
   ``I don't think tourism is a panacea, but it's all fresh, new
money and it's an immediate boost to the economy and it's rapidly
becoming one of our top industries,'' Todd said.
   ``We Texans had better face the fact that tourism is an industry
whose time has come. We have sat back and been dependent on oil and
agriculture and haven't needed tourism, and now all of a sudden we
need it and we need to market Texas intelligently,'' he said.
   (Sea World's one-day admission is $18.95 for adults and $15.95
for senior citizens (55 and older) and children 3-11. A 12-month
pass is $49 for adults and $39 for children. Founders Club pass,
available until May 28, is $125 and offers special discounts and is
good for admission through Dec. 31, 1991. Sea World sales office
number is 512-523-3400.)

   As the well-known old European capital cities _ London, Paris,
Rome _ slowly regain travel favor with Americans, ``Andrew Harper's
Hideaway Report'' provides a list of ``enchanting'' small hotels he
describes as ``well-managed, personalized properties nestled in
uniquely private settings.''
   Harper is a pseudonym for the editor and publisher who travels
the world incognito for a monthly newsletter directed primarily at
top business executives with a median annual income of more than
$200,000.
   His choices as ``1987 Hideaways of the Year'' in Europe include
these country house hotels:
   _ Park Hotel Kenmare (Kenmare, Ireland)
   _ Chewton Glen (New Milton, England)
   _ Bodysgallen Hall (Llandudno, Wales)
   _ Arisaig House (Arisaig, Scotland)
   _ La Reserve de Beaulieu (Beaulieu-sur-Mer, France)
   _ Zurserhof (Zurs am Arlberg, Austria)
   _ Falsled Kro (Falsled, Denmark)
   _ Il Pellicano (Porto Ercole, Italy)
   _ Wald and Schlosshotel Friedrichsruhe (near Ohringen, West
Germany)
   _ Pousada da Rainha Santa Isabel (Estremaz, Portugal)
   Two ``urban sanctuaries'' listed by Harper as best small hotels
are The Plaza in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the Hotel de Orangerie in
Bruges, Belgium.
   His selections, he says, are based on service, charm, comfort,
decor, food and ``the intangible Q factor that separates the good
from the truly enchanting.''
   Harper, who promotes his newsletter as ``a connoisseur's guide
to peaceful and unspoiled places,'' limits his circulation to about
15,000 and carries no advertising. He says his subscribers are
willing to pay a premium ``to get away from other people in a very
crowded world.''
   In 1987, more than 6 million Americans visited Europe, about 18
percent more than the previous year, according to the European
Travel Commission. ETC said it was the second best year ever for
U.S. travel to Europe, topped only by the 6.4 million total of 1985.
   The 23 member countries of the commission forecast 1988 traffic
slightly ahead of last year, despite the decline of the dollar
overseas.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soho, the Bohemian neighborhood famed for its
smorgasbord of restaurants and expensive, tourist-oriented topless
bars, is cleaning up its naughty image.
   Families are moving back to the once seedy half-mile square area
of central London that was originally settled by immigrants and
refugees.
   Trendy restaurants, wine bars and media companies are moving
next door to generations-old firms of tailors, silversmiths and
clockmakers, reclaiming the classic Georgian buildings from what
was collectively known as ``the vice.''
   Part of Soho has become the capital's Chinatown, with Gerard
Street converted into a busy mall lined with Chinese restaurants,
supermarkets, bookstores and pay phones with pagoda-style roofs.
   The impetus for change came from Soho's residents who were tired
of gazing out their windows at pulsating pink neon signs boasting
``Girls, Girls, Girls,'' and of having to slink past peep shows,
pornographic cinemas, lingerie shops and topless bars every time
they took their children to school or shopped for groceries.
   ``The local community realized that it was them or us,''
explained Bryan Burrough, chairman of the Soho Society. ``And we
wanted to make sure it was us.''
   Soho became synonymous with sleaze during World War II when
American soldiers swarmed to its clubs and pubs. But Burrough said
Soho didn't hit rock bottom until the mid-1970s.
   ``Prior to the mid-1960s, `the vice' was represented in the main
by prostitutes who were fairly unnoticeable,'' he said.
   ``In the 1970s it became sex cinemas, topless encounter bars,
all sorts of things totally outside the provisions of the law. So
ordinary, legitimate businesses were being pushed out.''
   The 1,000-member Soho Society was founded in 1972 as a community
group, and one of first accomplishments was to have Soho declared a
conservation area, meaning nothing can be demolished without
permission from the Westminster borough council.
   Westminster then passed tougher laws to regulate the flesh
trade. The borough set aside just 10 licenses for sex shops, and a
spokeswoman says only five were actually issued, all to book and
video stores.
   Burrough said about 20 more sex shops still operate illegally,
compared with a decade ago when 185 Soho buildings were devoted to
the sex industry. He said 18 such buildings were on Greek Street
alone, but now its four short blocks are home to 18 restaurants,
three pubs, two sandwich bars, a patisserie, and only one sex shop.
   Soho, in the heart of London's West End theater district, is
bounded by Oxford Street, Regent Street, Charing Cross Road and
Leicester Square.
   The name is thought to come from the ancient hare-hunting cry,
``So-Ho.'' The area's cosmopolitan flavor dates back to its first
immigrants, French Protestants known as Huguenots who arrived in
the late 1600s. Germans and Italians, many of them cooks and
waiters, arrived in the 1860s and 1870s, followed by Polish and
Russian Jews, many of them tailors, in the 1890s.
   Joining the melting pot were families from almost every other
European country as well as British colonies past and present,
Indians and Hong Kong Chinese.
   In the 1960s a favorite Soho haunt was Carnaby Street, with its
swinging fashion shops stocked with bellbottoms, go-go boots,
miniskirts and fishnet stockings.
   Today, Soho's nooks and crannies are still packed with old
established family businesses. Here the Savile Row tailors have
their workshops, and gold lace is handmade for Buckingham Palace's
livery.
   Sprinkled among them are dozens of new film production and
distribution offices, film laboratories, advertising agencies and
other support services for London's TV and cinema industry.
   Street for street, Soho is said to have more restaurants than
any other part of London, ranging from Japanese sushi bars to a
1950s-style chrome and formica diner.
   Gourmets and gourmands can wallow in a cheese shop offering 200
varieties including car-tire-sized wheels of Swiss emmenthal. A
coffee shop sells 25 types of fresh, aromatic beans, and barbecued
ducks hang in Chinese markets.

   Take the train: That's the message of railroads
all over Europe, North America and Japan.
   Their lures include rail passes and reduced rates, tours
sponsored by the railroads or by companies using rail
transportation, and ride-a-bit, drive-a-bit arrangements covering
trains and cars.
   Railroads have taken into account that a person may not want to
ride the rails continuously, day after day, and yet wants full
money's worth from his pass. So some offer passes that are good for
perhaps nine days of train travel within a 21-day period or 16 days
within a month, or other combinations. Eurail's Flexipass and the
French Railpass fall into this category.
   The Flexipass is one of Eurail's four types of passes, all first
class and covering 16 countries from Austria and Greece to Portugal
and Ireland, but not Britain. For that, one would want the first
class or economy class BritRail pass.
   Eurail, BritRail and the France Railpass all must be purchased
outside the countries concerned.
   Travelers seeking to concentrate on a given region might look
into the Scandinavian Rail Pass, covering Denmark, Finland, Norway
and Sweden and sold in the Scandinavian countries, or the Benelux
Tourrail Pass, covering Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg and
sold only in those countries.
   The European Travel Commission also lists more than a dozen
countries that have their own passes. They include Italy (B.T.L.C.
Pass), Ireland (Rambler), Austria (Austrian Network Pass), and
Switzerland (Swiss Holiday Card).
   A number of countries also offer discounts of up to 50 percent
for senior citizens or sell half-fare cards entitling a traveler to
half-fare on all train travel for a given period.
   On this side of the Atlantic, Amtrak has its All Aboard America
fares, enabling people to take the train to any destination within
one region of the country for a set roundtrip price, within two
regions for a bit more and across the entire country for still
another set price. One intermediate stop is allowed each way.
Amtrak also offers a $7 Return Fare under which the purchaser of a
one-way ticket in many cases can get the return trip for only $7.
On regular Amtrak fares, seniors get a discount.
   Canada's railroad system, Via, has a Canrailpass and a
Youthrailpass, which can be purchased in Canada, and senior
citizens get one-third off regular fares.
   In Japan, there are first-class and ordinary rail passes _ and a
new undersea tunnel, more than 33 miles, linking the main island of
Honshu with Hokkaido to the north.
   In many countries, passes also carry such perks as cut-rate
entry to places of interest or free travel on city buses or subways.
   This is just a glimpse along the tracks. Railroads urge
travelers to consider all the options before they make a choice.
Sometimes a senior discount, for instance, or a one-time payment
for half-fare privileges might be a bigger bargain than a pass.
   Many Americans, unused to trains, may feel lost without a car.
The railroads have the answer: a car waiting at the station.
Explore the countryside, return the car, and board the train again
for the next destination _ and the next car. Eurail users can even
leave the car involved in another country in some cases.
   For travelers who don't want to lift a finger, there are tours
by rail: Mexico's famed Copper Canyon with its 37 bridges and 86
tunnels; Canada coast-to-coast; a nostalgic trip on the Orient
Express from Istanbul to Zurich, Switzerland. You name it. The less
ambitious can take one-day excursions _ from Paris to the chateau
country, or London to Bath, Stonehenge and Salisbury, for instance.
   Tours take care of luggage, hotels, many meals, sightseeing and
escorts to tell one what it's all about and leap the language
barrier.

   What's in a name? Plenty, if it happens to be
Spa, Belgium. For that town in the eastern Ardennes with its
healing waters has given its name worldwide to the spots where
people go to feel better, shape up physically, unknot their
tensions, shed excess pounds and be pampered with manicures,
pedicures, facials, hair-styling and the like.
   Spa, Belgium, was mentioned by the Roman Pliny the Elder in the
first century A.D., it is believed. In the Middle Ages, its healing
waters began to be exploited. Beginning in about the 16th century,
royalty including Margaret of Navarre, Queen Christina of Sweden,
Peter the Great of Russia and Austrian Emperor Joseph II frequented
the resort.
   It is still there, catering not only to those who seek a
``cure,'' but to those who just want a pleasant vacation, with
golf, riding, fishing, tennis, a casino, concerts, a nearby
racetrack and parachute jumping exhibits at a nearby airfield.
   From Alaska to Brazil and Australia and Japan to Greece and
Hungary, people are going to spas _ all kinds of spas.
   Spa-Finders, which puts out a spa catalogue and also uses a
computer to help match people with the right spa for them, lists
eight major categories. They include classic fitness spas that
combine exercise, diet and relaxation in fairly equal proportions;
spas that specialize in behavior modification; those that feature
mineral springs, and holistic spas. The holistic spas are often
vegetarian and offer such Eastern practices as yoga and Siatsu
massage.
   Spas have a vocabulary of their own _ including Siatsu, which is
a Japanese method of massage that follows the patterns used in
acupuncture. A person can become involved with a Scotch hose, Swiss
shower, salt glo, polarity, reflexology, thalassotherapy _ or sit
it out in a Roman bath, a heated sea-water jacuzzi with benches.
   The average person pedaling an exercise bike and swimming laps
at the ``Y'' may think spas are not for her or him. Too expensive.
Not so, say the spa people, who say you can find some costing only
a few hundred dollars a week per person.
   Ryan Vollmer, in ``Affordable Spas & Fitness Resorts,'' says
nearly 90 percent of spas now operating in the United States cost
less than $1,000 a week, and some are priced in the $400 to $500
range.
   Some are advertised for even less: Spend a week at a New
Hampshire retreat that emphasizes stress-reduction by massage,
yoga, meditation, long walks in the woods, sunbathing and swimming,
for instance. Or you can get spruced up at a resort hotel and spa
in the Arkansas Hot Springs National Park-Ouachita Mountain area.
In California, one is invited to bathe in hot springs at
temperatures of 98 to 120 degrees at a kerosene-lit hotel on ground
that was considered sacred for healing by the Indians. Bring your
own food and cook it on a country stove. All these places are under
$400.
   At the other end of the price list are such establishments as
California's Golden Door, whose fans insist it's worth every bit of
the more than $3,000 one will spend for a week's hospitality.
   Jeffrey Joseph of Spa-Finders has found that the spa market is a
United States one. If Americans go abroad, he says, it's usually to
well-known resorts such as Montecatini in Italy, Baden-Baden, West
Germany, or Baden, Switzerland.
   But there are bargains waiting all over Europe and other
countries - including Australia, Margaret Island in the Danube at
Budapest, the Greek island of Kos, Yugoslavia and Austria _ and
Spa, Belgium.

   For some vacationers, cruising down the river means viewing
castles on the Rhine, Egyptian monuments along the Nile or jungle
foliage on the banks of the Amazon.
   But Americans with a sense of history who prefer traveling
closer to home will find several offbeat programs offered this
season by tour operators emphasizing the nation's heritage.
   They include a package tour for vacationers lured by the call of
the wild to Jack London country, a sail down the St. Lawrence River
where American patriots skirmished with British redcoats, and the
exploration of rivers once crowded with Union and Confederate
gunboats.
   ``To the pioneers, the rivers were the interstate highways of
America,'' says Jack Biesterfeld, president of Great American River
Cruises, an Illinois-based company that specializes in travel
programs focusing on North American history and heritage.
   According to Biesterfeld, the cruises will be using a variety of
boats and ships ranging from historic paddlewheel steamboats to
sleek river cruisers, and will be combined with land tours ``that
enable the traveler to delve even deeper into the history of
America.''
   Offerings this year include a two-week excursion through Jack
London territory that follows the footsteps of the early gold
miners and sourdoughs of Alaska and the Yukon, with stops at
Dawson, Whitehorse and Skagway.
   Another program is a 10-day ``Cruise to the Mountains''
combining a trip on the Mississippi Queen steamboat from St. Louis
along the Ohio, Tennessee and Mississippi rivers with a tour of the
Great Smoky Mountains.
   There also is an eight-day program tracing the trail of the
California gold rush ``49ers'' on the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rivers, with a motorcoach tour of the rugged California coast from
San Francisco through the Big Sur to Los Angeles, ending with a
two-day stay aboard the Queen Mary.
   ``Hudson Heritage'' is a nine-day tour highlighting the maritime
history of the East Coast, including cruises on Long Island Sound,
and on the Hudson and Connecticut rivers, plus visits to Sleepy
Hollow and West Point.
   Farther afield, another tour operator, New York-based Special
Expeditions, Inc., has scheduled an offbeat 27-day August voyage
called ``Impressions of an Arctic Summer.''
   The voyage aboard the 80-passenger ship ``M.S. Polaris'' begins
in Iceland and ends in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Points in between
include Greenland, Baffin Island, Hudson Bay, Labrador and
Newfoundland.
   Plans call for visits to Eric the Red's Viking settlement at
Narsarsuaq, which dates back to 982 A.D., and several Eskimo
villages. Polar bears inhabit the pack ice, and seabird colonies
abound.
   Other unusual programs beckoning travelers to faraway places
this summer include one-week cruises aboard a 16-passenger wooden
schooner modeled after a Greek pirate ship.
   The schooner ``Andromeda'' departs from Piraeus, the port for
Athens, every Saturday with a crew of five to visit 15 Greek
islands.
   The itinerary includes a call at the port of Gerakas, once a
departure point for infamous pirate ships; the island of Hydra,
where cars are prohibited and donkeys provide the primary means of
transportation, and a picturesque cove on Spetsopoula, an island
privately owned by Greek shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos.
   ``Sailing around the Greek isles on a pirate ship may sound like
an unaffordable luxury, but in truth it doesn't have to be,''says
Fred Schwartz, executive director of Vacation Network, a
Chicago-based tour operator.
   ``In addition to being one of the world's most beautiful
destinations, Greece happens to be among today's best vacation
values.''
   But the biggest news _ literally _ in the maritime travel
business this year is the launching of what is billed as the
largest cruise ship ever built, ``Sovereign of the Seas,'' a
74,000-ton, $185 million vessel which can accommodate more than
2,200 passengers.
   The ship has 12 passenger decks and is measures 874 feet from
stem to stern, nearly the length of three football fields placed
end-to-end.
   For those who simply love the idea of a cruise _ without
necessarily going anywhere _ there's the Chakiris Fantasy Cruise, a
weekend trip to virtually nowhere. It leaves New York on a Friday
night and goes down the Hudson River outside the harbor into the
Atlantic Ocean until it returns Sunday afternoon.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ripoffs and muggings of foreign
tourists are giving Rio an image problem, and the government _
discreetly _ is trying to persuaded ``gringos'' to skip this famous
city and visit other parts of vast Brazil.
   ``There's only one trouble spot for tourists in Brazil, and
that's Rio de Janeiro,'' Joao Doria Jr., president of Embratur, the
federal government tourist board, told The AP.
   Police figures are imprecise, but almost every day Rio
newspapers carry stories of Americans, Europeans and even Latins
from the Spanish-speaking part of South America complaining of
1,000 percent jackups of taxi fares, thefts of cameras and wallets
from beaches and hotel rooms, and even outright stickups, sometimes
by armed robbers.
   A federal government poster at Rio's international airport shows
a doll-like figure wearing shorts and a flowery shirt, with a
camera around its neck. Written below in big letters is: ``Respeite
o Turista,'' or ``Respect the Tourist'' in Portuguese, Brazil's
language.
   Embratur's official line is that Rio is still a great place. But
meanwhile, the agency is trying to make it easier for foreigners to
visit other parts of the country.
   Many foreigners don't realize that Brazil is bigger in area than
the 48 contiguous United States, and tropical beach cities such as
Recife and Natal at the country's northeastern tip and the Amazon
jungle gateway of Manaus are thousands of miles closer to the
Northern Hemisphere than Rio is.
   Brazil's Varig Airlines has a daily nonstop run from Miami to
Rio. But one extra flight on that route stops weekly in Manaus,
where Embratur has begun a program of ``ecological tourism'' aimed
at the appreciation for and preservation of the remarkable flora
and fauna along the tributaries of the Amazon River.
   Varig, Air France and Air Portugal now include Recife, with its
miles of palm-fringed, balmy beaches and precious Portuguese
colonial architecture, on some of their European flights.
   ``We want to increase airline competition to Brazilian entry
points that are not now generally well known,'' Doria said. ``The
goal is to reduce air fares and attract more visitors.''
   Despite its climate, scenery, music and cheap currency, Brazil
attracts just 1 percent of world tourism. And of the 2 million
annual visitors, most come from neighboring Argentina and Uruguay,
with the United States in third place, followed by Italy and West
Germany.
   ``Because Brazil is a poor country, surrounded by poor
countries, in the far-off Southern Hemisphere, it will never
compete with places such as Mexico, Spain and Italy for
international tourism,'' Doria said. ``But we do think
realistically we can get our share up to 3 percent.''
   But Brazil's own typical Latin bureaucracy often gets in the way
of tourism objectives.
   The Air Force Ministry, which determines international airline
routes, has been reluctant to promote unrestricted air competition.
``The ministry has been, let us say, conservative in this area, but
still we are making progress,'' Doria said. ``Five years ago, no
charter flights were permitted in Brazil. Today we have them every
week from North America and Europe.''
   Brazil's Foreign Relations Ministry often makes foreign tourists
obtain a visa before they can come to brazil. The standard is
reciprocity: If a foreign country requires a visa for Brazilians,
then citizens of that country must get a visa for Brazil.
   ``Sometimes what sounds right diplomatically doesn't make sense
economically,'' Doria said of the visa policy. ``Take the case of
Canada, which recently instituted visas for Brazil, because some
Brazilian tourists were caught working there illegally. So now
Canadians need visas to visit Brazil. But I can't imagine many
Canadians seeking to work illegally in Brazil.''
   ``Our own government's countermeasures was not in our country's
best interests, financially speaking,'' Doria said.

   The Third Annual Curacao Open International Pro-Am Windsurf
Championship is set to take place in Caribbean waters off the
Holiday Beach Hotel and Casino June 14-19. More than 100
windsurfers are expected to compete for the $35,000 pro prize.
   Curacao, the largest of five islands of the Netherlands
Antilles, is about 40 miles north of Venezuela.
   The 38-mile-long island is generally warm (average 80 degrees),
dry and windy, with June the windiest month (average 18 mph). Most
of the population cluster around the capital of Willemstad near the
east end of the island, while the western half remains relatively
untouched by civilization.
   Visitors return with reports of numerous bays, white-sand
beaches, and calm, crystal clear waters. Highest point on the
island is St. Christoffelsberg, at 1,220 feet.
   A popular site is the Queen Emma pontoon bridge, one of the
oldest pontoon bridges in the Western Hemisphere, which celebrates
its 100th anniversary this year. Spanning St. Anna Bay, the Queen
Emma swings open every time a cruise ship calls to dock at the
terminal in Willemstad or a tanker or cargo vessel sails into the
inner harbor's deepwater port.
   U.S. citizens don't need a passport, but proof of citizenship
and a return ticket.

   A new portable computer, appropriately called Voice, can
translate spoken English into one of four European languages.
   The computer, developed by Advanced Products and Technologies
Inc., of Redmond, Wash., is voice-activated (there's no keyboard)
and weighs less than 4 pounds. Depending on the cartridge being
used, Voice converts some 2,000 English phrases into French,
German, Spanish or Italian for display on the screen.
   The $1,500 device does not translate back into English. However,
says Steve Rondel, the manufacturer's president, it does allow
rudimentary communication without previous language study or the
``inconvenience'' of phrase books.
   To operate the system, a traveler inserts two cartridges, one
programmed to recognize the voice pattern of the user and the other
supplying the translation.
   Among other ``high-tech'' travel products is a calculator called
``Travel Helper,'' from Sharp Electronics, that converts currency,
tells time in two time zones and includes an alarm clock.

   Walt Disney World will open a
``Mickey Mouse Birthday Land'' this summer to mark the 60th
anniversary of the popular cartoon creation.
   Birthday Land features a 60-foot-high inflatable balloon in the
shape of Mickey Mouse. Visitors can walk into Mickey and Minnie's
house, which includes a ``Memory Room'' with films and souvenirs of
Mickey's career beginning in 1928 with ``Steamboat Willie,'' the
first Mickey Mouse cartoon to be released.
   The anniversary date is actually Nov. 18, but the Disney World
celebration begins in June.
   The Grand Floridian beach resort and a Nordic village at the
Epcot Center are also set to open in Disney World this summer.
   The Grand Floridian is a 900-room hotel near the Magic Kingdom,
Disney's original theme park. It has six structures of white
siding, gabled balconies and red-topped turrets and is located on
the shore of the Seven Seas Lagoon at the park.
   ``Norway, Gateway to Scandinavia,'' is the 11th national display
in Epcot's World Showcase.
   Also new this year is the Disney-MGM Studios Preview Center,
which offers a preview of the studio tour planned to open in the
spring of 1989.

   ``Wednesday 3 June 1863.
   ``Cloudy weather dominated the skies along the Rappahannock
River at Fredericksburg, Va. It rained somewhat in the morning.''
   It was on that day that the Gettysburg campaign of the Civil War
began with the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia starting its
march toward Pennsylvania, as Gen. Robert E. Lee ``commenced to
draw the army from the vicinity of Fredericksburg.'' Lee realized
some of his army's deficiencies, yet wrote to his wife: ``I trust
that a kind Providence will watch over us, and notwithstanding our
weakness and sins will yet give us a name and place among the
nations of the earth.''
   The excerpts are from a National Park Service daybook of the
campaign, part of the national commemoration of the 125th
anniversary of the key battle at the Gettysburg, Pa., National
Military Park.
   The commemoration begins Memorial Day, May 30. A ``Living
History Encampment'' starts June 18 on a farm outside Gettysburg,
when more than 1,000 re-enactors will organize an encampment and
simulate the battle, firing blanks from original and
authentic-looking Civil War guns and cannons.
   It will culminate in three days in July with a re-creation of
the conflict that became the ``high water mark of the
Confederacy.'' On July 1, 1863, the Confederate Army of Northern
Virgina pushed the Union Army of the Potomac from its positions
north and west of the town to its final defense line, to sites like
Little Round Top, Cemetery Hill, Devil's Den, Culp's Hill,
Spangler's Spring.
   Col. George Pickett's charge, a frontal assault on July 3, sent
12,000 Confederate soldiers toward the Union line. Less than 4,000
returned. On July 4, Lee's army withdrew, never to return to the
North.
   Some 160,000 soldiers took part in that battle 125 years ago;
there were some 50,000 casualties.
   A few months later, a national cemetery was dedicated at the
Gettysburg battlefield. President Lincoln gave a brief speech.
   On Nov. 19 this year, the now-famous Gettysburg Address will be
re-enacted with an actor portraying Lincoln leading the procession
from the original railroad station to the National Cemetery. U.S.
Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist is scheduled to
re-read the address.

   Hotels are going up so
fast at Playa Dorada resort that golf vistas include half-built
buildings as well as palm trees, and sunbathers have to walk past
construction workers and cement mixers to get to the beach.
   Fresh water and electricity are in short supply, and the
romantic candles guests find in their rooms really are there to
tide them through blackouts.
   But never mind. Tourists drawn by white sand beaches, warm
winter breezes and bargain prices are flocking to this
Spanish-speaking nation and making it the most popular Caribbean
destination after Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.
   Tourism Minister Fernando Rainieri says, ``I hope to make the
Dominican Republic the tourism Mecca of the Caribbean before 1990.''
   Just a few years ago, such an expectation would have seemed
hopelessly optimistic. In 1979, there were only 3,400 hotel rooms
in the whole country, direct flights were few and marketing efforts
haphazard.
   Today, resorts like Puerta Plata and La Romana are as well known
as Cancun, Mexico, and Montego Bay, Jamaica.
   Visitor arrivals jumped 21 percent to 791,380 last year, and are
up 60 percent this decade. Hotel capacity has soared to 12,000
rooms and is expected to reach 23,000 in time for the 1991 winter
season.
   The boom is the result of increased promotional efforts, a
favorable exchange rate _ the U.S. dollar that bought 1 peso four
years ago now buys more than 5 _ and generous financial incentives
for investors.
   Airlines increased seats by 50 percent in 1987, Rainieri said,
and plan to do the same this year.
   The industry is the brightest spot in an economy where one of
every two workers is jobless or only marginally employed, and one
in four lives below the poverty line.
   Tourism has created 40,000 direct and 100,000 indirect jobs,
many paying several times the minimum wage of $70 a month.
   Most new construction is taking place on the north coast, a
sun-drenched strip of beaches wedged between a mountain ridge and
the Atlantic Ocean that seems a world removed from the crowded,
impoverished capital Santo Domingo, located on the Caribbean coast
four hours away by car.
   The Playa Dorada resort, built on a sugar cane field, has eight
hotels with 150 to 400 rooms each. Four more are under construction
and another four are in the planning stage.
   The town of Sosua 10 miles to the east was a sleepy dairy
community five years ago. Now, 30 hotels are under construction,
dairy farms are being sold to developers and land prices have
skyrocketed.
   A similar boom in tourism and construction is taking place in
the rest of the Caribbean, where the number of visitors topped 9
million for the first time last year _ up 12 percent from 1986.
   Jamaica, Puerto Rico and other places have undertaken major
construction programs, and estimates on the number of rooms being
built right now range up to 20,000.
   That concerns some tourism officials, who wonder where the
tourists will come from to fill all the rooms. After two record
years in a row, the number of visitors to the region this year is
likely to stabilize at 1987 levels.

   Planning on a little roadwork this summer?
   If you're talking the kind of roadwork done the more comfortable
way _ in a car _ you might check out some of the new road maps:
   The 1988 version of the Rand McNally ``Road Atlas and Vacation
Guide'' ($13.95) claims 17,000 revisions since last year, with 345
updated road, city and national park maps. The oversized book is
not only a national diagram of arteries in the travel vein, but
includes vacation information about destinations from the Grand
Canyon to Natchitoches, La., the starting point of the historic
Spanish Trail. And it has traveler's discount coupons.
   A companion book aimed at business travelers is the spiral-bound
``Business Traveler's Road Atlas'' ($12.95).
   In about one-third of the 1988 editions of the Road Atlas, there
is a removable ``Vacation Travel Guide'' supplement with telephone
listings for National Parks and more detailed information on theme
parks, resorts, golf courses, toll roads and state fishing and
hunting license fees.
   (This edition is $6.95.)
   A ``Deluxe Road Atlas and Travel Guide'' from Rand McNally
($5.95) is a smaller, spiral-bound edition that opens flat. It
includes vacation ideas and destinations, maps of the states, and
detailed city and metropolitan area maps with airport information.
   The American Automobile Association's 1988 edition of its road
atlas lists 58,400 cities and towns, with separate recreational,
city and national park maps. and driving tips ($5.95).
   American Map Corp. has a spiral-bound, smaller-sized
(8{-by-11-inch) ``United States Highway Atlas,'' including Canada
and Mexico ($5.95). It features separate pages on 37
``most-visited'' metropolitan areas and a double-page map showing
national parks and monuments.

   American business will spend more than $100 billion on travel
and entertainment by 1990, according to an American Express survey
of business travel management.
   By comparison, an estimated $85 billion was spent in 1986, which
American Express says is one-third more than business paid in
taxes. The travel expense figure was $2 billion in 1985.
   Nearly 2,500 companies were surveyed and 28 percent responded,
says American Express.
   According to the survey, air travel accounted for the largest
portion of the travel and entertainment expenses, 41 percent of
every travel dollar. Lodging (22 percent) and meals (17 percent)
were next highest, followed by entertainment (14 percent) and car
(6 percent).
   In the future, competition for business customers will focus on
quality of service, according to American Express Travel Management
Services.
   ``The competition for business customers is going to be won on
quality of service, not price, as travel vendors respond to a high
level of consumer discontent and focus on service issues,'' said
Tomasso Zanzotto, president of Travel Management Services, in a
1988 business travel forecast.
   Brian Froehlich, of American Express Travel Management Services,
says, ``There's a definite interest in delivering high quality
service to companies and their travelers. We understand that
quality is directly related to our success.''
   A recent booklet from the American Society of Travel Agents, a
trade association, reminded customers to plan ahead and ask
questions of their travel agents: What is included in the price?
What restrictions apply on discounted fare travel? What about
passports and foreign currency?
   Travelmasters, a Chicago-based agency, is among those who have
created information services to help customers make decisions.
   The agency has a Travel Line for special and last minute details
for leisure travel customers and Fare Update, a monthly newsletter
for corporate travelers and a Travelmaster Market Pack, containing
travel costs, tour information, maps and weather information.
   ``As our business has become more computerized,'' says agency
executive Peggy Blitz, ``it's more important than ever that we give
meaningful service to each other.''
   In another report, Runzheimer International said business travel
prices rose sharply during 1987, increasing by 16.5 percent over
the previous year. Runzheimer is a consulting firm based in
Rochester, Wis.
   ``The reason for the big increase is due mostly to rising costs
in air travel,'' said Brad Burris, executive vice president. ``The
airlines tightened restrictions for travelers in 1987, making
discount fares less available than in the past. Therefore, business
travelers had difficulty fitting their schedules around the
available low fare flights.
   Air fares rose 30.5 percent during the year, according to
Runzheimer.

   The number of people visiting Hawaii grew in
1987 for the sixth straight year, thanks partly to a boost by 1.16
million Japanese visitors, the Hawaii Visitors Bureau says.

   A language expert says it's all right to
call San Francisco ``Frisco,'' even though the city's Convention
and Visitors Bureau guidebook is titled ``Don't Call it Frisco.''
   San Francisco's nickname has been all but eradicated in its home
town, mainly because of language snobbery in the early years of
this century, Columbia University lexicographer Allen Walker Read
told a joint session of the Modern Language Association and
American Dialect Society.
   Read said sailors and miners called the port Frisco at least as
early as 1849. Not until 1882 was there any mention in print of
what he termed ``this feverish campaign against `Frisco.'''
   ```Frisco' has its place on the colloquial, informal level,'' he
sayd, ``and the problem would take care of itself if left alone.''

   President Reagan charged Congress with caving
in to organized labor with its trade bill but supporters of the
measure said it was his ``wishful thinking'' that a veto would win
him a version he prefers.
   The president has promised to veto the bill because of a
provision requiring all but the smallest employers to give 60 days
notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs.
   As the Senate began debate on the sweeping trade measure Friday,
Reagan told a group of state legislators the plant-closings
provision ``would make American industry less competitive.''

   The Commerce Department said Friday orders for durable goods,
items expected to last three or more years, were virtually
unchanged, rising less than 0.1 percent to $114.3 billion in March
as a drop in military hardware more than offset gains elsewhere.

   A proposal by two of the nation's biggest cable
television concerns to pay about $1.55 billion for the cable
systems of the former Storer Communications follows a bigger
consortium's abortive proposal to buy the properties at a higher
price.
   Comcast Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc. announced Sunday they
had a definitive agreement to acquire SCI Holdings, the company
formed when Storer was taken private by the investment firm
Kohlberg, Kravis & Roberts in a $2.5 billion leveraged buyout in
1985.
   SCI last year sold its six television stations for about $1.4
billion, leaving it with cable television systems serving about
1.48 million subscribers in 12 states in the East and South.
   The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other
conditions.
   Comcast and Tele-Communications both members of the consortium
that proposed and later dropped a plan to acquire SCI for about
$2.9 billion earlier this year.
   SCI said in December it had gotten a letter of intent for the
acquisition by the consortium, which included Comcast, American
Television and Communications Corp., which is owned by Time Inc.,
and Taft Cable Partners, a partnership of Tele-Communications and
Texas investor Robert M. Bass.
   That proposal was for an acquisition of SCI's 212 million common
shares at between $9.25 and $9.75 apiece, plus the acquisition of
preferred stock and $2.4 billion in debt.
   But the deal fell through in February when the consortium
attempted to cut the purchase price. John Malone, president of
Tele-Communications, contended that SCI had made inaccurate
representations that were disclosed during the course of the deal,
prompting the group to seek a price reduction.
   Comcast and Tele-Communications did not provide details of the
proposed acquisition in a news release, and telephone calls Sunday
to spokespeople at Comcast headquarters in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. and
Tele-Communications headquarters in Denver were unanswered. SCI
offices in Miami were closed Sunday.
   SCI did state that it estimated the purchase price would mean a
payment of between $4 and $4.50 for each outstanding warrant of SCI.
   Comcast operates cable systems serving about 1.35 million
subscribers plus Muzak franchises. The company also owns American
Cellular Network Corp., which operates cellular telephone systems
in New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland.
   Comcast posted a net loss of $9.4 million in its 1987 fiscal
year, compared with a 1986 profit of $1 million, or 3 cents a
share, due to the costs of financing several acquisitions and to
accounting factors. Revenue rose to $309.2 million from $130.8
million.
   Tele-Communications owns or controls cable systems serving about
six million subscribers, according to industry estimates. It also
owns a 52 percent stake in the operations of the newly merged
United Artists Entertainment Co., which has interests in cable
television and movie theaters.
   Tele-Communications posted a profit of $5.6 million, or 4 cents
a share, in its 1987 fiscal year, down from $72.3 million, or 48
cents a share, the previous year. Its revenue rose to $1.7 billion
from $645.7 million.
   The company blamed the earnings decline on the costs of
financing its acquisition of Heritage Communications Inc. and costs
related to its investment in United Artists Entertainment. The
profit figures included one-time gains of $42.4 million in 1987 and
$165 million in 1986 from asset sales, and a charge of $22.5
million in 1986 from settlement of litigation.

   H. Ross Perot, the Texas
entrepreneur-turned-philanthropist, addresses the annual luncheon
of The Associated Press today, as newspaper executives gather to
choose directors for the news cooperative.
   The AP annual meeting and luncheon are opening-day events at the
102nd annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers
Association.
   Perot developed his Electronic Data Systems Inc. from a $1,000
individual investment three decades ago into a computer-services
giant that he sold to General Motors in 1985 for $2.5 billion. He
has donated millions of dollars to schools, hospitals and other
institutions, and has been outspoken in promoting educational and
other social reforms.
   At their annual meeting, AP members also will hear a report on
world trouble spots from AP correspondents based in Nicaragua, the
Soviet Union, South Korea, Israel, and at the White House. Louis D.
Boccardi, president of the AP, will moderate the panel.
   In a letter to the membership, William J. Keating, chairman of
the board of the AP and president of the Detroit Newspaper Agency,
recalled the founding of the news cooperative.
   ``On a day in May 140 years ago, The Associated Press was
created by a group of newspaper publishers to deliver the best news
report possible for their collective needs, at an affordable
cost,'' Keating said. ``Today in this new world of news, the AP
continues to do just that.''
   In his annual report to the record-high 1,428 newspaper members
of the AP, Boccardi said the growth of the news cooperative carries
a clear message:
   ``We are summoned to an ever-growing responsibility to the news
industry, to service, speed, responsiveness, aggressiveness,
accuracy _ and above all else, to truth and fairness. ...
   ``We do not take this increased responsibility lightly, but we
face it confidently,'' Boccardi said. ``Our record has earned your
trust _ but we know that in the world of news, trust must be earned
anew, day by day, story by story.''
   AP members also will elect five members of the cooperative's
board of directors. Directors Robert G. Marbut of the Corpus
Christi (Texas) Caller-Times and John F. McGee of the Charleston
(W. Va.) Daily Mail are retiring after serving the maximum of three
consecutive three-year terms on the AP board.
   Board nominees are William M. Boyd of the Central New Jersey
Home News of New Brunswick; James E. Burgess of Madison's Wisconsin
State Journal; Katherine W. Fanning of the Christian Science
Monitor; Robert C. Maynard of The (Oakland, Calif.) Tribune; Ted M.
Natt of the Longview (Wash.) Daily News; Donald E. Newhouse of the
Newark (N.J.) Star-Ledger; Paul J. O'Brien of The Salt Lake Tribune
of Utah; James H. Ottaway Jr. of the Middletown (N.Y.) Times
Herald-Record; Stanley H. Stauffer of the Topeka (Kan.)
Capital-Journal, and F. Al Totter of the West Covina (Calif.) San
Gabriel Valley Times.
   Burgess, Maynard and Ottaway are incumbents seeking new terms.
   In addition, Edwin L. Heminger of the Findlay (Ohio) Courier and
John Grey Montgomery of the Junction City (Kan.) Daily Union, were
nominated to a board seat to represent a city of less than 50,000
population.
   Heminger is an incumbent board member. AP bylaws require that at
least three directors must be representatives of newspapers
published in small cities.

   Few high-technology products are as unwanted
as used computers, and thousands are junked each year in the United
States. But now more than $1 million worth of these high-tech
hand-me-downs are headed from America to the Third World.
   Since setting up formally in March, the Global Technology
Foundation has received pledges of computer donations worth that
much, and drawn requests for equipment from as far as Bangladesh
and Zimbabwe, said one of the founders, Philip Friedman.
   With the accelerated pace of innovations in research and
technology, a computer generation can last as little as two or
three years in the United States. After that, obsolescence sets in.
   Thousands of outdated computers are stacked in warehouses
gathering dust. Thousands more are crushed or melted down. Still
others are cannibalized for spare parts.
   Upset with the waste, Friedman and two friends in Boulder,
Colo., decided to set up a clearinghouse for diverting the U.S.
computer glut to developing countries in the Third World.
   Computer experts, American businessmen and Third World
specialists laud the idea.
   ``For users in the Third World, this could leapfrog them into
the 80s,'' said Robert Curley, chairman of PC Distributing Inc.
   ``I have never been able to bring myself to throw out perfectly
good equipment. This concept is very exciting to us,'' said Curley,
whose Illinois-based company is one of the largest computer
distributors in the Midwest.
   He estimated that his company's donations could amount to about
$100,000 annually in used computer hardware.
   For computer businesses, the donations are financially
beneficial: they are a tax deduction and can save thousands of
dollars in storage costs, said Friedman.
   Global Technology is asking donors to include manuals with the
computers and hopes to put together training packages including
literature and experts for the Third World users.
   ``We're not just going to dump the stuff and leave them to
figure it out,'' said Friedman.
   Global Technology has received the tax-exempt status of a
charitable foundation and has applied to several foundations for
grants to fund transportation for the donations and management of
its projects, he said.
   Gary Gaile, a geographer who serves on the foundation's advisory
board, has worked on a separate project to introduce computers to
government service in Kenya. Gaile, who teaches at the University
of Colorado in Boulder, said Kenyans were ``thrilled with the
computers. It gave them a rare skill in that society.''
   He said the Kenyan government used to compile its budget
manually, and was almost through the budget year before the
document was completed. With computers, the budget is on time,
Gaile said.
   ``Here, it's difficult to dump old computers. There, where
they're 10 or 15 years behind, these machines are more than
adequate,'' he said.
   The YMCA is one of the first in line to receive Global
Technology's free computers. Michael Diamond, assistant director of
the organization's International Division, said most of the YMCAs
in 92 countries run themselves without computers.
   ``This would give them a tremendous chance to improve their
management,'' he said.
   Computers would also be useful for the YMCAs' vocational
training and remedial programs in African and South American
countries, he said.
   Computer corporations do contribute some surplus equipment
overseas. But most of the computers go to specific government or
university projects, but the emphasis is on supplying training
experts rather than equipment.
   IBM, for example, is contributing to 200 projects overseas for
disaster preparedness planning, soil reclamation, public health and
other programs, said a company public affairs official, Linda
Nardin. But most of IBM's contributionconsists of supplying
professional advice, she added.
   Global Technology is also collecting medical and dental
equipment, agricultural machinery, construction machinery,
telephone equipment, water testing and purification devices. Even
sewing machines are welcome.

<TEXT>
   Textile giant J.P. Stevens & Co., target of a
protracted takeover battle, has accepted a $1.2 billion cash offer
from two buyers after initially rejecting the deal, the companies
involved said today.
   The $68.50-a-share deal will split up the 175-year-old fabric
maker, one of the nation's largest textile producers and an
important employer in the southeastern United States.
   The major buyer is rival textile producer West Point Pepperell
Inc., which will keep most of Stevens' sheet and towel operations
but sell some to another textile producer, Bibb Co. of Macon, Ga.,
to satisfy previously announced federal antitrust concerns.
   Odyssey Partners, a Wall Street investment firm that had been
vying with Pepperell to buy Stevens, will get the company's other
operations, including its carpet and industrial fabrics plants, for
about $530 million.
   Pepperell and Odyssey arranged the purchase with Stevens after
an initial $1.2 billion offer was rejected, partly because of the
target company's concerns about the tentative nature of Odyssey's
financing.
   The terms were revised over the weekend to Stevens'
satisfaction, and the deal was accepted.
   In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Stevens rose 25
cents to $67.75 a share.
   Pepperell has made its bids in conjunction with the NTC Group,
parent of Bibb. Under terms of the agreement with Stevens, the
Pepperell group will acquire the entire company for $68.50 a share
under a tender offer that will expire at midnight EDT May 6, unless
extended.
   Odyssey will then purchase its portion of the the Stevens assets
from Pepperell. But if Pepperell cannot complete its end of the
deal, Odyssey has agreed to purchase Stevens, subject to financing.
Odyssey's outstanding $68.50-a-share tender offer has been extended
to May 20.
   Pepperell's interest in Stevens has centered exclusively on the
company's sheet and towel operations, which include manufacturing
facilities as well as designer brand names. Those operations
account for 60 percent of Stevens' annual sales, which amounted to
$1.61 billion last year.
   Among the top brand names in Stevens' towel and sheet arsenal
are Ralph Lauren, Laura Ashley, Gloria Vanderbilt, Perry Ellis,
Pierre Cardin and Givenchy, among others. Pepperell's brands
include Arrow, Martex, Lady Pepperell and Burberry.
   Headquartered in New York, Stevens employs more than 23,000
people.
   The takeover maneuvering for the company began earlier this year
when management offered to buy it for $765 million.
   Pepperell and Odyssey went three rounds in a heated bidding
contest before announcing last week that they would work together
to draft a joint buyout proposal.

   Wall Streeters also are looking for a solid increase in the
Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators for
March, scheduled to be reported on Friday.
   While the expected data would be positive for corporate earnings
prospects, brokers say they could also put upward pressure on
interest rates. Thus, they say, it is a tough call how the stock
market will respond to the news.

   The number of working domestic oil and gas rigs
rose by four to total 908 this week, Baker Hughes Inc. reported
Monday.
   The rig count, the widely watched industry index of drilling
activity, gained some ground after sustaining losses of 12 and 25
in the previous two weeks. A year ago, the count totaled 765.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rigs actively
exploring for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the number of working rigs since 1940.
   The rig count reached a peak of 4,500 active rigs in December
1981, which was the height of the oil boom. But oil prices plunged
to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the
rig count went with it, dropping to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Texas, the big loser the previous week with its count dropping
by 13, posted the largest increase this week with 19 more rigs.
   Among other major oil producing states, California's count
increased by three and North Dakota's was up by two.
   Louisiana lost six rigs and Oklahoma lost two. Kansas, Wyoming
and New Mexico each lost two rigs, while Ohio, Michigan and
Pennsylvania each lost one.

<HEAD>Black Autoworkers End Strike Protesting Ford Pullout Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 black autoworkers
returned to work Monday after staging a 10-day strike in defiance
of their union to protest divestment arrangements made by Ford
Motor Co.
   The wildcat strike began April 15 at the South African Motor
Corp.'s main plant in Pretoria. The company, known as SAMCOR, said
its entire paid-by-the-hour workforce joined the strike, and the
production loss was estimated at between 1,800 to 2,000 vehicles.
   The workers were protesting an agreement signed last year by
Ford, SAMCOR and the National Union of Metalworkers under which
Ford donated the bulk of its minority holding in SAMCOR to a trust
administered by the workers.
   The trust was intended to fund development projects in the
communities where the workers live. But the workers maintain they
should receive the dividends directly.
   According to an industry source who spoke on condition of
anonymity, the strikers decided to resume work while negotiations
with the union continued to resolve the dispute over the dividends.
   The union had no immediate comment on the matter.
   Prior to its disinvestment late last year, Ford owned 42 percent
of SAMCOR. The corporation was formed in 1985 when Ford and Anglo
American Corp., South Africa's largest conglomerate, merged their
South African auto operations.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A Census Bureau report showing lower-than-expected levels of
soybean meal stocks in March supported the soy complex and the
grain markets, analysts said.
   The agency said this morning that U.S. meal stocks totaled
243,000 tons at the end of March, well short of pre-report trade
estimates of between 290,000 and 320,000 tons.
   ``This indicates that March was a very good month for domestic
use and exports,'' said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Corn was narrowly mixed in early trading. Wheat was slightly
higher amid concerns about dry weather in spring wheat growing
areas, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.16 a bushel; corn was { cent
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.00} a bushel; oats were 1
cent to 2 cents higher with May at $1.65{ a bushel; soybeans were 1
cent to 2\ cents higher with May at $6.65} a bushel.
   Cattle futures posted sharp losses in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to Friday's Agriculture
Department report showing greater-than-expected numbers of cattle
being fattened for slaughter. Pork futures also retreated.
   Live cattle were .07 cent to .97 cent lower with June at 69.85
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .67 cent lower with
April at 79.65 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .45 cent lower
with June at 48.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent
to .70 cent lower with May at 51.95 cents a pound.
   Most livestock and meat futures settled higher on Friday,
although pork bellies were lower.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.09 to 2,028.18

March, scheduled to be reported on Friday.
   While the expected data would be positive for corporate earnings
prospects, brokers say they could also put upward pressure on

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Contract Dispute Case Involving Exxon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether Exxon Company U.S.A., a division of Exxon Corp., waited too
long in seeking to collect on a $19.5 million standby letter of
credit in a contract dispute with a Houston oil company.
   The justices said they will use the case to decide a procedural
point on the relationship of federal and state court rulings in
cases based on state law.
   Standby letters of credit are common in the business world. They
are issued by banks to assure the prompt payment of money to one
signer of a contract if the other signer fails to live up to the
contract's terms.
   The bank issuing such a letter of credit is required to make
payment only if it is presented with specified documents within a
specified time.
   Exxon in 1981 contracted with Houston Oil & Refining Inc. to
make reciprocal deliveries of crude oil.
   Exxon agreed to ship 558,000 barrels of oil to Houston Oil
during July 1981, and Houston Oil agreed to ship an equal quantity
of oil to Exxon from September through December of that year.
   Houston Oil was issued a $19.3 million standby letter of credit
by Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas (Paribas) that said $19.3
million would be payable upon certification that Houston Oil failed
to deliver the promised oil between September and December 1981.
   But the certification had to be presented to Paribas ``not later
than October 1981'' _ an inconsistency with the contract's terms.
   Exxon, which delivered 558,000 barrels of oil to Houston Oil in
July 1981, learned sometime in November 1981 that Houston Oil would
not be delivering any oil to it.
   Exxon requested payment from Paribas on the letter of credit but
the bank refused, contending that Exxon's request was too late.
   Exxon sued in federal court even though its lawsuit, alleging
the wrongful dishonor of a letter of credit, was based on Texas
contract law. Exxon could do that so-called ``diversity
jurisdiction'' rules because Paribas is not based in Texas.
   A federal trial judge ruled for Exxon but the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals last Oct. 8 reversed that ruling. ``We find that
the obligation of the issuing bank had terminated even though it
might not have been possible to present to the bank the documents
required for payment bvefore the expiry date,'' the appeals court
said.
   While Exxon's request for a rehearing was pending before the 5th
Circuit court, a Texas appeals court ruled in a very similar case
that under such circumstances a letter of credit's expiration date
is unenforceable.
   In the appeal acted on today, Exxon is asking the justices to
rule that the federal appeals court _ faced with a clearer
definition of state law _ should set aside its October ruling and
reconsider the case in light of the state court's intepretation of
Texas law.
   Lawyers for Paribas argued that the 5th Circuit court's ruling
was based on ``well-settled principles of Texas law'' and should
not be reviewed.
   The case is Exxon Company U.S.A. vs. Banque de Paris et des
Pays-bas, 87-1467.

   IBM Corp. shareholders today defeated a
proposal that would have forced the computer giant to stop selling
its products in racially segregated South Africa.
   At its annual meeting, shareholders also rejected proposals to
have IBM managers disclose experiments conducted on animals, to
deny company benefit payments for abortions and related services
and to report political contributions.
   The South African sales proposal received the most support among
shareholders, but still got less than 10 percent of approximately
400 million shares voted.
   Chairman John F. Akers said IBM is becoming leaner and more
aggressive against competitors.
   ``If we have learned anything during the past few years, we have
learned that our industry _ the information industry _ is a
volatile one and IBM is subject to that volatility,'' Akers said.
   ``If we are to continue to deliver improved financial results,
we must continue to enhance our competitiveness, and we intend to
do so.''
   IBM holds is annual shareholders' meeting at various points
around the country. Last year's gathering was in New Orleans.

<HEAD>Whatever Happened to the Cashless Society?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the beginning, mankind traded goods
themselves _ a bushel of grain in exchange for a cow or a pelt in
trade for a weapon.
   As skills developed and trade expanded it became easier to use
mediums of exchange _ analogs such as metals or beads or other
things prized for their beauty or rarity.
   And then we created coins, which substituted for the beautiful
or rare precious objects that had substituted earlier for the
actual products being traded. And then we invented checks, which
substituted for cash.
   All these were great steps forward, and of course they portended
even greater changes to come. But marketplace evolution apparently
isn't a steady ascent in sophistication. We've been stalled ever
since.
   Which, in a fashion, is prelude to the question of what ever
happened to the cashless society and its cousin, the checkless
society? Twenty years ago they appeared imminent. The leaders of
technology said so.
   Instead of the customer handling cash, the bank would
electronically adjust the customer's balance, transferring funds to
the accounts of creditors named by the customer. Less need for
cash, and almost no need for checks.
   While embraced by industry, the checkless and cashless society
gained no more acceptance among consumers than the picturephone or
ordering products by electronic computer.
   A good idea, perhaps, but not just yet. While advocates swear
their time is coming, they concede that at the moment mankind seems
to have achieved a level of marketplace sophistication that suits
consumers fine.
   A study made at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco shows
that cash and checks will be around for a while more. It found that
57 percent of families pay by check, 36 percent by cash and only 7
percent by credit cards.
   There are more dollars in the hands of the public now than ever
before, says the bank's Michael Keely. And the total is growing
fast, rising to $200 billion in 1987 from $148 billion in 1983.
   Why do we like to keep dealing in cash?
   It's convenient, says Keeley, and almost everyone is likely to
agree. It takes less time to handle than a check or credit card. It
often costs less to pay by cash. And cash is direct and
uncomplicated, thus highly acceptable.
   Even automatic tellers, those impersonal machines stationed in
bank lobbies and reception areas, prefer cash. They are even more
rudimentary than the least sophisticated consumers. They cannot
deal with checks.
   The banks that employ the automatic tellers are just as
insistent on cash, since banks can process money _ exchange old
bills for new _ at the Fed without charge, whereas they pay a fee
for the Fed's check-processing services.
   Why should people prefer checks to automatic electronic
payments? Among the possibilities: Better record-keeping, more
personal control, and a greater variety of options, such as who to
pay first, and when and how much.
   But beneath all these obvious explanations is one that may apply
to a host of electronic devices that have been proposed over the
past two decades, a feeling that they're not fully understood and,
especially, not even needed.

   Boeing Co. said Monday it received a $1.4 billion
order for 30 jetliners from International Leisure Group, parent
company of Britain's Air Europe.
   The order includes 22 757-200s and eight 737-400s, subject to
the completion of financing. It was one of the largest orders ever
by a foreign carrier for Boeing 757s, and the second-largest on
record for that jetliner.
   The 757s, powered by Rolls-Royce RB211-535E4 engines, will be
delivered beginning 1989. Each plane can seat up to 185 passengers.
   The first of the eight 737s will be delivered in April 1990.
Each 737-400 can seat up to 159 passengers.
   Air Europe and its Spanish associate, Air Europa, already had an
additional four 757s and five 737s on order.
   Boeing now has 270 firm orders for various models of the 757,
and 2,036 orders for 737s, the best-selling jetliner of all time.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co.
have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the $2.6 billion buyout by
Bridgestone Corp. of Japan, Firestone Chairman John J. Nevin said
today.
   The Japanese tiremaker's $80-a-share offer was supported by 99.3
percent of the 58 percent of shareholders who voted on the
question, said Nevin, who announced the outcome at a special
shareholders' meeting this morning.
   Bridgestone's tender offer expires Tuesday, and the acquisition
could become effective Wednesday, Nevin said.
   Approval of the Bridgestone offer comes on the heels of General
Motors Corp.'s announcement that it would drop Firestone as a tire
supplier for its vehicles.
   Nevin would not speculate on why GM made the decision.
   ``To a Japanese company, the long term is considerably more
important. We'll look at this as anything one has to deal with in
the business world and decide what path the company has to take in
the future,'' said Bridgestone spokesman Dennis Allen.
   GM spokesman James Crellin said the automaker's action was part
of ``our rationalization study,'' which is a periodic review of
capacity and future needs of suppliers.
   Crellin declined to discuss how long the phaseout of Firestone
tires would take or discuss the amount of business GM does with its
suppliers.
   ``We've got four other tire suppliers: General Tire, Goodyear,
Michelin and Uniroyal-Goodrich,'' Crellin said. ``There are no
plans to look for another supplier at this time. We will be
informing the other four tire suppliers of the availability of
increased business.''
   Nevin said in a statement issued Saturday that he was
``surprised and disappointed'' by GM's move but said Firestone is
confident it will find other markets for its tires without hurting
profits.
   Firestone's statement offered no reason for GM's action, but the
company said it was ``advised by Bridgestone that the action will
have no effect'' on the $80-a-share buyout offer.
   Firestone said the phase-out would occur over two years.
   Estimates in the trade publication Modern Tire Dealer show that
GM buys about 34 percent of its tires from Uniroyal-Goodrich,
making it GM's largest tire supplier. Goodyear is second at 22.5
percent, Firestone third with 20 percent, General Tire fourth at
17.5 percent and Michelin fifth at 4.5 percent.
   Firestone moved its corporate headquarters in November from
Akron, Ohio, to Chicago. It operates four U.S. plants with 1,400
employees at its main plant in Akron.
   Firestone agreed to be acquired in March by Bridgestone, after
an unsolicited takeover bid by Italy's Pirelli SpA.
   Kimball Firestone, a Firestone board member and grandson of
Firestone founder Harvey S. Firestone, said he did not know what
Bridgestone planned to do after the takeover, but he did not
foresee shakeups in the company's top management.
   ``I think it is tight,'' he said of Firestone's corporate
leadership structure. ``I have an impression Bridgestone plans to
leave top management. But it's their call.''
   He said it also seemed logical to leave the headquarters for
Firestone's North American tire-making operation in Akron.
   Firestone is the nation's second-largest tiremaker after
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., with tires accounting for nearly 70
percent of its $4.2 billion in annual sales.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange closed
higher Monday, boosted by a stronger start on Wall Street and a
spate of late buying.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 6
points, or 0.3 percent, at 1,777.6.
   Volume was a scant 307.1 million shares, compared with Friday's
514.9 million shares.
   Traders said the stronger Wall Street opening helped to raise
most share prices from their midday doldrums.
   But traders said interest in opening new positions in the market
remained slim in the absence of new market-affecting news and ahead
of Thursday's release of first-quarter profit figures for Imperial
Chemical Industries PLC, one of Britain's largest companies, and
Friday's U.K. trade data for March.
   ``The main feature of this market is that volume remains
strikingly slim,'' one equity salesman said.
   Even issues that were the center of takeover talk last week
``have seemed to fade from the public's consciousness,'' he added.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
Monday it was delaying by two months the effective date of a rule
designed to make it easier for investors to shop for mutual funds.
   The commission said mutual funds can wait until July 1 before
they must calculate yield in a standardized way so that consumers
can readily compare the track records of competing funds.
   When the commission decided on the new rule in January, it set
May 1 as the effective date. However, the Investment Company
Institute, a trade group for mutual funds, said its members needed
more time to adjust their computer and accounting systems.
   The SEC, in response, has decided to allow funds to advertise
their yield using the old methods of calculation through the end of
June. However, the funds will have to disclose in the ads that the
yield is not computed according to SEC standards.
   Shares in mutual funds are offered by investment companies that
collect money from investors to buy stocks, bonds, commodities,
options and other investment products.

<TEXT>
   Farmers Group Inc., facing a hostile takeover
attempt by a British-owned conglomerate, said Monday its board of
directors has ended talks on a possible leveraged buyout and would
prefer that the company stay independent.
   The insurer's board members, in a meeting Saturday, also
repeated their opposition to the $4.5 billion offer from Batus
Inc., which is owned by BAT Industries PLC of Britain, Farmers said.
   There was no immediate response from Batus, which has
headquarters in Louisville, Ky.
   The possibility of a leveraged buyout has been alluded to in
sparring over the Batus offer, but the name of the entity with
which the talks were held hasn't been revealed. The board voted
unanimously to end discussions of a leveraged buyout, Farmers said.
   ``While the company is continuing to explore possible
alternatives, the board reaffirmed its view that the interests of
Farmers and its shareholders would be best served by the company
remaining an independent entity,'' Farmers said.
   Farmers, which ranks third in the nation in home and auto
insurance and is the seventh-largest property and casualty insurer,
has said it is willing to talk with Batus, but the two companies
have failed to agree on ground rules for negotiations.
   Batus is a retailing, tobacco and paper companies whose better
known operations include Saks Fifth Avenue department stores and
Kool cigarettes.

<HEAD>SmithKline Reports Increase in Sales, Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp. on Monday reported a 14 percent
increase in its first quarter profit, boosted by strong sales in
its eye-care division and a weak American dollar.
   The Philadelphia-based company said net income for the first
three months of this year totaled $116.5 million, or $1.34 a share,
compared with earnings of $146.4 million, or $1.15 per share, a
year ago.
   Sales rose 16 percent, to $1.16 billion from $1 billion in 1987.
   ``The sales gain was marked by strong performance from the
diagnostic-analytical and eye care groups together with favorable
currency exchange rates,'' said Chairman Henry Wendt.
   ``The weaker U.S. dollar had the effect of adding $55 million to
corporate sales. Ethical pharmaceutical sales, marked by strong
international results, were 10 percent above last year's first
quarter,'' he said.
   The company reported an increase of 14 percent in worldwide
sales of Tagamet, an ulcer drug, but a 35 percent decrease in the
sales of Dyazide, a hypertension medicine. Wendt blamed the drop on
generic competition and wholesaler buying patters.
   SmithKline reported that Allegan, Inc., the company's eye-care
business, recorded a 30 percent sales increase. With the inclusion
of Allergan Hydron, a contact lens company acquired late last year,
the increase totaled 50 percent.

currencies in quiet European trading Monday. Gold prices also edged
higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the market got a small boost from
a statement by West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Pohl that
the dollar would drop further and such a fall would ``be contrary
to the interests of the United States.''
   But they said most market attention focused on the British
currency following a statement Sunday by Britain's Chancellor of
the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that he didn't want sterling to rise
further.
   The pound ended lower late Monday at $1.8730, cheaper for buyers
than the $1.8880-level it reached Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 125.00 yen. Later, in
London, it fell back to 124.60 yen.
   Financial markets in Italy were closed for a national holiday.
In Europe, the dollar was selling for 1,245.50 lire late Monday, up
slightly from 1,244.50 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates, compared with late Friday's rates:
1.6765 West German marks, up from 1.6730; 1.3860 Swiss francs, up
from 1.3840; 5.6915 French francs, up from 5.6865; 1.8790 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8770; and 1.2309 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2324.
   Gold closed in London at $449.50 a troy ounce, up from Friday's
$449 In Zurich, the late bid price was $450 an ounce, up from $449
late Friday, but dealers said trading was dull and trendless.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to $451.13 an ounce from
Saturday's $451.58.
   Silver was quoted in London late Monday at a bid price of $6.42
a troy ounce, down from Friday's $6.46.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade despite indications
early in the session that demand for soybean products was stronger
than anticipated.
   The soybean complex had led the grain markets higher in early
trading after the Census Bureau reported lower-than-expected stocks
of U.S. soybean meal at the end of March.
   The numbers indicated greater domestic usage and exports of
soybean meal, but ``with the expectation downstream for poor
domestic use and export, the market couldn't hold,'' said Richard
Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York.
   The soybean market also sold off on expectations that the weekly
U.S. Department of Agrigulture export inspections report would show
8 million to 11 million bushels of soybeans were approved for
shipment last week. But the report, issued after the close, showed
soybean inspections totaled more than 13.1 million bushels.
   Corn futures also weakened on poor export sales. The wheat
market succumbed to continuing fears about dryness in the spring
wheat growing region of the northern Plains, Loewy said.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.11\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
1} cents lower with May at $1.99{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 2\
cents higher with May at $1.65 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to
4{ cents lower with May at $6.59 a bushel.

   Workers with their sights set on moving up in the
business world may do better in eyeglasses, says a new study that
found corporate recruiters look favorably on the bespectacled.
   The survey, conducted by the Dallas-based Pearle Vision Center,
found 79 percent of the corporate recruiters and fashion-image
consultants queried said that glasses connote intelligence.
Sixty-nine percent said they viewed glasses as enhancing a
professional image.
   Joseph Dono, Pearle's senior vice president of marketing, said
Monday that the survey doesn't necessarily mean the 20-20 set
should rush to buy glasses, but it could be a consideration for
those who need corrective lenses.
   ``Eyeglasses are not only functional for vision correction, but
they also make a statement about the individual wearing them,''
Dono said. ``Today's consumer may purchase glasses as a fashion
accessory, or to project a more business-like image for that `board
room' look.''
   Pearle researchers interviewed 100 corporate recruiters and
image consultants in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San
Francisco. About 60 percent of those polled recruit either for
executive-level positions or for the financial or communications
field.
   The survey reported 80 percent of the respondents think
eyeglasses help the wearer focus on making a power statement during
a business presentation.
   Removing glasses at strategic points is considered an effective
way to emphasize a particular word or phrase. A third of those
surveyed admitted using glasses for such a purpose.
   ``It's an eye-opener to people who are buying eyeglasses
today,'' Dono said. ``Many people who are buying glasses today
haven't bought eyewear in about two years. Everything has changed
since then. The materials are running the gamut from plastic to
metal to carbon, a very light metal, titanium. And then there are
cosmetic tints available on the lenses and lightweight plastic
lenses.''
   The poll showed the best choice for the work environment for
both men and women is the the classic tortoise-shell frame style,
which for years has suggested a studious, ``bookworm'' image for
the wearer.
   The second-most popular styles with recruiters on men were wire
frames, while ultra-modern designer frames ranked second for women
applicants.
   It may seem ironic that the survey favors wearing glasses at a
time when contact lenses have advanced to include not only hard and
soft lenses, but also gas-permeable, extended-wear and
eye-color-changing lenses.
   ``Not everyone can wear contacts, and many people do not like to
wear contacts,'' Dono said.
   ``The fact that there are designer labels and quality brands
isn't enough of an attraction for everyone,'' Dono said. ``But
amongst people who have to wear glasses, the choices are more
appealing today than they were five years ago.
   Dono said there may be some upwardly mobile business-types who
will begin wearing eyeglasses even if they don't need them because
of poor vision.
   ``There are some people who will and already do wear them for
that reason, but that's a small minority,'' Dono said. ``I mean,
many people wear sunglasses not for the effects on they have on
cutting out sunlight, but because the people think they look good.''

<HEAD>Desert Partners Completes Financing for USG Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Desert Partners L.P., a partnership headed by
two Texas oilmen, announced Monday that it has finished arranging
the necessary financing for its $1.6 billion cash tender offer for
manufacturer USG Corp.'s stock.
   Desert Partners said it has lined up financing commitments
totaling $1.9 billion, including a $1.4 billion bank facility and
$500 million in subordinated debt.
   The partnership, led by oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and Jack E.
Brown, has offered $42 a share in cash for up to 39 million shares
of USG's 45.7 million common shares it doesn't already own. In
addition, Desert Partners would offer around $600 million in debt
securities and warrants, or rights to purchase stock, also valued
at $42 each, for the balance of the deal.
   The cash and securities portions of the takeover bid have a
total value of around $2.2 billion.
   Chicago-based USG, a manufacturer of paper, plaster and wood
products, including gypsum wallboard, has rejected Desert Partners'
offer as inadequate.
   Desert Partners, based in Midland, Texas, holds about 9.9
percent of USG's common shares, acquired last fall for an average
of $45 a share.
   The partnership's $1.4 billion bank facility, arranged by Wells
Fargo Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank, includes $170 million
available only for the payment of interest and expenses.
   The commitments for subordinated debt consist of $300 million
from the investment and finance subsidiaries of Elders IXL Ltd., an
Australian conglomerate, and $200 million from U.S. investment firm
Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc.
   USG's profit for the first quarter, reported Monday, dropped to
$39.7 million, or 77 cents a share, from $85 million, or $1.65 a
share, in the first three months of 1987. First-quarter sales rose,
on the other hand, to $715.2 million from $693.2 million a year
earlier.
   The company said shipments of its products, including gypsum
board, were at high levels but selling prices for domestic gypsum
board were 17 percent below the 1987 first-quarter level.
   USG is the holding company for United States Gypsum Co., USG
Interiors Inc., Masonite Corp. and several other operating
subsidiaries.
   Desert Partners tried last October to acquire USG, but the
partnership said in January that market conditions had forced it to
abandon its plan to offer more than $2.5 billion, or over $50 a
share, for the company.
   In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Desert Partners said it intends to explore alternatives to the
acquisition of USG, including an attempt to elect nominees to USG's
board of directors at the annual meeting next month.
   USG sued Desert Partners late last year, claiming that the
partnership violated federal securities law in its negotiations
with USG.

<HEAD>Exxon, Mobil, Other Companies Report Strong Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN C. GIVEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major U.S. oil companies, led by top-ranking
Exxon Corp. and second-largest Mobil Corp., reported strong
improvements in their first-quarter earnings Monday, many citing
sharp gains in refining and marketing, as well as chemicals.
   Amoco Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Unocal Corp. also
reported hefty increases.
   Exxon said its earnings were up 36 percent to $1.46 billion, or
$1.06 per share, compared with $1.07 billion, or 75 cents per
share, in the 1987 first quarter. Sales totaled $22.0 billion vs.
$19.4 billion a year earlier, it said.
   Mobil said its quarterly profit doubled to $505 million, or
$1.23 per share, compared with $252 million, or 62 cents per share
in the 1987 period. Revenue from continuing operations totaled
$13.8 billion vs. $11.7 billion in the first three months of last
year.
   Both companies are based in New York.
   Among the others:
   _Amoco, of Chicago, said its earnings leaped 80.4 percent, to
$469 million, or $1.82 per share, vs. 1987 first-quarter earnings
of $260 million, or $1.02 per share. Sales totaled $5.8 billion in
the first three months, compared with $5.2 billion in the 1987
period, the nation's fifth-largest petroleum company said.
   _Occidental, ranked seventh, said its earnings increased by 16.5
percent to $113 million, or 52 cents per share, compared with $97
million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Both periods
included extraordinary gains, however.
   The Los Angeles-based company said its sales totaled $4.48
billion in the three months, compared with $4.16 billion in the
1987 first quarter.
   _Unocal said its earnings nearly tripled, but were also affected
by special items. The company, ranked 13th-largest, is also
headquartered in Los Angeles.
   Unocal's quarterly earnings totaled $178.4 million, or $1.53 per
share, on $2.3 billion of revenue, vs. $60.7 billion, or 52 cents
per share, on sales of $2.06 billion in the same period of 1987.
   Included in those results were a $456 million one-time gain due
to an accounting change related to income taxes. This was partially
offset by an post-tax charge of $322 million for a writedown of
certain company assets, the company said.
   ``Excess supplies and weak winter demand associated with
warmer-than-normal weather caused crude prices to move sharply
lower during the quarter. Crude prices in last year's first quarter
were higher and relatively stable,'' observed Exxon Chairman L.G.
Rawl.
   The sharply lower crude prices, together with much stronger
margins for petroleum products and record chemical earnings were
``fundamentally responsible'' for Exxon's overall earnings
improvement, he added.
   ``The quarterly comparison was helped by sale of property abroad
and lower incentive compensation costs in 1988, but the effect of
these benefits was largely offset by the absence of 1987 foreign
exchange gains and tax credits associated with foreign
operations,'' Rawl said.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said the company's quarterly
performance was the best since 1981, with the most important
improvements occurring in its domestic refining and marketing
segment and chemicals, which posted its ``best quarter ever.''
   The latest report did not reflect the impact of Mobil's
Montgomery Ward unit, which was sold on March 7. Mobil said the
retailer made $19 million in profits, compared with $8 million in
the first quarter of 1987. Those profits and proceeds from the sale
will be posted in the second quarter, the company said.
   Amoco Chairman Richard M. Morrow attributed the company's
performance to substantial strengthening of refined product
margins, compared with the same period last year, along with
continued record earnings by its chemicals division.
   In Los Angeles, Occidental Chairman Armand Hammer said chemical
operations more than tripled during the quarter.
   The company said its 1988 results included an after-tax gain of
$53 million, primarily from the sale of a 25 percent interest in
its Colombia oil holdings, as well as extraordinary gains of $2
million, primarily from capital loss carryforwards.
   Its 1987 first-quarter results included a post-tax gain of $103
million from the sale of certain chemical operations plus $24
million in capital loss carryforwards.
   Fred L. Hartley, Unocal's chairman, said the main negative
factors affecting quarterly performance were higher dry hole costs
and exploratory expense and lower geothermal earnings and domestic
crude prices.
   These were offset somewhat by higher natural gas production in
Thailand and higher refining and marketing profits, he added.
   The writedowns included Unocal's remaining investment in a shale
oil project, about half its investment in mining and processing
facilities in New Mexico and Pennsylvania and 40 percent of its
investment in certain coking facilities at its Chicago refinery.

<HEAD>Cassoni Returning to Olivetti, Kavner To Succeed Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s
computer products division is leaving to rejoin the office
equipment giant Ing. C. Olivetti SpA of Italy, AT&T announced
Monday.
   Vittorio Cassoni, who had been head of Olivetti's North American
operations before joining AT&T in 1986, will be nominated as
managing director of the Italian company, AT&T said in a statement.
   Robert M. Kavner, AT&T's chief financial officer, was named to
replace Cassoni as president of the company's Data Systems Group.
   The announcement came a week after Robert E. Allen succeeded
James E. Olson as AT&T chairman. Olson, who had headed the
telecommunications giant since September 1986, died of cancer.
   Cassoni, 45, joined AT&T after the American company and Olivetti
signed a 10-year agreement under which Olivetti began to produce
personal computers for both firms.
   Wall Street analysts said they did not know whether Cassoni's
departure was being planned before Olson's death, although Allen
said in a statement, ``When we brought Vittorio to AT&T in 1986, it
was understood that he would eventually return to Olivetti.''
   ``No one knows the answer to that,'' said John Bain, who tracks
AT&T for the investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``I'm
tempted to say it must have been; they wouldn't undertake something
at this high level at a whim.''
   Olivetti was disappointed recently by AT&T's refusal to increase
its 23 percent stake in the Italian company, but Bain said it was
not known if there was a connection between that event and
Cassoni's resignation.
   Analysts also said it was too early to tell what effect the
change might have on the Data Systems Group, which is responsible
for the development and marketing of AT&T's computer products.
   ``It is a loss,'' Thomas McKeever, an analyst at First Boston
Corp. said of Cassoni's departure.
   However, McKeever added: ``A good chunk of his work is behind.
They have laid the foundation and gotten a dedicated sales force.''
   Bain, noting Cassoni's overhaul of AT&T's national marketing
system, said, ``If he has gotten things turned about ... this could
be viewed as a very positive step.'' But, he said, ``We don't
know.''
   Under Cassoni, the Data Systems Group agreed to develop a new
version of AT&T's Unix computer with Sun Microsystems Inc. AT&T has
also agreed to acquire a stake of up to 20 percent in Sun.
   The Data Systems Group is currently vying for a $4.5 billion
contract to supply 20,000 computers to the Air Force and other
defense agencies. Digital Equipment Corp. and Wang Laboratories
Inc. dropped out of the bidding recently, claiming the deal favored
AT&T.
   Bain said the Data Systems position could be a testing ground
for Kavner.
   ``If he can be a general purpose executive rather than just an
accountant, there could be higher things in the cards down the
road,'' Bain said.
   Kavner, 44, joined AT&T in 1984 after 10 years as a partner at
Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting and consulting firm.

   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said Monday its first
quarter profit nearly tripled despite a wider loss at its ABC
Television Network.
   The communications giant warned that its business outlook for
the rest of the year ``is not as encouraging,'' however, because of
anticipated weak advertising demand for the television network and
specialized publications.
   Capital Cities said it earned $70.3 million, or $4.16 a share,
in the three months ended April 4 compared with $23.9 million, or
$1.43 a share, a year earlier.
   First quarter revenue rose 34 percent to $1.29 billion from $959
million a year earlier.
   On an operating basis, income rose 72.2 percent to $167 million
in the quarter from $97.3 million in 1987.
   Broadcasting revenue, which includes revenue for the company's
eight television stations, 21 radio stations and its 80 percent
interest in the ESPN cable network as well as for the ABC
Television network, rose 44 percent to $1.04 billion mainly due to
the 1988 telecasts of the Super Bowl football game and the Winter
Olympics games.
   Operating income in broadcasting rose 86 percent to $164.4
million from $88 million a year earlier.
   Nonetheless, the ABC Television Network reported a
``significantly increased loss'' in the quarter. The company did
not provide a specific loss figure for either period. The network
earned $50 million in all of 1987.
   The company said continuing cost control efforts and income from
the telecast of the Super Bowl by the network failed to offset a
loss in excess of $65 million from the broadcast of the Winter
Olympics.
   The network spent about $350 million for the rights to the games
and production of the telecast but generated only about $285
million in revenue, according to spokesman Joseph Fitzgerald.
   The company said operating earnings for the company's television
stations and ESPN were well ahead of last year.
   Publishing revenue rose 4 percent to $246 million, but
publishing earnings declined 17.5 percent to $28.7 million.
   The company said there were modest revenue gains in the
newspaper and shopping guide operations, partly offset by weakness
in specialized publications.

   Stock prices moved ahead in quiet trading Monday
amid expectations of further signs of a healthy economic outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 22.21 points to
2,037.30.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 2 in New
York Stock Exchange-listed trading, with 939 up, 603 down and 470
unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 156.95 million shares, against 152.52
million in the previous session. The NYSE's composite index rose
1.18 to 148.21.
   The government is due to issue a report Tuesday on the progress
of the economy for the first quarter of the year.
   Advance estimates on Wall Street call for the figure on
inflation-adjusted growth of the gross national product to come in
somewhere between 2 percent and 2{ percent at an annual rate.
   Wall Streeters also are looking for a solid increase in the
Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators for
March, scheduled to be reported on Friday.
   While the expected data would be positive for corporate earnings
prospects, brokers say the figures could also put upward pressure
on interest rates. Thus, they say, it is a tough call how the stock
market will respond to the news.
   Mobil rose 1] to 47\ and Exxon was up } at 44}. Both companies
reported strong first-quarter earnings.
   Auto issues were broadly higher as the industry posted a slight
gain in mid-April domestic car sales. General Motors rose 1\ to
74|; Ford Motor 1\ to 47[, and Chrysler { to 23}.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up

and DuPont, up 1} at 84].
   Southern Co. led the active list, up \ at 22~ in a blizzard of
block trades focused on the company's impending quarterly dividend.
Volume in the stock surpassed 28 million shares.
   EMC Corp. was the day's biggest percentage loser, tumbling 4| to
7]. Late Friday the company, a producer of computer products, said
its first-quarter results fell short of expectations, with earnings
per share of about three or four cents.
   In the over-the-counter market, Major Video added { to 9|.
Blockbuster Entertainment plans to acquire Major Video through an
exchange of stock.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $19 billion, or 0.73
percent, in value.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 179.03 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.91 to 305.83, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.32 at 262.46.

   The dollar ended mixed in light trading Monday,
reflecting dealer reluctance to speculate prior to potentially
market-moving developments later this week.
   Gold prices fell marginally after rising in Europe and falling
in Asia. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at $447.50 a troy
ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, compared with $449.50 late Friday.
   Money dealers attributed the dollar's mixed behavior partly to
uncertainty about the impact of a government report on
first-quarter U.S. economic growth due out Tuesday.
   They also said the Senate's impending vote on a major trade
bill, along with questions about the outcome of a planned OPEC
meeting with non-cartel oil exporters, injected uncertainty into
foreign exchange trading.
   ``There's not much to say today,'' said Christianne Mandell, a
trading analyst at the New York branch of Britain's Barclay's Bank
PLC. ``It was quiet because there's anticipation about events that
are happening later. Until those things come out, there won't be
information to trade on.''
   Traders said the Commerce Department's report on the gross
national product would be a tricky number to interpret. Estimates
range between 1.5 percent and 3 percent, but it will be the
underlying components of that figure that influence the dollar's
value.
   For example, if first-quarter GNP is high, that could boost the
dollar provided that the growth was caused by strength in exports,
thereby helping reduce the trade deficit. But if the growth was
caused by strong consumer demand for foreign goods, that suggests
higher imports, a widening trade deficit and a further decline in
the dollar.
   On the other hand, a substantially lower GNP could boost the
dollar because it implies a slowdown in imports. But it also could
hurt the dollar by relieving pressure for higher domestic interest
rates, traders said.
   ``It's really a Catch-22 situation,'' said Alberto Soria,
foreign exchange manager at the New York branch of Swiss Bank Corp.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.35 yen to a closing 125.00 yen. In London
it retreated to 124.60 yen, and in New York it traded at 124.73
yen, down from 124.91 yen late Friday.
   The British pound fell in London to $1.8730, cheaper than the
$1.8880 reached Friday, largely because of weekend remarks by
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson that sterling
shouldn't rise further. In New York the pound fetched $1.8736,
cheaper than $1.8840 quoted Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Friday: 1.6753 West German marks, down from 1.6758; 1.3873 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3849; 1.2317 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2324;
5.6862 French francs, up from 5.6845; and 1,244.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,244.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Friday: 1.6765
West German marks, up from 1.6730; 1.3860 Swiss francs, up from
1.3840; 5.6915 French francs, up from 5.6865; 1.8790 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8770; and 1.2309 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2324; 1,245.50 lire, up from 1,244.50.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
fetched $448.90 an ounce, down $2.
   Gold closed in London at $449.50 a troy ounce, up from $449
Friday. In Zurich the late bid price was $450 vs. $449, and in Hong
Kong it was $451.13 vs. $451.58.
   On the Comex, silver for current delivery fetched $6.355, off 5
cents. Silver was quoted in London late Monday at a bid price of
$6.42 a troy ounce, down from $6.46 Friday.

   The investment firm TLC Group L.P. said Monday
it has retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to explore the sale of
three European-based Beatrice International companies.
   The companies include Britain-based Callard & Bowser Group,
which makes and markets confectionery products; Britain-based
Beatrice Poultry, which produces and sells poultry under the
Butterball name and private labels; and Beatrice International
Bottling Group of the Netherlands and Belgium, which manufactures
soft drinks under the 7Up, Sunkist, RC Cola and Canada Dry brand
names.
   TLC said in a statement that over the past three months it has
received purchase inquiries about the businesses.
   TLC, founded by Reginald F. Lewis in 1983, completed the nearly
$1 billion leveraged buyout of Beatrice International in December.
Since then TLC has sold off a number of Beatrice's overseas
operations.

<HEAD>Bank Of New York Extends Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New York Co. said Monday that it
extended until Wednesday its $1 billion-plus hostile offer for
Irving Bank Corp.
   Meanwhile, both companies continued to exchange barbs, with Bank
of New York saying it would not hold any more merger talks with
Irving because the bank ``never intended to negotiate seriously.''
   Irving countered by saying it is ``disappointed'' by Bank of New
York's refusal to bargain and said its board ``remains fully
committed to obtaining the best transaction for its shareholders.''
   Bank of New York ``should return to the negotiating table if it
wants to convince Irving shareholders that its offer is the best
obtainable,'' Irving said in a statement.
   Bank of New York is offering $15 in cash and 1.575 of its common
shares for all of Irving's approximately 18 million shares
outstanding. The tender offer, which had been set to expire last
Friday, began a month ago following regulatory approval.
   As of the close of business Friday, Bank of New York said 7.68
million Irving shares had been tendered.
   Bank of New York also is running a slate of 16 nominees for
Irving's board of directors.
   Irving, however, is urging its shareholders to approve a complex
restructuring plan that includes selling a major stake to Banca
Commerciale Italiana, Italy's second-largest bank.
   Banca Commerciale Italiana, which emerged as a friendly merger
partner last week, has offered to pay $75 a share for 8.5 million
Irving shares, or a 45 percent stake in the company. Banca
Commerciale also would have the right to buy an additional 10
percent of Irving stock on the open market after the deal was
consummated.
   Bank of New York has said that Bankca Commerciale is unlikely to
receive the necessary regulatory approvals.
   Irving's proposed restructuring also includes the sale of
assets, such as its 50-story Wall Street headquarters, cost-cutting
measures, and a $10-a-share special cash dividend.
   Irving's annual shareholders' meeting is scheduled for May 6.

   Copper futures prices sank Monday on the Commodity Exchange in
New York amid perceptions that demand for the metal is declining
and supplies are on the rise. Precious metals futures also
retreated on the Comex.
   On other exchanges, energy futures were mixed; grain and soybean
futures were mostly lower; livestock and meat were mixed; and
stock-index futures advanced.
   The most active copper contract, for delivery in May, fell 2.65
cents to settle at 90.95 cents a pound.
   Indications of slackening demand and rising supplies have pushed
copper futures down nearly 10 cents a pound in the last two weeks
and the market continues to display technical and fundamental
weakness, analysts said.
   ``Even though you have fairly tight supplies in the near term,
demand is not enough to justify these high prices,'' said Jack
Barbanel, director of futures trading at New York-based Gruntal &
CO.
   Stephen Platt, metals analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago, said he expected demand for copper to weaken further as
summer approaches.
   Precious metal futures retreated in reaction to the dollar's
recent strength, lower commodity prices in general and beliefs that
higher interest rates are just around the bend, the analysts said.
   Trading activity was light ahead of Tuesday's release of monthly
government figures on economic growth and the opening Tuesday
afternoon of a meeting between the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and non-OPEC oil-producing countries, which
could lead to an inflationary agreement to limit oil production.
   Gold settled $2 to $2.30 lower with June at $450.10 a troy
ounce; silver was 5 cents lower across the board with May at $6.365
a troy ounce.
   Nervousness about Tuesday's oil meeting also overshadowed the
energy futures market at the New York Mercantile Exchange, where
prices finished mixed.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 12 cents
higher with June at $18.40 a barrel; heating oil was .04 cent to
.61 cent higher with May at 51.21 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .24 cent lower to .65 cent higher with May at 52.05 cents a
gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade despite indications early in the session that demand
for soybean products was stronger than anticipated.
   The soybean complex had led the grain markets higher in early
trading after the Census Bureau reported lower-than-expected stocks
of U.S. soybean meal at the end of March.
   Corn futures weakened on poor export sales. The wheat market
succumbed to continuing fears about dryness in the spring wheat
growing region of the northern Plains, said Richard Loewy, senior
grain and oilseed analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York.
   Wheat settled 2} cents to 3} cents lower with May at $3.11\ a
bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with May at $1.99} a
bushel; oats were { cent to 2\ cents higher with May at $1.65 a
bushel; soybeans were 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with May at $6.59 a
bushel.
   A Friday U.S. Department of Agriculture report showing
greater-than-expected numbers of cattle being fattened for
slaughter sparked a sharply lower opening in cattle futures on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, but prices recovered to finish mixed.
   Despite the report's indications of rising supplies, packing
houses were aggressive buyers of cattle on Monday, said Charlie
Richardson, an analyst in Denver with Lind-Waldock & Co.
   The early weakness in the cattle market spilled over into pork
pits, however, and persisted despite the cattle market's later
recovery, Richardson said.
   Live cattle settled .65 cent lower to .70 cent higher with June
at 70.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent lower to .20
cent higher with April at 79.95 cents a pound; hogs were .03 cent
to .68 cent lower with June at 48.42 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .40 cent lower to .08 cent higher with May at 52.10
cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures moved higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for June delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2 points higher at 263.85.

   From shoes to machines, the Soviet economy had
trouble meeting the country's needs in the first three months of
this year, the government said Monday in a sobering report on
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   Perhaps the most telling admission in the lengthy report was
that national income, the overall barometer of the country's
economic health, fell 2.6 percentage points short of the planned
level.
   National income went up 4 percent over the first quarter of
1987, whereas the plan called for an increase of 6.6 percent. The
same shortfall was reported in labor productivity.
   The first quarter of 1987, to which the new figures are being
compared, was marred by overall poor performance.
   ``Now it's important for everything designated not to remain
only on paper,'' the Council of Ministers, the government's
Cabinet, said Monday in reviewing the economic report.
   The council stressed that many of the economy's bottlenecks were
hurting the country's 285.2 million people.
   ``The shortcomings noted in the work of a series of industries
and complexes became serious brakes in the buildup of production
and increase in people's well-being,'' the council said, according
to the news agency Tass.
   The report covered a period in which a new system was introduced
in the Soviet economy. As of Jan. 1, more than 76,000 state-run
factories and farms responsible for 60 percent of the Soviet
Union's production were required to depend on themselves for the
revenue they need to operate.
   That is one of the key elements of Gorbachev's economic reforms,
aimed at giving local managers more responsibility and flexibility.
The Communist Party chief wants to limit central authorities to
overall planning of the economy and allow local managers to
exercise direct control over production plans and quotas.
   The media said the reforms were not to blame for the
shortcomings noted in the report. Industries and farms operating
under the new requirements ``are performing better than those
working in the old way,'' Radio Moscow said.
   Industrial production increased 5 percent over the first quarter
of 1987, exceeding the 4.5 percent target set in state plans, Radio
Moscow quoted Nikolai Belov, deputy head of the State Committee on
Statistics, as saying.
   Energy production, transportation equipment, computers and
medical equipment all grew strongly, the statistics said.
   But one-third of the machine-building industry, a key sector in
Gorbachev's drive for greater efficiency, did not complete its
orders, the Council of Ministers noted.
   Among the specific problems cited in the report, splashed over
two pages of the government newspaper Izvestia, were shortcomings
in consumer products. It sais 87,000 radio receivers, 44,000
washing machines and 44,000 vacuum cleaners called for in state
plans were not produced. Clothing and shoes were either in short
supply or were left unpurchased because they were old-fashioned or
of poor quality.
   In agriculture, meat, vegetable and dairy production failed to
satisfy people's needs, and in some areas bread quality and
assortment was poor, the report said.
   Of the 15 Soviet republics, Armenia had the worst record from
January to March for fulfillment of industrial contract
obligations. Armenian factories completed just 98.5 percent of
their orders, compared to a high of 99.9 percent for Byelorussia
and Latvia.
   The report also criticized Armenia for not raising workers
salaries, improving household services or building schools,
hospitals and cultural centers.
   During much of February, many of Armenia's factories, schools
and businesses were closed in a strike prompted by an ethnic
dispute.
   The report was released as U.S. intelligence agencies released
in Washington an assessment saying that Gorbachev's reforms ran
into serious obstacles in 1987.
   A joint report by the Central Intelligence Agency and the
Defense Intelligence Agency said the Soviet gross national product
increased only 0.5 percent in 1987, compared with a 3.9 percent
increase the previous year.
   It said the poor performance in 1987 was due to poor weather
that hurt farm production and resistance to change in the Soviet
bureaucracy.
   National income, the barometer the Soviets use, is a measurement
of economic activity that differs from gross national product
because it does not consider the value of some services.

   Senators traded last-minute sales pitches
Monday as they fought for votes on a sweeping trade bill advancing
in defiance of presidential veto threats.
   ``You let this bill go down the tubes and I'll tell you where
the champagne corks will be popping _ they'll be popping in Japan
and they'll be popping in Germany,'' said Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   The bill, scheduled for a Senate vote on Tuesday or Wednesday,
was expected to pass with votes to spare and the major question
remaining was whether it would get enough support to override a
veto.
   ``It's close,'' Bentsen told reporters.
   Democrats were expected to back the measure overwhelmingly while
Republicans were divided.
   The administration and its supporters said a veto would not
finish off the issue for the year and that there still would be
time to pass a stripped-down version that deleted the most
controversial provisions.
   ``I know this is an election year and the majority party may be
looking for a campaign issue rather than a trade bill, but I am
confident the Congress could pass a better bill if this one is
rejected,'' said Sen. Robert T. Stafford, D-Vt.
   The House passed the 1,000-page measure on Thursday 312-107,
more than enough support to override President Reagan's threatened
veto.
   Over the last month, the administration has focused most of its
criticism on a provision that would require all but the smallest
employers to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs.
   A number of business groups have campaigned against the measure,
saying it would dry up capital for investment, frighten off
customers and cause other problems for management.
   Basic provisions of the bill would overhaul the system under
which the United States imposes import curbs in retaliation for
international trade violations and other unfair practices.
   Among other things, it would make retaliation mandatory for
violations except in certain cases, such as national security.
   It also would transfer from the president to the U.S. trade
representative the authority to determine whether retaliation was
in order and, if so, what kind of sanctions to impose.
   Other central features would streamline the machinery under
which the United States imposes import quotas and tariffs to aid
American industries that are threatened by surges in foreign
competition.
   The measure contains scores of other features ranging from
billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies to repeal of the
windfall profits tax on earnings of oil companies.

<HEAD>Judge Tentatively Approves Settlement With Home State Accountant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge tentatively approved on Monday a
proposed $5.5 million settlement of Ohio's lawsuit against Arthur
Andersen & Co., accounting firm for the collapsed Home State
Savings Bank.
   Judge Richard A. Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Court
said he would accept objections to the proposed settlement and make
a final ruling on May 6.
   The state blamed the firm for negligence in auditing Home
State's books, which Ohio officials said contributed to the March
1985 collapse of the Cincinnati-based thrift. Arthur Andersen
denied the state's allegations and admitted no wrongdoing in
reaching the settlement.
   The settlement was reached April 15, after the case already had
gone to trial in the Ohio Court of Claims in Columbus. The case is
before Niehaus because he has jurisdiction over the state's
liquidation of Home State.
   The case is one of numerous civil suits the state filed in its
efforts to recover costs of guaranteeing all the deposits of Home
State after its collapsed. Home State was closed for three months
until another company bought and reopened it in June 1985, allowing
depositors to get their money back.
   Home State collapsed three days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission had ESM Government Securities Inc., a
securities trader in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., closed for bankruptcy
with more than $300 million in debts. Home State was ESM's biggest
investor through securities transactions, and lost $144 million
because of ESM's closing.
   Home State's failure caused a statewide crisis for 69 other Ohio
savings and loans insured by the private Ohio Deposit Guarantee
Fund of Cincinnati, which was weakened when Home State drained
backup money to cope with losses and withdrawals by panicked
depositors.
   A number of Home State and ESM have since been convicted of
crimes in connection with the failure of the two institutions.

   Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. reported Monday
that its first quarter profit from continuing operations rose by
14.2 percent from the previous year, due largely to the company's
focus on its core tire business.
   Goodyear posted net income of $95.3 million, or $1.67 per share,
all from continuing operations, during the quarter ended March 31.
That compared with a profit of $284.2 million, or $3.99 per share,
a year earlier, which included $200.8 million from discontinued
operations.
   Sales during the quarter rose to $2.6 billion from $2.3 billion
in first quarter 1987.
   Goodyear last year sold its Goodyear Aerospace, Motor Wheel and
Celeron Oil and Gas operations, plus other assets. The company sold
those assets under a major restructuring following an unsuccessful
hostile takeover attempt by the international businessman Sir James
Goldsmith.
   Goodyear Chairman Robert E. Mercer said the latest quarterly
results reflected increased global demand for the company's tire
products.
   Goodyear also reported sales growth in its other businesses,
including chemicals, film, industrial hoses, conveyor belts and
power transmission products.

   Nike Inc. said Monday it agreed to
acquire a privately-held New England shoe company in a deal valued
at around $95 million. The athletic shoe and apparel company said
it would buy Cole-Haan and related companies from Cole-Haan Limited
Partnership for $80 million plus $15 million in debt repayments.
   Cole-Haan, a 13-year-old company based in Yarmouth, Maine,
designs and markets classic-style footwear and accessories, ranging
from $85 boat moccasins to $500 lizard pumps. Its sales for the
year ended March 31 totaled about $62 million, Nike said.
   Cole-Haan founder George Denney and current management are
expected to remain at the company after the deal is complete.
   ``This is the execution of a strategy our board adopted over a
year ago,'' said Nike Chairman Philip H. Knight. ``It is a marriage
of the best in the athletic footwear industry with the premier
brand of dress and casual shoe in the business.''

   A Massachusetts-based trade show company
is acquiring the Sands Hotel and Casino, a 36-year fixture on the
Las Vegas strip, for $110 million, the company announced Monday.
   Interface Group is acquiring the Sands, a 36-year fixture on the
Las Vegas Strip, from MGM Grand Inc., which is owned by financier
Kirk Kerkorian. The purchase includes the resort-casino and 60
acres of land on the Strip.
   Sheldon Adelson, Interface's chairman, called the Sands purchase
a natural extension of the Interface operations, which already
include trade shows, a New England-based travel operation and a
small airline.
   Kerkorian will continue operating the hotel until the five
Interface partners obtain a Nevada gaming license, which could take
six months to a year, Adelson said.
   Once licensing is completed, Interface plans to build a
1,000-room tower that could cost $60 million to $70 million,
Adelson said.
   The company, based in Needham, Mass., also may build major
convention facilities on acreage purchased at the rear of the
750-room hotel and casino, which is located in the heart of the
rapidly-growing Strip.
   Adelson said Henri Lewin, former president of the Las Vegas
Hilton, would take over management of the hotel. Lewin is chairman
of Aristocrat Hotels of San Francisco, a hotel management and
consulting firm.
   Kerkorian purchased the Sands and the Desert Inn in February
from the Summa Corporation for $167 million. Kerkorian will retain
ownership of the Desert Inn.
   Interface produces the COMDEX computer industry show, the city's
second-largest, attracting nearly 100,000 delegates annually.
Interface also promotes a housewares show and a film festival in
the city, as well as computer industry shows throughout the world.
   ``We plan to integrate our travel and trade show division
vertically, so that the Sands and other Las Vegas hotels are
included in our tour packages,'' Adelson said. ``We are considering
basing one of our aircraft in Las Vegas to service this market.''
   The Interface travel division is the largest tour operator in
New England and operates four L-1011 jet aircraft under its Five
Star Airline division.

   An omnibus trade bill that President Reagan has
promised to veto could be revised easily to his liking with its
major provisions intact, the chairman of the U.S. International
Trade Commission said Monday.
   ``I think you're a bit premature in calling in the undertaker,''
Susan Liebeler told fellow panalists discussing the bill. The issue
was raised at the 102nd annual convention of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association here.
   The trade bill passed the House by 312-107 last week and is to
be voted on by the Senate this week.
   Reagan objects to a provision requiring most manufacturers to
give 60 days notice of plant closings and major layoffs.
   Liebeler said she thought that Reagan would veto the bill and
that, in a revised version, the notification provision would be
dropped and the bill approved.
   ``You may in fact see a trade bill the administration will
sign,'' she said.
   The other panalists were Makoto Kuroda, vice minister for
international affairs in Japan's Ministry of International Trade
and Industry; Pat Choate, vice president for policy at TRW Inc.;
and William H. Davidson, an associate professor at the University
of Southern California's School of Business Administration.
   The Japanese government has urged Reagan to veto the bill, which
would punish Toshiba Corp. for a subsidiary's sale of sensitive
equipment to the Soviet Union and give the U.S. trade
representative more power to deal with complaints of unfair trade
practices by foreign countries.
   The panalists were divided on the bill, with Kuroda voicing
opposition and Choate and Davidson supporting it.
   The flip side of the trade issue, Choate said, was foreign
investment in the United States, an issue he said the federal
government was ill-equipped to handle because it did not keep an
accurate count of money invested by foreigners.
   ``How can we have a good policy without good information?''
Choate asked.
   Kuroda said Japan's investment in the United States would help
revitalize the economy's of both countries and provide for
technological transfer.
   The discussion, called ``International Trade: Is Protectionism
Dead?'', was moderated by Karen Elliot House, foreign editor of the
Wall Street Journal.
   The panel was the first group discussion in the three-day
convention, which began Monday.
   More than 2,000 people, including about 1,500 publishers who
represent 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the
United States, are attending.
