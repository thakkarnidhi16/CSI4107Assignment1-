   Tonight is the night for most Americans to set
their clocks back an hour, as the nation returns to standard time.
   The change means an extra hour of sleeping time is available,
making up for the hour lost in the switch to daylight time last
spring.
   Officially, the moment comes at 2 a.m. Sunday which, by law,
becomes 1 a.m. Sunday in most of the nation.
   Some areas won't make the switch because their residents have
chosen to stay on the same time all year. Those are Arizona, Hawaii,
the part of Indiana situated in the Eastern time zone, Puerto Rico,
the Virgin Islands and American Somoa.

<HEAD>Lawn Darts Banned, ATV Rules Approved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawn darts, blamed for at least three deaths
and several thousand injuries in recent years, probably will be off
the market by Christmas.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted Friday to ban the
game, and commission officials said the restriction could be in
force as early as mid-December.
   The commission also approved safety standards for all-terrain
vehicles which extend the prohibition on sales of three-wheel
versions of those machines.
   The ban on lawn darts does not include a recall of the games
already in people's homes. That prompted Commissioner Carol Dawson
to issue a plea to parents to keep the darts out of the hands of
children.
   It was the father of a 7-year-old girl, killed by one of the
darts two years ago, who led the crusade for the ban.
   David Snow of Riverside, Calif., has testified before the
commission and Congress and worked steadily since that tragedy to
draw attention to the dangers of the large, metal or plastic darts,
used in an outdoor game similar to horseshoes.
   ``The commission today finally did what we should have done a
long time ago,'' said Commssioner Anne Graham. ``What limited
recreational value lawn darts may have is far outweighed by the
number of serious injuries and unnecessary deaths.''
   The action came as an 11-year-old Tennesee girl lay in a coma
after a lawn dart penetrated her brain. Amy Herrin was reported in
critical condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in
Nashville.
   Over the last decade as many as 6,700 injuries have been reported
involving the darts, including 150 to 200 cases in which the dart
penetrated someone's skull, the commission was told. At least three
deaths have occurred, the agency said.
   Friday's vote directed the agency staff to prepare an official
notice of the ban by Nov. 4. If the commissioners then approve the
legal language, the ban would be published in the Federal Register,
taking legal effect 30 days afterwards.
   The vote came one year and one week after the agency began
looking into the problem. Chairman Terrence M. Scanlon called this
extraordinary speed for the the agency, which took nearly five years
to issue its last product ban, a 1981 prohibition on the sale of
urea formaldehyde foam insulation.
   Last May the agency gave initial approval to banning lawn darts
capable of penetrating the skull, and on July 29 published that
proposal for public comment.
   When it came time for final action on Friday, however, the agency
expanded the scope of the ban to include all lawn darts capable of
causing any type of puncture wound _ not just those heavy enough to
penetrate the skull.
   The more extensive ban had been sought by Congress, where Sen.
Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Rep. James J. Florio, D-N.J., have pushed
the issue.
   For several years federal regulations have been in place
restricting sales of lawn darts to sporting goods stores and sports
sections of department stores in an effort to keep them away from
children.
   In many cases, however, they are sold in combination with other
games, such as volleyball and badminton, and thus can easily come
into use by children.
   Scanlon and Graham voted for the ban with Dawson abstaining until
she sees the legal notice.
   Earlier, Scanlon and Dawson joined in a 2-1 vote to approve
safety standards for all-terrain vehicles, which effectively
prohibit sales of three-wheel versions of the machines.
   Last January, the manufacturers of the machines agreed to stop
selling the three-wheel ATVs in a consent agreement that won
approval from a federal judge in the spring.
   That settlement called for the commission and manufacturers to
work out safety standards for the off-road single-rider machines
which have been blamed for nearly 1,000 deaths and hundreds of
thousands of injuries in recent years.
   The vote extends indefinitely the ban on sales of the
three-wheelers.
   In addition, the commission directed its staff to continue
working on other safety aspects of the machines, in particular
standards for stability of the four-wheel versions now being sold,
as well as safety labeling and training programs.

<HEAD>Economists Doubt That Deficit Trend Is Downward</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Economists are disputing the Reagan
administration's contention that the budget deficit's underlying
trend is downward despite a small increase for 1988.
   The Treasury Department and the White House Office of Management
and Budget reported Friday that the imbalance between revenues and
spending rose to $155.1 billion for the budget year that ended Sept.
30, a $5.4 billion increase over 1987.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a joint statement with
the OMB, pointed out that several one-time events, including the
phase-in of the new tax law, cut the 1987 deficit and inflated the
1988 budget gap.
   Excluding those special factors, the deficit would have fallen
$31.1 billion between 1987 and 1988, he said, adding, ``The
underlying trend in the deficit ... remains downward.''
   Private economists concede that 1988 represents substantial
progress compared with the record $221.1 billion shortfall of two
years ago.
   However, they see little hope for meeting the administration
projection of $145.5 billion for the current 1989 fiscal year,
absent substantial new spending cuts or a tax increase.
   The federal government spent a record $1.064 trillion during
fiscal 1988, up 6 percent from 1987. Receipts were $909 billion, up
6.4 percent.
   Interest payments on the $2.61 trillion national debt totaled
$214.1 billion, 9.6 percent greater than a year earlier.
   Analysts predict slower economic growth will cut into tax
receipts in 1989. And they expect the Federal Reserve Board, as an
inflation-fighting measure, will push interest rates higher, pushing
up government spending to finance the debt.
   The economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded
3.7 percent during the 1988 fiscal year and many analysts are
expecting the rate to slow to 2.5 percent during 1989.
   ``It's almost impossible to see how we can reduce the deficit if
we have slower growth,'' said Michael K. Evans, a consultant in
Washington. ``And the government ... is ignoring the fact that
interest has been going up steadily. ... I realize Treasury
secretaries aren't supposed to say these things, but that's
certainly the case.''
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Co., said that
if the budget deficits don't go down, the government will have
difficulty whittling away the trade imbalance and interest rates
likely will stay high to persuade foreigners to buy U.S. debt.
   ``We're close to the end of a business expansion that's run a
very long time. The problems and destabilizing effects of running
this kind of deficit may become more acute,'' Steinberg said. ``One
of the problems the next administration is going to face is that
there will be a downturn and we will not be able to loosen fiscal
policy.''
   During past recessions, the government has stepped up deficit
spending as a means of stimulating the economy.
   A bipartisan commission on the deficit has been meeting since
summer and after the Nov. 8 election will offer the new president
its recommendations. However, economists are concerned that both
candidates have left themselves little room to maneuver after taking
office.
   Republican George Bush has promised to reject the recommendation
if it includes a tax increase, and has proposed a tax cut for
capital gains. Democrat Michael Dukakis, while promising to consider
the report, so far has proposed no tax increases and few specific
spending cuts.

   The Reagan administration has rejected a rice
industry request for a federal investigation of Japanese barriers to
rice imports, averting a political storm in Japan and threatening
one in the United States.
   The decision announced Friday was something of a surprise and was
the first important test of the new, tougher 1988 Omnibus Trade Act
that was designed to help restore the competitiveness of American
goods on foreign markets.
   Disappointed U.S. rice industry officials condemned the decision
and said in a statement that it hoped the new administration to take
office in January ``will be more concerned about promoting U.S.
interests than pleasing foreign governments ...''
   Clayton Yeutter, the special trade representative, said in
announcing the decision to reject a petition of rice growers and
millers that Japan's virtual ban on imported rice was indefensible
and intolerable. He said it would be vigorously challenged, but not
in the bilateral fashion demanded by U.S. rice farmers.
   Yeutter said the administration believed it would be more
effective to pursue the complaint through the 97-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which currently is holding a
full-scale set of negotiations on global trade liberalization.
Agricultural trade is a central focus of the GATT negotiations.
   The GATT participants are scheduled to hold a review session in
December in Montreal to assess progress since the talks began in
1986 and to consider the way ahead.
   Yeutter told reporters he expects support from Japan at Montreal
on broad U.S. goals for liberalizing agricultural trade, including a
U.S. proposal to eliminate farm subsidies by the year 2000.
   ``If, on the other hand, representatives of the government of
Japan are not helpful and supportive in the agricultural discussions
in Montreal _ and if it becomes apparent that they are not committed
to solving the rice issue ... _ I am prepared to reconsider this
decision,'' Yeutter said.
   In that event, Yeutter said he would invite the U.S. rice
industry to refile its petition and he would ``make a decision on
the petition before the conclusion of the Reagan administration''
Jan. 20.
   In the background of Yeutter's decision were warnings from the
Japanese. A Japanese Cabinet official regarded as a spokesman for
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on economic issues said here last
week that turning the rice issue into an unfair trade case could
trigger political reaction at home violent enough to jeopardize
promised Japanese support of further farm trade liberalization.
   Michihiko Kunihiro, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs,
said in Washington Oct. 21 he advised U.S. officials ``the reaction
would be very violent'' to an unfair trade case on rice ``in a sort
of prosecution'' by the United States.
   ``All positive thinking of agricultural people back in Japan
(would) stop, and we will have very great difficulty in pushing
forward'' to liberalization in the Uruguay round, he said.
   Rural interests have major influence in Takeshita's
Liberal-Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for more than three
decades. In September, all parties in the lower house of parliament
joined to adopt a non-binding resolution against imports of rice,
which has near-mystical significance for the populace. But the
staple costs the Japanese six to 10 times the world price of rice
because of less-efficient domestic production on small plots in the
mountainous country.
   Backers of the Sept. 14 petition of the U.S. Rice Millers
Association and the Rice Council for Market Development, had hoped
the pressure of presidential politics would force acceptance. Two of
the richest states in electoral votes, California and Texas, are
major rice growers.
   Both the Republican presidential nominee, Vice President George
Bush, and Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis had voiced support
for the rice industry's position.
   Reagan's administration rejected a similar petition in 1986
because it wanted to give Tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban
on rice imports.
   ``We are shocked and dismayed that Ambassador Yeutter once again
would reject the U.S. rice industry's request,'' said J. Stephen
Gabbert, president of the rice millers group.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., whose district includes some of the
biggest rice farms in the nation, said the decision proved Reagan
administration officials ``are patsies when it comes to doing battle
against even blatantly illegal trade barriers.''
   Both California's senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican
Pete Wilson, expressed dismay. ``This refusal by the U.S. to take
direct action under our new, tougher trade law could well serve to
reaffirm the practice of protectionism by the Japanese and resound
negatively throughout the U.S. economy,'' said Wilson.

<HEAD>Senator Blasts Pentagon Recommendations on Base Closings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate subcommittee chairman has lambasted a
Pentagon recommendation that a special commission considering which
U.S. military bases to close not include any of the more than 1,500
overseas installations.
   ``I find it ludicrous and beyond belief that the Department of
Defense is trying to tell us ... not one could be closed,'' said
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
readiness subcommittee.
   Legislation signed by President Reagan this week authorized an
independent citizens' commission to decide which of the nation's
domestic and overseas bases are outmoded and could be closed, at a
projected annual savings of $2 billion to $5 billion.
   Dixon said Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV advised
the Armed Services Committee in a recent letter that a Pentagon
study being sent to the commission recommends that no foreign bases
be closed.
   ``If (U.S.) communities are going to be asked to undergo
significant economic and social upheaval through installation
closures and realignments, I believe they have a right to expect
that our bases overseas will receive the same scrutiny as those in
Illinois, Alaska or Michigan,'' Dixon said.
   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman declined comment, telling
reporters: ``We have sent a classified report on the subject to
Congress. But as you know, I can't discuss classified reports.''
   Dixon also contended the recommendation was the wrong message to
send U.S. allies. He said it would discourage them from shouldering
a greater portion of the cost for their own defense.

   President Reagan, saying ``there's no place
like home,'' is cranking up the nostalgia as he seeks to enlist
California and its bounty of 47 electoral votes for Republican
presidential nominee George Bush.
   ``California, here I come,'' Reagan said Thursday as he began his
last pre-election swing through his home state, where he made his
name in the movies and whose citizens twice elected him governor.
   Reagan, due to return home for good in January, is squeezing
every ounce of sentiment he can from a five-day stay here aimed at
bolstering his chosen successor's image in the Golden State.
   Before traveling north today for a two-night stop at his mountain
ranch, Reagan was scheduled to address the World Affairs Council, a
non-partisan organization formed to educate the public on world
affairs.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters heading
west with Reagan that the president was expected to touch on
U.S.-Soviet relations and the status of arms control negotiations,
and urge that Bush be elected to carry on his policies.
   The contest for the White House is close here, but Republicans
hope the Californian president will steer the state firmly into
Bush's column.
   Noting Reagan's series of stops this week in San Diego and Los
Angeles, as well as appearances next week in Fullerton and San
Bernadino, Fitzwater said, ``the president is doing everything he
can to help Bush win in California.''
   In San Diego on Thursday, Reagan told his audience of about
11,000 GOP supporters that he has ``a special place in my heart''
for Californians.
   ``You've given me so much, I hesitate to ask you anything else,''
the president said, pausing for effect. ``But will you do just one
more favor for me. Will you go out and win one for the Gipper?''
   The audience of party partisans exploded in cheers at Reagan's
use of his old nickname.
   ``As I say, there's no place like home. ... Yes, when January 20
rolls around, I'm going to be asking every one of you to open up
that Golden Gate, 'cause California, here I come,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan added that he has no doubts about passing the mantle of
the presidency to George Bush.
   ``I'll feel just fine because nobody knows better than I just how
capable and valuable are those two hands I'll be passing the torch
to,'' Reagan reassured his followers.
   The San Diego speech marked the president's second visit to his
home state since the GOP National Convention in New Orleans in
mid-August. During his previous visit in August, Reagan campaigned
in Orange County, a center of GOP conservatism south of Los Angeles.
   The president and his wife, Nancy, scheduled a weekend break at
their 688-acre ranch near Santa Barbara before Reagan resumes
campaigning.
   Fitzwater said Reagan planned to cast his absentee ballot during
the trip.
   Before he returns to Washington next Wednesday, Reagan will stump
for Bush and local GOP candidates in Reno, Nev., Milwaukee and in
another state the White House has not disclosed.

<TEXT>
   The BBC's worldwide radio service, recognized by
millions as the quintessential voice of Britain, is dropping some of
its upper-class accents and imperial signature tunes in an overhaul
of its stately image.
   Its boss is worried that ``the Beeb'' is sounding pompous and
out-of-date.
   This doesn't mean the BBC's external English-language service
plan to use announcers with broad northern England accents or
vowel-slewing Cockney tones.
   And it won't get rid of the chimes of Big Ben, the cricket scores
and the reassuring hourly announcement, ``This is London.''
   But nearly six decades after the calm, measured voice of the
British Broadcasting Corporation began beaming around the globe, its
executives have decided it risks ``verging on the pompous,'' said
John Tusa, managing director of the corporation's World Service.
   ``People kept saying `What a wonderful network,' as if that's the
end of the matter,'' Tusa said in an interview.
   ``That's exactly the time to examine it root and branch and make
sure you are improving and keeping ahead. You have to change before
the audience changes.''
   To some, the change is as inevitable as the disappearance of
Britain's bus conductors, its red pay telephone booths and its
shillings and pence. But some traditionalists are uneasy.
   ``Correct pronounciation is one of the things that have made
British broadcasting the best in the world,'' said Jocelyn Hay,
chairman of a pressure group called Voice of the Listener. ``It must
never degenerate into the slang and slovenly speech found on other
BBC (domestic) networks.''
   The overhaul, the most radical in the 57-year history of the
overseas English-language service, includes toning down the rousing,
brass-band march that for 48 years has introduced a prime news
program, ``Radio Newsreel.''
   Instead, a synthesiser-orchestrated version of ``Imperial
Echoes'' will be broadcast ahead of the program, itself restyled and
renamed ``Newsreel.''
   Elizabeth Smith, controller of the English-language service, said
critics, including some of the 60 U.S. American Public Radio
stations that relay BBC programs, found the old version ``strident
and inappropriately imperialistic.''
   ``We were brought up on this sort of tune, said Tusa, 52. ``I
thought it was just simply out of date, partly colored by the
knowledge it was called `Imperial Echoes.'''
   But he has stopped short of tampering with the BBC's famed
signature tune, ``Lilliburlero,'' the marching melody by Henry
Purcell that precedes hourly news bulletins.
   The service, taken as gospel by dozens of heads of state, is
renowned for its impartiality, and claims the world's largest
foreign audience with 25 million listeners, outstripping Voice of
America or Radio Moscow.
   Tusa, a former BBC-TV anchorman who took over the World Service
in 1986, is unmoved by the suggestion that he's meddling with an
institution.
   ``It's precisely when I hear the word institution that my hackles
rise,'' said Tusa. ``Once you're an institution you're half-way
downhill.''
   On accents, a topic which obsesses the British even more than the
weather, Tusa said: ``There's a difference between sounding
aggressively and oppressively Home Counties and just sounding more
neutral. But it will still be pretty southern standard Received
English.''
   Translated, that means replacing the clipped, slightly nasal
tones of the well-to-do in the five counties ringing London with the
accent of the educated southern English middle-classes _ who like to
think they don't have any accent.
   The 24-hour English-language service is the best-known of the
BBC's state-funded foreign broadcasts in 37 languages to an audience
of 120 million.
   The changes, which began gradually a year ago, are part of what
Tusa says is becoming less solemn and sounding more like ``today's
Britain'' for an audience that is mainly under 30, male, nearly
two-thirds in the Third World and often speaking English as a second
language.
   Other new programs are ``Newshour,'' a new nightly current
affairs program starting Monday, financial news bulletins up to 10
times a day, and ``Megamix,'' a program for young people that will
feature, among other things, heavy metal rock music.
   ``It's really communicating with young people,'' said Tusa.
``They are setting the tone.''

<TEXT>
   Secrecy is a part of life in
South Africa, extending far beyond national security to corporate
boardrooms, athletic fields, even cooking contests and a zoo
director's office.
   Because of the stigma attached abroad to dealings with South
Africa, leaders in government, business, entertainment and sports
consider clandestine tactics necessary.
   An editorial in Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper, said the
National Party government engages in ``a systematic concealment of
the truth from the public. The idea of simple public accountability
has decayed so far that not only invasions, but even the salaries of
public servants are concealed.''
   Base salaries of officials are disclosed but extensive allowances
for homes, travel, cars and other expenses are not.
   Peter Soal, a member of Parliament for the anti-apartheid
Progressive Federal Party, declared it ``impossible for the average
citizen to keep abreast of what's going on.''
   This penchant for secrets reaches high levels. Foreign Minister
Roelof F. Botha peeled off for two days during a visit to Europe
with President P.W. Botha, who is not related.
   ``I am not prepared to say publicly exactly where I was, except
to say I visited one or two countries in the East or in Africa,'' he
said after rejoining the presidential party.
   The government, controlled by the white minority, claims several
statesmen from black Africa have paid clandestine visits to South
Africa in recent years.
   Officials also say prominent blacks in South Africa have
negotiated secretly with the government about possible political
reforms, but that identifying them might discredit those leaders in
the eyes of other blacks.
   Much of the nation's foreign trade is enveloped in secrecy,
particularly when it involves efforts to circumvent economic
sanctions. The government says South Africa trades with 40 of the 50
other African countries, but refuses to name them.
   Statistics on arms imports and exports are secret, as is most
information about energy and the nuclear program..
   South Africa does not say how much oil it consumes or where it
comes from. Disclosing information on how petroleum is obtained has
been made a crime to protect those supplying oil in violation of a
U.N. embargo.
   The Defense Act prohibits unauthorized reports about the
composition and activities of the armed forces. Statistics on draft
resistance are not revealed and past incursions into Angola have
been kept secret.
   South Africa did not confirm its renewed presence in Angola last
year until many weeks after large numbers of troops crossed the
border. Military headquarters did not issue comprehensive statistics
on casualties among its black troops involved in the campaign.
   Members of Parliament have the right to ask Cabinet ministers for
information and statistics that might not be disclosed otherwise,
but ministers often refuse to respond on grounds disclosure would
not be in the national interest.
   ``That answer has become more prevalent lately,'' Soal said in an
interview. ``The Nationalists have a passion for secrecy.''
   Emergency regulations forbid unauthorized reports about detainees
or action by security forces. Justice Minister Kobie Coetzee
recently proposed restricting news reports of trials.
   Because of the extensive international sports boycott, foreign
athletes sometimes arrive using pseudonyms. Occasionally, with the
cooperation of South African media, teams compete without their
nationality or the names of the players being disclosed.
   On many occasions the locations of sports events are not
announced until foreign competitors are en route to South Africa and
thus less susceptible to last-minute political pressure.
   Even non-sports competitions can assume a cloak-and-dagger
aspect. The departure of four young South African chefs for an
international cooking contest this month was kept secret until the
eve of their departure.
   A white tiger arrived at the Pretoria Zoo in early October in a
trade with an American zoo, which received a king cheetah. Zoo
director Willie Labuschagne said the zoo in the United States asked
not to be identified.
   Foreign film crews produce movies here secretly. They like the
relatively low production costs but want to avoid international
publicity about the choice of locale.
   The Star, the largest-selling daily newspaper, recently
editorialized on the extent of secrecy and concluded: ``It will be
nice, one day, to shout from the rooftops again.''

   The ballot is so bewildering in
California this year that some officials have borrowed an idea from
the supermarket for the Nov. 8 election _ express lanes for those
who know how they are going to vote.
   Even by California standards this year's ballot is crowded,
complex and confusing.
   There are 29 statewide propositions, and some communities have
added dozens of measures and campaigns. And of course, voters also
must contend with the presidential election, a senatorial contest
and congressional races.
   In San Francisco, which this year has the longest ballot in
California and possibly the nation, the registrar of voters threw up
her hands and quit three weeks before Election Day, warning of
``electoral gridlock'' at the polls.
   In Sacramento, 41-year-old computer technician Jim Stoeckel says
he feels guilty that he's shirking his duties as a voter because
he's spent only two hours so far ``skimming'' his 160-page
California voter's ballot pamphlet.
   But Stoeckel is lucky he's a voter in Sacramento, where there are
only eight local propositions on the ballot in addition to the
near-record statewide propositions.
   If he lived in San Francisco, he'd have a second, 192-page
official voter's pamphlet with arguments and analyses on 24 local
propositions, plus a regional advisory proposition on bridge tolls
to consider _ a total of 54 ballot propositions.
   San Francisco's long ballot prompted election officials to
introduce for the first time an ``express booth'' at each polling
place for voters who have pre-marked their sample ballots. Some
small counties also are using the ``express booth.''
   Statewide, authorities have also dusted off, just in case it's
needed, a never-enforced 78-year-old state law that limits each
voter to 10 minutes in the booth.
   But officials don't want to try to enforce that, because they
don't believe that even those who know how they intend to vote on
every item can vote that quickly this year.
   ``It will still take you 10 to 15 minutes just to punch the
holes,'' said Germaine Wong, acting registrar of voters in San
Francisco.
   The statewide initiatives confronting California's 13.5 million
voters include five conflicting plans to curb skyrocketing auto
insurance rates, two AIDS measures, a proposal to raise cigarette
taxes 25 cents per pack and a measure that in effect would override
the governor's veto of a worker safety program.
   At the local level, there are hundreds more ballot propositions
covering subjects as diverse as growth control, selections of new
dump sites, rent controls and proposed new library, law enforcement
and transit taxes.
   Wong said her city's ballot is so long that for the first time
ever, it requires two computer punch cards, ``and it's complicated
because you vote differently on the two cards.''
   She said one of the cards has the names of candidates with
instructions to punch holes next to your choices, while the other
card just has numbered holes keyed to a separate voter pamphlet.
   ``San Francisco voters have seen both kinds of cards before, but
never in the same election,'' she said.
   Asked why the two cards were different, Wong replied that she
didn't know because she had just been on the job a week, replacing
Michelle Corwin, who without warning submitted a letter of
resignation Oct. 17.
   ``Her letter indicated that since she was planning to leave in
January, and because there was a lot of unpleasant work to be done
between now and then, she would just leave now and save herself the
trouble,'' said the city's astonished chief administrative officer,
Rudy Nothenberg.
   Wong said her office has received 65,000 applications for
absentee ballots, more than double the normal number among the
city's 436,000 registered voters, while registrars in other counties
reported requests for absentee ballots up by 10 percent to 75
percent.
   In nearby Alameda County, there are 27 local propositions among
its communities, but some apply to one town and not to another. San
Diego County has 37, but again, unlike San Francisco where the
county and city lines coincide, not all the propositions are on all
the ballots.
   The statewide propositions have numbers and the local ones have
letters, and Ingred Gonzalez, a San Diego County elections officer,
said this election is the first time she ever ran out of letters for
propositions.
   ``We went through the alphabet once and a second time with double
letters through up to Proposition NN,'' she said.

<HEAD>Unopposed House Members Raise $14.8 Million for Campaigns</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A watchdog group says that 59 House members
seeking re-election without major-party rivals have raised $14.8
million anyway, but lawmakers and campaign aides say they can't be
blamed for opponents who never materialized.
   ``You're never sure you're going to be unopposed,'' said George
Dalley, counsel to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who was among the
most successful fund-raisers despite having no serious opposition
for more than a decade. ``We don't take anything for granted, we
just keep running.''
   Rangel is also among 28 of the 59 unopposed lawmakers who, by
law, can keep unused campaign funds whenever they retire from
Congress. A 1974 law that barred lawmakers from keeping unspent
campaign money for personal use after leaving Capitol Hill exempted
House members elected before 1980. Rangel was elected in 1970.
   Many of the unchallenged incumbents on the list compiled by the
private group Congress Watch are House leadership figures, such as
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Reps. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.,
chairman of the Rules Committee, John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the Energy and Commerce Committee, and Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
   Forty-three of the 59 unopposed lawmakers are Democrats, who
control the House. The $14.8 million includes $7.4 million from
political action committees and a like amount from individuals.
   ``That these PACs feel compelled to contribute to lawmakers who
have no opponent shows that what's being sought is access and
influence, not compatible candidates or good government,'' said Joan
Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, the parent organization of
Congress Watch.
   PACs are formed by corporations, labor unions and other interest
groups to funnel money to candidates, with incumbents the
long-favored recipients. For the 1986 elections, according to
Federal Election Commission records, PACs sent 88 percent of their
contributions to lawmakers seeking re-election.
   Congress Watch found that from Jan. 1, 1987, through Sept. 30,
1988, 31 of the 59 incumbents with no primary or major party general
election opponents raised more than $100,000 from PACs. Of these, 12
raked in more than $200,000 and three pocketed more than $300,000.
   During the same period, 20 unopposed incumbents raised more than
$300,000 from PACs and individuals combined. Of these, 10 collected
more than $400,000 and three received more than $500,000. The
figures were compiled from Federal Election Commission data.
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, whose $524,000 in PAC and individual
contributions was tops on the list, said he had raised most of his
money last year before he knew he would be unopposed.
   Asked if compiling such a formidable campaign warchest could
serve to scare off opponents, he said, ``It hasn't in the past.''
Frost, first elected in 1978 and a member of the House Rules and
Budget committees, has always had opponents before.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, topped all PAC recipients on the list, garnering $379,842.
   The Congress Watch study said that of the 59 unchallenged
incumbents, 18 also faced no rivals in their 1986 contests and 29
others received at least 65 percent of the vote in that year's
primaries and general elections. Only six of the 59 were re-elected
in 1986 with less than 55 percent of the vote.
   The 28 lawmakers who joined Congress before 1980 and could choose
to keep their excess campaign funds are Frost, Dingell, de la Garza,
Wright, Pepper, Tom Bevill, D-Ala.; Vic Fazio, D-Calif.; Ed Roybal,
D-Calif.; Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.; Charles Bennett, D-Fla.; William
Lehman, D-Fla.; Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii; Joseph Early, D-Mass.; Ed
Markey, D-Mass.; and Joe Moakley, D-Mass.
   Also, Robert Roe, D-N.J.; James Scheuer, D-N.Y.; Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y.; Matthew McHugh, D-N.Y.; H. Martin Lancaster, D-N.C.; Wes
Watkins, D-Okla.; Bud Shuster, R-Pa.; Charles Wilson, D-Texas; Jack
Brooks, D-Texas; J.J. Pickle, D-Texas; Marvin Leath, D-Texas;
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, and Al Swift, D-Wash.

<HEAD>Three Charged In Investigation Of Day-care Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of an Akron day-care center and her
two sons were charged Thursday with a total of 11 felonies stemming
from allegations of ritualistic and sexual abuse of children in
their care, authorities said.
   The charges were filed against owner Hazel Riggs and sons Phillip
D. Schmidt, 24, and Michael A. Schmidt, about 22, following an
investigation by the state attorney general's office, said Deputy
Attorney General Greg Smith.
   Riggs and Phillip Schmidt were taken into custody in Akron
Thursday and bond was set for Riggs at $10,000 and for Phillip
Schmidt at $50,000, said Washington County Sheriff Steve Vosburg.
   Riggs met bond, but Phillip Schmidt was being held and Michael
Schmidt apparently was out of state and being sought, the sheriff
said.
   The 11 counts alleged sexual assaults on four different children
by Phillip Schmidt and Michael Schmidt, and two counts against Riggs
of being an accessory, Smith said.
   The state investigation was conducted at Gov. Roy Romer's request
after District Attorney Doyle Johns in Washington County closed the
case in July without filing charges.
   The case began when seven children under Riggs' care alleged they
were raped and sodomized by groups of adults, authorities said.
   The children, who all had been in therapy, told investigators
they were sexually abused by masked adults during what some
child-care officials believed may have been satanic rituals, The
Denver Post reported in May.
   One 4-year-old boy at that time described a ceremonial
decapitation of a young boy he called Bobby, the newspaper said.
   Two other children also described a playmate named Bobby, but
Johns said those allegations were refuted, because no body ever was
found and no Bobby ever was identified.
   Johns' year-long investigation ended July 26 when he ruled there
was no evidence to support the children's accounts. The center was
closed when Riggs relinquished her license last year.
   Parents and victims' advocates said no credible investigation was
done with some parents never being contacted and the home not being
searched for 10 months after the allegations.
   Public reaction prompted Romer to order Attorney General Duane
Woodard to investigate. Smith said Thursday he couldn't comment on
that aspect of the case, except to say ``there was substantial
additional evidence uncovered,'' during the state investigation.

<HEAD>Bush Says Dukakis Trying to Scare Voters on Trade</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with Hope event; EDITS to tighten.</NOTE>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

   George Bush accused Michael Dukakis on
Thursday of ``trying to scare the American people by putting
Japanese flags'' in his television commercials, and said the right
way to gain world markets for U.S. exports is by opening them, not
shrinking from competition.
   In a white, circus-sized tent at Applied Materials Co., in
California's Silicon Valley, the Republican presidential nominee
said he would promote U.S. trade, but not with protectionist
measures.
   ``It doesn't make sense to stick our heads in the sand, as some
in the other party have suggested, and try to build walls around
America,'' the vice president said. ``It doesn't make sense to
launch a trade war and plunge America and the world into a recession.
   ``And it is beneath the dignity of the presidency, and of the
voters, to try to incite fear of foreigners as a cheap means of
winning a few votes,'' Bush said.
   At the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, Bush and his wife,
Barbara, toured a Holocaust museum and the vice president told a
courtyard audience, ``We owe the dead and survivors alike a promise
of vigilance.''
   The Bush campaign earlier dismissed seven members of an ethnic
advisory panel who had been accused of Nazi sympathies.
   ``We have no room in our communities for hidden Nazi fugitives or
war criminals,'' Bush said at the center. ``Every last one of them
must be found and brought to justice.
   ``Bigotry is not welcome. As president I will raise my voice and
the full force of federal law when it is violated against every hate
group, desecrater and demagogue, brown-shirt, white-shirt or bowtie,
Skokie, Brooklyn, Chicago, wherever it is. The villain is the same.''
   At a reception at the estate of comedian Bob Hope, outside Los
Angeles, Bush promised ``a kinder, gentler finish for this
campaign'' after all the criticism of negative vote-hunting. But he
followed that immediately with a repeat of his attack on Dukakis for
the Massachusetts prison furlough program, saying it amounts to
telling criminals to have a nice vacation.
   The $5,000-a-couple reception outside Hope's mansion drew
Hollywood names ranging from Jane Russell to Esther Williams to
Phyllis Diller.
   ``Campaigning must be rough, flying to all those different
cities,'' Hope told his guests, who included Barbara Bush. ``These
two people have seen almost as many hotel rooms as Jimmy Swaggart.''
   ``Welcome `Orel' Bush,'' proclaimed a banner atop the podium. It
was a humorous reference to Orel Hershiser, the Los Angeles Dodgers'
pitcher who was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series.
   As he campaigned in the West, Bush repeatedly vowed opposition to
federal gun controls, drawing cheers each time. His campaign issued
copies of a 1976 statement in which Dukakis called for tight handgun
restrictions.
   Dukakis, campaigning Wednesday in Colorado, had said his position
was being misrepresented and that he always had supported ``the
right of hunters and sportsmen and of people to protect themselves
in their own homes.''
   Bush said foreign investment in the United States is not the
threat the Democrats claim.
   He also said that Dukakis should explain ``why his thinly veiled
comments about foreign investment only mention Japan,''which he said
ranks only third as a source of foreign investment in the United
States.
   ``My opponent knows better, and he should stop trying to scare
the American people by putting Japanese flags on these American
television commercials of his,'' Bush said.
   The footage of the Japanese flag appears in a Dukakis ad
challenging Bush's record as head of a commission that examined
U.S.-Japanese trade relations. The ad is running in Ohio.
   ``Bush returned from Japan saying our trade relationship was
superb,'' the ad says. ``Superb for Japan, maybe. Superb for
Japanese workers, but bad news for American working families. Mike
Dukakis stands up to foreign competition.''
   Bush said the nations of the Pacific represent ``huge and growing
markets'' for American products, ``if we don't turn and run away.''
   ``I will make sure that our trading partners continue to
understand that our markets are vital to their growth as well,''
Bush said. ``Free trade must be fair trade. A Bush administration
will keep the heat on.''
   In Tacoma, Wash., Bush accepted the endorsement of the National
Marine Engineers Beneficial Association, a seamen's union with
50,000 members. ``It will send a signal nationwide,'' the vice
president said as he received an oversized union card as an honorary
member.
   A handful of hecklers infiltrated the endorsement rally in a
Tacoma hotel exhibition hall, and at least four of them were hustled
out by police. One man had a bloody nose, another was in handcuffs.
The Bush campaign said its policy was not to oust demonstrators.
Tacoma police said two were arrested for trespassing, one of them
also charged with resisting arrest.
   The ousters caused more of a stir than the heckling had. Bush, as
usual, aimed a speech line at the dissenters: ``None of `em leaned
over and said `Please raise my taxes.''' He said Dukakis likely
would raise taxes if elected.

   The head of Parliament's investigative panel has
resigned in protest after the legislature put off a final decision
on whether two former Cabinet ministers should be tried on
corruption charges.
   Egidio Sterpa said his resignation Thursday ``speaks for itself.''
   Sterpa had bitterly criticized Parliament on Wednesday after it
overrode recommendations from his panel that Franco Nicolazzi, a
former public works minister, and Clelio Darida, a former justice
minister, be brought to trial before the Constitutional Court.
   The lawmakers, meeting in joint session, voted to send the cases
back to the commission for further investigation.
   Parliament did support a panel recommendation to drop the case
against ex-postal minister Vittorino Colombo.
   The case against the ministers involved millions of dollars in
alleged bribes paid by an architect-contractor to obtain contracts
for building prisons in the early 1980s. All three ministers denied
any wrongdoing.

   Only one woman showed up when a Playboy
magazine photographer set up shop at a gas station to interview
female Providence College students for a feature on the ``Women of
the Big East.''
   Photographer David Mecey had hoped to meet with several students
Thursday from the Roman Catholic college for the layout, scheduled
for the April 1989 issue.
   He had to move his operation from a hotel to a minivan parked at
a gas station across the street when the hotel announced he would be
allowed to sleep, but not conduct business, on the premises. College
officials also said he was not welcome on campus, and refused to
place his ad in the student newspaper.
   His assistant, Ric Moore, said he wasn't surprised by the poor
turnout.
   ``There were television cameras everywhere,'' he said, referring
to interest by local media to the magazine's controversial feature.
   Mecey originally intended to run interviews through today, but
said he may continue into the weekend because of his troubles.
   He arrived in Rhode Island almost a day late after a hotel in
Braintree, Mass., decided not to allow Playboy to stay or to
interview there when it meets with Boston College students in
mid-November, said Jeff Cohen, Playboy's managing photo editor.
   ``I thought coming to the East, people would be more liberal,''
said Lisa Martensen, Playboy's Dallas-based makeup artist.
   No nude photographs were planned during the interviews, but the
final feature will include nude and seminude pictures of about 20
women from schools in the Big East athletic conference, said Cohen.
   The women will be paid on a sliding scale depending upon their
level of undress. Mecey said most will receive $500 to $700.
   The magazine decided against seeking the cooperation of
administrators at any of Big East schools it will visit, including
the Catholic colleges of Villanova University in Villanova, Pa.,
Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., Seton Hall University in
South Orange, N.J., and St. John's University in New York.
   Officials at several of the colleges urged students not to
participate in the photo layout.

   Comedian Bob Hope opened his Toluca Lake
mansion and Republican supporters opened their wallets at $5,000 a
couple Thursday night at a star-filled San Fernando Valley
presidential rally for George Bush.
   ``I thought it would be a nice idea to have a Hollywood party for
George,'' Hope said. ``He served Ronald Reagan for eight years, and
now maybe he'd like to meet some real actors.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, seemed to enjoy the respite from the
campaign trail. They mingled with the stellar supporters with the
zest of movie fans.
   The event raised $600,000 for the Bush campaign.
   Among those present: Shirley Jones; Tom Selleck; Efrem Zimbalist
Jr.; Cyd Charisse and Tony Martin; former ambassador and actor John
Gavin and Constance Tower; Glenn Ford; Jane Russell; Robert Mitchum;
Donald O'Connor; Telly Savalas; singer Jack Jones and actress Jaclyn
Smith; Gene Autry; Wayne Rogers; Chuck Norris; Don Sutton; Don
Rickles; Jamie Farr; Danny Thomas; Mary Hart and Phyllis Diller.
   ``Welcome `Orel' Bush,'' proclaimed a banner atop the podium, in
a humorous reference to Orel Hershiser the Los Angeles Dodgers'
pitcher who was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series.
   In introducing the vice president in his spacious, chilly back
yard, Hope remarked that he ``loved the last debate. Wasn't that
something? George Bush did so much better that they were testing him
for steroids.''
   The comedian added that the Secret Service had scoured his estate
for a week before the Bush visit and their bomb-sniffing dogs
``stopped by my joke file.''
   Hope also remarked on the Bushes' strenuous campaigning.
   ``They have seen almost as many hotel rooms as Jimmy Swaggart,''
he said.
   Introduced to a standing ovation, Bush tried a few one-liners of
his own.
   ``People ask me how I feel,'' he remarked. ``And I say there are
12 days before the election and I've got Hope.''
   Bush and his wife remained long after the program, shaking hands
with celebrities and thanking them for their support.
   ``I believe in him,'' Hope said.
   ``The first time I played golf with Dwight Eisenhower, I also
played with George's father, Prescott Bush. He was a real class
gentlemen, and a lot of it rubbed off on his son.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says USDA Accounting Slip Could Hurt Grain Markets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department's inability to
account for up to $1.6 billion of commodity certificates is a ``huge
unknown'' that could seriously affect grain markets, a House
subcommittee chairman says.
   ``These certificates are just like stocks that represent millions
of dollars of U.S. grain reserves. We can't just gloss over this
problem,'' Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said Thursday.
   The certificates, which have a specific dollar value, can be
redeemed for cash, used to buy government-owned commodities, repay
government crop price support loans or resold to other individuals.
   Glickman's remarks came in response to a General Accounting
Office report that said USDA has not resolved recordkeeping
discrepancies, potentially worth $1.6 billion, for thousands of
commodity certificates issued as partial government subsidy payments
to farmers.
   The report said there are growing numbers of unreconciled
discrepancies. In some instances, there are no records of issuance
for certificates that have been reported as redeemed; in others,
redeemed certificates are recorded with a higher or lower value than
as issued.
   The agency recommended that USDA develop an immediate plan for
eliminating the problem.
   Glickman, who requested the GAO report as chairman of the
Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, said
the ``existence of the discrepancies has potentially large
implications for the markets, particularly in an environment of
increasing tightness and increased volatility.''
   That the government's commodity operation ``cannot account
accurately for such a large claim on its assets, which represent
potential grain supplies to the market, represents a disturbingly
huge unknown,'' Glickman said in a letter to Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng.
   Between 1986 and April 1988, USDA issued more than 16 million
certificates valued at $18.7 billion to farmers. About 3 million
remain outstanding, worth about $3 billion, the GAO said.
   The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which
administers farm subsidy programs, has assigned a team to correct
certificates with discrepancies and has approved a plan for reducing
the backlog. But GAO said the actions would not resolve the problem
and a backlog of 116,000 certificates would remain.

<HEAD>HUD Plans Program For `House Rich, Cash Poor'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reverse mortgage plan designed to help the
nation's ``house rich and cash poor'' would provide elderly
homeowners with up to hundreds of dollars monthly for the rest of
their lives and no need to pay it back unless they sell.
   The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance program announced
Thursday by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
initially will insure 2,500 no-payment loans to older Americans who
own homes but need cash to keep them up or lead decent lives.
   Under the demonstration program ordered in a 1987 law, the lender
takes an interest in the elderly borrower's property in exchange for
supplementing his or her income. The limited number of reverse
mortgages are to be available through banks and other lenders by
next April, HUD officials said.
   The mortgage principal, interest and insurance fees will be
collected when the house is sold or when a borrower dies, just as a
conventional mortgage would have to be settled before heirs could
take possession of a property.
   ``It will be possible for the elderly to take out a reverse
mortgage without putting out a penny,'' said Judith V. May, HUD
policy analyst who helped design the program and described it at a
briefing.
   The loans differ from regular home equity loans in that the money
does not have to be paid back during the lifetime of the borrower,
interest rates would be lower and there is no way for the borrower
to default on the loan or lose the house.
   There is a possibility that the homeowner may accumulate debts
that exceed the value of the house _ if he or she lives long enough
_ but a built-in insurance program would ensure that neither the
borrower nor heirs to the estate would have to repay the overrun.
   To qualify, a homeowner must be at least 62, own his or her home
outright or with a minimal mortgage and submit to counseling by HUD
housing experts.
   Heirs to the property would generally be included in the
counseling, said Ms. May, so they would understand the effect the
program would have on the value of the property.
   Ms. May said an elderly borrower would have the option of
receiving monthly payments for life or larger payments for a set
term or a line of credit to be drawn upon when needed.
   The older the borrower and the more valuable the house, the
bigger the payments could be.
   Maximum loans would range from $67,500 to $101,250, depending on
Federal Housing Administration maximum insurance for different parts
of the country.
   Monthly benefits on a 10 percent mortgage would range from $81
for a 62-year-old borrower in a house valued at $50,000 to $662 for
an 85-year-old in a house valued at $100,000 or more.
   A person who takes out a maximum loan on a $100,000 house at age
75 and lives to be 100 could accumulate a debt of $538,861 but would
still own the house until he or she died, and there could be no lien
against any other property even though the debt may exceed the value
of the house.
   Along with the payments, small mortgage insurance premiums would
be deducted from the home's value, so that the program could cover
any losses.
   Officials said the 2,500 loans would be available in every region
of the country, in proportion to the number of elderly homeowners in
each area.
   ``This is another option to help older people survive and thrive
in our country,'' said Carol Fraser Fisk, national commissioner on
aging.
   Representatives of the Federal National Mortgage Association,
known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known
as Freddie Mac, announced they would purchase loans under the plan.
   HUD says 73 percent of America's 18.9 million elderly own their
own homes and 83 percent of those, or 11.5 million, owe nothing on
them.
   That creates a potential reverse mortgage market of $700 billion,
said William A. Schainker, Fannie Mae senior vice president.
   The reverse mortgages will be available from regular lending
institutions but will be insured by HUD so there will be no risk of
payments being cut off or of loss to the lender, said Kenneth J.
Beirne, assistant housing secretary.
   ``Too many Americans who work most of their lives to pay off
their mortgages wake up one morning to find that they are house rich
and cash poor,'' said Rep. George C. Wortley, R-N.Y., who worked on
the legislation setting up the program.
   The project will effectively double the number of reverse
mortgages available in the United States. About 2,000 have been
issued by private lenders in seven states.
   Some adjustments could be made before final rules are adopted,
following a 60-day period for public comment, officials said.

<HEAD>Audit Shows Pentagon Overpayments To Contractors Continuing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Despite warnings five years ago, the Pentagon
has continued overpaying its contractors millions of dollars a year
because purchasing agents haven't applied official cost-control
rules, an audit shows.
   Most of that money was recovered when contracts were completed,
the internal audit report says. But at the very least, the Defense
Department still loses interest payments on the money and places an
additional financial burden on itself through premature payouts, the
Pentagon auditors concluded.
   ``During calendar years 1986 and 1987, administrative contracting
officers did not identify and collect overpayments in a timely
manner and did not assess and collect any accrued interest on these
overpayments,'' the audit says.
   At a minimum, the Pentagon overpaid contractors by some $64
million in 1986 and 1987 and then failed to recover the money on a
timely basis along with some $1.3 million in interest, the auditors
found.
   But if those results from scrutinizing 41 contracts are applied
statistically to all similar contracts, they said, the Pentagon
might have distributed close to $1 billion in overpayments in 1986
and 1987.
   ``During calendar years 1986 and 1987, we projected that DOD
administrative contracting officers did not collect $940 million of
government overpayments in a timely manner, and did not collect
accrued interest of $18.6 million on these untimely collected
overpayments,'' the audit says.
   The audit was completed last March but not released by the
Pentagon until this week. The Army, Navy and Air Force departments
accepted the findings and gave written promises of improvement.
   The study was launched as a follow-up to a 1982 audit that first
detected the problem. The armed services had promised then to take
``appropriate action to address the recommendations.''
   The latest investigation, however, found that little appeared to
have changed in the intervening five years.
   At issue is the handling of ``fixed-price, incentive-fee
contracts'' and the so-called Quarterly Limitation On Payments
statement required by such contracts.
   Under a fixed-price, incentive contract, a weapons builder
negotiates with the Defense Department a target cost, target profit
and target price before beginning work. Once deliveries begin, the
contractor must submit a statement every three months disclosing
actual cost and profit margins and billings to the Pentagon.
   If the statement shows that payments have exceeded the target
cost and profit totals, the contractor must refund the overpayment.
If the refund isn't made within 30 days, the contractor owes
interest on the overpayment.
   ``While overpayments can be accounted for and reconciled when the
contract is closed out, the government loses the time value of money
unless overpayments are detected promptly and collected in a timely
manner,'' the auditors noted.
   Using a sample of 41 contracts worth a combined $2 billion, the
inspector general discovered first that Pentagon procurement agents
were not enforcing the requirement that a quarterly statement be
submitted.
   ``For example, of the 230 (quarterly) statements required (in the
sample), 147 were either not submitted or submitted in an untimely
manner and 27 were improperly prepared,'' the audit found.
   ``Some administrative contracting officers did not request
contractors to submit quarterly statements timely and accurately,
and other administrative contracting officers did not request
accrued interest on untimely collected overpayments,'' it said.
   ``As a result, about $64 million in overpayments was not
collected in a timely manner (in the sample) and contractors owed
the government approximately $1.3 million in accrued interest on
these overpayments.''

Cold War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The serenity now shrouding East-West relations
makes it difficult to recall just how wretched things were in the
awful autumn of 1983, just five years ago.
   The same West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl who jetted off to
Moscow this week for a friendly chat with Mikhail S. Gorbachev was
busy on a less fraternal undertaking five falls ago: the
installation of U.S. nuclear weapons pointed at Soviet targets.
   Western Europe was awash in protest over the missile deployments
in five countries and the governments which backed the move were on
the defensive.
   To counter the deployments, the Soviets at one point threatened
to install their own nuclear missiles in the Caribbean, aiming them
at American targets.
   It was a time when the high hopes engendered by two sets of
nuclear arms reduction talks between the superpowers were shattered
by Soviet walkouts from both.
   South Korea was rocked by twin tragedies which occurred less than
seven weeks apart: the shooting down of KAL flight 007 by a Soviet
missile and a North Korean-inspired terrorist bombing in Burma that
killed much of the Seoul government's top leadership.
   With the downing of the KAL flight, Soviet-American relations
dropped to a low point. At a September meeting with then Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko, Secretary of State George P. Shultz refused
to discuss anything else.
   It seemed the relationship had hit bottom but with the Soviet
suspension of both arms reduction talks a few weeks later, new
depths were reached.
   It was a time when the pro-Soviet government on Grenada was
ousted by a U.S.-led invasion force, the first time any Marxist
government had ever been dislodged.
   It was a bad fall but the preceding period had set the tone. It
was a vintage year for cold warriors, the year when President Reagan
called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire'' and then, barely two
weeks later, unveiled the program which to this day remains a core
issue in Soviet-American relations _ the Strategic Defense
Initiative, ``Star Wars.''
   It was a time when the prophets of doom were in vogue but the
reality nowadays is altogether different. Since 1985, there have
been four Soviet-American summits and, even more significant, there
is less talk of nuclear war than at any time since 1945.
   The relaxation in Soviet-American tensions is such that some
analysts wonder why, in the current presidential campaign, there are
so few ideas being aired about what the new mood means and what new
policies would be appropriate to deal with it.
   Says Graham Fuller, a former senior official at the Central
Intelligence Agency, ``When you have hostile Soviet Union, it is
clear what is the basis of U.S. alliance. But what if the threat
isn't present any longer? What's the premise of U.S. alliances and
what's the role of U.S. power?''
   Fuller contends that the changes in Soviet foreign policy are
such that the next president should begin to ask: What's the problem
between us?
   Less sanguine about the more upbeat tone in Soviet-American
relations is former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who said
Wednesday that it would be a mistake for the United States to base
its foreign policy on the good will of a single individual, namely
Gorbachev.
   Look at history, Kissinger warned. At the end of every preceding
century, Russian borders have expanded in every direction. Beyond
that, he said, every Soviet Communist Party secretary general has
repudiated his predecessor, meaning that Gorbachev may be only a
transient phenomenon.
   A former Kissinger deputy at the State Department, Lawrence
Eagleburger, believes that the changes in East-West relations since
the nightmare year of 1983 signal a turning point that requires
wisdom and foresight, neither of which he says are in abundant
supply in the current campaign.
   ``What worries me is that nobody is talking about these issues,''
Eagleburger says. ``Unless we recognize the transition that's taking
place and reorganize the West to deal with it, the problems of the
next 20 years will eat us alive.''

<HEAD>Reagan Aide Paints Grim Picture Of Nicaraguan Peace Prospects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaraguan rebels are struggling in their quest
to force democratic reforms upon the Central American nation because
of erratic support from the United States, President Reagan's
national security adviser says.
   As a result, says Army Lt. Gen. Colin D. Powell, ``we face the
grim prospect of further deterioration and continuing crisis in that
country.''
   In a speech to the National Press Club Thursday, Powell said the
move toward peaceful settlements of conflicts elsewhere around the
world, including Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia, is a reflection
of ``effective resistance to aggression.''
   ``One lesson here is that sometimes leaders have the wit to see
the futility of war and to seek diplomatic solutions,'' he said. ``A
so-called `peace'' purchased at the price of surender is not real
peace, or security.''
   Powell, who succeeded Frank C. Carlucci in the national security
adviser's job when Carlucci became secretary of defense last
November, said that in Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia, ``a kind of
exhaustion has set in'' after years of brutal conflict.
   ``In all these cases of success, we also benefited from solid
bipartisan congressional support and the support of the American
people,'' he said, noting that in the case of Afghanistan, the
Mujahedeen anti-government rebels enjoyed the support of the United
States and several other countries.
   ``I believe this administration understood this lesson, and
therefore deserves some of the credit for the winding down of those
various conflicts,'' Powell said.
   Without mentioning the pitched battles the administration has had
with Congress over military assistance for the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels, he said that ``diplomacy is not going well and freedom is
not winning, precisely because effective resistance has been
undercut.''
   The administration recently abandoned hope of getting Congress to
release $16.5 million in weapons stockpiled in Honduras for use by
the Contras, indicating the problem would have to be addressed by
the next administration. The Congress did approve a $27 million
humanitarian aid package.
   Powell also said that Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev should
be given credit for attempting to bring about economic reform. But
he said it ``remains to be seen'' how much improvement can be made
under a communist, one-party system.
   Powell also said it has become clear that the Soviets have chosen
to pursue a policy of declining adventurism in foreign policy so
they can focus ``energies and resources on internal economic
reform.''
   ``The bold new leadership in the Kremlin has candidly
acknowledged the problems the Soviet system faces,'' he said. ``But
the problems are fundamental, even structural.''
   Soviet officials in Moscow on Thursday said they will begin
liquidating unprofitable businesses and farms to bolster the
nation's economy and overcome a budget deficit expected to reach $58
billion next year.
   Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet legislature
that Gorbachev's government is finding it difficult to bring deficit
spending under control.
   ``Our adversaries face a systemic crisis,'' Powell said. ``They
sense that their system is wrong but they are seeking to fix it
without changing it wholesale. It is not yet clear whether they can
succeed.
   ``The immediate problem they're facing is an economic system that
is not up to the demands of the 1990s and the 21st century,'' he
said in answer to a question from the audience.
   Powell said the Soviets will be ``left behind'' in global
economic competition ``unless they make the necessarty adjustments.''

<TEXT>
   Vitor Constancio, leader of the main
opposition Socialist Party, has resigned in a surprise move that
could delay revision of the leftist-inspired constitution.
   Constancio, 45, said Thursday that he was stepping down as
secretary general because of opposition to his leadership style.
   ``Many consider my rational, pedagogic style is holding the
Socialists back. They want more showmanship and more demagogy,''
Constancio said.
   Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said Constancio ``deserves the
greatest respect'' for contributing to stabilizing democracy in
Portugal.
   The resignation raises questions about the direction the
Socialists will take as the leading opposition party to Cavaco
Silva's center-right Social Democratic government.
   Constancio and Cavaco Silva signed an accord two weeks ago to
ensure the two-thirds majority needed to push constitutional reforms
through Parliament. But the Socialist leadership crisis could delay
debate on the changes.
   The reforms will permit the sale of many companies nationalized
after the 1974 leftist revolution. They are seen as essential for
modernization as Portugal prepares for a single European Economic
Community, or Common Market, in 1992.
   Constancio, former finance minister and governor of the Bank of
Portugal, was elected Socialist leader in June 1986 when veteran
party leader Mario Soares was elected president.
   The Socialists' vote increased in the last legislative elections
in July 1987, but the Social Democrats won a landslide victory and
formed Portugal's first majority government.
   The Social Democrats hold 148 seats to the Socialists' 60 seats
in the 250-seat Assembly of the Republic. Smaller parties and
factions hold the remaining seats.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civil rights coalition says its opponents in
the Reagan administration unwittingly served as catalysts, helping
the 100th Congress build a productive civil rights record.
   The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights lauded the 100th
Congress' record, citing legislation to strengthen the fair housing
law, restore civil rights protections invalidated by the Supreme
Court and compensate Japanese-Americans interned during World War II.
   The defeat of Robert H. Bork, a rigid conservative nominated for
the Supreme Court, also was listed as a major achievement.
   Coalition Executive Director Ralph G. Neas said Thursday that
``no previous Congress has passed so many major civil rights
statutes in such a short span.''
   Even during the heyday of the 1960s civil rights movement, Neas
said, accomplishments were spread over several sessions of Congress.
   Neas paid a backhanded tribute to former Attorney General Edwin
Meese III and William Bradford Reynolds, chief of the Justice
Department's civil rights division. The two men were architects of
the administration's civil rights policies, including opposition to
race- and sex-based quotas.
   ``Ironically, the lasting legacy of Edwin Meese and William
Bradford Reynolds may be that they served as a catalyst for the
reaffirmation of our nation's bipartisan commitment to equal
opportunity for all our citizens,'' Neas said. ``The Reagan
administration continued to compile the worst civil rights record of
any administration in several decades.''
   Neas added, ``Absent a tipping of the ideological balance of the
Supreme Court, I am confident that we will continue to move forward
with the civil rights agenda.''
   En route to Little Rock, Ark., aboard Air Force One on Thursday,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``obviously we don't
agree'' with the coalition's assessment of the administration.
   Fitzwater contended that the number of enforcement actions
against violators of the Civil Rights Act, ``whether in housing or
employment or almost any other area, are greater in this
administration than they've been in any past administration.''
   The leadership conference said 14 senators and 106 House members
supported the coalition each time they voted on a designated civil
rights issue. Three senators and 17 House members did not back the
coalition on any of the designated votes.
   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen, of Texas,
voted for the designated issues 69 percent of the time, while his
Republican vice presidential rival, Dan Quayle of Indiana, had a
rating of 15 percent.
   Neas said the four major civil rights accomplishments of the
100th Congress were:
   _Defeat of Bork, who was opposed as too rigidly conservative by
all the major civil rights organizations.
   _Enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, which gave
the nation's housing anti-discrimination law its first effective
enforcement provisions. The law also extends anti-discrimination
coverage to the disabled and families with children.
   _The override of Reagan's veto of the Civil Rights Restoration
Act, an action which restored civil rights laws that had been
invalidated by the Supreme Court. The law allows cutoff of federal
money to institutions discriminating against minorities, women,
disabled people and older Americans.
   _Passage of the Japanese-American Redress Act, which apologizes
to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II and authorizes
payments of $20,000 to survivors of the camps.
   In addition, Neas noted that Congress funded the Legal Service
Corp., which the Reagan administration has tried to put out of
business, and lawmakers reduced money for the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights, which is under control of conservative Reagan
appointees.
   Other test issues included votes on the legalization program for
illegal aliens, pay equity, disability rights, programs for
low-income children and families, and raising the minimum wage.

   An American family ritual comes around again
this weekend: the changing of the clocks.
   This is the weekend most folks get an extra hour to sleep, or
carouse, or whatever it is they like to do in the wee hours of the
morning.
   Of course, that means it's also the weekend some people get stuck
working an extra hour _ factory workers and convenience store
clerks, bartenders, police and even some news reporters.
   For most people, though, it simply means having to remember to
set the clock back _ that's right, back _ an hour before retiring
Saturday night.
   Technically, the change occurs at 2 a.m. local time, which
becomes 1 a.m., and an hour is repeated.
   Or, in the words of the Uniform Time Act which set up the system
of switching between daylight and standard times, clocks are
``retarded'' an hour at 0200 on the last Sunday in October.
   The move to standard time means that darkness will come earlier
in the evenings now, with that hour of light shifted back to the
morning hours to get the nation off to work on the right foot.
   Clocks will be ``advanced'' to daylight time next April 2,
reports the Department of Transportation, which is responsible for
keeping track of the semiannual switches.
   That's the agency in charge of the time change because the system
of uniform time zones was originally established, more than a
century ago, to simplify time keeping for the nation's railroads.
   Two other federal agencies share time keeping responsibilities
for the nation, however.
   The U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington is in charge of telling
us what time it is, at any given time.
   That's because knowing the exact time is important for navigators
trying to determine their position by looking at the stars.
   The observatory started giving the time out publicly in 1845, by
dropping a red ball from a flagstaff daily at noon. That gave
sailors something by which to set their watches.
   Today, atomic clocks keep the correct time, and callers can get
it by telephone by dialing 1-900-410-TIME. The call costs 50 cents.
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology _ formerly the
National Bureau of Standards _ is in charge of defining time.
   That is, setting a standard for the exact length of time in a
second, minute and so forth.
   While the official switch to standard time covers most of the
nation, a few states have taken matters into their own hands and
exempted themselves. Since those places didn't spring forward to
daylight time last spring, they won't fall back this weekend.
   Included in the nonconformists are Arizona, Hawaii, the part of
Indiana located in the Eastern time zone; Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands and American Samoa.

<HEAD>Former CIA Chief Says Plan To Raze Embassy Underscores Soviet
Spying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The former CIA chief who documented security
problems at the new U.S. Embassy in Moscow says President Reagan's
recommendation that the building be razed and rebuilt shows
``reality caught up with us.''
   ``The United States has tended to be complacent over the years
about Soviet technology,'' said James Schlesinger, the former
defense secretary and CIA director whom Reagan commissioned to study
the embassy. ``In this case, Soviet technology turned out to be
immensely and impressively sophisticated.''
   Reagan on Thursday said he wanted to erect a new
``American-built'' embassy in Moscow in place of the virtually
completed eight-story U.S. building because of ``the many listening
devices that were built into it.''
   A State Department source said the government had filed claims
against the Soviet Union for $29 million in connection with
``defects and delays'' in the embassy construction.
   The claims are to be negotiated by an arbitration panel in
Stockholm, Sweden.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that the
$29 million does not include possible reparations by the Soviets for
the installation of eavesdropping devices in the building or the
eventual costs to replace the building.
   ``We're talking to the Soviets now'' in an attempt to settle how
much such reparations might be, the source said.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman declined to say exactly
what devices the United States had discovered in the embassy or how
they had been installed because ``it's never in anyone's interest to
let the other guy know what you know.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from Washington, said
U.S. claims that the building is riddled with spying devices are
``groundless'' and ``obviously far-fetched.''
   Congress will be asked to approve construction of a new embassy
made by U.S. workers using American components imported under tight
security, the spokesman said.
   Redman said the price for dismantling and replacing the $190
million embassy won't be known until new plans are drawn up, but the
costs will be worth it to ensure a secure workplace for U.S.
diplomats.
   National Security Adviser Colin Powell predicted ``it will be a
very expensive proposition, a very, very difficult task to put up a
building in Moscow.''
   Schlesinger, after surveying the situation in Moscow last year,
had recommended that the three top floors of the new embassy be torn
off and that the officials try to ``neutralize'' listening devices
on lower floors. He also proposed that a new _ and secure _ annex be
built nearby where sensitive business could be conducted.
   Schlesinger said in an interview Thursday that while Reagan's
plan would be more costly, it was reasonable and showed that
``reality caught up with us.''
   ``The decision embraced the most fundamental point _ that any
area in the new office building that is to be secure must be torn
down and rebuilt,'' he added.
   Reagan's proposal had been recommended by Secretary of State
George P. Shultz following several reviews of the project by U.S.
experts and ``offers the best overall solution to the problem,''
Redman said.
   Word that the new embassy was riddled with bugs first emerged as
a hot topic in 1986 and concern heightened thereafter amid
allegations that Marines at the existing embassy in Moscow had
become involved with Soviet women and allowed Soviet agents to roam
the building.
   Many of the charges in the so-called ``sex-and-spy'' scandal
ultimately fizzled, but one Marine was convicted of espionage for
giving the KGB the identities of CIA agents and the floor plans to
U.S. embassies in Moscow and Vienna.
   Congressional and other inquiries over the past two years into
the genesis of the embassy problems turned up early warning signs
that went unheeded.
   In 1972, the United States agreed to allow a Soviet
government-owned construction firm to build the embassy. A Soviet
engineer for five months worked with the American firm that designed
the structure, and large segments were assembled out of sight of
U.S. supervisors.
   The arrangement led Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., to ask in 1987:
``Did we put in that agreement that we believed in the tooth fairy?''
   The U.S. embassy in Moscow is not the only facility in limbo
while charges of U.S.-Soviet espionage are debated _ so is the new
Soviet embassy built in Washington under the same 1972 agreement.
   The Soviets are barred from moving into the building until
Americans occupy their new embassy in Moscow. Some U.S. officials
have expressed concern that the new Soviet facility on Mount Alto,
one of the highest points in Washington, will allow the KGB to
electronically eavesdrop on sensitive conversations in government
buildings.

   Farmers made a dramatic recovery in 1987 after
years of financial torment, says a new Agriculture Department review.
   Higher incomes, lower operating costs, a 45 percent increase in
government payments and a modest rise in farm product sales
contributed to the improvement, the department's Economic Research
Service said Thursday.
   The report said net income in 1987 reached $38 billion after
adjusting for inflation, the highest level since the mid-1970s and
``was on a par with that of the 1950s and 1960s.''
   The 176-page analysis did not forecast 1988 financial returns or
assess the impact of this year's drought. However, other reports
have pointed to net cash income at or near the record 1987 level.
   But economists quickly note that thousands of farmers have been
hurt severely in 1988 by drought losses to crops and livestock while
others have prospered because of the reduced supplies and higher
prices.
   In 1987, rising land values, which represent 70 percent of all
farm assets, and lower debt boosted the equity, or net worth, of
farmers as of Jan. 1, 1988, to $571 billion from $537 billion a year
earlier, the report said. That reversed a six-year decline.
   ``The most dramatic farm financial change in the past few years
has been the improvement in the solvency position of farms,'' the
report said.
   Solvency, or the ability to pay debts, is one of the measures of
financial health in the farm sector. Others include liquidity, or
the capability of making payments when they come due, and
profitability, or net farm income.
   ``Higher net farm income in 1987 helped farmers reduce or pay off
debt and provided more farms with enough capital to avoid new debt
financing than in previous years,'' the report said. ``Asset values
rose 3 percent over those of 1986, while debt fell 8 percent to $143
billion in 1987 (the fourth annual decline in a row), leaving the
sector in the best position at any time in the 1980s to meet debt
service obligations.''
   According to the annual survey of farm costs and returns, nearly
80 percent of the nation's farms were profitable in 1987, up from 70
percent in 1986. The report said that nearly 44 percent of all farms
were free of debt at the beginning of 1988, compared with less than
39 percent a year earlier.
   There was a large variation, however, in debt owed by different
size farms. Only 16 percent of the largest _ those with sales of
more than $500,000 a year _ were free of debt at the start of this
year, compared with almost 60 percent of the smallest farms, or
those with sales of less than $10,000 annually.

   This year's drought-shriveled soybean harvest
has reduced U.S. supplies and boosted market prices, but Agriculture
Department experts say the biggest impact will be on foreign sales.
   Soybean production is estimated at about 1.5 billion bushels,
down 22 percent from last year, with the yield per harvested acre
dropping to 26.4 bushels from an average of 33.7 in 1987.
   On Sept. 1, the beginning of the new season, the U.S. soybean
stockpile was 302 million bushels, compared with 436 million a year
earlier.
   A new outlook report by the department's Economic Research
Service said Thursday that the season average price received for
soybeans in 1988-89 is expected to average $7 to $9 per bushel,
while meal prices may be in the range of $225 to $275 per ton, and
oil prices 22 cents to 27 cents per pound.
   ``Most of the adjustment to smaller soybean supplies will occur
in the export accounts,'' the report said. ``Domestic crush (for
meal and oil) will be reduced 13 percent to 1.02 billion bushels,
but soybean exports will be lowered nearly 30 percent to 565 million
bushels.''
   Soybean meal exports will decline even more sharply, by 38
percent to 4.2 million tons, the report said.
   But analysts added that domestic use of meal is forecast to drop
only 6 percent in 1988-89 because livestock and poultry inventories
are not expected to decline significantly, mainly because corn
prices have not soared as much as in other drought years.
   Soybean oil exports are expected to decline to about 1.35 billion
pounds from last year's ``unusually high'' level of 1.9 billion
pounds, the report said.

   Max Lennon, president of Clemson University,
will be honored Nov. 14 at a meeting of land-grant universities,
Agriculture Department and Cooperative Extension officials in Dallas.
   Lennon, 48, will receive the department's Seaman A. Knapp
Memorial Lecture Award for ``his outstanding career achievements,
contributions to the principles of Cooperative Extension education,
and his ability to speak to future needs of the organization.''
   Extension Service administrator Myron D. Johnsrud said Thursday
that ``in 24 years, Dr. Lennon has gone from being a young
agricultural student and crop and livestock farmer in North Carolina
to professorial and administrative posts'' at universities and in
private industry.
   Lennon was named president of Clemson in 1986. The award is named
after Seaman A. Knapp, the founder of the Cooperative Extension
Service and the county agent concept, which officially came into
being in 1914.

<HEAD>Rejection Drug May Be Cancer Fighter In Low Doses, Researchers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers studying an antibody-based drug
used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs say that it may be
a powerful cancer fighter when used in low dosages.
   In a study published today in Science, a group of researchers led
by Jeffrey Bluestone of the University of Chicago report that an
antibody called anti-CD3 triggered an immune response in laboratory
mice that was able to stop the growth of tumors.
   Bluestone said that anti-CD3, known as OKT3 in the form used on
humans, has been used in more than 15,000 patients to stop rejection
episodes following organ transplants.
   In large doses, anti-CD3 prevents T cells, a major component of
the immune system, from initiating an immune response against
foreign tissue, such as a transplanted kidney or liver.
   But in experiments in laboratory mice, Bluestone said, very small
doses of a mouse type of anti-CD3 seem to energize T cells to
initiate a strong immune response against tumors.
   ``It takes the immune system and gives it a little boost,'' he
said.
   Some tumors typically will trigger a mild immune response, but it
often is not powerful enough to stop or retard the tumor growth, he
said. By administering anti-CD3, this response is amplified.
   Bluestone and a team of researchers studied this effect by giving
laboratory mice low doses of anti-CD3 at the same time that the mice
were injected with a transplanted tumor. Other mice also were
injected with the tumor, but did not receive the anti-CD3.
   In those mice receiving the anti-CD3, 68 percent failed to
develop tumors. Mice not injected with the antibody died from the
tumors within six weeks.
   Sixty days later, the mice that received the antibody were
exposed again to the same type of tumor and Bluestone said the
cancer failed to grow, indicating that the mice had developed a
tumor-specific immunity.
   Bluestone said there have been no clinical studies testing
whether this anti-cancer effect would work on human tumors. And he
said that some cancers do not provoke an immune response and would
not benefit from anti-CD3 therapy.
   The technique is not now available for human application.
   Science, which published the report today, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. Co-authors of
the report with Bluestone were Joshua Ellenhorn and Hans Schreiber
of the University of Chicago, and Raphael Hirsch of the National
Cancer Institute.

<HEAD>Some Antibodies May Help AIDS Spread Instead Of Fighting It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some antibodies that usually fight infection
may actually assist the AIDS virus in its deadly march through the
body, a group of researchers reported today in the journal Science.
   Francis A. Ennis of the University of Massachusetts Medical
School said that in test tube studies his group found that the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS may hitch a ride on
a type of antibody in order to infect certain types of cells and
spread throughout the body.
   ``These antibodies can provide the virus a Trojan horse mechanism
whereby the virus can enter certain cells,'' said Ennis. ``It's a
mechanism by which antibodies that usually prevent a virus from
infecting the cell are actually helping the virus get into the cell
to infect.''
   Ennis said the antibody study was conducted using serum, a clear
fluid in blood, that was taken from patients who were known to have
AIDS.
   He said the serum was first diluted by a ratio of 1 part serum to
100 parts sterile water and then exposed to human cells in a test
tube. At that concentration, said Ennis, there were enough
antibodies attacking or blocking the AIDS virus to prevent it from
multiplying in new cells. Antibodies that act in this way are said
to be neutralizing antibodies.
   However, when the serum was further diluted, in ratios from
1-to-1,000 and higher, the neutralizing antibodies could no longer
control the AIDS spread. Instead, another type of antibody, called
an enhancing antibody, became dominant and the AIDS virus was able
to invade and infect new cells.
   Ennis said the pathway used to invade the cells was different
from the generally accepted infection method. A number of studies
have shown that the HIV virus enters certain cells by binding with a
protein on the cell's surface called the CD4 receptor.
   In Ennis' study, his group demonstrated that the virus can also
enter certain cells that have another type of surface protein
receptor, called the Fc.
   The study showed that the virus rides into the cells through the
Fc receptor by first attaching itself to immunoglobulin G, a large
molecule that is one of the body's main defenses against bacteria.
   Immunoglobulin G, said Ennis, is a Y-shaped molecule that carries
the Fc receptor on the main stem of the Y. He said it can join with
the AIDS virus, cradling the killer between the arms of the Y, and
then enter cells through the Fc receptor, carrying the AIDS virus in
with it.
   ``We think there is an antibody response to the virus that is
detrimental and that some of these antibodies that bind to the virus
actually help the virus infect cells,'' said Ennis. ``The patients
would be better off if they didn't have those antibodies.''
   Cells used in the study were monocytes and macrophages, which are
immunity cells that are known to be attacked by the AIDS virus in
patients who have the disease. These cells have both the Fc and the
CD4 receptors.
   More studies will be required, he said, before scientists can
determine precisely what role immunoglobulin G has in the
progression of AIDS in patients. The studies by Ennis' group were
conducted in test tubes, but the scientist said this new
understanding may have to be taken into consideration in the design
of a vaccine against AIDS.
   Dr. Robert C. Gallo, a National Institutes of Health scientist
and co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, said the finding has been
confirmed, but not published by other groups.
   ``It has implications that could be quite important,'' he said.
``It could be of clinical relevance'' because it may have to be
taken into consideration in developing drugs to fight AIDS.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that destroys the body's immune system and makes it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most
often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or
semen from infected persons.
   As of Oct. 17, AIDS had been diagnosed in 75,768 Americans of
whom 42,653 had died. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   Science, which published the study today, is the journal for the
American Association for the Advancement of Science. Coauthoring the
report with Ennis was Dr. Akira Takeda of the University of
Massachusetts Medical School.

<HEAD>FAA Orders New Rivets, Inspections to Prevent Cracks in Boeing 737s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Aviation Administration officials are
assuring the public that their new requirements for rivet
replacements and inspections on aging Boeing 737s do not mean the
passenger jets are unsafe.
   The agency on Thursday stepped up its efforts to detect existing
cracks and prevent new ones on the aircraft.
   The FAA tightened a schedule it had imposed earlier for the
replacement of 7,200 rivets on the 291 oldest 737s, including about
100 flown by American carriers. It also ordered airlines to conduct
electronic inspections of the fasteners and to fly each aircraft at
low altitudes until it has been examined.
   ``These precautions are over and above those we feel are needed
to maintain safety,'' said Anthony Broderick, the FAA's associate
administrator. ``If we had any question at all about the safety of
the planes flying tomorrow, we wouldn't let the airplanes fly.''
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble echoed Broderick's assessment,
saying, ``This isn't an emergency kind of thing.''
   There would be no massive grounding of planes under the FAA
orders. Individual 737s would be taken out of service only while
their rivets were being replaced.
   The FAA estimated it would take 2,016 hours to complete the work
on each aircraft, and would cost U.S. airlines $8 million for the
work on all 100 of their planes.
   The old 737s, built between 1967 and 1971, used a type of rivet,
since discontinued, that is now believed to cause cracks in the
fuselage skin.
   The fasteners to be replaced run along the length of the planes,
both above and below the windows.
   After the roof of an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 tore off in flight
last April 28, killing one person and injuring 61 others, the FAA
ordered rivet replacements for each 737 before it made 80,000
flights.
   The FAA on Thursday set a new schedule under which the fasteners
would have to be replaced within 36 months if a plane has flown
fewer than 40,000 times, graduating to within six months if the
craft has made 70,000 flights or more.
   The agency also ordered that all 737s with more than 40,000
landings be limited to altitudes of 26,000 feet until electronic
inspections of the rivets are made. Flying at lower altitudes limits
the amount of pressurizing and depressurizing that occurs within the
cabin, thus reducing stress on the fuselage.
   Immediately after the Aloha incident, the FAA had ordered that
737s with more than 55,000 landings be kept below altitudes of
23,000 feet. That limitation was superseded by Thursday's order.
   Last spring, the FAA ordered inspections for 737s with 30,000 or
more flights, but the examinations ordered Thursday were more
intensive.
   Concern over cracks in aging 737s have escalated in recent weeks.
Earlier this month, cracks of up to one foot in length were
discovered by chance on a Continental Airlines 737.
   The Air Transport Association says there were 570 of the 737s
used in the United States at the end of 1987, but that many were
newer models. According to Boeing, 212 of the 737s flown by 19 U.S.
airlines had taken 30,000 or more flights.
   Carriers that use 737s widely are United Airlines, Continental,
Delta Air Lines, Piedmont Airlines, USAir and Southwest Airlines.
   The new schedule for rivet replacement was technically a proposal
for which the FAA said it would accept comments from the aerospace
industry and the public until Dec. 12.
   But Broderick said, ``There isn't any question that those rivets
will be removed and replaced. The only question is the details of
the schedule.''

<HEAD>Whales' Plight Prompts Renewal of US Icebreaker Request</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For years the U.S. Coast Guard has wanted to
buy a new icebreaker, but the Reagan administration balked at
spending $300 million and just this month scrapped the proposal
again. Then came the whales. Then came the Russians.
   The use of two Soviet icebreakers in a bid to save two whales
trapped off Point Barrow, Alaska, is prompting a renewed request by
the Coast Guard to bolster the U.S. icebreaking fleet.
   The Coast Guard now has only three saltwater icebreakers and one
of them is scheduled for decommissioning in January. The service is
resubmitting its request for money to build a new one to the White
House budget office, sources said Thursday.
   The sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
White House Office of Management and Budget earlier this month
turned down the Coast Guard's proposal to include $300 million for a
new icebreaker in the administration's proposed budget for fiscal
1990.
   The Coast Guard's commandant, Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., declined to
confirm or deny that his agency was asking the White House to
reconsider, saying only that the administration has never asked
Congress for the money despite the annual pleas of his agency dating
back to President Carter's administration.
   But Yost said the trapped whales, the role of the Soviets in
saving them and the world attention focused on the Herculean effort
``have definitely been a positive impetus toward us getting a new
icebreaker.''
   ``Congress has directed that we build a new icebreaker, and now
it's just up to the Coast Guard and the administration to see if we
can fit one into the 1990 budget,'' he said.
   Congress in 1986 ordered the construction of two new icebreakers
by 1990 after a study by the administration concluded that the Coast
Guard should have a minimum of four _ and better yet five _ in its
fleet.
   But nothing has happened since then because of federal budget
deficits exceeding $150 billion each of the past three years and
bickering over whether the Coast Guard should build a new ship or
lease it from private companies as part of the administration's
``privatization'' goals.
   Over the past two years, the Coast Guard has spent $2 million
designing a new icebreaker. The agency estimates the cost of
construction at $300 million for one and $500 million for two, if
they are ordered at the same time.
   Even then, a new icebreaker will take a minimum of seven years to
build, Yost said.
   Meanwhile, Crowley Maritime Co. of San Francisco, which now
provides icebreaking services for oil companies operating on
Alaska's North Slope, has offered to build, lease and operate an
icebreaker crewed by civilians but commanded by Coast Guard officers
for $40 million a year.
   ``The Coast Guard was initially interested in our proposal two
years ago and it fit in perfectly with the administration's
privatization goals,'' said Tim Mills, a Washington attorney
retained by Crowley to push the venture. ``But then the Coast Guard
changed its mind. We've quit working on it.''
   Kurt Oxley, the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee's
counsel for Coast Guard and navigation issues, said the panel would
prefer that the Coast Guard build and staff the ship.
   But Oxley and Coast Guard officials said all sides on the issue
are rethinking their positions in light of the rescue of the two
whales.
   ``The whales trapped in the ice have raised the spectre of what's
wrong with the American icebreaking fleet, and the answer is
everything,'' Oxley said. ``With only two, we have to use them
sparingly. With four or five we could spread them out more evenly
and possibly have had one up there.''
   The United States now has three icebreakers: two 399-foot sister
ships _ the Polar Star and the Polar Sea _ built in the 1970s and
based in Seattle, and the 43-year-old Northwind based at Wilmington,
N.C. The Northwind is scheduled for decommissioning in January.
   In the 1960s, the United States had eight icebreakers, all of
World War II vintage.
   The Polar Sea is now in drydock in preparation for a resupply
mission to Antarctic in January. The Polar Star is off Nova Scotia
en route back to Seattle through the Panama Canal after it was
unable to break through the ice-clogged Beaufort Sea west of Prudhoe
Bay two weeks ago. It had to head east through the Northwest Passage
following the rescue of two ice-stuck Canadian ships.
   Yost said the United States probably would have called on the
Soviet Union's ship for help in any case, since it was only 300
miles away and had open water most of the way to where the whales
were trapped.
   ``No icebreaker _ not ours, the Russians' or the Canadians' _
could have broken through from the West or East where the Polar Star
was,'' he said. ``And our Seattle icebreaker was 3,500 miles away.''
   With one, two or even three new icebreakers, the United States
would remain well behind the Soviets, which has a fleet of 16
including four powered by nuclear reactors, according to the Coast
Guard.
   ``The Soviet Union is an Arctic nation; they need that many,''
Yost said. ``We don't need that many, we're not an Arctic nation.
But we do need at least four polar icebreakers. I think one will be
all we can afford next year. Maybe we'll get another one in the
years beyond that.''

<TEXT>
   Violent crime in New York City rose a startling
12.9 percent in the first seven months of this year, due mainly to
``an explosion in crack'' and the summer heat wave, police said.
   Murder and manslaughter was up 10.9 percent in the first seven
months of 1988 as compared to the same period in 1987, and was 27.7
percent higher this July as compared to July 1987, said Deputy Chief
Allan Hoehl of the department's Office of Management Analysis and
Planning.
   ``If murder rates keep increasing at the same pace, we'll wind up
coming close to the all-time high we hit in 1981,'' Hoehl said
Thursday. That year the city recorded 1,826 murder and manslaughter
cases.
   In the first seven months of this year 1,030 people died at the
hands of criminals. A total of 1,672 people were killed in 1987.
   In July, when temperatures soared into the 90s for days at a
time, the city averaged six murders a day. Forty murders were logged
in one weekend.
   Hoehl said there was no doubt in his mind that drug use, and
crack in particular, was the main culprit in the figures released
Wednesday at Police Headquarters.
   ``There was a lot of hot weather in July, but the main reason is
the explosion of crack,'' said Hoehl.
   Aggravated assault also was up for the first seven months of this
year, rising 12.9 percent to 41,566 over a year ago.

<HEAD>Dukakis Apparently Second-Guessing His Strategy in Waning Days of
Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a series of interviews, Democrat
Michael Dukakis has seemed to begin second guessing his own campaign
strategy even as he works to close the gap with George Bush in the
few days left to him.
   In a succession of television and newspaper interviews, the
Democratic presidential nominee acknowledged the critics may be
right when they say he squandered much of his lead in the polls by
his cautious and reluctant response to Bush's strong assaults on his
record.
   And Dukakis acknowledged he may have erred in making what was
perhaps his most memorable line of the general election campaign _
his assertion at the Democratic National Convention that this
election was about competence, not ideology.
   ``Should the speech in Atlanta have been more explicit? More of a
statement of philosophy, positions?'' Dukakis himself asked
rhetorically in an interview this week with The Washington Post.
``Perhaps,'' he concluded.
   That statement has been derided repeatedly since the July
convention by a Republican opposition that was eager to depict him
as a Massachusetts liberal out of step with the nation.
   Highlighting the ridicule was Bush's assertion in his convention
address that ``this election isn't only about competence, for
competence is a narrow ideal. Competence makes the trains run on
time but doesn't know where they're going.''
   Competence was a centerpiece of the Massachusetts governor's
rationale for seeking the presidency _ his 10 years as a chief
executive presiding over a state that has had a stunning economic
turnaround.
   But his suggestion that ideology would take a back seat to
management was an opening the Bush campaign has exploited _
apparently with success, so far _ to depict Dukakis as a Democrat
who seeks to hide his ideology to appeal to an electorate more
conservative after eight years under Ronald Reagan.
   Dukakis told the newspaper that he might better have used the
convention opportunity, when the nation was watching, to lay out
``values and philosophy ... fundamental differences between me and
George Bush.''
   Dukakis delivered what also sounded like premature post-mortums
in interviews with Dan Rather on the CBS ``Evening News'' Thursday
night, and earlier in the week in interviews with Ted Koppel on
ABC's ``Nightline'' and with Larry King on Cable News Network.
   Asked about the competence-and-ideology issue on CBS, Dukakis
said he had not gotten it backward.
   ``But I guess what I was trying to say,'' he said, ``was, it's
not a matter of ideology in terms of left or right _ it's your
philosphy of government, do you believe government should be on the
side of the average American ... doing things to make it possible
for our people to hold good jobs, educate their children, live in a
clean and wholesome environment.''
   Dukakis repeated an acknowledgement made earlier in the week when
he said perhaps he waited too long to begin forceful responses to
Bush's attack on his record on crime, the environment, patriotism
and other issues. Even running mate Lloyd Bentsen had urged him to
respond sooner, personally and in television commercials.
   ``Well, I did it, but perhaps more subtly than I should have or
than Lloyd Bentsen suggested,'' Dukakis said on CBS.
   ``Why? I guess because I'm fundamentally a positive person. I'm
not in politics and public service ... to cut up the other guy.
   ``As you know I resisted going on the attack, or the
counterattack,'' he added. ``Well, in retrospect maybe I should have
reacted more strongly.''
   He said it clearly on ABC, when Koppel asked how it was that the
Bush campaign ``has absolutely nailed your hide to the wall so far.''
   ``Perhaps I responded too late. Perhaps I should have been out
there attacking and counterattacking from the beginning,'' Dukakis
said.
   Many Democrats complain Dukakis and his campaign ignored their
pleadings to move early, in the summer, to counter Republican
criticisms that seemed to go beyond the narrow specifics and became
symbols of larger issues and even values. The Willie Horton case
became a matter of attitudes about crime and permissiveness.
   But Dukakis did respond personally and forcefully just four days
after Labor Day in a speech in East Texas, when he likened
Republican tactics to McCarthyism.
   But after one tough speech, he seemed to let it drop.
   Dukakis acknowledged on CNN ``a certain amount of frustration''
now as a result of his reluctance to respond. And he seemed to
acknowledge his campaign's difficulty in adjusting to the larger
role of becoming the party's nominee.
   ``You're suddenly in a very different world. Who says what for 45
seconds on the six o'clock news makes the difference in the
particular day, and it took us a while to understand that,'' he said.
   Francis O'Brien, a senior adviser to Dukakis, said Dukakis and
the campaign were not backing off the competence-not-ideology
statement. But he said it has conceded tactical error in the
response to Bush.
   ``That's the nature of Michael Dukakis,'' O'Brien said. ``His
nature is to be positive.''

<HEAD>Early Warnings Of Potential Security Problems Ignored</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Moscow Embassy Bjt</HEAD>

   More than 20 years ago, U.S. intelligence
agencies warned there could be security problems if Soviet workers
were allowed to help construct a new U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   Those warnings aside, a 1972 agreement was reached under which
the United States allowed a government-owned Soviet construction
firm to build the embassy.
   A Soviet engineer for five months worked with the American firm
that designed the structure, and large segments were assembled
off-site _ out of sight of U.S. supervisors.
   The arrangement led Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., to ask in 1987:
``Did we put in that agreement that we believed in the tooth fairy?''
   President Reagan announced Thursday that the virtually finished
embassy would have to be demolished because ``there's no way to rid
it of the many listenng devices.'' He said the new version would be
``American-built.''
   In an interview Thursday, James Schlesinger, the former defense
secretary and CIA chief whom Reagan commissioned to study the
problem, said the president's decision to raze the structure shows
``reality caught up with us.''
   ``The United States has tended to be complacent over the years
about Soviet technology,'' he said. ``In this case, Soviet
technology turned out to be immensely and impressively
sophisticated.''
   Schlesinger, after surveying the situation in Moscow, last year
recommended that the three top floors of the eight-story building be
torn off and that the United States try to ``neutralize'' listening
devices on the lower floors. He also proposed that a new _ and
secure _ annex be built nearby where sensitive business could be
conducted.
   Schlesinger said that while Reagan's plan would be more costly,
it was ``a reasonable decision.''
   ``The decision embraced the most fundamental point _ that any
area in the new office building that is to be secure must to torn
down and rebuilt,'' he said.
   Word that the new embassy was riddled with bugs first emerged as
a hot topic in 1986 and concern heightened thereafter amid
allegations that Marines at the existing embassy in Moscow had
become involved with Soviet women and allowed Soviet agents to roam
the building.
   Many of the charges in the so-called ``sex-and-spy'' scandal
ultimately fizzled, but one Marine was convicted of espionage for
giving the KGB the identities of CIA agents and the floor plans to
U.S. embassies in Moscow and Vienna.
   Congressional and other inquiries over the past two years into
the genesis of the embassy problems turned up early warning signs
that went unheeded.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, was among those who visited the
embassy in 1987. At a hearing last year, she read from a 1967 memo
that warned ``unless we take the most stringent precautions, we run
the risk (that the new U.S. embassy in Moscow) could be penetrated
by sophisticated listening techniques.''
   Ronald Spiers, undersecretary of state for management, said at
the hearing the 1972 construction agreement was concluded on orders
from White House officials who ``made it clear that they wanted an
agreement signed quickly,'' apparently in time for a planned visit
by then-Soviet foreign minister Andrei Gromyko.
   The Soviets have consistently denounced charges they bugged the
U.S. embassy and responded last year by displaying bugs and other
gadgets they claimed the Americans had planted in Soviet missions.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Boris Pyadyshev called it ``material
evidence of who is really intruding into the sovereign territory of
others.''
   The U.S. embassy in Moscow is not the only facility in limbo
while charges of U.S.-Soviet espionage are debated _ so is the new
Soviet embassy built in Washington under the same 1972 agreement.
   The Soviets are barred from moving into the building until
Americans occupy their new embassy in Moscow. Some U.S. officials
have expressed concern that the new Soviet facility on Mount Alto,
one of the highest points in Washington, will allow the KGB to
electronically eavesdrop on sensitive conversations in government
buildings.

<HEAD>Joffrey Ballet Dedicates Season to Founder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The New York premiere of a dance commissioned by
last winter's Olympic Games in Canada was the highlight of the
second night of the Joffrey Ballet's season at the City Center.
   ``Concerto Grosso,'' choreographed by James Kudelka to music by
Jean Papineau-Couture of Quebec, is attractive and completely
balletic, but it doesn't compete with the Olympics for excitement.
   Kudelka is resident choreographer of Les Grands Ballets
Canadiens. The Joffrey danced ``Concerto Grosso'' for the first time
last February in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
   The 25-minute ballet consists of variations on a single theme,
danced by nine couples.
   The man often lifts his ballerina, often turns her. The woman
twirls around her partner. In the second movement, they do this
slowly. Sometimes a ballerina will bend her knees and be swung, low
to the ground, around her partner, as ice skaters do. There are no
solos. Toward the end, patterns such as one in which two couples
danced in front of a center couple then danced apart to frame the
center couple were developed.
   The evening began and ended with ``The Dream'' choreographed by
Frederick Ashton and ``Arden Court'' choreographed by Paul Taylor.
   The season is dedicated to Robert Joffrey, who died in March. He
co-founded the company in 1956 with Gerald Arpino, who now is
artistic director.

   A man who just wanted a closer look at a
huge buck says he was rammed by the deer and chased up a tree before
police rescued him. Officers then shot the animal as it charged one
of them.
   ``I thought sure enough I was a goner,'' said Benjamin Kirkland,
26, of his close encounter with a 225-pound, eight-point deer.
   Kirkland, of Lufkin, Texas, said Wednesday he spent about 40
minutes in the tree before his cries for help were heard by people
who called police. He was not seriously injured.
   Kirkland said he was returning to his motel around dusk last
Friday after working on a pipeline when he saw the large buck
grazing in a field a few hundred yards behind the motel in this town
25 miles northwest of Minneapolis.
   ``Where I'm from, deer just don't get as big as that,'' he said.
   Kirkland said he crawled behind an embankment, planning to sneak
up behind the buck and get a look without being detected. But when
he reached the spot where he thought the buck would be, there was
nothing.
   He stood up to walk away, and the buck was 30 steps away, staring
at him.
   Kirkland froze. ``Generally, a buck deer like that is going to
break and run to get away from you. He's supposed to be way scareder
of you than you are of him,'' Kirkland said.
   But this deer began walking toward Kirkland, who said he thought
it must be somebody's pet. The deer came up and smelled him, then
charged, slamming its antlers into Kirkland's ribs, he said.
   The deer then slammed Kirkland into a pine tree, and he grabbed
onto the tree and scampered up it.
   ``I knew that tree was going to save me _ it was the only way
out,'' Kirkland said.
   He said he sat in the tree about 40 minutes, with the buck pacing
below and pawing the ground, before his rescue.
   Elk River patrolman Dave Sievert called in a State Patrol officer
and a reserve officer to hlp, and killed the buck when it lowered
its head and started charging them.
   Roger Holmes, chief of the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources wildlife section, said he's sure the deer was raised by
humans and released. Such deer lose their fear of humans and, when
excited, can become dangerous to people, he said.
   ``This just does not happen with a truly wild deer,'' said
Holmes. ``I have never heard of a situation where a wild buck has
... attacked a human being.''

<HEAD>Fallen Whiz Kid Tells Tale of Gangsterlike Coercion in ZZZZ Best
Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fallen whiz kid has tried to convince jurors
at his fraud trial that he was forced to commit crimes by shady
characters, including a muscular loan shark, his bodyguard and a
reputed mobster.
   In his third day on the witness stand Thursday, 22-year-old Barry
Minkow cited the late Jack Catain, a reputed underworld figure who
Minkow said helped bankroll the troubled ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning
company.
   Minkow said he met Catain in 1985 when he repaired a carpet at
Catain's home. At the time, he said, he was deeply in debt and being
pressured for money by a loan shark named Dan Krowpman and his bulky
bodyguard named Mel.
   ``Everything was terrible,'' Minkow said. ``I was bouncing
payroll checks.''
   By then, he said, he had committed credit card fraud, insurance
fraud and tax fraud on the orders of Krowpman and Mel, who
threatened him with a gun.
   Minkow, who was 16 when he started his business in his parents
garage, has portrayed himself as a youth victimized by greedy older
men. He is charged with 57 counts of securities fraud, credit card
fraud and mail fraud.
   Prosecutors have portrayed him as a shrewd con man who bilked
investors out of millions.
   Minkow, who had hired a public relations firm to promote himself,
said newspapers were writing about him as a whiz kid when he met
Catain.
   He said Catain knew about ZZZZ Best's difficulties and offered to
help.
   ``I don't know how he knew,'' said Minkow. ``But he knew I was
having financial problems.''
   After Minkow paid $2,500 in ``up-front money,'' Catain arranged
for him to receive $75,000 in loans from two small banks. He said
Catain also set him up with a new accountant who filed fictitious
income tax returns without consulting Minkow.
   Meanwhile, he said, Krowpman had a new scam, urging Minkow to get
loans from banks for carpet restoration work which was never done
and to continue committing credit card fraud to raise more funds.
   ``I didn't want to do this,'' said Minkow. ``I said, `The
business is moving well. We don't need to do this.'''
   But he was persuaded, he said, by the 6-foot-7-inch Mel.
   ``Mel pulled out a gun from under the sofa and said, `You have no
choice but to do this,''' Minkow testified.
   ``I was paranoid and I was on these steroids,'' he said. ``I was
scared.''
   Krowpman and 10 other co-defendants pleaded guilty to various
charges related to the ZZZZ Best operation. Accountant Norman
Rothberg is on trial with Minkow, accused of taking a bribe to cover
up ZZZZ Best's frauds.

   The Communist Party secretary who shocked the world
by criticizing Politburo members Andrei A. Gromyko and Mikhail S.
Solomentsev on national television says he had no idea they would be
retired three months later.
   The blunt call for resignations ``was my idea, and nobody
prompted me,'' said Vladimir I. Melnikov, a provincial party
secretary and delegate to the Supreme Soviet, the legislature, which
is meeting this week in Moscow.
   But the rotund Russian laughed during an interview Thursday and
said that when he returned home to Komi, an autonomous region in the
frozen Far North, ``everybody asked me if it was sanctioned by
somebody.''
   Melnikov became a celebrity when he suggested _ in an exchange
televised first in the Soviet Union and then on news shows worldwide
_ that aging Soviet leaders who ``actively promoted the policy of
stagnation may not serve and work on the central party and
government bodies now, at the time of perestroika. They should
answer for everything and do so personally.''
   He made the remarks June 30 at a Communist Party conference.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who spearheaded perestroika,
or restructuring of Soviet society, then asked Melnikov to be more
specific.
   ``Maybe you have some concrete suggestions?'' Gorbachev asked.
``We're sitting here and don't know: Is he talking about me, or
somebody else?''
   Melnikov replied that he was speaking about four people: the
78-year-old Gromyko, then president and previously foreign minister
for 28 years; the 74-year-old Solomentsev, then head of the Party
Control Commission; Viktor G. Afanasyev, editor of the Communist
Party newspaper Pravda; and Georgy A. Arbatov, a Soviet expert on
the United States.
   Solomentsev and Gromyko were retired in the Politburo shake-up
Sept. 30 that solidified Gorbachev's power.
   Afanasyev will be the next to go, and soon, diplomatic sources in
Moscow said on condition of anonymity. These sources said Arbatov
seems secure, so far.
   Melnikov said the fate of Afanasyev and Arbatov was a ``ticklish
question'' and left it up to the party leadership to decide.
   ``I already expressed my opinion,'' he said.
   Melnikov said he sat up late on the night before his speech
deciding what he wanted to say. For two days, he had watched an
unprecedented demonstration of glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of
openness.
   ``I decided I should reply what I think,'' Melnikov said. And he
thought that part of the blame for stagnation, the description now
given to the rule of Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev, ``should
be laid on people who were working then.''
   At the last minute, he thought it possible that Gorbachev, who
had been commenting on many of the speeches, might ask him to be
specific. So he scribbled the names of the four men on the cover of
his speech text.
   ``I think that this is a question that ripened a long time ago,''
Melnikov said. ``I expressed not only my opinion, but also that of
many delegates at the conference.''
   At home, ``the attitude toward me completely changed,'' Melnikov
said. ``Obviously, I expressed what the people thought.''

<HEAD>Despite Cuomo and More Democrats, Dukakis In Close Fight in New
York</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 3rd graf, `A Marist,' to ADD margin of error for the
polls.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis is locked in a close fight in
New York despite a hefty Democratic enrollment advantage and the
presence of popular Gov. Mario Cuomo in his corner.
   Independent polls released Thursday indicate that the Democratic
stronghold, once considered firmly in the Dukakis column, has become
a tossup with 11 days remaining until Election Day.
   A Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll had Dukakis
leading Republican presidential nominee George Bush, 47 percent to
43 percent, while a New York Post poll had Bush ahead, 46-44. The
Marist poll had a margin of error of four percentage points while
the Post survey's margin was five points.
   ``He (Bush) is ahead in New York, there's no question about that
in my mind,'' Rep. Guy Molinari, Bush's New York campaign chairman,
said Thursday.
   Al Gordon, a Cuomo political operative who is serving as Dukakis'
New York campaign director, said the race has become ``one of those
dead-even situations.''
   New York, its 36 electoral votes making it second only to
California, is considered crucial to Dukakis. Bush strategists look
upon it as potential icing on the cake.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle made one of his
rare visits to a major state with a stop in Syracuse, N.Y., Thursday
night. And with a win possible, Molinari said he's lobbying hard to
get Bush to make a swing across the state next week.
   The idea that Bush might take New York, despite a 3-2 enrollment
edge for Democrats, shouldn't come as a complete surprise. Ronald
Reagan carried the state in both 1980 and 1984.
   ``One of the misnomers is that New York is such a Democratic
state that whatever happens nationally doesn't affect it,'' said
Gordon. ``That obviously isn't true. Six out of the last 10
presidential elections (in New York) have gone to Republicans.''
   In hopes of preventing No. 7, Cuomo has been campaigning steadily
for Dukakis in recent weeks, with the New York governor spending at
least one day a week on the road for the Democratic nominee.
   Cuomo's itinerary has included California, Texas, Connecticut,
Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Earlier this week, the New York
governor traveled to Chicago and Indianapolis to talk up Dukakis.
   But top Democratic media specialist David Garth said he thinks
it's strange that the Dukakis campaign, in danger of losing New
York, hasn't asked Cuomo to make pro-Dukakis television ads that
could be used in the huge New York City media market.
   ``I have a feeling they're going through the motions more than
anything else in New York,'' complained the New York City-based
consultant to Dukakis' national campaign organization. ``Have they
asked Mario to make a spot for them? That's got to be crazy if they
didn't.''
   Gordon said that while the national campaign had been approached
about making some TV ads featuring Cuomo for use in New York, the
idea was rejected by a Dukakis headquarters that favored relying on
their national ad campaign.
   ``That's one thing they've been pretty firm on out of Boston,
that they want to keep on their pattern of commercials,'' said the
New York campaign director.
   Gordon said Dukakis' national campaign had authorized a radio ad
featuring Cuomo that will begin running in New York this weekend.
   New York's two other big-name Democrats, New York City Mayor
Edward Koch and U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, have been barely
visible on the Dukakis campaign.
   Koch, who upset many New York blacks when he said during April's
New York primary campaign that Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to
vote for Democratic candidate Jesse Jackson, was dispatched to
Florida earlier this month by the Dukakis camp to campaign for that
state's sizable Jewish vote.
   Koch proceeded to praise President Reagan as a great friend of
Israel. The mayor hasn't been back out on the Dukakis campaign trail
since.
   Moynihan, facing a nominal challenge in his bid for a third
Senate term, recently said he hadn't been doing much Dukakis
campaigning because he hadn't been asked.
   ``He will mention Dukakis in Saturday's debate. He's vowed to do
so because he's been asked about it,'' said Moynihan campaign
spokesman Lawrence O'Donnell Jr. of the senator's plans for his
final debate against Republican challenger Robert McMillan.
   In their first debate Monday night, Moynihan didn't mention
Dukakis. In an interview with the New York Post on Wednesday,
however, Moynihan did talk about Dukakis, saying that he didn't
think the Democratic nominee would win nationally and that Cuomo
would have been a better candidate.

   Masked students burned an effigy of
Uncle Sam and pelted riot police and an American bank with firebombs
and rocks in protests Thursday against the U.S. and South Korean
governments.
   Columns of students shouting ``Let's drive the Yankees out!''
streamed off campus, hurled dozens of firebombs and clashed with
riot police at universities in Seoul, Dongkuk and Konkuk, where the
effigy was burned.
   Dozens of policemen were hit with rocks or burned by exploding
firebombs.
   Earlier Thursday, about 20 students shouting ``Yankee go home!''
threw firebombs and stones at a building housing a Citibank branch
and the Koram Bank, a joint Korea-U.S. venture in southern Seoul.
Police said two students were arrested. About 10 windows were
reported broken.
   Anti-U.S. protests have been on the rise in recent weeks, fanned
by radical students demanding, among other things, the withdrawal of
the 42,000 U.S. troops stationed under a mutual defense pact.
   In the latest demonstrations, the students also demanded the
arrest of former President Chun Doo-hwan, who opponents accuse of
corruption and violation of human rights during his seven-year
tenure. Chun left office in February.
   About 300 students staged a peaceful demonstration at Seoul
National University, demanding the removal of nuclear weapons they
claim the U.S. military keeps in South Korea. They also urged the
U.S. government to repeal its agreement with South Korea that allows
the U.S. military jurisdiction over armed forces personnel and their
dependents involved in criminal proceedings.
   U.S. military authorities confirmed Thursday that tight security
measures adopted at U.S. installations during the Olympic Games that
ended Oct. 2 would continue due to ``continued unsettled
conditions.''
   Bill Fullerton, a U.S. Army spokesman, said an advisory urged
U.S. troops not to interfere in South Korean political affairs.

   Suspected Sinhaese extremists killed 10
people in central and southern Sri Lanka, and Tamil rebels fatally
shot four Moslems in the north, authorities say.
   Police imposed a daylight curfew in two industrial towns, fearing
anti-government demonstrations by opponents of the government's
peace overtures with Tamil militants, state radio said Thursday.
   The curfew was imposed in Mount Lavinia and the neighboring town
of Ratmalana, 6 miles south of Colombo.
   Police said suspected members of the People's Liberation Front, a
radical Sinhalese group, shot and a Railway Department employee
Thursday in the Colombo suburb of Dematagoda who was a government
supporter.
   Front members also have been blamed for killing nine people
Wednesday, most of them supporters of the governing United National
Party, according to a military spokesman at the Joint Operations
Command.
   The Front opposes a July 1987 peace accord aimed at ending the
5-year insurgency by Tamil rebels demanding a separate homeland in
the northeastern province. The group, which claims the accord
concedes too much to the Tamils, has been accused of killing about
500 people, most from the ruling party.
   Militant Tamils also oppose the agreement, saying it does not
meet enough of their demands.
   In Vavuniya, about 130 miles northeast of Colombo, suspected
Tamil guerrillas shot and killed four Moslems aged 19 to 28,
military officials said.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people. They claim they are oppressed by the
predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the
population.
   More than 8,500 people have died since fighting started in 1983.

   Leftist rebels attacked electric
power facilities, city buses and a bordello and killed seven people,
authorities said Thursday. A U.S. agency also was attacked and
slightly damaged.
   The offices of the U.S. Agency for International Development in
San Salvador were struck by a projectile late Thursday that cracked
several windows and caused minor damage, police guards at the site
said.
   None of the AID employees inside were hurt and no group
immediately claimed responsibility. A National Police guard outside
said he did not know what type of device had been used but described
the projectile as larger than a bullet.
   Officials with AID, the U.S. Embassy, the Defense Ministry and
National Police headquarters, consulted by The Associated Press,
said they could provide no information.
   To date, the AID offices have not suffered attacks by leftist
rebels engaged in a 9-year civil war against the U.S.-backed
government. The guerrillas have struck the American Embassy, located
in the northwest of the capital, several times without serious
incident.
   The armed forces said in addition to the seven deaths, three
people were injured in attacks this week by the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front.
   Radio Venceremos, the rebels' clandestine station whose name
means We Will Win, issued a statement in Mexico City on Thursday
claiming responsibility for the ``intensification of actions''
throughout El Salvador.
   In the most recent attack, a national guardsman was killed and a
soldier injured Thursday in the military zone around San Vicente,
about 34 miles east of the capital, an armed forces spokesman said.
   The rebels blew up four electrical towers and a gasoline station,
the spokesman said. Three electricity poles were destroyed in a
nearby town, he said.
   Police said five government soldiers and a rebel were killed in
guerrilla attacks in the capital on Wednesday.
   Three of the soldiers and the guerrilla were killed when rebels
shot at a bus guarded by soldiers. Two civilian passengers were
reported injured.
   Gunmen shot and killed the two two other soldiers as they stood
outside a movie house in the northern suburbs, police said.
   Also in San Salvador, suspected rebels on Thursday dynamited a
bordello's garage, damaging the entryway and breaking the windows of
nearby buildings, police said. No injuries or deaths were reported.
   It was the second rebel attack on a house of prostitution in the
past month. Guerrillas dynamited another such business Oct. 13.
   The rebels say they attack bordellos because they are centers of
vice and are operated by the military.
   On Tuesday, rebels assassinated the right-wing mayor of Sociedad,
a town 106 miles northeast of the capital, the government of Morazan
Department said.
   Mayor Lucio Salvador, 66, was a member of the conservative
Nationalist Republican Party, known by its Spanish acronym ARENA.
   Salvador is the third mayor the rebels have killed in a year.
   In another development, a union leader said Thursday that police
and soldiers have beat striking public works employees with rifle
butts and forcing them to work at gunpoint.
   The 20,000-member Ministry of Public Works Employees Association
went on strike Monday for higher wages.
   ``The same night, national police agents broke into workplaces in
five departments of the country, breaking chains and padlocks.
Yesterday, they beat, captured, and interrogated 15 of our
leaders,'' said union secretary-general Luis Villalta.
   Military units also occupied workplaces, he said in an interview.
He said five workers in the department of Sonsonate, 40 miles from
San Salvador, were detained for more than nine hours.
   Troops detained 10 more strikers in the department of Usulutan,
68 miles from the capital, he said.
   Villalta said the public works employees haven't had a raise in
five years.

   American movie director Martin Scorsese says he is
``saddened'' by the violent demonstrations against his film, ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' including a Paris theater fire last
weekend that left 13 people hospitalized.
   In an interview on French television Thursday night, Scorsese
called his film ``very religious'' and added, ``These acts of
violence and brutality are absolutely gratuitous.''
   Reacting to comments by Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, archbishop
of Paris, that the film was disrepectful, Scorsese said:
   ``It absolutely does not surprise me that those who have not seen
the film react like this. It is a regrettable misunderstanding.''
   French authorities charged five men for the Saturday night fire
at the St. Michel theater, one of only two Paris cinemas showing the
film.
   The fire was the most recent event in a campaign of violence
aimed at scaring spectators and driving the movie out of French
cinemas. The film, which aroused widespread controversy in the
United States, opened in 17 Paris theaters Sept. 28.
   Roman Catholic church officials condemned the weekend violence,
but advised against seeing the movie, which portrays Jesus Christ as
having human passions, including a dream sequence in which he has
sex with prostitute Mary Magdalene.

   Sportscaster Bob Costas might do well to drop
his smart-aleck style of humor, which can alienate athletes, his NBC
colleague Ahmad Rashad says in his forthcoming autobiography.
   ``It's too much like the wit you'd get from a kid who sits in the
stands making fun of the tackle who's a little too fat and slow or
of the gangly defensive back who trips over his own feet,'' Rashad,
the wide receiver-turned sportscaster, writes in the Oct. 29 issue
of TV Guide magazine.
   ``Athletes resent that kind of humor because that same wise-guy
kid wouldn't ever put himself on the line by trying to make the
team,'' Rashad said in an excerpt from his book, ``RASHAD: Vikes,
Mikes and Something on the Backside.''
   ``You can't cut a guy up with a few quips and keep the respect of
the players. You might get a laugh from your fans; you might get
every interview you want because you're a powerful media figure; but
the players secretly will lose respect for you.''

   Nelson Mandela and Anatoli Marchenko, a
Soviet dissident who died after a hunger strike, have won the
European Parliament's first Sakharov prize for freedom of thought.
   Mandela, the 70-year old South African founder of the African
National Congress who has been in jail for 25 years, was awarded the
prize for his stand against apartheid, it was announced Thursday.
   Marchenko, who spent more than 20 years in prison, was one of the
Soviet Union's best-known dissidents until his death at age 48 last
year after a hunger strike. His widow Larissa Bogoraz will receive
the prize, which he won for his book on life in Soviet prisons and
labor camps.
   Andrei Sakharov, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Soviet scientist
for whom the prize was named, was invited by the parliament to
present the awards himself in Strasbourg.
   The Sakharov prize, worth $5,750, is awarded for books or
articles on East-West relations, freedom of research, defense of
human rights and respect of international law and the constitution.

   Mikis Theodorakis, the burly composer of
``Zorba the Greek'' fame, returned home to take a break from the
music business and recover from a mild heart problem he suffered on
a foreign tour.
   Theodorakis, who returned to Greece on Wednesday, said he would
undergo tests on his heart.
   ``Examinations showed that I don't have a physical sickness but
that I'm tired. I came to the brink of a heart attack and I now feel
very tired,'' Theodorakis told reporters at Athens airport.
   The 63-year-old composer and former Communist parliamentarian
suffered a mild form of heart seizure Oct. 23 while touring Belgium.
   ``The doctors have recommended that I stop the concerts and all
other activities that may harm my health,'' Theodorakis said.
   Jailed because of his left-wing views by the military
dictatorship that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974, Theodorakis was
elected to Parliament in 1981 on the Greek Communist Party ticket

   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander
says he's unsure what tack Warner Brothers Television will take in
portraying his family's Australian adventures, described in his book
``Six Months Off.''
   But his kids suggest it would be similar to National Lampoon's
``European Vacation'' starring the bumbling Chevy Chase, Alexander
said.
   ``That movie was about a not-so-perfect family staggering along
on a European vacation,'' said Alexander, now University of
Tennessee president.
   When his second term ended in January 1987, Alexander and his
family went on a six-month sojourn in Australia.
   After his book was published, Warner Brothers bought the rights
to produce a two-hour made-for-TV movie and a comedy series,
Alexander said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Parties Raise Millions Abroad For Nov. 1 Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli parties are spending about $30 million
on the Nov. 1 election campaign, and a large chunk of that is
donated by people not even eligible to vote _ Jews who live abroad.
   The fund-raising process is shrouded in secrecy, primarily
because the law does not require public disclosure. But reports
indicate both the right-wing Likud bloc and the leftist Labor Party
have raised millions of dollars abroad.
   The U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith estimated
more than $50 million dollars may be raised by Israel's parties,
with one-third of it coming from the United States and elsewhere
overseas.
   Michal Cohen, spokeswoman of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' Labor
Party, said most of the ``big sums'' are from abroad.
   ``Most of the money is from overseas _ the United States, Canada,
France, the Jews of South Africa. The lion's share is from the
United States,'' she said without elaborating.
   A spokesman for the Likud leader, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
confirmed funds are coming from abroad even though Shamir frequently
has criticized outside Jewish groups for taking stands on divisive
political issues.
   ``That's the way it is, and both parties do it,'' said Yossi
Ahimeir, Shamir's spokesman. ``It's possible this is an issue that
should be reconsidered.''
   The Anti-Defamation League has urged Israel to amend the
elections law to require full disclosure of foreign sources of
funding.
   ``It is unhealthy to have outsiders so heavily influencing
elections in a country where they don't live,'' said Harry Wall,
head of the league's Israeli branch. ``It invites diaspora Jews into
the debate.''
   Some observers say this is only natural given Israel's
traditionally close ties with Jews overseas.
   ``Jews in America do not and should not have decision-making
powers, but it is in Israel's interest for them to be as involved as
possible and to express what kind of a Jewish state they want,''
said Emanuel Gutman, a political scientist.
   Swiss millionaire Bruce Rappoport had lunch with Peres recently,
and the independent Hadashot newspaper said he contributed $1.5
million to Labor.
   U.S. millionaire Meshulam Riklis contributed $1 million to Likud,
the newspaper said.
   The Washington Post has reported Peres raised $2 million during a
nine-day trip to the United States in June and that former U.N.
Ambassador Benjamin Netanyahu raised almost $1 million for Likud on
a similar visit.
   Labor contributors include CBS chairman Lawrence Tisch, Walt
Disney chairman Michael Eisner and Chicago businessman Philip
Klutznick, according to the Boston Globe.
   Israel's Political Financing Law provides half the campaign
funding by allocating each party $123,750 for every member of
Parliament.
   Thus, each major party receives about $5 million, a sum that may
be doubled through private fund-raising efforts.
   The law's loopholes are numerous.
   Although corporate contributions are outlawed, there is no
ceiling on individual contributions.
   Former State Comptrollers Yitzhak Tunik and Yaacov Maltz have
suggested in previous campaigns that individual contributions as
high as $500,000 may be masking business donations. They declined
comment on the current campaign.
   While U.S. laws carry both civil and criminal penalties, the only
penalty prescribed by Israeli law is to withhold 15 percent of the
government funding if one exceeds the allowed expenditures.
   U.S. law bars donations from foreign nationals and limits
individual contributions to $1,000 and donations of political action
committees to $5,000. Public disclosure is necessary.
   In Israel, only the state comptroller oversees the party's books,
and the information is never made public.
   But in an interview, former Attorney General Yitzhak Zamir said
this aspect of the law has never been put to a court test, and it is
possible a court would overturn the secrecy clause.
   One Likud member of Parliament, Michael Eitan, has proposed
amending the law to limit individual contributions to about $3,000
and said he will resubmit his proposal after the elections.
   ``It's become a scandal, a national holiday with a lot of money
being spent and a real disruption to the state,'' Eitan said.
   He called for a shorter campaigning period, with more public
debates and fewer paid advertisements.

<HEAD>FCC Eases Ownership Rule for Nearby Radio Stations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission has
decided to relax its rule on ownership of more than one radio
station.
   The new rule would allow commonly owned stations to be as close
as 25 miles apart, as long as they are in different markets.
   The rule would reduce by about half the distance required between
two stations owned by the same person or company, and it would allow
common ownership of stations in adjacent markets.
   The FCC said the new rule will enable more station owners to take
greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that
result from common ownership of stations.
   The FCC also agreed to recommend that Congress require cable
companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights
to carry their signals. The commission is expected to extend that
recommendation to cover local TV signals before it issues a final
order in the matter.

   Almost 750,000 1984-model Chevrolet, Pontiac

   A defective switch can cause excessive emissions of carbon

   Models affected are the Chevrolet Impala, Caprice Classic,
Camaro, Monte Carlo and El Camino; the Pontiac Firebird, Bonneville,
Grand Prix and Parisienne and the GMC Caballero. They are equipped

   A business executive says Robert Strauss,
co-chairman of the National Economic Commission, has said he
believes his panel will support a $120 billion deficit reduction
package split evenly between budget cuts and increased taxes.
   John Sloan, president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, said Strauss told business leaders on Wednesday that ``he
thinks he has nine votes'' on the 12-member commission for $60
billion in government spending cuts and $60 billion in tax increases
to close the budget gap.
   But James Hildreth, a spokesman for the commission, quoted
Strauss as terming Sloan's version of the meeting ``totally
inaccurate.''
   ``All he said at the dinner was that the most support he could
hope to get for any program would probably be eight or nine votes
out of the current 12 members,'' Hildreth said. ``But he denies
saying in any way, shape or form what the final package will be.''
   The commission was created by Congress to recommend how to
eliminate the federal budget deficit, which totaled an estimated
$150 billion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
   The panel has set a deadline of finishing its work by Dec. 21.

<TEXT>
   Republican policies have turned the United
States into an international debtor, dependent on foreign investors
to sustain an economy saddled with huge trade and budget deficits,
Democrat Lloyd Bentsen told a Los Angeles foreign affairs group.
   Saying the Republicans didn't recognize the threat of
international economic competition, Bentsen told the World Affairs
Council ``the United States must be able to compete not only
militarily but economically'' if it is to lead the free world and
set an example for developing nations.
   ``I would suggest that it will profit America little to gain the
whole world of military superiority if we lose the soul of our
economic capacity,'' he said Thursday. ``It will profit us little to
be military hawks if the competition is between economic eagles and
we are sitting ducks.''
   Bentsen said the Republicans were instead spending their time
distorting the Democrats' position.
   They have ``twisted the truth to imply that Gov. Dukakis is an
apostle of military weakness,'' he said. ``That's just not so.''
   Both parties planned to spend the same money on defense, he said,
but the Democrats wanted to spend more on planes, tanks and guns and
less on nuclear weapons and star wars, he said.
   Bentsen also argued that American allies should within four years
be made to pay an equal share of the costs of defending the free
world, and he said Japan should cover the $3.5 billion cost for
keeping U.S. troops there.
   While the U.S. spends more than 6 percent of its production on
the military, European nations spend far less and Japan only 1
percent, he said.
   The burden should be equalized, and he wanted to ``get that one
done in our first term,'' he said.
   Taking questions from the group afterward, Bentsen said he
supported some forgiveness of the international debt owed by Mexico
on a ``case by case basis'' and not as a nation as a whole. Mexico
needed to be treated ``like a company that went bankrupt'' that pays
part but not all on its obligations, he said.
   Both banks and the U.S. government may have to write off some of
the debt, he said. The situation with other debtor nations would
have to be reviewed individually, he said.
   Bentsen planned to continue campaigning in California this
morning and then return to his native Texas, where he will spend the
bulk of the time remaining before the election.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief Says Social Stability At Stake In Inflation
Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang has warned that
social stability and the party's ability to lead China are at stake
in efforts to control inflation.
   ``The government must see to it that inflation next year must be
conspicuously lower than this year,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency on Thursday quoted Zhao as telling the party's policy-making
Central Committee.
   ``This is the touchstone by which (we will) test the party's and
government's ability to lead and be in command of the situation,''
Zhao said in the speech.
   The speech was delivered late last month at a crucial Central
Committee meeting that decided to slash investment and spending and
roll back price reforms in order to reduce inflation. Inflation is
officially reported at 19 percent annually, but analysts believed it
to be twice that.
   Xinhua did not report the contents of the speech initially. Its
belated report may have been intended to stem speculation that Zhao
lost prestige with the Communist leadership because of his previous
support for rapid reform, and was not actively involved in setting
the new slowdown policy.
   Xinhua did not provide a text, but quoted Zhao as strongly
endorsing the measures to control inflation and overheated growth,
reassert central control over prices and distribution of key goods,
and punish widespread official corruption.
   Zhao said corruption has hurt the image of the party and
government, adding, ``If this problem remains unsolved, we'll lose
the support of the people.''
   Yearly inflation should be brought below 10 percent, as should
economic growth, he said. If this is not done, he said, ``social
stability will be affected.
   ``To us, it may appear to be late in the day to only now realize
the full extent of the problem and take action to settle it,'' Zhao
said. ``However, it is still not too late ... and even more serious
problems will follow if we continue to hesitate.''
   Since the Central Committee adopted the new anti-inflation, anti-
corruption policy Sept. 30, the government has begun cancelling
construction projects, reorganizing or shutting down companies that
made illegal business deals, and reducing local governments'
autonomy in trade and price-setting.
   Steps have been taken to discourage spending on luxuries and
tighten bank credit policies.
   Zhao said in his speech that China cannot carry out its vision of
a ``new economic system'' without price reform. But he said supplies
of staple foods and key industrial raw materials may be inadequate
for a long time and must therefore remain under central state
control to avoid pushing prices up.
   He said reforms in enterprise management should be accelerated,
however, and also called for increased efforts to privatize housing,
a major drain on municipal finances, and sell shares in state
enterprises.
   At one point, Zhao seemed to confront the possibility, feared by
some Western economists, that China's reform program will lose
momentum and become stalled indefinitely.
   ``The significance of the reform lies in what it has already
accomplished,'' he said. ``Its major importance has been in putting
an end to the closed and stagnant situation China was in when it was
begun.''

<TEXT>
   South Korea's gross national product is
expected to grow 11 percent this year, instead of the 10 percent
previously projected, the Bank of Korea reported today.
   Kim Kon of the Central Bank attributed the revised projection to
strong export earnings, high domestic demand for products and the
continued expansion in capital investment field.
   If the projection is accurate, it would be the third consecutive
year Korea has registered a double-digit growth rate. The rate was
12.3 percent in 1986 and 12 percent in 1987.
   Kim said the GNP was estimated to have grown 13 percent in the
third quarter from a year ago, and was expected to grow
substantially in the fourth quarter even if there is some slowdown
in overall business activity. The GNP grew 10.3 percent in the third
quarter of 1987.
   The GNP advanced 14.9 percent in the first quarter of this year,
but gained a lower 9.1 percent in the second quarter when many
Koreans industries were hit by labor strikes in demand of higher
wages and improved working conditions.

   Bob Hope said you never know who'll show up
when you leave the porch light on. In this case it was George Bush.
   Bush and a lawnful of Hollywood's senior celebrities.
   The vice president promised to spare them the boredom of the
issues, and reminded them about the myth of Martin Van Buren, the
last sitting vice president elected to the White House.
   It wasn't just any lawn, it was Hope's, in elegant Toluca Lake,
overlooking the private golf holes, the swimming pool and Hollywood.
   Hope spouted one-liners. Bush ventured one joke, saying the
85-year-old comedian was the only one around who could remember Van
Buren. He was elected in 1836.
   It cost $5,000 a couple to take in the Republican party at the
Hope compound Thursday night, and spend about 90 minutes with the
vice president and Mrs. Bush.
   The celebrity list included a cast of movies out of the past _
Esther Williams, Glenn Ford, Jane Russell, Robert Mitchum.
   Hope called the roll, summoning them to a stage set up behind his
vast home, and the names kept coming.
   Among them Telly Savalas, Danny Thomas, Pat Boone, Phyllis
Diller, Tony Martin, Gene Autry. ``I'll tell you,'' Hope said of the
aging Hollywood cowboy, ``if he makes it to the stage he gets
decorated.''
   With Bush and his wife at a ringside lawn table, Hope warmed up
the crowd.
   ``You leave your porch light on, you never know who's going to
show up,'' he said, looking down at the Bushes.
   ``These last few weeks they've been making more public
appearances than Elvis.''
   ``These two have seen almost as many hotel rooms as Jimmy
Swaggart.''
   Hope said he'd asked Bush over because the vice president has
been working for Ronald Reagan for eight years, ``and I thought that
now he'd like to meet some real actors.''
   But Hope said there had been inconveniences because of security.
He said the Secret Service arrived with bomb-sniffing dogs. ``They
stopped twice by my joke file.''
   Hope said that in his second presidential debate, Bush ``did so
much better than usual that they're testing him for steroids.''
   After that debate in Los Angeles, singer Barbra Streisand threw a
reception for Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   Bush's briefing paper on Thursday's campaign events said the Hope
reception would offset the Streisand affair.
   The vice president said the GOP fundraising reception was
spectacular.
   ``Bob Hope has agreed to be the head of our 51-member seniors for
Bush coalition,'' he then announced. The audience laughed.
   ``That's no joke . . . He's heading it nationwide,'' said Bush.
   ``And we picked him because, some of you may remember the myth of
Martin Van Buren, the last time a vice president was ever elected
president of the United States. And Bob was the only one who could
remember old Martin.''
   ``I'm not going to bore you with the issues and all the
campaign,'' Bush said. ``. . . When they say how do you feel I say,
look, 12 days before the election I've got Hope.''

<HEAD>Study: Payments To Air Crash Victims' Survivors Inadequate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of people killed in airline
disasters receive less than half the compensation they should, and
the legal system gives the industry little incentive to improve
safety, a Rand Corp. study concludes.
   ``Compensation in aviation cases is neither fair nor adequate,''
said economist James P. Smith, principal author of the study that
surveyed claims and lawsuits involving 2,228 deaths in 25 crashes
involving U.S. airlines between 1970 and 1984.
   ``It's not adequate in that people don't receive full
compensation for their loss. It's not fair because people with
identical losses receive very different amounts,'' he said.
   The study by Rand's Institute for Civil Justice was criticized as
misleading by trade associations for plane manufacturers and
airlines, which had paid one-third of its $1.3 million cost.
   They said the study also overstates losses to victims' survivors
and plays down how government regulation promotes safety.
   ``I don't think it's reasonable to assume that carriers are
flying aircraft they know are unsafe because they know their
(financial) exposure isn't great enough to warrant additional
care,'' said LeRoy Haugh, vice president of the Aerospace Industries
Association.
   But Bill Wagner, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America, urged state legislatures to ``look at Rand's calculations
to see if state laws should be re-evaluated to more fairly
compensate those who suffer losses.''
   The study found the most unfairly compensated survivors were
those related to crash victims who were foreigners, passengers on
bigger jets, wealthy people who would have had high future earnings,
and passengers with tickets for U.S. airlines' overseas flights or
domestic legs of overseas flights.
   The 1929 Warsaw Convention limits liabiity to $75,000 for such
``treaty tickets.''
   Rand found that in all, airlines, plane builders and government
agencies paid $769 million, compared with survivors' $1.59 billion
in true economic losses _ a projection of the amount they would have
received from the victims' future earnings.
   On average, surviving relatives of a crash victim got $363,000,
only 49 percent of the survivors' $749,000 in true economic losses.
Those losses exclude future earnings a crash victim would have spent
on himself or herself.
   Defendants pay only part of survivors' losses and never pay full
economic losses; so the legal system gives them little incentive to
improve safety, although such incentives come from government
regulation and travelers' tendencies to avoid airlines they believe
unsafe, Smith said.
   The study said that because some victims would have had very high
earnings, about half the compensation went to survivors of only
one-sixth of the victims. Survivors of the most affluent victims
tended to get a much lower percentage than survivors of the least
affluent victims relative to their monetary loss, and survivors of
professional women were undercompensated, based on the future
earnings of the ``average'' woman, the study said.
   Haugh of the Aerospace Industries Association said the study is
misleading because it lumps domestic passengers with those covered
by the $75,000 liability limit.
   ``We believe compensation in domestic accident cases has been
adequate and is in fact many times higher than anywhere else in the
world,'' said Air Transport Association spokesman Bill Jackman.
   He said compensation ``has been inadequate'' for survivors of
victims who carried treaty tickets, and airlines support efforts to
change the treaty so survivors can seek ``unlimited economic
damages.''

   Michael Dukakis has the support of more than half
the Democrats who previously voted for Ronald Reagan, but George
Bush is still ahead by nine points overall, according to an NBC
News-Wall Street Journal poll.
   The poll, released Thursday, also found many voters dissatisfied
with both major-party candidates.
   In the survey of 1,285 likely voters conducted Sunday through
Wednesday, Bush led Dukakis 51 percent to 42 percent. The lead by
the Republican vice president over Massachusetts' Democratic
governor was similar to the 52-44 margin Bush held in an
ABC-Washington Post poll conducted during the seven days ending
Tuesday.
   Those polls found a closer race than the 13- and 14-point Bush
leads among likely voters in two polls over the weekend, and
considerably closer than the 17 points in an NBC-Journal poll just
after the Oct. 13 debate.
   The survey found Bush capturing the support of more than a third
of the Democrats who voted for President Reagan in 1984, while 56
percent went for Dukakis. And the two split blue-collar voters
evenly.
   Only 35 percent in the NBC-Journal poll said they were pleased
with their choices, and 61 percent said they wished others were
running. Pollsters have said that unhappiness with the candidates
and their relatively weak support could create continuing
fluctuations in the race.
   Statewide polls in New York, meanwhile, indicate a close battle
between Bush and Dukakis in that Democratic bastion. A Missouri poll
has found a close race in that state. A Colorado poll said Bush's
lead over Dukakis has narrowed significantly, as a result of a
recent Dukakis visit.
   In New York, the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion
released a poll giving Dukakis a 47-43 lead. The survey of 654
likely New York voters had a margin of error of four points. A New
York Post survey gave Bush a 46-44 lead, but the five-point margin
of error in the survey of 677 registered voters put the two
candidates in a statistical dead heat.
   A poll in the Kansas City (Mo.) Times, showed Bush's lead over
Dukakis narrowing from nine points in a previous survey to just one
point. The survey of 550 likely Missouri voters showed Bush with 44
percent of the vote compared with 43 percent for Dukakis. The survey
had a margin of error of plus or minus four points.
   A Denver Post-NewsCenter 4 Poll showed Bush leading 50 percent to
41 percent. Dukakis had been trailing Bush by as much as 19 points.
   No margin of error was available on the survey of 450 registered
voters.

<HEAD>Many Differences Between U.S. And Soviet Space Shuttles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. space shuttle was never
equipped for an unmanned test flight like the one planned tonight
for the Soviets' look-alike orbiter. At the time, the program was
behind schedule, money was tight and the technology was not well
developed.
   NASA, however, says it had confidence that its design would work
the first time when the shuttle Columbia made its debut more than
seven years ago.
   Despite the striking resemblance of the two spacecraft, there are
numerous other differences between them.
   The Soviet shuttle's main engines will be on the Energia rocket
instead of on the reusable orbiter. The craft has small jet engines
that give it greater maneuverability for landing. And it has
liquid-fuel booster rockets instead of solid-fuel boosters like the
one that destroyed Challenger in January 1986, grounding the
American program for 32 months.
   The Soviet Union announced Wednesday that its shuttle would be
launched at 11:23 p.m. EDT today, or 6:23 a.m. Moscow time Saturday.
The shuttle is named Buran, Russian for snowstorm.
   Soviet officials said Buran's first flight would be pilotless to
avoid deaths in case of an accident like the Challenger explosion.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said its
decision to have two astronauts pilot the first U.S. shuttle
reflected engineers' confidence that it would work the first time,
but only if humans were aboard.
   Spacecraft in the earlier Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs
underwent extensive unmanned testing before men flew them.
   But the shuttle program was running three years behind schedule
and financial pressure on NASA was rising.
   Flying the shuttle without astronauts would have required
extensive and expensive changes to allow the automatic pilot to
respond to radio commands.
   Officials also noted that the American shuttle was built with the
technology of the early 1970s, when it would have been more
difficult to develop an automated landing system for so complex a
craft. The Soviets, coming along a decade later, could take
advantage of the latest developments.
   As a precaution, the U.S. shuttle included ejection seats for the
two pilots who flew early shakedown missions. But there was room for
only two such devices, and they were removed when crews expanded.
   The Soviet shuttle will be boosted into orbit by the new Energia
rocket, which can lift a 220,000-pound payload. That rivals the
power of America's huge Saturn 5 rocket, which was scrapped for
economy reasons after taking six Apollo crews to the moon.
   The liquid-hydrogen, liquid-oxygen booster has had only one test
flight, in May 1987. The Soviets called the test a success, even
though the payload failed to reach orbit. Several other technical
problems cropped up during the flight, and engineers worked for
months to correct them.
   The Soviet shuttle's main engines are attached to the Energia,
meaning they will be jettisoned and cannot be reused. On the U.S.
shuttle, the main motors are part of the orbiter and can be reflown
up to 55 times.
   By not carrying its engines, the Soviet shuttle can haul more
cargo than its U.S. cousin, about 66,000 pounds compared with 55,000
pounds. The disadvantage is that new, expensive powerplants have to
be built for each launch.
   Assisting the Soviet craft into space are four strap-on rockets,
also powered by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The U.S. vehicle
has two solid-fuel strap-on motors.
   After descending from orbit, the American shuttle becomes a
powerless glider. If it were unable to reach its runway, or if high
crosswinds or something else spoiled its final approach, the crew
would have to bail out and leave the vehicle to crash.
   The Soviet craft's two small jet engines would enable it to make
its final approach at a safer, shallower angle and allow greater
maneuverability, including the possibility of a second landing
attempt.
   NASA considered using jet engines for landing, but abandoned the
idea because of cost, weight and technical tradeoffs.

   An earthquake registering 5.0 on the Richter scale
shook the Tokyo area today but there were no immediate reports of
damage or casualties. The Central Meteorological Agency said the
tremor was minor and was unlikely to trigger a tsunami, or tidal
wave.
   The meteorological agency said the quake's epicenter was 50 miles
under the sea off Chiba, southeast of Tokyo, shaking buildings in
Chiba and Yokohama, and to a lesser extent Kofu, Utsunomiya, Choshi
and Mito in the Tokyo metropolitan area.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion is
10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 2 is the smallest normally felt by humans. A
quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated
areas, and the highest, a quake of magnitude 8, is a ``great''
earthquake, capable of tremendous damage in populated areas.

<TEXT>
   More than 2,500 University of Massachusetts
students clasped hands in a mile-long cordon against racism on the
second anniversary of a racial clash that began as a fight between
baseball fans but set off two years of unrest.
   ``I'm so proud. We did it,'' said Lori Edmonds, president of the
Afrik-Am Society, as she ran along the line of students Thursday,
hugging friends with tears streaming down her cheeks.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young praised the ``Hands Across UMass''
demonstration but said overcoming racism is not a one-day affair.
   ``This atmosphere of civility has to be more than just holding
hands with each other once a year,'' he told 600 students in an
evening speech.
   ``Ethnic insecurity is not something that you overcome just by
getting educated,'' he added, urging students to make an effort to
get to know others with different ethnic, religious and geographic
backgrounds.
   The line of students, most of them white, stretched more than a
mile diagonally across the campus in this western Massachusetts
town, from dormitories on the northwest side to dormitories on the
southwest.
   It was in the southwest sector that fights broke out between
black New York Mets fans and white Boston Red Sox boosters after the
Mets' victory in the 1986 World Series. Ten students were injured in
the fracas, which administrators blamed on underlying racial tension.
   The incident was the first of a series of campus racial clashes.
In one, students occupied a campus center for six days to draw
attention to their demand that school officials discipline five
white students accused of beating two black students.
   Chancellor Joseph Duffey said he had initially viewed Hands
Across UMass, part of a campus-wide Civility Day program, ``with
some uncertainty.''
   ``It was a bold and maybe a bit risky thing to do,'' he said.
   But the chancellor said he was pleased with the outcome. ``It was
a very moving event.''
   Music professor Horace Boyer played ``We Shall Overcome'' on the
campus carillon as the students spread out from the campus pond.
Some sang as the bright autumn sun caught the flaming maples and
oaks. But most did not know the words to the song that stirred
earlier generations of civil rights demonstrators.
   ``So many things promote separatism and ethnicity on this campus
and elsewhere that there comes a time when you need to look at the
things we have in common,'' Duffey said as he stood between a black
student and a white student.
   Jason Rabinowitz, co-president elect of the Student Government
Association, said students, both black and white, remained skeptical
about the affirmative action commitment of the 26,000-student state
university that has a 2.5 percent black enrollment.
   ``The administration made a number of promises in the wake of the
Hurst report (on the World Series fight) and the occupation of New
Africa House (a campus Third World center) last February, but they
have not followed through,'' Rabinowitz told a noontime rally.
   Students ended their occupation after administrators agreed to a
number of concessions, including increasing the number of minority
students.
   ``The programs for minority students they promised to increase
have actually been cut,'' Rabinowitz said. ``The renovations they
promised to New Africa House have not begun. And the numbers of
black students enrolled has not changed.''
   But Rabinowitz praised Civility Day.
   ``What it says about the UMass community is that our campus is
one that is overwhelmingly opposed to racism and people are willing
to come together in fighting it.''

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old girl whose forehead was
pierced by a lawn dart was in a medically induced coma today as a
federal agency prepared to ban the potentially deadly toy.
   Amy Herrin of McMinnville was in critical condition at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center as doctors waited for swelling in her
brain to subside.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission planned to ban the
manufacture and sale of lawn darts today, agency spokesman Dave
Shiflett said Thursday.
   ``I'm glad that they are going to do something, and I know they
will,'' said Amy's mother, Sue Tucker. ``It is not a toy that you
play with.
   ``What we're doing right now is hoping and praying,'' she said.
   Amy was hurt as she played the horseshoe-like game with a cousin
outside a neighbor's house in the central Tennessee city on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Tucker said the cousin raced into her kitchen, followed by
Amy, with the dart still protruding from her head.
   ``She just said, `Momma, it's in my head.' All else I remember is
me screaming,'' Mrs. Tucker said.
   A Vanderbilt surgical team spent eight hours removing the dart,
which had penetrated two inches into Amy's head. Lawn darts have
4-inch-long metal points and weigh a pound.
   Drugs were used to put the girl in a coma out of concern that if
her brain was functioning, it would swell, causing damage or death,
according to medical center spokesman Wayne Wood.
   Despite the coma, there has been some swelling in the girl's
brain, he said.
   ``Her brain sustained trauma,'' Wood said. ``What damage to her
faculties was and wasn't done, we don't know.''
   Amy faces more surgery, said her stepfather, Lamar Tucker.
   Last week, Congress passed legislation ordering the government to
ban the sale of lawn darts, which have been blamed for three
children's deaths and injuries to thousands of others.
   Federal law currently requires that the darts carry warning
labels stating the game is not for children and can cause serious
injury or death. They are not to be sold in toy stores or in toy
departments.
   ``No toy could do the damage that's been done to my baby,'' Mrs.
Tucker said.
   The cousin who threw the dart ``was real tore up,'' Mrs. Tucker
said. ``He came down (to the hospital) with his mother and dad. He's
only 11 years old. He brought (Amy) ... flowers and a big balloon.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Hawtrey, a stalwart of the ``Carry On''
comedy film series that became a British institution, has died in
southeast England. He was 73.
   Hawtrey died Thursday at the Windthorpe Lodge nursing home at the
seaside village of Walmer, 70 miles from London.
   He had been suffering from an artery problem, and the British
domestic news agency Press Association said his death came a month
after Hawtrey refused to have his legs amputated to combat it.
   Hawtrey, whose outrageously camp screen persona was once
described by a movie critic as ``a thin wet hen in granny specs,''
appeared in 23 of the 28 ``Carry On'' films.
   The series began in 1958 with ``Carry On Sergeant'' and carried
on nearly two decades at a production rate of roughly two movies a
year. The films included ``Carry On Nurse,'' ``Carry On Teacher,''
``Carry On England'' and ``Carry On Emmanuelle.''
   Spindle-legged and squawky-voiced, Hawtrey popped up in one
absurdly unlikely role after another as the series progressed.
   The formula of bawdy slapstick, old jokes, sexual innuendo and
outrageous double-entendres rarely varied but proved hugely popular
with undemanding British audiences intent on belly laughs.
   The movies are often repeated on television.
   Born George Frederick Joffre Hartree, he came from a family with
theatrical roots, although his father was a motor mechanic.
   He borrowed the name Charles Hawtrey from the celebrated
actor-manager Sir Charles Hawtrey, who died in 1923. He made his
debut on the London stage in 1927, and in 1929 began a long career
in radio comedy roles.
   Hawtrey was unmarried. Press Association said his nearest
surviving relatives, a brother Jack and sister-in-law Rose, live in
Australia.

student a rare chance to get rich quick, but a spell of honesty
stopped the man from withdrawing thousands of dollars from an
instant cash machine.
   Although Neil Martin had not applied for money machine
privileges, two new cards arrived in the mail last week. He tried
one _ inappropriately named Safecard _ and was amazed when the
screen told him $999,999.99 was in his account.
   The second card registered another $999,999.99 available for
withdrawal.
   The DeVry Institute of Technology student considered the
situation overnight, and returned to a machine Thursday morning,
where he withdrew $10 from each account. The balances did not change.
   ``Now don't make me out to be a criminal,'' Martin said. ``I just
think it's so hilarious. It's such a blunder I can't believe it
happened. I never applied for these cards.''
   Apparently, Martin was not the only Home Savings Association
customer who became an instant millionaire this week, said Jerry
Gentry, a regional vice president of the savings and loan.
   ``It's just a little fluke,'' Gentry said.
   Home Savings is merging with Safety Federal Savings and Loan
Association, and a switch to a new computer system created the crazy
account balance messages Wednesday and Thursday, Gentry said.
   The firm will investigate the glitches, he said.
   Martin tried to turn in the money Thursday, but a savings and
loan official told him his real account would reflect the
withdrawals.

   Why would somebody buy a house for nearly $1
million and then knock it down? To put up a $3.5 million house, of
course.
   ``People think we're a little crazy,'' said developer Charles
Bourque. But he said that in the case of the property overlooking
the 18th hole at the Weston Country Club, what he's doing makes good
economic sense.
   In July, Bourque and his father, Ulysse Bourque, who run Fine
Homes Inc. of Lexington, bought a large Colonial-style house on
three acres of land in this posh Boston suburb.
   Bourque said the house was in disrepair, so he razed it and is
putting up an 11-room Georgian colonial, which he plans to offer for
$3.5 million when it is completed in about five months.
   ``There has been a lot of buzzing in town and people on the golf
course are shaking their heads,'' he said. But he said the return on
the investment made the project worthwhile.

Teachers</HEAD>

   The nation's leading testing organization has
announced plans for a high-tech teacher licensing test that would
give schools a more comprehensive tool to judge the competence of
beginning teachers.
   The test, as yet unnamed, won't be available until 1992, but is
eventually expected to replace the National Teacher Exam, the
multiple-choice test currently used as a licensing tool in 30 states
and taken by some 200,000 teacher candidates a year, according to
the Educational Testing Service.
   The new test will use computer simulations of classroom
situations and other technologies expected to allow for more
thorough evaluations of beginning teaching skills than
paper-and-pencil tests, said the Lawrenceville, N.J., testing
organization.
   Teacher testing has been a thorny issue since a landmark federal
report, ``A Nation at Risk,'' charged in 1983 that ``too few
academically able students are being attracted to teaching.''
   As more states responded by turning to licensing tests to help
weed out incompetents, teacher unions objected that existing tests
do not fairly assess classroom skills, while others worried that
disproportionate numbers of minority candidates were failing them.
   ``There is a widespread and growing concern about the
preparedness and effectiveness of beginning teachers, and we believe
that breakthroughs in research and technology make possible a new
kind of assessment that will provide greater assistance, fairness
and accuracy,'' said ETS president Gregory R. Anrig on Thursday.
   ``We're trying to heed criticisms of the tests, capitalize on
advances in technology, and give a way for students to demonstrate
their strengths,'' he said.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers union, also applauded
ETS's plans. ``We are very pleased that they are calling for a
multi-faceted assessment,'' she said, adding she was pleased that
the testing firm had sought the advice of teacher unions and other
education groups.
   Carolyn Trice, associate director of educational issues for the
American Federation of Teachers, said that while the union isn't
ready to endorse the new exam, ``I'm glad to see this kind of test
development.
   ``The problem with paper-and-pencil tests is they just don't
assess what teachers know. When you get into human interaction and
how you motivate students to learn, a pencil and paper test cannot
predict whether a teacher will be successful,'' she said.
   The new exam would evaluate teacher candidates at three different
stages in their training. The first test would use a computer to
evaluate reading, math and writing skills during or after the second
year of undergraduate study. The second would assess a candidate's
grasp of subject matter and teaching principles after completion of
teacher training.
   The final test would involve classroom observation and evaluation
of teaching performance, and would make use of computer simulations
of classroom situations.
   ``The evaluation may extend over a period of time for a
prospective teacher, giving states a much better sense of
professional development,'' said Carol Dwyer, an ETS senior
development leader who created the test. ``The method also allows
the student to find out early whether he or she meets the
prerequisites needed to teach while there is still time to improve
or make other career plans.''

   World Series hero Orel Hershiser had his bags
packed and was ready to hit the talk show circuit when he realized
his wardrobe was limited to Dodger blue. The answer: a fashion
consultant, of course.
   ``It was a fashion emergency,'' said Marti Devore of the Sy
Devore clothing stores.
   After a call from the Los Angeles Dodgers' ace pitcher, Devore
enlisted an army of personal shoppers from the Best Dressed company
to go on a buying spree.
   Hershiser, who didn't take part in the buying binge, packed an
extra bag with the new clothes.
   Among his new purchases were a double-breasted gray suit and a
black herringbone jacket, she said.
   Hershiser won the first and fifth games of the 1988 World Series
as the Dodgers beat the Oakland Athletics four games to one in the
best-of-seven series. He was named the most valuable player of both
the Series and the National League Championship Playoffs.

   China, with more than 200 million smokers, will produce about 1.4
trillion cigarettes this year, more than any country in the world.
   R.J. Reynolds is a unit of RJR Nabisco Inc., which also has joint
ventures in Beijing producing Ritz and Premium crackers and a Del
Monte corn-growing and canning project near Shanghai.
   RJR Nabisco China President Jerrell K. Perry said the American
side in the cigarette project provided equipment, technology and
manufacturing expertise, while the Chinese gave land, buildings and
support facilities. Each side contributed 50 percent of the capital
investment.
   The Chinese partners are the Xiamen Cigarette Factory and the

<TEXT>
   A Soviet space shuttle that looks much like the
U.S. version is set for an unmanned test flight this weekend, a
belated Soviet acknowledgement that a shuttle is a good idea after
all.
   The shuttle named Buran, Russian for snowstorm, is scheduled for
launch at 6:23 a.m. Moscow time Saturday (11:23 p.m. EDT Friday)
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on the Central Asian steppes of
Kazakhstan.
   A Soviet TV announcer has indicated the launch time could be
pushed back because tests of systems may take longer than
anticipated. A Tass dispatch late Thursday from the launch site said
``final operations are under way.''
   For years, the Soviets wouldn't admit they were developing their
own shuttle, or ``chelnok,'' even though Western specialists date
the program back to 1982.
   In June 1980, 10 months before the United States launched the
Columbia, the chief of cosmonaut training said Soviet officials
``consider that the employment of these spacecraft is not justified
for Soviet research because present tasks can be solved with the
well-tested methods in an economical way.''
   Former cosmonaut Konstantin P. Feoktistov, writing in 1984 in a
Soviet newspaper, praised the American shuttle as ``an impressive
engineering achievement.'' But, he added, ``this system is not sound
economically and technologically.''
   Soviet officials appeared to become believers after settling on a
different focus for their shuttle than the one NASA chose.
   The U.S. shuttle was designed primarily to ferry satellites into
orbit. But Alexander I. Dunayev, the head of the Soviet space agency
Glavkosmos, said in 1987 that shuttles are not as economical as
single-use rocket boosters for placing satellites into orbit.
   In the clearest hint of the Soviet shuttle's purpose, he said
such craft are valuable for servicing space stations and satellites
and recovering objects from orbit.
   The reasoning seems sound because ever since they pioneered space
flight with the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the Soviets have forged a
proven track record for launching satellites on single-use rockets.
They put up more than 150 satellites a year, more than any other
country.
   In addition, the Soviets have concentrated on maintaining a
permanent manned presence in space aboard the orbiting space station
Mir. While Soviet officials have not said whether the shuttle is
capable of doing so, the shuttle might be able to ferry supplies and
cosmonauts to Mir.
   The Soviets have repeatedly criticized the military use of the
American shuttle, and the next U.S. flight, of the Atlantis
scheduled for late November, is a mission for the Pentagon.
   As with the American shuttle, the Soviets might use the Buran for
military missions. The U.S. Defense Department says the Soviet
shuttle could be used to deploy anti-satellite and ballistic missile
defense weapons.
   Soviet officials say the first flight of their shuttle was
designed to be pilotless to avoid danger to cosmonauts. They point
to the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the Challenger when its crew of
seven was killed as an example of the hazards they are trying to
avoid.
   It isn't clear whether the Soviets will offer the shuttle's
services to foreign customers, as they have done with their Proton
rocket boosters. If foreign customers are sought, competition will
come not only from the United States but from Western Europe.
   The Buran clearly has advantages over its American cousin. Its
separate booster rocket, the Energia, is powered only by liquid
fuels, which can be extinguished in an emergency. It has no
solid-fuel boosters like the one that failed on the Challenger.
   In addition, the Soviet shuttle can use jet engines in its tail,
giving it more maneuverability in landing than its American
counterpart, which can only glide onto a runway.
   The Buran can carry 66,000 pounds of payload, about 11,000 more
than the U.S. shuttle's payload capacity. Energia can hoist 100 tons.
   While Soviet officials maintain they did not copy the American
shuttle, the Pentagon has a different view.
   ``By using U.S. propulsion, computer, materials and airframe
technology and design, the Soviets were able to produce an orbiter
years earlier, and at far less cost, than if they had depended
solely on their own technology and engineering,'' the Defense
Department said in its 1988 report Soviet Military Power.

<HEAD>Attorney Calls Hustler Publisher's Contract Murders A Joke</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A $1 million check written by Hustler magazine
publisher Larry Flynt, purportedly for the contract murders of
singer Frank Sinatra and three publishers, was really just a
practical joke, Flynt's lawyer says.
   ``The allegations are totally unfounded,'' Flynt's attorney, Alan
Isaacman, said Thursday. ``Back in November 1983 Larry Flynt had a
dinner party and gave out, as a joke, million-dollar checks to about
half a dozen people.''
   But Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said he was taking
the matter seriously.
   ``I've been led to believe that Larry Flynt has a propensity to
try to harm people he sees as his enemies, whether (over) business
arrangements or whatever,'' Block said Wednesday.
   No charges have been filed. Sheriff's Capt. Robert Grimm said an
investigation is continuing.
   Authorities allege Flynt wrote the check on Nov. 14, 1983 to
Mitchel L. WerBell for the slaying of Sinatra, Playboy Publisher
Hugh M. Hefner, Penthouse Publisher Robert Guccione, and former TV
Guide Publisher and U.S. Ambassador Walter Annenberg.
   ``I think he was just a little crazy,'' said Guccione, who added
he does take the threat seriously. ``It was a very irrational act
because neither Hefner nor I compete with his magazine ... And if
you factor in Annenberg and Sinatra, it becomes even more
irrational. For me, I just put it down to Flynt's obvious dislike
for me.''
   Said Hefner: ``When you're a celebrity and controversial, you
wind up on one of those crazy lists with Reagan, Sinatra and the
pope.''
   Sinatra's publicist, Susan Reynolds, said the entertainer had no
comment.
   A secretary at Annenberg's Radnor, Pa., office said he was
unavailable for comment, as did a member of Annenberg's house staff
who answered the telephone at his Rancho Mirage estate. Neither
woman would give her name.
   ``This period of Flynt's life was described as a painful period
when he was using narcotics,'' Grimm said.
   Isaacman acknowledged Flynt's drug-induced behavior during the
fall of 1983, but said, ``The kinds of things he said then had
nothing to do with harming other people.''
   WerBell, head of a Georgia private security center called Sionics
Inc., was among those who received a check at the party, said
Isaacman, ``and there wasn't any talk of killing anyone. That was
someone else's idea.''
   WerBell described himself as a retired lieutenant general in the
Royal Free Afghan Army. A soldier of fortune, former international
arms dealer and one-time counterterrorism school operator, he had a
security consultant business, and Flynt was one of his clients.
   ``We never heard anything about this check being paid to kill
anybody until (Wednesday) afternoon,'' Isaacman said.
   He said none of the guests tried to cash their checks, including
WerBell. He said it was found by WerBell's sons after his death in
December 1983, and they tried to cash it in February 1984. It had
been canceled by then.
   The sons sued Flynt in a Georgia court to get the money, and
Isaacman said the case was thrown out. The check was preserved as
part of the court record, he said.
   Grimm said information about the alleged plot turned up recently
in the investigation of the 1983 murder-for-hire slaying of New York
theater producer Roy Radin, whom authorities said was embroiled in a
soured finance deal for the movie ``The Cotton Club.''

<HEAD>Television Satellite Takes Flight On Ariane Rocket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOUROU, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The launch of an Ariane 2 rocket was
judged a success as it lifted into orbit a powerful television
satellite that heralds a new era of French broadcasting.
   The satellite lifted off without a hitch into clear skies late
Thursday above the European Space Agency launch site on the
northeastern edge of South America.
   It was the 13th successful launch in 13 months for Arianespace,
responsible for the European Space Agency's commercial launches.
   The satellite reached orbit about 16 minutes after takeoff and
quickly separated from the rocket.
   About 25 minutes after liftoff, the solar panels opened on the
satellite. It was the stage that had most concerned technicians
after the failure last year of the West German TV-SAT1 satellite.
   For a reason that has yet to be determined, the panels failed to
open on the West German satellite, a sister to the French satellite
under the joint French-German agreement that was the origin of the
satellite project in 1977.
   Officials at the space center described the launch as ``a
complete success.''
   The five-channel French satellite will beam television shows
directly to the home. Previously, satellite signals were picked up
by large dishes owned by cable companies and networks that relayed
programming to viewers.
   The satellite, which will be operational by late December, has a
lifespan of eight years and will sit in geostationary orbit 22,000
miles above the Atlantic Ocean.
   Its signal will reach viewers from Portugal to the Ural Mountains
of the Soviet Union and from Britain to North Africa, bringing
viewers with receiving equipment a better TV picture and stereo
sound. TDF1 is the first step for Europe toward the new technology
of high-definition television.
   It was designed by the French broadcasting authority to bring an
increased number of television channels to 66 million
French-speaking viewers in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg,
Monaco and a potential audience of 400 million viewers in North
Africa.
   Simone Veil, a member of the European Parliament and president of
the European Year of Cinema and Television, called the launch a
``formidable success.''
   In a message to the head of France's broadcasting authority, Mrs.
Veil said the satellite ``turns a new page in the history of
television in Europe.''
   Critics have said the satellite, developed over a decade at a
cost of about $250 million, is overpriced and already outmoded.
   Since the satellite was designed, advances in technology have put
it at a competitive disadvantage against five other satellite
ventures scheduled to begin operation before 1990.
   Only one of the five channels had been rented officially at the
time of liftoff, by the French cultural network La Sept for arts
programming.
   Industry sources said two more channels were likely to be taken
by the highly successful cable movie channel Canal Plus to transmit
family programming and German-language feature films.
   Another transponder might be used to broadcast reruns, mostly of
American television comedies, by the private French network TF1.
   To answer the competition, the French government decided in the
weeks before liftoff to further subsidize the cost of leasing
channels to operators. Instead of costing $20 million to $22
million, the French satellite will now cost about the same as its
competitor Astra, which leases channels for $6 million to $7 million.
   Astra, a medium-power, 16-channel satellite initiated by the
Luxembourg government, is scheduled for launch Dec. 9 aboard an
Ariane rocket. It has already leased most of its channels.
   For the moment, only 50,000 satellite dishes exist in all of
Europe and the equipment for receiving signals from the new French
satellite is more expensive than that of the competition.
   The French government will be watching the new satellite venture
with particular concern because it has a second $250 million
satellite scheduled for launch next year as a backup to this one.

<TEXT>
   A projected $55 million-plus lottery
prize that would return the North American title for big jackpots to
the state is making Californians' gambling fever rise again.
   Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for the
Saturday drawing were running about double the usual pace for
Thursday's sales.
   The official estimate of ``over $55 million'' for the drawing is
conservative, based on similar situations in the two-year history of
California's computerized Lotto 6-49 game, said lottery spokesman
Bob Taylor.
   On June 4, California's lottery paid out a $51.4 million jackpot,
North America's largest at the time. That jackpot was eclipsed Sept.
3 by a $55.1 million prize in Florida.
   The state-run lottery's policy is to estimate the jackpot
conservatively, then revise the projection upward as sales soar.
   It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the
1-in-14-million chance of winning the jackpot.
   ``The jackpot is going to generate an awful lot of sales,'' said
Taylor.
   The size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers,
which combine to produce heavy gambling periods, dubbed
``lottomania'' when they first struck other state's games.
   When nobody picks all six winning numbers out of a choice 49, the
jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize for the next
twice-weekly drawing.
   Four rollovers, including the rollover of a $33.4 million jackpot
Wednesday night, produced the current record prize estimate.
   The exact size of the jackpot will depend on how many tickets are
sold. Of every $1 ticket, 20 cents goes into the jackpot.
   Each time the jackpot climbs, so do sales, pushing the total
still higher, generating even more sales. Historically, most of the
sales occur in the last few hours before the televised drawing at
four seconds before 7:57 p.m. Sales are cut off at 7:45 p.m.
   By 2 p.m. Thursday, sales hit $1.2 million, which is normally the
total for the entire 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. sales period on a Thursday,
said Taylor.

   Members of a private aid network for the Nicaraguan
rebels regularly briefed the FBI and military intelligence about
their activities while allegedly violating the U.S. Neutrality Act,
government reports show.
   Seven of the men were indicted by a Fort Lauderdale grand jury in
June for violating the Neutrality Act by supplying mercenaries and
guns to the rebel Contras in 1984 and 1985. But they have challenged
the federal indictment, saying they were working closely with the
Reagan administration.
   FBI and Defense Intelligence Agency documents submitted by the
defense confirm that at least two of the indicted network members _
Thomas Posey, head of the Contra-supporting group called Civilian
Materiel Assistance, and his Miami coordinator, Jose Coutin _ were
regularly reporting to government officials at various levels,
including the National Security Council.
   ``The documents show the FBI knew, the FBI was sharing the
information with Oliver North'' at the National Security Council,
said attorney John Mattes, who represents co-defendant Jack Terrell.
``At one point Posey was calling the National Security Council from
the Miami FBI office ... the FBI acquiesced in all this conduct.''
   North, a former National Security Council officer and retired
Marine lieutentant colonel, has been charged with conspiring to
defraud the government by illegally diverting proceeds from arms
sales to Iran to a criminal ``enterprise'' that financed the
Contras. No date has been set for his trial.
   Miami FBI spokesman Paul Miller said Thursday he could not
comment on his agency's reports because the matter is before the
courts.
   A declassified report from military intelligence agent Franklin
Camper showed his agency not only knew of the activities in April
1984, but outlined for Posey and a Contra official a plan for raids
into Nicaragua by U.S. volunteers and Nicaraguan rebels. One plan
was to blow up a dam at a hydroelectric plant, leaving much of
Nicaragua without power.
   A January 1985 Miami FBI report showed that Larry Spivey, a
well-connected film producer who was working and traveling with
Posey, called the FBI to tell them about the network's plans.
   Posey, Terrell and possibly Coutin ``were getting ready to travel
to Costa Rica to take part in some type of `major military action
against Nicaragua,''' the FBI report stated.
   In all, Spivey, Coutin and Posey talked to FBI agents in Miami,
Birmingham and Los Angeles at least 10 times in Janauary 1985, and
Posey also spoke to agents in New Orleans.
   One FBI report quotes Posey as warning an agent that month that
``all hell is going to break loose in Central America'' in February.
   The documents also show Miami police informed the bureau in
September 1984 of the network's existence, and that drug-trafficking
money was being used to finance the Contra cause.
   The Miami FBI in turn directed the police and its own reports to
North at the request of FBI headquarters in Washington, according to
the bureau documents.
   Even as Posey talked to the FBI about his activities, it was
clear both he and the bureau were aware the network might violate
the U.S. Neutrality Act, which bars launching military activities
against a government with which the nation is at peace.
   The FBI even titled its internal memos on Posey and Coutin
``Neutrality Matters _ Nicaragua.''
   The other defendants are Mario Calero, brother of Contra leader
Adolfo Calero; Maco Stewart and Alex Martinez. The declassified
documents mentioned the three in passing, but they apparently did
not brief the FBI or other governmental agencies.
   The seventh defendant, Joe Adams, previously pleaded guilty to
the Neutrality Act charges, and was given one day's probation by
U.S. District Judge Norman Roettger.

   Thousands of physicians at an
international convention have called on a French company to resume
making an abortion pill or pass the patent onto another manufacturer.
   Roussel Uclaf, the company making RU 486, suspended production
Wednesday after groups threatened to boycott company products, but
said Thursday it may eventually distribute the drug once the outcry
dies down.
   Many of the 9,000 doctors and researchers at the weeklong World
Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics in Rio de Janeiro signed a
petition demanding Roussel Uclaf allow another company to produce
the drug.
   ``We are calling for health workers and doctors worldwide to
mobilize forces to demand the drug be taken from the drawer,'' said
Etienne Emile Baulieu, the professor who played a major role in
developing the pill. ``The suspension is a serious blow to women's
health.''
   Social groups, scientists, and politicians have criticized the
decision by Roussel Uclaf to suspend production.
   Anti-abortion groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, hailed
it. Foes of RU 486 say it puts abortions at womens' fingertips,
making abortion an easy form of contraception.
   In France, the drug can be taken only under medical supervision.
   Company officials in Paris said when they announced their
decision to suspend production that they were reacting to
international outcry against sale of the drug.
   ``We could resume distribution if the atmosphere returns to
normal,'' Pierre Joly, vice president of Roussel Uclaf, said on
French radio Thursday.
   Baulieu told The Associated Press: ``Roussel Uclaf has taken a
moralistic decision. There is absolutely no medical basis for the
suspension, which comes despite the approval of the drug by both the
French and Chinese governments in terms of safety and efficacy.
   ``The company is bowing to pressure from church groups and
conservative sectors of society,'' he added.
   Andre Ulmann, the RU 486 development chief, told a news
conference in Rio that production was suspended to avoid a
threatened international boycott of company products.
   Joly said the company acted because it was worried the anti-drug
climate might lead a woman under treatment to stop taking the drug
and risk birth defects. The company says the drug does tend to cause
such defects if it fails.
   Sheldon Segal, director of population sciences at the U.S.-based
Rockefeller Foundation, said in Rio, ``More than 500,000 women die
each year as a result of pregnancy _ more than 150,000 of those
after a dangerous surgical abortion.
   Women can take RU 486, also known as Mifepristone, for up to 49
days after conception. More than 100 clinics and hospitals in France
were using the drug and it was undergoing testing for use in China
and India.
   It was shown to effectively terminate pregnancy in 95 percent of
cases and started being used last month on a limited basis. It also
was being tested for such therapeutic purposes as treatment of
uterine cancer.
   RU 486, an anti-hormone, blocks the action of progesterone, the
hormone essential to pregnancy. Reasearchers say it is highly
effective, particularly when used with a second product called
Sulprotone, or prostaglandine E.
   Roussel Uclaf is part of the giant West German chemical group
Hoescht. The French government owns a 36 percent share.

<HEAD>Witnesses: Steinberg Appeared Unconcerned About Lisa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An attorney accused of beating his 6-year-old
illegally adopted daughter to death, when told she was probably
brain dead, replied, ``Is there anything else wrong with her?'' a
nurse testified in his murder trial.
   Joel Steinberg, 47, ``was not overly concerned about what was
going on,'' said Nancy Dodenhoff, who was working in the emergency
room of St. Vincent's Hospital when a comatose Lisa Steinberg was
brought in Nov. 2.
   Lisa's death drew national attention and made her a symbol of the
plight of abused children. The girl was obtained illegally from an
unmarried teen-ager and raised from birth by Steinberg and his
live-in lover, Hedda Nussbaum.
   Ms. Dodenoff testified Thurdsay that Steinberg didn't cry and his
tone of voice was ``very flat, very bland, unemotional'' when she
told him Lisa was likely brain dead. Steinberg left the emergency
room ``very quickly,'' she said.
   Medical technician Brian Gearity also testified that Steinberg
seemed unmoved by Lisa's condition.
   ``Mr. Steinberg was very cool, very calm, seemed very
unconcerned,'' said Gearity, who took the unconscious girl to the
hospital.
   Gearity said that when he and his partner arrived at Steinberg's
Greenwich Village apartment early Nov. 2, a woman he later learned
was Ms. Nussbaum answered the door.
   He said she had numerous facial injuries, including bruised eyes,
inflamed lips, a split on one lip and gash on her nose, which he
later learned had been broken.
   ``She looked like an old person in a young body,'' Gearity said.
``With all due respect to Ms. Nussbaum, she looked like the lion in
the `Beauty and the Beast' '' television show.
   Murder charges against Ms. Nussbaum were dropped Wednesday at the
request of prosecutors. She is expected to be the star government
witness against Steinberg.
   Ms. Nussbaum, 46, has undergone surgery and psychiatric treatment
for physical and emotional injuries her lawyer says were inflicted
by Steinberg.
   Gearity said Steinberg carried Lisa's nude, limp body into the
living room holding her under her armpits with his arms outstretched.
   ``She looked lifeless, like a limp doll, nothing moving,''
Gearity said.
   He said he and his partner cleared her throat of food, then took
her down to the ambulance.
   The child had marks on her body, Gearity's partner, John
Filangeri testified Tuesday.
   During cross-examination Thursday, one of Steinberg's attorneys,
Adrian DiLuzio, suggested that the marks on the child's chest were
caused by Steinberg's thumbs.
   Steinberg told police the marks on Lisa's chest and back were
caused by his attempts to revive her.
   Filangeri said he also found a large, swollen bruise on the
child's right temple.
   Lisa died of a head injury three days after being taken to St.
Vincent's.
   A 16-month-old boy, Mitchell, was found in the apartment sitting
in a dirty diaper and tethered to a playpen, authorities said. He
also was illegally adopted, and now lives with his biological mother.

   Israeli authorities rounded up more than a dozen
Palestinian journalists and trade unionists in what appeared to be a
security sweep before next week's general elections, Palestinian
witnesses said today.
   Army and police officials said they were checking the report.
   Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-PLO Palestinian newspaper Al
Fajr, said nine activists from Jerusalem and five from the West Bank
were arrested overnight.
   Siniora did not know on what charges the men were being detained.
Many are pro-PLO activists, and Siniora described them as ``part of
the budding local Palestinian leadership.''
   ``It's a security sweep before the Israeli elections,'' Siniora
told The Associated Press.
   The nearly 11-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip is a major issue in Tuesday's parliamentary
elections.
   Among the most prominent Palestinians detained in the reported
sweep is Saman Khouri, one of the leaders of the Palestine
Journalists Union. Khouri was released in May after being held five
months without a trial.
   Khouri's wife, Anita, said five agents of the Shin Bet secret
service and five riot policemen arrested her husband at his
Jerusalem home at about 1 a.m. today.
   ``I asked if they had an arrest warrant, and they said they
didn't need one,'' Mrs. Khouri told The AP.
   Also today, a 15-year-old Bedouin shepherd from the West Bank
village of Yatta was killed when he stepped on an explosive device
in an avocado grove in Aviezer, an Israeli farm southwest of
Jerusalem.
   Police said the object could have been an old land mine, noting
Aviezer is near the ``Green Line'' dividing Israel and the West
Bank, which Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Israel also seized the Gaza Strip from Egypt during that war.
   In other developments, the Israeli army magazine ``Bemahane''
said a soldier who shot dead a 5-year-old Palestinian in the West
Bank city of Nablus last week opened fire without justification.
   The magazine said the soldier fired in the air in violation of
standing orders, and that a stray bullet hit the boy, Deyaa Fayez.
   Army officials said the case was being investigated by military
police, and refused further comment.
   Fayez died Oct. 18 after being hit by plastic bullets in the
chest, stomach and left hand, according to Arab hospital officials.
He was the youngest of the 304 Palestinians and six Israelis killed
since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising.
   An initial army investigation said Fayez was hit by a stray
bullet fired from a lookout post about 400 yards from where the boy
was playing in the street.
   Under army regulations, plastic bullets can be fired to break up
violent protests, while live ammunition is restricted to
life-threatening situations.

   The sister of Terry Anderson, saying ``it is OK
to cut a deal,'' called on the United States to make concessions
that could free the longest held hostage and others abducted in
Lebanon.
   Peggy Say, speaking at one of several ceremonies to mark
Anderson's 41st birthday Thursday _ his fourth as a hostage _ also
said reporters should not look for impropriety in negotiations to
free hostages.
   ``I am not saying, `Give in to their demands.' I am saying,
`Engage in dialogue.''' said Mrs. Say. ``Iran offered us a deal.
They said, `Release our frozen assets and we will use our influence
to bring your hostages home.' We turned our back on it. We cannot
afford to do that.''
   Mrs. Say and journalists met with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, who condemned the hostages' captors as
perpetrators of ``a crime against humanity.''
   ``He did say he had some hope that something might develop before
Christmas, maybe one, maybe two hostages. He did not go into it, but
he said he was hopeful,'' said David Aikman of The Journalists'
Committee to Free Terry Anderson.
   Mrs. Say, of Cadiz, Ky., told reporters at a news conference:
``Send the message to this administration that it is OK to cut a
deal. Never has a hostage been freed without concessions being
made.''
   The Reagan administration repeatedly has said it will not
negotiate with those holding the hostages. It says that making deals
with captors only encourages further hostage-taking.
   At the news conference, a poster-size birthday card was unveiled.
It was drawn by Garry Trudeau, Anderson's favorite cartoonist, and
was signed by more than 1,000 journalists from 30 organizations.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted in Beirut on March 16, 1985, by the pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem faction called Islamic Jihad, or Holy War. He has been
held the longest of the 14 foreign hostages abducted in Lebanon.
   ``I watched with desperation the coming of his birthdays as a
hostage,'' freed French journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann said through
an interpreter at the news conference. ``We ask today whether Terry
even is aware that it is his birthday.''
   ``You should know that at this moment, as I speak to you, Terry
is in chains. His eyes are blindfolded. He doesn't see the sun or
the light of day. ``Terry suffers physically. The most terrible
thing, though, for him, and I can tell you this because I was also a
hostage ... is the feeling of having been abandoned. And I think he
is right,'' said Kauffmann.
   In other events marking Anderson's birthday:
   _In Lorain, Ohio, where Anderson was born, friends and relatives
tied new yellow ribbons to City Hall flagposts and planned a party
in his honor.
   _About 200 students at Buffalo State College in New York put on
yellow armbands, cut a birthday cake, signed a huge card and sang
``Happy Birthday.'' _In Batavia, N.Y., where Anderson grew up,
residents lit one candle for each of the 1,321 days of his captivity
on a big cake.
   _A former hostage, the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, collected birthday
cards for Anderson from children in Westminster, Calif., a Los
Angeles suburb.
   At a luncheon of the Committee to Protect Journalists, Mrs. Say
said the print and broadcast media should play a more active role in
publicizing the plight of the hostages so they will be freed.
   She said the presidential candidates have an ``unwritten
agreement'' that Anderson's captivity not become an issue. ``I'm
afraid (the election) will come and go and Terry will still be
there,'' she said.
   Kauffmann told the luncheon group that constant coverage by the
French press and public opinion caused the French government to seek
his release.
   ``Governments say that talking about hostages raises the
ransom,'' he said, ``but it's not true.''
   Also Thursday, the militants holding Anderson denied any links to
a woman who was arrested in Italy carrying a photograph of him.
   The New York news conference was sponsored by the Journalists
Committee to Free Terry Anderson, and No Greater Love, a non-profit
support group for hostages' families.

   Two Marine helicopters that crashed at night,
killing 10 servicemen, apparently collided less than 200 feet above
the Arizona desert, officials said.
   The Boeing CH-46 and Bell UH-1N helicopters were on a training
mission when the crash occurred Tuesday. A memorial service for the
nine Marines and one Air Force officer killed was set for this
afternoon at the chapel of the Marine Corps Air Station here.
   Investigators continued searching Thursday for clues in the
crash, said 1st Lt. Mary Baldwin, a Marine spokeswoman. She said she
was unsure how long it would take to complete the investigation.
   ``We feel confident enough to say a midair collision was more
than likely,'' said Gunnery Sgt. Hal Wheeler, a spokesman at the Air
Station.
   At the time of the accident, the CH-46, which was stationed at
the Marine Corps Air Station in New River, N.C., and the UH-1N out
of Camp Pendleton, Calif., were taking part in a training exercise.
Both were from 100 to 200 feet off the ground at the time of the
accident, officials said.
   The pilots were wearing night-vision goggles, Maj. Gen. Donald
E.P. Miller, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing commander at the Marine Corps
Air Station in El Toro, Calif., said in a statement read by Baldwin.
The statement did not say whether the goggles contributed to the
crash.
   Efforts to recover the bodies were hampered by the rough terrain
around the crash site at the foot of mountains on the Goldwater Air
Force Range about 125 miles east of the Yuma base.
   The remote desert area is accessible only by four-wheel drive
vehicles or helicopter, and the last body was not recovered until
Wednesday afternoon, Baldwin said.
   The exercise culminated a seven-week weapons-and-tactics
instructors course taught twice a year at the Yuma base.
   The crash was the second in the instructor course's history. In
1984, two Marines were killed when their light observation plane
crashed on the range.
   The twin-rotor CH-46 Sea Knight, built by Boeing until 1971, is
the Marines' main assault helicopter and has been involved in
several fatal crashes over the past few years.
   Tuesday's crash was the second in as many days involving military
helicopters in the Southwest.
   On Monday, a UH-1H helicopter hit a power line and crashed near
the U.S.-Mexico border in California, killing five lawmen and three
National Guardsmen during the first mission of a joint anti-drug
smuggling program.

   Bail for Imelda Marcos must be set quickly to
ensure that she and her husband do not try to flee the country, a
federal prosecutor says.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella argued Thursday that the
wife of the former Philippines president, Ferdinand Marcos, be
brought to New York for arraignment on racketeering charges.
   LaBella made his pitch when U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan
agreed to delay her husband's arraignment after defense lawyers
presented letters from three doctors saying Marcos was too ill to
travel the 5,000 miles from the couple's Hawaii home.
   In a related development, a newspaper reported today that federal
agents have obtained an arrest warrant for Saudian Arabian financier
Adnan Khashoggi.
   Khashoggi, who was indicted last week on racketeering charges
along with the Marcoses, is accused of acting as a front for Marcos
to help divert assets and hide Marcos' ownership of real estate and
valuable art.
   The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, said
officials believe Khashoggi won't surrender to face the charges. It
said the warrant was issued in an effort to find Khashoggi before he
relocates to a country without formal extradition agreements with
the United States.
   In New York, Keenan agreed with prosecutors that the physicians'
letters left out important details but said he would delay Marcos'
arraignment until a government physician could examine him or review
his medical records.
   But the judge refused to delay the arraignment of Mrs. Marcos,
who was indicted with her husband and eight others for an alleged
scheme that looted the Philippines of more than $100 million.
   Mrs. Marcos was ordered to appear Monday before Keenan, who said
he would allow her to return to Hawaii after setting bail.
   Despite pleas from Marcos' attorney, Richard A. Hibey, about the
expected ``circus atmosphere'' outside Manhattan's federal
courthouse and the lengthy flight to New York from Honolulu, Keenan
said: ``If the defendant was in New Jersey, the defendant comes to
New York to be arraigned. Hawaii is an American state. I don't see
any reason why she can't be arraigned here in New York.''
   LaBella opposed a Honolulu arraignment, claiming the FBI was
having difficulties keeping tabs on the couple, who are under
24-hour surveillance, at their Honolulu compound.
   He said ``the Marcos entourage has done things to neutralize the
surveillance. They have collected five or six or seven cars inside
the compound and released them at once, many of them with smoked
glass.
   ``It's the government's position that bail conditions must be set
at least for one of the defendants quickly so we can pull off this
surveillance and be sure the Marcoses will remain in the United
States pending these criminal proceedings.''
   Hibey scoffed at the idea that the Marcoses might flee, noting
that they are barred even from leaving the island of Oahu and that
the FBI has never lost sight of them.
   Neither Marcos nor his wife issued any comments, but a Marcos
attorney in Honolulu said: ``Mrs. Marcos will appear on Monday. The
court's decision is not without precedent. The state of his health
is definitely an issue that will come up again.''
   The defense sought to have both Marcos, 71, and his 59-year-old
wife arraigned at federal court in Honolulu, where they have lived
since fleeing the Philippines in February 1986.
   They presented letters from two Honolulu doctors and Marcos'
personal physician, saying Marcos suffered from an enlarged heart
and a thickening of the heart muscle.
   Prosecutors opposed the move, saying the letters were too vague.
   The letters, reviewed for prosecutors by Dr. Francis Weld, a
cardiologist at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, did not
indicate an ``inability to fly from Hawaii to New York,'' said
LaBella.
   Mrs. Marcos will leave Honolulu on Saturday night for New York
aboard a private luxury jet loaned by tobacco heiress Doris Duke,
74, who owns a Honolulu mansion, according to an aide to her husband.
   The jet will stop in San Francisco to pick up the couple's
daughter, Irene Araneta, and Marcos attorney John Bartko, Marcos
aide Arturo Aruiza said.

   Parents of police cadets at a training
academy where 16 trainees were hospitalized last month told of
alleged mistreatment at the hands of academy instructors.
   One cadet's mother said her son's arms swelled ``like Popeye's''
after a day of training at the Agawam academy. She was among the 100
people who packed a hearing Thursday on police training methods,
held by a panel of 21 law enforcement and medical experts appointed
by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   The review of training procedures was ordered after nearly a
third of the 50 cadets at the western Massachusetts academy became
ill after one day of training Sept. 19. One cadet required a liver
transplant and was in a coma for two weeks; the rest suffered from
kidney problems, dehydration and exhaustion.
   Cadets reported undergoing 10 hours of pushups, laps and other
exercise while only being allowed to drink a few cups of water.
   ``No one can convince me that our officers are in any more
control of a situation because of how many pushups they can do or
whether they can take being called a wimp or a sow,'' North Adams
Mayor John Barrett III testified at the hearing. Three North Adams
cadets were among the rookies hospitalized.
   Cadet Timothy Shepard of Pittsfield remained in serious condition
Thursday at a Pittsburgh hospital, where he underwent a liver
transplant last month. He collapsed from heat stroke during the
training.
   Michael Purcell, a former Army helicopter gunner, dropped out of
the academy after the first day. His mother, Elizabeth, said before
the hearing that his arms swelled ``like Popeye's'' after the
training.
   She criticized rules of the panel that barred any discussion of
training at Agawam last month. The panel has agreed not to probe the
subject, which is under investigation by the state attorney general,
and to concentrate instead on statewide training policies.
   ``Who are they kidding? In their minds (the Agawam academy) is
going to stay the way it is,'' she said.
   Joseph Lemay, who retired from the Chicopee police force after 36
years, testified that his daughter was forced to resign after her
fourth week at the academy in 1987.
   ``From the day she got in, they wanted her to resign because she
was a little slow in her running,'' he said. ``When they realized
they couldn't break her, they told her they would kick her out; they
made her resign.''
   He said the program forced 16 cadets in his daughter's class to
drop out.
   Colleen Griswold, an Amherst police officer who attended an
Agawam academy class last winter, said the training was tough but
necessary. She said instructors were fair, although some women and
minorities who failed the course have filed suit alleging
discrimination.
   ``I did not feel discrimination against me, nor did Hispanics in
my class feel discrimination,'' she testified. ``Our trainers did
the best they could with what was available.''
   The state has provided training for municipal police since 1984
under the Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council, which is
run by a 24-member board of law enforcement and appointed officials.
   The hearing opened a day after the director of the embattled
council took a leave of absence, saying the agency has been hampered
by the spotlight put on him since the Agawam incident. The academy
has been closed since Sept. 21.

<TEXT>
   Mozelle Wallace, the mother of former
Gov. George C. Wallace, died at age 90.
   She died Thursday evening at her Montgomery home after an
extended illness, said Elvin Stanton, the former governor's
executive assistant.
   She was hospitalized recently for kidney and heart problems, said
Marianne Dauphin, Mrs. Wallace's daughter.
   ``She was a very special, very strong, very gracious lady. I can
certainly understand where Dad got a lot of his strength and
character,'' said State Treasurer George Wallace Jr., son of the
former governor.
   Mrs. Wallace was born in Florida, but moved to Alabama as a
child, where she married farmer George C. Wallace Sr. After his
death in 1937, she supported her children by teaching music and a
girl's sewing class under a New Deal program. She moved to
Montgomery in 1942 and later worked for the Alabama Department of
Public Health. She retired in 1969 after 25 years with the agency.
   George Wallace served a record four terms as Alabama governor
before he left office in 1986. He ran for president four times,
including a 1972 bid cut short by an assassin's bullet which left
him confined to a wheelchair.
   Wallace, who has been bedridden for several months, was ``very,
very sad'' about his mother's death, said the younger Wallace.
   Mrs. Wallace is survived by four children, 11 grandchildren and
11 great-grandchildren.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Saturday morning.

   Two convicted murderers who held two women
hostage at a state prison before releasing them unharmed have
histories of violence inside jail, prison records show.
   Inmate Edward Robinson, 27, was disciplined by prison officials
in 1985 for threatening another person and again in 1986 for
assault. Robinson lost 180 days of compensation time that would have
moved up his 1994 parole eligibility. He is serving a life sentence
for murdering a man with a gunshot in the back of the head.
   Inmate Angel Guzman, 26, was disciplined in 1987 for disruptive
conduct and in 1983 had six months added to his 1989 parole date for
a weapon's charge and for assault, prison records show.
   Guzman, who has a tattoo on his forehead reading ``Lucifer Prince
of Darkness,'' is serving a life sentence for shooing his uncle
during an argument over $70.
   After taking the hostages Thursday, the two inmates demanded they
be transferred to a federal prison outside New Jersey and that
officials take no reprisals because of the hostage taking,
Department of Corrections spokesman James Stabile said.
   ``The negotiators agreed that the grievances of the two inmates
would be reviewed,'' said Gary Hilton, deputy corrections
commissioner.
   Robinson also asked to be allowed to call his mother, a demand
Hilton said would be granted.
   Annette Martin, a teaching assistant, and Joan Mason, a
vocational counselor, were taken hostage a 9:07 a.m. Thursday as
they conducted a teaching demonstration in the year-old Northern
State Prison's library, authorities said.
   ``It's hard to tell whether I'll go back to work,'' Mrs. Martin,
46, said after she was released. She declined to comment further.
   Negotiators spent hours talking through a mesh metal window to
the inmates, who used the women as shields while threatening them
with sharpened metal rods.
   ``There were repeated threats that they were prepared to do
violence to the hostages,'' said Hilton.
   He said the women were not physically harmed, but described them
as ``emotionally battered.''
   Mrs. Martin was released at 1:34 p.m.
   Her husband, Isaac Martin, said in a telephone interview that he
learned of his wife's plight from a noon radio broadcast.
   ``I just had to pray that it would come to a happy ending,'' he
said.
   Ms. Mason, 51, was taken from the library on a stretcher at 4:06
p.m., ending nearly seven hours as a hostage.
   Guzman and Robinson were to be transferred temporarily to the
Garden State Reception and Youth Correction Center, Hilton said. He
described the inmates as ``longtime friends'' who had been
imprisoned together before.

<TEXT>
   Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh has received
three checks totaling $235,070 from Ronnie DeSillers' estate after a
judge's ruling that the payments be made despite the protests of the
dead boy's mother.
   The payments drawn from Florida banks satisfy charges for three
liver transplants and related treatment for the boy who died in
April 1987.
   Hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon on Thursday displayed checks
for $90,000 from Coral Gables Federal bank, $85,070 from Grovegate
Bank of Coconut Grove and $60,000 from United National Bank of Miami
at Hialeah. All were drawn on accounts for DeSillers' estate and
made out to the hospital.
   Ms. McMahon said the checks were sent by the hospital's Florida
attorneys by overnight mail after Dade Circuit Judge Francis
Christie on Monday approved a settlement for the unpaid balance on
the boy's medical bills.
   The settlement amounted to 90 percent of the hospital's
outstanding charges of $261,000 for the boy's care.
   The boy's mother, Maria DeSillers, has been involved in legal
disputes for refusing to pay the balance of the boy's medical bills.
She is accused of withdrawing about $260,000 from the Coral Gables
Federal account, but less than $60,000 has been recovered. The money
was allegedly spent on a used BMW car and jewelry, and some was
given to her ex-husband and her boyfriend.
   Mrs. DeSillers had opposed payment of the balance, at first
claiming her son received inadequate treatment and this week
claiming he contracted the AIDS virus during treatment. The hospital
said the charges are false.

<HEAD>Arrested Palestinians Planned Foreign Attack, Sources Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of suspected Palestinian
terrorists arrested this week in West Germany planned an attack in
another country, security sources said today.
   West German authorities arrested 13 Palestinians in raids in
several West German cities on Wednesday and Thursday and seized a
large quantity of explosives, detonating devices and heavy-caliber
weapons.
   ``There were so many weapons you could arm an army,'' one
security source said.
   Security sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
declined to specify the target of the planned attack.
   The sources said three of the suspects arrived in West Germany
from a foreign country, while the other 10 lived in West Germany.
   One man came to West Germany from Damascus at the beginning of
the year, while the other two arrived the past two weeks. The
sources declined to specify where the other two men came from.
   The sources said the suspects had been under police surveillance
for some time.
   ``We had them under control,'' one source said.
   The arrested men were believed to be from the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a Syrian-controled
faction opposed to Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat.
   The faction is headed by Ahmad Jibril, a former Syrian army
captain.
   Western and Middle East intelligence reports say the group's
fighters have been leased to the Syrian and Libyan secret services
in the past to carry out assasinations and bombings.
   The most spectacular action by the group came last November, when
three guerrillas flying motorized hang-gliders infiltrated into
Israel across the Lebanese border and clashed with Israeli soldiers.
Six Israeli soldiers died and seven were wounded before the three
guerrillas were also killed.
   Security sources in Germany declined to give any details about
the arrested men. They said some of the suspects may be released
today for lack of firm evidence but that the three suspected
ringleaders who had arrived from abroad would be kept in custody.
   Jochen Ruhland, chief prosecutor in Duesseldorf, said the 13
Palestinians were arrested in raids throughout the country Wednesday
and Thursday.
   He said police searched 16 apartments and offices in West Berlin,
Hamburg, Frankfurt and Neuss, just outside Duesseldorf, and seized
explosives, detonators and incriminating documents.
   West German authorities previously had said they were concerned
about possible terrorist attacks linked to the Frankfurt trial of
confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem.
   However, Ruhland told The Associated Press that ``we have no
clues'' of any possible connection between the arrested Palestinians
and Hamadi.
   A Frankfurt judicial official, also speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said authorities recently circulated warnings about plans
for an imminent strike by Palestinian terrorists.

<HEAD>Tests Reveal Explorer's Son Suffered From Alzheimer's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alzheimer's disease, malnutrition and
dehydration caused the death of famed polar explorer Richard E.
Byrd's son, whose body was found in a warehouse, the state's medical
examiner says.
   The body of Richard E. Byrd Jr., 68, was found Oct. 3, but wasn't
immediately identified.
   An autopsy determined that Byrd died of ``malnutrition and
dehydration, contributed to by an underlying degenerative brain
disease ... Alzheimer's,'' Chief Medical Examiner John E. Smialek
said Thursday.
   Alzheimer's is an organic brain disease that gradually robs its
victims of memory and other intellectual powers. Its cause is
unknown and there is no cure.
   Byrd, a father of four, left Boston Sept. 13 to attend ceremonies
the next day at the National Geographic Society in Washington
honoring his father, Adm. Richard E. Byrd, who flew over the North
Pole in 1926 and later led a series of Antarctic expeditions.
   He never arrived in Washington. On Sept. 15 his family filed a
missing-person report with police in Needham, Mass.
   Smialek said Byrd's family had been unable to understand what
happened to Byrd after they put him aboard the train to Boston, and
were relieved to learn the cause.
   ``He was thought to be eccentric, but not in terms of actual
organic brain disease,'' Smialek said. ``I don't think they
suspected that.''
   Byrd's family told police he had some memory difficulties and
sometimes became confused, but had never wandered away.
   Smialek said Alzheimer's led Byrd to wander after getting off the
train in Baltimore.
   ``In his confused state, he could have appeared to be
intoxicated,'' the medical examiner said. ``He wasn't able to seek
help.''
   Instead, Byrd gradually became weak from lack of food and water.
   Byrd had been dead several days when his body was found, clad in
a green workman's uniform and one shoe. His wallet, luggage and
other personal property were missing. He was identified through a
Boston Transit Authority card found pinned to his undershorts.

<HEAD>Shamir: Arab Countries Must Play Role In Any Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said today peace
talks with the Palestinians would be impossible without Arab
countries playing a role and that Egypt and Jordan eventually would
have to join in such negotiations.
   But the right-wing Likud Party leader rejected an international
peace conference proposed by his chief rival in next Tuesday's
parliamentary elections, Foreign Minister and Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Shamir said he backed
U.S. help in the Middle East peace process but opposed participation
by the Soviets or the United Nations.
   Shamir insisted any move toward peace would have to come under
the U.S.-sponsored Camp David Accords signed in 1979 and would have
to include Egypt and Jordan.
   ``I cannot imagine any agreement with the Palestinians without
the help of some Arab countries,'' Shamir said in his office in
Israel's Knesset, or parliament.
   ``I am repeating my demand to resume negotiations about
implementation of the (Camp David) agreement, especially autonomy''
for the Palestinians, he said.
   The 73-year-old prime minister, wearing a gray suit, was relaxed
and smiling throughout the half-hour interview.
   He repeated his objections to an international Middle East peace
conference supported by Peres. He said if his Likud bloc is elected,
Egypt and Jordan would see it as a sign that Israel's people reject
a Peres' proposed international conference.
   ``Therefore, the chances of resuming negotiations in the
framework of Camp David will re-emerge,'' he said.
   Shamir also noted, however, that he has done everything possible
to implement the Camp David agreement, which calls for limited
Palestinian autonomy with their final status to be worked out later.
   He said he did not expect Egypt and Jordan to move quickly toward
talks even if Likud is elected.
   ``There is a necessity for patience and perseverance in the
efforts to convince potential partners to change their minds and
accept our proposals,'' he said.
   Shamir defined the Camp David accords as calling for negotiations
between Israel and representatives of Jordan, Egypt and responsible
Palestinians from within the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
captured from the neighboring Arab nations in 1967.
   In a second stage, Shamir said, elections would be held for a
Palestinian administrative council representing the Arabs in the
occupied lands in talks about the future of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Asked about his initial opposition to the Egyptian-Israeli peace
agreement, Shamir said he had feared it would set a precedent of
returning to pre-1967 borders and destroying Jewish settlements in
the then-occupied Sinai.
   In the campaign he has promised to expand such settlements in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and vowed not to return any
territory to Arab control.
   Calling the United States ``more than a friend'' of Israel,
Shamir said he would welcome a U.S. role in arranging negotiations
between his government and the Arabs.
   ``We cannot say the same ... about the United Nations,'' he said.
``The U.N. represents a permanent anti-Israeli majority.''
   Asked about a Soviet role, he replied that the Soviet Union has
played a negative role in the Middle East.
   ``The Soviet Union has a very strong anti-Israeli position
regarding our conflict with the Arab world,'' he said.
   Shamir refused to give details about what he would do to end the
``intefadeh,'' the uprising in the occupied lands that led to more
than 300 deaths since it erupted Dec. 8.
   He said he could not rule out the use of greater force but
admitted force could spur more resistance.

<TEXT>
   An oppposition spokesman today denied
government allegations that the Solidarity trade union federation is
hampering talks between Polish officials and Solidarity leaders.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said late Thursday that
Solidarity set preconditions to the talks by refusing to drop two
members of its negotiating team _ members the government says do not
respect Poland's ``constitutional order.''
   The two are Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron, Solidarity advisers and
government critics.
   Urban said Solidarity was trying to blame the government for the
delay in the start of talks but that it was not possible to reach
agreement with activists of a ``confrontational orientation who aim
to destabilize the state.''
   His statement was carried by the official PAP news agency.
   Opposition mediator Andrzej Stelmachowski responded, ``It is not
our side which has the stiff position.''
   ``Today it practically looks like a breakdown, but Lech Walesa
has not closed the door and the affair is open,'' Stelmachowski
said. ``The ball is on the other side now.''
   Walesa, the Solidarity leader, said he will not drop Michnik and
Kuron from the Solidarity delegation, because he said it would set a
precedent.
   ``I see a lack of political will to solve the problems that
divide us,'' Walesa said.
   In addition to the government's objections to Michnik and Kuron,
Walesa complained about the dismissals of at least 100 miners in
Silesia who took part in August strikes and had been promised job
security.
   He refused a government demand that he meet with Interior
Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak to clear up final obstacles to the
start of the talks on political, social and economic reform.
   The government said the talks have begun today if Walesa agreed
to meet Kiszczak.
   The talks were originally proposed in August during Poland's
worst wave of labor unrest in seven years.
   Walesa agreed Aug. 31 to join Kiszczak in talks after being
guaranteed that they could include the topic of the future of
Solidarity as well as broader issues of political and economic
reform.
   Solidarity was suppressed in a December 1981 military crackdown
and was outlawed the next fall.

   Studio drivers planned to return to
work Monday after voting to approve a new Teamsters contract, ending
their three-week strike against movie and television producers.
   The striking Teamsters voted 1,039-190 in favor of the new pact
during balloting Thursday night, said Earl Bush, secretary-treasurer
of Teamsters Local 399.
   ``That is the official tally,'' Bush said. ``We'll have tomorrow
and the weekend to remove the personnel they hired and we'll go back
to work on Monday.''
   Neither Bush nor producers officials would discuss terms of the
contract.
   Earlier in the evening, striking electricians voted 160-54 to
settle their strike with the Alliance of Motion Picture and
Television Producers.
   Neither union expressed satisfaction with the terms of the new
contracts.
   The Teamsters transport actors, equipment and props for
television and film producers. The strike began on Oct. 3. The
tentative settlement was reached last weekend in talks held in
Florida between the producers and Teamsters leaders.
   Joining the Teamsters on the picket lines were 1,000 members of
two other so-called Basic Crafts unions, the electricians and the
laborers. The laborers have since decided to end their strike.
   The strike by the three unions had less of an impact on Hollywood
production than this year's crippling five-month scriptwriters'
strike. Early reports of violence, however, did force the Cannell
Studios to halt production briefly on the NBC series ``Hunter'' and
``Sonny Spoon'' during the strike's first week.
   Key issues dividing the Teamsters and the producers included
overtime rules for weekend work, salary rates, wages for out-of-town
film and television production, studio seniority and guidelines for
the making of nonunion films.
   An earlier contract proposal by the producers had asked some
drivers to take pay cuts from $16.61 an hour to $14 an hour.

<TEXT>
   President Kenneth Kaunda, Zambia's founding
father, easily won another five-year term by receiving about 90
percent of the votes in an election in which he was the only
candidate for the only legal party.
   Three-quarters of the ballots had been tallied by midday today
from Wednesday's presidential and parliamentary election. The ballot
papers were printed with an eagle symbol for the president, a frog
to reject him.
   Kaunda, 64, who led the former British colony of Northern
Rhodesia to independence as Zambia Oct. 24, 1964, has won elections
every five years as the sole presidential candidate.
   The United National Independence Party, the country's only lawful
political movement since Kaunda declared a one-party state in 1972,
fielded 609 candidates vying for the 125 seats in the National
Assembly.
   Results announced from 90 of the 125 constituencies gave Kaunda
just over 90 percent of the vote. There are 2.6 million registered
voters in Zambia.
   The massive ``yes'' vote gave the head of state a mandate to
carry out economic reforms needed to check galloping inflation,
record unemployment and rising urban crime.
   Most government ministers clung to their posts, according to the
results, indicating continued support for a government often accused
of mismanagement and corruption.Three Cabinet ministers lost their
seats.
   Prime Minister Kebby Musokotwane held on to his constituency and
is expected to remain premier in the new Cabinet.
   Kaunda was unlikely to make any statement on the polling trend
until after the final results are announced Saturday, aides said.
   Kaunda needed a simple majority of the ballots cast to remain in
power, or two-thirds of the total registered voters' support.

<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pennsylvania couple who want genetic
testing of a girl they believe is their daughter will get a chance
to present their case to a judge on Nov. 4.
   Sarasota Circuit Judge Andy Owen said Thursday he would hear the
petition of Regina and Ernest Twigg of Langhorne, Pa., who want the
sophisticated blood test to determine parentage of Kimberly Michell
Mays, 9.
   The child is at the core of a developing battle between the
Twiggs and Robert Mays, a 43-year-old Sarasota roofing supply
salesman who has raised the fourth-grader as his daughter.
   The Twiggs allege that their newborn was swapped with a sickly
infant at a central Florida hospital in 1978 in a baby-selling
scheme. They think their baby was given to Mays. The child they took
home from the hospital, Arlena, died of a heart defect in August
after genetic testing that revealed she could not have been their
biological daughter.
   Mays opposes testing. He says the Twiggs base their claim on
speculation and have offered no proof that the child he loves and
raised is theirs.
   He vows to fight any effort to take Kimberly, no matter what any
genetic test might show.
   The Twiggs are prepared to push ahead with a legal custody battle
if necessary, their Clearwater attorney John Blakely said.
   ``If Kimberly is their daughter, they do not know of any fact at
this time that would cause them not to pursue custody of their
child,'' Blakely said. ``They are simply driven by their natural
paternal and maternal instincts to pursue and protect their own
offspring.''

   The dollar rallied from four-month lows against
most major currencies in light European trading early today. Gold
prices moved lower.
   Dealers said the dollar was likely to trade within a narrow range
for the rest of the day.
   The dollar had retreated after the U.S. government reported
Wednesday that the third-quarter gross national product rose at an
annual rate of 2.2 percent, the smallest rise in almost two years.
Dealers said signs of central bank support had kept the dollar from
sliding further.

<HEAD>Pilot Flying Illegally At Time of Crash, FAA Official Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of Delta Flight 191 was flying
illegally when his jetliner crashed during a thunderstorm at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, killing 137 people, a
federal offical said.
   The medical certification of Capt. Edward M. Connors was invalid
because the pilot failed to list prescription drugs and hospital
stays on his application for certification, Audie W. Davis, a
Federal Aviation Administration medical certification officer,
testified Thursday.
   Delta Air Lines attorneys contend the testimony about Connors'
use of prescription drugs is useless because the co-pilot, who also
was killed, was at the controls when the plane crashed attempting to
land during a 1985 thunderstorm.
   The applications are submitted after pilots take required
physical examinations at six-month intervals, Davis said.
   His testimony came in a non-jury trial of a lawsuit filed by
Delta against the government. The airline claims government
employees, such as air traffic controller and weather forecasters,
did not notify the crew of the doomed airliner that a severe
thunderstorm was located in their landing path.
   Davis, manager of the Aeromedical Certification Branch of the FAA
in Oklahoma City, spent two days on the witness stand.
   Connors failed to fully disclose on his application that he had
been treated at two Fort Worth hospitals and that he had been
prescribed drugs such as the tranquilizer Stelazine and the muscle
relaxer Robaxin, and other antihistamines, antibiotics and
decongestants, Davis said.
   ``The general problem (with the drugs) is how they affect general
alertness,'' Davis said. ``They could cause drowsiness or
dizziness.''
   The government is introducing the medical testimony in an attempt
to show that Connors could have made errors in judgment and was
medically unfit to fly.
   Three doctors testified earlier this week that they did not think
the dosage of Stelazine they prescribed for Connors was strong
enough to affect his flying performance.
   U.S. District Judge David O. Belew recessed the trial until
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Dismiss Suit Over Paul Newman's Salad Dressing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Paul Newman has lost the latest
round in his legal battle with a deli owner over profits generated
by Newman's salad dressing.
   A state Appellate Court on Thursday refused to dismiss Julius
Gold's lawsuit against Newman, writer A.E. Hotchner and food broker
David Kalman.
   Gold claims in the lawsuit that the three men reneged on a
promise to share with him the profits from Newman's Own salad
dressing and several other food items.
   Gold says he helped develop and market the dressing and was
promised 8 percent ownership of two corporations started from the
food ventures.
   A trial ended in mistrial June 23 because jurors had
inadvertently been given material ruled inadmissible. A second trial
is scheduled for next week in Bridgeport Superior Court.
   Newman, who lives in Westport, contends he developed the dressing
in his home, then decided to sell it with Hotchner, with the profits
going to charity. They later expanded and began selling popcorn,
lemonade and spaghetti sauce under Newman's name.
   Gold's lawyer, Richard Albrecht, said Gold has offered to give up
any stock he believes he is owed in exchange for a settlement, which
would go to a tax-free charitable foundation.
   ``He wants the power of selecting which charities the money goes
to rather than leaving that decision to Newman,'' Albrecht said.

<HEAD>Grosz Says He'll Resign As Premier; Will Remain Party Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz said
in an interview published today that he will resign as premier next
month. He will retain the more important job as secretary-general of
the party.
   Grosz, 57, who has held the premier's post for 16 months, has
repeatedly said he wants to focus on party affairs and that the two
functions, of premier and party leader, are too much for one person.
   Grosz took over in May as secretary-general of the Communist
Party, which sets policy in Hungary.
   In an interview with the government daily newspaper Magyar
Hirlap, Grosz said he will ask the Communist Party's Central
Committee to relieve him of his duties as premier.
   The resignation is expected to be approved by the Parliament on
Nov. 24.
   Grosz said five people have emerged as possible successors, but
he did not identify them.
   According to unconfirmed reports, one person high on the list is
Miklos Nemeth, a Politburo member and a party secretary.
   Grosz said he felt ``highly dissatisfied'' with his performance
as premier but added that he was confident of a ``dynamic progress''
in the government's program of economic reforms.
   Under an austerity package passed last year, Hungarians are
suffering under the burden of an 18 percent inflation rate and $18
billion foreign debt.
   Hungary, however, has the Soviet bloc's most free-market oriented
economy.
   Among economic-development goals approved under Grosz are more
foreign investment, fewer restrictions on the ownership of foreign
capital and expansion of private initiatives.
   In his interview splashed over two pages, Grosz also referred to
an official ban on a demonstration Oct. 23 that was to mark the
start of the 1956 anti-communist uprising.
   Several hundred Hungarians defied the ban and police detained
five people for ``making offensive statements.''
   ``On Oct. 23, 1956, the character of the tragic events was mainly
counterrevolutionary, and we cannot permit the memory of a
counterrevolution being marked as a signal event,'' Grosz said.

   A man who paid $815 at an Internal Revenue Service
auction for what he thought was a 14-karat gold chain has discovered
that he actually bought a worthless imitation.
   Jack LaRue bought the chain this week at an IRS auction of
jewelry, furs and other items seized for back taxes from an
imprisoned heroin dealer.
   ``They had stated that it had a retail value of $1,920,'' LaRue
said.
   ``Right after the auction, I noticed that the clasp was broken,
so I went down to a jeweler,'' he said. ``About half an hour later,
he called me and said, `I hate to tell you this, but the chain is
worthless.'''
   The firm that first appraised the chain for the IRS examined it a
second time and confirmed that it was a phony.
   William Brantley, an IRS supervisor, said the agency can't help
LaRue.
   ``All our sales are final,'' he said. ``We had an appraisal done,
and that's what we went on.''

<TEXT>
   A rebellious gallery owner, told he
couldn't park his Rolls-Royce for more than an hour on fashionable
Rodeo Drive, used a fleet of the elegant cars to get around the
order.
   David Spellerberg said he had chauffeurs take turns Thursday
parking five different classic Rolls-Royces in front of his art
gallery so that tourists visiting the city would get a taste of what
Beverly Hills is famous for.
   Spellerberg launched his new car show to get around a preliminary
injunction prohibiting him from parking his navy blue 1954 Silver
Wraith Rolls-Royce on Rodeo Drive for more than one hour at a time.
   The order was issued last week by Superior Court Judge Edward
Kakita in response to claims by the city that the $200,000 car is a
nuisance when it is parked continually on Rodeo Drive.
   Police Lt. Robert Curtis said officers carefully watched
Spellerberg's Rolls-Royce rotation and saw no violation of the court
order.
   According to the order, Spellerberg is required to move his car
at least 500 feet away after parking it for an hour in front of his
business and is not allowed to return it there until four hours
later.
   The gallery owner said he plans to continue rotating his cars six
days a week.
   ``We came with the idea of bringing glamour back to Rodeo
Drive,'' he said. ``People come here from all over the world and
expect to see something exciting. Beverly Hills has a tradition to
keep up.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis, turning to ``a
little preaching'' in a Baptist church, told black supporters today
they won't be shut out of a Dukakis White House.
   He was introduced at a church rally by the Rev. Wallace S.
Hartsfield, who said that during the Reagan administration there
have been ``a few at the head of the table who refuse to pass the
bread.''
   ``We're not only going to pass the bread, but you're going to be
at the table,'' Dukakis said.
   He opened his remarks by telling the crowd, ``I've got a little
preaching to do.''
   Dukakis also also promised an aggressive stance against the South
African government.
   ``With Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen as president and vice
president of the United States, this nation is going to take the
lead in breaking the back of apartheid,'' he said as the
predominantly black audience cheered.
   Dukakis is trailing in all national polls, but he told the church
audience, ``In politics, as you all know, 11 days is an eternity.
There is time to do it.''
   Dukakis played host at a town meeting Thursday night in nearby
Independence, Harry Truman's hometown, saying he was inspired by the
visit and confident he could, like Truman, pull off an upset.
   After a lively interview on CBS, the Democratic presidential
nominee carried his enthusiasm to the town meeting. Dukakis likened
his stances to Truman's on a number of issues and laughed at
Reagan's statement earlier in the day, during a campaign trip to
Missouri for Bush, that Truman would support the vice president and
the Republican Party today.
   ``I cannot imagine him supporting George Bush,'' Dukakis said,
laughing as he spoke. ``That has to be one of the most incredible
statements of all time. ... I know he'd be four-square behind the
Democratic ticket.''
   The visit to Independence came at a time when Dukakis, trailing
Bush in national polls, frequently invokes the name of Truman and
his 1948 upset over Thomas Dewey to support his prediction that the
same will happen this year.
   Among those questioning Dukakis at the town meeting was John
Truman, the great-great nephew of Harry Truman. John Truman asked
Dukakis if he had anything in common with the late president.
   ``We're a little behind but we're going to win,'' promised
Dukakis.
   ``My memory of President Truman was that he demonstrated his
passion by the things he did,'' said Dukakis, promising to do the
same with health care, child care, economic development and
education programs. ``We're going to put our government on the side
of average families.''
   He also invoked the ``L-word'' Republicans use at every
opportunity to describe Dukakis.
   ``Harry Truman was a liberal who balanced budgets,'' Dukakis
said. ``That's who I am. I'm someone who I like to think combines
those strong, progressive type values'' with fiscal conservatism, he
said.
   Dukakis promised to fulfill Truman's dream of providing basic
health insurance to all Americans.
   ``If Harry S. Truman were here tonight, he'd be urging us to do
it,'' Dukakis said.
   The Democrat also contended Bush had avoided questions in the
final weeks of the campaign.
   ``If you're not willing to get out among people and take
questions and respond in this kind of way, then how do we know what
you're going to do when you're president of the United States,''
said Dukakis, who has hosted three town meetings in less than a week.
   The CBS interview was part of the Dukakis campaign's effort to
broaden their candidate's exposure and to draw a contrast with Bush,
whose style since the second presidential debate appears designed to
protect his lead in the polls by stressing proven themes and
avoiding forums that could create openings for the Democrats.
   During the nearly 15-minute CBS appearance, Dukakis stressed his
theme that he and running mate Lloyd Bentsen are on the side of
average Americans while Bush is the candidate of privilege who wants
to dole out a multi-billion dollar tax break to the nation's
wealthiest 1 percent.
   ``I want the government of this country to be on the side of
average Americans and I think that's a fundamental difference
between me and George Bush,'' Dukakis said in the CBS interview.
   The candidate disputed Bush's portrayal of him as being soft on
crime, taking about the mugging of his father and the hit-and-run
death of his only brother.
   He also constrasted his choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his
running mate with Bush's pick of Indiana Sen. Dan Quayle.
   ``Dukakis made the presidential decision, Bush made the political
decision,'' Dukakis said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of farmers demanding higher
prices for their crops camped out today with their tractors on a
road leading to the presidential palace and demanded to speak to
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   ``If the prime minister has any sympathy for farmers, he will
come to us,'' said Bhopal Singh, a protest leader. ``We will not
talk to his ministers.''
   It was the fourth day of their protest, and they say they won't
move until their demands are met. The farmers have been sleeping in
the shade of tractors by day and burning fires of dried cow dung by
night to keep warm.
   The farmers lined up their tractors on a road leading from the
India Gate war memorial to the presidential palace in New Delhi.
Police blockaded the road about a half mile from the palace but have
not attempted to move the farmers.
   Just in front of the police barrier lay the body of a farmer who
died Thursday of a heart attack. Protesters file past the body,
which was resting on ice slabs and draped in the green flag of the
Farmers' Union.
   The protest has embarrassed Gandhi's Congress Party because it
has scheduled a mass rally at the same place for Monday. That day
marks the fourth anniversary of the assassination of former Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, Rajiv's mother.
   Protest leaders are demanding that the prime minister meet with
them. They say promises from local administrators were not kept
after the farmers ended a monthlong siege of government offices in
January outside New Delhi.
   The United News of India, a news agency, quoted Gandhi as telling
reporters that he was ``willing to do anything for farmers, but
nothing will be done under pressure.''
   The farmers say they want higher prices for their crops. Their
goods are sold primarily to the government, which stockpiles them
for distribution to the poor at subsidized rates. The protesters
also want the government to waive repayment of farm loans and to
subsidize their electricity bills.

   A man who told police he robbed a grocery store
owner because he had lost his job and could not pay his bills says
he returned the money six hours later because his conscience was
bothering him.
   ``It was wrong,'' Duncan Laplant Jr. said Thursday after he was
released on a personal recognizance bond. ``It was a stupid thing to
do.''
   Laplant, 33, and Russell M. Robinson, 22, were charged with
felony theft in the robbery Wednesday outside a bank. They were
accused of taking a bag with cash and checks from the previous day's
receipts.
   They were arrested after returning the money to the grocery store
and replacing $14 they had spent, police said.
   Assistant District Attorney George Prietz recommended that they
be placed on personal recognizance bonds because they had cooperated
with authorities.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of five people who ate ``death cap''
mushrooms at a dinner party is recovering from a successful liver
transplant and a nationwide search is underway to find liver donors
for two others.
   The remaining two members of the dinner party who ate the
mushrooms Saturday were being evaluated hourly to determine if they
also will need transplants.
   Dr. C. Wright Pinson, director of the liver transplant program at
Oregon Health Sciences University, estimated the chances were
``50-50'' that enough donor livers could be found for all five.
   Even if they all undergo transplants, they could suffer permanent
brain damage, doctors said.
   At a news conference Thursday in Portland, Pinson said the
patient who underwent surgery and the two awaiting transplants had
suffered irreversible liver damage. When such damage occurs, he
said, the patient usually dies in two to four days.
   ``Even when you list a patient at a very high priority, as we've
listed our patients, it takes an average of 3{ days to find a graft,
so you see we have some inherent logistical problems here,'' Pinson
said.
   Dr. Emmet Keeffe, chairman of the committee that determines who
will get liver transplants at Oregon Health Sciences University,
said doctors believe only three liver transplants had been performed
in the United States because of death cap mushroom poisoning. All
three survived, he said.
   Preston Alexander, president of the Oregon Mycological Society,
identified the mushrooms as Amanita phalloides, which doctors say
are the most deadly of all mushrooms.
   Among other things, the poison prevents the liver from producing
protein. ``Basically, the liver just dies off,'' said Pat Forsyth,
spokeswoman for the University of California-San Francisco Medical
Center.
   The species is common in Europe but has been found only in recent
years in the western United States. Doctors had to speak at length
with doctors in Europe to learn more about the poison, Pinson said.
   Eating less than one of the mushrooms can be fatal, Alexander
said. Dr. Muhamud Daya, assistant professor of emergency medicine at
Oregon Health Sciences University, said the five who became ill ate
a total of at least 10.
   John and Teresa Duncan of Portland were the hosts of the dinner
party where the mushrooms were eaten, Alexander said.
   Alexander said the Duncans' daughter told him some members of the
dinner party had picked the mushrooms while searching for chestnuts
on the Washington side of the Columbia River Gorge.
   The mushrooms resemble a variety that is sold commercially in the
Orient, he said.
   Glenda Sabolyk, 41, of Clackamas, underwent transplant surgery
Thursday at the University of California-San Francisco Medical
Center. Dr. Nancy Ascher, director of the UCSF transplant program
and head surgeon during the operation, said the new liver appeared
to be functioning well.
   Doctors were searching for a donor liver for Mrs. Duncan, 43, who
was in critical condition at Oregon Health Sciences University
Hospital. Her husband, who declined to reveal his age, was in
serious condition at Bess Kaiser Hospital in Portland, where doctors
said he had improved Thursday.
   A fourth patient was at the San Francisco hospital awaiting a
suitable donor, and the fifth was being evaluated at University
Hospital.

   The missing skipper of a ship that
sank with hundreds aboard sailed six hours through raging seas
before changing course in a hopeless attempt to escape Typhoon Ruby,
an official said today.
   Rescuers continued searching today for up to 253 people reported
missing from Monday's disaster.
   A coast guard spokesman in Cebu City said two cutters and two
commercial ships resumed the search at dawn around remote islands
where the 2,855-ton Dona Marilyn sank, 300 miles southeast of Manila.
   A shipping official said 201 people were rescued and 65 bodies
recovered. Officials said survivors reached small islands that lack
communications and some may have been counted twice by different
government agencies.
   There also was confusion over how many people were aboard the
Dona Marilyn when it sailed Sunday from Manila for Tacloban, on
Leyte Island. Sulpicio Lines, the ship's owner, says there were 421
passengers and 66 crew members, but the numbers have varied in
reports by company and coast guard officials.
   Figures compiled today from Red Cross and government agencies
showed the typhoon also killed 233 other people on land before
roaring into the South China Sea on Tuesday.
   Manila newspapers said today the names of 52 people reported
rescued do not appear on the ship's manifest. But some of those
could be crew members since Sulpicio has not released a complete
list of its employees who were aboard.
   Jose Alcuaz, chairman of the National Telecommunications
Commission, told a Senate committee today that according to company
records Capt. Eliodoro Salgado radioed at 2:14 a.m. Monday that he
was reducing speed because of ``big waves.''
   At 7:28 a.m., Salgado, who is listed as missing, reported
shutting down his engines because of ``minor difficulties'' and was
being buffeted by ``very strong winds and waves,'' Alcuaz said.
   Later, Alcuaz said, the captain reported changing course at 8:20
a.m. and was headed west, away from the typhoon. Sulpicio says the
ship sank at about 3 p.m. after the crew tried vainly to pump out
seawater.
   Survivors interviewed by Manila television station GMA said many
passengers were trapped in their cabins when the ship sank.
   Bernardo Cabigon, Sulpicio station manager in Tacloban, said one
elderly couple refused the crew's instructions to leave, embraced
one another and sank with the ship.
   Cabigon quoted surviving crew members as saying the chief
engineer gave up his place in a lifeboat to a passenger and
disappeared in the raging seas.
   A Sulpicio official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the ship's purser, Kerwin Lim, reached an island but was stabbed to
death by residents who stole his gold necklace and threw his body
into the surf.
   President Corazon Aquino has threatened to suspend the owner's
operations for letting the liner sail into the storm.
   Mrs. Aquino said Thursday she may take action if the Department
of Transportation finds the company negligent.
   Philip Tuazon, administrator of the government's Maritime
Industry Authority, said Sulpicio was ordered to appear at a hearing
next Wednesday ``to explain why we should not suspend them.''
   Jose Baldicanas, the government's transportation undersecretary,
said the ship received a permit to sail because the weather was
clear when it left for Tacloban, 350 miles to the southeast.
   Another company ship was involved in one of the world's worst
peacetime shipping disasters when it collided in December 1987 with
an oil tanker off Mindoro island. Official reports put the death
toll at about 1,700, but most estimates placed the actual figure at
more than 3,000. Only 28 people survived.

   A woman who faces up to life in
prison on charges that she falsely accused two men of rape to get
``even'' has been released on bail and ordered to get counseling.
   District Judge Kenneth Kosnic ordered the counseling at a
preliminary examination Thursday and released Christine Burzynski
from the Macomb County jail here on a $5,000 bond.
   Burzynski testified in January that two men raped her at gunpoint
outside a bowling alley in an eastern Detroit suburb.
   But in June, she admitted that she fabricated the charge,
Sterling Heights Detective Gino Hliebay testified Thursday.
   ``She said it had something to do with getting even with them for
some reason,'' Hliebay told the judge.
   After she recanted, prosecutors dropped charges against the men,
who had insisted they were innocent. Polygraph tests showed they
believed they were telling the truth, the detective said.
   Assistant prosecutor Steven Kaplan said the woman had sex with
the two men at a motel on Nov. 5, 1987, the day of the alleged rape,
and that they threatened to tell her boyfriend. The threat
apparently prompted the rape story she told her boyfriend, who in
turn talked her into contacting police, he said.
   ``She got herself cornered,'' Kaplan said.
   Burzynski was arraigned earlier this week on two charges of lying
under oath, which carries a penalty of up to life in prison. She has
not entered a plea and no trial date has been set.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Ministers Issue Nuclear Statement; Belgians Dispute
Wording</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with comments after talks. TRIMS. No

   NATO defense ministers today said
the Western alliance needs to maintain nuclear weapons with a
variety of ranges in Europe to ``take account of the scale and
quality of the threat.''
   The statement released at the end of talks by the defense chiefs
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization made no mention of
Belgium's refusal to endorse a report on the need for short-range
nuclear forces.
   NATO's secretary-general, Manfred Woerner, said the ministers'
private talks were ``an occasion for full and frank discussion, and
this meeting was no exception.'' He told reporters, ``No decision on
specific weapons systems are required now nor have they been taken.''
   U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said, ``We are moving
forward on a modernization program on a step-by-step basis... We're
very satisfied with the way the meeting progressed.''
   Belgium's defense minister, Guy Coeme, expressed concern about
deciding now on the controversial issue of modernizing short-range
arms. ``Assuming any commitment now would be premature,'' he said at
a separate news conference.
   NATO's short-range arsenal has gained the spotlight of critics
since the United States and the Soviet Union signed the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty in December. By the end of
1990, the treaty will eliminate all U.S. and Soviet land-based
missiles with ranges of 300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Short-range weapons generally have a range of less than 300 miles.
   In their statement, the ministers said, ``Our step-by-step
approach, under which decisions will be taken when necessary, will
ensure that NATO's nuclear forces continue to provide a credible and
effective contribution to the alliance's strategy of deterrence.''
   It said the ministers ``agreed that for the foreseeable future
NATO requires diversified, survivable and operationally flexible
nuclear forces in Europe across the entire spectrum of ranges, which
take account of the scale and quality of the threat.''
   The officials, the statement said, were ``encouraged by signs of
change in the policies of the Soviet Union and some of its allies.''
But, it added, ``We have seen as yet no relaxation in their military
efforts.''
   ``In particular,'' it said, ``Warsaw Pact superiority in
conventional forces, with the capability this provides for surprise
attack and large scale offensive action, constitutes a basic source
of instability and tension between East and West.''
   As a result, the ministers said they were determined to take
necessary actions to maintain alliance security and ``maintain the
credibility of our deterrent forces, conventional and nuclear, which
will be kept up-to-date where necessary.''
   The High Level Group report sought support for the concept of
continuing to rely on short-range nuclear weaponry as a pillar of
Alliance defense.

   Two empty railroad locomotives rolled off an
elevated track today and fell 50 feet onto one of London's busiest
highway junctions.
   The roads were deserted when the pre-dawn crash occurred, and
there were no injuries or damaged vehicles, police said.
   The two 107-ton diesel engines, which were linked, rolled 400
yards forward, crashed through a barrier, and landed one on top of
the other.
   They partly blocked the cloverleaf junction connecting the M1,
London's main northbound exit, to the North Circular Road, the
capital's inner beltway.
   Scotland Yard said the junction, one of London's busiest, might
be shut for several days.
   A spokesman for state-owned British Rail said officials were
investigating.
   ``Clearly brakes don't just come off of their own accord, so
vandalism is not ruled out,'' said spokesman Francis Thomas.

<HEAD>Pig's Days Numbered As Household Pet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who keeps a 700-pound pig in the front
yard of her inner city home faces up to a $200-a-day fine if her pet
porker isn't moved to the country.
   City officials say they'll enforce an ordinance against Victoria
Herberta, who has kept pigs at her home since 1984.
   ``We can laugh about it and look at it as comical,'' says Robert
Armstrong, head of the city's animal control office. ``But we don't
have to live next door to a pig.''
   Ms. Herberta, who calls her pet pig Jeffrey Jerome, has a Dec. 8
court appearance after animal control officers delivered a citation
to her this week.
   ``He's not just any pig,'' she says. ``His mother saved a human
life and look how I'm being rewarded.''
   Jerome's mother, Priscilla, gained wide attention in 1984 for
saving a child drowning in Lake Somerville.
   A neighbor complained to a city councilman, saying the pig was
filthy. Councilman Rodney Ellis said he passed along the complaint
to the health department.
   The white pig, with one blue and one brown eye, lives in the
woman's front yard, eats hot dogs, grapes and candy, sips soda pop
and has become somewhat of a local tourist attraction. Ms. Herberta,
49, bathes him in a tub, brushes his teeth and says she occasionally
lets the pig sleep in her bed.
   ``A pig is a pig is a pig,'' Armstrong says. ``This may be a
VIPig but it's still a pig.''

<HEAD>China Considering Dalai Lama's Proposal for a Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chinese government said today it is trying to
agree on a time and place for talks with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's
exiled leader.
   Chinese officials said in September they were willing to hold
talks with the Dalai Lama at a place of his choice, and the Dalai
Lama agreed.
   However, the Dalai Lama says talks should be based on his June
proposal that China allow Tibet autonomy in domestic affairs. China
rejected this.
   ``We have received the Dalai Lama's proposals for the time and
place of talks. We are considering them,'' Wu Jinguang, a spokesman
for the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, said today. His
department oversees Tibet.
   The Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists and former
head of Tibet's theocratic civil government, fled to India in 1959
after an abortive uprising by Tibetans against Chinese rule.
Communist China sent its forces to take over Tibet in 1950, acting
on an ancient claim to sovereignty over it.
   From exile, the Dalai Lama has called on China to reduce its
heavy troop presence in Tibet and end alleged human rights
violations. He says the Geneva talks will not center on his return
to Tibet but on the future of the Tibetan people.
   The Dalai Lama on Tuesday said the talks would begin in January
in Geneva. But a second official at China's Nationalities Commission
said the matter was not settled.
   The two sides held official talks in Beijing in 1982 and 1984
without reporting any progress.

<HEAD>Settlement Ends Suit Against City Hall by `Hippies'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A couple accepted a $220,000 settlement and
ended their four-year, $7 million civil rights suit charging that
officials of New Port Richey harassed them and tried to run them out
of town.
   Erin Sullivan and Terence Brennan claimed city officials labeled
them ``hippies'' and ``troublemakers'' and violated their rights by
trying to silence their protests of city actions.
   The settlement, which included lifting a 4-year-old lien against
their home, came Wednesday just as the case was to go to trial in
federal court here.
   ``We fought City Hall and we won,'' Ms. Sullivan said.
   ``It does close the book, and I'm happy for that,'' added Brennan.
   Brennan and Ms. Sullivan moved to Pasco County in 1981 from
Berkeley, Calif.
   In their lawsuit, they contended that as early as 1982 they drew
the ire of then-mayor George Henry when they attended council
meetings and opposed some of the mayor's favorite projects.
   Former city employees, including the former police chief and fire
chief, testified in depositions that Henry wanted to run the couple
out of town.
   Among other things, the couple were cited for building-code
violations for things such as peeling paint and keeping a dead tree
in their yard.
   When Brennan and Ms. Sullivan sought to dispute the citations,
they were fined. Over time, the fines added up to a cap of $25,000,
the approximate value of their home. Liens were placed on their home
and the city even began foreclosure proceedings.
   Present and past officials of the city just north of Tampa
stressed that the settlement did not constitute an admission of
wrongdoing.
   ``I'm glad it's all over, and there was no admission of guilt,''
Henry said.
   Wednesday's settlement is the second time they have collected
from New Port Richey.
   In 1986, they filed suit claiming city officials violated public
records laws by withholding documents they requested for their
federal case. They won that case, and the city agreed earlier this
year to pay them $49,000 for attorney's fees. The case also cost the
city $22,000 for its own legal fees.

   Two Irish men and a woman convicted of
conspiring to kill Britain's top official in Northern Ireland were
given 25-year prison sentences today.
   Judge Swinton Thomas said Martina Shanahan, 22, and John McCann,
24, of Dublin and Finbarr Cullen, 27, of Maynooth conspired to
murder Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King and other unidentified
soldiers, politicians and judges.
   The three defendants were convicted Thursday by a 10-2 jury vote
after a two-week trial. They stood impassively in the dock today as
the sentences were read in Winchester Crown Court.
   Defense lawyers pledged to appeal the convictions and sentences.
   Police arrested the three defendants on Aug. 30, 1987, near
King's home in Wiltshire County, southern England.
   Prosecutor Alan Rawley said the tent at the trio's campsite
contained a list written on cigarette papers of politicians,
soldiers and judges in mainland Britain. They also had $8,000 in
cash, binoculars, a radio that could pick up police frequencies, and
a woollen hat with eyeholes, he said.
   The prosecutor said they had the addresses and auto license
numbers of people on the list, the names of military facilities, and
locations of offices of the governing Conservative Party.
   No evidence was produced in the trial that the trio belonged to
the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to drive the
British from Northern Ireland. No weapons or explosives were found.
   However, the British domestic news agency, Press Association,
reported that the three had a history of support for Sinn Fein, the
IRA's legal political arm.

   Republican George Bush said today Americans
should think about the words peace and prosperity as they vote for
president Nov. 8 and ask themselves whether ``dark clouds of
pessimism'' would be cast if Democrat Michael Dukakis wins the White
House.
   ``Now that we have peace and prosperity, we can't afford to put
them at risk,'' Bush told a group of business leaders.
   Comfortably ahead of Dukakis in the polls nationwide, Bush is
locked in a pitched battle in California for the big prize of 47
electoral votes.
   He told the businessmen that the Reagan-Bush administration has
dramatically cut interest rates and inflation and he recited a long
list of economic statistics to show that Americans are better off
now than they were eight years ago.
   In his remarks, Bush seemed to shelve his promise of a night
earlier that ``we're not going to be talking on the negative side''
in the closing days of the race.
   The vice president said Dukakis ``wants to torpedo the prosperity
we've worked so hard to achieve.''
   Bush said that when American go into the voting booth he hoped
they remember the words peace and prosperity: ``peace means you can
sleep at night knowing the world will still be there in the morning;
prosperity means you can sleep at night knowing that opportunity
will still be there in the morning.
   ``You know about our mornings,'' Bush said. ``But I ask you to
consider: What kind of morning would electing the liberal governor
of Massachusetts bring? Will it be gloomy?
   ``Will the dark clouds of pessimism and limited possibility
obscure our vision?'' Bush asked. ``Will we be able to hope for a
brighter day?''
   Saying that the nation cannot afford to put peace and prosperity
at risk, Bush added, ``The stakes for the cause of freedom around
the world are too high.''
   Addressing a crowd of celebrities Thursday night at the home of
entertainer Bob Hope, Bush said, ``I'm sorry Clint Eastwood isn't
here. Remember how he'd say, `Make my day.' Now my opponent says,
`Have a nice vacation' as the prisoners come out of the jail.''
   The audience laughed and applauded. Some of the best-known stars
of an earlier generation were on hand, including Gene Autry, Buddy
Ebsen, Robert Mitchum, Jane Russell, Danny Thomas, Esther Williams
and others, along with younger celebrities such as Jaclyn Smith.
   Bush was campaigning today in Los Angeles and Sacramento and then
stopping im Omaha, Neb., for a rally before a flight to Chicago.
   On Saturday, Bush will take a bus tour around the outskirts of
Chicago.
   Bush is being attacked by Dukakis, as well as by other critics,
for running a negative campaign _ a charge that now is being leveled
at Dukakis.
   ``We're coming down to the wire, Tuesday, 12 days from today,''
the vice president said Thursday night. ``Things have come along
well. We are not letting up.
   ``We're not going to be talking on the negative side anymore,''
he added, immediately launching into his criticism of Dukakis and
the furlough program for Massachusetts prison inmates.
   Bush concluded by saying, ``Now it's going to be a kinder and
quieter finish to this campaign.''
   Earlier in the day, Bush also voiced some reservations about the
way the campaign had been waged.
   In a white, circus-sized tent at Applied Materials Co., in
California's Silicon Valley, Bush said that ``some of the modern
campaigning with TV and spinning and sound bites might have gotten
out of hand.''
   Spinning is the term applied to efforts by campaign lieutenants
to shape the perception of their candidate's performance. Sound
bites are the 15 to 30-second snatches of a speech that wind up in a
television or radio broadcast.
   Bush, in his Santa Clara speech, accused Dukakis of ``trying to
scare the American people by putting Japanese flags'' in his
television commercials, and said the right way to gain world markets
for U.S. exports is by opening them, not shrinking from competition.
   He said Dukakis should explain ``why his thinly veiled comments
about foreign investment only mention Japan,'' which he said ranks
only third as a source of foreign investment in the United States.
   Footage of the Japanese flag appears in a Dukakis ad challenging
Bush's record as head of a commission that examined U.S.-Japanese
trade relations. The ad is running in Ohio.
   Bush said he would promote U.S. trade, but not with protectionist
measures.
   ``It doesn't make sense to stick our heads in the sand, as some
in the other party have suggested, and try to build walls around
America,'' the vice president said. ``It doesn't make sense to
launch a trade war and plunge America and the world into a recession.
   ``And it is beneath the dignity of the presidency, and of the
voters, to try to incite fear of foreigners as a cheap means of
winning a few votes,'' Bush said.
   Later, at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, Bush toured
a Holocaust museum with his wife, Barbara, and then told a courtyard
audience, ``We have no room in our communities for hidden Nazi
fugitives or war criminals. Every last one of them must be found and
brought to justice.''

<TEXT>
   With a banner headline reading ``So
Long Jacksonville,'' the 101-year-old Jacksonville Journal ceased
publication today.
   The presses at the Florida Publishing Co. began printing the
final 44,467 copies of the afternoon newspaper at about 10:30 a.m.
in a press run estimated to take about two hours, officials said.
   There were no ceremonies planned to mark the final edition.
Current and past employees are gathering tonight for a party, which
some are describing as a wake.
   The entire front page and three other full pages of the 116-page
final edition were devoted to the newspaper's closing.
   ``The Journal has had a long and distinguished record of service,
commitment and leadership,'' William S. Morris, the publisher, said
in the final.
   ``The Journal is no more, but its spirted love of this community
has not ceased to be,'' he added.
   The final edition featured a picture of workmen removing the word
``Journal'' from atop the building.
   The photo was taken by the Pulitizer Prize-winning photographer
Rocco Morabito, who retired in 1983 after 45 years with the Journal.
   The final page one also included a story about Morabito's 1968
winning photo, ``Kiss of Life.'' The picture shows a power-company
worker giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to another worker atop a
utility pole.
   The joint newsroom for editors and reporters for the Journal and
the morning paper, The Florida Times-Union, was quiet as the final
edition was put to bed. Several editors and reporters headed to the
pressroom to watch the final edition printed.
   ``It's like your pet has been ill for a long time and the day
comes when you have to put it sleep,'' said Henry Blumenthal, wire
editor, who was cleaning out his desk. Like all other Journal
newsroom employees, he will assume new duties at The Florida
Times-Union.
   Frederick Hartmann, executive editor, said there will be no
layoffs in the newsroom and any excess should be handled by
attrition.
   ``When you are a dinosaur, you don't want to die, but it is
inevitable,'' said Barbara White, the newspaper's religion editor.
   Morris had noted earlier the demise of afternoon dailies across
the country.
   ``More than 200 afternoon newspapers have ceased publication,
including 23 during the past year,'' Morris said.
   The Miami News, which began 93 years ago, has announced that it
will close if it is not sold by Dec. 31.

   Michael Dukakis rallied supporters at a church today with a
declaration that ``11 days is an eternity'' and time enough to catch
George Bush before Election Day. Bush suggested Americans would wake
up to a gloomy morning if Dukakis should be elected.
   Bush celebrated like the front-runner he is Thursday night at a
party at Bob Hope's house. But Dukakis also was upbeat at a rally
early today at a Baptist church in Kansas City, Mo..
   ``In politics, as you all know, 11 days is an eternity,'' Dukakis
said. ``There is time to do it.''
   He was introduced by the Rev. Wallace S. Hartsfield, who said
that during the Reagan administration there have been ``a few at the
head of the table who refuse to pass the bread.''
   Dukakis, who opened his remarks by saying ``I've got a little
preaching to do,'' promised Hartsfield things would change in a
Dukakis White House.
   ``We're not only going to pass the bread, but you're going to be
at the table,'' he told the predominantly black audience.
   Dukakis, who hosted a town meeting Thursday night in nearby
Independence, Harry Truman's hometown, said he was inspired by the
visit and confident he could, like Truman, pull off an upset.
   To win he will have to defy the polls much as Truman did in 1948.
The newest batch of surveys _ including one Thursday showing a
nine-point Bush lead _ range from eight to 15 points.
   Bush said Thursday night that he would not be ``talking on the
negative side'' in the closing days of the race, but that didn't
seem to last long.
   He told a business group in Los Angeles today that Dukakis
``wants to torpedo the prosperity we've worked so hard to achieve.''
   Bush said, ``Peace means you can sleep at night knowing the world
will still be there in the morning; prosperity means you can sleep
at night knowing that opportunity will still be there in the morning.
   ``You know about our mornings,'' Bush said. ``But I ask you to
consider: What kind of morning would electing the liberal governor
of Massachusetts bring? Will it be gloomy? Will the dark clouds of
pessimism and limited possibility obscure our vision?'
   Thursday night, at a stop in Kansas City, Dukakis sat for a
14-minute interview with Dan Rather on the CBS ``Evening News''
where he conceded that GOP advertising had hurt his candidacy.
   ``There's no mystery about why they put those ads on. They have
done damage. There's no question about that,'' he said.
   Dukakis suggested that Bush resorted to the commercials ``to
divert public attention from the fact that this administration has
probably had more corruption and malfeasance than any in recent
memory, if not in history.''
   The Democratic nominee was continuing his campaign in Missouri
today before heading to Michigan and later Boston. Dukakis' running
mate, Lloyd Bentsen, was focusing on California _ and its electoral
prize of 47 votes _ before returning to his home state of Texas.
   Bush was also targeting California before traveling to Nebraska
where he planned a joint appearance with Sen. David Karnes. The
Republican candidate faces an uphill battle with former Nebraska
Gov. Bob Kerrey for the Senate seat.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle was touring the
``Pennsylvania Dutch'' region and scheduled a series of appearances
at the state's high schools.
   The Republican ticket, according to an NBC News-Wall Street
Journal poll released Thursday, leads Dukakis-Bentsen 51 percent to
42 percent, considerably closer than the 17 points in a similar poll
done just after the Oct. 13 debate.
   The survey, conducted among 1,285 likely voters, had a margin of
error of plus or minus three percentage points.
   As he campaigned in the West, Bush said the Pacific nations
represent ``huge and growing markets'' for American goods, ``if we
don't turn and run away.''
   ``I will make sure that our trading partners continue to
understand that our markets are vital to their growth as well,''
Bush said. ``Free trade must be fair trade. A Bush administration
will keep the heat on.''
   But Bentsen, in a speech to the World Affairs Council in Los
Angeles, said that under the leadership of the Reagan
administration, the United States had become an international
debtor, dependent on foreign investors as it battles huge trade and
budget deficits.
   ``The United States must be able to compete not only militarily
but economically,'' Bentsen said.
   Dukakis, in the CBS interview, reiterated his populist view that
the Democratic ticket favors average Americans while Bush is the
candidate of the privileged class.
   ``I want the government of this country to be on the side of
average Americans and I think that's a fundamental difference
between me and George Bush,'' the Democratic nominee said.
   Meanwhile, the Dukakis campaign announced that it is doubling its
budget for Hispanic ads, targeting seven states with large Hispanic
voter populations.
   The campaign also is spending about $3 million _ 10 percent of
its media budget _ on black-oriented television and radio ads which
began three weeks ago.
   In five of the radio ads, former Democratic candidate Jesse
Jackson tells listeners, ``We have the power to make Mike Dukakis
president. Let's use it.''

<HEAD>New Hair Sample Drug Test Allowed In Custody Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug test that analyzes hair samples can be
used in a child custody battle in which a man claims his wife is
unfit because of cocaine abuse, an appeals court has ruled.
   Lawyers in the case said Thursday it is apparently the first time
that a party in a matrimonial case has received court permission to
have the other party undergo the test, called radioimmunoassay.
   The test uses radiation to determine what compounds have been
deposited during the hair's growth.
   Frank Burgel, the husband, ``is happy that the court has
recognized the importance that children will be raised in a
drug-free environment,'' said his attorney, Peter Bronstein.
   Three judges of the state Appellate Division, Second Department,
agreed with a lower court that the test is admissible in the process
of gathering evidence prior to trial.
   Their decision, returned Monday, did not address the issue of
whether such test results would be admissible during the trial.
   Two judges, in a dissenting opinion, recommended that a hearing
be held to determine the scientific reliability and validity of the
test.
   Burgel and his wife, Ninni, of Scarsdale, are in the midst of a
divorce and are both seeking custody of their children, an
11-year-old girl and a 9-year-old boy.
   Burgel, 40, a businessman, received permission in December from
state Supreme Court Justice John Marbach to have his wife submit to
the taking of two small hair samples.
   He charged in court papers that Mrs. Burgel had a cocaine habit
since 1982 that made her unfit to have custody of the children.
   Mrs. Burgel, 37, who initiated the divorce proceeding, has
admitted she used cocaine in the past, but says she stopped using it
several months before the custody dispute began.
   Burgel's motion said the radioimmunoassay results, combined with
the known average growth rate of human hair, could provide a
calendar or timetable of the subject's cocaine use.
   During the appeal of Marbach's ruling, Mrs. Burgel has been
ordered not to cut or treat her hair.
   Mrs. Burgel's attorney, Sanford Dranoff, said he agreed with the
dissenting judges that a hearing on the validity of the test should
be required.

   Three police homicide detectives have been
reassigned and could face suspension because of a loud belch heard
over Miami police radio several weeks ago, an official said.
   The department's communications computer, which automatically
records all transmissions, identified detective Ron Lemke's
walkie-talkie as the instrument used in the offense.
   Lemke was working a drug murder at the time, with homicide
detectives John Buhrmaster and Al Moreno. When confronted later, all
three denied knowledge of the belch.
   ``They were evasive. They denied it. They were embarrassed,'' Lt.
Mike Gonzalez said. Finally, they talked.
   The offense was not that serious, but the cover-up was
unacceptable, Gonzalez said. The department bounced all three out of
homicide and recommended a week's suspension without pay.
   ``Occasionally guys let their hair down and do childish little
things, but they've got to pay the consequences,'' he said.

   Lawmakers who say they were double-crossed by a
presidential veto are promising to revive legislation that would
protect federal workers exposing government fraud and waste.
   Howls of bipartisan outrage were generated Thursday after
congressional sponsors learned that President Reagan won't sign the
legislation that his Office of Management and Budget agreed in
writing to support.
   This is hardly the first time that a presidential veto has
stirred controversy in Congress, but the reaction was harsher this
time because Democrats and Republicans accused the administration of
breaking its word.
   Lawmakers said they relied on letters to sponsors by the deputy
director of the Office of Management and Budget, Joseph R. Wright
Jr., expressing the administration's backing of the legislation.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the chief Senate sponsor, said the
measure will be introduced again when Congress reconvenes early next
year. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, echoed the statement.
   Reagan, who said the version passed by Congress went too far in
protecting workers, said he will submit his own bill in January
before leaving office.
   But the 418-0 House vote and unanimous voice vote in the Senate
for the congressional version make it unlikely that a Reagan
alternative would prevail.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh raised constitutional objections
to the bill, which was designed to protect federal
``whistleblowers'' from retaliation by their superiors.
   The attorney general persuaded Reagan on Wednesday to ``pocket
veto'' the legislation _ let it die while Congress is out of session.
   Thornburgh told reporters Thursday that ``no one is entitled to
the protection of unconstitutional legislation.'' He contended that
the Justice Department consistently expressed constitutional worries
to lawmakers and never signed off on the compromise that passed
Congress.
   Asked if Wright had approval to deal with Congress on the
legislation, Thornburgh replied, ``I don't know.''
   It was unclear whether OMB and Justice Department officials knew
they were pulling in opposite directions, but congressional staffers
said they assumed Wright checked with other agencies before writing
of the administration's support.
   OMB spokeswoman Barbara Clay declined to discuss an apparent
internal rift, saying only, ``The decision has been made by the
president and we support the decision.''
   Lawmakers didn't buy Thornburgh's explanation that his department
expressed its unhappiness with the bill to Congress during ``any
number of exchanges.''
   ``It's outrageous conduct and has created a bipartisan explosion,
because it violates the basic understanding we need but now no
longer have ... that an administration's word is good,'' said Levin.
``There's going to be bipartisan hell to pay.''
   Rep. Frank Horton of New York, the chief Republican House
sponsor, said he backed the measure ``only when I was assured of the
administration's support.''
   Horton called Reagan's decision ``a reprehensible act ...
orchestrated after adjournment of the Congress to prevent an
override.''
   Grassley said the administration had ``signed off'' on the bill
before Thornburgh stepped in.
   ``We worked with the administration far too closely for
Thornburgh and company to now suggest there are unresolved
constitutional questions. ... But then this administration hasn't
exactly a sterling record where whistleblowers are concerned.''
   Chief House sponsor Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said, ``In 1981
President Reagan promised to protect employees who blow the whistle
on wrongdoing; now we know how cheap the president's words are.''
   Reagan said Wednesday the bill would have allowed employees ``who
are not genuine whistleblowers'' to manipulate the process to delay
or avoid proper discipline.
   ``I regret that the Congress did not present me with
constitutional and effective legislation to expand the protections
and procedural rights afforded to federal employees who report
fraud, waste and abuse they discover in federal programs,'' the
president said in a statement.
   ``The interests of both employees and managers should be fully
protected,'' the president said.
   Sponsors said the whistleblower bill was needed because the
Office of Special Counsel, established to represent the interests of
whistleblowers, was not doing its job.
   The bill was designed to reverse decisions of courts and the
Merit Systems Protection Board, a federal judicial agency, that made
it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases.
   The bill would have made the Office of Special Counsel an
independent agency and would have defined its role clearly as one of
protecting whistleblowers. The office now is part of the Merit
Systems Protection Board and at times it has acted against
whistleblowers who came to the office for help.

   President Raif Dizdarevic told
government officials today that nationwide unrest threatens
political stability, and he urged quick economic reform, an official
report said.
   ``Political and ethnic tensions have increased to such a degree
that the political security situation has seriously deteriorated,''
Dizdarevic told an emergency session of the collective presidency he
leads and its Cabinet.
   The collective presidency has nine members who represent regions
across the nation. Its rotating annual president functions as chief
of state.
   Economic and social problems have combined to prompt months of
anti-government demonstrations with calls for an overhaul of
Communist Party leadership and introduction of a multiparty system.
   
   ``The perspective of the exit from the economic crisis can not be
put off any longer,'' Dizdarevic was quoted as saying by Tanjug, the
official news agency. ``It is the final hour (in which) we direct
and concentrate all forces for final preparation of the economic
reform.''
   Communist leaders have faced hundreds of strikes in recent months
after eight years of economic crisis that have eroded the standard
of living. Annual inflation stands at 217 percent, and employment is
15 percent.
   At the same time, Serbian nationalist demonstrations have
heightened friction between Serbs and other groups in this fragile
confederation of republics.
   Only two emergency meetings of government leaders, both dedicated
to economic problems, have been held since World War II, in 1981 and
1985.
   Dizdarevic also appealed to the Soviet Union to help Yugoslavia
cope with its $1.7 billion deficit in trade with Moscow.
   The party's policy-making Central Committee held a session
earlier this month and pledged radical economic reforms, including
introduction of a market-oriented economy and stimulation of private
entreprise. The changes are expected to be adopted by Parliament by
the end of the year.

<TEXT>
   Residents with snow plows who are willing to help
clear their neighbors' streets for free will have to obtain some
pricey insurance and a city permit this year, or their good deed
could land them a fat fine.
   ``It's what the city attorney's office says we need to do to
protect the city,'' John Mrozek, director of the Denver Department
of Public Works, said Thursday.
   Mrozek unveiled city snow preparations this week, noting that the
city council hasn't financed plowing of residential streets despite
angry demands after a big storm last winter.
   What the city will do is let neighborhood groups chip in to hire
contractors for plowing, Mrozek said. But those contractors must
have permits and insurance.
   The new regulation is aimed at commercial plowing firms, but
Mrozek admitted that it covers anyone, even the neighbor down the
block with a plow blade on his Jeep who clears the road as a favor.
   ``We can't limit it to one certain segment; we have to open it to
anybody,'' Mrozek said. ``I have no idea whether it will discourage
somebody or not.''
   Mike Musgrave, an aide to Mrozek, said the city would exercise
some judgment about plowing permits, but it won't send squads of
inspectors out to nab people who give neighbors a hand.
   The rule may be clarified, said City Attorney Steve Kaplan.
   Insurance agents gave prices ranging from $350 to $1,260 a year
for the required liability, injury and property damage coverage of
up to $1 million per incident.
   It's a case of legality casting too long a shadow, said
Councilman Bob Crider.
   ``What happens, when you put something into the law and get the
city attorneys involved, they write all that stuff and it takes away
all the fun of life,'' Crider said.
   ``I don't want to say somebody should break the law. But if
somebody wants to clear the road in front of my house, I'd sure give
him a cup of coffee.''

   Sen. Dan Quayle, trying to ward off
complacency that might keep George Bush voters home on election day,
today campaigned through Pennsylvania Dutch county, saying, ``We're
not taking anything for granted.''
   Quayle was on a bus tour with a series of stops at schools and
rallies in the state, which is viewed as one of several close
contests between Republican presidential nominee Bush and his
Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis.
   ``It's still seen as a battleground state. We have a slight
lead,'' said Quayle adviser Ken Khachigian.
   Quayle's mission was to energize voters in light of predictions
voter turnout could be low and GOP worries that complacency could
dash the lead that Bush has been enjoying in the polls.
   Quayle was touring Republican strongholds as well as Democratic
areas that supported President Reagan in 1984. ``This area is
clearly a good Republican area and we're trying to beef up turnout
here,'' said Quayle adviser Jim Cicconi as Quayle arrived in
Lancaster.
   The vice presidential candidate was joined by Sen. Arlen Specter
and Rep. Bob Walker, both R-Pa., as he spoke to a gymnasium full of
children and high school students at Manheim Township High School.
   He urged the youths to join the fight against drug abuse and told
them if they wanted to go to college, ``No one will be denied that
opportunity in a George Bush administration.''
   On Thursday, Quayle joked that Dukakis can't figure out what to
be for Halloween _ a moderate, a liberal or just himself.
   ``If he dresses as a moderate, he scares the liberals in his
party. If he dresses as a conservative, nobody will believe it. If
he comes as he is, he scares the American people,'' the Republican
vice presidential nominee joked Thursday night at a rally here.
   Quayle's ostensible good humor capped a rough day on the campaign
trail marred by a traffic accident involving a bus in the
candidate's motorcade and a school van. Later, at the rally, Quayle
had to yell above the steady din of pro-Dukakis hecklers and his own
supporters who were trying to shout the protesters down.
   The accident en route to Bedminster, N.J., occurred when a bus
carrying Quayle's mother and aunt and staff members fell slightly
behind the rest of the motorcade and collided at an intersection
with a school van carrying three teenagers.
   Quayle later visited the emergency room where press secretary
David Prosperi said the students and their driver were being treated
for bumps and bruises but nothing serious.
   No one in the Quayle bus was hurt.
   Later, Quayle traveled to Syracuse where he encountered a
disruptive audience. During the candidate's speech, a man in the
front row stood, shook his finger at Quayle and shouted, even after
a pair of tall Quayle supporters stood in front of the demonstrator
with signs.
   At one point, two Secret Service agents came down off the stage
to stand within a few feet f the man, between him and Quayle's
lectern on the stage. Quayle supporters yelled at the man and tried
to cheer above other chanting and shouting by Dukakis supporters in
the crowd.
   The Indiana senator was unruffled in dealing with the situation,
but interrupted his speech several times to address the
demonstrators.
   ``We're glad to have you here and this is a free contry and you
have the right to freedom of speech, but so do I,'' he said.
   ``Sit down and enjoy the speech. It's going to be a great one,''
he told the shouting man.
   Then later, he said sternly, ``Despite what you may say, these
people are going to hear what I have to say.''
   The bus accident had delayed his earlier New Jersey appearance,
where Quayle used a satellite speech to AT&T employees to dramatize
his belief that ``America has a mission to make things work for
everyone.''
   He spoke at the AT&T control center for the digital long distance
network and his remarks to about 2,000 employees were carried via
satellite to 29 other AT&T facilties around the state.
   He said the company represents the technological changes of the
future, adding, ``Anyone prepared to lead us into the 1990s and then
into the 21st century must be prepared to harness this change _ to
capture its spirit, its momentum and its excitement so that we turn
challenge into achievement.
   ```America is the envy of the world ... because America has a
mission to make things work for everyone. We never stop trying to
improve our lives to improve our sociey, to build something of value
for generations that follow us,'' he said.

   Federal agents have obtained an arrest warrant
for financier Adnan Khashoggi in connection with fraud and
racketeering charges filed against him and deposed Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   Meanwhile, the Saudi Arabian businessman is believed to be
``lying low'' in a European country while he consults with advisers
about how he should respond to the fraud and racketeering
indictment, the newspaper said.
   The Times, citing unnamed sources, said officials believe
Khashoggi won't surrender to face the U.S. charges.
   The sources said the warrant was issued in an effort to find
Khashoggi before he relocates to a country without formal
extradition agreements with the United States.
   Sources close to Khashoggi told the newspaper the financier is
considering returning to his native Saudi Arabia.
   Although he believes he would ultimately be cleared of the
charges, the sources said, he is concerned about the possibility of
being arrested, jailed and extradited to the United States.
   An English-language newspaper in Saudi Arabia, Arab News of
Jiddah, reported Thursday under a Riyadh dateline that Khashoggi
``vehemently'' denies the charges. The newspaper declined to say how
it had received the statement.
   ``He is disappointed that a technical legal question involving
the scope of an injunction in a civil case to which he was not a
party has been converted into a criminal allegation in a totally
unprecedented manner,'' the newspaper said. ``He is confident that
when all of the facts are made public as the proceeding progresses,
his lack of culpability will become manifest.''
   The United States has extradition agreements with France, Britain
and Spain, the countries where Khashoggi currently maintains his
primary residences.
   No such agreement exists with Saudi Arabia, however.
   Khashoggi, whose wealth once symbolized the rising economic power
of the oil-rich Arab world in the 1970s, was once reported to be the
world's richest man. But his financial empire began to crumble amid
a pile of debt in the early 1980s.
   The U.S. government is now accusing him of acting as a front for
Marcos to help divert assets and hide Marcos' ownership of real
estate and valuable art.
   Meanwhile, Marcos' arraignment in New York was delayed Thursday
by U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan until a court-appointed doctor
can examine the 71-year-old former Philippine leader.
   Marcos' attorneys argued he was too ill to travel to New York for
the arraignment. However, his wife, Imelda, was ordered to appear in
New York on Monday.

   Court officials today postponed a hearing on
the government's $3 billion lawsuit seeking compensation from Union
Carbide Corp. for victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster.
   Lawyers for the U.S.-based company and the Indian government
appeared in the court of District Judge M.W. Deo to take up
pre-trial matters, but the court clerk said the judge was on leave.
   The attorneys agreed to meet again Nov. 26.
   At least 3,135 people died and 20,000 others were injured when
toxic methyl isocyanate leaked from the pesticide plant operated by
the company's Indian subsidiary. It was the world's worst industrial
accident.
   A high court has ruled that Union Carbide should pay $190 million
in interim relief to victims of the disaster on Dec. 3, 1984 at
Bhopal. However, both the company and government are appealing that
decision in Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Mass Atty Gen Blasts Police Cadet Training, But No Prosecution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts' attorney general today blasted the
training of cadets at a regional police academy, but said he planned
no prosecution of officials after 16 cadets were hospitalized
following rigorous training.
   Attorney General James Shannon concluded that the incident at the
academy at Agawam ``resulted from a massive failure in the method of
training police cadets by the Criminal Justice Training Council.''
   ``My investigation shows that individuals involved in the
training of Class 12, from top to bottom, failed woefully in their
duties,'' he said.
   However, Shannon added: ``I have concluded, based upon the facts
now known to me and upon the circumstances as they now stand, that
no criminal prosecution is appropriate in this case.''
   Shannon said there is no criminal statute that ``fairly fits ...
the facts and conduct here at issue'' and that ``none of the
instructors acted with the intent that any cadet be seriously
injured or harmed.''
   The attorney general's investigation was requested by North Adams
Mayor John Barrett III last month after 16 out of 50 cadets were
hospitalized in their first week of training at the police academy.
   The investigation was later widened to include a look into
allegations of financial and hiring improprieties at the
Massachusetts Criminal Justice Training Council, which runs the five
regional police academies, including Agawam.
   At a Statehouse news conference, Shannon recommended the
abolition of the Criminal Justice Training Council and a complete
revamping of training procedures, but he did not offer his own plan.
   Shannon, one of 23 members of the Training Council, said he took
responsibility for his own role in a chain of command that ignored
warnings of trouble. For example, Shannon said, there have been 12
ambulance calls to the Agawam academy in the past four years. ``That
should have indicated a problem,'' he said.
   Cadets at Agawam said they underwent 10 hours of pushups, laps
and other exercise on a few cups of water in their first day of
training, Sept. 19. Several cadets reported brown urine and
abdominal pains during the week; one cadet collapsed from heat
stroke on the first day.
   One of the hospitalized cadets, Timothy Shepard of Pittsfield,
became comatose and had to undergo a liver transplant in late
September. He emerged from the coma two weeks after his collapse
from heat stroke, but remained in serious condition today at a
Pittsburgh hospital.
   A state Public Health report concluded that all 50 cadets
suffered dehydration and muscle fiber breakdown from strenuous
exercise coupled with insufficient water intake.

<HEAD>Agency Approves 20 Percent Pay Bonus at Hard-to-Staff Airports</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new grafs 6-7, Journeyman, giving salary figures.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has gotten
clearance for a pay-increase plan designed to attract more
experienced air traffic control employees in the nation's three
largest metropolitan areas.
   The Office of Personnel Management approved a ``demonstration
project'' Thursday calling for the FAA to boost pay by as much as 20
percent for some employees at hard-to-staff air traffic control
centers in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago areas.
   The five-year experiment will determine whether incentives are an
effective tool in recruiting and retaining personnel, Transportation
Secretary James Burnley said.
   ``This project should make it possible for FAA to achieve full
staffing at facilities where living costs, highly complex operations
or other factors have made them less attractive locations for
employees,'' he said.
   More than 60 percent of the 2,000 employees eligible for the
bonus pay will be controllers, Burnley said. The rest are safety
inspectors and the technicians who maintain air-traffic control
computers and other equipment.
   Journeyman, or full-performance-level, controllers and some
inspectors at the nation's busiest airports make up to $60,683
annually in base pay, so a 20 percent salary differential would
boost their pay to as much as $72,819, FAA spokesman Fred Farrar
said today.
   However, he said not all controllers and inspectors receive that
much, and Farrar was not certain of the pay scale for technicians.
   The FAA said facilities chosen for the pay incentives include air
route traffic control centers at Chicago and New York, control
towers and terminal radar approach control centers at O'Hare

<HEAD>Commission Rejects Bid to Make Capone's Home a Landmark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bid to give landmark status to the home of
infamous Prohibition Era gangster Al Capone has been rejected by a
local review panel after pleas from Italian-American organizations.
   The 3-0 vote by the National Register Review Committee of the
Commission on Chicago Landmarks on Thursday is expected to be
appealed by groups seeking to place Capone's home on the National
Register of Historic Places.
   ``Memorialize Al and you stereotype all Italians,'' Carl DeMoon,
president of the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans, told
the committee.
   Giving landmark status to Capone's house would honor ``an image
we have tried to bury with him in his grave at Mount Carmel
Cemetery,'' DeMoon said.
   But Tim Samuelson, a program specialist for the landmarks
commission who nominated the mobster's South Side home, argued,
``History is the best weapon we have for putting Capone away once
and for all.
   ``His ghost continues to haunt the city. Chicago has vainly tried
to close its eyes and run away from Capone's ghost, but he has
remained in close pursuit, breathing down the city's neck and
tugging at its coattails,'' Samuelson said.
   DeMoon said the city's Italian community ``is both insulted and
enraged by this attempt to resurrect the fading memory of Al Capone,
Chicago's most infamous Italian-American.''
   An advisory committee of the Illinois Historic Preservation
Agency is expected to consider the issue Dec. 9.

   Health Minister Claude Evin today ordered a
pharmaceutical company to resume distribution of an abortion pill in
the interest of public health, and the company said it will comply.
   The firm, Roussel Uclaf, said it had no choice but to obey Evin's
order. It said it will resume distributing the drug to approved
abortion clinics.
   Roussel Uclaf announced Wednesday it was pulling the drug off the
market in response to an ``outcry of public opinion at home and
aboard'' from abortion foes and a threatened boycott of its products.
   The Health Ministry order was issued after Evin met with
executives of the company, which manufactures the RU 486 pill, also
known as Mifepristone. Roussel Uclaf is part of the giant West
German chemical group Hoescht, which has the majority share. The
French government has a 36 percent share.
   Roussel Uclaf said a ``debate on public morality'' which it was
not qualified to arbitrate led to the decision to withdraw the pill.
   The ministry said Evin summoned Perre Joly, a Roussel Uclaf vice
president, to his office to express displeasure with the company's
decision. It said Evin reminded him that while the company could
make its own decisions, Evin was responsible for public health.
   It said the 1975 law legalizing abortion in France must be
applied and that voluntary abortions ``constituted a right for women
in this country.''
   ``RU 486 is an advance because it does not involve use of an
anesthetic. The precautions for supply of this drug, solely in
specified (abortion) clinics, provides for all the required
indispensible guarantees of security,'' the communique said.
   ``With the interest of the public's health involved, Claude Evin
called on the Roussel Uclaf laboratory to resume distribution of RU
486 and the laboratory said it would do so,'' the statement said.
   Abortion foes, including the Roman Cathlic church, had welcomed
the company's decision to suspend distribution, while social
leaders, physicians from around the world and some politicians
opposed it.
   The drug's inventor, Etienne Emile Baulieu, said the pill has
been used in France on 4,000 women with a 95.5 percent rate of
effectiveness.
   On Thursday, thousands of doctors attending a convention in Rio
de Janeiro called on Roussel Uclaf to continue making an abortion
pill or pass the patent onto another manufacturer. The physicians
are attending the weeklong World Congress of Gynecology and
Obstetrics.
   Officials at the Health Ministry maintained the company acted in
order to protect its image abroad. Company officials said they had
been inundated with mail from France and abroard, especially the
United States.
   They said many letters threatened to boycott the company's
products.
   Andre Ulmann, a Rousse Uclaf official who helped develop the
pill, told a news conference at the Rio conference that the
threatened boycott would have cost the company substantial sums of
money, ``So we decided to stop making the drug.''
   He did not specify the costs involved.
   The pill blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone essential
in all phases of pregnancy. Researchers say it is effective in the
first seven weeks of pregnancy, particularly when used in
conjunction with a second product called Sulprotone, or
prostaglandin E.
   They said the drug was not a do-it-yourself, morning-after pill
that could be purchased at a supermarket and taken home. Its use
requires medical supervision. The government announced authorization
of the drug Sept. 23. It has also been tested for use in China and
India.
   Baulieu, also at the Rio meeting, said Roussel Uclaf had decided
to withdraw the drug for moral reasons.
   ``There is absolutely no medical basis for the suspension, which
comes despite the approval of the drug by both the French and
Chinese governments in terms of safety and efficiency, Baulieu said.
   ``The company is bowing to pressure from church groups and
conservative sectors of society, '' he said.

   Without the change Thursday, the club could have lost its food

banning discrimination on the basis of sex, race or religion in

   Earlier, the Chilton had notified the board that it would seek an

   On Tuesday, the all-male Tavern Club, which also had said it
planned to seek an exemption from the rule, announced it would begin

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police fired water cannons and
hurled tear gas today to disperse about 5,000 people who defied a
ban on a rally marking the 70th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's
independence.
   Helmeted police wielding batons swarmed through Prague's
Wenceslas Square to break up the crowd, which chanted ``Gestapo!''
as the police charged.
   Earlier, police arrested about 70 dissidents throughout the
country in one of the biggest raids on activists in years.
   At least 20 arrests were made in Wenceslas Square, and some of
those detained were beaten by police or had their arms twisted by
plainclothesmen as they were taken to buses and driven away.
   Authorities banned the independent rally, called a week ago by
the Charter 77 human rights group and four other independent
organization.
   But people came to Wenceslas Square at the rallying hour of 3 p.m.
   Hundreds in the center of the square began singing the
Czechoslovak national anthem when police gave the first order to
disperse, and thousands of onlookers joined in.
   Chants of ``Freedom!'' ``Long Live Freedom!'' and ``Masaryk!''
rang out. Thomas Garrigue Masaryk was the founder and first
president of the democratic republic of Czechoslovakia founded Oct.
28, 1918.
   Police moved down the square, hitting with batons onlookers who
refused to move.
   A Charter 77 activist, Ladislav Lis, cried out, ``In the name of
the Movement for Civil Freedom, hurrah!'' Thousands roared in
support.
   The Movement for Civil Freedom is a new civil rights organization.
   Police cleared the square in about 40 minutes and then moved
toward the National Museum, at the top of the square, where hundreds
stood on the steps watching the action below.
   Chants of ``Gestapo!'' went up as police trucks with water
cannons began spraying spectators.
   Tear gas billowed below a slogan atop the museum declaring
``Seventy (years). All power in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic
belongs to the working people.''
   The turnout surprised observers, who thought a police sweep of
dissidents and repeated warnings by authorities not to attend the
rally would deter people.
   In August, the square was the site of an unexpected protest by
thousands of people on the anniversary of the 1968 Warsaw Pact
invasion that crushed the liberal era of Communist-led reforms known
as the ``Prague Spring.''
   Anna Sabatova, an activist with the Committee for the Unjustly
Prosecuted, said about 70 activists were detained in the police
sweep, which she said began Thursday.
   Also Thursday, President Gustav Husak declared a limited amnesty
that could free some political prisoners, and Communist officials
held an official independence rally.
   The country's general prosecutor, Jan Pjescak, was quoted by the
Communist party daily Rude Pravo as saying the amnesty was the
biggest in years. About 7,000 prisoners are expected to go free and
160,000 other people will have charges dropped, he was quoted as
saying.
   The action seemed intended to pardon first-time offenders
convicted of many kinds of crime and many people who have left the
country illegally. It could provide a chance for thousands of
emigres abroad at least to visit their homeland if they have not
engaged in political activity in exile.
   Ms. Sabatova estimated, however, that only eight political
prisoners whose cases are followed by her group would be released.
   Hundreds of uniformed police and members of the paramilitary
People's Militia were on duty Thursday as authorities mounted their
rally in Wenceslas Square. It was the first official celebration of
the independence anniversary in four decades of communist rule.
   Addressing tens of thousands massed in organized groups behind
national flags, red banners and official slogans at Thursday's
rally, Prague Communist party head Miroslav Stepan said that
unofficial groups will not be tolerated as they are in neighboring
communist Hungary.
   Czechoslovakia's Communists have inched cautiously toward very
limited economic reforms in the wake of the more radical changes
initiated by Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union.
   But they have made clear they do not intend to allow political
pluralism.
   ``We won't allow the process of restructuring and democratization
to be abused by those who don't care for socialism and their
homeland ... those who are trying to destabilize society,'' Stepan
said.
   ``There is no dialogue here,'' he added.

   The Defense Agency will pay $16.7 million in
compensation to the families of 30 civilians killed in a naval
accident in July, agency officials said Friday.
   The victims were among 48 people aboard a sports fishing boat,
the 154-ton No. 1 Fujimaru, which was rammed sideways by the navy
submarine Nadashio near the mouth of Tokyo Bay on July 23.
   The incident sparked public outrage when photographs and
witnesses revealed that many crew members stood atop the sub and
watched people drown. Defense Agency Director Tsutomu Kawara
resigned in August to take responsibility for the accident.
   Kazuo Fujii, director general of the Finance Bureau, said the
agency has begun negotiating with relatives to determine the
specific amount of compensation to be awarded to individuals.
   He said the agency has also asked Fujimaru's owner, the Fuji
Shoji Co., to pay a share of the compensation if the Marine
Accidents Inquiry Agency rules the boat was partly responsible.
   The captain of the submarine also has come under fire for
reportedly waiting too long before attempting to avoid the collision.

   A former juvenile delinquent trying to change his
life was killed for his courage, police said, after he confronted a
man neighbors identified as ``Dread'' the crack peddler.
   Dalton Reneau, 17, was shot from a passing car just after
midnight Thursday on the same crowded street corner where he argued
with Dread the night before, said homicide detective Ron Ilhardt.
Reneau was trying to persuade the man to move his business out of
the neighborhood, Ilhardt said.
   Reneau died several hours later with bullet wounds in his chest
and legs. Police have issued an arrest warrant in the killing for a
man they identified as Francois Valmer, 31.
   The slaying first appeared to be the result of a territorial
dispute between rival drug pushers, but police then learned the men
standing with Reneau at the time of the drive-by shooting were
uninvolved in the drug trade, Ilhardt said.
   ``All the young men hanging out there work or go to school,'' he
said. They were trying to keep the neighborhood clean.''
   Reneau and his friends and Reneau's mother, Diane Fairweather,
had badgered the man to quit selling drugs in the area, Ilhardt said.
   The detective said the suspected drug dealer confronted Ms.
Fairweather Tuesday night and ``he slashed all four tires of the
lady's car, accusing her of calling police on him, and he and the
victim (Reneau) got involved in a heated argument.''
   Witnesses told police that a man they recognized as Dread
returned to the corner about 12:15 a.m. Thursday, riding in the
passenger seat of his own car. The driver's identity was unknown.
   ``He rolled up, turned the corner and opened fire on them all,
but he just hit Reneau,'' Ilhardt said.
   Reneau, who was to be buried Saturday, dropped out of school in
the eighth grade and had a juvenile delinquency record. Ilhardt said
the offenses were minor.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday there
will be no international Middle East peace conference if he wins the
election, and Arab leaders will have to reconsider their opposition
to direct talks with Israel.
   ``If I am elected it will become clear that this option doesn't
exist any more, and therefore the chances of resuming the
negotiations in the framework of Camp David will re-emerge,'' he
said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Arab leaders have refused his proposal to revive talks based on
the 1978 Camp David accords. Those agreements were the basis of the
1979 peace treaty with Egypt and envision limited autonomy for
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a
rebellion began Dec. 8.
   Shamir leads the right-wing Likud Bloc in Tuesday's election
against the Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who has
endorsed an international forum on the Middle East.
   In campaign speeches, Shamir has ruled out territorial
concessions to the Arabs and vowed to crush the uprising, in which
more than 300 Palestinians have been killed.
   He said he would ``not exclude'' the possibility of using greater
force against the rebellion, but stressed that Israel must coexist
with the 1.5 million Palestinian residents of the lands it captured
from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   ``We understand our limitations in using force because, after
all, we see the Palestinian Arabs living here as neighbors with whom
we have to live in the future,'' said the 73-year-old premier who
sat in an easy chair next to a blue-and-white Israeli flag for the
half-hour interview in his office.
   Efforts toward peace will suffer, he declared, if the PLO
declares Palestinian independence, which is expected at a Palestine
National Council meeting next month. the council acts as the
Palestine Liberation Organization's legislature.
   ``It will be harmful,'' said Shamir, who has vowed never to
accept a Palestinian state. ``It will become an additional obstacle
to improving the situation. After such extreme declarations, it will
become for them painful to go back, to retreat.''
   Shamir said the Arabs should not seek a ``one-sided solution''
and noted that no process work without Israel's approval.
   ``What is the use of these declarations if you don't have the
consent of Israel?'' he said. ``Therefore, they have to find a
concept that would be acceptable to both parties.''
   To break the impasse over Palestinian representation at peace
negotiations, the prime minister said Arab states should assemble a
temporary delegation that could discuss a plan for Palestinian
self-government.
   After agreement on an autonomy plan, he said, elections would be
held in the occupied territories to chose Palestinian negotiators
for a second phase of talks on the ``permanent status'' of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Jordan refused to participate in talks on Palestinian autonomy
between Egypt and Israelm, which broke down in 1981.
   ``Without Egypt and Jordan, I think it would be very difficult to
come to such an agreement,'' Shamir said. ``I cannot imagine any
agreement with the Palestinian Arabs without the help and active
participation of some other countries.''
   Shamir said an interview President Hosni Mubarak gave the Kuwaiti
daily Al Anbaa in January encouraged him to believe autonomy talks
with Egypt could be revived. The prime minister quoted Mubarak as
saying it had been a mistake to end the talks.
   Negotiations between Iran and Iraq on ending their 8-year-old war
are a precedent for direct talks between Israel and the Arabs,
Shamir said, but he would oppose U.N. involvement ``for the simple
reason that the United Nations represents a permanent anti-Israeli
majority.''
   In what he said would be his last interview before the election,
Shamir rejected suggestions that he does not really seek peace.
   ``I cannot be insincere,'' he said, smiling. ``It is beyond my
abilitities.''
   Critics have questioned his commitment even to the Camp David
process because Shamir, who was speaker of the Israeli parliament at
the time, abstained on the peace treaty with Egypt.
   Shamir's explanation is that he ``fully supported the effort of
making peace'' but abstained because the agreement called for
abandoning Jewish settlements in Sinai and returning to the 1967
borders with Egypt.
   ``I saw it as a dangerous precedent for the future,'' he said.
   In addition to not giving up captured land, Shamir said indicated
during the campaign he would build new Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories. The United States contends the 133 existing
settlements, with nearly 70,000 Jewish residents, are an obstacle to
peace.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the clock runs down on Michael Dukakis'
presidential hopes, a mixture of determined optimism and
helplessness envelopes the campaign staff jetting back and forth
across the country with him.
   Poll findings suggest his chances of victory over George Bush on
Nov. 8 are small.
   But the candidate's group of aides and advisers generally avoids
negative talk or fingerpointing over what went wrong in a campaign
that once held a double-digit lead in polls.
   ``Outside the fact we're all tired, the mood is excellent,'' said
Francis O'Brien, a senior adviser traveling with the candidate. ``We
wake up and say, `we're going to win.' That's what I believe.''
   Yet he adds: ``Now is it going to be hard? Are we behind? Yes.''
   Dukakis himself has seemed uplifted on occasion by his crowds,
which sometimes are quite large. He spoke with what seemed to be
fresh resolve in invoking Harry Truman's come-from-behind memory
this week.
   And his staff was positively euphoric, for the moment, after what
they considered a good interview Thursday night with Dan Rather on
CBS.
   But other times he has seemed startlingly emotionless and
reserved _ such as in his live interview on ``Nightline'' Tuesday
night.
   ``Dukakis is Dukakis,'' said campaign senior adviser Kirk
O'Donnell, ``He's as cool as they come.''
   O'Donnell was trying to persuade reporters that Dukakis'
colorless performance in that 90-minute network opportunity was not
the disappointment many observers believed it was.
   Dukakis has seemed a bit wan at other times, too. In an interview
on CNN, host Larry King asked: ``Do you think you've got a good
shot?''
   Dukakis replied simply: ``I think we've got a shot.''
   In the ABC interview, he said, ``I found it very difficult to
give people in this country a real sense of who the real Mike
Dukakis is.''
   ``You know, people have said I'm kind of cool and don't have
enough passion. ... It's very difficult to convey that.''
   Privately, some campaign staffers have revealed feelings and
frustrations _ and a hint of exasperation. One staffer, musing about
needing a vacation, said he would have plenty of opportunities in
another two weeks.
   Although open sniping hasn't broken out, there are private
suggestions that Dukakis himself has been unwilling sometimes to go
along with advisers ready to arm him with sharp, attention-getting
lines.
   A perception took hold that Dukakis had booted away a last
opportunity by a bloodless performance in his second debate with
George Bush in Los Angeles. The mood was reinforced after his
Nightline performance.
   Standing the next day in a room set up with telephones for
reporters to file their stories, O'Brien, the good-humored adviser,
felt the sting of a reporter's wit.
   ``Don't worry Francis,'' he was told playfully. ``Bob Beckel made
a lot of money after running a losing campaign.''
   It was a reference to Walter Mondale's 1984 campaign manager, who
has gone on to become a widely quoted analyst on television
commentary programs.
   Reporters constantly search for a metaphor for the Dukakis
campaign.
   Some saw one at a rally at Diablo Valley College in the suburbs
east of Oakland. Half a dozen buzzards circled lazily overhead
before Dukakis spoke.
   Others found it in Pueblo, Colo., where a brilliantly colored
hot-air balloon stood by the platform at a rally _ and fell to the
ground, deflating, after he spoke.
   On the campaign plane, aides point to polls showing single-digit
deficits as signs of encouragement.
   O'Donnell tried selling the line that the Nightline show was a
great success and represented a ``crescendo.''
   But the campaign took on an aimless quality the next day. Dukakis
stuck with his same stump speech, adding very little. As a
consequence, reporters had little new to write their stories about _
so many wrote about the campaign's dismal outlook.
   Aides insisted that the plan was to stick with the us-versus-the
rich economic theme, along with his continuing complaints about
nasty campaign tactics from the other side.
   ``What do you expect us to say at this point?'' said Steve
Engelberg, a traveling aide.

<TEXT>
   A man who escaped from a prison chain
gang in South Carolina 13 years ago was back in custody today after
his arrest by a special task force for federal fugitives, police
said.
   Kenneth Lee Davis told agents after his arrest Thursday that he
had expected to be arrested shortly after his August 1975 escape,
but became more comfortable about remaining free as time passed,
said Jeff Fortier, special agent with the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement.
   Davis, 43, along with brothers Joe and Bobby, owns Davis Brothers
Painting Inc., a paint-contracting company in nearby Daytona Beach.
   Davis was serving 20 years for armed robbery, burglary, larceny,
forgery and two previous escapes. The 1975 escape was the third for
Davis in less than four years, agents said.
   For the past 10 years, Davis has lived in a mobile home park
surrounded by retirees and families with children, Fortier said.
   He will remain in the Volusia County jail until he is returned to
South Carolina, Fortier added.
   The arrest was part of Operation Intercept, a program that
established a task force of federal, state and local police agencies
devoting their time exclusively to federal fugitive cases in several
Southern states.

   It's time once again for the semiannual ritual
of resetting America's clocks and watches.
   First, the magic reminder: ``Spring forward, fall back.''
   That means it's time to set the clocks back, as the nation
changes from daylight-saving time to standard time.
   Officially, the moment comes at 2 a.m. Sunday, which, by law,
becomes 1 a.m. Sunday in most of the nation. Most people, though,
will simply do the job before retiring Saturday night.
   Some areas won't have to change the clocks because they have
chosen to stay on the same time all year. Those are Arizona, Hawaii,
the part of Indiana located in the Eastern time zone, Puerto Rico,
the Virgin Islands and American Samoa.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syndicated news commentator Paul Harvey
buried Buffalo with nonexistent snow and then got snowed in himself
with complaints from angry residents.
   Harvey opened his 8:30 a.m. broadcast Thursday with an erroneous
report that the city at the eastern end of Lake Erie had received a
foot of snow. Although rural hamlets in the hills south of Buffalo
got several inches of snow overnight, the city's streets were clear.
The sky was sunny Thursday morning and temperatures were in the 40s,
in fact.
   ``We want a retraction,'' said Robert Carr, vice president of the
Buffalo Chamber of Commerce. ``It just furthers the inaccurate
perception that we're snowbound from Oct. 1 to April 1.''
   Mayor James Griffin also was angered by the broadcast and called
Harvey.
   ``I guess you take your weather pretty seriously,'' said John
Talmage, a researcher for Harvey.
   Harvey's office said the information came from a story by United
Press International. The UPI story, however, did not say there had
been snow in the city, only in an area several miles south of
Buffalo.
   The veteran broadcaster offered a correction on his 12:05 p.m.
broadcast.
   ``Well ... my usually reliable sources were not quite right,''
Harvey said, adding that now Buffalonians won't believe him when he
says two whales are trapped by ice in Lake Erie.

<HEAD>Soviet Editor Vows to Press For News on Political Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of a Soviet magazine has
promised to give the Soviet attorney general a list of 223 political
prisoners to be published in a respected emigre publication.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of Ogonyok magazine, told delegates at a
seminar in Barcelona that he ``promised to take the (prisoners) list
to prosecutors'' to get information. Korotich was referring to a
list of 223 names that Soviet exile editor Kronid Lubarski that his
respected Munich-based magazine Country and World was to publish
Sunday.
   Korotich's statement on Thursday, reported in the daily newspaper
El Pais, came one day after West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
in Moscow the Soviet Union had agreed to release all people regarded
in the West as political prisoners by the end of the year.
   Lubarski told the seminar there was some doubt about 56 of the
names on his magazine's list of political prisoners in the Soviet
Union, but assured them that the other 167 ``are in jail for their
political beliefs.''
   Both men were in Barcelona to attend a seminar on perestroika,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of economic and political
restructuring.
   Korotich, whose Ogonyok magazine has been prominent in battling
for greater public debate on important questions in the Soviet Union
under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost or openness, harshly criticized
the Soviet system of justice.
   Saying the matter of political prisoners in the Soviet Union was
being handled in a questionable manner, Korotich said: ``It is not
known in which way they (the prisoners) were arrested and some have
been released in an unknown fashion.
   ``If they were arrested illegally, then those who did the
arresting should be tried for it under the law,'' Korotich said.
``If they (the political prisoners) were released although they were
guilty, why was that done?
   ``If it is thought that the prisoners have committed some crime,
then let them be publicly tried for it so we can know what they are
accused of and (watch) with the penal code in our hand,'' Korotich
said.
   Korotich at one point compared the Soviet justice system to that
of the Spanish Inquisition.
   Lubarski told the seminar he was disappointed with the statement
by Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov in which he
indicated the Soviet Union only held two dozen political prisoners.
   ``There are at least 10 times that many political prisoners,''
Lubarski said.

   The Philadelphia Daily News endorsed Democrat
Michael Dukakis for president Friday, saying the Massachusetts
governor may lack excitement but Republican George Bush ``has no
character.''
   ``Michael Dukakis hasn't sold his soul,'' said the newspaper, one
of the city's two major dailies. ``He may not be exciting or
visionary, but he will do better on Central America, the defense
budget, Star Wars, issues involving human freedom (the ones that get
labeled `liberal' or `women's issues') and the Supreme Court, where
appointments are inevitable very soon.
   ``That's enough. We endorse Dukakis.''
   The paper said it ``could have endorsed the 1979-80 George
Bush,'' but ``not this one, not the guy who takes the lowest road
possible, who pretends, despite all the evidence, that J. Danforth
Quayle is not a callow moron, who thinks the CIA is more patriotic
than the ACLU, who is willing to play to any nasty nativist
electoral strain he can find, not the man who determines what he
believes by the polls. That man has no character.''

   The New York Post endorsed George Bush for
president on Friday, calling the Republican nominee ``a champion of
peace through strength, a believer in lower taxes and a free-market
economy.''
   It said its ``chief reason for backing Bush is that _ abroad and
at home, in foreign policy and in domestic affairs _ he will lead
the nation in the right direction.''
   The newspaper called Democrat Michael Dukakis ``a man of honor,
integrity and experience'' who has run ``a dignified and spirited
campaign.''
   ``But he is wedded to the liberal agenda of the 1960s,'' the
paper said. ``To deal with the challenges of the future, Dukakis'
instinct is to turn to the solutions of the past.''
   ``The only aspect of the Bush candidacy that gave us pause was
the presence on the Republican ticket of Sen. Dan Quayle,'' the Post
said, but it added that the vice presidential nominee ``has been
maligned way beyond his personal failings'' and ``is by no means as
poor a choice as has been claimed.''

<HEAD>Four Brothers Convicted of Running Cocaine Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four brothers accused of running a cocaine
operation that controlled half of Detroit's crack houses were
convicted today on drug and related charges.
   Larry, Billy Joe, Otis and Willie Chambers were among eight
people convicted by a U.S. District Court jury that had spent 13
hours over three days reviewing weeks of testimony.
   Prosecutors said the Chambers reigned over Detroit's largest
crack cocaine operation, supplying up to half the city's 1,000 crack
houses with the drug.
   ``They controlled the cocaine, they controlled the houses, they
controlled the workers who handled cocaine,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Lawrence Bunting said in closing arguments.
   No sentencing date was set by U.S. District Judge Richard
Suhrheinrich, who revoked bond for all the defendants.
   ``The court finds that this conspiracy is a threat, a serious
one, to this community,'' he said.
   Several former gang members testified during the trial the
Chambers used promises of excitement and big money to lure people _
many from the Chambers' hometown of Marianna, Ark. _ to Detroit.
Gang members said they were paid up to $1,500 a week, but also said
they were kept in line with threats of physical punishment and even
death.
   Defense attorneys throughout the trial had criticized prosecution
witnesses, saying they had been paid and promised immunity in return
for testifying against the gang.
   Larry and Billy Joe Chambers could face up to life in prison for
their convictions on operating a continuing criminal enterprise.
Larry Chambers also was convicted of illegal firearm possession,
cocaine possession and conspiracy. Billy Joe Chambers also was
convicted of cocaine possession and conspiracy. Both pleaded guilty
earlier to income tax evasion.
   Willie Chambers, whose case was heard by Suhrheinrich instead of
the jury, was convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion.
   Otis Chambers, Belinda Lumpkin, Jerry Lee Gant, Marshall Glenn
and Eric Lamar Wilkins were convicted of conspiracy. Elaine Coleman
Lucas was convicted of cocaine possession. They could face up to 20
years each in prison.
   Paul Lamont Young, identified in the trail as the recruiter for
Detroit-area gang members, was acquitted.

   Members of the Supreme Soviet today voted ``no''
for the first time to draft laws put forward by the executive
Presidium. The laws to increase government control over public
demonstrations still passed easily.
   The break in the string of unanimous votes indicated President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has had some success in his drive to
democratize Soviet society and encourage open debate.
   A total of 31 deputies voted against a decree by the body's
executive council, the Presidium. The measure gives broad powers to
paramilitary police to keep order at demonstrations. The number of
votes in favor was 1,348, with 24 abstentions.
   The Supreme Soviet's rubber-stamp practice also was broken on a
second decree passed by the Presidium on July 28. It requires
advance permission for public demonstrations and outlines fines and
jail terms for violators. A total of 13 deputies voted against the
measure, 1,368 voted in favor and four abstained.
   Both votes were by a show of hands.
   The Supreme Soviet also unanimously adopted a $795 billion budget
for 1989.
   The two decrees were the subject of extensive coverage in the
official Soviet press, with some articles saying they should be
amended.
   Activists complained that the paramilitary police, who have been
breaking up demonstrations in Moscow and several other cities since
the Presidium adopted the decrees, used brutal tactics.
   Pavel P. Goryunov, a Supreme Soviet deputy from the Estonian city
of Tartu, argued in a 10-minute speech that the decrees should not
be adopted at the national level, and that local government
councils, not the national Interior Ministry, should decide when to
use paramilitary troops to quell demonstrations.
   He was followed by two other delegates who spoke in favor of the
decrees, a Moscow subway worker and the chairman of the Kiev city
council.
   In introducing the measures to the Supreme Soviet's two chambers
_ the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities _ Tengiz
N. Menteshashvili, a Presidium secretary, said: ``Democracy is
impossible without strict legality and discipline.''
   He cited February riots in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait,
caused by a secession campaign by ethnic Armenians in the republic,
as an example of why the laws on maintaining public order are needed.
   But he held out the possibility the decrees might be amended in
the future.
   ``We still have to gain practical experience in democracy ...
then we can introduce amendments,'' Menteshashvili told deputies in
the Kremlin.
   Decrees are normally voted on as a package, and the scheduling of
separate show-of-hand votes on the public order laws indicated
opposition behind closed doors to the measures. The votes were
announced to the deputies.
   The Supreme Soviet approved the budget after trimming a projected
deficit of $58 billion to $55 billion.
   Deputies cut the projected deficit, the first ever acknowledged
by the Soviet leadership, by finding additional revenues.
   The budget calls for most new investment to move from the
traditional favorite, heavy industry, to improvements in the Soviet
standard of living.
   Soviet Finance Minister Boris Gostsev said Thursday the
government has been running a deficit for years because of losses by
state-owned businesses.
   Deputies were told the deficit was caused by both inadequate
revenues and unexpectedly high expenses. Specifically noted were a
$65 billion tax shortfall since 1985 due to an anti-alcohol campaign
and a $65 billion decline in revenues from oil sales, due to low
world prices.
   The official Tass news agency said legislators discussed the
spending plan ``at times, very sharply.''
   ``The debates were comprehensive and profound,'' Boris Kachura,
chairman of the planning and budget commission, told Tass.
   Legislators found possibilities for producing more consumer
goods, thus increasing government revenues by almost $2.4 billion.
   As part of the plan, several hundred factories manufacturing
machines and equipment will be retooled to produce consumer goods.
Most of the increased revenues will be allocated to reducing the
deficit.
   Yuri Maslyukov, head of the state planning committee, promised
dramatic improvements as the government shifts from its traditional
emphasis on heavy industry to improving the living standard.
   Maslyukov said farms will have two years to straighten out their
operations before facing ``elimination.''
   Central planning will be reduced by limiting the powers of
planning ministries, he said.

<HEAD>White Teen Assaulted By Blacks On City Bus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white teen-ager was tied up, assaulted and
robbed by a group of 20 blacks aboard a bus in an attack police say
was racial in nature.
   The victim, whose name was not given because he is a juvenile,
was on his way home from school Thursday when he boarded a Transit
Authority bus in the borough of Queens.
   A group of about 20 blacks were already on the bus when the
15-year-old got on, said Detective James Coleman, a police spokesman.
   ``They passed a rubber exit cord (on the bus) and one of them
ripped it off,'' Coleman said. ``One suspect was heard to say,
`Let's tie someone up.'''
   The teen-ager moved to the front of the bus near the driver but
the gang of blacks moved in on him, Coleman said.
   Several restrained him while he was tied up with the cord and
carried to the back of the bus ``where he was kicked in the head and
body, and ethnic comments were made,'' Coleman said. He said he did
not know exactly what was said.
   The suspects also allegedly stole $5 from the teen-ager.
   It was not immediately known what the bus driver did during the
assault or if there were any other passengers on the bus.
   The group of black youths got off the bus and fled, Coleman said.
The teen-ager, whose father is a retired police sergeant, was taken
to North Shore Hospital where he was treated for cuts and bruises
and released.
   The teen-ager reported the incident to police Thursday. The case
was given to the Bias Investigative Unit early Friday.
   Transit Authority spokesman Jared Lebow said the agency was
trying to locate the bus driver, who had not reported the incident.
   The assault is the second racial incident reported this month.
   On Staten Island, a group of black youths and several white men
exchanged racial slurs outside a bar Oct. 7. About a half-hour
later, Derrick Antonio Tyus, 17, was struck and killed by a car.
   Police are investigating to see if the racial incident and the
accident are linked. Black youths involved in that incident told
police they were being chased by several whites when Tyus was
accidentally struck by a car.

<HEAD>Soviet Role In Whale Rescue Emboldens Coast Guard To Seek New
Icebreaker</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Stranded Whales, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The use of Soviet icebreakers to help save two
whales trapped off Point Barrow, Alaska, is emboldening the Coast
Guard to again seek presidential approval to add one or more of the
polar ships to its fleet.
   In what has been a yearly ritual for a decade, the Coast Guard
asks the White House for $300 million to build a new icebreaker and
budget officials there always say no, most recently as late as two
weeks ago, according to sources.
   But that was all before two whales _ dubbed Crossbeak and Bonnet
by those taking part in a Herculean effort to save them _ became
trapped under Arctic ice a month ago and the United States called
upon Soviet icebreakers for help.
   ``The whales trapped in the ice have raised the spectre of what's
wrong with the American icebreaking fleet, and the answer is
everything,'' said Kurt Oxley, the House Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee counsel for Coast Guard and navigation issues.
   ``With only two, we have to use them sparingly,'' Oxley said.
``With four or five we could spread them out more evenly and
possibly have had one up there.''
   The United States actually has three saltwater icebreakers now.
Two are 399-foot sister ships _ the Polar Star and the Polar Sea _
both built in the 1970s and based in Seattle.
   A third, the Northwind, is a World War II-vintage spoon-shaped
hull stationed out of Wilmington, N.C., that is scheduled to be
decommissioned in January and relegated to the scrap heap.
   The Soviet Union, by contrast, has at least 16 icebreakers,
including four powered by nuclear reactors.
   ``The Soviet Union is an Arctic nation; they need that many,''
says Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., the Coast Guard's commandant. ``We don't
need that many, we're not an Arctic nation.''
   ``But we do need at least four polar icebreakers,'' Yost said.
``I think one will be all we can afford next year. Maybe we'll get
another one in the years beyond that.''
   Not if the pencil pushers in the White House putting together the
federal budget have their way. For every year dating back to and
including Jimmy Carter's presidency, they have rejected the Coast
Guard's yearly request for $300 million for a new polar ship.
   Several sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
White House Office of Management and Budget turned down the latest
request to include a new icebreaker in the president's proposed
budget for fiscal 1990 that begins next Oct. 1.
   With two Soviet icebreakers coming to the rescue of the two
whales this week, the Coast Guard has decided to make another stab
at it, the sources said.
   Yost would not confirm or deny that, but he said the world
attention focused on the fate of the whales has ``definitely been a
positive impetus toward us getting a new icebreaker.''
   ``Congress has directed that we build a new icebreaker, and now
it's just up to the Coast Guard and the administration to see if we
can fit one into the 1990 budget,'' he said.
   Congress in 1986 ordered the construction of two new icebreakers
by 1990 after a study by the administration concluded that the Coast
Guard should have a minimum of four _ and better yet five _ in its
fleet.
   But nothing has happened since then because of federal budget
deficits exceeding $150 billion each of the past three years and
bickering over whether the Coast Guard should build a new ship or
lease it from private companies as part of the administration's
``privatization'' goals.
   Over the past two years, the Coast Guard has spent $2 million
designing a new icebreaker. The agency estimates the cost of
construction at $300 million for one and $500 million for two, if
they are ordered at the same time.
   Even then, a new icebreaker will take a minimum of seven years to
build, Yost said.
   Meanwhile, Crowley Maritime Co. of San Francisco, which now
provides icebreaking services for oil companies operating on
Alaska's North Slope, has offered to build, lease and operate an
icebreaker crewed by civilians but commanded by Coast Guard officers
for $40 million a year.
   ``The Coast Guard was initially interested in our proposal two
years ago and it fit in perfectly with the administration's
privatization goals,'' said Tim Mills, a Washington attorney
retained by Crowley to push the venture. ``But then the Coast Guard
changed its mind. We've quit working on it.''
   The Polar Sea is now in Seattle in preparation for a resupply
mission to the Antarctic in January.
   The Polar Star is off Nova Scotia en route back to Seattle
through the Panama Canal after it was unable to break through the
ice-clogged Beaufort Sea west of Prudhoe Bay two weeks ago. It had
to head east through the Northwest Passage following the rescue of
two ice-stuck Canadian ships.
   Yost said the United States probably would have called on the
Soviet Union's ship for help in any case, since it was only 300
miles away and had open water most of the way to where the whales
were trapped.
   ``No icebreaker _ not ours, the Russians' or the Canadians' _
could have broken through from the West or East where the Polar Star
was,'' he said. ``And our Seattle icebreaker was 3,500 miles away.''

<HEAD>U.S. Asks Asians To Help Investigate Illegal Salmon Fishing Reports</HEAD>

   The State Department has asked Asian nations to
help investigate reports of widespread illegal salmon fishing in the
North Pacific, including the possibility the fish are being
``laundered'' through canning processors in Thailand.
   American fishing groups have told the State Department that the
Taiwanese, Japanese and perhaps South Koreans are catching the
salmon under the guise of fishing for squid. The salmon are unloaded
in Singapore, where they are frozen, or in Bangkok, where they are
canned and sold on the European market at roughly half the cost of
U.S. canned salmon.
   ``It is very well organized and we believe the Koreans are
involved as well,'' said Barry Collier, president of the Pacific
Seafood Processors Association. ``We believe all three countries are
laundering the fish in the same manner.''
   The Seattle-based processors association estimates that 22
million pounds of salmon, or 6 million to 7 million individual fish
worth about $18 million, have been illegally caught so far this year.
   The association, which represents 80 percent of the seafood
processors in Alaska and Washington state, fears the illegal catches
already are having a ``major negative impact'' on Northwest and
Alaska salmon runs and also are undercutting sales of U.S. canned
salmon abroad.
   U.S. processors export about $500 million worth of salmon
annually.
   ``The industry allegations are being taken very seriously by the
department and we are investigating them aggressively,'' Ed Wolfe,
the State Department's ambassador for oceans and fisheries, said
Friday.
   Wolfe is scheduled to talk with Japanese officials in Tokyo about
the reports of illegal salmon fishing next week. In addition, the
International North Pacific Fisheries Commission, comprising
representatives from the United States, Canada and Japan, meet in
Tokyo next week and Wolfe said he expects salmon will be discussed.
   The State Department two weeks ago asked the U.S. embassies in
Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Japan and South Korea to ask those
governments for assistance in the investigation.
   The cable to the embassies told the U.S. officials to stress the
``serious nature'' of the reports of illegal salmon fishing and that
if true, they represented a ``potential multimillion-dollar loss to
the U.S. industry.''
   The State Department has also asked the American Institute in
Taiwan to urge the Taiwanese to take steps to halt any illegal
salmon fishing.
   Last week, U.S. and Soviet negotiators in Moscow called for
``joint enforcement'' efforts by the two countries aimed at
disrupting illegal salmon fishing in the North Pacific.
   Wolfe declined to say what actions were contemplated, but added
the Soviets were ``very concerned'' about the North Pacific salmon
fishery.
   In the early 1980s, American fishermen had complained that
Japanese and Taiwanese fishermen were taking large quantities of
salmon in the huge drift nets they use to catch squid. The gear used
to catch squid can be similar to that used in harvesting salmon.
   Both Japan and Taiwan took steps in the mid-1980s designed to
outlaw illegal salmon fishing. Japan banned the importation of
salmon caught illegally by its squid fleet and Taiwan has a ban on
the export of salmon.

<HEAD>Task Force Urges Schools To Set Up Separate Units For Youngest
Pupils</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   School districts should create separate units
devoted to 4- to 8-year-olds to ease the undue academic pressure
that school reform too often has placed on young children, a task
force urged Friday.
   Recent reforms aimed at making students more accountable and
diligent may make sense for high school students but may be doing
more harm than good when applied to younger pupils, concluded the
26-member panel of the National Association of State Boards of
Education.
   The reform movement ``has fostered a competitive mentality for
our educational enterprise, with unfortunate consequences for early
segments of schooling,'' said their 55-page report, ``Right From The
Start: The Report of the NASBE Task Force on Early Childhood
Education.''
   ``If education is seen as a contest that pits children against
their peers, or a race against our foreign competitors, we risk
teaching very young children the wrong academic tasks before they
are ready, and we stimulate fears and pressure among parents,'' they
added.
   The report, released at the group's annual convention in Chicago,
was produced by a task force consisting mainly of state and local
school officials and early childhood education experts. The panel
met throughout 1988, holding hearings and visiting schools in
Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco.
   Its key recommendation was the creation of ``early childhood
units'' with enough autonomy to cater effectively to the special
educational and developmental needs of 4- to 8-year-olds.
   Such units might be entirely separate from existing elementary
schools, or schools might designate an early childhood unit director
responsible to the principal. Elementary schools might also set up a
team of one or more teachers who would coordinate the activities of
all teachers dealing with young children.
   Tom Schultz, the task force's staff director, said the reasoning
behind such separate facilities for the youngest pupils is that in
many elementary schools, the guiding educational philosophy tends to
be skewed toward the needs of older children, which too often leads
to inappropriate teaching methods and goals for younger students.
   ``An early childhood unit would help counter that pressure and
bring about more meaningful assessments and practices,'' Schultz
said in a telephone interview.
   In a forward to the report, task force Chairman Richard Owens
said: ``We heard disturbing testimony about the harmful effects of
increased testing on young children, about class sizes of 33
children in kindergarten programs, and about the difficulties Head
Start parents encounter as they seek to continue active involvement
in their child's education in the public schools.''
   ``We were equally concerned about reports of low salaries for
early childhood teachers, staff turnover rates averaging 40 percent
nationally in child care centers, and limited, uneven public funding
for early childhood services,'' said Owens, who is also president of
NASBE.
   Early childhood units, the task force said, should aim to foster
strong parent-school partnerships, coordinate their services with
other community agencies serving youngsters, provide training and
support for teachers and administrators, and respect students'
cultural and linguistic diversity.
   The report was the latest expression of concern over increased
standardized testing, ability tracking and rigid academic demands on
elementary school children in some parts of the country.
   Similar concerns were raised in the past year by groups including
the National Association of Elementary School Principals and the
National Association for the Education of Young Children.
   The report didn't single out any states or districts for
criticism. But Georgia, for example, now requires kindergartners to
pass a test to advance to first grade, as does Minneapolis.
   ``In many instances, these tests lead to labeling children as
failures at earlier and earlier ages, rather than finding and
building upon their strengths,'' the report said.
   It said the stress on academics and standardized testing means
the nation expects too little of elementary-age children because,
``using more appropriate methods and materials, children can deal
with richer and more sophisticated learning tasks than those
dictated by worksheets and drill-and-practice pedagogy.''

   Police said Friday they have no suspects and had
found no signs of forced entry into the oceanfront mansion where
Cornelius Vanderbilt III, distantly related to the 19th-century rail
baron, was found stabbed to death.
   Vanderbilt, 72, had been dead a short time when his body was
discovered in a first-floor hall Thursday morning by James Brunton,
37, who has shared Vanderbilt's home on Staten Island for five
years, police Lt. William Quinn said.
   Quinn said Brunton had been asleep upstairs and came down to
investigate noises.
   Vanderbilt headed Vanbro Construction Co., which he inherited
half a century ago.
   Vanderbilt's relationship to ``Commodore'' Vanderbilt, who left
Staten Island to make a fortune in shipping and railroads, was
through his grandfather, Cornelius Sr., who was described by the
Staten Island Historical Society as a distant cousin.
   The slain man's father, Cornelius G. Vanderbilt Jr., died in
April of 1941 at age 53, hours before he was to have appeared before
a grand jury investigating corruption in the paving industry. The
father was found in Richmond Creek, but an autopsy established heart
attack as the cause of death and police listed it as an accident.

   A former U.S. Marine charged in a
California murder spree confessed to helping dispose of a victim's
body, court documents show.
   Charles Ng's confession was reported in documents entered at an
extradition hearing Thursday. The provincial court hearing will
determine if there is enough evidence for authorities to extradite
Ng to California.
   Ng, 27, is accused in the slayings of 12 people between June 1984
and January 1985. Most of the charges involve sex-torture killings
at a rural cabin in Calaveras County east of San Francisco.
   San Francisco police detective Edward Erdelatz said in an
affidavit that he interviewed Ng in Canada about the murder of one
of the victims, Paul Cosner, a San Francisco car salesman.
   After he was advised of his rights, Ng said he had a meeting in
Cosner's car with Leonard Lake, who was also suspected in the
slayings, Erdelatz said in a sworn statement.
   ``Ng stated that Lake said he (Lake) had just shot Cosner, whose
body was in the car,'' Erdelatz said. ``Ng stated he then helped
Lake dispose of Cosner's body.''
   Lake killed himself in custody in 1985.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree To Jewish Cultural Center In Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has agreed to a ``joint
venture'' with American Jews for the opening of a Jewish cultural
center in Moscow, Jewish sources said Friday.
   Details of the project will be discussed next week in Moscow
between Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and Edgar
Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, the sources said.
   The decision, which contrasts sharply with decades of official
repression of Jewish cultural and religious life, reflects the
widesweeping changes undertaken by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
the Soviet society and economy.
   Until recently, the teaching of Hebrew and practice of Jewish
culture often resulted in jail terms on trumped-up charges ranging
from anti-Soviet propaganda to drug possession.
   An understanding in principle on the cultural center was reached
last May in talks Bronfman held with Soviet officials, including
Shevardnadze and Konstantin Kharchev, chairman of the state
committee on religious affairs, said the sources.
   ``The Soviets have given the green light for this joint
venture,'' said one source, who declined to be further identified.
What remains to be discussed are the funding and exact location of
the center, he said.
   The center will include a library, museum and rooms for
celebration of weddings, bar mitzvahs and other religious
ceremonies, the sources said.
   If the Moscow project is successful, similar centers will be
opened in Kiev and other Soviet cities, they said.
   The center will be run by Soviet, American and European Jewish
groups in a building supplied by the government, the sources said.
   The handful of synagogues allowed to operate in the Soviet Union
are run by the state under close supervision.
   The agreement is the latest in a series of changes affecting the
lives of the estimated 2.5 million Jews living in the Soviet Union.
Authorities allowed some 12,000 Jews to emigrate this year, up from
the 8,700 allowed to leave last year and a significant increase over
the estimated 900 exit visas granted in 1986.
   The easing of restrictions also has affected other ethnic and
religious minorities, who are enjoying greater freedom under
Gorbachev.
   The changes also have extended to Soviet relations with Israel,
which Moscow cut off in 1967. An official Soviet delegation went to
Israel last year and an Israeli consular team is in Moscow now.

<HEAD>Robb's All-American Image Bruised By Battle For Senate In Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE TAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles S. Robb _ Marine, LBJ's son-in-law,
two-term governor _ is still expected to run away with the U.S.
Senate election in Virginia, but his all-American image has been
battered by attacks from his Republican opponent.
   Maurice A. Dawkins, a 67-year-old black lobbyist and retired
minister, has bruised Robb with questions about associating with
alleged cocaine-users and about a state gambling investigation.
   ``For the governor of Virginia to permit cocaine dealers and
cocaine users to carry on under his nose, well, it's not wisdom,
it's arrogance,'' Dawkins said at a campaign debate.
   Robb, often mentioned as a future presidential candidate, accused
Dawkins of using ``character assassination of the basest sort.''
   The level of nastiness in the campaign is unprecedented in
Virginia, where political high spirits usually are leavened by
patrician gentility.
   ``Both candidates have been diminished, even the likely landslide
winner,'' said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political
scientist.
   But Robb's problems do not end with Dawkins' attacks from the
right. On the other side, Jesse Jackson forces were angry at him for
not backing Jackson's presidential bid and for suggesting that the
civil rights leader play a limited role in the presidential
campaign. Jackson won the state's presidential primary in March.
   Robb's nomination was likened to a coronation. A handsome former
Marine Corps officer, he was known only as former President Lyndon
Johnson's son-in-law when he ran for lieutenant governor in 1977,
but four years later he led a sweep of Democrats into the state's
top three offices, ending 12 years of GOP rule. He would be
Virginia's first Democratic senator since 1972.
   Dawkins, meanwhile, has raised a relatively tiny amount to
finance his campaign, has laid off all but one staff member and
blames his troubles on racism and the news media.
   Dawkins was the last of four Republicans to seek the nomination,
and his victory at the state GOP convention in June was seen by some
party leaders as a token gesture to steal the thunder of Virginia
Democrats, who are expected to nominate Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder,
another black, for governor next year.
   Dawkins' only other political race was an unsuccessful bid for
the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in 1985.
   Robb has a strong record of fiscal soundness to please
conservatives. He appeals to moderates for opening positions of
power in state government to blacks and women.
   He has used his big lead in the polls to take some potentially
unpopular stands, including possible support for a tax increase to
control the deficit.
   ``Don't expect me to do everything that you are going to think is
in your short-term interest,'' Robb said. ``Assume I'm serious
enough about solving some of the problems that whatever your
favorite program is, I don't care what it is, think of that as being
in peril.''
   At the start of the Senate campaign, Robb was the target of a
noisy demonstration staged by Jackson supporters at the state
Democratic convention.
   More troubles followed. By Labor Day, Robb was fielding questions
about published reports that, while governor, he attended parties in
Virginia Beach where cocaine was used.
   A subsequent story said Robb's social ties to people who were
targets in a police investigation of illegal gambling hampered
investigators, who allegedly were told not to mention Robb in their
official reports.
   Robb has denied seeing anyone use cocaine and said he did not
interfere in the gambling investigation. But the allegations gave
Dawkins ammunition to question Robb's judgment.
   Dawkins also has accused Robb of having a plantation mentality
toward blacks and has urged black voters to try the GOP for a change.
   While Robb's image has suffered, campaign polls this fall show
his support ranging from 56 percent to 66 percent. Dawkins,
meantime, has drawn from 12 percent to 19 percent.
   Robb, with $2.7 million in fund-raising, has continued to
campaign as if the election were tight. Dawkins has raised less than
$200,000 and stopped campaigning for almost two weeks this fall to
devote more time to seeking money.
   At a news conference last week, Dawkins blamed the press and, to
some extent, racism for his troubles. He then walked out, refusing
to answer questions.
   Dawkins' campaign ``has redefined what a political disaster is,''
said Sabato.
   But the cocaine party and gambling probe stories have tarnished
Robb's squeaky-clean image and could affect any ambitions he has for
higher office, Sabato said.
   ``You never say never, but I think he's certainly been damaged,''
Sabato said. ``I think he's been hurt.''

<HEAD>New Airline Collision Avoidance System Mistakes Ships for Planes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airliners testing new collision avoidance
systems sometimes have been unable to tell the difference between an
oncoming plane and a Navy ship sitting in the water below, a Federal
Aviation Administration official said Friday.
   The problem is with electronic signals being sent out by Navy
ships, said Joe Fee, manager of the FAA's airborne collision
avoidance and data systems branch.
   Despite the testing difficulties, however, Fee said the problem
can be corrected before mandatory Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance Systems are installed on all larger U.S. passenger
aircraft beginning late next year.
   The systems, which are designed to automatically alert pilots
when another plane is near, will be required on all planes carrying
more than 30 passengers in the United States by the end of 1991. The
system reads signals from transponders aboard other aircraft and is
designed to supplement, not replace, air traffic control systems on
the ground.
   The problem with ship signals was first reported in the current
issue of the electronics industry newsletter Military Avionics.
   The Times Union & Journal of Jacksonville, Fla., reported Friday
that a Piedmont airliner testing the equipment last year found that
the system went haywire as the plane was landing at Jacksonville
International Airport, warning the pilot that he was in close
proximity to five other aircraft.
   It was picking up signals from ships at the nearby Mayport Naval
Station, the report said.
   Fee, in a telephone interview, said the problem probably can best
be corrected by having Navy ships emit a signal that gives their
altitude _ sea level _ which currently is not a part of the signal
emitted by the Navy's IFF, for ``identification, friend or foe,''
system.
   Most airplanes emit signals that give their altitude, but some
smaller ones do not, so their signals would be identical to those of
Navy ships. The problem would be most obvious at airports that are
near Navy installations, such as Jacksonville and Norfolk
International Airport in Virginia.
   ``It's kind of a nuisance thing that we think can easily be
fixed,'' Fee said, adding that some other minor improvements still
need to be made in the system before regular installations begin.
   The FAA already has set standards for the collision alert system,
and has been trying them out on a handful of aircraft flown by
Piedmont, United and Northwest airlines. The Northwest test is still
under way.
   Three companies manufacture the collision alert systems, which
are expected to cost in excess of $100,000 each to install on more
than 3,000 aircraft: Bendix-King of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.; Honeywell
of Phoenix, Ariz.; and North American Rockwell's Collins Division in
Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

   Jack de Manio, a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
broadcaster for 34 years who was renowned for his rich, husky voice
on a breakfast-time news show, died Friday at the age of 74.
   De Manio died in St. Stephen's Hospital after a long illness,
said his wife, Loveday.
   He began his career as an announcer on the BBC's worldwide radio
service, and won fame during 13 years with the ``Today'' news and
current affairs program. He left the show in 1971 because, he said,
``I am tired of getting up so early in the morning.''
   De Manio was the first journalist to get a radio interview with
heir to the throne Prince Charles in 1969, and was notorious for
frequently giving incorrect time checks.
   He moved from ``Today'' to his own afternoon show, ``Jack de
Manio Precisely,'' which was replaced after seven years by a program
on the day's proceedings in Parliament. He retired from radio in
1979.
   De Manio wrote two books, ``To Auntie with Love'' in 1967 and
``Life Begins Too Early'' in 1970, and contributed to the satirical
magazine Punch and other periodicals.

spokesman said Friday.
   About 3,000 delegates had been expected at the four-day
convention of the Association of British Travel Agents opening
Monday, but just under 1,700 have registered, said association
spokesman Martin Symington.
   The PLO's London office sent letters to all prospective delegates
appealing to them to stay away, and threatened to mobilize 2 million
Moslems in Britain into boycotting travel companies that attended.
   ``We do not take lightly attempts to belittle or ignore the
sufferings of our people,'' the PLO letter said, referring to the
11-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Jerusalem consists of a Jewish sector and an Arab sector annexed
after Israel captured it in the 1967 Mideast war. Most Western
governments do not recognize it as the capital.
   The convention was to have been held in Torremolinos, but the
venue was switched because a new convention center in the Spanish
resort had not been completed, Symington said.
   ``It's obviously disappointing that there are fewer people
attending this year,'' Symington said.
   ``We understood the reasons for delegates not going as there have
been problems of a political nature,'' he said. ``But Jerusalem was
the only place which met our convention requirements when we had to
change venues.
   ``To have pulled out would have been a political gesture and we
are an apolitical body.''

   If flying in an airplane makes you unbearably
dizzy, David Barlow will spin you in a chair until the room dances.
If a subway ride makes your heart race, he'll give you coffee to
simulate the sensation of panic until you overcome it.
   Barlow, a psychologist who teaches at the State University of New
York at Albany, was among the 420 experts and phobics gathered
Friday for a weekend convention on the fear of fear itself, also
known as anxiety attacks.
   The objective of the ninth National Conference and Training
Institute on Phobias and Related Anxiety Disorders is to find a
salve for discomfort widely suffered but not entirely understood.
   Barlow knows of what he speaks. About 10 years ago, he was under
the stress of a new job when he panicked at giving a speech. He
cured himself by jogging and orating at the same time to simulate
and overcome the breathlessness of sudden anxiety.
   He developed this technique into a treatment in which the
physical sensations of anxiety and panic are recreated, based on the
theory that people who suffer anxiety attacks are hypersensitive to
their bodily reactions. As a consequence, these people monitor
themselves, vigilantly waiting for another panic attack. When
attacks occur, an interior dialogue rages: Is this pounding heart
just a healthy muscle or is it the irrational foreboding of some
unknown disaster?
   Patients at Barlow's clinic are taught to reinforce rational
thoughts over the irrational fears.
   Estimates of how many Americans suffer from crippling anxiety and
phobias range from 2 million to 12 million, according to the
National Institute of Mental Health.
   Anxiety attacks were believed for a long time to be a heart
condition. Now, psychologists recognize that these experiences can
lead to phobias _ irrational, excessive and persistent fears.
   Phobias focus on specific situations that cause anxiety, such as
flying, subways, crowds or driving. There is the dizzying panic of
vertigo that can strike on a mountainside or an escalator, or the
loss of voice at having to speak in public, the No. 1 fear,
according to Jerilyn Ross, president of the Rockville, Md.-based
Phobia Society of America.
   Her organization is sponsoring the convention with Massachusetts
General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.
   The most devastating phobia is agoraphobia _ a fear of being in
public. Seeking to avoid the panic attacks that come when they are
among others, agoraphobics shun society, sometimes keeping to their
homes for decades. Only since the 1970s has serious attention been
paid to finding ways to relieve it.
   Treatments for anxiety and severe phobia include gradually
exposing the patient to the experience they fear, teaching them
breathing exercises to reduce the hyperventilation related to panic
attacks and sedatives.
   Women suffering from anxiety often retreat into depression. For
men, alcohol often is a way to cope. Studies show that 50 percent to
60 percent of alcoholic men began drinking to soothe anxiety, Barlow
said.
   One of the convention participants is Lisa D., a 33-year-old
lawyer who once felt the only secure place in the world was her
bedroom. It began when she was 17 and her stepfather abandoned the
family. One day the industrious, gregarious student panicked on a
ride to the beach.
   ``It was just the most uncomfortable, frightening feeling, a
feeling like you're short of breath, shaking all over. A sense that
you're just going to lose control. Time freezes and speeds up at the
same time and you just want to get to a safe place,'' recalled Lisa.
   Soon it became difficult to drive a car or even walk down the
street.
   She fought back and got herself to the University of Maryland,
where a full life there distracted her. But three years ago, with
her career under way, Lisa began panicking again. By then she had
read about agoraphobia and knew what was wrong. Lisa called a hot
line and was referred to a clinic for phobics.
   Although the attacks have ceased, Lisa is not entirely free, she
said. ``I don't think I'll ever be 100 percent comfortable about it,
but I'm able to say I'm not avoiding life because of it.''

   President Reagan outlined his unfinished
foreign policy agenda today, saying his successor should maintain a
strong defense, support the Contra rebels and pursue the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   In remarks prepared for delivery to the World Affairs Council, a
non-partisan foreign study group, Reagan said those steps were
essential to safeguard America, and Western civilization, from the
worlds' ``archvillians.''
   But Reagan also predicted that if his course of ``peace through
strength'' is maintained, a new strategic arms accord with the
Soviet Union is attainable ``in the next few years.''
   The president, while boasting of the improvement in U.S.-Soviet
relations that brought forth a treaty banning an entire class of
nuclear weapons during his administration, said much work will be
left to his successor.
   Responsibililty, he said, also falls on the voters, who on Nov. 8
will ``make decisions that will affect the world and our foreign
policy consensus for a great long time to come.''
   Reagan did not mention Vice President George Bush, the GOP
candidate, or his rival, Democrat Michael Dukakis, by name.
   ``Whatever the future may hold, it is safe to say: we have come a
long way and this is a portentous time,'' Reagan said.
   ``Let us remember that great steps have been taken in the last
few years, steps to safeguard against archvillains _ not to mention
the blowing up of the world. Of course, let us not be satisfied, and
certainly not smug. But let us be appreciative of what has happend
and determined to build on that progress,'' Reagan said.
   ``Change, indeed, is inevitable,'' Reagan said. ``No one should
doubt the instability of the present situation in Eastern Europe, in
which an artificial economic and political system, long imposed on
these people against their will, is more and more exposed as
bankrupt and discredited.''
   Calling the ``new degree'' of tolerance and experimentation under
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev welcome, Reagan also said that
``Moscow's handling of the growing drive for self-determination
within its European empire will be a vital test for us, of how deep
is the transformation of Soviet foreign policy in a new era.''
   He said the United States should hold to a strategy that ``means
not only maintaining our defenses and vigorous diplomatic
engagement, but also candor about and to our adversaries, support
for freedom fighters around the globe, and encouragement of human
rights and democratic reforms within the Eastern bloc.''
   The president called on Congress to ``give up the double
standard'' of supporting freedom fighters in one part of the globe
and not another. ``We must support the Contras'' in Nicaragua, he
said.
   On his space-based nuclear missile defense plan, known as SDI,
Reagan said, ``We must aggressively pursue the research, development
and testing.''
   ``Now is the time to redouble our efforts, not cut them back,''
he said, Congress, in the current fiscal budget, has mandated cuts
in the president's requests for the program.
   On the nation's defenses, Reagan said, ``We must keep our entire
defense structure strong,'' arguing that the ``enormous sacrifices''
that have been made to rebuild the military have only begun to ``pay
handsome dividends in peace initiatives across the globe.''
   Reagan's foreign policy speech came as he made his last
pre-election swing through his home state, where he was attempting
to enlist California and its bounty of 47 electoral votes for
Republican presidential nominee George Bush.

<HEAD>NATO Ministers Urge New Short-range Arms, Belgium Balks at Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers ended talks
Friday with a call for modernizing short-range nuclear weapons, but
Belgium refused to endorse a report laying out proposals for the
program.
   ``I see no hesitation,'' said U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci. ``We are going ahead on a step-by-step basis toward
modernization.''
   However, Belgian Defense Minister Guy Coeme told reporters that
his nation's center-left coalition government abstained from
endorsing the ministers' report on short-range weapons.
   ``Assuming any commitment now would be premature,'' he said.
   The issue is controversial in Europe, where the front-line
weapons would likely be targeted in a conflict.
   Despite Belgium's abstention on the report, Carlucci and the
other defense chiefs of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said
Friday in their final statement that the alliance needed the
short-range nuclear arms in its arsenal. Their statement made no
mention of Belgium's hesitation.
   The short-range weapons have received new attention since the
United States and Soviet Union signed a treaty in December to
eliminate all intermediate-range land-based nuclear missiles.
   Most NATO nations want to extend the range of short-range, or
tactical, weapons up to the treaty limit of 300 miles.
   ``For the foreseeable future, NATO requires diversified,
survivable and operationally flexible nuclear forces in Europe
across the entire spectrum of ranges,'' the ministers said at the
end of their two-day talks at the Hague.
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said the ministers made no
decisions on specific weapons systems this week.
   British Defense Minister George Younger said such decisions will
be taken as early as next year.
   The ministers' secret report, prepared earlier by their staffs,
calls for a new, longer range air-to-surface missile that could be
fired at Soviet air defenses from a NATO warplane. It also backs
U.S. work on replacing the Lance surface-to-surface missile, which
military analysts say will be obsolete in 1995.
   Details of the report became known when the London-based Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament released a summary prepared by the Belgian
Defense Ministry.
   The defense chiefs meet twice a year to plan nuclear strategy.
Fourteen of NATO's 16 members take part, with Iceland attending as
an observer. France operates outside NATO's military command.

   A poll published Friday said Liberal Party leader
John Turner won the two campaign debates, in which he and Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney had angry exchanges about the new
U.S.-Canadian trade agreement.
   The agreement, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, has become the
dominant issue in the Nov. 21 general election. It would phase out
all remaining tariffs over a 10-year period, and Turner said it
``will reduce us ... to a colony of the United States.''
   Ed Broadbent of the socialist New Democratic Party joined Turner
and the Conservative prime minister in the six hours of televised
debates, the first half in French on Monday and the second in
English the next evening.
   Broadbent also opposes the trade agreement.
   According to the poll, conducted by Environics and published by
the independent Globe and Mail of Toronto, 46 percent of those
familiar with the debates said Turner won, 19 percent chose Mulroney
and 10 percent favored Broadbent.
   Free trade was judged the most important election issue by 76
percent of those surveyed. Environics said the poll was based on 811
interviews and the margin of error was 3.4 percent.
   A Gallup poll that covered only Tuesday night's debate, published
by the Toronto Star, had 72 percent favoring Turner, 17 percent for
Mulroney and 11 deciding Broadbent won.
   The last Gallup poll before the debates found 40 percent for the
conservatives, the New Democrats in second with 29 percent and the
Liberals with 28 percent.
   That outcome probably would give Mulroney a parliamentary
majority.
   On Thursday, Mulroney said his rivals were being ``shameful and
dishonest'' in their attacks on the trade agreement.
   Turner, whose party has been a dominant force in Canadian
government through much of this century, said in the debate the
agreement reverses 120 years Canadian of resistance to U.S. pressure.

   The French drug RU 486 blocks pregnancy after
conception by interfering with a hormone that is essential to the
maintenance of pregnancy.
   The hormone, progesterone, is secreted normally during the latter
half of the menstrual period, said Dr. Irving Spitz, the director of
clinical research at the Population Council in New York, who is
studying the drug.
   ``One of the major effects of progesterone is to mature the
lining of the uterus so the egg can be implanted,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   Researchers had been searching for such a drug for more than two
decades, Spitz said. ``This is the first drug to be found that could
actually block the action of progesterone,'' he said.
   When progesterone's action is blocked, the uterus sheds its
lining. Any egg that might have been fertilized and implanted in
that lining is shed along with the uterine lining.
   RU 486 itself terminates pregnancy in about 75 percent of women
who use it during the first six weeks of pregnancy, Spitz said. To
boost the drug's effectiveness, doctors also prescribe a
prostaglandin, one of a group of hormone and hormone-like chemicals
in the body.
   The prostaglandin causes uterine contractions. The combination of
RU 486 and the prostaglandin is effective in about 95 percent of
women during the first six weeks of pregnancy, Spitz said.
   The drug's manufacturer recommends that it be taken in one dose,
followed three days later by a dose of prostaglandin, Spitz said. In
France, the drug is given only at abortion clinics, so that doctors
can monitor its effectiveness. The drug is not available over the
counter.
   Doctors will want to counsel the 5 percent of women in whom the
drug is not effective, he said. And some women who take it will
bleed excessively.
   The entire process of terminating pregnancy is usually complete
in seven to 14 days, Spitz said.
   Spitz said he is not aware that anyone in the United States has
taken steps to market the drug. To do so, a company would be
required to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   It would likely take at least several years before such an
application would be approved, Spitz said.
   Hoechst Roussel Pharmaceuticals in Somerville, N.J., which is
affiliated with the drug's French manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, said
Friday it had no plans to study or market the drug.
   Gynopharma Inc., also of Somerville, had been rumored to be
negotiating to market the drug in the United States. It has since
denied that it has plans to do so.
   Laura Giles, spokeswoman for Gynopharma, said Friday that the
company has not negotiated with Roussel Uclaf and is not petitioning
the FDA to allow marketing of the drug.
   Spitz said that RU 486 blocks progesterone by interfering with
progesterone ``receptors'' on cells in the uterus.
   ``It works very similar to a lock and key,'' he explained. ``All
hormones work on receptors. The receptor is the lock; the hormone is
the key.''
   The drug causes nausea and vomiting in 13 percent or 14 percent
of women who use it, he said. It sometimes causes bleeding and pain
as well, but those are ``normal accompaniments of the abortion
process,'' Spitz said.

<TEXT>
   For most of the 45 Americans present,
Friday's ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the departure of
the International Brigades from the battlefields of the Spanish
Civil War was the last hurrah.
   ``It's probably the last watershed when such a gathering could be
held,'' said Steve W. Nelson of Truro, Mass., the 85-year-old
commander of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade of U.S. volunteers who
fought on the side of the Spanish Republic in the 1936-39 Civil War.
   The unveiling of a bronze sculpture of David looking down at
Goliath by New York artist Roy Shifrin was the centerpiece of a
ceremony presided by Barcelona's Socialist Mayor Pasqual Maragall in
honor of the Oct. 28, 1938, departure of International Brigades
veterans from the conflict that many saw as a prelude to World War
II.
   About 300 former Brigades members from 20 countries attended the
ceremony.
   The monument and the cost of the ceremony were underwritten by
contributions from, among others, Pete Seeger, Ed Asner, Allen
Ginsberg, Leonard Bernstein, Greogory Peck, Woody Allen, Harry
Belafonte, Studs Terkel, Kurt Vonnegut and Gloria Steinem. The city
of Barcelona provided the land.
   As the Barcelona city band played, Nelson said the sculpture was
``a symbol for the people to recall the great struggle of the
International Brigades who helped to delay a major part of the
Second World War.''
   The brigades were the idea of the Comintern or Third Communist
International to provide support for the Second Spanish Republic
following the nationalist rebellion of Gen. Francisco Franco in July
1936.
   Franco's troops received men and materiel from Nazi Germany and
Italy.
   Historians estimate 35,000 to 50,000 volunteers, many with no
formal connections to the Comintern, fought on the losing side,
defending the Second Republic in the war that ended with a victory
by the Franco forces in April 1939 and a subsequent 36-year
dictatorship.
   Nelson said of the 3,000 Americans who fought on Spanish
battlefields, some 300 are alive today in the United States. Another
800 died in the war.
   Bob Reed, 73, of Seattle marched in the Oct. 28 farewell parade
50 years ago in Barcelona.
   ``That was really a magnificent display of feelings,'' he said.
``The people were giving us flowers, the kids were riding on the
shoulders of the brigade members. It gave us a feeling of not losing
the war but of coming out with renewed determination.''
   Civil War historian Hugh Thomas says Soviet dictator Josef Stalin
decided to withdraw the Brigades from Spain when he ``despaired of
being unable to form an alliance with France and Britain against
Hitler'' following British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's trip
to Munich in September 1938.
   The withdrawal of the Brigades was a gesture of goodwill toward
Nazi Germany that led to the signing of a non-agression pact between
the two nations a year later.
   Gabriel Jackson, professor emeritus of history at the University
of California at San Diego, told the U.S. veterans veterans that for
the surviving members of the International Brigades, the restoration
of democracy in Spain after Franco's death in 1975 was ``like a
victory 40 years later.''
   ``None of us would have believed there could have been a change
to democracy without another bloody revolution in Spain,'' said
Mosess Fishman, 75, of New York.
   Oct. 28 is also the sixth anniversary of the 1982 landslide
victory that swept the Socialists to power in Spain in general
elections for the first time since the outbreak of the Civil War.
   Steve Nelson said much of the 1950s McCarthy-era backlash against
the Lincoln Battalion veterans _ 60 percent of whom were either
members of the Communist Party or sympathizers, he said _ had
subsided.
   ``Young people are fascinated by the subject. There isn't a day
goes by at our New York office that we don't get calls or letters
from students or other people writing books about the subject,'' he
said.
   Bob Reed took advantage of the visit to continue his trip into
the past, to the fishing village of Malgrat de Mar on the
Mediterranean coast where the troop ship carrying him to Spain in
1937 was sunk a mile offshore by an Italian submarine.
   ``We went there cold,'' Reed said, ``but a young lady at the
tourist office was delighted to meet people she had read about in
history books.''
   Reed and several other survivors met with the mayor and
discovered that the bodies of six victims of the wreck, including
possibly an American, were buried in the Malgrat de Mar cemetery.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Bush Hiding ``In His Little Cocoon''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis derided George Bush
as hiding ``in his little cocoon'' on Friday and defended his own
ridiculed ride in an Army tank, saying the Reagan administration was
trying to cut tank production.
   Dukakis has been interviewed on a series of network television
programs recently as he tries to make up ground in the polls, and he
accused his Republican rival of avoiding such encounters as the
election nears.
   ``Mr. Bush is out there in his little cocoon. They won't let him
out,'' Dukakis said. ``We're taking our case directly to the
American people.''
   Dukakis displayed a battling-back demeanor at a large and raucus
rally at a college outside Detroit, just a few miles from his Sept.
13 ride in an Abrams M-1 tank. That ride has been mocked in
television commercials by Bush.
   ``Let me tell you why I was in that tank factory,'' Dukakis said
at the rally in the crowded fieldhouse at Macomb Community College.
   ``I care about those people. I care about what they're making,''
the Democratic presidential nominee said. ``I'm deeply concerned
about this administration's plans to cut back on tank production
while spending billions and trillions on Star Wars.
   Dukakis also jabbed at Bush for a remark the vice president made
while watching Soviet tank maneuvers in Europe.
   ``I am very concerned,'' Dukaks said, ``when a vice president of
the United States who wants to be president comes back from Europe
and says to the American people, `I'd like to bring some of those
Soviet mechanics over here to tell American workers what to do.'''
   His paraphrase of Bush's words brought boos from the crowd in the
town where tanks are manufactured.
   ``I don't think we need any Soviet mechanics telling American
workers how to produce,'' Dukakis said.
   He also pointed to a series of problems and accidents at nuclear
facilities at Savannah River in South Carolina, Rocky Flats in
Colorado and Fernald, Ohio. He pledged to ensure nuclear production
facilities are not a threat to workers or communities.
   Dukakis appeared in Michigan with Gov. Jim Blanchard, who said he
thought Dukakis was improving everywhere. Dukakis claimed the same,
saying: ``It's tightening up here in Michigan _ it's tighting up all
over the country. You can know it, feel it and sense it.''
   Top campaign official John Sasso told reporters that polls taken
by the campaign showed Dukakis gaining nationally this week and
drawing close in the important state of California.
   Independent polls have shown national Bush leads of eight to 15
points, but Sasso said ``there is measurable movement this week'' in
Dukakis' direction. He declined to give exact numbers.
   Sasso contended that Dukakis is getting across his argument that
Bush has run a harshly negative campaign to avoid addressing major
issues.
   Dukakis was continuing his 11th hour strategy of television
interviews, and in Michigan he sat for an NBC-TV session to be aired
next week.
   He also has purchased several blocks of 5-minute network prime
time.
   Dukakis began his day in Kansas City, Mo., where he spoke to a
small crowd in the basement of the predominantly black Metropolitan
Missionary Baptist Church, pledging strong action _ by backing
international sanctions _ against apartheid in South Africa.

   Having problems with the hands on your
grandfather clock? Afraid you'll be an hour early for everything
this Sunday?
   Fear not. There's help for the time-impaired on the eve of the
annual switch from daylight-saving time back to standard time _
provided you can get to Manhattan in time.
   An upscale watch retailer said Friday it would turn back the
hands of timepieces free of charge this weekend, on anything from
wristwatches to alarm clocks to grandfather clocks.
   ``Anything. Whatever you want turned back, we'll do it for you,''
promised Kristen Hoppmann, spokeswoman for the Tourneau watch
company.
   The service is available at Tourneau's four Manhattan locations _
where the company sells watches that run from $150 to $150,000 _
even if your favorite timepiece came from your local discount house.
   ``It doesn't have to be one of ours. We'll take care of it
anyway,'' she said.

   Ralph Martino had a short career at AT&T. So
short, in fact, that the company was still announcing his arrival
the day after he quit.
   Martino set a new standard for revolving-door employment this
week when he became the vice president in charge of AT&T's
1,000-member computer sales force, and then returned to his old

   ``He started working Monday morning and he left Tuesday
afternoon,'' Dick Muldoon, a spokesman for American Telephone &

decision was personal and it was not because he was dissatisfied

   AT&T executives were still telling securities analysts about the
high-level appointment as late as Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal
reported Friday.
   International Business Machines Corp. said Martino, 38, was on
special assignment to David M. Thomas, president of the National
Distribution Division in Montvale, N.J. He worked previously in
IBM's Applications Systems Division in Valhalla, N.Y., overseeing
software development.
   ``All I know is he left and after one day he decided to return.
He does not want to be interviewed,'' IBM spokesman Douglas DeLay
said.
   Muldoon added: ``He was very well respected _ at both companies.''

<HEAD>Pinochet Warns of Marxist Resurgence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARICA, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet said Marxists are
regaining strength and likened the nation's political situation to
the days before his military coup 15 years ago.
   The right-wing army general went on the political offensive for
the first time since he lost an Oct. 5 referendum to extend his term
until 1997.
   ``The situation we find ourselves in is without doubt delicate,''
Pinochet told about 800 supporters Thursday night in this provincial
city. ``It would be fatal and insincere to try to hide it.
   ``I see with much concern that the same political formulas that
in the past dragged the country into an unprecedented crisis are now
returning,'' Pinochet said. ``What's even more serious is that they
are (promoted by) the same people who destroyed our fatherland, our
democracy just 15 years ago.''
   Pinochet led a September 1973 coup that toppled the elected
government of President Salvador Allende, a Marxist, during
widespread economic and social disorder. Allende died in the coup.
   ``The causes of the confrontation of Chilean against Chilean
cannot be allowed to repeat themselves,'' Pinochet said. ``We have
to realize the dangerous time in which we live and call on
patriotism to overcome this situation.''
   He said the twin dangers were growing terrorism and
Marxist-Leninism.
   Gabriel Valdes, a leader of the centrist Christian Democrats, the
country's largest party, discounted Pinochet's remarks as a sign he
remains ``in shock'' from the referendum's outcome. ``He continues
to be wounded by the defeat,'' Valdes told reporters in Santiago on
Friday.
   Other opposition leaders, however, have said a hard line by
Pinochet is designed to provoke street demonstrations or other
opposition that could be used in an effort to justify repression.
   In the referendum, Chileans rejected a proposal by Pinochet and
the other military commanders that he remain in power until 1997.
About 55 percent voted ``no'' and 43 percent voted ``yes'' with the
remainder of votes voided.
   On this week's tour, Pinochet said the vote showed the good faith
of his military regime and allowed a reaffirmation of the
eight-year-old constitution.
   Under that document, the defeat forces Pinochet to call an open
election, planned for December 1989, and hand power over to the
winner in March 1990.
   Pinochet has pledged to turn over power, but he had not
explicitly said he would not run himself.
   The opposition is pressing for constitutional changes, including
a quicker departure of Pinochet from the presidency. They say some
amendments are also needed to ensure full democratic powers for a
future elected government.

   First lady Nancy Reagan has been honored for her
efforts urging women to take early steps to battle breast cancer.
   Mrs. Reagan, who recovered last year, received the 1988 Betty
Ford Award on Thursday.
   ``I know how hearing the word `cancer' or `malignancy' can just
absolutely freeze you with fear,'' Mrs. Reagan told an audience of
more than 2,000 people. ``But that fear should never keep you from
facing up to the need for mammograms'' for detection.
   Former first lady Betty Ford, who also recovered from breast
cancer, presented the award.
   Jill Eikenberry, a star of the NBC-TV series ``L.A. Law,'' also
was honored by the Susan G. Komen Foundation, the event's sponsor.
Mrs. Eikenberry, who had breast cancer two years ago, was recognized
for ``Destined to Live,'' a television special on the subject
broadcast earlier this month.

   Prince Charles, who's made a habit lately of
roasting London's skyline, found a new way to have a go against
post-World War II architecture.
   The heir to the throne wrote and starred in a 75-minute
documentary in which he dons a hardhat, takes the controls of a
crane and gleefully wields a wreckers' ball against a condemned
multistory parking lot.
   Charles stirred controversy earlier by saying builders have done
more damage to London than Hitler's air force. He returned to that
theme in the British Broadcasting Corporation film intended for

   Retired actress Helen Hayes gave
mixed reviews of her latest performances on a lecture tour.
   Miss Hayes, 88, told an audience at Purdue University ``I cannot
do without you,'' but said earlier Thursday at a news conference
that her stand-up gig made her a little nervous and she wanted to
stay home and tend her roses.
   ``Old age is not something I've staved off, it's something I've
achieved,'' she told the crowd of 3,000. ``I'm having a ball.''
   ``I cannot bear to be parted from a live audience. You've been my
very best friends for 80 years and I cannot do without you.''
   The actress said earlier: ``I haven't got used to it, the
nervousness. This is my fourth lecture and I have another next week
and then I'll not do any more. I'm also lazy. I don't like the
travel part. I want to tend my roses and stay home.''

   The first American woman to climb Mount
Everest said Friday she left a Susan B. Anthony dollar on the summit.
   ``When I reached the top, I did not think of being the first
American woman as I happened to achieve my personal goal,'' said
Stacy Allison, 30, of Portland, Ore.
   Allison, a carpenter, reached Everest's 29,028-foot summit on
Sept. 29 after a 10-hour climb. Last year storms forced her to turn
back at 27,224 feet. ``There was really no difficulty,'' she said.
``Women are equally strong like men. They are good decision makers,
too. Really I did not see any difference between men and women.''
   Asked why others had failed, she said: ``The cause was not
because of anything else except that the teams (which included
women) had not been in a position due to unfavorable weather on the
mountain.''
   On Oct. 2, Allison's teammate, Peggy Luce of Seattle reached the
top.
   ``This was my first expedition. I feel incredibly fortunate ...
(and) very lucky,'' Luce said.
   A Japanese housewife, Junko Tabei, was the first woman ever to
climb Everest in 1975.

   The hospitalization of police cadets from a state
academy exposed a brutal training regimen hidden from public
scrutiny despite many warning signs, but no one will be prosecuted,
the state attorney general said Friday.
   Attorney General James Shannon said his investigation found a
``top-to-bottom'' failure by the state to protect the cadets, most
of them from small-town police departments.
   He said he could find no statute under which to press charges,
that there was no evidence of intent by State Police trainers to
harm the cadets and that the ``diffusion of responsibility'' made it
unfair to prosecute individuals.
   But Shannon said the chief of the agency responsible for the boot
camp-like training should resign or be dismissed.
   ``The failure began with a bureaucracy that paid little or no
attention to the end product of its paper-shuffling: the care and
training of human beings,'' Shannon concluded.
   ``Instead, like the three monkeys of the legend, and despite the
existence of cause for alarm, the training bureaucracy saw no evil,
heard no evil and spoke no evil.''
   The investigation was limited to one class of the police training
academy in Agawam in western Massachusetts, one of 11 operated by
the state Criminal Justice Training Council. The class, which began
Sept. 19, included 50 cadets from local police forces seeking
certification as full-fledged police officers.
   The academy and its methods came under scrutiny when cadet
Timothy Shepard collapsed, slipped into a coma and had to undergo a
liver transplant at a Pittsburgh hospital, where he has regained
consciousness but remains unable to speak.
   At least 10 other cadets were hospitalized for ills stemming from
intense exercise and dehydration, the report said. One cadet was
quoted by the attorney general as saying his urine was ``as brown as
Hershey's syrup.''
   According to a Springfield doctor who coordinated the medical
response, at least 16 cadets were admitted to hospitals.
   Shannon's report documents a grueling regimen of ``modified
stress training'' and unrelenting exercise, defended by academy
officials as necessary to prepare for the rigors of police work.
When a cadet failed to keep up, the entire class would be punished
with extra push-ups or other exercises.
   ``I expressly reject the contention that exercising cadets ...
until they drop can meaningfully be termed `training,''' Shannon
wrote.
   Shannon said at a news conference that the officials involved
should have known there were problems at the academy.
   According to the report, Agawam Fire Department records show 12
ambulance runs to the academy from 1984 to this year to assist
trainees. Eleven calls required taking a cadet to a hospital. ``That
should have indicated a problem,'' Shannon said.
   He said responsibility belonged with the state troopers who
conducted the class, the directors of the academy and the 23-member
Criminal Justice Training Council, of which he is a member.
   Shannon told reporters that he did not believe Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, who appoints the council, bore any blame.
   He said Gary Egan, the council's executive director, who took a
paid leave of absence starting Wednesday, should ``either resign or
be removed immediately.'' Egan's phone number in Wellesley is
unlisted.
   Shannon did not spell out how he thinks training should be
conducted, saying he hoped that issue would be addressed by separate
investigations being conducted by the Legislature and the governor's
office.
   His report detailed the physical training that took up most of
the first day of a class in February as an example. A videotape made
that day documents 2{ hours of morning training, showing that the
group performed 188 push-ups and that some cadets did more as
punishment.
   Investigators noted that most cadets had just two water breaks
during the day, taking a single 3-ounce cup of water.

<HEAD>FAA Presents Timetable for Smoother Operations at Chicago Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration presented a
detailed timetable Friday for acting on 100 measures to improve
operations and reduce traffic-control errors at Chicago's busy
O'Hare International Airport.
   The lengthy document was submitted to Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
who had criticized the agency two days earlier for sending Congress
a vague and inadequate report on plans for the nation's busiest
airport.
   Simon met with FAA officials to discuss their latest report and
then told reporters he was satisfied with the agency's efforts.
   ``This action plan we now have really means the beginning of the
end of a significant threat to air safety at O'Hare,'' Simon said.
``Concrete actions are going to be followed. We have dates. We have
specifics.''
   The Senate passed a resolution earlier this month instructing the
FAA to submit a detailed report on its immediate and long-range
plans to end what Simon called an ``air-traffic control crisis at
O'Hare.''
   Its controllers have had 30 flight-handling errors so far this
year, compared with 12 in all of 1987 and their previous record of
22 in 1986.
   The FAA report listed 100 specific measures to improve safety and
operations at O'Hare ranging from hiring additional journeyman, or
full-performance-level controllers, to repainting the lines on
runways to make them more visible.
   It said a program approved Thursday by the Office of Personnel
Management providing a 20 percent pay increase to employees at
hard-to-staff facilities in three metropolitan areas _ Chicago, New
York and Los Angeles _ should more than double the number of
experienced controllers at O'Hare by May 1.
   The control tower now has 32 journeyman controllers, compared
with the FAA's goal of 72. Staff reassignments will add five
full-performance controllers to the O'Hare tower by Nov. 20 and
eight by Jan. 20, Simon said.
   Some of the measures such as limiting radio conversations between
pilots and the tower will occur immediately, while others will begin
next year.
   The plan also calls for additional staff training, runway
improvements, upgrading equipment and, by 1993, building a new
control tower at O'Hare.
   The FAA did not estimate the cost of implementing the various
measures, but Simon said the agency believes enough money is
available in its current budget to cover most of the improvements
planned during the year.

<HEAD>Meatpacker Hit With Record $4.33 Million Fine for Labor Violations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration on Friday slapped a record $4.33 million fine on John
Morrell & Co., saying the meatpacker forced hundreds of injured
employees at its plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., to keep working, even
immediately after surgery.
   The fine, the largest against a single employer in the agency's
17-year history, reflects what Assistant Labor Secretary John A.
Pendergrass called ``an employer who knew about a serious health
hazard, saw the tragic toll on its workers and chose to ignore it.''
   Morrell, the nation's fifth largest meatpacker, said it would
seek an injunction on Monday in U.S. District Court in Sioux Falls
``to stop OSHA from singling us out for penalties ... for what is
clearly a national, multi-industry safety and health problem.''
   Pendergrass, however, said an OSHA inspection of the giant plant
begun six months ago uncovered ``the worst conditions we've found in
any industry to date.''
   Morrell Chairman Milton J. Schloss called the fine ``grossly
unfair and totally unjustified.''
   ``This is guilt by headline,'' Schloss said from the company's
headquarters in Cincinnati. ``It clearly is unfair for OSHA to
single us out and demand we do more when we already are leading the
industry in this effort.''
   The fines all stem from what is increasingly recognized as
cumulative trauma disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome and
tendinitis in which joints become incapable of movement because of
repeated hand, wrist and arm motions that wear away soft tissue
protecting them.
   OSHA has levied fines in the past against companies that ignore
the disorder _ including some against auto producers and a $3.1
million penalty against another meatpacker, IBP Corp., last May.
   IBP, the nation's second largest meatpacker, has appealed its
fine, which stemmed from working conditions that the agency found at
its Dakota City, Neb., plant.
   But nowhere, OSHA officials said Friday, have government
investigators found such widespread evidence of the disorders and
such willful disregard for those injured as at Morrell's Sioux Falls
plant.
   From May 1987 to May 1988, more than 800 of the 2,000 workers at
the plant sustained ``serious and sometimes disabling injuries,''
OSHA said.
   And some departments in the plant had incidence rates of 75
injured workers for every 100 full-time employees.
   The government said Morrell's rate of injuries was nine times the
average for the meatpacking industry _ the most hazardous in the
country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics _ and 652 times
the rate of job injuries for businesses in general.
   Of the 817 Morrell workers at Sioux Falls, 93 percent received no
time off and 39 percent were denied lighter duty needed for healing,
OSHA said.
   Sixty-three Morrell workers who underwent surgery received an
average of only 1.1 days off, compared with 30 days to 60 days
recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health for recovery before returning to the job.
   OSHA said it found 27 workers who underwent surgery who received
no time off.
   ``There were indications that recommendations of physicians were
totally ignored,'' Pendergrass said.
   Friday's action was the latest in a string of fines levied
against the Sioux Falls plant. From 1984 through September, Morrell
has been fined six times by the agency for a total of $758,910 for
violations at the facility.
   Frank White, OSHA's top enforcement officer, said Morrell had
hired ergonomists _ experts in designing work stations to avoid
stress and trauma _ in 1986 and last April to study the problem.
   But, White added, ``We have no clear evidence at this point that
any changes have been made.'' He added, however, the government
inspectors have not been inside the plant in recent months.
   Schloss cited a ruling by a Labor Department law judge last week
dismissing a $690,100 fined assessed against the company in April
1987 for what OSHA called deliberate falsification of its health and
safety records.
   The law judge, James. A. Cronin Jr., said OSHA had missed a
six-month statute of limitations for writing the citations from the
time that the agency first told the company that it wanted to
inspect the records.
   Morrell said in a statement that ``union work rules and the
grievance process have often been used to block'' changes in
workers' routines designed to alleviate the problems of
repetitive-motion duties.
   But Al Zack, a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial
Workers that represents the Morrell employees, said the rotation
system Morrell cited was proposed and rejected five years go.
   ``It was a cost-cutting scheme to cut wages and had absolutely
nothing to do with safety,'' Zack said.
   Previously, the largest fine assessed against one employer was a
$4.11 million levy in 1987 against Bath Iron Works of Maine,
primarily for construction safety violations.
   OSHA and the company last week agreed to a $650,000 settlement,
with Bath Iron Works agreeing to institute a company-wide program to
end the dangerous conditions and finance health and safety research.

<TEXT>
   Zambians voted overwhelmingly to give
President Kenneth Kaunda, the nation's founding father, another
five-year term in office, according to results released Friday.
   While the final outcome of Wednesday's presidential and
parliamentary elections are not expected until late Saturday, Kaunda
captured 93.6 percent of the ballots counted so far, officials said.
   The results were from 90 of the 125 constituencies.
   Kaunda, 64, who led the former British colony of Northern
Rhodesia to independence as Zambia Oct. 24, 1964 was the only
presidential candidate. Voters marked an eagle if they supported
Kaunda and a frog if they opposed him.
   Also up for election were the 125 seats in the National Assembly.
There were 609 candidates for the seats.
   Despite Zambia's severe economic problems, Kaunda has remained
popular and has served five terms. Most Zambians believe he has done
well in keeping their country free of civil strife that plagues
other African nations.
   One of the first tasks confronting him is the nation's $5 billion
foreign debt, which saps 40 percent of export income.
   The massive ``yes'' vote arms him with a mandate to carry out
economic reforms needed to check inflation, record unemployment and
rising urban crime.
   Key ministers were re-elected, strengthening Kaunda's hand in
seeking badly needed economic reforms.
   Prime Minister Kebby Musokotwane held on to his constituency and
is expected to remain premier in the new Cabinet.
   Kaunda is unlikely to make any statement on the polling trend
until after the final results are announced Saturday, aides said.
   He needed a simple majority of the ballots cast to remain in
power, or two-thirds of the total registered voters' support. Zambia
has 2.6 million registered voters.

<HEAD>More Subsidized Wheat Sold to China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exporters have sold China an additional 550,000
metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for shipment in
January, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The sales, equal to about 20.2 million bushels, were handled by
six companies: Cargill Inc., 70,000 tons; Continental Grain Co.,
160,000; Richco Grain Ltd., 40,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 120,000;
Ferruzzi USA Inc., 130,000; and Nichimen America Inc., 30,000.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part
of an authorized 2 million tons of wheat announced on Aug. 18 under
the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwait said the latest sale all but used up the Aug. 18
authorization, leaving only 10,000 tons still available to China.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $3.80 per
bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $77 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   The program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to
meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Goldthwait said the bonuses due the six exporters for the latest
deal averaged $19.12 per ton of wheat, or about 52 cents per bushel.

   Watching patrol officers execute high-speed automobile drills and

<HEAD>Foes Of Detroit JOA Argue Against Partial Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foes of the planned partial merger of Detroit's
two daily newspapers argued in court Friday that neither the papers'
circulation nor advertising revenues were in the classic ``downward
spiral'' that warrants merging business and production operations.
   At issue before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals was whether then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III properly
gave the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News permission to form
a joint operating agreement.
   The decision Meese made before leaving office last summer has
been stayed while under court challenge by a group of readers and
advertisers.
   The Michigan group contends neither daily is a failing newspaper
deserving of an antitrust exemption under the 1970 Newspaper
Preservation Act.
   The Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder, Inc., and the News,
purchased in 1986 by Gannett Co., Inc., sought the joint operating
agreement as a way to stem continuing losses by both newspapers
since 1980. Both have weekday circulations of more than 600,000.
   Opponents' attorney William B. Schultz said the only reason the
two newspapers have lost money is their eight-year battle to put
each other out of business by drastically cutting advertising and
circulation rates.
   ``On the day that they announced they were going to apply for the
JOA, both papers stated that they had fought this competition to a
virtual draw,'' Schultz said.
   ``There was ample support for the operation of two newspapers''
in Detroit, he said.
   ``It was true that the Free Press was losing money,'' Schultz
said. ``But it's true that the News was losing almost as much.''
   Knight-Ridder's attorney, Clark Clifford, argued that ``the Free
Press is not a strong paper. It is only what it is because in the
last eight years or so Knight-Ridder has pumped in $176 million _
that's what kept it alive.''
   Locked into this money-losing competition, ``There is nothing
that the newspaper can do without violating the antitrust laws by
calling up the News and say `let's have a price increase,''' said
Justice Department attorney Douglas Letter.
   Meese accepted the administrative law judge's factual findings
but not the recommendation that he reject the partial merger. Meese
concluded that if he denied the JOA, Knight-Ridder would carry out
its threat to close the Free Press, which has lost $100 million
since 1980.
   Schultz said Meese irrationally ignored the administrative law
judge's scenario that a rejection of the joint operating agreement
would prompt the News, and in turn, the Free Press, to raise their
prices.
   The administrative law judge predicted that both papers would
then make money.
   Schultz said Meese never explained why he ignored the
administrative law judge's rejection of testimony from Gannett
Chairman Allen H. Neuharth, who vowed that the News would never
raise its prices.
   Judge Laurence Silberman questioned whether the court could
second-guess Meese's ``reasonable prediction that if the JOA is
denied that the News will not raise its prices.''
   Silberman said the administrative law judge essentially concluded
that ``the Free Press is not quite on its knees'' while Meese found
that ``they haven't waved a white flag yet but it looks like they
are shot full of holes.''
   A lower-court judge upheld Meese's decision under which the two
dailies would publish separate morning and evening newspapers but
combine their advertising, business and production facilities.

<TEXT>
   Two whales trapped for more than two weeks
by encircling Arctic ice apparently swam to freedom before daylight
today, after days of effort by Eskimos and icebreakers, an official
said.
   ``They were last seen at 8:45 a.m. They were looking good,''
North Slope Borough Mayor George Ahmaogak said after talking by
radio to Eskimos who had gone to open breathing holes for the
whales. The last sighting was about an hour before sunrise.
   ``I feel great. I feel like I got no more burden,'' said Arnold
Brower, the senior whaling captin who directed the Eskimo rescue
efforts of cutting breathing holes in the ice with chain saws.
   Asked if he was confident the two California gray whales swam to
freedom, actually open channels in the ice leading to ice-free water
200 miles away, rather than died, Brower replied: ``Yes.'' A third
whale disappeared a week ago and was presumed dead.
   As night fell Thursday in sub-zero temperatures, rescuers had
left the whales in a breathing hole just 330 yards from open water,
a distance that federal whale biologist David Withrow called
``essentially one long dive.''
   Twice Wednesday, the giant mammals traveled more than 300 yards
under the ice to reach new breathing holes, he said. But they
appeared reluctant to traverse the distance Thursday.
   The Eskimos crews had gone out early today to cut additional
holes to coax the animals toward the open water, said Ahmaogak.
   The whales' condition appeared worse after they struggled through
the slush and ice left in the icebreakers' wake Wednesday night and
Thursday. Both bled from multiple but superficial cuts.
   The Soviet icebreaker Vladimir Arseniev and its companion ship,
the Admiral Makarov, had remained nearby and offered to lend further
assistance by cutting a second path through the ice off the northern
Alaska coast. The ships then planned to depart for their home port
of Vladivostok.
   Rear Adm. Sigmund Petersen of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration said the Soviet crews were ``ready to go
home.'' Their ships had been at sea for nearly six months and were
diverted for the last three days to assist the whale-rescue effort.
   ``We're here until those whales depart from the area,'' Ron
Morris, the rescue coordinator, said before the whales disappeared
early today. He said that if it was evident the whales had reached
open water, then ``that's all we're going to do ... the whales are
on their own.''
   The whales were caught in the arctic ice for nearly three weeks
by an early freeze, halting their annual migration to their winter
home off Baja California.
   The mammals' plight triggered a massive rescue effort involving
chain saw-wielding Eskimos and the Soviet icebreakers that captured
worldwide attention. The effort has cost an estimated $1.3 million.
   Rescuers thought that after the icebreakers broke a channel to
open water Wednesday the whales would resume their migration. But
the pair lingered and parts of the channel refroze.
   The eventual fate of the creatures may never be known because
scientists turned down the option of attaching radio transmitters to
them. Some rescuers said they'd rather not know what happens to them.
   The temperature hovered at minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit Thursday
night, quickly refreezing escape channels cut by the Arseniev. The
plunging temperatures also were beginning to put a glaze of ice on
the open water to which rescuers were trying to lead the whales.
   National Weather Service ice analyst Gary Hufford said the whales
had shown an ability to break newly formed ice, so he remained
optimistic they could survive if they got beyond the remnants of the
pressure ridge crushed earlier in the week by the Soviet icebreakers.
   When rescuers found the whales early Thursday, they were
maintaining a small breathing hole about 1{ miles from where they
were last seen Wednesday night.
   Concerned with the whales' inability to negotiate the partially
refrozen channel, Eskimo laborers cut more than three dozen new
breathing holes in a path toward open water. The whales followed
dutifully, and were resting in the last breathing hole when darkness
fell.
   The Eskimos were prevented from moving further because the ice
was unstable as a result of the icebreakers' earlier efforts.

   About 5,000 people defied
authorities by rallying in historic Wenceslas Square on Friday, then
shouted ``Shame!'' and ``Gestapo!'' at police who cleared them with
clubs and water cannon.
   Powerful jets of water slashed indiscriminately into the crowd,
knocking some people over and sending others fleeing down side
streets.
   The state news agency CTK said 87 people were arrested. Western
journalists saw police beating some of the demonstrators with clubs
and plainclothes officers twisted the arms of others while leading
them to police buses.
   Hundreds of police, some with dogs on leashes, swarmed through
the plaza to disperse the thousands of all ages who assembled on the
70th anniversary of Czechoslovak independence to demand reform and
greater freedom.
   Police fired tear gas into a crowd of several hundred people
watching from the steps of the National Museum overlooking the
square, which stretches for half a mile in central Prague.
   A cloud of tear gas billowed under a huge, official poster on the
museum proclaiming, ``Seventy (years), all power in the Czechoslovak
Socialist Republic belongs to the working people.''
   CTK said the disturbances only involved about 2,000 people but
said they also spread to the nearby Old Town Square.
   ``The actions of internal enemies of socialism and debased
elements were prepared well ahead of time with the support of
foreign, anti-Socialist emigre centers and publicized by Western
media,'' CTK said.
   ``The aim of the confrontation was to cast doubts'' on official
policies and ``to discredit Czechoslovakia,'' CTK said.
   By early evening, police trucks had moved off Wenceslas Square
into nearby sidestreets. There was a heavy presence of uniformed
police throughout the city center.
   Friday's crowd defied a week of warnings from the communist
authorities not to attend the rally called by the Charter 77 human
rights organization and four other independent groups.
   The rally followed what dissident sources described as the most
extensive roundups of dissidents in recent years, in which at least
70 were detained.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Phyllis Oakley said:
``The detentions show that Czechoslovakia has far to go to bridge
the chasm between the current practices of the authorities and the
democratic ideals upon which the country was founded.''
   The rally ban and show of force appeared intended to prevent a
protest similar to one of about 10,000 people Aug. 21, the
anniversary of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed the
``Prague spring'' of liberal reform.
   Authorities reported 77 people detained after the August
demonstration, which riot police dispersed after several thousand
people marched through Prague demanding ``Freedom'' and a withdrawal
of the estimated 80,000 Soviet troops stationed in Czechoslovakia.
   Chants of ``We want freedom!'' and ``Long live truth!'' rose
repeatedly from Friday's crowd, but there were none about the
Soviets.
   In the 20 years since 1968, the Communist Party has been hard on
dissent but kept supplies of consumer goods generous as a reward for
political silence from most of the 15.5 million citizens.
   Current party leaders, put in power by the Kremlin after 1968,
have indicated they won't adopt the sweeping reforms being promoted
in the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Roman Catholic activists, young people and independent peace
campaigners have become increasingly active in recent months. Police
in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, used water cannons last March to
disperse about 2,000 activists who protested in a downtown square
for more religious freedom.
   On Friday, an estimated 5,000 people gathered at the rallying
hour of 3 p.m. Many chanted ``Masaryk!'' in honor of Thomas Garrigue
Masaryk, who founded democratic Czechoslovakia and became its
president. Masaryk is still held in esteem by citizens, as is his
Slovak ally Milan Rastislav Stefanik and President Woodrow Wilson,
who backed their campaign for independence.
   When police gave the order to disperse, they sang the national
anthem.
   Derisive whistles and shouts of ``Shame!'' filled the air as the
first group of about 30 helmeted police with clubs moved into the
square.
   Ladislav Lis, a Charter 77 activist, appeared in the center of
the square and cried out: ``In the name of the Movement for Civil
Freedom, hurrah!'' The crowd roared support.
   His reference was to a coalition of Charter 77 and other groups
organized recently, which issued a list of 12 demands for more civil
and political freedom signed by more than 120 prominent activists.
   Reporters could not see whether Lis was detained in the ensuing
melee. The square was deserted after about 40 minutes, except for
dozens of police vehicles and patrolling officers.
   Riot police sealed the square off from side streets, where groups
of demonstrators could be heard chanting defiantly, some shouting
``The world sees this!''
   Those on the museum steps retreated toward the main railroad
station, where some still taunted police two hours later. Police
sirens wailed through central Prague.
   The poster on the museum was part of the first official
celebration in four decades of communist rule of democratic
Czechoslovakia's founding Oct. 28, 1918.
   This year, authorities proclaimed it a national holiday and held
a mass official rally Thursday in Wenceslas Square. The official
rally was scheduled for Thursday to give citizens a three-day
weekend.
   A limited amnesty was declared, under which the government's
general prosecutor said about 7,000 prisoners would be freed. Anna
Sabatova of the Committee for the Unjustly Prosecuted said she
believed only a handful of political prisoners would be among them.

   Premier Branko Mikulic told leaders
in emergency session Friday that the economy must soon undergo a
radical market-oriented overhaul, the official news ageny Tanjug
said.
   He also proposed unspecified social programs ``to dampen possible
increase of social tensions'' as a result of the reforms, which call
for closing unprofitable enterprises, Tanjug reported.
   Raif Dizdarevic, head of the nation's collective presidency,
warned the officials earlier Friday that Yugoslavia is facing its
``final hour'' to put the economic changes into effect.
   ``Political and ethnic tensions have increased to such a degree
that both the political and security situation have seriously
deteriorated,'' he said.
   They were addressing a rare emergency meeting between the Cabinet
and the country's nine-member collective presidency called to
discuss a deepening economic crisis and resulting social strife.
Only two such emergency meetings have been held since World War II,
in 1981 and 1985.
   Economic and ethnic problems have combined to prompt months of
demonstrations with calls for an overhaul of the communist
leadership and introduction of a multiparty system. The strife has
led to the ouster of party leaders in one of two autonomous national
provinces.
   Mikulic said the government will introduce fundamental
market-oriented economic reform beginning next year to fight rampant
inflation and growing labor unrest.
   Deputy Premier Janez Zemljaric said at the meeting that
Yugoslavia's annual inflation rate touched an all-time annual record
of 236 percent in October. Unemployment stands at about 15 percent.
   The new economic system calls for closing down all unprofitable
enterprises, widely introducing private domestic and foreign capital
investments, and floating stocks and bonds.
   Yugoslavia's current economy mixes central planning and local
worker control. About half of the country's companies are reported
to be losing money, and layoffs could fuel more social unrest.
   In addition to hundreds of strikes, the country has faced Serbian
nationalist demonstrations that have aggravated tension between
Serbs and other groups in this fragile federation of six republics
and two provinces.
   Press reports have speculated on the possibility of an army
takeover to quell the dissent.
   However, Mikulic on Friday dismissed talk of ``an imminent
military coup or the danger of civil war.''

   An 11-year-old girl who was injured when
a metal and plastic lawn dart stuck 2 inches into her head remained
in coma Friday, and doctors said she probably suffered brain damage.
   Also Friday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission voted to ban
the sale of lawn darts. Opponents say the darts have severely
injured an estimated 150 to 200 youngsters in the last 10 years.
   Amy Herrin of McMinnville and some of her friends were playing
with a neighbor's lawn dart set Tuesday when the girl was struck by
a 1 pound dart, said Sue Tucker, Amy's mother.
   The child was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit of
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where doctors induced the
coma, said spokesman Wayne Wood.
   ``She could conceivably be in a coma for several more days or
even two or three more weeks,'' he said.
   ``It's completely dependent on the needed treatment. She's in a
coma to prevent swelling of the brain and the damage that can
cause,'' Wood said. ``If at some point the doctors feel she no
longer needs to be in a coma, they will bring her out.''
   There has been some swelling of the girl's brain and she probably
suffered brain damage, he said.
   Mrs. Tucker said Thursday night she supports the ban on lawn dart.
   ``I'm glad that they are going to do something, and I know they
will,'' she said. ``It is not a toy that you play with.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski told
the nation Friday night he is not worried about prospects for talks
with the opposition, and he instead is concentrating on the ailing
economy.
   ``I would be a poor premier dealing only with the round table and
making light of problems of millions of my fellow countrymen,''
Rakowski said in a 10-minute nationwide television address that he
said would be the first of several.
   The appearance, broadcast immediately after the evening news, was
to report on the results of his first month in office.
   In an earlier meeting with Western reporters, Rakowski said the
talks promised by Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak in August
are at the moment blocked, but ``I think that the round table will
take place.''
   The government has demanded that Solidarity drop from its
delegation to the proposed talks two opposition activists, and
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has refused a meeting to discuss the
matter, throwing the future of the talks in doubt.
   In both his TV address and in the meeting with reporters,
Rakowski struck a note of unconcern at the impasse.
   ``There is no compromise at the given moment,'' he told
reporters. ``But I treat this moment as a moment only. I must admit
that I have not thought about who should make the first step now.''
   He continued, ``Improving living conditions for the Polish people
are the most important thing for me. ... The most important thing is
that we can buy a piece of ham in a store and not on the black
market.''
   Rakowski, who met the reporters in connection with a scheduled
visit to Poland next week of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said
some Western politicians are beginning to recognize the reforms
taking place in Poland.
   ``Do you really think that all Western politicians condemn us?''
he said. ``Do you think that the Western politicians don't know that
it's the most liberal country in Eastern Europe and that the reforms
are the deepest here?''
   The talks were agreed to in August during Poland's worst wave of
strikes in seven years. Walesa halted the strikes after being
promised that the talks could include the topics of relegalizing
Solidarity as well as broad questions of political and economic
reform.
   Earlier Friday, a U.S. government spokeswoman said the United
States was concerned by reports of the impasse in progress towards
the talks with Walesa and the opposition.
   ``We had welcomed the commitment by the government of Poland to
hold meaningful round-table talks with representatives of Polish
society,'' said State Department spokeswoman Philly Oakley in
Washington.
   ``If conducted in good faith, such negotiations have the
potential to put Poland on the path of recovery and enhanced
international economic standing.''
   But Rakowski told the reportes he doubted that legalizing
Solidarity, banned after the 1981 martial law crackdown, would
create ``fantastic growth'' and said he was ``against the myth that
everything in Poland depends on Solidarity.''
   ``I already notice a certain progress in the economy and it was
done without Solidarity,'' he said. ``There is no Solidarity in the
countryside and production is growing every year by four percent.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban had announced Tuesday that the
government insisted on a preliminary meeting with Walesa to discuss
objections to the participation at the round table of two prominent
Solidarity advisers, Jacek Kuron and Adam Michnik.
   Saying it would set a bad ``precedent'' for him to allow the
government to interfere in an internal union decision, Walesa
rejected such a preliminary meeting and asked that the talks begin
immediately.
   Referring to Kuron and Michnik, Rakowski said: ``We don't want at
the table two men who openly express and have been expressing for
some years now their wish to overthrow the system, the government.
We are willing to talk to other people.''
   But he told the reporters that he did not think the impasse would
be permanent. ``Poles are known for their capacity to compromise and
there will always be a way out.''
   Andrzej Stelmachowski, a church mediator acting for Walesa in
organizing the talks, said in an interview that, ``The ball is on
the other side now.''
   In the TV address, Rakowski said his newly appointed government
ministers were getting familiar with their new jobs but have already
taken some steps ``with full energy.''
   He listed the creation of committees to deal with economic and
social political problems; a raise in retirees' pensions; plans to
streamline government bureaucracy; and the introduction of
free-market practices in the distribution of some foodstuffs.

<TEXT>
   A minister said Friday he would not take
classes from his Christian school to see an Egyptian art exhibit at
the Mint Museum because its opening was used to promote paganism.
   An exhibit of more than 70 artifacts from the time of the pharaoh
Rameses II opened Oct. 1 at the art museum. Some 600,000 people are
expected to see the show through January.
   The Rev. Joseph Chambers, chairman of Concerned Charlotteans and
head of the Paw Creek Christian Academy, said he felt the promoters
of an opening ceremony for the exhibit showed ``insensitivity'' when
they invited people to join in a ceremony in which ancient gods were
asked to appear and bless the exhibition.
   Chambers stressed he was not opposed to the exhibit.
   Museum director Milton Bloch said that while he respected
Chambers' concerns, there was no need for an apology.
   ``The Mint's pre-exhibition procession and promotion used some
flowery phrases and theatrical fiction which it has turned out has
offended some people in our community,'' he said. ``This result is
entirely unintended.''

   Recent highlights of the Soviet space program:
   Dec. 23, 1987 _ Cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov begin
their long mission aboard the Mir, an orbiting space station
launched in February 1986 as a permanently manned fixture in space.
   Dec. 29, 1987 _ Cosmonaut Yuri Romanenko arrives back on Earth
after spending 326 days in space, a space endurance record.
   Jan. 23, 1988 _ Unmanned Progress 34 cargo craft docks with
orbital platform Mir. Re-supply ferries carrying food, fuel, mail
and hardware are periodically sent, and jettisoned after being
unloaded.
   Feb. 26 _ Titov and Manarov work outside Mir for 4 hours, 25
minutes to successfuly replace a solar battery.
   March 17 _ Soviets launch their first payload for a paying
customer when they lift a satellite for India into orbit.
   May 15 _ Soviets successfully launch a military intelligence
craft the size of a school bus into a 530-mile circular orbit.
   June 7-17 _ A joint Soviet-Bulgarian mission, the first manned
mission of 1988, docks with Mir as part of a 10-day mission.
   June 30 _ Titov and Manarov work for five hours outside Mir in an
unsuccessful attempt to repair a faulty component on a telescope.
   July 7 and 12 _ In the most complex planetary mission attempted
by the Soviets, two robot craft are launched to explore Mars and the
Martian moon Phobos. They include instruments for exploration
provided by eight countries.
   Aug. 29-Sept. 7 _ A joint Soviet-Afghan mission docks with Mir.
Cosmonaut Dr. Valery Polyakov joins Titov and Manarov for the
duration of their flight. Cosmonauts Abdul Ahad Mohmand of
Afghanistan and Vladimir Lyakhov, attempting to return to Earth, are
stranded in orbit due to equipment problems and human error on their
Soyuz TM-5 capsule. After 26 hours and two unsuccessful attempts to
re-enter the atmosphere, and with food and oxygen running
dangerously low, the capsule lands safely.
   Sept. 9 _ Roald Z. Sagdeyev, head of the Soviet space program,
reveals that one of the two probes bound for Mars has been rendered
useless after a ground controller sent it an incorrect message.
   Oct. 20 _ Titov and Manarov spend 4 hours and 12 minutes outside
Mir, successfully replacing a faulty component on a telescope, the
repair that eluded them in June.

<HEAD>US Seeks Arbitration To Resolve Dispute With Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department confirmed Friday it will
ask outside arbiters to resolve a dispute with the Soviet Union over
$29 million in U.S. claims relating to damages and defective
construction work on the nearly completed U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   President Reagan announced Thursday that he is recommending to
Congress that the building be demolished because the Soviets
installed listening devices. He said a new ``American-built''
embassy will be constructed.
   State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the
United States has invoked arbitration under a ``disputes clause'' in
the construction contract.
   ``A claim for damages relating to Soviet penetration or the
bugging of the new office building has not yet been quantified,
pending final building design for the new embassy building,'' she
said.
   A State Department source who disclosed the $29 million claim
against the Soviets on Thursday said that before the issue could go
before an arbitration panel, ``We have to show good faith that the
Soviets and we have tried to work this out.'' The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The claims for the delays and defects are to be negotiated by an
arbitration panel in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, in a dispatch from Washington, said
U.S. claims that the building is riddled with spying devices are
``groundless'' and ``obviously farfetched.''
   Congress will be asked to approve construction of a new embassy
built by U.S. workers using American materials.
   James Schlesinger, the former defense secretary who documented
security problems at the embassy, said Reagan's recommendation that
the building be razed and rebuilt shows ``reality caught up with
us.''
   ``The United States has tended to be complacent over the years
about Soviet technology,'' said Schlesinger, whom Reagan
commissioned to study the embassy. ``In this case, Soviet technology
turned out to be immensely and impressively sophisticated.''

   A man stabbed his girlfriend early Friday,
but he was killed when he was struck by her truck as she drove away,
police said.
   David Williams, 34, of Greenville, R.I., died of severe head
trauma after the 6:30 a.m. altercation in a parking lot, said Lt.
Steve Williams.
   Jane Drake, 32, of Franklin, underwent surgery at the University
of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester for stab wounds, but a
spokeswoman said Drake's family requested that her condition be
withheld.
   Franklin police said no charges were filed against Drake because
it was not immediately clear if she hit Williams intentionally.
   Drake, a truck driver, drove her tractor-trailer around the
corner, stopped and ran into a store for assistance, police said.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rise in aluminum prices has been
followed by thefts of highway guardrails and signs, and state police
are checking with scrap metal dealers in an attempt to track the
thieves.
   State highway officials say 1,557 feet of metal railing worth an
estimated $77,000 have been stolen since July from six highway
overpasses in eastern Connecticut. State police spokeswoman Marcy
Stamm said Friday that several signs also have been stolen.
   ``The spot price of aluminum went up and all of a sudden it
became a hot item,'' said Andrew Throwe, a maintenance manager with
the state Department of Transportation.
   Aluminum prices have tripled since 1986 and thefts of aluminum
have been reported around the country.
   Stanley H. Ostrinsky, a Manchester scrap dealer, said he pays 50
cents a pound for usable aluminum, up from 40 cents a year ago.
   State auditors Henry J. Becker Jr. and Leo V. Donohue detailed
the aluminum loss in a report to Gov. William A. O'Neill. The
auditors said Thursday that 1,557 feet of aluminum guardrail, which
they say would cost $77,825 to replace, have been taken since July.
   Department officials said all the stolen guardrails have been
replaced.
   Police refused to say if they have any leads in the thefts.

   Sen. Dan Quayle compared Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis to a ``Mr. Pretzel man''
because of his ``twists and turns on the issues'' as the Indiana
senator stumped Friday in Pennsylvania Dutch country.
   On a bus tour that included stops to talk to school children and
attend rallies, Quayle noted that the Berks County region was
renowned for making great pretzels.
   ``That's pretty appropriate,'' the Republican vice presidential
candidate told a rally at the Roman Catholic campus of Alvernia
College.
   ``Mr. Dukakis has made more twists and turns on the issues than
any one of your pretzels,'' he said. ``Maybe that ought to be the
symbol of their campaign _ the pretzel.''
   Quayle worked the pretzel idea into a litany he often uses in his
stump speech to characterize Dukakis.
   ``You could call him Mr. Tax Increase, Mr. Polluter, Mr. Furlough
Man, Mr. Weak-On-National Defense, Mr. Pretzel Man.'' But, added
Quayle, one thing voters should never call Dukakis is ``Mr.
President.''
   In what an aide said was a bid to ``beef up voter turnout,''
Quayle took toured central Pennsylvania Republican strongholds as
well as Democratic areas where President Reagan pulled a majority of
votes in his 1984 presidential campaign.
   ``We're not taking anything for granted,'' Quayle told reporters
before leaving Friday morning for Pennsylvania from Syracuse, N.Y.
   Quayle's mission, according to aides, was to encourage voter
turnout and ward off complacency in Pennsylvanhia, a state where
Bush is polling a bit ahead but the race is still considered close.
   Republican Sens. John Heinz and Arlen Specter, as well as state
party chairman Earl Baker campaiged with Quayle, urged voters not to
assume tht because Bush is ahead in national polls that they don't
have to vote.
   The race said Baker, ``is neck and neck'' in Pennsylvania.
   In Lancaster County, Quayle adviser Jim Cicconi said, ``This area
is clearly a good Republican area and we're trying to beef up
turnout here.''
   At a drizzling outdoor rally outside the historic Lancaster
market, Quayle kept up a drumbeat of ridicule against Dukakis,
calling the rainy day ``Dukakis weather.''
   Quayle quoted from a Boston Herald endorsement of Bush, which
criticized Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor.
   The editorial cautioned those outside the state: ``Don't make our
mistake. We too wanted a leader and what we got was a man all too
willing to sacrifice taxpayers of this state to his own quest for
higher office.''
   The bus trip included roadside stops to greet schoolchildren who
were let out of class to see the candidate.
   And there were some quirky sights along the way _ a woman in a
witch outfit, two people dressed up like clowns, a drive-in called
Hoosier hamburgers _ as well as scenes typifying the agricultural
region. Amish residents walked the streets, and people in colonial
dress and a fife-and-drum band greeted Quayle in downtown Lancaster.

   Only a test battery, an electrical
connector and an insulation blanket were damaged by a flash fire
that hit the Magellan Venus spacecraft in a hangar here, NASA
announced Friday.
   An agency official reiterated in a statement that the Oct. 17
accident would have no impact on Magellan's launch, scheduled next
April aboard a space shuttle.
   Major systems on the $216 million probe were not harmed, and the
total cost of the damaged items was just $87,000, said John R.
Busse, chairman of a board investigating the fire.
   A technician who mistakenly plugged an electrical cable into the
wrong socket during a test was blamed by NASA for the short circuit
that triggered smoke and a 2-3-inch tongue of flame from the test
battery.
   Astronauts are to deploy Magellan from the cargo bay of the
shuttle Atlantis. After a 446-day outward journey, the spacecraft is
to orbit Venus and map its surface for 243 days.

<TEXT>
   Noveane Jackson thought she was $5,000 richer
when a wad of cash turned up in the pocket of a used jacket she
bought for $1.05.
   But the store owner convinced police the money was his, and Mrs.
Jackson is ready to do battle.
   Mrs. Jackson, who bought the jacket Oct. 22 at The Attic in
Athens, has hired an attorney to see if she can fight the decision
and regain the 50 $100 bills from store owner Randy Jackson. The two
are not related.
   ``I think the fairest thing to say is she just wants justice to
be done,'' her attorney, George Peters of Athens, said Thursday.
``Obviously, she wasn't certain of her legal rights at the time this
occurred.''
   Peters said the coat apparently had been hanging on a rack in the
store for some time when Mrs. Jackson decided to buy it.
   ``She'd already paid for it and it was being folded when (the
money) was found,'' he said.
   Police officer Inez McElhannon took the coat and the money after
a dispute arose over their ownership.
   Then the store owner contacted police Sunday night to claim the
money.
   ``He said it was his coat and that he didn't know his wife had
gotten it (to sell),'' Ms. McElhannon said, adding that he told
police he had not realized he had left the money in the jacket.
   McElhannon said Jackson told her he thought the money had been
taken in a burglary last year. She said he had reported to police
after the burglary that a watch was taken.

   A sea lion that got fishing line
tangled around its neck has evaded rescuers for six weeks and could
die if it isn't captured soon, marine mammal experts said Friday.
   The injured sea lion keeps to a buoy about 500 yards off Newport
Harbor, said Judi Jones, a director of Friends of the Sea
Lion-Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach.
   ``Its chances for survival are not good'' if not treated, said
Bill Ford, an officer of the organization, which rescues and
rehabilitates injured and sick seals.
   The animal is believed to be between 2 and 4 years old. Sea lions
reach maturity about 8.
   ``As the animal grows, the monofilament line does not expand, and
the line will eventually cut off the organs in its neck,'' Ford said.
   ``The minute we come near, their instinct is to jump off the
buoy,'' Ms. Jones said. ``If they come up to us, it's their choice.
But our approaching them is a threat. If they're injured, they're a
bit more wary.''
   Sedation is not a viable alternative.
   ``The minute the animal feels the stick or dart, it becomes
frightened,'' Ms. Jones said. ``Then it heads for the water, gets
drowsy and eventually drowns.''

   The nation's schoolchildren say that for
only the second time in 200 years the United States will have a
president with the first name of George.
   The first, as every kid learns, was George Washington, and the
second will be Republican George Bush, acccording to a poll of
670,000 children ages 5 to 15 by Weekly Reader magazine.
   The students say Bush will beat Democrat Michael Dukakis 58
percent to 40 percent, according to the Weekly Reader presidential
poll, which has correctly called eight races since its inception in
1956.
   In the first year, students named Republican Dwight Eisenhower to
beat Democrat Adlai Stevenson by a 60.3 percent to 36.8 percent
margin. Eisenhower won with 57 percent of the vote.
   The magazine's executive editor Lynell Johnson said the reason
the poll has been so accurate is that the schoolchildren reflect the
opinions of their parents.
   ``Since Bush is doing well in all the national polls, I would be
surprised if he wasn't ahead in this poll as well,'' she said.

<HEAD>Arrest Warrant Issued For Adnan Khashoggi In Marcos Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents have obtained an arrest warrant
for financier Adnan Khashoggi, who denies racketeering and fraud
charges filed against him and former Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos, according to published reports here and abroad.
   An English-language newspaper in Saudi Arabia, Arab News of
Jiddah, reported Khashoggi's denial Thursday under a Riyadh
dateline. Arab News editors said the denial was ``remitted'' to
their office, but declined to say how or by whom.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting unidentified sources, reported in
Friday editions that U.S. officials sought the arrest warrant out of
fear that Khashoggi would relocate to a country without any formal
extradition treaty with the United States.
   The U.S. government is accusing Khashoggi, once reported to be
the world's richest man, of acting as a front for Marcos to help
divert assets and hide Marcos' ownership of real estate and valuable
art.
   The Arab News said: ``He is disappointed that a technical legal
question involving the scope of an injunction in a civil case to
which he was not a party has been converted into a criminal
allegation in a totally unprecedented manner. He is confident that
when all of the facts are made public as the proceeding progresses,
his lack of culpability will become manifest.''
   Khashoggi was believed to be ``lying low'' in a European country
consulting with advisers on how he should respond to the charges
contained in a New York grand jury indictment, the Times said.
   The Times quoted sources close to Khashoggi as saying the
financier is considering returning to his native Saudi Arabia, which
has no extradition agreement with the United States.
   The United States has extradition agreements with France, Britain
and Spain, the countries where Khashoggi currently maintains his
primary residences.
   Although he believes he would ultimately be cleared of the
charges, the sources said, he is concerned about the possibility of
being arrested, jailed and extradited.
   Khashoggi's wealth once symbolized the rising economic power of
the oil-rich Arab world in the 1970s. But his financial empire began
to crumble amid a pile of debt in the early 1980s.
   Meanwhile, Marcos' arraignment in New York was delayed Thursday
until a court-appointed doctor can examine the 71-year-old former
Philippine leader in Hawaii, where he and his wife, Imelda, have
lived since leaving the Philippines in 1986.
   Marcos' attorneys argued he was too ill to travel to New York for
the arraignment. Mrs. Marcos, however, was ordered to appear at the
New York hearing on Monday.

   They're going to put former Gov. Lamar
Alexander in the movies and he says he's not sure who would be the
perfect leading man for the this-is-your-life film of his family's
trip to Australia.
   ``Robert Redford is taken in this political season,'' joked
Alexander, who wrote the book ``Six Months Off,'' purchased by
Warner Brothers Television. ``My daughter Kathryn says Chevy Chase
would be perfect.''
   Alexander, now president of the University of Tennessee, said his
children have suggested the two-hour television movie should
resemble National Lampoon's ``European Vacation'' featuring Chase.
   ``That movie was about a not-so-perfect family staggering along
on a European vacation,'' he said Wednesday.
   In buying the rights to the book published in late summer, Warner
Brothers envisions a movie that would serve as a pilot for a
situation comedy series, he said.
   When Alexander and his family moved out of the governor's mansion
in January 1987, they headed for six-months in Australia for what
his wife, Honey, called a learning experience.
   ``I hope they don't show me learning how to drive. For so long I
was driven around (when governor), and then I had to learn to drive
on the wrong side of the road,'' Alexander said referring to
Australia's left hand-drive roads.
   Alexander said it's up to Warner Brothers to decide what to do
with the book, and it could be 1990 before it's on television.
   He declined to say how much he was paid for the rights, but
acknowledged the deal would be a money-maker for him.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Friday signed bills
calling for a three-year, $44.5 million program to help states deal
with radon contamination and to reduce the threat to birds from
plastic six-pack rings.
   The radon bill authorizes $10 million a year for grants to state
and local governments to develop radon programs and another $3
million annually for technical assistance. The balance for other
activities includes $1.5 million for the Environmental Protection
Agency to study radon contamination in schools.
   Radon is a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil
which has been blamed for as many as 20,000 lung cancer deaths
annually in the United States.
   The plastic bill gives the EPA two years to promulgate
regulations that would require use of degradable materials in
beverage six-pack ring carriers. Sixteen states already have laws
requiring those materials.
   Wildlife experts have said the plastic rings can remain intact
for decades and pose a growing threat to fish and waterfowl, which
can become snared in them.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khatami, an Iranian
religious leader who helped overthrow the shah, has died at age 84,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Friday.
   Khatami, father of Mohammed Khatami, the minister of culture and
Islamic guidance, died Thursday of an illness at a Tehran hospital,
the agency said. It did not specify the illness.
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini assigned Khatami the
task of distributing his communications starting in June 1963.
Khomeini's speeches, smuggled into Iran after his exile later the
same year, were instrumental in building opposition to Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in 1979.
   Khomeini appointed Khatami his personal representative and prayer
leader in the central Iranian city of Yazd in July 1982, after the
previous prayer leader was assassinated.
   Khomeini canceled all his appointments Saturday to observe the
death of Khatami, the agency said. In a statement, Khomeini called
Khatami ``a prominent personality and an indefatigable struggler of
the recent decade,'' the news agency said.

<HEAD>Judge Might Change Ruling Protecting Attorney-Client Privilege</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who upheld an attorney's
right to shield the identity of a driver involved in a hit-and-run
fatality said he wants to review the lawyer's testimony on the
``small chance'' he might change his ruling before the case goes to
appeal.
   In a rare display of judicial uncertainty, Palm Beach County
Circuit Judge Timothy P. Poulton said Thursday that he may change or
revise his Oct. 13 decision after reviewing the testimony of
attorney Barry Krischer.
   Krischer was hired by a person claiming to be the driver of a car
that struck and killed Mark Baltes in Palm Beach on March 9, 1986.
The driver asked Krischer to keep his identity secret while
negotiating a plea bargain with prosecutors.
   The plea bargain fell through, however, and Krischer has guarded
the person's identity on the grounds of attorney-client privilege.
   Poulton uphold that privilege in his ruling against Baltes'
parents in their $6 million civil suit seeking to find the identity
of the driver.
   ``If we fail to rule as we do in this case, the result would be
the erection of a wall between the public and attorneys,'' Poulton
wrote in his eight-page order. ``Plaintiff's case has tremendous
emotional appeal. It is difficult to rule against the plaintiff's,
but I am convinced that the law requires it.''
   But a week later, Poulton sent a two-page letter to the attorneys
saying he realized the case would be appealed and that he wanted to
review the testimony.

<HEAD>Army Awards Contract For Development of New Helicopter Engine</HEAD>

   The Army on Friday selected a winning
contractor team to develop the engine that will power its next
generation of helicopters, and gave the go-ahead to two other teams
to compete against each other in designing the rest of the chopper.
   The service, in brief announcements, said it was awarding the
engine contract to the Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Co., a
partnership formed by the Allison Gas Turbine Division of the
General Motors Corp. and the Garrett Engine Division of the Allied
Signal Aerospace Co.
   That partnership was selected over another competing team, known
as APW, formed by the Pratt & Whitney Division of the United
Technologies Corp. and Lycoming of Textron Inc.
   The Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Co. previously had received a
contract worth $132.4 million and on Friday, it won another $75.4
million to continue the work.
   As for designing the rest of the chopper and building prototypes,
the Army said it was releasing funds to two contractor teams and
formally setting them in competition against one another. Each team
received $158 million on Friday to pursue the work, the Army said.
   The two teams include a joint venture of Boeing Helicopters and
United Technology's Sikorsky Aircraft, and another partnership that
includes two units of the McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Bell
Helicopter Textron Inc.
   The Army moves involve a project known as the LHX program and had
been expected ever since Congress approved the fiscal 1989 budget
late last month.
   LHX _ or Light Helicopter Experimental _ is an effort to develop
a new light attack and observation helicopter that can move the Army
into the 21st century. The new craft would be used in replacing
aging fleets of Vietnam-era AH-1 Cobra, OH-6 Cayuse and OH-58 Kiowa
choppers.
   The Army hopes to purchase 2,096 of the new helicopters at a cost
of roughly $40 billion. The LHX program was cut in half early this
year because of budget reductions, but still stands as one of the
Army's most expensive programs ever.
   The two engine teams began competing on what the Army calls the
T-800 engine in July 1985. Each LHX will require two of the engines,
and the Army has long described the T-800's development as a crucial
step in improving existing technology.
   ``Today's award extends LHTEC's full-scale development
contract,'' the Army said. ``APW's contract will be terminated.''
   After developing the new engine, the Army expects the two team
partners, Allison and Garrett, to compete against each other for
annual production awards. Ultimately, the engine work is expected to
be worth more than $1.5 billion to the two companies.
   Allison is based in Indianapolis, Ind., and Garrett is located in
Phoenix, Ariz.
   The new engine is a 1,200 shaft horsepower turbine and the first
deliveries are being scheduled for 1995.
   Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman, said the contract also was
unusual in that LHTEC had provided a guarantee that the average cost
of each engine would not exceed $245,000.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan got Iran mixed up with
Afghanistan briefly Friday, going on to say that moves for a change
of some kind in the Iranian government are under way.
   The confusion came at an appearance before the Los Angeles World
Affairs Council when Reagan was asked if he would support efforts by
the son of the late shah of Iran to restore the monarchy.
   ``If that's what the people of Afghanistan, who have fought so
bravely and courageously to restore their freedom, if that's their
choice ...,'' the president began.
   A member of the council, who was reading written questions
submitted by members of the audience, interrupted and said, ``Mr.
President, we're talking about Iran.''
   ``Oh, what am I doing?'' Reagan said. ``I got into Afghanistan by
mistake, didn't I?''
   ``Do you want me to repeat the question,'' the council member
said.
   Reagan did not ask her to repeat the question, but he recalled
that he and his wife Nancy visited Iran shortly before the shah fell
and the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came to power.
   ``It was amazing to see that country then,'' he said. ``As you
looked at the skyline, you saw derricks all over. These were
building low-cost housing apartments for the people. A land reform
was put into effect that gave land as we once did through
homesteading to the peasants, and maybe part of the reason for the
revolution was that most of that land belonged to the mullahs and
they didn't like having it taken away.''
   ``I know that there are moves on and there are factions that are
organizing right now with the expectation that come the end of the
ayatollah the country can be moved in one of several directions,''
Reagan said.
   ``I think that the United States would be very willing to be
supportive of a regime that wanted to restore democracy and freedom
to the people,'' he said.

<HEAD>First `No' Votes Cast in Supreme Soviet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few legislators of the Supreme Soviet, that
traditional rubber stamp for the leadership, made history Friday
night by voting against decrees restricting street demonstrations.
   They lost by more than 1,300 votes because they were 31 at most
and the other members behaved in the customary manner.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has encouraged debate in his
campaign for more democracy, watched from the dais with other
government and Communist Party leaders.
   Votes are taken by show of hands, usually all hands for whatever
measures the parliament's ruling Presidium adopts between
twice-yearly sessions. The Supreme Soviet chamber in the Grand
Kremlin Palace does not have electronic voting equipment.
   It appeared the leadership expected Friday's dissent because the
two laws were taken out of a Presidium package for separate votes.
   Despite overwhelming support for the laws by Supreme Soviet
deputies, hundreds of them laughed or smiled as Soviet photographers
rushed to record the spectacle of legislators voting no.
   Dissenters kept their hands up long enough for functionaries to
rush around and count.
   One of the 3-month-old decrees they opposed gives broad power to
control demonstrations to paramilitary police, whom protesters have
accused of beating them.
   On that measure, the vote was announced to the deputies as 1,348
in favor, 31 opposed and 24 abstentions. State television reported
one fewer yes vote, with four abstentions, and there was no
explanation for the discrepancy.
   On the second law, which requires advance permission for
demonstrations and has been used by local officials to ban a variety
of gatherings, the vote was announced to deputies as 1,368 for, 13
against and four abstaining.
   Television reported three fewer abstentions and did not mention
the rarity of negative votes in either case.
   The Supreme Soviet took its first step away from rubber-stamping
in closed committee meetings in May, amending a government proposal
on taxation of cooperatives. The new version passed unanimously in
the public session.
   Deputies could move farther toward democracy next month when they
consider a proposal for multiple-candidate elections of delegates to
a new national parliament.
   In introducing the measures, Presidium secretary Tengiz N.
Menteshashvili noted they had been criticized in the press and
letters to the leadership.
   Only one deputy spoke against them _ a factory worker from the
Baltic republic of Estonia, a new Soviet breeding ground of
independence. He said local government councils, not the Interior
Ministry, should decide when paramilitary police are needed to quell
demonstrations.
   ``Each republic has its own traditions,'' said Pavel P. Goryunov
from the city of Tartu. He particularly objected to a provision
allowing paramilitary police to enter homes in pursuit of suspects.
   After Goryunov's remarks, a Moscow subway worker and the chairman
of the Kiev city council spoke for the laws.
   ``We must regulate political freedoms for the good of all,'' said
Alexander S. Sukhanov, the subway worker. He said he did not
understand people who called the laws ``an encroachment on human
rights'' or ``a muzzle on democracy.''
   Colleagues applauded gave him much more applause than Goryunov.
   Menteshashvili, the Presidium secretary, cited ethnic rioting in
Sumgait, Azerbaijan, and problems in other cities as reasons for
strict control of demonstrations. Dozens of people were killed in
the Sumgait riots involving Azerbaijanis and ethnic Armenians.
   He held out the possibility of future amendments to the decrees.
   ``We still have to gain practical experience in democracy,''
Menteshashvili said. ``Then we can introduce amendments.''
   The Supreme Soviet unanimously approved a $795 billion budget for
1989 after trimming a projected deficit from $58 billion to $55
billion. Official reports said additional income was found during
committee sessions.
   Most new investment in the new budget is moved from heavy
industry to providing consumer goods.
   Finance Minister Boris Gostsev said Thursday the government has
run deficits for years because of huge losses by state-owned
businesses. This is the first year a deficit has been acknowledged.

<HEAD>Documents: Ng Told Investigator He Helped Dispose Of Victim's Body</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Ng told a detective
investigating a California murder spree that he helped dispose of a
victim's body, according to court documents released during his
extradition hearing.
   The provincial court hearing is to determine if enough evidence
exists to extradite Ng, a 27-year-old former U.S. Marine, to
California. The hearing has been closed to the public in its second
week.
   Ng, whose name is pronounced Ing, is accused in the slayings of
12 people between June 1984 and January 1985. Most of the charges
involve sex-torture killings at a rural cabin in Calaveras County,
east of San Francisco.
   He faces 25 charges in California, including at least 10 of
murder.
   San Francisco police detective Edward Erdelatz said in an
affidavit released by the court on Thursday that he interviewed Ng
in Canada about the slaying of one of the victims, Paul Cosner, a
San Francisco car salesman.
   After being advised of his rights, Ng said he had a meeting in
Cosner's car with Leonard Lake, who was also suspected in the
slayings, Erdelatz said in a sworn statement.
   ``Ng stated that Lake said he (Lake) had just shot Cosner, whose
body was in the car,'' Erdelatz said. ``Ng stated he then helped
Lake dispose of Cosner's body.''
   Lake killed himself in custody in 1985. Ng came to Canada and is
serving a 4{-year sentence for an armed robbery in Calgary, Alberta.
   If extradited and convicted, Ng faces possible execution in
California.
   Canada has a policy against extraditing anyone facing the death
penalty. The final decision rests with Federal Justice Minister Ray
Hnatyshyn.
   Reporters have been told that the hearing, which was expected to
last five weeks, possibly could end sooner.
   Allegations of torture and mass murder in the California deaths
have raised questions about Canada's extradition procedure. As
recently as May, California Gov. George Deukmejian urged Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to speed up the process.
   In a letter, Deukmejian said denying the extradition ``could have
the unfortunate consequence of making Canada a haven for death
penalty fugitives.''
   But Ng's Calgary-based lawyer, Don MacLeod, predicted it could be
a long time before Ng heads south. Regardless of the outcome of the
extradition hearings, McLeod said, an appeal is likely.
   The hearing has attracted widespread attention in Canada, where
the national news weekly Maclean's said the case ``will provide a
clear test of Canada's wilingness to return suspected criminals to
jurisdictions where they could be put to death.''
   Ng is being held at the maximum security Edmonton Institution
during the hearing.

<DATELINE>PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic policy officials of seven
Latin American nations with collective foreign debts of nearly $340
billion will meet next month, Brazil's treasury minister said Friday.
   Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega said they would work on a common
strategy for negotiations on debt forgiveness by creditor banks and
governments.
   ``I believe we've got to do something to reduce the stock of
debt,'' he told reporters during a break in a meeting of presidents
of the Group of Eight nations.
   ``This (debt reduction) is the way to make it possible for us to
develop our economies and to avoid social unheavals and political
instability,'' he said.
   Finance ministers of the seven participating nations _ Argentina,
Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela _ could meet
before year's end, da Nobrega said.
   Panama is the eighth member of the Group of Eight but was
suspended last February following the ouster of President Eric
Delvalle by Panama's military strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Details of the proposed economic meeting, discussed by the
presidents in closed meetings, were expected to be announed Saturday
in a final communique.
   Da Nobrega said the seven countries intend to negotiate debt
reduction rather than taking unilateral action. ``The countries are
firmly convinced that confrontation does not pay,'' he said.
   He also said the group has no specific plan in mind and will
examine ``every solution that has been put forward.''
   Last month, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said
creditor banks and governments should forgive 30 percent of the debt
owed by 15 nations, including all seven active members of the Group
of Eight.
   The agenda for the second summit since the organization was
formed in 1986 included strife in Central America, production and
trafficking of illegal drugs and trade imbalances.
   It was clear from the speeches made by all seven presidents
Thursday, however, that their deteriorating economies were the main
concern.
   ``Since 1982 the region has transferred to the exterior about
$200 billion in interest payments; the ratio of debt stock to total
gross national products exceeds 57 percent. These are incredible
figures,'' said President Jose Sarney of Brazil. His country's $121
billion foreign debt is the highest of any developing country.
   Mexico owes about $104 billion, Argentina $56 billion, Venezuela
$20 billion, Peru $16 billion, Colombia $16 billion and Uruguay
about $6 billion.
   Sarney stopped interest payments on $70 billion of Brazil's debt
in February 1987. On taking office in July 1985, President Alan
Garcia of Peru suspended relations with the International Monetary
Fund and said his government would pay interest only up to a maximum
of 10 percent of Peru's annual export earnings.
   Argentina has renegotiated its foreign debt three times since
1983 and is negotiating again with commercial banks and the IMF.
   On Thursday, the presidents called for a ``new dialogue'' with
the United States and other industrial nations on narcotics
trafficking and the conflicts in Central America.

<HEAD>IBM Re-Wins $3.5 Billion Contract for New Controller System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The temporary suspension of a $3.5 billion
contract with International Business Machines Corp. for the
modernization of air traffic control computers was ordered lifted
Friday.
   A three-judge Board of Contract Appeals in the General Services
Administration ruled against the Hughes Aircraft Co., a competitor
for the contract, which had challenged the awarding of the project
to IBM.
   The contract was the largest ever awarded IBM. At the time the
contract was awarded last summer, IBM had spent $233 million of the
Federal Aviation Administration's money and $80 million of its own
in the competition.
   The appeals board is a semi-judicial body that resolves
government contract disputes. It dismissed Hughes' contentions of
irregularities in the way the contract was awarded, including one
that the FAA gave preferential treatment to IBM by allowing IBM but
not Hughes to propose the use of used computers in the new system.
   Both IBM and Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp., had
competed for the contract to build a new, automated computer system
for the air traffic control operations. The modernization project is
to be completed in the late 1990s.
   The project calls for replacing voice communications between air
traffic controllers and pilots with electronic messages and could
lead to the use of land-based computers to actually direct aircraft.
The project was to be done by 1998 with further enhancements later.
   The Transportation Department selected IBM over Hughes on July
25. At a news conference announcing the award, officials said IBM
was selected primarily because it submitted a lower bid.
   On Aug. 10, following Hughes' protest, the contract was
temporarily suspended.
   Hughes Aircraft, in its challenge, asked that the contract with
IBM be revoked, arguing that the FAA and Transportation Department
had provided IBM with unfair advantages.
   Hughes accused the FAA of failing to follow a requirement that
said technical merits were to be given greater weight than price
when awarding the contract.
   Hughes also claimed several irregularities caused its price to be
inflated. For example, Hughes's bid relied on IBM to provide
computer hardware. But, according to Hughes Aircraft, IBM charged
Hughes substantially more for the hardware than what IBM quoted the
FAA for the same items in their separate bid.
   IBM, in a statement issued following the rule, said the decision
``upholds the fair process by which the FAA awarded the advanced
automation system contract. We are looking forward to resuming
work.''
   Deputy Secretary of Transportation Mimi Dawson said she was
pleased that the contract could now continue with the production of
equipment designed to meet increasing air traffic control demands
for the next 20 to 30 years.

   Bitterly cold air hit the northern Plains on Friday, snow fell on
part of New England and heavy rain fell along the Gulf Coast.
   The cold front that was spreading the coldest weather of the
season so far across much of the nation's midsection moved into the
Appalachians during the day and headed for the East Coast.
   East and south of the cold front, temperatures were in the 50s
across much of New England, and in the 60s and 70s from Maryland to
the Carolinas. Far behind the front, most overnight lows over the
northern Plains were in the teens and 20s.
   Five states had at least one location each with a single-digit
reading: Cut Bank, Mont., reached 1 degree above zero; Dickinson,
N.D., hit 2 degrees; Cottonwood, S.D., fell to 9 degrees; Valentine,
Neb., had a low of 7 degrees, and Burgess Junction, Wyo., bottomed
out at 6 degrees.
   Afternoon temperatures were freezing from Upper Michigan across
northern Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Dakotas to Montana.
   High wind and cold pounded the Great Lakes, with snow showers
over Michigan and northern Minnesota, and storm warnings were issued
for Lake Superior and northern sections of lakes Huron and Michigan.
   Just ahead of the cold front, high southerly wind blew across
eastern New York and Vermont, with one report of a gust to 56 mph in
the northern Champlain Valley of Vermont.
   Showers fell over eastern Pennsylvania, eastern New York and
western New England.
   Most of the precipitation fell in the form of rain, but snow fell
on some of the northern Green Mountains of Vermont. The Vermont
Highway Department closed Route 108 through Smuggler's Notch because
of the snow.
   Showers and thunderstorms spread over sections of the southern
Atlantic and Gulf coast states. The most widespread thunderstorms
were over Louisiana and southeastern Texas, and small hail fell in
the Houston area.
   Showers were scattered over southwestern Texas.
   While it was chilly over the Plains, temperatures were mild from
the Rockies westward. Laramie, Wyo., hit 63 and Salt Lake City got
up to 73.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 17
degrees at Great Falls, Mont., to 91 at Harlingen, Texas. Friday's
morning's low was 1 degree above zero at Cut Bank, Mont.
   For Saturday, snow showers were forecast over northern Maine,
Vermont, northern New York state and Michigan. Showers and
thunderstorms were forecast from the Florida Panhandle across
southern Mississippi and Louisiana to most of Texas.
   Highs only in the 30s and 40s were predicted from northern New
England across the Great Lakes region, the upper Mississippi Valley
and the northern half of the Plains to Montana and eastern
Washington; in the 70s from southern Georgia across the central Gulf
Coast region and much of Texas to southern New Mexico, and over
interior valleys of California; and in the 80s over Florida,
southern Texas and the desert Southwest.

<HEAD>US Aid Relief To Southern Sudan Waits Rebel Approval</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudanese rebels will not let U.S. relief
supplies into a starving, besieged town under government control
unless food also is delivered to a town held by insurgents, a rebel
spokesman said Friday.
   ``The food should be shared,'' said Richard K. Mulla. ``Why
should people in the area we control go hungry?''
   Mulla is secretary of the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation
Association, the relief arm of the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
The rebels began fighting five years ago for autonomy in southern
Sudan, which is largely Christian and animist, from the
predominantly Moslem north represented by the government in Khartoum.
   Rebels repeatedly have threatened to shoot down aircraft,
military or commercial, that fly over the south. They shot down two
commercial planes in 1986 and 1987, killing 73 people. and at least
two large cargo jets have been hit this year but landed safely.
   Mulla spoke to The Associated Press by telephone from his home in
a Nairobi suburb.
   He said officials of the U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) in Khartoum wrote to rebel headquarters in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, seeking guarantees their aircraft flying to Aweil
would not be shot at.
   Aweil, site of a government garrison 600 miles southwest of
Khartoum, has been under rebel siege for months. Sudanese officials
say at least 6,000 people died of starvation there during the summer.
   Mulla said the rebels agreed to give relief flights safe conduct
guarantees if supplies also were flown to Aton. Available maps do
not show that town.
   A man who answered the telephone at rebel headquarters in Addis
Ababa confirmed AID sought guarantees, but would not give details.
He refused to say when the letter was written or when the reply was
sent to the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa.
   ``They (the Americans) were told to contact me,'' Mulla said. ``I
don't know what they are waiting for.''
   Telephone calls to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi were not answered
and attempts to reach embassy officials were unsuccessful. The U.S.
Embassy in Khartoum was closed for the Moslem sabbath and its
officials were unavailable.
   An AID official, speaking in Nairobi on condition of anonymity,
said the agency still awaited guarantees from the rebels.
   Asked whether Sudanese authorities approved the agency's contact
with the rebels, he said: ``The negotiations were carried out from
Khartoum. I don't know the details.''
   The government of Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi has expelled
relief groups in the past for dealing with the rebels, who control
most of the countryside in southern Sudan. Army troops control the
cities.
   People are starving in southern Sudan because of food shortages
caused by droubht and aggravated by the war.
   The U.S.-financed airlift started carrying food and medical
supplies Oct. 13 to Mairam, Kadugli, Muglad and Abyei. Aweil is
southwest of Abyei and Mulla said Aton is southeast.
   Thousands of refugees from the fighting and drought have fled to
the towns.

<TEXT>
   The 101-year-old Jacksonville Journal
ceased publication Friday, the victim of declining circulation among
afternoon dailies.
   ``So Long, Jacksonville,'' read the banner headline.
   A run of 44,467 copies was planned when the presses at the
Florida Publishing Co. began printing Friday morning, but the run
was increased to 50,000 copies in the afternoon because of heavy
demand for the final edition.
   A group of Journal editors and reporters gathered in the
pressroom as copies of the final edition started rolling.
   ``I feel like I'm attending a funeral,'' said Perry Gann, the
press superintendent.
   ``Everything has been so somber and quiet,'' added reporter Sandy
Strickland, an employee for 19 years.
   ``I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach,'' said columnist
P.J. Tedrick, adding that she hadn't found the courage to open the
final edition.
   There were no ceremonies planned to mark the occasion.
   The front page and three other pages of the 116-page newspaper
were devoted to the newspaper's closing. Other features appeared
throughout the edition.
   ``The Journal has had a long and distinguished record of service,
commitment and leadership,'' wrote Publisher William S. Morris.
   The final edition also features a picture of crews removing the
Journal name from the building.
   The photo was taken by Pulitizer Prize winning photographer Rocco
Morabito, who retired in 1983 after 45 years with the newspaper.
   The Journal began publishing in 1887 as the The Metropolis. It
was renamed the Jacksonville Journal in 1922 when it was purchased
in by John Perry of New York and Richard Lloyd Jones of Tulsa, Okla.
   Perry and his son, John Holliday Perry Jr. owned and operated the
Journal until 1959 when it was sold to Florida Publishing Co.,
publiher of the The Florida Times-Union.
   Florida Publishing Co. was purchased Jan. 1, 1983 by Morris
Communications Corp. of Augusta, Ga.
   The closing leaves The Times-Union, a morning newspaper, as the
sole newspaper in the city.

   A pharmaceutical company that manufactures abortion
pills reversed itself Friday and agreed to resume distribution of
the drug after the government demanded it do so.
   The company, Roussel Uclaf, announced its decision after Health
Minister Claude Evin said the pills should be made available in the
interest of public health.
   Roussel Uclaf, partly owned by the French government, said it had
no choice but to comply.
   The firm announced Wednesday it was pulling RU 486, also known as
Mifepristone, off the market because of an ``outcry of public
opinion at home and abroad,'' and a threatened boycott of its
products.
   Evin, after meeting with company executives, issued a statement
saying France's 1975 law legalizing abortions must be respected.
   ``The drug RU 486 is an advance because it does not involve use
of an anesthetic. The precautionary measures to be taken in
administering this drug, exclusively in approved health clinics,
provides indepensible safeguards to women's health,'' Evin's
statement said.
   Roussel Uclaf is part of the giant West German chemical group
Hoescht, which holds the majority share. The French government has a
36 percent share.
   The government certified the pill for use under medical
supervision Sept. 23.
   Since then, 4,000 women in France have used it with a success
rate of 95.5 percent, according to the drug's inventor, Etienne
Emile Baulieu.
   In a statement issued late Friday, the company said it ``accepted
the (government's) order and would rescind its earlier decision and
would resume distributing RU 486 in approved health centers.''
   Roussel Uclaf repeated that ``no medical reason'' had prompted
its decision to withdraw the drug from distribution.
   Baulieu, at a conference in Rio de Janeiro of the World Congress
of Gynecology and Obstetrics, issued a statement saying he was
``very pleased'' with the decision to resume distribution.
   He said the pill represented ``immense hope'' for Third World
countries.
   ``It is a question of human misery, of life and death. It was not
possible to keep such an important advance in the drawer just
because certain pressure groups were against its distribution,''
Balieu said.
   Dr. Malcolm Potts, the president of Family Health International,
a non-profit organization that specializes in developing
contraceptives, is attending the Rio conference. He said a vast
majority of the hundredes of participants at the meeting applauded
when the French decision was announced.
   Potts said that after the session dozens of gynecologists
celebrated the move by ordering champagne in the restaurant of the
hotel where the congress is being held.
   Dr. John Sciarra, chairman of obstetrics at Northwestern
University in Evanston, Ill., who was attending the Rio conference,
said ``the congress received the news of the French Health
Ministry's move with enthusiasm.
   ``The general reaction at the congress was that the withdrawal of
the pill from the market on emotional grounds after it had been
tested for effectiveness and safety, seemed to be a very erratic
response.''
   In Washington, Kate Michelman, executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League, applauded the government's action.
   ``The French government has taken a strong stand against
intolerance and in favor of the health of women. We support this
action and the message it sends to those who seek to impose their
will on all of us,'' she said.
   Anti-abortion groups, including the Roman Catholic church, had
welcomed the company's decision to suspend distribution.
   Cardinal Albert Decourtray, president of the French Bishops
Conference, said Friday he was ``astonished that the government
intervened in such an authoritarian manner.'' He denied that the
church had pressured the company to halt distribution.
   Thousands of doctors attending the Rio conference had called on
Roussel Uclaf to continue making the abortion pill or pass the
patent onto another manufacturer.
   Health Ministry officials maintained the company acted to protect
its image abroad when it halted distribution. Company officials said
they had been inundated with mail from opponents to the drug in
France and abroad, especially the United States.
   They said many letters threatened to boycott company products.
   Andre Ulmann, a Roussel Uclaf official who helped develop the
pill, told reporters at the Rio conference a boycott would have cost
the company substantial sums of money, ``So we decided to stop
making the drug.''
   The pill works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone
essential in all stages pregnancy. Researchers say it is effective
in the first seven weeks of pregnancy, particularly when used in
conjuction with a second product called Sulprotone, or prostaglandin
E.
   They said the drug was not a do-it-yourself pill that could be
purchased over the counter and taken at home. Its use requires
medical supervision.
   Evin, in a television newscast, said of the threatening letters
received by Roussel Uclaf.
   ``It seems it is the fundamentalist movements that have already
protested at other times, notably in 1975 when the abortion bill was
passed.''

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas blew up eight
electricity towers, leaving about 20 percent of the country without
power Friday, the government said.
   The bombs exploded during a one-day general strike Thursday and
early Friday morning, said the minister of mines and energy, Oscar
Mejia Vallejo. He said sabotage of generators also contributed to
the blackouts.
   Among the areas without electricity were the Caribbean coast
cities of Cartagena, Santa Marta, Barranquilla and Riohacha.
Cartagena and Santa Marta attract hundreds of thousands of U.S. and
Canadian tourists each year.
   Other northern cities affected were Valledupar and Sincelejo. In
north central Colombia, the damage blacked out Monteria, Ibague,
Armenia, Pereira, Manizales and 30 other towns.
   Not affected were Colombia's three largest cities _ Medellin,
Cali and the capital, Bogota _ where one-third of the 30 million
people live.
   Guerrillas also blew up four bridges Thursday in the northern
banana-growing region and near the central town of Barrancabermeja,
the Defense Ministry said.
   Juan Martin Caicedo, the labor minister, said the general strike
called by labor unions was a failure. In a news release, he
estimated 95 percent of workers went to their jobs.
   El Tiempo, a Bogota daily, quoted union leaders as acknowledging
the strike did not meet expectations, but claiming 60 percent of
workers joined it.
   The strike had little apparent affect in Bogota.

<TEXT>
   An oil painting of two dogs sold for $180,000,
more than five times its original estimate, at an auction of art and
antiques widely reported to be from the collection of Claus and
Sunny von Bulow.
   ``Two King Charles Spaniels, a Landscape Beyond,'' an oil
painting by British artist Richard Ansdell, had a presale estimate
of $25,000 to $35,000. The 10 percent buyer's premium boosted the
total price for the work to $198,000.
   Sotheby's had promised to keep the seller's name a secret. But
curiosity seekers flocked to the presale exhibition last weekend
after The New York Times reported that the auction, entitled,
``Property from a Private Collection,'' would feature the Von Bulow
belongings.
   ``An 83-room mansion _ it's almost obscene. It's a world I don't
know of,'' said Evelyn Goldstein of Bayside, who attended the sale
with her daughter.
   The 509 lots featured English furniture and decorations, Old
Master paintings, silver and rugs, much of it very ornate.
   ``The silver is nice. But a lot of the things, I wouldn't like in
my house,'' Mrs. Goldstein said.
   Von Bulow has been living in Europe since he was acquitted in
1985 in a retrial of charges that he twice tried to murder his wife,
heiress Sunny von Bulow, with insulin injections.
   The offerings, which Sotheby's predicted would bring between $6
million and $7.5 million, were said to include furnishings from
Clarendon Court, the von Bulows' mansion in Newport, R.I., and
pieces from the couple's Manhattan apartment.
   Some sale items fizzled: Henri-Pierre Danloux's portrait of his
wife and infant son, which had a presale estimate of $300,000 to
$400,000, was yanked from the auction block when the top bid,
$210,000, failed to make the prearranged minimum.
   Other lots included a portrait by George Romney, which fetched
$396,000, below its estimate of $400,000 to $500,000; one by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, for $363,000, within its $350,000 to $450,000
estimate; and another by Reynolds for $220,000, topping the $120,000
to $160,00 estimate. All final prices included the premium.
   Diana Levitt, a spokeswoman for Sotheby's, said a big crowd was
expected Saturday, the final day of the auction.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Sanction Sears Store for Selling Lawn Darts</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Consumer Safety Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to sanction Sears,
Roebuck and Co. for selling lawn darts at a store in Puerto Rico in
violation of a consent decree with the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green refused to cite the company
for civil contempt of court and impose sanctions sought by the CPSC.
She cited evidence that ``Sears has taken all possible steps to
eliminate the sale of lawn darts in its stores.''
   The judge's decision, dated Tuesday, was made public Friday.
   ``This decision is especially gratifying because it acknowledges
our commitment to the consumer and to safety,'' said Michael Bozic,
chairman and chief executive officer of the Sears Merchandise Group
in Chicago.
   ``Sears was the first major retailer to discontinue selling the
product,'' Bozic said. ``In spite of these steps, we were unfairly
singled out by the CPSC because one of our 800 stores inadvertently
failed to remove them from sale.''
   The commission had sought the contempt citation after a random
survey of 20 stores found that Sears was selling lawn darts at one
outlet in violation of a consent decree it had entered into with the
agency.
   The consent decree required Sears to properly label lawn darts,
post large warning signs and take other steps to ensure that
consumers were warned of the product's safety hazards.
   The judge noted that Sears went farther than the consent decree,
ordering all of its 800 stores to stop selling the product. ``Sears
has convincingly shown that it has achieved substantial compliance
with the obligations imposed by the consent decree,'' the judge
found.
   ``While the court does not condone even a few non-conforming
darts in a single store, the fact that some such darts were
discovered does not obviate the force of Sears' commendable efforts
and it does not provide a basis for entry of civil contempt in this
instance.''

<HEAD>Hundreds Of Anti-Government Demonstrators Return From Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 500 people opposed to the
government have returned from border refuges to which they had fled,
and more are expected to reach reception camps by a Nov. 18
deadline, the government said Friday.
   Government spokesman Kyaw Sann told journalists the deadline
would not be extended but the government would ``make all efforts to
let the students know our intention to receive them back without
malice.''
   By Thursday, he said, 525 people had returned to their homes
after passing through 27 centers opened the government opened Oct.
14.
   They fled after a Sept. 18 military coup and brutal suppression
of a popular uprising against 26 years of authoritarian military
rule. Most went to areas controlled by various ethnic rebel groups
also fighting the Rangoon government.
   Rebel spokesmen say more than 8,000 students, professionals,
Buddhist monks and others sought refuge. About 5,200 of them are at
bases of the Karen National Union, which has provided some military
training, the spokesmen say.
   The government announced it would take no action against any of
those returning who had not committed specific criminal offenses.
   Karen sources on the Thai-Burma border cited unconfirmed reports,
however, that some people had been mistreated at the reception
centers. They said the alleged mistreatment includes forcing people
to run in circles until they drop from exhaustion and severely
restricting food and water.
   Kyaw Sann, the government spokesman, said 21 insurgents and 15
soldiers were killed in 37 clashes Oct. 22-27. He said the
skirmishes did not include those with the Karen National Union,
which is based along the Moei River between Thailand and Burma.

<HEAD>Political Analysts Say Botha May Soon Call General Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha may be
heartened enough by the overall results of this week's local
elections to call a general election in a few months, political
analysts said Friday.
   Botha's National Party lost about 90 communities Wednesday to
far-right candidates opposed to his ideas for limited desegregation
and power-sharing with blacks, but won in Johannesburg and Pretoria
and repelled Conservative Party challenges almost everywhere outside
Transvaal, the most populous province.
   ``There is enough positive news for the National Party in the
results to tempt them into a general election,'' said Richard
Humphries, a political scientist at Johannesburg's University of the
Witwatersrand.
   David Braun, political correspondent for The Star, the country's
largest daily newspaper, said support existed within Botha's Cabinet
for a general election in March or April, a year earlier than
required.
   Braun and other analysts suggested Botha may calculate that
despite its gains, the Conservative Party has shown itself incapable
of winning a national election.
   Experts interviewed by The Star said the Conservatives, who now
hold 23 of Parliament's 178 seats, could add 11 to 23 more if a
general election were held soon.
   Botha signaled his interest in wooing right-wing voters by
forwarding to the President's Council on Friday a controversial bill
to tighten enforcement of the Group Areas Act, which mandates racial
segregation of residential areas.
   The council, controlled by the National Party, has the power to
implement deadlocked legislation, such as the group areas bill.
Parliament's white chamber approved the bill but its smaller
chambers for Asians and people of mixed race rejected it. The black
majority is excluded from Parliament.
   Party leader Andries Treurnicht said his Conservatives will
resegregate business districts in towns it now controls. Chris
Heunis, the constitutional development minister, said only
Parliament can do that.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, urged Botha
to dispel the impression that his party was uncertain how to deal
with black political demands.
   ``The Conservative Party capitalizes on this uncertainty by
simply suggesting that whatever the government does or plans to do
will put another nail in the white man's coffin,'' The Citizen said.
   ``Many moderate voters would give the National Party their
support if it got its act togther and spelled out where it is taking
South Africa.''
   The Star said the local elections gave Botha two reasons to
proceed with reform: ``First, the Conservative challenge has been
brought down to Earth, and second, the considerable stayaway in the
black, colored (mixed-race) and Indian elections highlights a
vehement rejection of the present system of government.''
   Noting that Conservative Party supporters are less than 4 percent
of the population, it said: ``Reform cannot afford to be halted by
such puny opposition.''

<HEAD>Huge Arsenal Seized with Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police seized anti-tank rockets,
grenades, automatic weapons and explosives during raids that netted
14 people suspected of being Palestinian terrorists, prosecutors
said Friday.
   One security source said ``you could arm an army'' with such an
arsenal.
   Sources have said those arrested planned an attack in a foreign
country, not identified, but spokesman Alexander Prechtel of the
chief federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said Friday the
target's nature was not clear.
   A senior State Department official in Washington said privately
that West German police suspect the Palestinians planned to hit
American or Israeli targets, but he added that information available
to the United States was sketchy.
   Prechtel said 10 of the 14 detained in the raids Wednesday and
Thursday had been released, but did not say why or whether they
might face charges later. He would not name the four still held but
said they were men, two born in Syria and two in Jordan, in the age
range 35 to 46.
   Earlier official reports had said 13 people were arrested in the
raids on 18 locations in West Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt and Neuss,
just outside Duesseldorf.
   According to Prechtel, one of the Jordanian-born men had been
sentenced to life imprisonment in Israel but was released in a 1979
prisoner swap. He had gone to Israel on a terrorist mission in 1968
and was arrested after the explosives he was carrying exploded
prematurely, wounding him, the spokesman said.
   He said man the arrived in West Germany from Damascus, capital of
Syria. Prechtel said the four men kept in custody were suspected of
establishing a terrorist cell of the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command in West Germany and storing
weapons.
   Ahmad Jibril, a former Syrian army captain, leads the
Syrian-controlled Palestinian group, which opposes Yasser Arafat,
chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Western and Middle East intelligence reports say Jibril's men
have been assigned temporarily to Syrian and Libyan secret services
in the past to carry out assasinations and bombings.
   The Washington official said Syria's role with the PFLP-General
Command was a major reason for continuing cool relations between the
United States and President Hafez Assad's government.
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said: ``We commend
the German authorities for the outstanding police and intelligence
work. ... This demonstrates that international terrorism remains a
threat.''
   Chief federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann has taken over the
investigation of the Palestinians, Prechtel said.
   About the possible targets, he said in a telephone interview:
   ``We can conclude that we are dealing with an organization. We
can conclude that they were planning the most serious crimes,
including murder, but where, when, against whom and with what
motives is still totally unclear.''
   Describing what was found in just one Frankfurt apartment,
Prechtel listed an anti-tank bazooka, 25 grenades, more than six
pounds of TNT, several pounds of other explosives, six machine guns,
and other weapons and ammunition.
   He said police found many detonating devices, including a
battery-powered delay-action detonator, at an apartment in Neuss,
and seized false papers that included forged passports of several
countries.
   Security sources said privately of the men in custody arrived in
West Germany in recent months and the fourth lived here. They said
all had been under surveillance and ``we had them under control.''
   West German authorities had expressed concern about possible
terrorist attacks linked to the trial in Frankfurt of confessed TWA
hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a Shiite Moslem from Lebanon.
   Chief Duesseldorf prosecutor Jochen Ruhland said Thursday,
however, that ``we have no clues'' of such a connection.

   They said plainclothes police surrounded Werner Fischer, a member

Fischer was expelled from East Germany for six months earlier this
year for taking part in an unauthorized demonstration, but was
allowed to return in August.
   Church sources in Berlin said human rights activist Wolfgang Wolf
also was detained and others were warned not to ``disturb the public

   Investigators have determined it
was a 72mm anti-tank missile that hit the fifth floor of the U.S.
AID office, officials said Friday.
   No one was injured in the attack Thursday evening on the
six-story building, which is surrounded by a concrete wall about six
feet high.
   Henry Bassford, head of the local office of the Agency for
International Development, said police told him the projectile was
fired from about 200 yards.
   Bassford said the rocket damaged an external wall on the fifth
floor of the building in a residential district of the capital. He
said U.S. and Salvadoran AID employees were at work at the time but
no one was on the fifth floor.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but officials
suspect leftist guerrillas who have been fighting El Salvador's
U.S.-backed government for nine years. The Defense Ministry called
it an act of terrorism.
   Military sources said the rocket, known as a LAW anti-tank
missile, is a relatively small-caliber weapon readily available on
the black market.
   It was the first attack on an AID office, but the U.S. Embassy in
El Salvador has been attacked several times.

<HEAD>Say IRA Has Enough Arms But a Shortage of Top Agents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army has enough
Libyan-supplied weapons but is facing a shortage of top agents
willing to risk their lives, senior British military sources serving
in Northern Ireland said Friday.
   The sources, from headquarters in Belfast, spoke with the
condition they not be identified.
   They said that despite the IRA's problems, its terrorist campaign
was expected to continue, especially against British soldiers on the
British mainland and in Western Europe.
   ``The assessment is that they (IRA guerrillas) have come to the
conclusion that killing English, Scottish and Welsh soldiers causes
more pain and grief than killing Irish soldiers,'' one source said.
   This year IRA guerrillas have killed 26 British military
personnel in attacks in England and Europe.
   The source said it was impossible to say if the IRA is now
stronger or weaker. It began its campaign nearly 20 years ago to
unite Northern Ireland, a British province where Protestants
outnumber Roman Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Irish
Republic under a leftist government.
   The IRA is stronger because it is much better armed but it also
is weaker because its support in the Catholic community has
decreased and the number of people personally involved in its
terrorism has dropped, according to the source.
   He said six years ago the IRA would call off an attack if it
risked losing a ``prestige weapon'' such as a shoulder-fired,
rocket-propelled grenade, but an estimated 150 tons of weapons from
Libya have given the group a high-quality arsenal.
   The source said security forces in Northern Ireland have captured
about five tons of IRA weapons but it is believed most of the Libyan
shipments remain hidden in the Republic of Ireland with small
amounts smuggled across the border when needed.
   ``We believe that they've got the arms they need now to sustain a
campaign at the level which they've been running recently for a
matter of years,'' he added.
   The sources said the Libyan shipments have included heavy machine
guns, rocket-propelled grenades, quantities of commercial explosives
and Soviet-made SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles capable of downing
helicopters and other aircraft. No surface-to-air missiles have been
used in the Northern Ireland conflict.
   ``The critical factor at the moment is ... the people that
they've got with the bottle (courage) to really press home an attack
and risk their life,'' another source said.
   He suggested the IRA was short of such guerrillas because of
``war weariness'' and the possibilities of death or long prison
terms.
   ``Take the hardest of the hard core _ perhaps being the shooters
_ perhaps there are only 20 or 30,'' he said.
   There are others willing to plant bombs, store and transport
weapons and help the terrorists, but support for the IRA is
dwindling, he added.

<HEAD>Chambers Brothers, Five Others Convicted Of Running Drug Ring</HEAD>

   Nine of 10 people accused of running what was once
the city's largest cocaine ring were convicted Friday and a judge
said their conspiracy had been ``a serious threat'' to the community.
   The Chambers brothers organization allegedly supplied cocaine to
about half the estimated 1,000 drug houses in the nation's
sixth-largest city, and imported youngsters from Arkansas to help.
   U.S. Attorney Roy C. Hayes said the convictions won't have an
immediate effect on cocaine trafficking in Detroit.
   ``We're not going to reduce the supply in a case ... from 1983 to
1987,'' he said. ``But I think the harsh message ... will begin to
send a lesson.''
   Some of the 10 defense attorneys said they planned to review a
transcript of the trial to determine if an appeal would be filed.
   ``I think it is very difficult in these times for a person
accused of trafficking narcotics to get a fair trial as, say, a
person accused of murder,'' said Charles Lusby, attorney for Billie
Joe Chambers. ``I'm not saying my client didn't get a fair trial,
but I believe there's a bias in our community and it is very
difficult for people to set aside that bias.''
   Convicted of conspiracy were Willie, Larry, Billie Joe and Otis
Chambers along with Eric L. Wilkins, Elaine Coleman Lucas, Belinda
Lumpkin, Jerry Gant and Marshall Glenn.
   U.S. District Richard Suhrheinrich revoked bonds for three of the
defendants who had been free during the six-week trial, declaring:
``The court finds that this conspiracy is a threat, a serious
threat, to this community.''
   Paul Young was acquitted of conspiracy for allegedly hiring
teen-agers to process crack cocaine. However, Young already is
serving a life sentence for first-degree murder.
   Larry and Billie Joe Chambers also were convicted of running a
continuing criminal enterprise, involving the recruitment of
youngsters from Marianna, Ark., where the brothers once lived. The
recruits were brought to Detroit to work in cocaine houses.
   Those two brothers and Lucas also were convicted of cocaine
possession with intent to distribute, Larry Chambers was convicted
of a firearms charge and Willie Chambers was convicted of tax
evasion.
   No sentencing date was set. Maximum penalties range from 20 years
to life in prison and $2 million in fines each.

<HEAD>Quotes From the Presidential Campaign Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   DAN QUAYLE, hitting on Dukakis while touring Pennsylvania Dutch
country, renowned for its tasty pretzels: ``Mr. Dukakis has made
more twists and turns on the issues than any one of your pretzels.
Maybe that ought to be the symbol of their campaign _ the pretzel.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, deriding his opponent for shunning network
television appearances: ``Mr. Bush is out there in his little
cocoon. They won't let him out. We're taking our case directly to
the American people.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, saying Dukakis contends American families are better
off only because women have been forced into the work force:
``Frankly, that strikes me as sexist _ because it implies that women
wouldn't work unless they had to.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, telling Oakland high school students to work hard,
shun drugs, and vote: ``When you come right down to it, in an urban
area like Oakland, the war on drugs in our schools will be won or
lost by a series of millions of personal decisions made by students
like you.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, a day after pledging to end the campaign on a
kindler, gentler note: ``I ask you to consider: What kind of morning
would electing the liberal governor of Massachusetts bring? Will it
be gloomy. Will the dark clouds of pessimism and limited possibility
obscure our vision?''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, continuing to bank on a Harry Truman-like
comeback: ``In politics, as you all know, 11 days is an eternity.
There is time to do it.''
   
   CLIFTON DANIEL, Truman's son-in-law, saying President Reagan was
talking nonsense when he said the Democrat would be a Republican if
he were alive today: ``President Truman would shoot himself before
he became a Republican.''

   The National Liar's Hall of Fame issued
its annual Pinocchio Award on Friday to a farm columnist who said
the drought was so bad in Ohio that a Roman Catholic priest tried to
turn wine back into water.
   Politicians were ineligible for the grand prize won by Russell
Hoy, a columnist for the Ohio Farmer.
   ``We have a rule that politicians can't participate, only
amateurs,'' said Roger Welsch, the hall's founder and an expert in
Nebraska folklore.
   Even Vice President George Bush, who was to campaign Friday
evening in Omaha, was told to keep his distance from the competition
crowning the teller of this year's tallest tale.
   Well, actually, the liars just didn't bother to invite him.
   Entertainer Johnny Carson, who grew up in Nebraska, didn't show
up either, but he received special recognition for his
``contribution to the art of the tall tale'' during the induction
ceremony at Eric's Big Table Tavern.
   ``It's hard to sort out what's true and what's not in a Liar's
Club,'' said Linda Welsch, Roger's wife.
   Dick Cavett, another Nebraska native, was on hand for the
induction ceremony and received a ``public service'' award for his
comedy radio program.
   ``All my life I've dreamed of being here. Whoops!'' he said, to
the laughter of veteran liars.
   Hoy's winning lie said the 1988 drought was so dry that ``the
Baptists were sprinkling and the Presbyterians were using a damp
cloth'' for baptisms.
   He said, ``the Lutherans were passing out rain checks and at
least one Catholic priest was working at turning wine back into
water.''
   Championship lies honored the past two years were told by one
competitor who said he once met an honest fisherman, and another who
claimed he once saw a lawyer standing outside on a cold winter day
with his hands in his own pockets.
   Many of this year's yarns targeted the summer drought, including
an anonymous entry from nearby Central City that insisted
authorities had banned water skiing on the Platte River because it
was kicking up too much dust.
   ``Most people, deep down inside, like to stretch a story,'' said
Eric Nielsen, owner of the tiny tavern. ``I don't know why, but all
of us are guilty of it.''
   The 2-year-old Liar's Hall consists of three plaques on a wooden
wall near the men's room along with pictures of Presidents
Washington, Johnson, Nixon and Reagan.
   ``The pictures are there because of the old story that Washington
never told a lie, Johnson never told the truth and Nixon never knew
the difference,'' Nielsen said, adding that Reagan has been added
``because he forgot.''
   This year's event got a great deal of publicity, and organizers
worried about how to come up with an induction ceremony that would
satisfy the expectations of out-of-towners.
   ``The problem is, in the past the ceremony itself was all
fabricated,'' Mrs. Welsch said. ``It's really gotten out of hand.''
   A news release described the induction as the 37th annual event
and said it was attended by a crowd of 1,455 in white ties.
   Nielsen said he tried to discourage reporters from attending.
``We thought about telling them when they got here that it was
already over and we just lied about the time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A British tourist charged with setting a fatal Miami
Beach hotel fire was released on $100,000 bail Friday after spending
five weeks in jail.
   Tara Jane Terry, 19, of Camberley, England, is accused of arson
in the Sept. 17 fire at the Nassau Hotel that resulted in the deaths
of two elderly residents. A third person remains in a coma.
   Miss Terry faces a maximum of life in prison if convicted. No
trial date has been set.
   Her boyfriend, Mark Edward Richardson, 20, was briefly detained
as a material witness and has been free on $100,000 bond.
   According to an affidavit filed by a federal agent, Miss Terry
and Richardson were arguing when they arrived at the Nassau Hotel
the night of the fire. Federal agents and firefighters determined
the fire was set when she was in the room alone and Richardson was
downstairs talking to the manager.
   Miss Terry's lawyer, Richard Sharpstein, argued Friday before
Magistrate Linnea Johnson that a Miami minister and Miss Terry's
mother, Chrissy Terry, would be responsible for her if she were
released on bail.
   He said the minister has offered Miss Terry a job as a
fund-raising volunteer for the church and an apartment for the
mother and daughter.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edward Nucci made no objection. Other
bail conditions included a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew and frequent
reporting to court officials.
   Nucci said state prosecutors are conducting a separate
investigation in the case.

<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration should be congratulated for doing its job in fining
John Morrell & Co. a record $4.33 million for violations at its
meatpacking plant here, a union leader said Friday.
   OSHA conducted a six-month investigation after workers complained
and found the company did little or nothing in light of hundreds of
serious injuries to hand and arm joints caused by the repetitive
motion of the meatpacking line.
   ``We actually congratulate OSHA for doing their job. During this
present administration, we found that getting OSHA to do their job
sometimes was very difficult,'' said Jim Lyons, president of Local
304A of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. The local
represents workers at the Sioux Falls plant.
   The OSHA citation ``basically says that Morrell knew that there
was a problem. We brought that problem to them. We addressed it with
them many times. They knew ways of preventing it, and not only that,
we found their medical mismanagement to be incredible, a large
incredible problem, and obviously OSHA found our account to be
accurate,'' Lyons said.
   The OSHA report ``exposed the ugly truth about the health and
safety conditions'' inside the Sioux Falls plant, he said.
   Morrell is being singled out for penalties in what is a national
safety and health problem affecting many industries, the company
said. Chairman Milton J. Schloss, in a statement from company
headquarters in Cincinnati, called the fine ``grossly unfair and
totally unjustified.''
   The fine is the seventh time in almost two years that the
meatpacker has been cited for safety problems.
   In April 1987, OSHA fined Morrell $690,000 for alleged
record-keeping violations dealing with injuries. An administrative
law judge in Denver dismissed the fine this week, saying the statute
of limitations expired.
   In September, the agency slapped the company with a $28,900 fine
for safety violations stemming from a plant inspection last spring.
Morrell is contesting the citation.
   Workers have complained that Morrell has increased the speed of
its production lines at the meatpacking plant and that injury rates
have soared accordingly. Injuries and past OSHA fines have led to
segments on the TV news magazine programs ``20-20'' and ``West
57th'' and articles in major newspapers.
   OSHA officials said the incidence of repetitive motion-related
disorders at the Sioux Falls plant was nine times higher than the
industry average and 600 times the rate for all U.S. industries.
   Morrell, however, said the injuries that had to be reported fell
from 70.5 per 1,000 full-time workers in January, when it hired a
full-time safety director for its plants here and in Sioux City,
Iowa, to 16.75 in October.
   Morrell and the union have been at loggerheads dozens of times,
including strikes, contract deadlocks, lawsuits and appearances
before regulatory boards.
   The company and the union are in the middle of talks for a new
contract at the Sioux Falls plant. Morrell has asked for wage cuts
ranging from $1.25 an hour to $1.75 an hour, to a base rate of $8 an
hour. Union officials have said if the company continues to push for
wage cuts, a strike is possible. The contract expires Nov. 20.

   Two gray whales that were stranded in
arctic ice for nearly three weeks apparently swam to freedom Friday,
ending a million-dollar rescue effort watched around the world.
   ``There is no evidence of the whales in the immediate area,''
rescue coordinator Ron Morris said. ``I think the whales are
definitely gone.''
   North Slope Borough Mayor George Ahmaogak said the whales were
last seen at 8:45 a.m.
   ``They were looking good,'' Ahmaogak said after talking by radio
to Eskimos who had gone to open breathing holes for the whales. The
last sighting was about an hour before sunrise. Ahmaogak later made
an observation flight over 15 miles of the coastline south and west
of Barrow.
   ``I feel great. I feel like I got no more burden,'' said Arnold
Brower, the senior whaling captain who directed the Eskimo rescue
efforts of cutting breathing holes in the ice with chainsaws.
   Asked if he was confident the two gray whales swam to freedom,
rather than died, Brower replied: ``Yes.''
   Morris called the whales' survival chances ``pure speculation.
They had the will to live. They should make it.''
   Whether the whales survive probably will never be known because
biologists chose not to tag them with radio transmitters to keep
track of them.
   Brower said he was confident the two whales had reached the
channel cut by two Soviet icebreakers.
   If the California gray whales followed the icebreaker's channel,
they would still have to navigate ``leads,'' natural breaks in the
ice that vary greatly in width and close or open according to the
wind, about 200 miles to open ocean.
   Biologist Howard Braham, director of National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Mammal Laboratory in
Seattle, said he thought the whales could make the 200-mile journey
if they would get moving.
   ``This is an open water species, basically, and for whatever
reason, being in the ice is new to them,'' he said. ``They are not
adapted for it anatomically. They are in unfamiliar territory.''
   The icebreakers spent much of the night plowing through the ice
off Alaska's northern coast to slice another escape route for the
whales, originally trapped at a small breathing hole four miles from
open water. A third whale trapped with them died earlier.
   The Arseniev and the larger Admiral Makarov had been expected at
first light to head for their home port of Vladivostok. But their
crews reported they could stay to help, rescuers said.
   Rescuers had thought that after the Soviet ships smashed a
channel to open water earlier this week, the relatively young marine
mammals would have resumed their migration south. But at first they
did not move, and parts of the channel refroze.
   The temperature early Friday was 14 degrees below zero.
   When last seen late Thursday, the whales' condition appeared
worse after they had struggled through the slush and ragged ice left
in the icebreakers' wake Wednesday night and Thursday. Both bled
from multiple but superficial cuts.
   ``I think if they can stay in the small cracks and open leads
that are frequent on the front of the pack ice, frequently that ice
is thinner, and if they don't make wrong turns, they should make it
out. Still, they have some rough going,'' Braham said. ``They may
make mistakes.''

   Four guided missile frigates that
escorted U.S.-flagged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf returned home
here Friday, six months to the day after they left.
   The USS Halyburton arrived first, docking at 8:30 a.m. at the
Charleston Naval Base. Sailors were greeted by several hundred
family members and friends and a rainbow.
   ``How did you arrange the rainbow?'' one homecoming sailor said
to a reporter.
   Crowds also greeted the USS Fahrion, USS Nicholas and USS Robert
G. Bradley when those ships arrived shortly after the Halyburton.
About 800 sailors were aboard the four Oliver Hazard Perry-class
frigates.
   The four ships left Charleston April 28 to join the Navy's Middle
East Task Force, escorting convoys of Kuwaiti tankers and other
neutral vessels.
   Cmdr. Louis J. Giannotti commanded the Halyburton. ``This cruise
was fabulous. It was probably the most rewarding of my career. I
felt like I was really practicing my profession,'' he said.
   The ships responded to attacks by Iranian forces against neutral
tankers, conducted search-and-rescue missions and rescued two downed
helicopter pilots.
   The Halyburton also interrupted what appeared to be an attack
that was being mounted by five Iranian patrol boats against a
tanker, Giannotti said.
   Between July 24, 1987 _ when the Kuwaiti supertanker Bridgeton
struck a mine while under U.S. escort _ and the Iraq-Iran cease-fire
on Aug. 20, 1988, Navy ships and aircraft engaged in more than a
dozen armed clashes with Iranian forces and encounters with Iraqi
warplanes.
   On July 3, the missile cruiser USS Vincennes mistook an Iranian
jetliner for a military attack plane and shot it down, killing all
290 aboard.
   In August, a U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and nine other
warships steamed into the Arabian Sea to replace other U.S. vessels
in helping to protect Persian Gulf oil shipments, the U.S. Navy said.

   Teamsters President William McCarthy on Friday
defended his union's backing of George Bush for president, while
telling over 1,500 members he's prepared to fight to keep the union
a strong, unified force.
   ``Bush, I know, will do a good job,'' McCarthy said after
delivering a state-of-the-union address to representatives of 750
locals from around the nation.
   ``Dukakis, there's no way he can run the country if he can't run
the state,'' McCarthy said of the Massachusetts governor.
   Vice President Bush, the Republican candidate, was favored by
50.2 percent of the Teamsters surveyed in a recent union poll.
Democrat Michael Dukakis was backed by 46.4 percent of the union
members.
   The union endorsed Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. The AFL-CIO,
which the Teamsters rejoined last year, is supporting Dukakis.
   McCarthy, 61, of Boston, was elected head of the Teamsters after
the death of Jackie Presser in July. He is known to dislike Dukakis.
   Republican Gov. James R. Thompson, who briefly addressed the
meeting, sparked some boos from the audience when he said he was
there to deliver Bush's thanks for the endorsement.
   However, McCarthy defended throwing the union's support to the
GOP. ``The time has changed. No longer do you vote for the party,
you vote for the man,'' he said.
   McCarthy declined to say what tactic his union, the nation's
largest, would take should Bush, if elected, pursue the federal
government's lawsuit to force reforms on the Teamsters.
   The civil racketeering lawsuit, filed in New York in June, is
aimed at cleansing the union of alleged mob influence, federal
officials say.
   ``I'll cross that bridge when I come to it,'' McCarthy said. But
he added that he hopes Bush ``gives me what I want.''
   One of the delegates, Chuck Mack, president of Teamsters' Joint
Council No. 7 in San Francisco, predicted McCarthy is ``going to be
judged on the role he plays in contract negotiations'' and other,
more fundamental issues.
   McCarthy won points among the rank-and-file Friday for his vow to
play a hands-on role in bargaining and organizing.
   Evidence, members say, is the union's decision earlier this month
to abolish a decades-old practice requiring two-thirds ``no'' votes
to turn down tentative accords negotiated by its top leaders.
   The new policy requires only a simple majority _ any ``yes'' vote
greater than 50 percent _ to approve contracts covering the
international's membership.
   It is considered a major victory for the rank-and-file, said
Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth. ``They love it,'' McCarthy said in a
brief meeting with reporters after Friday's address.
   He declined to discuss what dissidents say led to the action _ a
lawsuit challenging a decision by top Teamster officials in May to
ignore a 63.5 percent membership rejection of a contract covering an
estimated 200,000 interstate truckers and warehouse workers.
   ``We don't have any problems,'' McCarthy said tersely. ``We all
love each other.''

<TEXT>
   A man who runs a home where 72 children
were removed amid abuse and neglect allegations pleaded innocent
Friday to charges of assaulting a police officer.
   ``I didn't feloniously hit them. I didn't double up my fist and
hit anyone,'' the Rev. Herman Fountain said before he was arraigned
in George County Circuit Court.
   Fountain and three assistants at the Bethel Children's Home were
indicted by a grand jury Tuesday on three counts of felonious
assault on law enforcement officers.
   The charges stem from a June incident in which the state took
temporary custody of 72 youngsters after a 14-year-old male runaway
testified that he and other young residents were physically abused
at the home.
   Most children have been returned to their parents. The state
retained custody of 17 who were ruled as abused and neglected.
   Fountain, 38, proprietor of the independent Baptist boarding
home, says he believes in strict discipline and the Biblical dictum
``spare the rod, spoil the child.''
   He maintains the state has no right to question his disciplinary
measures because he answers only to God. Church-run homes are exempt
from state regulation in Mississippi, but the state has the power to
investigate abuse cases.
   Fountain and his assistants were released on property bonds they
posted in June.

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers of the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact on Friday proposed an East-West summit to review
reductions in military forces and conventional armaments in Europe,
the MTI news agency reported.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the top diplomats
of the six other pact members _ Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, East
Germany, Romania and Czechoslovakia _ are attending a meeting that
opened Friday, MTI said.
   The official Hungarian agency said that in a statement issued
late Friday the ministers proposed a summit of all European
countries, plus the United States and Canaca, to review cuts in
conventional armed forces on the continent.
   The statement on ``confidence- and security-building measures and
disarmament in Europe'' also called for the banning of large
military maneuvers and reductions in the size, duration and
frequency of other maneuvers.
   MTI said the foreign ministers proposed:
   _Notification of independent activities by air and naval forces
and creation of zones of confidenece and security in Europe and the
adjoining seas and oceans
   _The freezing and reduction of military expenditures and the
establishment of a European information and contact-maintaining
center for the prevention of any surprise attack
   _Measures for the regular exchange of data about the armed forces
and their operations and for the exchange of information on the
structure and substance of military budgets.
   The statement said the proposals were meant ``to make the
military potentials of the participating states become strictly
defensive in nature.''
   Among topics to be discussed by the ministers is the conference
being held in Vienna to review compliance with the Helsinki accords
on European security that were signed in 1975 by virtually all
European countries and America and Canada.
   Earlier this month at the Vienna conference the Soviets removed a
major obstacle to proposed new talks on reducing conventional
weapons in Europe.
   Diplomats in Geneva said the Soviets reversed their stand and
agreed that tactical nuclear weapons would not be included in the
new talks between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and Warsaw Pact on conventional forces.
   The new negotiations would replace the Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction talks that have dragged on in Vienna for 15 years.

   From the sea to the Sierra, long lines
of Californians snatched lotto tickets at 10 times the normal pace
Friday as gamblers dreamed of overnight wealth in a record jackpot
that's climbed to more than $57 million.
   The top prize in the Saturday night drawing will bring the title
for North America's largest jackpot back to California, exceeding
the $55.1 million prize awarded by Florida on Sept. 3, California
Lottery officials said.
   Lotto ``6-49'' players were expected to spend roughly a dollar
for every man, woman and child in California Friday, with sales for
the day projected at nearly $30 million, said lottery spokesman Bob
Taylor. Normal sales for a Friday would be about $3 million, he
added.
   Some of the players needed the jackpot less than others.
   ``I come from a long line of people with money, but you know it
wouldn't hurt to replenish the bloodline, so to speak, with a little
new cash,'' said 53-year-old Dorothy Williams, who was standing in
line to buy five $1 tickets at a store on San Francisco's
prestigious Nob Hill.
   In contrast, Lee Tran, a 29-year-old Vietnamese immigrant
standing in a line of 10 people at a Market Street convenience store
in San Francisco, said, ``My whole family has put up money for our
chance to win the big jackpot. This is our dream. This is why we
came to America. To make it big.''
   Tran, who lives in a three-room apartment with eight other people
in the city's run-down Tenderloin District, was undaunted by the
1-in-14-million odds of picking the correct six numbers out of 49
numbers.
   In the Southern California community of Ojai, 70 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, Henry Anderson spent $100 on lottery tickets at the
Attitude Adjustment liquor store. ``I'm going for broke,'' he said.
``Maybe I am already, though.''
   The jackpot for Saturday's drawing was estimated in the
$55-million range Thursday after four previous jackpots had no
winners and were rolled over, or added, to the prize.
   With gambling heavier than conservatively estimated, the
state-run lottery on Friday revised the projected jackpot _ which
also is fed by sales _ upward to more than $57 million.
   The lottomania that has stricken Californians means almost
certainly that the figure will go higher _ perhaps $60 million _
before betting is cut off just before the televised drawing at 7:57
p.m., Taylor said.
   ``Sales are just fantastic,'' said Tom Licouris at Uncle Tom's
Liquors in the San Joaquin Valley community of Fresno. ``I've never
seen it start so early. This is the biggest I've ever seen. Since
they missed (having a winner) the other night, they've been coming
in like crazy.''
   Miles Turquist's 7-Eleven store in the Sierra Nevada community of
Truckee, 20 miles southwest of Reno, sells more lotto tickets than
any other California retailer because thousands of Nevada residents,
who account for 95 percent of his business, flock to his store each
week.
   Although Nevada has legalized gambling, the state doesn't have a
lottery.
   Turquist said that as usual he was keeping extra employees on
hand to handle the crowd. ``When lottomania hits, well, everybody
works and we've got lines out the store and down the street,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Senior Official Says Foreign Firms Safe from Economic Crackdown</HEAD>

   China's top government spokesman said Friday that
foreign investors now operating in this country will be protected
from a nationwide campaign to slash spending and cool off a badly
overheated economy.
   Spokesman Yuan Mu added, however, that the economic slowdown will
have some effect on foreign firms still negotiating new projects in
China.
   At the same time, Yuan denied reports of dissension among top
leaders on how to solve the economic crisis without crippling the
decade-old policy of letting market forces rather than central
planners guide the economy.
   Yuan is spokesman for the State Council, or Cabinet. His rare
news conference, for foreign and Chinese journalists, was apparently
meant to assure the outside world that tough measures to regain
control over the economy do not signal a reversal in China's overall
policies of reform and opening to foreign nations.
   Despite soaring inflation and other woes, ``the present economic
development in China is in the main good,'' he said.
   Yuan emphasized that China's decision to cut investment in fixed
assets next year by $13.3 billion will not affect foreigners already
doing business in China.
   ``All the contracts and agreements reached between China and
foreign firms will be honored. All projects of cooperation and joint
ventures will be carried out,'' he said, adding that ``we'll take a
policy of protection'' for foreign investors.
   In a meeting of its Central Committee in late September, the
Communist Party announced a two-year economic retrenchment to combat
an inflation rate of about 20 percent, a 40 percent growth in the
money supply, overheated growth, serious supply shortages and
widespread public corruption.
   Measures since taken include cancellation of hundreds of
construction projects, freezing of some product prices that had
previously been decontrolled, reassertion of government controls
over trade, and shutting down companies found guilty of profiteering
in scarce goods or corruption.
   Yuan said the measures were drawn up by all top leaders. ``It is
groundless to say that between principal leaders in the party and
government in China there exist differences.''
   Reports in the Western and Hong Kong press suggested that party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, the chief proponent of rapid reforms,
has been overshadowed by the more cautious Premier Li Peng as a
result of economic troubles linked to the reforms.
   The official press on Thursday issued details of Zhao's speech to
the September Central Committee meeting in which he supported the
need for economic stability.
   He said inflation should be brought under 10 percent. ``This is
the touchstone by which (we will) test the party's and government's
ability to lead and be in command of the situation.''
   Yuan said a five-year program for reforming China's price system,
considered key to the nation's economic future, will proceed next
year, ``but the pace will slow down.''
   He said the emphasis in 1989 will be on adjusting prices for farm
goods. A double-track system for agricultural and other raw
materials, in which the government sets some prices at artificially
low levels and others are allowed to float, is a major cause of
profiteering in government and business ranks.
   Yuan said all workers will receive raises next year, but the
level of salary increases has not been determined.
   He said that when local officials ignore orders from Beijing to
tighten their belts, the central government has the legal and
disciplinary means to enforce its austerity program.

   The right-wing Likud bloc will win the general
election or the vote will end in a stalemate, according to election
polls published Friday.
   The four surveys indicate Likud, along with its right-wing and
religious allies, will capture 56 to 65 seats in Tuesday's
parliamentary elections.
   The Labor Party and its left-wing partners are expected to take
46 to 55 seats, far short of the 61 needed to form a majority in the
the 120-member legislature, the polls said.
   ``There are two possibilities,'' political analyst and pollster
Hanoch Smith told The Associated Press. ``We can expect either
another Labor-Likud coalition or a victory by Likud, aligned with
its right-wing allies and the Orthodox parties.
   ``On the other hand, not very many people would predict that
Labor will be able to form a government.''
   The four organizations who conducted the surveys this week
provided no margin of error. Only one, the PORI Research Institute,
provided the number of people interviewed _ 1,200. Most polls in
Israel interview 1,200 people as a representative sample of the
population.
   One survey, by the Likud-aligned Modiin Ezrahi, shows Likud
taking 43 seats and its allies an additional 22 for a winning
65-delegate total.
   ``It seems that Likud will form the coalition, and according to
my calculations it will be a strong coalition,'' said Rahel Israeli,
who conducted the poll published in the Maariv daily.
   A poll conducted by Machon Yisraeli, an independent polling
group, shows Likud and its partners capturing between 57 and 63
seats.
   The PORI Research Institute, which is also nonaligned, had Likud
with a slight edge over Labor.
   ``It looks today that Likud is stronger than Labor, but no one
knows what will happen on election day,'' said Rafael Gill, director
of PORI.
   The three polls indicated more than 10 percent of voters were
undecided.
   If neither party can form a government, Labor and Likud could be
forced to join together in a coalition like the one created after
the stalemated 1984 elections.
   But according to Modiin Ezrahi, 46 percent of Likud voters and 58
percent of Labor supporters oppose continuing such a national unity
government.
   Smith said his surveys indicate that as many as 75 percent of the
general electorate want ``a decision one way or the other.''
   ``But a majority say a standoff or a Likud government will
emerge,'' he said.
   The Labor-aligned pollster Tatzpit said Labor's left-wing
grouping would win 55 seats, while the Arab Communist Hadash Party
would take four and other Arab parties another four delegates. Labor
has repeatedly refused to form a government with the Communists.
   The Labor Party has been losing popularity since December, when a
Palestinian uprising against the 21-year Israeli occupation erupted
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. More than 300 Palestinians and six
Israelis have died in the violence.
   Smith said polls indicate Labor was 16 points ahead of Likud in
December, but by June the two parties were running neck-and-neck.
   Likud, which opposes giving up any occupied land, has pledged to
use more force to end the uprising. Labor has said it will give up
parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in exchange for peace.

   Republican George Bush described
Michael Dukakis on Friday as a sexist who would torpedo prosperity
and bring gloom and malaise upon America.
   And that was just for openers the day after he resolved to wage a
gentler, kinder presidential campaign in its concluding days.
   ``Los Angeles is the movie capital of the world, and if my
opponent is elected the movie will be called `Malaise Two: The
Sequel,''' Bush said, recalling the word that figured in the
political downfall of President Carter.
   At a California town hall breakfast in Los Angeles, Bush stuck to
the economic theme he has stresse every day this week. One message
that didn't vary: his insistence that Americans are far better off
today than when President Reagan came to office in 1980.
   The vice president said Dukakis would scrap policies that work in
favor of new spending plans and probably new taxes. ``He wants to
torpedo the prosperity that we have worked so hard to achieve,''
Bush told about 600 people at the Los Angeles breakfast.
   He said the Democratic nominee contends American families are
better off because women have been forced into the work force.
``Frankly, that strikes me as sexist _ because it implies that women
wouldn't work unless they had to,'' Bush said.
   At the California Highway Patrol Academy in Sacramento, Bush was
received endorsements from two police organizations, the California
Correctional Peace Officers Association, claiming 18,000 members,
and the International Association aof Correctional Officers, which
says it represents 300,000 lawmen.
   Bush said that of all his differences with Dukakis, none is
``deeper and wider'' than on crimefighting, on such matters as the
death penalty, tough judges, prison furloughs.
   The GOP candidate said he believes that most of the policemen who
have endorsed his campaign consider themselves Democrats.
   ``A lot of mainstream Americans feel that the national Democratic
Party in 1988 just simply doesn't represent them any more,'' he said.
   ``You might almost say that the Democratic Party today suffers
from a split personality with a rank and file made up of some of the
best of America, the silent majority . . .'' he said. ``But the
leadership, much of it, is a remnant of the 60s, the new left, those
campus radicals grown old, the peace marchers and the nuclear freeze
activists.''
   Bush said he represents mainstream America.
   Any trend toward campaign kindness was marginal at most, despite
the resolution Bush offered in the euphoria of a Hollywood reception
Thursday night on the floodlit lawn at Bob Hope's giant estate.
   ``We're not going to be talking on the negative side any more,''
Bush said then. ``...It's going to be a kinder and gentler finish to
this campaign.''
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said Friday the comment did
not signal any change in campaign strategy or in GOP television
advertisements. ``He wants to talk positively, but that doesn't mean
he won't continue to draw contrasts to his opponent,'' Fuller said.
   The GOP nominee said voters should think of peace and prosperity
when they go to the polls Nov. 8. ``Peace means you can sleep at
night knowing that the world will still be there in the morning,''
Bush said. ``Prosperity means you can sleep at night knowing that
opportunity will still be there in the morning.
   ``But I ask you to consider what kind of morning would electing
the liberal governor of Massachusetts bring, would a Democratic
morning bring?
   ``Will it be gloomy? Will the dark clouds of pessimism and
limited opportunity obscure our vision?''
   In Omaha Friday night, Bush campaigned with Nebraska's appointed
Sen. David Karnes, struggling to hold a GOP seat against favored
former Gov. Bob Kerrey.
   He taunted Dukakis over farm policy,a recalling the grain embargo
imposed against the Soviet Union by President Carter. He said it
didn't work then and it wouldn't work now.
   ``I will never use food as a political embargo tool,'' he told a
rally at Omaha Civic Auditorium.
   On Saturday, Bush scheduled a six-stop bus tour in the Chicago
area, wrapping up the next to the last week of the campaign with
another push for the 24 electoral votes Illinois will award on Nov.
8.
   Bush said one of two men will be elected president that day.
``Only one of us is on the move and headed in the right direction
and that is me,'' he said.

   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd
Bentsen put aside negative partisan rhetoric as he finished a
California swing Friday, telling high school students to work hard,
to shun drugs and to vote.
   Bentsen visited Oakland Tech, a mostly black school which has
raised its national test scores and community standing with the help
of special programs for youths interested in health care and
computers.
   ``The fact that you are attending Oakland Tech means you have a
bright future,'' he said. ``And the best way to destroy that future
for all time is to become involved with drugs.''
   Bentsen said he and Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee, would launch an effective fight against drugs, but he also
said that effort would not succeed unless students did their part.
   ``When you come right down to it, in an urban area like Oakland,
the war on drugs in our schools will be won or lost by a series of
millions of personal decisions made by students like you,'' he said.
   The Texas senator returned to his home state later Friday, and
attended a rally of about 500 supporters in Austin. Bentsen
defiantly held up a reprint of the 1948 Chicago Tribune that bore
the front-page headline, ``Dewey Defeats Truman'' and told the
supporters, ``That's the kind of comeback we're looking forward to
having.''
   Bentsen was introduced at the California school rally by Sen.
Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and actor Danny Glover, best known for his
part in the movie ``Lethal Weapon.''
   Glover, who is black, told the students packing the gymnasium
that his mother, now 93, was kept from voting by discriminatory
practicies until she was 60. Apathy was not acceptable, he said.
   ``Too much blood has been shed ... to bring us to this point,''
he said.
   Cranston turned to the presidential race, saying of the
Republicans, ``They think the campaign is over. They're back in the
locker room.''
   Bentsen, who planned to vote absentee in Texas this weekend to
push a get-out-the-vote drive, made no mention of George Bush or Dan
Quayle. He urged the students to vote Democratic _ if they are old
enough to vote _ and to get their parents and friends to the voting
booth.
   The gymnasium walls were papered with signs welcoming Bentsen,
including one picturing the school's bulldog mascot wearing a cowboy
hat.
   In the middle of his speech, Bentsen suddenly stopped, as he
noticed the scoreboard. It was set up with the Dukakis-Bentsen home
team having 47 points _ the number of electoral votes in California
_ and the Bush-Quayle team with zero.
   ``I just saw the score up there,'' he said. ``That's great. It
convinces me even more the best America is yet to come.''

   A 72-year-old doctor who shipped human heads
and other body parts from Pennsylvania was placed on two years'
probation Friday, fined $35,200 and ordered to perform 1,600 hours
service in the city's prisons.
   Dr. Martin Spector had pleaded no contest to charges that
included theft of the body parts he received from morgue employees
at the University of Pennsylvania and Jefferson hospitals.
   Spector, an ear, nose and throat specialist, faced a maximum
sentence of 8{ to 17 years in prison.
   Spector's lawyer, Joel Slomsky told Common Pleas Judge Mark
Bernstein his client was a dedicated doctor for nearly half a
century and his motivation was continued medical research.
   It was brought out that Spector, over the years, had made about
$10,000 sending ear bones and heads to research centers in Colorado
and elsewhere.
   Slomsky, however, while acknowledging that while Spector violated
the laws of Pennsylvania, said his client didn't realize what he was
doing was illegal and what he received was minuscule.
   The investigation began more than two years ago when United
Parcel Service workers in Louisville, Ky., noticed something leaking
from a foul-smelling package. When they opened the box to repackage
it, they found human heads inside. The box bore Spector's return
address.
   Spector was one of five people charged in the case. Three of four
morgue workers have pleaded guilty and are on probation. Charges
against the fourth worker were dismissed.
   Before imposing the sentence, the judge told Spector that ``your
crime is the result of poor judgement. A donated body should be
respectfully treated and then properly interred. No one can trample
on the rights of those people in the name of science.''
   Under Pennsylvania law, bodies can be donated to medical schools
through a state affiliate knowns as the Humanities Gift Registry.
   Spector refused to talk to reporters after leaving court.

   Relatives of a cadet who needed a liver
transplant after his first day of state police academy training said
Friday they were satisfied by a probe that faulted the program, but
hinted that a lawsuit was in the offing.
   ``I'm pleased on the one hand, but not at all on the other,''
said Bruce Mendel, father-in-law of Cadet Timothy Shepard, who
remains in serious condition. ``We can show that there was intent to
harm the cadets.''
   Methods at the training academy in Agawam in western
Massachusetts came under scrutiny when Shepard collapsed, slipped
into a coma and had to undergo a liver transplant operation.
   He has since regained consciousness but remains unable to speak.
   Attorney General James Shannon said Friday an investigation found
a ``top-to-bottom'' failure by the state to protect the cadets. The
academy's physical training program was found to be brutally
vigorous.
   At least 10 other cadets from Shepard's class were hospitalized
for ills stemming from intense exercise and dehydration.
   Shannon said he planned no prosecution of trainers but called for
the chief of the agency to either resign or be dismissed.
   Gary Egan, the council's executive director, took a paid leave of
absence starting Wednesday.
   Mendel said he has learned that two state troopers who supervised
instruction at the academy called an ambulance before class began to
stand by during the first day of training.
   ``Doesn't that tell you something about their intent?'' he said.
   Mendel also said he would like to see other officials removed as
a result of the Agawam injuries.
   ``There were people to blame from the top down, yet they're all
still working and the one guy who is gone is still getting paid,''
he said. ``I hope he doesn't go too far because we're going to see
him in court and we don't want to go all over the United States
looking for him.''
   Egan's telephone number at his Wellesley home was unlisted. His
replacement, Acting Director James Canty, did not return a telephone
call to his office.

   Gov. George Mickelson remained in a hospital
Friday for treatment of a potentially serious blood clot in his
right leg, but he said he felt fine and expected to be released in a
few days.
   ``I'm going to be here probably through the weekend,'' Mickelson
said in a telephone interview from his room at St. Mary's Hospital
in Pierre. ``My leg hurts, but I do not feel bad.''
   An aide to the governor said Mickelson was running the governor's
office from his hospital room on Friday. The governor said he
expects to be back in his office by Monday or Tuesday.
   Mickelson said he was admitted to the hospital Thursday evening
after he noticed that his leg was swollen and called a doctor. He
said his leg is elevated and he is receiving medication to dissolve
the blood clot.
   The governor's physician, Dr. Thomas Huber of Pierre, said the
blood clot shouldn't cause any problems now that Mickelson is being
treated.

<TEXT>
   At least 120 demonstrators were arrested in three states Friday
as anti-abortion activists kicked off a weekend of protests calling
for pickets or blockades at abortion clinics in 32 cities.
   Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, whose group organized the
protests, was among at least 50 demonstrators who were arrested
Friday morning as they picketed an abortion clinic in Vestal, N.Y.
   Vestal Police Chief Frank J. Croom said those arrested will be
charged with resisting arrest and trespassing. Terry could face
additional charges, including conspiracy to commit a crime, he said.
   In Mary Esther, Fla., sheriff's deputies arrested 34
anti-abortion demonstrators who had blocked the doors of a clinic
operated by Family Planning of Fort Walton Beach. Those arrested
were among about 120 protesters who converged upon the clinic in the
Florida Panhandle suburb.
   Okaloosa County Sheriff Larry Gilbert said he sympathized with
the protesters' views, but not their demonstrations.
   ``I do feel we're being used. That's for sure. They do use us and
the media and they're certainly doing it now,'' he said.
   In Indianapolis, 40 protesters were arrested after they blocked
entrances to two women's clinics. Police said they were charged with
criminal trespass.
   ``It was very peaceful,'' said Wendy Snitko, a spokeswoman for
the Indianapolis Police Department. ``There were no problems with
any of the protesters, whatsoever.''
   The demonstrations marked a continuation of the anti-abortion
campaign that has resulted in some 7,000 arrests across the country
in the past five months. The campaign began in Atlanta in July, and
more than 1,200 people have been arrested in 20 demonstrations in
the Georgia capital since then.
   Bob Nolte, a spokesman for Operation Rescue, said the
demonstrations Saturday will be conducted ``Atlanta-style.'' The
demonstrators in Atlanta, most of whom came from outside the city,
refused to move from entrances to women's clinics, forcing police to
carry or drag them to police buses.
   Once jailed, hundreds declined to give their names or refused to
sign bail bonds, clogging the jail and court systems and costing the
city in excess of $500,000 in police overtime, jail and court costs.
   ``A lot of these people will be first-timers,'' said Nolte, who
runs a campus ministry at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
   He said Operation Rescue cannot control the tactics used in the
various cities but estimated there may be 4,000 to 5,000 arrests
across the nation this weekend.
   Jesse Lee, pastor of the Neighborhood Church in Manhattan, told a
news conference Friday that protest groups will hit 32 cities
Saturday and will range in size from three to 1,000 people.
   Among the cities Lee identified as targets were Jackson, Miss.;
New York; San Francisco; Dallas; Buffalo, N.Y.; Binghamton, N.Y.,
and Pittsburgh. The New York protest would violate a federal judge's
injunction against the group.
   ``This is not just a bunch of radical gypsies traveling around
the country, from place to place, getting arrested,'' Lee said.
``This is Smalltown, U.S.A., rising up against abortion.''
   In Phoenix, Operation Rescue director John Salvatore said about
80 people will ``intervene'' Saturday at abortion clinics when women
try to enter. He would not define what he meant by ``intervene.''
   ``It will be peaceful, but all of us are going to risk arrest,''
he said.
   In Wyoming, which has no abortion clinics, activists will mark
the day with a prayer vigil in Evanston, Nolte said.
   In New Jersey, about 100 people gathered Thursday at a church for
a rally and instructions on Operation Rescue tactics. Bill Koehler,
an organizer of the New Jersey protests, said he expects about 300
people to participate in a demonstration Saturday at a single
targeted clinic.
   In South Carolina, Sharon Pfost of the Pro Life Action Network
said 80 to 100 members of her group plan to picket all five clinics
in Columbia that offer abortions.
   In New Orleans, the Rev. Rod Aguillard said he expects at least
200 anti-abortion activists to risk arrest by blocking access to
five clinics. Another 600 protesters are expected to participate in
street demonstrations, he said.
   In Texas, protesters will go to clinics in Austin, San Antonio,
Houston and Dallas on Saturday ``to express our love for the
children who are scheduled to be killed that day,'' said Rex Moses
of Operation Rescue in Austin.
   The Texas Abortion Rights Action League, a group supporting
women's rights to choose whether or not to have an abortion, also
plans a rally Saturday in Austin. Phyllis Dunham, executive director
of the league, said the rally ``is meant to show just how much
community support there is for choice, and how little community
support there is for Operation Rescue.''

<HEAD>Soviets Mulling Increase in Foreign Share in Joint Ventures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is considering almost doubling the
share foreign companies can hold in joint ventures with Soviet
businesses in a major proposal to aid the ailing economy, a Western
diplomat said Friday.
   Under a Jan. 13, 1987, decree of the Council of Ministers,
foreign partners now are limited to owning 49 percent of a joint
venture, and the Soviet side 51 percent.
   Western businessmen said the restriction made it unprofitable for
them to form joint ventures, and they have been complaining to
Soviet officials for months.
   A senior Western diplomat involved in East-West trade said the
Soviets are considering a ``firm proposal'' to allow the foreign
partner to own 80 percent of the joint venture.
   The diplomat, spekaing on condition of anonymity, said some
Soviet officials indicate the foreign partner may even be allowed to
own more than 80 percent of the business.
   He praised the Soviets for acting on Westerners' complaints, but
said the principal problem with joint ventures remains restrictions
on how profits can be taken out of the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet ruble cannot be converted into other currencies on
world markets, so foreign companies must devise ways of either
earning convertible, or ``hard'' currencies, or taking out their
share of the proceeds in Soviet commodities.
   The Communist Party's ruling Politburo decided this month to make
the ruble convertible gradually, but no details have been released
and it is believed such steps will take years.
   Increasing their share will give foreign partners more control
over managing joint ventures and allow more Westerners to be brought
in as employees for the operations, the diplomat said.
   The proposed changes will have to be approved by the Council of
Ministers and the Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament.
   So far, the Soviet Union has signed 108 joint ventures with
foreign partners, most with Finnish and West German companies. In
addition, American companies have signed six joint venture contracts
with the Soviets. Soviet officials have said 300-400 joint ventures
are under negotiation.
   The Soviets have been actively seeking joint business projects
with capialist countries to help improve the quantity and quality of
consumer goods and to earn convertible foreign currencies to pay for
grain and other imports.

<HEAD>Newspapers Pull `Cathy' For Panning Bush</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `Other papers ..., to ADD two more newspapers
rejecting strip; picks up 5th graf: `The Oklahoma ...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Complaining that the comic pages are for comedy, not campaigning,
editors at a number of newspapers have refused to run installments
of the cartoon strip ``Cathy'' that are critical of the Reagan-Bush
administration.
   ``We don't think that our comics page is the place for political
endorsements on behalf of one party or the other,'' said Richard
Halicks, executive editor of the Messenger-Inquirer in Owensboro, Ky.
   His paper, which has not yet made its presidential endorsement,
said it will not publish any strips that take partisan political
stands.
   Other papers that have rejected the ``Cathy'' installments are
The Denver Post, The Evansville (Ind.) Courier, The Union Leader of
Manchester, N.H., and the Helena (Mont.) Independent Record. The
Daily Oklahoman went further, dropping the strip permanently.
   The Oklahoma City paper's managing editor, Frank Boggs, said its
management decided to discontinue ``Cathy'' ``for the same reason we
don't carry `Doonesbury' and we don't carry `Bloom County.'... We
don't pay cartoonists to do editorials.''
   The newspaper has endorsed Republican Vice President George Bush
for president over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a Democrat.
   The Honolulu Advertiser, while not dropping ``Cathy,'' is not
running the strips on its comic page. ``At The Advertiser, we
believe in Cathy's right to free speech; we'll run sample
`endorsement' strips tomorrow'' on the page opposite the editorial
page, its management said. ``Politics is getting plenty of space in
the rest of the paper; we don't want to spread it to the comic page,
too.''
   The paper has not made a presidential endorsement.
   The cartoon strip's criticisms are made by a character named
Andrea, who lost her job after having a baby because her business
did not offer maternity leave.
   In Friday's panels, Andrea complains the Reagan-Bush
administration has done nothing on several women's issues, including
equal pay, day care or impoverished single mothers. And yet, she
says, many people ``think things are going pretty well.''
   ``The government,'' she concludes, ``is like a baby. It looks
like a little angel when it's sleeping.''
   Contacted at her home in Los Angeles, the strip's creator, Cathy
Guisewite, said she anticipated her two-week political series would
generate controversy.
   ``I knew people did not look for the strip to be political
opinion,'' she said, noting that past strips dealt with the modern
woman's more personal problems, from inattentive boyfriends to
``cellulite and the disastrous bathing suit.''
   ``But I felt it was in keeping with the strip to comment on
women's issues that are at stake in this election. I really searched
my soul over drawing this strip. I knew I would be offending some
women readers I have who believe the extreme opposite.''
   Universal Press, a newspaper features syndicate that handles
``Cathy,'' received several complaints since the political series
began Monday, said editorial director Lee Salem.
   ``But it's that many complaints out of some 500 papers,'' Salem
said. ``I think that needs to be put into perspective.''
   Ms. Guisewite said she was not really certain why newspapers
would pull her strip and not others with a political point of view,
such as ``Doonesbury.'' But she said, ``I think people are having
problems with this series because I am coming out for a specific
candidate.''
   At the Evansville paper, managing editor Paul McAuliffe said,
``We are trying to cure the problem of a cartoonist using our comics
page to espouse a political view that is heavy-handed and in favor
of one party over the other.''
   He said the Courier was running two strips in the political
series out of sequence Friday and Saturday, and will substitute old
``Cathy'' strips for six current ones.
   The Courier endorsed Bush for president.
   The Union Leader ran an advisory Thursday on the comic page that
said: ``Readers looking for the comic `Cathy' will have to wait
awhile. Several installments scheduled for this week and next take
the strip into presidential political advocacy to an extent the
editor feels oversteps the strip's entertainment purpose. ...
`Cathy' will return as soon as she gets off her soap box.''
   The Union Leader's own editorial writers endorsed Bush.

   Pope John Paul II on Friday urged Christians
and Moslems to work together in their countries to spread the
message of peace.
   The pope spoke to a group of Moslems and Christians from Egypt,
Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and Sudan.
   The group ended a three-day meeting in Assisi on Friday that
sought to improve cooperation and understanding between Moslems and
Christians.
   ``The challenge before you is to spread the message of peace, to
practice peace in your homes and neighborhoods and places of work,
to make peace where there is none, to build understanding and
peaceful cooperation between Moslems and Christians in your own
countries,'' the pope said.

<HEAD>Captain's Attorney Says Language Barrier Led to Tragedy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A boatload of Vietnamese refugees that
reportedly turned to cannibalism after being left adrift by a U.S.
Navy ship weren't able to tell of their desperate plight due to a
language barrier, an attorney said Friday.
   The Vietnamese junk, which originally carried 110 people, had
been at sea for 18 days when it met the Navy ship. When the boat was
rescued 19 days later off the coast of the Philippines, it had only
52 survivors, officials said.
   The commander of the USS Dubuque, Capt. Alexander G. Balian, 48,
has been relieved of duty in connection with the June 9 incident and
the Navy is reviewing an investigation to decide whether he should
be court-martialed.
   Dan Donato Jr., civilian attorney for Balian, said the captain
told the Navy that the refugees were misled by an unidentified
Dubuque sailor's inaccurate assertion that help was on the way.
   ``In an effort to provide these people with some hope, he told
them that they would be picked up in a couple of days because the
Navy had contacted another ship to do that,'' Denato said.
   ``He was of Vietnamese extraction and, perhaps, spoke better
Vietnamese than English. I think that was, perhaps, one of the
problems,'' Donato said.
   Donato's comments at a news conference Friday echoed statements
in documents obtained by The Los Angeles Times, including Balian's
account of the incident and Navy charges against the captain.
   Crew members of the Dubuque, an amphibious ship, gave water,
several hundred pounds of food and navigating equipment to the
refugees aboard the junk after determining that the vessel appeared
seaworthy, Donato said.
   However, that and other information was wrong, he said.
   ``The refugees told me that there were people below decks in bad
need of food and, perhaps, near starvation,'' said Donato, who spoke
to a dozen survivors.
   ``But their understanding of sick or injured didn't include
starvation,'' he added, saying that crew was not advised of any
starving refugees.
   The crew and captain also thought the flat-bottomed boat had been
at sea for seven days, when it actually had been out 18 days, Donato
said.
   Survivors said a 12-year-old boy and a 15-year-old boy were
murdered and eaten, unidentified sources told the Times. A
12-year-old girl who died also was eaten by some of the refugees,
the paper said.
   Balian is charged with violating a general Navy regulation of
``wrongfully failing to render assistance'' to the refugees.
   The Navy also alleges that Balian was derelict in his duty and
negligently failed to investigate sufficiently and give appropriate
assistance.
   A recommendation on whether charges will be brought in a
court-martial is expected within a week, Donato said. An Article 32
hearing, the equivalent of a grand jury proceeding, was completed
earlier this week, he added.
   Donato said Balian sought vital information about the refugees'
condition and the state of the ship and acted properly based upon
the information he received from his crew.
   ``He did make these determinations, but unfortunately in the
press of things and because of the chaotic situation, he didn't get
exactly the right information,'' he said.
   The Dubuque was en route to the Persian Gulf and facing time
constraints, he said.
   ``He had to make a decision as to what was required under the
operational orders. You also have to remember he was anxious, he had
to make 18 knots in order to get to the gulf'' by the assigned time,
Donato said.
   But he said Balian's decision wasn't influenced by scheduling.
   Balian's Navy attorney, Lt. Cmdr. Ron Petronio, said Balian is
currently in Japan awaiting the Navy's recommendation.
   Donato said he expects some charges will be upheld, but the
decision for court-martial is up to Rear Admiral Geoffrey Chesbrough
at the Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines.

   A boy has confessed to releasing the
brakes on a boxcar that ran over and killed a railroad worker,
police said.
   Detective Sgt. John Teeples said the boy was under age 10 and
would not be charged.
   On Oct. 17, the empty boxcar rolled about a mile before it struck
a Burlington Northern work truck. The boxcar and truck then ran over
Kevin Evenstad, 35, of Fort Collins, as he worked on tracks.
   An investigation by Burlington Northern and police found that one
of six children ``released the brake, not understanding the
consequences.''
   A Federal Railroad Administration investigator said the lever
disengaged by the boy works similarly to a car's emergency brake.
   Attorneys for Evenstad's widow said they plan to file a civil
suit against the railroad.

   Three former top officials of a Provo
mental health center were charged Friday with theft and misuse of
nearly $3.5 million in public funds.
   Glen R. Brown, former executive director of Timpanogos Community
Mental Health Center; Carl V. Smith, former director of specialty
programs; and Craig W. Stephens, former director of administrative
services, were named in indictments filed by the state attorney
general's office.
   Brown, reached at his Provo home, said he had no comment. Smith's
Highland telephone number is unlisted. There was no answer to calls
made to Stephens' Orem residence.
   Attorney General David Wilkinson said the charges follow a
six-month investigation into allegations of financial improprieties
at the the center. Prosecutors charge that from January 1984 to
April 1988 the defendants transferred public money to themselves for
``alleged'' contract services without the knowledge or authorization
of the center's board or the state Division of Mental Health.
   The state charges that Smith averaged $31,243 per month in
unauthorized payments, Stephens $25,540 per month and Brown $9,990.
   The defendants also are accused of using the center's credit card
account to finance personal vacations and buy thousands of dollars
worth of jewelry, furs and clothing.
   The three defendants resigned last April after the legislative
auditor's office unveiled allegations of misappropriation of funds
at the center. Three staff members also were fired after the
revelations.

<TEXT>
   Two West Germans cruised the
Mediterranean on hot yachts, financed a madcap business venture with
stolen money and tangled up Tangier harbor before justice caught up
with them, police said Friday.
   The pair's wild adventures were detailed by police spokesman
Juergen Matthes in Gelsenkirchen, where both men had been sought for
nearly a year on charges that included theft and flight to avoid
prosecution. The suspects' identities were not disclosed.
   Police said the men's eight-month spree began early this year,
when they stole a vehicle to elude police in West Germany.
   This is the account Matthes gave:
   The two went to Majorca, in the western Mediterranean, where they
stole a yacht worth more than $1.5 million, but the engine promptly
burned up.
   Undaunted, they stole another yacht a short time later, this time
in Portugal. But first they broke into a store and stole a copying
machine and a typewriter to forge the ship's registration papers.
   They found they could have saved themselves the effort. When they
cracked the ship's safe, they found all documents needed plus more
than $5,000 cash in British pounds.
   The two fugitives generously handed out hundreds of bottles of
expensive whiskey found on board to police officials and harbor
authorities as they sailed around the region.
   But they ran into trouble in Tangier, on the northernmost coast
of Morocco, when the yacht's propeller became entangled in mooring
lines.
   One of the men donned stolen underwater gear and freed the
propeller, then swam in front of the yacht to keep it clear, cutting
all mooring lines in his path through the harbor channel.
   ``The result was total chaos in the harbor,'' Matthes said. ``The
fishermen were standing with knives at ready along the breaker
walls.''
   The fugitives eluded the infuriated fishermen, however, and
reached the open sea.
   On Spain's Grand Canary island, they decided to set up an aerial
sightseeing business, although neither had ever flown a plane. They
bought a rusting crop duster with money stolen from a currency
exchange.
   ``Neither of them has a pilot's license, although I think one of
them once sat next to his uncle in a cockpit when he was a child,''
Matthes said.
   The test flight ended in a crash-landing, but an experienced
pilot congratulated them even on that, saying: ``I couldn't have
landed here myself.''
   The yacht-voyaging ended when they ran into a storm while bound
from Tangier to the Canary Islands.
   One man paddled to land on a life raft, but he came ashore in a
restricted military area, was arrested and deported to West Germany
in August.
   His companion managed to steer the yacht into the harbor and
fled. He turned up broke in West Germany two months later and was
arrested by police.

   An earthquake registering magnitude

Friday, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations said.
   The temblor at 4:10 p.m. prompted a number of telephone calls

analyst Linda Hall.
   Hall said the quake's epicenter was located about two miles north
of the suburb of Granger and seismologists were continuing to study

   The Richter Scale is a gauge of the energy released by an

   Army troops on a training mission
discovered nearly 11,000 pounds of cocaine stashed in a cave in the
rugged Sierra Madre mountains, a military official said Friday.
   Mexican army Col. Salvador Bejaralo Gomez said the troops came
across the cocaine Thursday afternoon near the town of Buenaventura,
about 120 miles north of Chihuahua, capital of the northern state by
the same name.
   Earlier Friday, the Excelsior news service quoted a federal
police commander as saying that police had discovered the cocaine.
Excelsior said the drug was worth an estimated $3 billion.
   Bejaralo said he could not provide an estimate of the value of
the cocaine, which was stuffed in large canvas bags. The drug was
taken to an army base in Chihuahua and will be destroyed next week,
Bejaralo said by telephone from Chihuahua.
   Military officials did not know who hid the cocaine inside the
cave and no one was arrested, Bejaralo said.
   The Excelsior report came from Acapulco, where law enforcement
officials from 21 Latin American countries were meeting.
   The report called the seizure the largest ever in Mexico.
   The largest cocaine haul ever is 22,000 pounds authorities seized
in Colombia on March 10, 1984.

<HEAD>Report Soviets Move Advanced Fighter Planes into Afghanistan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has moved about 30 advanced
ground attack planes into Afghanistan, and the United States is
considering protesting the deployment, The New York Times reported
in its Saturday editions.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified State Department officials as
saying the Soviet MiG-27 jets arrived at the Shindand air base in
the western part of Afghanistan about a week ago.
   The MiG-27 is designed to attack ground targets with bombs,
cannon and missiles, the officials said. The United States learned
of the deployment from satellite photographs, administration
officials told The Times.
   One State Department official said it appears the Soviets are
getting ready for more offensive operations in Afghanistan, The
Times reported. However, a Pentagon official suggested the planes
might be intended to protect Soviet troops from guerrilla attacks
during the next phase of their withdrawal.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored accord singed in Geneva last spring,
Moscow agreed to withdraw its more than 100,000 troops from
Afghanistan between May 15 and next Feb. 15. United Nations
observers said the Kremlin met its pledge to complete the removal of
half of the troops by Aug. 15, but no major Soviet troop withdrawals
have taken place since then.
   Moscow recently hinted it might alter its pullout timetable from
Afghanistan because of alleged interference by Pakistan and the
United States. The rebels, armed mainly by Washington, operate from
bases inside Pakistan.
   Earlier this week, the chairman of the Afghan rebel alliance,
Burhanuddin Rabbani, said the Soviets were deploying new
high-altitude Tu-16 bombers in Afghanistan. The report in The Times
said State Department officials denied that assertion.

   Bosses and associates of the Genovese
organized crime family held hidden interests in a condominium
project in northeastern New Jersey and paid the borough's mayor $500
a week to help build it, according to an indictment unsealed Friday.
   The defendants set up at least seven companies, some controlled
by their wives, to obscure the investors behind the 60-unit Shelter
Bay project in Edgewater.
   Thomas Tansey, Edgewater's mayor from 1980 to 1987 and now
borough clerk, was paid more than $70,000 for two years to push for
the project, smooth its way and quash rivals, the indictment said.
   The organized crime figures also paid off Tansey's gambling
debts, financed his home and vacations and paid for an Atlantic City
hotel room, according to the charges. Tansey denied the allegations.
   The indictment returned Thursday said defendant Donald Ivaldi of
Englewood controlled the Shelter Bay plot despite declaring
bankruptcy in the late 1970s. Defendant Milton Parness, a convicted
swindler from Edgewater, offered to help in developing the property
in exchange for a share of the business, it said.
   Past problems meant they could not obtain bank financing, so they
brought Genovese second-in-command Matthew ``Matty the Horse''
Ianniello into their venture, the court papers said.
   Ianniello ``shared his stake'' with now-retired and jailed
Genovese boss Anthony ``Fat Tony'' Salerno. Salerno was named but
not indicted.
   The defendants deceived Fidelity Union Bank _ now known as First
Fidelity Bank _ into granting loans totaling $21 million to finance
the project, the indictment said.
   Parness, Ivaldi, Ianniello, Tansey and California developer
Nathan Weissman were charged with racketeering and various counts of
extortion, mail fraud and bribery.
   The indictment also alleged schemes to kite checks and extort
kickbacks from subcontractors.
   Tansey and Weissman pleaded innocent at an appearance before U.S.
District Judge John Bissell and were released on $25,000 bond each.
Ivaldi's attorney, John Arseneault, denied the charges.
   The other defendants and their attorneys could not immediately be
reached for comment. An appearance for the other defendants was
scheduled for next Friday.
   The indictment grew out of a 4-year-old investigation into
Genovese activity in New Jersey that led to the conviction in May of
Salerno, the retired family boss, and Ianniello in a New York City
construction industry bid-rigging scheme.
   Ianniello, Ivaldi and Parness were accused with Salerno and
others last May in a Genovese scheme to take control of a Morris
County sand-pit business.
   That case, which is pending, also grew out of the Genovese
investigation, which included months of secretly taped conversations
of crime figures in a construction trailer at the Shelter Bay site.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says ``Eternity'' to Go; Bush Says Democrat Would Kill
Prosperity</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS two grafs after 15th, ``President Truman..., to add
information on internal Dukakis polling.
^By RICHARD L. VERNACI</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis called the dwindling days before the
election a political ``eternity'' with enough time to pull off an
upset, while Republican rival George Bush accused him on Friday of
wanting to ``torpedo the prosperity.''
   The Democrat said the race was ``tightening up all over the
country.'' And he said that Bush, leading in the polls with 11 days
to go, was hiding ``in his little cocoon,'' with advisers afraid to
let him engage in news programs' give-and-take while Dukakis has
been appearing on many such programs.
   Bush, speaking to a group of businessmen in Los Angeles, said
that as Americans step into voting booths, they should keep peace
and prosperity in mind.
   ``Peace means you can sleep at night knowing the world will still
be there in the morning; prosperity means you can sleep at night
knowing that opportunity will still be there in the morning,'' the
vice president said.
   Despite a pledge to shun negative campaigning between now and the
election, Bush also stayed on the attack, warning that Dukakis
``wants to torpedo the prosperity we've worked so hard to achieve.''
   ``I ask you to consider: What kind of morning would electing the
liberal governor of Massachusetts bring? Will it be gloomy?'' Bush
asked. ``Will the dark clouds of pessimism and limited possibility
obscure our vision?''
   Bush also disputed Dukakis' assertion that American families have
been able to keep up financially only because more women have been
working outside their homes.
   ``Frankly, that strikes me as sexist _ because it implies that
women wouldn't work unless they had to,'' the GOP presidential
nominee said.
   Bush also spoke at the California Highway Patrol Academy in
Sacramento and received endorsements from the California
Correctional Peace Officers Association and the International
Association of Correctional Officers.
   In his remarks there, he said, ``You might almost say that the
Democratic Party today suffers from a split personality with a rank
and file made up of some of the best of America, the silent
majority. ... But the leadership, much of it, is a remnant of the
'60s, the new left, those campus radicals grown old, the peace
marchers and the nuclear freeze activists.''
   Dukakis wound up a trip to Missouri suggesting his campaign could
be struck by the same political lightning that returned favorite son
Harry Truman to the White House in 1948.
   ``In politics, as you all know, 11 days is an eternity,'' Dukakis
said at a morning rally at a Kansas City Baptist church before he
flew to Detroit. ``There is time to do it.''
   Truman's name has been invoked by both sides in the campaign, but
the late president's son-in-law said Friday the Republicans cannot
lay claim to his memory.
   Clifton Daniel, who married Margaret Truman, said President
Reagan was ``talking nonsense'' when he said the feisty Democrat
would be a Republican if he were alive today.
   ``President Truman would shoot himself before he became a
Republican,'' Daniel said in an interview with an Iowa radio station.
   Top campaign official John Sasso told reporters that polls taken
by the campaign showed Dukakis gaining nationally this week and
drawing within four points in the important state of California.
   Independent polls have shown national Bush leads of eight to 15
points, but Sasso said ``there is measurable movement this week'' in
Dukakis' direction. He declined to give exact numbers, but said the
margin of error was five points in the surveys.
   Dukakis' trip to the Detroit suburbs brought him to within a few
miles of the factory where the helmeted candidate's ride in a tank a
few weeks ago _ to show his support for building up conventional
forces _ turned into a public relations disaster. The Republicans
even used film of it in a commercial to ridicule him.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' vice presidential running
mate, was drawing upon the memory of fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson,
whose presidential library in Austin was the site for an evening
campaign rally.
   Earlier, Bentsen told students at Oakland Tech, a mostly black
school with a record of academic achievement in Oakland, Calif., to
apply their talent, stay away from drugs and vote.
   ``When you come right down to it, in an urban area like Oakland,
the war on drugs in our schools will be won or lost by a series of
millions of personal decisions made by students like you,'' Bentsen
said.
   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, took a bus
tour through Pennsylvania, trying to avert complacency that could
keep his ticket's supporters from going to the polls on Nov. 8.
   ``We're not taking anything for granted,'' he said.

   Just eight weeks after Florida's $55.1
million jackpot eclipsed lottomania in California, the Golden State
is back with a $55 million-plus jackpot that will be North America's
richest ever.
   Lottery officials and merchants said ticket sales for Saturday's
drawing already were double what an average Thursday would rake in.
   The official estimate of ``over $55 million'' for the drawing is
conservative, based on previous betting patterns in the two-year
history of California's computerized lottery game, said lottery
spokesman Bob Taylor.
   ``Over $55 million'' could mean several million dollars over,
officials acknowledge.
   It all depends on how wildly Californians react to the
1-in-14-million chance of winning the jackpot, which would be paid
in an annuity of at least $2.75 million before taxes for 20 years,
for the cost of a $1 lotto ticket.
   The size of the jackpot depends on sales and jackpot rollovers,
which fuel each other to produce the heavy gambling periods dubbed
lottomania.
   When no one picks all six winning numbers out of a choice of 49
numbers, the jackpot is rolled over, or added, to the top prize for
the next twice-weekly drawing. Four rollovers, including a $33.4
million jackpot Wednesday night, produced the current record prize
estimate.
   The exact size of the jackpot depends on how many tickets are
sold. Twenty cents of every $1 ticket feeds the jackpot.
   The California lottery produced a $51.4 million jackpot, North
America's largest at the time, in June. It was evenly split between
two players, an aircraft mechanic and a supermarket clerk.
   That record was eclipsed Sept. 3 by a $55.1 million prize in
Florida that went to a 63-year-old real estate broker.

   A reputed gang member suspected of gunning
down a policeman surrendered to a television reporter Thursday along
with a teen-age girl who allegedly drove the getaway car.
   The two were wanted in a Sept. 3 drive-by killing re-enacted
Sunday on TV's ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Kirkton Phenor Moore, 27, a reputed gang member, and his
girlfriend, Raylene Brooks, 17, were accompanied to the Hollywood
police station by KTLA-TV reporter Warren Wilson after surrendering
to him in Las Vegas, police said.
   ``He told me he wanted to turn himself in a long time ago'' but
feared he might be beaten by police, Wilson said.
   Wilson said Moore's mother called him about 10 days ago to see if
he would accept the surrender of her son. Wilson said he notified
police, and worked with them, but police would not say whether they
monitored the surrender.
   ``I felt confident this person was tired of running and wanted to
turn himself in,'' Wilson said.
   Moore proclaimed his innocence, but after watching the television
show, ``he was afraid if he didn't turn himself in, he wouldn't
survive,'' Wilson said.
   Officer Daniel Pratt, 30, was shot in the face while tailing a
car suspected in a drive-by shooting in which three people were
wounded, authorities said.
   Moore is charged with one count of murder with special
circumstances and four counts of attempted murder. The special
circumstances, murder of an officer, could result in the death
penalty. Moore's arraignment, originally set Thursday, was delayed
until Nov. 3, said Andy Reynolds, a spokesman for the district
attorney's office.
   Ms. Brooks pleaded innocent Thursday to one count of murder and
four counts of attempted murder in Compton Juvenile Court and
remained in custody.
   ``I feel a kinship with KTLA and Warren Wilson because they have
done something that we wanted to do but have been unable to do,''
said Police Chief Daryl Gates at a news conference. He said the
department also was indebted to ``America's Most Wanted,'' a Fox
Television production carried by 125 stations.
   The show has profiled 95 fugitives, and 48 are in custody, said
Jack Breslin, a Fox spokesman.
   The City Council and the Los Angeles Police Protective League
offered a $40,000 reward for the couple's capture, but a police
official said Thursday it has not yet been determined who will get
the money.
   Wilson, a Los Angeles reporter who has had three other murder
suspects surrender to him, said he wouldn't accept reward money.
   ``I don't think journalists should get involved with money like
this,'' he said. ``I consider it blood money; in this case, the
blood of a police officer.''

<HEAD>Nuclear Plant Leaks Radiation In Western Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear plant in western Japan leaked radiation
into the air, but not enough to contaminate the environment, a
company official said Thursday.
   The leak was in the Ohi No. 1 plant in Fukui region, about 200
miles west of Tokyo, an official of Kansai Electric Co. said on
condition of anonymity. The amount of radiation still was being
measured.
   He said the leak was detected when ``an above average amount'' of
radiation was measured in the 1.18 million-kilowatt plant during
testing of a valve in the steam generator.
   Radioactive water leaked into a separate circuit of water used to
condense the steam after it has driven the electricity-producing
turbines. The leak could have come from a tiny hole in the pipes,
but had nothing to do with the valve test, he said.
   Some radiation was released into the air, but should not reach a
level that will contaminate the environment, the official said.
   A radiation leak occurred at the plant in September 1981 when a
pipe was punctured, the official said.
   Japan's 35 nuclear reactors supply about 29 percent of the
nation's electricity, according to government figures. Fukui has 12
nuclear power plants.

<HEAD>Metal Fatigue In Landing Gear Caused 727's Belly Landing At Dallas
Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Airlines jet was forced to
make an emergency belly landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport last month because of metal fatigue in its landing gear,
officials said.
   Other commercial flights involving Boeing 727s have had trouble
because of similar metal fatigue, authorities said Wednesday.
   The crew of American Flight 135 could not open the jet's jammed
wheel well door on Sept. 21, forcing the plane to land with only its
nose landing gear extended. The 88 passengers and crew evacuated the
plane by emergency slide; three people suffered minor injuries.
   Problems with the pivot trunnion, the part of the landing gear
door that failed, prompted Boeing to issue a service bulletin in
March.
   The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the
Federal Aviation Administration then issued an airworthiness
directive concerning the problems eight days before the accident.
   ``Boeing was aware of the problem, the FAA was aware of the
problem and American Airlines was aware of the problem,'' NTSB
investigator Warren Wandel said.
   American spokesman Jim Brown said the airline had instituted an
inspection program for pivot trunnions on all its 727s after the
bulletin was issued.
   He said the plane used for Flight 135, which had undergone
routine inspections in August and September, had not yet been
checked for pivot trunnion fatigue before the emergency landing.
   Brown said all pivot trunnions in American's 135 Boeing 727-200s
and 39 Boeing 727-100s will be replaced by Nov. 15.
   In the March 31 service bulletin, Boeing recommended visual
checks of the pivot trunnions in all 727s, ``at the earliest
opportunity when manpower and facilities are available,'' but within
1,200 flight cycles. A flight cycle includes a takeoff and landing.
   Jack Gamble, chief spokesman for Boeing, said such bulletins do
not constitute mandates but contain strong recommendations to
aircraft operators.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Soviets Bringing New Planes, Guns to Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Afghan rebel
alliance said Thursday that the Soviets are deploying new
high-altitude bombers and long-range artillery into Afghanistan
despite their declared plans to withdraw.
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of the hardline Jamiat-i-Islami
faction and present chairman of the seven-party mujahedeen (holy
warrior) alliance, said he received the first reports of the new
weaponry Monday. He said additional reports confirmed them on
Thursday.
   The reports could not be immediately confirmed but Jamiat has
proved a relatively reliable source of war news in the past.
   ``This is a dangerous new political and military situation,''
Rabbani told reporters in the Pakistani capital.
   He said the bombers were identified as Tu-16s, known as Badgers
in the parlance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They are
among the largest twin-engine bombers ever built.
   Rabbani said his anti-Marxist, Islamic guerrillas also reported
seeing new, high-altitude jet fighters but he could not identify the
type.
   He said the aircraft, bearing Soviet markings, were observed at
the big Soviet air base at Bagram in northeast Afghanistan and at
Shindand air base in the west.
   The rebel leader said there also were unconfirmed sightings of
the planes at Kabul airport, which doubles as an air force base.
   Rabbani said the only logical use of such aircraft was to conduct
saturation bombing from inside Afghanistan. Previously, the Soviets
have flown the planes from inside the Soviet Union to bomb guerrilla
positions in northern Afghanistan.
   He said he also received numerous reports of new BM-41 long-range
artillery and a new type of mine distribution device.
   ``The BM-41 cannot be used against mujahedeen positions in the
mountains because they cannot be aimed that high,'' Rabbani said.
``Their only use would be against civilian targets.''
   Moscow recently hinted it might alter its pullout timetable from
Afghanistan because of alleged interference by Pakistan and the
United States.
   The rebels, armed mainly by Washington, operate from bases inside
Pakistan.
   Under a U.N.-sponsored accord singed in Geneva last spring,
Moscow agreed to withdraw its more than 100,000 troops from
Afghanistan between May 15 and next Feb. 15. The rebels did not take
part in those negotiations, but were represented by Pakistan.
   United Nations observers said the Kremlin met its pledge to
complete the removal of half of the troops by Aug. 15, but no major
Soviet troop withdrawals have taken place since then.
   The rebels claim to have taken five of about 30 provincial
capitals since the pullout began, and have begun hammering Kabul,
the Afghan capital, with rockets almost daily.
   The government has claimed steady military victories over the
guerrillas.
   Rabbani reiterated the rebels' offer to negotiate peace directly
with Moscow. They refuse to discuss terms with the Afghan
government, which they see only as Soviet puppets.
   ``We do not wish to disturb the Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan. In fact, we wish to facilitate their speed,'' Rabbani
said.

<HEAD>`Eastern Standard,' A Play by Richard Greenberg, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned. Philipp in penultimate graf is cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is possible? A good, even insightful play
about yuppies?
   Richard Greenberg draws a persuasive portrait of the
much-maligned y-people in ``Eastern Standard,'' his new comedy-drama
that opened Thursday at off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater Club.
   Alternately compassionate and caustic, funny and sad, ``Eastern
Standard'' marks the arrival of a major playwrighting talent who has
been percolating on the theater scene for several years. Greenberg
is best known to New York theatergoers for several one-act plays,
particularly ``Life Under Water'' and ``The Author's Voice,'' as
well as ``The Maderati,'' an examination of New York's trendy, young
literary set.
   With ``Eastern Standard,'' the playwright tackles bigger, more
ambitious themes. He mixes his materialistic and upwardly mobile
characters with such up-to-the-minute social concerns as the
homeless and AIDS. It makes for an intriguing theatrical
confrontation as his complaisant people face some unpleasant aspects
of their society as well as their own social conventions.
   Greenberg's hero is a nice, well-meaning architect named Stephen
(Dylan Baker). He's a quivering neurotic who has just attempted
suicide because he hates designing big buildings that are destroying
the quality of life in New York. But Stephen also has more troubles.
For some time, he has been trailing a female stockbroker, a creature
he worships from afar _ or at least from the next table in a
Manhattan restaurant, where the first act of ``Eastern Standard''
takes place.
   Stephen tells his troubles to his best friend, a gay artist named
Drew (Peter Frechette). They watch the stockbroker named Phoebe
(Patricia Clarkson) arrive and be greeted by a man who turns out to
be her brother Peter (Kevin Conroy). The brother, a television
producer, is also gay, and it turns out, is dying of AIDS.
   The plot turns on a foul-mouthed bag lady who causes a ruckus in
the restaurant. Since she's played by the feisty Anne Meara, it's a
spirited and funny assault that brings everyone together including
the waitress (Barbara Garrick).
   By Act 2, these six people _ including the bag lady _ have become
friends, even sharing Stephen's Long Island summer home. By then,
obsession has turned to love with Phoebe falling for Stephen and
Peter finding himself attracted to Drew.
   But there are drawbacks _ Phoebe's continuing relationship with
an unsavory old flame; Peter's knowledge that his fatal illness
could also kill Drew; the waitress' opportunistic attraction to
Stephen. The bag lady isn't all she seems to be either _ stealing
away in the middle of the night with everyone's jewelry and wallets.
   Greenberg's characters flounder when first faced with these
adversities, but eventually their doubts about life and about their
own abilities give them strength. It's part of the play's pleasure
to watch the characters work their way back to some kind of
accommodation with the real world.
   Director Michael Engler uses a series of sliding black panels
instead of a curtain to close each scene. It feels cinematic, an
effect enhanced by the theater's wide, low stage. Engler handles the
actors well, too, and doesn't allow any performer to dominate the
action.
   As the troubled architect, Dylan Baker has the most difficult
role. He must remain sympathetic and ineffectual for most of the
evening. Baker does both. Peter Frechette, as the gay painter, gets
the play's best laughs, and he seizes them in such an expert way
that they don't undermine his character.
   Patricia Clarkson displays the compulsion that makes her
ambitious stockbroker seem real, while Kevin Conroy manages his role
as the dying brother with an unnerving dignity. Barbara Garrick has
less to work with as the waitress _ the play's most enigmatic role _
and you are never sure if she is on any side but her own.
   Philipp Jung's restaurant setting is only generic, but his beach
house captures the flavor of a yuppie never-never land where nothing
can go wrong.
   ``Eastern Standard'' ultimately is a play about growing up _
adapting to and finally celebrating life, no matter what it brings.
As Stephen says in a poignant toast that ends the play, ``To all the
disappointments which are inevitable and compromises which are
legion and lies which are our daily bread (and) to the sadly
infrequent accidental happinesses of all the rest of our lives.''

   Pushing elementary-age children into rigorous
study in the name of reform is doing more harm than good, warns a
new report that lays part of the blame on global economic pressures
that have aroused competitive fervor.
   Recent reforms aimed at making students more accountable and
diligent may make sense for high schoolers, but often produce only
short-term gains when applied to younger children and may actually
burn them out, said the report being released today in Chicago at
the annual convention of the National Association of State Boards of
Education.
   The study, ``Right From The Start: The Report of the NASBE Task
Force on Early Childhood Education,'' urges states instead to
encourage formation of ``early childhood units'' catering to the
special developmental needs of 4-8 year-olds.
   ``The legitimate concern about the link between our economic
future and the quality of schooling has fostered a competitive
mentality for our educational enterprise, with unfortunate
consequences for early segments of schooling,'' the report said.

   Two of the chief consumer safety controversies
of recent years were before the federal Consumer Product Safety
Commission today, a proposal to ban lawn darts and another setting
voluntary standards for new all-terrain vehicles.
   Both issues have attracted widespread attention in recent years
with reports of deaths and injuries, congressional hearings and
commission investigations into the dangers of the products.
   The commission planned to ban the manufacture and sale of lawn
darts today, spokesman Dave Shiflett said Thursday. The action would
finalize a decision announced in July regarding the large darts,
which have been blamed for some deaths and an estimated 5,000
serious injuries to children.
   Action on the proposed ban coincided with an unfolding drama in
Tennessee, where an 11-year-old McMinnville girl was kept comatose
after undergoing eight hours of emergency surgery to remove a lawn
dart from her skull. The accident occurred as the girl was playing
the dart game at a neighbor's house.

   A reverse mortgage plan designed to help the
nation's ``house rich and cash poor'' would provide elderly
homeowners with up to hundreds of dollars monthly for the rest of
their lives and no need to pay it back unless they sell.
   The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance program announced
Thursday by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
initially will insure 2,500 no-payment loans to older Americans who
own homes but need cash to keep them up or lead decent lives.
   Under the demonstration program ordered in a 1987 law, the lender
takes an interest in the elderly borrower's property in exchange for
supplementing his or her income. The limited number of reverse
mortgages are to be available through banks and other lenders by
next April, HUD officials said.
   The mortgage principal, interest and insurance fees will be
collected when the house is sold or when a borrower dies, just as a
conventional mortgage would have to be settled before heirs could
take possession of a property.

   For years the U.S. Coast Guard has wanted to
buy a new icebreaker, but the Reagan administration balked at
spending $300 million and just this month scrapped the proposal
again. Then came the whales. Then came the Russians.
   The use of two Soviet icebreakers in a bid to save two whales
trapped off Point Barrow, Alaska, is prompting a renewed request by
the Coast Guard to bolster the U.S. icebreaking fleet.
   The Coast Guard now has only three saltwater icebreakers and one
of them is scheduled for decommissioning in January. The service is
resubmitting its request for money to build a new one to the White
House budget office, sources said Thursday.
   The sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
White House Office of Management and Budget earlier this month
turned down the Coast Guard's proposal to include $300 million for a
new icebreaker in the administration's proposed budget for fiscal
1990.

   Israeli parties are spending about $30 million
on the Nov. 1 election campaign, and a large chunk of that is
donated by people not even eligible to vote _ Jews who live abroad.
   The fund-raising process is shrouded in secrecy, primarily
because the law does not require public disclosure. But reports
indicate both the right-wing Likud bloc and the leftist Labor Party
have raised millions of dollars abroad.
   The U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith estimated
more than $50 million dollars may be raised by Israel's parties,
with one-third of it coming from the United States and elsewhere
overseas.
   Michal Cohen, spokeswoman of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres' Labor
Party, said most of the ``big sums'' are from abroad.

   The former CIA chief who documented security
problems at the new U.S. Embassy in Moscow says President Reagan's
recommendation that the building be razed and rebuilt shows
``reality caught up with us.''
   ``The United States has tended to be complacent over the years
about Soviet technology,'' said James Schlesinger, the former
defense secretary and CIA director whom Reagan commissioned to study
the embassy. ``In this case, Soviet technology turned out to be
immensely and impressively sophisticated.''
   Reagan on Thursday said he wanted to erect a new
``American-built'' embassy in Moscow in place of the virtually
completed eight-story U.S. building because of ``the many listening
devices that were built into it.''
   A State Department source said the government had filed claims
against the Soviet Union for $29 million in connection with
``defects and delays'' in the embassy construction.

   Authorities have detained dozens of
dissidents hours before a banned independence day rally in one of
the biggest police actions in recent years.
   Signatories of the Charter 77 human rights document and four
other independent groups have called on Czechoslovaks to gather
peacefully in Prague's Wenceslas Square this afternoon to mark the
70th anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence.
   Authorities have repeatedly issued warnings the past week against
those still planning to attend.
   To mark the anniversary of Czechoslovakia's independence in 1918,
authorities late Thursday announced a limited amnesty, saying they
were freeing prisoners serving less than two years, or less than
three years in the case of crimes committed through negligence.

   Relatives of people killed in airline
disasters receive less than half the compensation they should, and
the legal system gives the industry little incentive to improve
safety, a Rand Corp. study concludes.
   ``Compensation in aviation cases is neither fair nor adequate,''
said economist James P. Smith, principal author of the study that
surveyed claims and lawsuits involving 2,228 deaths in 25 crashes
involving U.S. airlines between 1970 and 1984.
   ``It's not adequate in that people don't receive full
compensation for their loss. It's not fair because people with
identical losses receive very different amounts,'' he said.
   The study by Rand's Institute for Civil Justice was criticized as
misleading by trade associations for plane manufacturers and
airlines, which had paid one-third of its $1.3 million cost.

baseball fans but set off two years of unrest.
   ``I'm so proud. We did it,'' said Lori Edmonds, president of the

hugging friends with tears streaming down her cheeks.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young praised the ``Hands Across UMass''

   In the first test of a new, tougher trade law,
the Reagan administration on Friday rejected a request from U.S.
rice farmers that it launch an investigation into charges that the
Japanese government is unfairly blocking rice imports into that
country.
   The announcement by U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
came as something of a surprise because supporters of the petition
were hoping the pressure of presidential politics would force a
different outcome.
   Yeutter called Japan's barriers against rice imports
``intolerable.'' But he said he believed the matter could be better
handled through a new round of trade negotiations now being carried
out under the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
rather than in direct confrontation.
   The administration had rejected a similar petition in 1986
because it wanted to give Tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban
on rice imports.

   A few legislators of the Supreme Soviet, that
traditional rubber stamp for the leadership, made history Friday
night by voting against decrees restricting street demonstrations.
   They lost by more than 1,300 votes because they were 31 at most
and the other members behaved in the customary manner.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has encouraged debate in his
campaign for more democracy, watched from the dais with other
government and Communist Party leaders.
   Votes are taken by show of hands, usually all hands for whatever
measures the parliament's ruling Presidium adopts between
twice-yearly sessions.
   Despite overwhelming support for the laws by Supreme Soviet
deputies, hundreds of them laughed or smiled as Soviet photographers
rushed to record the spectacle of legislators voting no. Dissenters
kept their hands up long enough for functionaries to rush around and
count.

<HEAD>French Labor Movement Low in Membership But High in Profile</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France's labor unions _ feeble in membership,
splintered in politics _ have kept a knack for grabbing attention
and embarrassing governments.
   A ``Day of Action'' Oct. 20 by public employees dominated the
news and put pressure on the government of Premier Michel Rocard, a
socialist, to do something to restore what is known as ``social
peace.''
   Workers thronged Paris' wide boulevards, marching under angry
banners by the tens of thousands. Teachers closed their books,
postmen dropped their mailbags, and transit passengers were left
crowded on train and subway platforms waiting for the occasional
ride.
   Union leaders said they would consider stepping up the pressure
for pay raises with more strikes.
   The impression is of a powerful and united labor movement, but
the reality is five national federations split along political
lines, all suffering from falling membership and accused of losing
touch with the workers.
   ``It's a very complicated movement,'' said Rene Mouriaux, who
specializes in unions at the Paris-based Center for the Study of
French Political Life.
   ``It has the lowest rate of union membership in Europe, but the
ability to mobilize people is relatively great,'' he said in an
interview. ``They have an ability to make themselves heard that goes
beyond their ability to organize.''
   Reliable figures on membership are scarce. The claims by the
different union federations are widely believed to be overstated.
   Mouriaux said the best estimate he could offer, after extensive
study, was that 9 percent to 13 percent of France's 17.8 million
salaried workers have union cards.
   State-owned enterprises and the civil service are much more
heavily organized than private business, but any precise figures on
the breakdown are ``poetry,'' he said, rather than science.
   As membership dwindles, union leaders more frequently lose
control of angry workers. Many recent strikes, including one by
nurses, have been led by ad-hoc committees, bypassing the existing
unions who counseled patience.
   Roughly one-fourth of union members belong to the communist-led
General Confederation of Labor, known by its French initials CGT. It
claimed 1.6 million active and retired members in 1983, the last
time it disclosed a figure, but the independent newspaper Le Monde
estimated the CGT's real membership then at about 890,000.
   The second-biggest union is the French Democratic Confederation
of Labor (CFTD), close to the socialists; followed by Workers Force
(FO), which broke from the CGT when the latter became
communist-dominated in the late 1940s; the General Confederation of
Cadres (CGC), made up mostly of technicians, engineers and
middle-management; and the French Confederation of Christian Workers
(CFDC), no longer strictly religious.
   Most single-profession unions are affiliated with one of the big
federations, with the notable exception of the powerful National
Education Federation, which is dominant among public school teachers.
   The CGT has maintained its leadership, even while support for the
French Communist Party has dwindled to less than 10 percent of the
electorate, from its postwar position as the strongest party on the
left.
   The CGT's reputation as the toughest union, taking the hardest
line against the companies and the government, attracts workers who
would never vote communist.
   But even the CGT has suffered in the past 15 years, especially
from widespread layoffs in the hard-hit industries that used to be
its strongholds _ the mines, shipyards and steelworks.
   Although membership is low, unions have a secure place in French
law. Union representatives are involved in managing the social
security system, negotiating national contracts and in ``enterprise
committees'' that large businesses are required to establish.
   In the current standoff, the unions are demanding
across-the-board wage increases for public employees to keep up with
the cost of living, while the government says no money will be
available before next year.
   The situation is all the more uncomfortable for the socialists,
who took over the government in May from conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac. The union members overwhelmingly vote socialist, and
socialist leaders are more at ease supporting the union demands.
   ``The left in power finds itself on both sides of the
barricades,'' the leftist newspaper Liberation wrote recently. ``The
socialists are in a good position to understand the appeal of the
civil servants _ these constitute their natural sociological domain,
reservoir of voters but also of activists and leaders.''
   While there are sometimes long strikes in private industry,
French unions are better-known for work stoppages lasting one day at
a time _ or even less _ intended as a show of force during
negotiations, rather than as a final blow when talks have failed.
   Workers who provide essential services, such as nurses and
air-traffic controllers, are required to provide a minimum level of
service even when they strike.
   Rarely does business come completely to a halt.

<HEAD>Labor Leaders' Internal Exile Upsets Chilean Business Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARRAL, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Within the limits of this sleepy,
conservative farming community, Chile's top labor leader resides in
court-ordered internal exile that has been criticized even by his
foes in big business.
   Manuel Bustos, president of the Workers' United Central, Chile's
main trade union confederation, was driven in a police car late on
the night of Sept. 15 from the capital city, Santiago, to Parral,
210 miles to the south. He hasn't stepped outside the town since and
legally cannot until February 1990.
   His confinement has been denounced by labor and human rights
organizations worldwide.
   Appeals for his release rose in number and volume after voters in
a yes-or-no referendum Oct. 5 rejected Gen. Augusto Pinochet's bid
to remain on as Chile's president until 1997.
   Bustos, a 42-year-old textile worker, harbors hopes that
Pinochet's ballot-box loss will bring him freedom soon.
   ``Maybe during the Christmas season, there will be an amnesty,''
he said in an interview. ``At least I can have my illusions, can't
I?''
   His sentence of 541 days' ``relegation'' to Parral was ordered by
the Supreme Court, which convicted him and other confederation
leaders of violating internal security laws by calling a general
strike that turned violent a little more than a year ago.
   The court ordered an identical sentence for the confederation's
vice president, Arturo Martinez, who is confined to Chanaral, a town
in northern Chile.
   Following Pinochet's defeat in the Oct. 5 referendum, a 16-party
opposition coalition called for the release of Bustos and Martinez.
Leading businessmen, including several who had supported Pinochet,
echoed the appeal.
   Manuel Feliu, president of the Production and Commerce
Federation, a national business organization, said an amnesty for
the two labor leaders ``would be a sign of grandeur and of
reconciliation, which is what the country needs now.''
   Bustos said Feliu's statement reflects the realization by
businessmen that elected rule will bring an end to what he described
as pro-business labor laws they enjoyed under Pinochet.
   Pinochet remains as president but must step down in 1990 after an
open presidential election.
   ``They now see that the time is getting close when things are
going to have to change some,'' Bustos said. ``They're a little
anxious to start some kind of dialogue.''
   He accused business leaders of being ``two-faced,'' calling for
reforms in a publicity bid for workers' sympathies while ``using and
abusing'' the current laws.
   ``Change is going to come, whether they like it or not,'' he
added.
   Upon seizing power in a bloody 1973 coup, Pinochet dismantled the
country's powerful, mostly leftist-led labor unions. Leaders were
imprisoned, expelled and, in several cases, tortured and killed.
Pinochet's military government drafted laws that prohibit
industrywide collective bargaining, limiting salary negotiations to
individual locals.
   Strikes are illegal in a wide range of industries considered
strategic, including copper mining, which provides up to half the
country's export income. In areas where strikes are permitted, law
requires that bargaining follow a strict timetable and be conluded
within 60 days. If not, the company's original contract goes back
into effect.
   Several international and foreign organizations have criticized
the laws as unfair, including the U.S. government, which last year
suspended Chile's special trade status because of restrictions
against organized labor.
   Bustos said businessmen also realize that a genuine dialogue with
labor cannot begin until his and Martinez' internal exile ends.
   ``These relegations are an obstacle to conversations'' and tend
to make the confederation more radical, he said.
   Bustos is a member of the Christian Democratic Party, the
country's largest political organization. Although he backs a
left-of-center faction of the party and has often taken a strongly
combative stance against the Pinochet government, he is considered
politically moderate in comparison with many other labor activists.
   ``I believe the only way you can reach an understanding with
people is through conversation,'' he said. ``I have always tried to
talk with business leaders.''
   Bustos does not rule out demonstrations or perhaps a general
strike by workers, however, if Pinochet fails to respond promptly to
opposition calls for democratic concessions.
   ``We have to think about an orderly mobilization ... to warn the
regime that indeed we have strength,'' he said.
   During his first weeks in internal exile, a regular stream of
visitors, including labor leaders and journalists, have called at
the working-class residence of a local Roman Catholic priest where
Bustos is staying. His wife, a journalist in Santiago, comes each
weekend with his 5-year-old son, he said. The couple also has two
teen-age daughters.
   He has become involved in protecting the rights of workers in the
Parral area, ``where there are some 7,000 workers and not one single
union,'' he said. He plans to open an office, with a secretary and a
lawyer, to represent workers in suits against employers.
   ``I've kept busy,'' he said. ``I brought a book with me, and in
all this time I still haven't finished it.''
   He said the book was about recent social reforms in the Soviet
Union.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The makers of the CBS version of the hit movie
``Dirty Dancing'' can at least brag that they have successfully
adapted a simplistic, cliche-ridden movie into a simplistic,
cliche-ridden television series.
   ``Dirty Dancing'' premieres Saturday with a one-hour episode,
then continues as a half-hour show.
   The movie, a variation on the worn
rich-girl-falls-for-sexy-boy-from-wrong-side-of-tracks plot, was a
hit thanks to hot dancing, great early '60s music and two charming
stars, Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze. The TV series has some good
music and dancing, and at least one charming star _ Melora Hardin in
the Grey role as Baby.
   In the movie, the plot was an excuse for loads of scenes of
sensuous dancers writhing to hits from the '60s. On TV, choreography
is money, so there's less dance, more talk.
   To allow for a continuing plotline, the series has the option of
going beyond summer vacation, since Baby (Hardin) is no longer the
daughter of a vacationing doctor but the daughter of the divorced
owner of the resort, Max Kellerman (McLean Stevenson).
   Hardin has a winning presence, but Patrick Cassidy has a long way
to go to live up to Patrick Swayze in the role of Johnny. Swayze
managed to give the guy some depth despite the movie's ankle-deep
plot.
   Cassidy's Johnny is a self-centered, humorless dunce who dances
around alone in his room rubbing his body. Granted, Cassidy didn't
write or direct such scenes, but Swayze didn't exactly have
``Macbeth'' to work with, either.
   In the opener, Baby arrives to spend the summer getting to know
Dad. Wandering about, she discovers Johnny's dancers rehearsing one
of their ``hot'' numbers. Johnny drops his partner and ogles Baby.
Dad stumbles in and gives Baby the job of talent coordinator _
Johnny's job _ for the resort's stage show. Johnny is miffed.
Conflict No. 1, with many more to come.
   Dad is suspicious about Johnny's secretive rehearsals. But Baby,
good sport that she is, persuades him to let the dancers continue,
pleading, ``Dad, you've got to give them a chance!'' There are a lot
of lines like, ``Dad, you've got to give them a chance!'' and ``All
I know is you can't give up!''
   After Dad departs, Baby brags that she has taken ballet, so
Johnny sets her up to make a fool of herself by insisting she join
the dancers. He eventually convinces her that her only purpose in
life is to defy her father and dance in the stage show, so they
sneak around at night to practice.
   Meanwhile, Penny (Constance Marie), Johnny's jealous Latin dance
partner, fumes, and Baby pretends interest in Neil (Charles
Stratton), the lifeguard her father approves of. Mandy Ingber
replaces the obnoxious sister of the movie as Baby's witless cousin,
Robin.
   Choreographer Kenny Ortega has done a good job with the dancing.
Too bad there isn't more of it. And too bad the writers and director
Tony Bill did not more effectively build the rudimentary suspense
that fuels the central cliche in the premiere _ the opening of the
big show and Baby's surprise appearance.
   By the end of the opener, everything seems to be tied up quite
nicely, but this is weekly television where concepts must be run
into the ground.
   Will Dad come to terms with Baby's new-found independence? Will
Baby and Johnny get it on before Penny gets Baby?
   Shut up and dance.

<TEXT>
   Chris Mills reacts the way many 14-year-olds
would upon being told that his parents are getting a divorce _ he is
angry.
   But Chris doesn't just get mad. He gets a lawyer.
   ``Necessary Parties,'' a witty and intelligent treatment of
children's feelings about divorce, stars Alan Arkin as the boy's
eccentric attorney. It was co-written for the screen by Arkin and
his wife, Barbara Dana, based on her book of the same name.
   The two-hour, two-part comedy-drama, premiering Nov. 5 and
concluding Nov. 12, is the season opener for PBS' critically
acclaimed anthology series for young people, ``Wonderworks.''
   The film announces its sensitivity and humor right away. In the
opening scene, Chris (Mark Paul Gosselaar) and his 6-year-old
sister, Jenny (Taylor Fry), are puttering in the kitchen, trying to
ignore the screaming and slamming by their quarreling parents (Julie
Hagerty and Geoffrey Pierson). ``So many doors,'' sighs little Jenny.
   Later, Chris watches his parents squabble during a tennis doubles
match. The car pulls away, the parents still arguing. ``I (heart)
Tennis'' says the bumper sticker.
   Chris refuses to accept his parents' decision to split, convinced
they are going through some kind of a phase. He's also worried about
the effect of the split on Jenny, who retreats into a co-identity
with her stuffed rabbit, Bunny. The child is almost too darling, but
her dialogue is really good.
   ``They made up their minds to a stupid way, and who will take
care of Bunny?'' she wonders.
   Meanwhile, Chris' friends from broken homes advise him to accept
the split. ``You can get more attention and presents than you ever
had,'' counsels Haverman (Judd Trichter). ``It's called guilt.''
   Undeterred, Chris enlists Archie Corelli, an idealist who quit
the law for the more equitable profession of auto mechanic, to press
his case in court. Archie tries to argue Chris out of a hopeless
question, but eventually he agrees to represent him.
   Meanwhile, Chris' mother struggles to cope, and his father comes
by to talk to Chris about why the family must break up. ``I'm
lost,'' he says. ``I'm 41 and I don't know who I am.''
   At the end of Part 1, Chris and Archie are bounding up the steps
of the courthouse to try to get Chris admitted as a party to the
divorce proceedings.
   In Part 2, Archie searches for a legal ground for Chris'
intervention in the case. Desperate, he sits and watches ``People's
Court'' for ideas. Jenny takes to wearing earmuffs to keep out talk
of divorce, although offers of ice cream come through loud and clear.
   Chris' mom signs him up for group counseling for children whose
parents have split up. ``And how are you dealing with your parents'
divorce?'' queries the counselor, played by Adam Arkin. ``I'm suing
them,'' Chris replies matter-of-factly.
   The movie seems to be something of an Arkin family project. Dana
plays Archie's girlfriend. Adam and Anthony Arkin have small parts.
The Arkins' other son, Matthew, is listed as production attorney.
   The final scenes in the divorce hearing tend to get a little
maudlin. There are also some superfluous scenes that make the second
half a tad draggy. For instance, eccentric Grampa Mills (Donald
Moffat) doesn't seem to serve much purpose other than acting as
Chris' legal guardian at the court proceedings.
   Despite minor flaws, this is a well-produced and doggedly earnest
endeavor with a definite point of view _ marriage is a struggle, and
divorce should be a a convenience. As Archie tells Chris, ``You've
got a point, and you're gonna make some people think.''

   The Chinese government is applying the brakes to
the market-based economy it has fostered over the last 10 years but
now finds overheated and growing too fast. Government control is
back in style.
   Inflation is 20 percent, even by conservative official estimates.
Money supply is up an astonishing 40 percent. Local governments,
ignoring austerity orders from Beijing, are throwing money at new
projects and contributing to an unsustainable industrial growth rate
of 20 percent.
   Corruption is rife, particularly among local officials taking
advantage of a two-tiered pricing system to obtain hard-to-get
materials at low state-set prices and resell them for huge gains on
the free or black markets.
   The last straw came in August, when rumors of new price increases
caused panic buying and runs on banks in several major cities.
   The economy is growing so fast, with a 45 percent jump in
investment in capital construction, that many factories are closed
three days a week because of electricity shortages. The Communist
Party Central Committee, in a plenary session in late September, put
new reform initiatives on hold. The party said the next two years
would be devoted to ``restoring control of the economic environment
and rectifying economic order.''
   Officials are assuring foreign investors and businesses, however,
that the original terms of their contracts will still be honored.
   The new policies were seen as a sign that Premier Li Peng, who
has a reputation as being cautious, has gained a larger say in
decisions. The headlong reform drive advocated by party leader Zhao
Ziyang appears discredited, although early reports that he was in
political trouble have not been substantiated.
   Over the past decade, the government has given provinces, cities
and special economic zones more authority to spend their own
revenues, borrow money abroad, conduct trade and approve development
projects.
   ``The Chinese are reacting to this (economic crisis) in the way
they know best,'' said one Western economist in Beijing, ``by
straight intervention.''
   Among the more important measures:
   _Prices. Plans to decontrol prices of steel and other basic
materials have been shelved and government price controls have been
re-established over a wide range of consumer goods. Price ceilings
will be set for grain sold on the free market and prices of other
items prized by speculators, such as fertilizers and pesticides,
will be regulated. Price inspectors will fan out around the country
to monitor market activities. Premier Li said the two-tiered pricing
system will remain ``for quite a long time.''
   _Banking-Investment. Bank loans to industrial and construction
projects outside the state plan and to non-profitable companies are
being frozen. Loans to foreign joint ventures will not be affected,
officials say.
   The government will investigate and may close many of the
estimated 500 little-regulated finance companies that have sprung up
in recent years and are a primary source of reckless lending.
Hundreds of state-run trade and investment firms also face closure
for illegal profiteering rackets.
   In one celebrated case, the government removed trading and tax
privileges from the Kang Hua Development Corp., a rapidly expanding
investment firm with links to Deng Pufang, the son of senior leader
Deng Xiaoping.
   _Construction. Construction of office buildings, auditoriums and
hotels is to be halted except for projects already approved by
planning authorities in Beijing, and a two- to three-year ban on
starting such buildings has been imposed.
   _Public Spending. The State Council, China's cabinet, increased
from 19 to 29 the number of items that public offices can purchase
only after receiving approval from above. The list includes cars,
air conditioners and video recorders.
   Public offices buying imported cars and televisions will be
slapped with a 40 percent surcharge, and 20 percent tax was put on
banquets using public funds. Government employees are forbidden to
stay in high-class hotels or to offer cigarettes and wine to guests.
   _Corruption. The government set up 27 special teams to mount a
nationwide four-month campaign on cheating, tax evasion,
profiteering and illegal payment of bonuses.
   The government has acted twice before in the past decade, most
recently in 1985, to cool off an overheated economy. In both cases
results were mixed and local officials soon reverted to ignoring
faraway Beijing.
   Despite government orders to reduce all public spending by 20
percent this year, such spending is up by 20 percent.
   Premier Li, in a speech Sept. 30, emphasized that this time
``orders must be obeyed and prohibitions observed. It is absolutely
impermissible for each to go his own way.''
   However, Chinese officials stress, and foreign economists
generally agree, that the revival of controls is temporary, and
China will proceed with its market-oriented reforms once the current
economic crisis is overcome.
   The Western economist, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted
that the government continues to push such reform ideas as selling
stocks in state-run companies and freeing enterprises from
bureaucratic interference.
   ``There's no indication that somehow they think central planning
is the way,'' he said.

   Chinese officials are taking pains to assure
foreign businesses that their contracts will be honored despite
plans to slash domestic spending and shut down hundreds of domestic
companies.
   China's handling of its latest austerity drive, the third since
it opened to foreign trade and investment in 1978, shows a new
awareness of the need to temper the effect of policy swings and
avoid frightening away foreign investors considered key to
development.
   Premier Li Peng, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, Trade Minister Zheng
Tuobin and the Bank of China all have promised in recent weeks that
China's 9,700 foreign joint ventures will be exempt from austerity
measures intended to stem a 20-percent inflation.
   ``All signed contracts for ordering goods and joint ventures will
be implemented,'' Li told about 200 visiting chief executive
officers of American companies on Oct. 17. He repeated the same
message later in the week to a Japanese banking delegation.
   The Bank of China, the chief Chinese lender to joint ventures,
said it will continue doing so.
   One of China's leading investment and trade companies, the Kang
Hua Development Corp., which has been stripped of trade rights and
ordered to divest many subsidiaries as punishment for illegal
operations, promised it will carry out all contracts already signed
with foreign companies.
   Kang Hua has signed about 4,000 import and export contracts worth
a total of $670 million since being founded 17 months ago.
   The assurances seem to be having their desired effect. Foreign
businessmen and diplomats in Beijing said they expect a drop in
Chinese import orders but not a significant reduction in joint
venture activity. Most seemed confident the impact would be minimal.
   One predicted delays in signing new contracts, however, as the
central government scrutinizes local projects more closely to weed
out any not deemed essential.
   Chinese officials say consumption and industrial growth must be
slowed and Beijing must reassert central control over the economy to
restore order to a market in which excessive demand has generated
inflation, hoarding and black marketeering.
   Foreign companies that sell factory equipment, raw materials and
luxuries to China, from cars to air conditioners, can expect a drop
in orders. Import taxes on a wide range of goods have been increased
and calls have been issued for import substitution where possible.
   However, Premier Li told the chief executive officers that China
remains interested in joint projects in energy, transportation,
communications, raw material production and high-technology.
   Foreign companies that want to manufacture consumer appliances in
China, such as televisions and refrigerators, are welcome only if
their products are for export, Li said.
   The government also has said the construction of hotels,
auditoriums and other public buildings will be sharply curtailed.
Companies found guilty of illegal transactions, such as buying and
selling scarce goods on the black market, will be closed and
companies set up by government offices will be shut down or spun off.
   Specifics, such as which projects will be halted and which
Chinese companies reorganized or closed, have been slow to emerge,
and foreign businessmen said it was too early to predict the
eventual impact. There have been no reports of casualties in the
form of canceled contract talks.
   The government also ordered slowdowns in economic growth in 1980
and 1985 when it ran short of foreign currency reserves needed for
imports. Some joint ventures were halted in midstream or canceled,
as were many import orders.
   ``At that time (the Chinese) had no cash,'' said a Western
diplomat. ``Now it's different, they have the cash. They're trying
to pause and think.''

<HEAD>Thefts Threaten Swedish Myths and History Carved in Stone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BITTE LARSSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sigurd Fafnerbane thrust his sword into
the dragon, roasted its heart over an open fire and rode away with
the gold.
   So goes a Swedish legend carved on a runestone in Eskilstuna. It
will probably survive for generations to come, if only because the
massive stone is too big to steal.
   However, archaeological experts are worried about other
runestones.
   ``More and more runestones are getting stolen,'' said Jan Peder
Lamm of the National Historical Museum. ``They are incredibly badly
watched, but then nobody could ever imagine anyone would want to
steal them.''
   The stones get their name from runes, ancient characters used in
Teutonic, Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian inscriptions, believed to
date back about 1,700 years.
   Myths, poems and the first traces of national history appear on
3,500 known runestones scattered over the Swedish countryside.
   ``The collector's value, or rather the value of curiosity, is
booming,'' said Lamm.
   Lamm said it was impossible to estimate the worth of a runestone
because there has never been a market for them. Many of the missing
stones are actually fragments, which have lain undisturbed for
centuries in pastures and churchyards.
   An entire stone can weigh nearly a ton.
   The extent of the thefts is also impossible to determine, Lamm
said, because authorities do not have the money or personnel to
conduct a detailed search.
   ``We just recently realized that they were disappearing,'' said
Lamm.
   The newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported recently that three
historically valuable fragments from about the year 1000 were
missing from a church on the island of Oland. Stones and other
artifacts have also been taken from an unguarded collection at Vreta
Cloister in southeastern Sweden.
   ``Every runstone is registered and well-documented,'' Lamm said.
``So from a scientific point of view, it is no catastrophe if they
are stolen. We have all the information down on computers.''
   He added, however, that the situation is still serious.
   Trading in runestones is illegal.
   ``They are public property, and this year we further tightened
the laws. But I believe many people break the law without knowing,''
by picking up fragments, Lamm said.
   Runestones are still turning up. In the latest find in September,
a mammoth stone uncovered in a churchyard on the Baltic island of
Gotland recorded the westward travel of the Vikings.
   The elaborately carved inscription says: ``Vatar and Hailgair
erected the stone after Helge, their father. He went westwards with
the Vikings.''
   The mushroom-shaped 1,500-pound stone depicts a Christian cross
and mythological symbols, which indicate that it was carved during
the transition to Christianity around 1,000 years ago.
   Rune writers were Sweden's first artists to sign their works and
the first national poets. One stone says:
   ``He stood like a man
   ``In the stem of the ship.
   ``He lies in the west.''
   The oldest stones often depict carved scenes from mythology, with
ships in battle and Norse gods in combat with dragons.
   On a typical stone, a caption is inscribed on the back of the
giant mythical Midgard snake, whose body twists around the edge of
the stone's flattened surface. Legend says that Judgment Day will
come when the god Thor strikes the snake dead with his hammer.
   Helmer Gustavson of the Central Board of National Antiquities
said runes also were carved on wood, jewelry or weapons.
   Sometimes they only identified the owner: ``Tova owns me.''
Others invoked supernatural power on a spear or a knife.
   Experts disagree over the origin of the letters, but ancient
legends say the runic characters were a gift of the god Odin, the
chief Nordic deity.
   Runestones kept oral legends from disappearing and opened a world
of ancient literature.
   A ninth-century stone called Rokstenen is the most famous
literary find. On it, a father tells of a son slain in battle. He
illustrates the story with heroic tales and songs.
   Carvings line the foreign routes of the long spring voyages, when
swift ships carried Vikings over the known and unknown world.
   Viking graffiti decorate a marble lion that once guarded the
Greek port of Piraeus and a church wall in Constantinople, now
Istanbul in Turkey, said Gustavson of the antiquities board.
   ``With Christianity, the voyages become scarcer and Latin slowly
overtook the runic alphabet.''
   Runes are still taught in Swedish schools.
   Gustavson said he once saw a modern variant on a rock by a
Stockholm lake. A couple in the 1950s carved: ``Ulla and Per tented
here.''

<HEAD>Two Shows Look at a Small Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN LINNEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Starkly different productions of music
and dance by two Lisbon theater groups provide intriguing glimpses
into how the Portuguese see themselves nearly 15 years after the
return of democracy to Western Europe's poorest nation.
   The shows, one by a progressive theater cooperative and the other
by a more traditional music hall troupe, also illustrate how the
country's recent history still weighs heavily on the public
consciousness.
   The 48-year dictatorship established by Antonio de Salazar in
1926 and brought down by leftist military officers in April 1974 is
pivotal in both ``O Baile'' (``The Dance'') and ``A Prova dos
Novos'' (``The Test of the Newcomers'').
   ``O Baile,'' performed at a former nightclub called the Ritz by
the A Barraca (The Barracks) cooperative, was inspired by the French
film ``Le Bal'' (``The Dance''), directed by Ettore Scola.
   Helder Costa, director, author and leader of the cooperative,
said the Ritz production uses a dance hall setting to portray
Portugal's ``memory of itself confronted by outside influences.''
   ``A Prova dos Novos'' takes place at the Variedades Theater in
the downtown Parque Mayer where Lisboetas have been going for years
to eat grilled sardines and attend burlesque and vaudeville shows.
   The writers and many of the actors are children of music hall
veterans, an art that has kept three theaters going in the park
since the 1920s.
   In ``O Baile,'' the decline of Salazar's dictatorship is
portrayed as a carnival ball attended by dancers wearing huge paper
mache masks representing the traditional pillars of society _ the
Roman Catholic Church, the landowners, the police and the secret
service.
   In a splashy number in the Variedades show, actor Carlos Cunha
does a double takeoff on Portugal's leading young designer, Ana
Salazar, and long-time ruler Salazar as ``Manna Salazar, the
dictator of fashion,'' who is obsessed by boots.
   Salazar, who died in 1968 but whose regime carried over to 1974,
was popularly known as ``Boots.''
   The 14 actors in ``O Baile'' never utter a word, although they go
through numerous changes of costume designed to orient the audience
to the time in which their performance takes place: the Second World
War when neutral Lisbon was the center of international intrigue;
the '30s when the fascist Portuguese Legion tried to bully civilians
into submission; the late '60s when thousands of Portuguese youths
were drafted into colonial African wars.
   A beauty contest in the '50s judged by a ``fado'' singer dressed
in black is a biting satire on the music identified with Lisbon and
made famous outside Portugal by Amalia Rodrigues. The songs, often
about lost love, are accompanied by guitars or mandolins.
   ``Salazar turned fado into an official support for his regime,''
Costa said in an interview. ``People forgot fado can also be
lilting, not only sad. He almost succeeded in convincing the
Portuguese we were cut out to be morose, melancholy and ultimately
passive.''
   Soccer, Portugal's consuming national passion, is also central in
both productions.
   In ``A Prova dos Novos,'' contestants in a game show dressed to
represent the four major soccer clubs _ Benfica, Sporting, Os
Belenenses and Porto _ offer a hilarious and biting look at how
blatant game-fixing and cash deals have sullied the sport that keeps
much of the population of 10 million mesmerized two nights a week.
   In ``O Baile,'' dance hall patrons gather around to watch a
flickering black and white image of Mozambican-Portuguese soccer
great Eusebio on the field, in a scene marking the fateful
introduction of television into the country in the late '50s.
   With the exception of the music halls, Portuguese theater has
never been terribly robust. It suffers from a lack of funding and
overwhelming competition from television.
   But critic Carlos Porto calls the growing production of works
about Porutugal by Portuguse writers ``one of the most important
developments on our changing theatrical horizon.''
   Although given generally favorable reviews, ``A Prova dos
Novos,'' like the other music hall presentations in the Parque
Mayer, generally attracts a provincial audience.
   ``Most people who imagine themselves intellectuals or
professionals wouldn't set foot in a musical revue in a place like
this,'' said Gabriela Alvarez, a Lisbon video producer. ``Too bad,
because they're missing something.''
   The Ritz doesn't advertise its show, but Costa said word-of-mouth
publicity and rave reviews for the year-old ``O Baile'' have
resulted in weekend capacity houses of 200, including President
Mario Soares.

<TEXT>
   Daniel Manion has a job he never sought after
people said nasty things about him he never imagined he'd hear.
   Manion was the focus of a battle over President Reagan's judicial
appointments two years ago when he was named to the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   To his critics, including prominent Democrats and civil
libertarians, he was an untalented lawyer nominated only because of
right-wing views.
   Republicans saw the former state legislator from South Bend,
Ind., as an honorable public servant under fire only because
liberals wanted to block Reagan appointees.
   ``It became a cause celebre for both sides,'' Manion, 46, said of
the fight for his ratification.
   ``The people who ... knew me were defending me ... for the most
part,'' he said in a recent interview. ``The people who knew me
(only) by reputation, i.e. my conservative politics, were pretty
much going after me.''
   The 7th Circuit is based in Chicago and covers Illinois, Indiana
and Wisconsin.
   In his 1986 confirmation hearings, critics blasted Manion for his
politics and more, pointing out grammatical errors in briefs from
his private law practice in South Bend. They also questioned his
intelligence.
   Manion said his briefs were written in a hurry and typed quickly
by someone else, noting that in a small practice, ``your client
can't afford to have three people ... edit something.'' He said he
did well in the cases.
   Questions about his intelligence also have failed to stick,
Manion said.
   ``If you were to take a cross-section of all the judges in the
country ... you're going to see some really exceptional people,'' he
said. ``Then, you're going to see a lot of people who are, you know,
intelligent, hard-working. ... They'd be like me, I guess.''
   Manion shrugs off the criticisms as politics.
   ``I held public office, I was a state senator,'' he said. ``I
understand politics. I understand motivations.''
   But the ordeal was difficult for his family.
   ``I think that as the toughest part,'' he said. ``In the opposite
direction, though, many local people and state people _ even
political adversaries _ said very nice things that they probably
wouldn't have said if they didn't see this as being very negative. I
think that was gratifying.''
   Some lawyers who have appeared before him in 7th Circuit cases
give him adequate to high marks for his courtroom demeanor.
   ``It was clear he was on top of the case,'' said Samuel Fifer, a
Chicago lawyer who watched a junior associate argue a copyright
infringement case before Manion. ``He has been behaving and
performing like any other judge on that court.''
   But another Chicago lawyer, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified, criticized Manion for taking more than a year to issue
an opinion on a case.
   ``He's just incredibly slow,'' the lawyer said. ``I think he's
responding to all the criticism of his intellectual capacity and
writing ability.''
   It was fair to call him slow at first, Manion said, noting he was
working in cramped, temporary offices in South Bend, getting used to
a new routine and breaking in new clerks. Now, he said, he is
keeping pace with other judges.
   At the 1986 confirmation hearings, critics brought up Manion's
father, who was a founder of the ultraconservative John Birch
Society. In the 1970s, he had appeared on talk shows with his
father, often questioning the authority of the Supreme Court on
social issues.
   Though he acknowledges that he is conservative, Manion said
precedent, not ideology, dictates his decisions in court.
   ``You don't have any choice,'' he said. ``I thought that was
clear from the start.''
   Manion's appointment came at a time when many Democrats,
including Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, were questioning
qualifications of judges appointed by Reagan.
   ``The quality of the nominees that President Reagan sent up under
(former) Attorney General Ed Meese was notably less than under the
Carter administration,'' said Pamela Huey, a Simon spokeswoman.
   The quality of nominees in the past year seems to have improved,
she said, adding that the debate over Manion may have made the
Justice Department take more care in finding judges.
   During the Manion debate, strong support came from fellow Hoosier
and law school acquaintance Sen. Dan Quayle, now the running mate of
Republican presidential nominee George Bush. Bush cast a
tie-breaking vote for Manion in the Senate.
   The American Bar Association rated Manion ``qualified,'' but the
rating was mixed. ABA spokesman Richard Collins said the association
does not follow-up formally once judges are seated.
   Forty law-school deans also signed a letter opposing Manion's
confirmation.
   It was tough criticism for the soft-spoken Indiana University law
school graduate, former deputy state attorney general, one-term
state senator, and the first Vietnam veteran nominated to a federal
appeals court.
   But that is largely past.
   A sampling of his written opinions does not reflect sharp biases.
   In one opinion, Manion upheld a $32,837 judgment against a
strip-mining company deemed delinquent in paying fees for land
reclamation.
   In another case, Manion overturned a lower court ruling in favor
of a police department accused of using excessive force on a woman.
   The opinions appear free of grammar and spelling errors, which
Manion attributes to the resources of his office.
   ``Now, I have two other people proofread everything,'' he said.
   Manion, who overcame a bout with multiple sclerosis that
developed in 1979, won a local canoeing and running biathlon this
summer, has a new home in South Bend and is a new father.
   He takes a train the nearly 100 miles to Chicago for courtroom
work and meetings about once every 10 days. He said he has no
visions of moving up the Supreme Court.
   ``In fact,'' he said, ``I wouldn't have taken this job if I had
to move to Chicago.''

<HEAD>Sindlinger Says Recession On Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When recession forecasts were blowing around like
fall leaves in late October 1987, Albert Sindlinger said he was
certain there wouldn't be one. Now he sees one coming.
   Again, his view is at odds with the consensus, which has the
economy expanding weakly through most of the year, with any
recession occurring only at the very tail end or in 1990.
   What makes Sindlinger so sure of himself? Because, he says, you
and other people all around the country tell him. ``It's
micro-economics,'' he explains. ``We determine the economic
condition of every household we call.''
   Those calls total between 105 and 115 a day, eight to 15 minutes
each, seven days a week from Media, Pa. It's been that way for 34
years, with the calls to each state in proportion to its percent of
the total population.
   In effect, says Sindlinger, ``I don't make the forecast, the
people do.'' Unlike consumer confidence polls, Sindlinger & Co.
personnel don't seek views on the national economy. Instead, they
seek data on household money supply.
   That data is culled from answers to questions in four areas:
Current income compared with six months earlier; expected income
over the next six months; expected job security, and expected local
business conditions.
   The answers provide the economic and market research firm with a
measure of what it calls household liquidity. When liquidity
improves, better times usually follow. When it falls, watch out.
   Since Oct. 10, says Al Sindlinger, the liquidity fall has been
very sharp.
   A tour through the statistics with Sindlinger shows why.
   Last week there were 88.234 million telephone households _ 98.6
percent of all households _ in the 48 contiguous states. In these
households were 151.823 million household heads, which means
multiple heads in many homes.
   Sindlinger divides these households into three categories:
   Households that own stock in a public or private company or in a
mutual fund; intermediate households, that don't own stocks but do
own bonds and have savings; and distressed households, with no
savings or other liquid assets.
   The stockholder households accounted for 24 percent of the total
households. The intermediates made up 57.4 percent, the distressed
households 18.6 percent.
   During the past year, or ever since the big market crash of Oct.
19, 1987, the intermediate category was the sturdy underpinning of
the American economy, says Sindlinger. They were liquid enough to go
on buying.
   Now, there's a big question regarding that ability. Here's why:
   On Aug. 8, the day before the Federal Reserve raised the discount
rate _ ``to fight inflation that wasn't there,'' says Sindlinger _
69 percent of all heads of households had household liquidity.
   That is, they were able to show gains in income over the prior
six months and expected that situation to continue during the next
six months.
   But in the week of Oct. 27, Sindlinger was able to find only 56.2
percent with liquidity. The loss, he said, resulted from adjustable
rate loans whose costs have risen. True, he said, these households
have assets that now might earn higher interest, but these assets
are small in comparison to a mortgage.
   Among stockholder families, only 3 percent, currently have any
plans to buy more stock, and seven of 10 current stockholders expect
the value of what they have to fall during the next six months.
   Meanwhile, the intermediate group, made up of those with savings,
bonds and other liquid assets, has swelled. This is the group,
Sindlinger points out, that was liquid enough to keep the country
out of recession since last year.
   But while the intermediate category has grown (absorbing some
ex-stockholders), its liquidity has fallen. A year ago, many of
those in the intermediate category were flush, having sold out of
the stock market at the top. Those falling down into the
intermediate category now are considerably less well off. Many are
illiquid.
   What, then, keeps stocks up? Foreign buying, mainly Japanese,
says the octogenarian Sindlinger. ``It certainly isn't the American
public,'' he snaps.
   Instead, the American public seems to be preparing for a
recession. Thanks to the Fed, says, Sindlinger, Americans are
increasingly illiquid. ``That's what they tell me,'' he says.

<HEAD>Economic Crisis in Peru Raises Danger of Military Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alan Garcia, Peru's youthful president, was
viewed as Latin America's brightest political star after taking
office three years ago, but today his nation is mired in its worst
economic crisis of the century.
   Garcia's reputation is in tatters, and the country's fragile
democracy appears increasingly vulnerable to a military coup.
   Since Garcia imposed the harshest austerity program in Peru's
history in early September, some critics have gone so far as to
demand his resignation, and he reportedly has considered stepping
down. More ominously, many public figures are warning of the growing
danger of a military takeover.
   Cesar Hilderbrandt, editor of the independent news magazine Si,
wrote in a recently published open letter to Garcia: ``You know,
just as other officials of your government do, that a coup d'etat is
inevitable if the political and economic climate of today continues
to devastate the country,''
   Peru's armed forces seized power in 1968 and ruled until 1980.
They returned to the barracks under heavy public accusations that
their leftist policies brought on economic mismanagement.
   The 39-year-old Garcia's approval rating among Peru's 21 million
people has plunged from an incredible 96 percent during his first
months in office to 16 percent in late October, according to the
respected polling firm Apoyo.
   When he took over, the 6-foot-3 Garcia, leader of the populist
Aprista Party, was called ``the president of hope'' by his
followers, most of them impoverished mountain peasants or
inhabitants of Lima's sprawling shantytowns.
   Nowadays he is accused of being a demagogue, of implementing
impetuous, irresponsible policies that have brought economic ruin to
the nation, and of failing to curtail the Shining Path movement,
whose eight-year guerrilla war has claimed more than 12,000 lives.
   Mario Vargas Llosa, the renowned novelist who is expected to be
the presidential candidate of a center-right coalition in the 1990
election, recently described Garcia as ``the charismatic young man
responsible for Peru's most incompetent and ruinous government of
the century.''
   What has Peruvians most upset is the country's unprecedented
runaway inflation, provoked, economists agree, by the government's
uncontrolled spending, which has spawned a huge fiscal deficit
equivalent to 16 percent of the gross domestic product.
   Consumer prices soared by 114 percent in September, as much in
one month as all of last year. Inflation is expected to exceed 1,000
percent by year end.
   Having eaten up the country's hard currency reserves to finance a
consumer-hinged economic recovery program and having cut itself off
from fresh foreign loans, the government is close to bankruptcy. It
has had to resort to selling the Central Bank's gold bullion to pay
import bills, but now that is gone.
   Finance Minister Abel Salinas said recently the economy would
shrink by at least 6 percent this year after growing 8.5 percent in
1986 and 7.0 percent in 1987.
   The harsh austerity measures, which included increases in food
prices of more than 200 percent and a devaluation of nearly 90
percent, brought economic activity to a halt.
   Only four new cars were sold in the country in September because
of tax increases that doubled car prices, with the least expensive
Volkswagen model now costing $26,000. Beer sales were down 90
percent from August.
   From early September until mid October, Garcia did not leave the
inner confines of the Government Palace for 34 straight days, except
on one occasion to watch the changing of the guards from the front
entrance. That single, fleeting appearance was interpreted by
commentators as a gesture to dispel rumors he was no longer in
charge of the government.
   Garcia was reported to have tried to present his resignation to
his Cabinet before the unpopular austerity package was imposed and
to have offered the job to Luis Alberto Sanchez, his 88-year-old,
blind vice president. Sanchez said later that he told Garcia, ``I
was elected vice president to collaborate with you, not to take your
place.''
   Political analysts say Garcia's recent behavior has given the
impression of a dangerous power vacuum that feeds the fears of a
military takeover.
   ``Even the least informed citizen knows, or senses, that there
cannot be a power vacuum in politics. He also knows that in Peru
power vacuums are always filled by the military,'' Manuel
d'Ornellas, editor of the opposition newspaper Expreso, wrote in a
recent column.
   A senior government official told The Associated Press that the
military high command did, in fact, meet to consider overthrowing
Garcia during his self-imposed confinement to the palace.
   ``The president was passing through a period of depression that
worried the military,'' the official said, speaking on condition he
not be identified.
   Having suffered in the past under long spells of military rule,
Peru's political leaders have been outspoken in demanding that the
armed forces not be provoked into seizing power again.
   ``Nothing would be more tragic for Peru than a military coup,''
writer Vargas Llosa said. ``Peru's isolation from the international
community would be aggravated even further.''

<HEAD>Tourists Fuel Debate Over Pushing Roads Through Alaska Wilds</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOK, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Taylor Highway, a rib-jarring gravel
washboard that snakes through mining hills northeast of this
interior Alaska village, doesn't rate much mention in the tourist
brochures.
   But the Taylor is Larry Champagne's specialty. He drives a tow
truck and, as they say in the trade, business is picking up. He sat
the other day in his Chevron station and pointed out the highway's
latest victim: a van with a crushed roof and shattered windows.
   ``He was passing a motor home on a curve, got over too far, and
t-h-p-p-t, into the river,'' he said. Champagne was happy to haul
the van and its uninjured driver back to Tok, for $700.
   A 1984 legislative study found that 60 percent of Alaska highways
were in fair to poor condition. But the potholes and frost heaves
don't slow the flow of vacationers. Growing herds of tourists not
only keep Champagne smiling but also help fuel debate over this
frontier state's transportation future.
   More roads! say business leaders who see a young and developing
state with little access to remote villages and mineral deposits.
   Stop the bulldozers! cry environmentalists who see a pristine
land needing protection from the forces that paved over the lower 48
states.
   The arguments likely will continue as long as there are places
people cannot drive to, and much of Alaska fits that category. The
state's 11,600 miles of roads are concentrated in the southeastern
quarter, leaving vast areas untracked.
   One-fourth of Alaska's half-million residents live unconnected by
road to the outside world. Of 151 incorporated communities, 133 are
unconnected, including the state capital of Juneau.
   Given the mountains and permanently frozen ground that cover much
of Alaska, it's a wonder roads were ever built.
   Turn-of-the-century gold rushes spurred the first major
construction. In World War II, concerns about a Japanese invasion
prompted another building frenzy; the 1,520-mile Alaska Highway,
Alaska's first overland link to the lower 48, was finished in just
nine months.
   Since statehood in 1959, expansion has continued steadily. The
latest road, completed this summer in northwestern Alaska, is a
54-mile link from the coast to a mineral deposit known as Red Dog.
   ``I try not to think about that,'' said Susan Alexander, state
representative for the Wilderness Society, which unsuccessfully
fought the road's route through Cape Krusenstern National Monument.
   She said wilderness is easily destroyed by roads and resulting
development and pollution. She cited the 416-mile Dalton Highway,
built in 1974 to link Fairbanks and the Prudhoe Bay oil fields.
Although only the highway's southern half is open to the public, lax
enforcement lets many drivers slip through to the north, and
Alexander worries about the effect on wildlife.
   ``Increased access means increased poaching, and there definitely
has been poaching along the road. The road lets in people, hunters,
who wouldn't have been there otherwise,'' she said.
   Letting more people into Alaska is what economic boosters have
had in mind for years. Wherever roads have gone, tourism has
followed. U.S. Customs officials say 38,150 vehicles _ about 70
percent of them motor homes and campers _ entered the state on the
Alaska Highway last year.
   Roads can cut shipping costs to villages and make remote mining
more competitive, say the boosters, who over the years have proposed
dozens of roads to fill blank spaces on the map.
   In 1977, travel guides called the 152-mile Elliott Highway near
Fairbanks the ``Road to Nome,'' even though it dead-ended, and still
does, 500 miles short of the Bering Sea town.
   In 1986, the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce suggested a
road that would head 200 miles southwest from Denali National Park
to McGrath, then swing north another 200 miles to the Yukon River.
   In southeastern Alaska, plans surface occasionally to connect
Juneau to highways that now stop in Haines and Skagway.
   But such projects, each estimated to cost hundreds of millions of
dollars, are distant dreams for state officials who can barely raise
the $52 million needed each year to maintain existing roads.
   Alaska's oil-dependent government has grown cautious since the
oil boom busted, and the state Department of Transportation plans no
major highway expansion. It would cost $600 million just to bring
Alaska's rural highways up to standards, said Ron Lind, the agency's
planning and budget director.
   Patterns of land use and ownership also discourage road-building.
National parks, preserves and monuments now cover 50 million of
Alaska's 375 million acres. Natives, protective of open space needed
for subsistence hunting and fishing, own 44 million acres.
   But things could change quickly in Alaska's boom-bust economy. As
publisher Robert Henning wrote in an Alaska Geographic book called
``Adventure Roads North'':
   ``Strong anti-roads sentiments of environmentalist groups have
slowed Alaskan road construction, but in the history of the North,
there has ever been the cry for `more roads, more trails,' and it is
inevitable that the road building will continue. ... Like it or not,
it seems to be the American way.''
   Wherever and whenever roads are built, the likes of Larry
Champagne will be there to pick up the pieces. Back at the Chevron
station, Champagne was smiling again; a Winnebago driver was in for
the second time that day with a flat tire.
   Champagne quickly fixed the tire and proceeded to the cash
register. ``That'll be $10,'' he said. ``You have a nice day.''

<HEAD>Scientists Try to Explain Mysteries of Chinese Qi Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist in a white lab coat scraped bits of
cancer tissue from a white mouse into two sterilized glass dishes.
   Two young men in slightly scruffy street clothes sat on stools in
front of the dishes. Each extended his right hand over a dish,
closed his eyes and concentrated.
   ``They are giving off qi,'' whispered the scientist, immunologist
Gu Ligang.
   The experiment, a hybrintific method and seeming
magic, is part of a growing effort among Chinese scied of modern scientists
to
verify and analyze what many Chinese believe to be a special human
energy called qi.
   The belief in Qi is central to traditional Chinese medicine but
it is viewed skeptically by Western scientists.
   In this case, the two men giving off qi were attempting to kill
the cancerous cells in the dishes.
   Popular interest in qi and 2,000-year-old exercises to develop
it, called qigong, is sweeping China after the method had been
suppressed for decades as superstition. An estimated 50 million
adults practice qigong exercises, while hospitals, schools and
scholarly institutes across China are researching qi.
   ``Qigong is a national cultural treasure and an integral part of
Chinese traditional medicine'sble channels, like veins, and that illness
is a result
of blockages in its flow. Traditional healing techniques, from
herbal medicines to acupuncture to qigong, are efforts to restore
the distribution of qi.
   Gu Ligang's experiment with the cancerous cells, like hundreds
being done nationwide, seeks to gather physical evidence of whether
some people, known as qigong masters, can project their qi like a
beam of energy to manipulate matter and cure illness.
   Gu, one of 30 qigong researchers at the Beijing College of
Traditional Chinese Medicine, said some cancerous cells were killed
in one sample in his experiment, but not enough to prove anything.
   Qigong masters, however, say their work proves the mysterious
force exists.
   Hu Yulan, 59, said she has cured serious heart and neurological
illnesses by directing her qi at patients.
   Another master, Wan Sujian, said a 49-year-old peasant woman came
to him after a surgeon told her a large tumor in her brain was
inoperable and that she would die in two months.
   Wan said the woman could barely walk because of the tumor's
pressure on portions of the brain that control movement.
   But after 10 treatments, he said, the woman was walking freely.
   ``The tumor has shrunk,'' Wan claimed. He predicted complete
recovery.
   Thousands of other qigong masters, who operate clinics without
licensing or regulation, make similar claims. Some say they can heal
bone fractures and diagnose ailments with X-ray vision _ even when
the patient is absent. Volumes of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous
cures have been published.
   ``There are many blank areas in science,'' said Liu Yaning, a
biophysicist at the air force's Xidiaoyutai Hospital in Beijing.
``In China, many scientists believe the qigong masters will lead a
revolution in science.''
   But Western medicine, which in the past decade has found chemical
explanations for acupuncture's ability to deaden pain, balks at the
concept of qi.
   ``I haven't been convinced by any experiment that this energy
exists or that it can be controlled,'' said Dr. David Eisenberg, an
instructor at the Harvard Medical School who attended the qigong
conference.
   However, Eisenberg, who studied traditional medicine in China in
1979 and 1980 and wrote a book about qigong, said he has seen
startling demonstrations of qigong masters' skills and cannot simply
dismiss them as fakes.
   ``There are phenomenon in every culture that suggests there may
be the ability of humans to sense and-or manipulate their own
biological fields, for lack of a better word,'' he said. ``I'm
troubled but not convinced.''
   Chinese scientists also are troubled. Many who are testing qigong
masters said they believe some form of special human energy exists,
but can't define it.
   Books on qigong describe it variously as akin to radar, infrared
light, magnetism, subsonic sound waves or all of those.
   ``I think qi is a big bag,'' Liu said. ``There are a lot of
things in it _ not just one kind of energy or matter.''
   He added that his experiments, showing that natural luminescence
given off by qigong masters' bodies is higher than that given off by
other people, have convinced him qi exists.
   ``There is much clinical evidence to see the effect of qigong on
many different diseases,'' said Dr. Lu Yongcai, a pathologist at the
Beijing College of Traditional Medicine's Qigong Institute. ``We
want to know the mechanisms. That qi is present is no problem.''
   ``Qi definitely can cause biological reactions. That's a fact,''
said Zhou Yang, the institute's chief immunologist.
   He said his experiments have shown that qi can promote the
proliferation of disease-fighting T-cells in laboratory mice and
stimulate the development of the thymus, an important gland in the
immune system.
   Chinese scientists at the qigong conference said their work
showed qigong masters can do such things as kill or inhibit leukemia
cells in mice, promote healing of strained muscles and broken bones
in rabbits and sharpen intelligence.
   Eisenberg contended that most of the studies suffered from poor
design or lacked control groups and other standard precautions
against bias.
   ``There is at least as much likelihood that this is a cultural,
societal wish fulfillment,'' he said. ``Qi is part of the culture.
... They are wed to it, they want to prove it.''
   But Dr. Gabriel Stux, who runs an acupuncture clinic in
Duesseldorf in West Germany, noted that Western medicine also relies
on techniques not fully understood.
   ``Many drugs, you don't know how they work. But you do a lot of
pragmatic things,'' he said.

<HEAD>Venezuelans Head into Presidential Election as Economy Falters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAROLD OLMOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuelans, whose fortunes rise and
fall with the price of oil, are heading into a presidential election
next month at a time when their once-robust economy is in a serious
slump.
   The seventh-month campaign for the Dec. 4 balloting has been rich
in promises by candidates who have yet to explain how they would pay
for their programs if elected.
   More than 9 million people, roughly half the population of the
country, are eligible to vote to elect their seventh president since
the nation's last dictator, Gen. Marcos Perez Jimenez, was
overthrown in 1958.
   The main candidates are former President Carlos Andres Perez, 66,
of the social democratic Accion Democratica (AD) party and Eduardo
Fernandez, 48, of the Social Christian Party, better known as COPEI,
the acronym formed by its name in Spanish.
   Recent polls give a lead of 14 points to Perez, who served as
president in 1973-78, when Venezuela was awash in oil dollars.
   Both candidates have made campaign promises ranging from
modernizing the nation's industries and placing computers in every
school to new hospital beds and free milk for school children.
   Neither has detailed where they will get money to pay for it all.
   But with the nation's once-overflowing treasury now nearly empty,
whoever wins is likely to find it difficult to fulfill campaign
pledges.
   Despite a relative success in agriculture, Venezuela's economy
has been hard-hit by persistently low prices of oil, the nation's
major source of export revenue. Oil has plunged from a high of $30 a
barrel in the 1970s to its current level of around $13.
   Current prices on world markets continue to slump, a sharp
contrast to the market boom during Perez' first term, when he
nationalized the oil industry. The slide in oil prices this year
alone may cost the nation as much as $3 billion in revenue, nearly a
third of the $10.7 billion originally expected.
   Coupled with a foreign debt of $35 billion, Latin America's
fourth largest after Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, a continuation of
this trend may pose a heavy political and social burden to the
government to be installed in February.
   According to official statistics, real income for the average
Venezuelan family has shrunk by 20 percent since 1982, when oil
prices began to fall.
   While less than 1.5 percent of the population enjoys 35 percent
of the nation's income, 40 percent do not earn enough to cover their
basic nutritional needs, according to a Venezuelan Central
University report.
   Perez and Fernandez agree that drastic changes must be
implemented to reverse this trend. But while Perez proposes to
expand public sector expenditures as a means to boost the economy,
Fernandez says he would rely more on the private sector.
   Rather than emphasizing their differences, both Perez and
Fenandez have devoted most of their efforts trying to discredit each
other.
   Intense hostility kicked off the early part of the campaign when
both candidates accused each other of receiving campaign money from
drug traffickers.
   The exchange of accusations ceased only when the Supreme
Electoral Council, which supervises the campaign, called on Perez
and Fernandez to avoid injurious attacks.
   AD and COPEI have traditionally alternated in power, with AD
winning over COPEI four out of six times in the 30 years of civilian
rule.
   Both parties together totalled 90 percent of the vote in the 1983
elections, won by the AD's Jaime Lusinchi, now the incumbent
president.
   Twenty-one other candidates also are in the running, covering a
wide range of the political and social spectrum.
   One is a witch doctor, Romulo Abreu Duarte, who professes a
fervent belief in the legendary goddess Maria Lionza, descended, her
devotees say, from a Spanish conquistador and an Indian princess.
   Others include the former pro-Castro guerrilla leader Teodoro
Petkoff of the leftist Movement toward Socialism, and Ismenia
Villalba of the centrist Democratic Revolutionary Union.
   Aware of the overwhelming strength of AD and Copei, the minor
parties are aiming instead to win some of the 229 congressional
seats at stake.
   Both Villalba, the first woman to ever run for president in
Venezuela, and Petkoff expect to improve their parties'
congressional strength, now respectively 11 and 9 seats.
   The tiny Venezuelan Communist Party is running in a coalition led
by Edmundo Chirinos, former rector of Venezuelan Central University.
   AD and COPEI stand to lose considerable legislative power if the
minor parties make gains in the congressional balloting, analysts
say.

<TEXT>
   Has the stock market, that legendary cauldron of
excess and greed, suddenly been transformed into a force for
discipline and restraint in the U.S. economy?
   What brings up this question is the recent outbreak of reluctance
among the investing public to endorse and join in the buyout wave
sweeping through many areas of corporate America.
   The merits and demerits of takeovers and leveraged buyouts, or
LBOs, can be debated endlessly. As new deals of unprecedented size
have surfaced in the past few weeks, however, more and more analysts
warned that a long-standing trend was turning into a dangerous mania.
   At some point, even some early proponents of LBOs declared, the
load of debt created to replace the stock taken out of public hands
in these deals threatens to turn into an onerous burden.
   The situation seemed to come to a head on Thursday, when ``buyout
fever'' gave way to what looked more like ``buyout phobia'' in the
stock market.
   Investors, including money managers at some large institutions,
began selling instead of buying stocks that were known or rumored to
be candidates for takeovers, buyouts, or restructurings.
   The fear did not originate in the stock market. Owners of
corporate bonds had been selling for several days, restive about the
prospect of large new increases in business debt.
   Nevertheless, the change of attitude was striking. ``For the
first time people are seeing how the whole process works,'' said
Hugh Johnson at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   The typical takeover deal, Johnson observed, ``requires a
financing, it requires a SUCCESSFUL financing, and sometimes a
successful financing is hard to do.''
   Should they continue to vote with their pocketbooks against
takeovers, investors could cause a good deal of trouble for the
securities business.
   Less takeover activity might well mean decreased trading volume,
reduced revenues for already depressed investment firms, and lower
stock prices for all concerned, at least in the short run.
   But at the same time, some observers argue, anti-takeover
sentiment in the market might help defuse a potentially explosive
problem.
   As Anthony Tabell at Delafield, Harvey, Tabell Inc., put it:
``The current market, driven as it is by takeovers, raises at least
a few echoes of the banking practices of the 1920s.''
   Looking at one proposed deal predicated on about $10 billion of
borrowed money, Tabell said, ``it is hard to see this practice as
anything other than the extension of stock market credit, a process
which, when indulged in excessively in the past, has been known to
lead to grief.''
   The concept of securities markets acting as a kind of
``vigilante'' force to police the economy has been gaining increased
currency in recent years.
   First it was the bond market. Burned by inflation in the 1970s
and early 1980s, bond traders became militant anti-inflationists,
pushing interest rates higher each time they saw the slightest
stirring of an increase in inflationary pressures.
   In some people's eyes, the stock market crash of 1987 was a
vigilante action, too _ a move to forestall international trade and
credit policies that investors collectively saw as frightening.
   In fact, those who subscribe to this view say, the crash probably
prevented a recession, by forcing changes in policies and attitudes,
rather than foreshadowing or causing an economic slump.
   Economic growth continues, with relatively low inflation. Whether
you like the idea of financial vigilantes operating in the markets
or not, they appear to be pretty good at getting things their way.

   Thousands of bones are heaped on the
tables. Skulls of all sizes stare from the shelves. Soon thigh bones
will be connected to hip bones, and neck bones to head bones, at the
H.T. Lensgraf Co.
   ``We can make your mother-in-law if you want,'' said Tom
Shelledy, general manager of Lensgraf, one of the few companies in
the world that creates hand-made replicas of entire skeletons and
individual bones.
   The finished products, made of urethane plastic, are sold to
clinics, medical schools, physical therapists, hospitals, medical
libraries and doctors nationwide and in 20 other countries.
   ``You mention Lensgraf products and just about any doctor knows
who you're talking about,'' Shelledy said.
   Having one of the world's leading makers of bone copies in this
southeastern Iowa village doesn't seem strange to the 897 residents.
Many of them don't even blink when Shelledy takes his pet baboon,
Babelle, for a stroll.
   From a cage in the middle of the Lensgraf factory, Babelle
watches two dozen employees work in somewhat of an assembly line
fashion.
   Parts _ a total of 180, not including small hardware such as
screws and wire for assembly _ are formed in molds that were made
from actual bones.
   ``Most of the bones have come out of India or Europe,'' Shelledy
said. ``A real, complete skeleton will run you a couple of thousand
dollars.''
   After the plastic parts harden, they are taken to another part of
the factory, where the excess bits called ``flesh'' are removed.
   The urethane plastic skeletons, each selling for $399, are
assembled at five separate stations.
   ``It takes a day to make a full skeletal replica,'' Shelledy
said. ``We can put out 14 a day.''
   The replicas are complete with arteries, discs and nerves, and
Lensgraf also manufactures dog heart replicas for veterinarians.
   For fun, Lensgraf makes such trinkets as 5-inch-long spinal cord
key chains, or key rings attached to miniature foot and hand
structures.
   Shelledy says it's not spooky being around bones and skulls all
day.
   ``I wouldn't say it's spooky ... it's quite different,'' he said.
``Your mind comes up with a lot of questions _ who they were, what
they were like. ... To know these structures once had feelings _
happy and sad _ and now they're all gone.''

   In his search for an escape from the frustration of
playing monarch-in-waiting, Prince Charles is carving out a niche as
an improbable but often effective ``Voice of the People.''
   His sorties into issues like ocean pollution, unemployment and
inner city decay bring him about as close to political controversy
as the strictly neutral British monarchy can go. By stretching the
bars of his gilded cage, this child of privilege faces the irony of
becoming a darling of the left, monarchy's traditional foe.
   Charles Philip Arthur George turns 40 on Nov. 14, and the Bonnie
Prince Charlie of younger days has grown more somber, the sense of
guilt at all his privileges more apparent.
   There's still a lot of the fun-loving jetsetter left in him, but
the solemn face looks more lined and lived-in. The pate that will
one day wear the crown is balding. His taste in clothes runs to
conservative double-breasted suits. If he owns a pair of jeans, no
one in the outside world has seen him in them.
   Moving among his fellow citizens _ particularly the young, urban
unemployed who are his biggest concern _ he takes on what a
biographer, Alan Hamilton, calls ``the faintly puzzled air of a
bishop in a betting shop.''
   At times, the heir to the throne could pass for just another
1960s survivor coasting into middle age: married with two small
kids, he's into organic farming, alternative medicine, health food,
Jungian philosophy and the fate of ozone layer.
   What lifts him above the ordinary is that as Prince of Wales,
Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of
Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Great Steward of
Scotland, his destiny is to become King Charles III.
   That destiny looks far off. His mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is
healthy and vigorous at 62, and shows no inclination to abdicate in
favor of her son.
   Meanwhile, perhaps mindful of an earlier Prince of Wales who
frittered away 59 years waiting to be crowned King Edward VII, the
prince has made it clear that ``I am determined not to be confined
to cutting ribbons.''
   Charles' story, writes another biographer, Anthony Holden, ``is
one of constant struggle against the limitations placed upon him by
the genetic accident of his birth ... a confused and tortured soul
trying to come to terms with a claustrophobic, if comfortable life
of inherited imprisonment ... a caring and thoughtful man in search
of good to do.''
   That search has taken him on clandestine visits to London slums,
into the cowsheds of his tenant farmers, to the peatlands of the
Western Isles of Scotland and as far afield as the Kalahari Desert
in southern Africa's Botswana.
   His attempts to articulate what he has learned have suffered from
clumsiness, but as his themes become more polished, they tell as
much about his own state of mind as they do about the state of
Britain.
   Simply put, Charles stands for consensus in a society divided by
the uncompromising anti-consensus politics of Margaret Thatcher.
   Where the Conservative prime minister is embarked on a capitalist
revolution designed to create what she calls ``a go-getter
society,'' Charles gives voice to the fears of the losers in this
race for a leaner, tougher Britain.
   The problem for Charles is that when the issues are so
all-embracing, and consensus is a dirty word in Mrs. Thatcher's
book, just being neutral can seem like taking sides.
   ``We're in for a period of eight, 10, perhaps 20 years of
Conservative government, and therefore any criticism of the world as
it is sounds like a criticism of the government,'' says Norman
Tebbit, a former Conservative Party chairman.
   Thus when Charles attacks North Sea pollution, it is widely seen
as an attack on Mrs. Thatcher's government as insensitive to the
environment.
   When he decries unemployment, Thatcherites bristle at a perceived
criticism of the prime minister for having caused the unemployment.
If Charles laments poverty, the implication, intended or not, is
that Mrs. Thatcher doesn't care about the poor.
   Says biographer Hamilton: ``Mrs. Thatcher believes in the
meritocracy, and an individual in Mrs. Thatcher's Britain is all
right provided he can make it on his own. ... Mrs. Thatcher does not
sympathize with the underprivileged. Charles does.''

<TEXT>
   Tom Nairn, an anti-monarchist writer, says the irony is that if
there is any threat to the monarchy today, it comes not from the
left but from Tory right-wingers, traditional upholders of the royal
institution, who are irked by Charles' posture as conscience of the
nation.
   Nairn said in an interview that often, when he addresses
left-wing groups, ``I've had people say to me, `You mustn't
criticize Charles too much because he's on our side.'''
   A devotee of the small-is-beautiful ethos, Charles believes in
good works on a small, individual scale, and runs two charitable
trusts that dispense grants of up to 3,000 pounds ($5,000) to
unemployed people 18 to 25 years old to start a small business.
   About 1,800 people a year get grants, and the trusts have created
some 4,300 businesses. One of them, a Birmingham bakery, is making
the cake for his birthday party, which will be celebrated with a
street festival in the central England city.
   Blessed with a private $39-million fortune, Charles is the first
royal heir to forego his annual entitlement from taxpayers' funds.
   Also, although he doesn't have to pay income tax, he gives the
state one-quarter of the annual $3.4-million profit from his
130,000-acre farming estate, the Duchy of Cornwall.
   ``I cannot just sit there and do nothing,'' he told a BBC radio
interviewer a year ago. ``That's the way I've been brought up. I am
driven by the feeling I have had for a long time, by traveling
around this country and using my eyes, that I mind about the
conditions in which people live.''
   Last year he made a secret trip by van around a destitute
district of London's East End.
   Another time, after visiting immigrant workers from India's
Bengal in a garment sweatshop, he looked shaken and angry.
   ``This is really terrible,'' he exclaimed. ``All we are managing
to do is replicate some of the conditions these people have left
behind. ... It is really not acceptable. We must do something.''
   Although he insists on being bowed to and addressed as a Royal
Highness, he sometimes portrays himself in speeches as just another
ordinary, citizen fed-up with bureaucrats and conventional wisdoms.
   Attacking modern architects on grounds that they put people in
what he described as termite colonies, he said: ``Large numbers of
us in this country are fed up with being talked down to and dictated
to.''
   A bland ceremony opening a movie museum becomes a diatribe
against ``the palpable nonsense'' of experts who say screen violence
does no harm.
   Charles defines his role as being ``to stir things up, to throw a
proverbial royal brick through the plate glass of pompous and
professional pride.''
   What aggravates him most is a sense that his serious endeavors
are eclipsed by the media's obsession with royal trivia and the
state of his seven-year-old marriage to Princess Diana.
   They are 12 years apart, and their frequent separations have led
to frantic newspaper speculation about a possible divorce _ a notion
ridiculed by most royal insiders.
   The couple make no secret of the fact that they live partly
separate lives and have widely different interests _ she likes
fashion and pop music, he enjoys gardening, solitary walks and
painting in watercolors.
   As Hamilton points out, separate lives are not unusual among
British upper-class couples, for whom a primary purpose of marriage
is to produce ``an heir and a spare.''
   Charles and Diana have discharged that duty by having two sons.

   Here is some of what Prince Charles has had to say
on various issues in Britain:
   _On the plight of the unemployed, February, 1985: ``It is only
when you visit these areas, as I do from time to time, that you
begin to wonder how it is possible that people are able to live in
such inhuman conditions.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _On London's changing skyline, December, 1987: ``You have to give
this much to the Luftwaffe _ when it knocked down our buildings (in
World War II) it didn't replace them with anything more offensive
than rubble. We did that.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _On urban renewal problems, July, 1987: ``This is one of my rare
opportunities to stir things up, to throw a proverbial royal brick
through the plate glass of pompous and professional pride, and jump
feet first into the spaghetti bolognaise of red tape which covers
the country from one end to the other.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _On TV violence, September, 1988: ``If, as parents, you complain
that a diet of freely available and insensate violence is likely to
influence the way some people behave and relate to others, then you
are told there is absolutely no proof that violence on TV has any
effect on people's behavior. But that, as we all know, is palpable
nonsense.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _On the ozone layer in the environment, February, 1988: ``We are
always told that it is not scientifically proved, but I, personally,
as I have become older and more autocratic, have banned the use of
aerosols in my household.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _On charity rock concerts, September, 1985: ``If only I could
sing properly and squeeze myself into denims, I might achieve more.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _On his marriage to Princess Diana, 12 years his junior, October,
1985: ``I'm sure it must be absolute hell living with an ancient old
thing like me. ... I trust she'll keep me reasonably young in some
aspects.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _On getting involved in issues, December, 1987: ``It would be
much easier to lead a quieter life. I don't need to do this, but I
feel strongly about a lot of these things and I cannot do nothing
about it. If people would rather I did nothing I will go off
somewhere else.''

<HEAD>Charles Haid Plays Australian Tunnel Digger in `Great Escape'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   Charles Haid's longtime hobby of doing accents
came in handy when he was cast as an Australian soldier in the NBC
miniseries ``The Great Escape II: The Untold Story.''
   He plays Sgt. Mac MacKenzie in the four-hour, two-part series
that is a sequel to the blockbuster 1963 movie about the true story
of a huge escape of Allied airmen from a German prisoner-of-war camp
in World War II.
   ``He's a combination of a couple of guys,'' said Haid. ``Mostly a
Scot, who's still alive but was conveniently changed to an Aussie
for television. My character was a tunnel digger. Moles, they called
them.
   ``We filmed in Yugoslavia with a lot of British actors. My
biggest challenge was fitting in with their dialects. My hobby is
doing accents. I've been fascinated by accents since I was a kid. I
have a kind of parrot ear. Mostly what I did was listen to tapes.
Then all of a sudden,'' slipping into an Australian accent, ``you're
talkin' like that.''
   ``The Great Escape'' sequel will be broadcast by NBC on Sunday
and Monday, Nov. 6-7.
   Besides Haid, who starred as Officer Andy Renko for seven years
on ``Hill Street Blues,'' the movie also features Christopher Reeve,
Judd Hirsch, Anthony Denison, Michael Nader and Donald Pleasence.
Pleasence, who was an actual POW in World War II, played an Allied
prisoner in the 1963 movie, which starred Steve McQueen, James
Garner, Charles Bronson and Richard Attenborough. In the miniseries
Pleasence plays a German SS officer.
   The miniseries picks up the story of the escape and its bloody
aftermath, in which 50 recaptured prisoners were murdered. The
second half takes on aspects of a police chase as some of the
escaped POWs return to Germany after the war to track down those
responsible for the killings.
   ``We were in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, which is in the middle of
nowhere,'' Haid said of filming. ``We'd get in a car every morning
and drive out into the woods. The POW camp was built in the woods.
We'd pass woodsmen with their horses and wagons and axes. It was
like something from another century.
   ``It's a beautiful country. So much of it's untouched. I liked
it, but a lot of people didn't. The roads are pretty bad. But you
could turn a corner and step back into another century.''
   Haid said he plays the lovable old cuss in the miniseries. ``You
see them in every English war movie,'' he said. ``I'm the guy who
says, `It's awright, mate. You'll make it.' It's like a Victor
McLaglen part.''
   Haid was is the Navy in the early 1960s and served aboard a
nuclear submarine. After that he got a degree in directing from
Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1968. He began his career as an
associate producer of the musical hit ``Godspell,'' and since then
has swung back and forth between acting and producing.
   The first feature film he produced was ``Square Dance,'' followed
by ``Flying Blind,'' which hasn't been released yet. Future projects
are ``Ask the Dust,'' about Los Angeles in the 1930s, and ``The
Nightman,'' a thriller. He and actress Melanie Mayron have written a
comedy about mistaken identity.
   He also has a role in ``Home Room News,'' currently being filmed
in Indiana. ``It's great to be in a picture that's not about life
and death,'' he said before starting. ``I play a doctor whose
daughter wants to be a journalist, and he wants her to go to medical
school.
   ``I'm just a character actor. I'm finding it's wonderful and
freeing to be away from `Hill Street Blues.' It's good to get away
from a character as strong as Renko. I was in danger of being
typecast. It's also nice to be working. I haven't hit the wall so
many actors do after a series. That's because of `Hill Street.' It
was such a special show. It rubbed off on all the actors. It was a
turning point for television.''
   Haid did a pilot after ``Hill Street Blues'' called ``Fort
Figueroa'' that was not picked up as a series.
   ``I'm hopefully headed toward directing,'' he said. ``I've been
attending the University of Bochco, meaning I've been observing on
the set of `L.A. Law.''' Steven Bochco is the executive producer of
``L.A. Law'' and before that ``Hill Street Blues.''
   ``If I direct something I want to know how to do it first,'' he
said. ``I need the technical knowledge. I embarrass easily. I don't
want to try to direct and do something that will make me cringe. I
think people measure you by what you're attached to.''

<HEAD>Rita Moreno Plays Fading, Frantic Movie Star in `Closed Set'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rita Moreno didn't have to search for a role
model to play a movie star fighting desperately to save her sagging
career.
   ``She's a Joan Crawford kind of character,'' said Moreno, who
stars in the final episode of ``Tales From the Hollywood Hills'' on
Nov. 18 on PBS. ``The writer of the story knew her. It's a marvelous
role. Very showy.''
   ``The Closed Set'' is based on a short story by Gavin Lambert.
Moreno had a real-life encounter with Crawford that could have been
a scene from this scathing view of Hollywood _ or from ``Mommie
Dearest,'' Christina Crawford's tell-all book about her famous
mother.
   The encounter took place backstage at the Academy Awards in 1961,
when Moreno won as best supporting actress for ``West Side Story.''
   ``I flew in from Manila, where I was making a B picture, on the
off-chance that I would win over Judy Garland in `Judgment in
Nuremberg,''' she said. ``Joan Crawford, I think, was one of the
co-hosts. She had a dressing room right off the stage with a huge
Pepsi Cola cooler.
   ``I won the Oscar and I ran off stage and burst into tears. Joan
Crawford grabbed me and clutched me to her football field-sized
bosom. The photographers started taking pictures. She wouldn't let
go and she wouldn't let my face show. She kept posing for the
photographers. I couldn't breathe and the Oscar was digging into me.
Some big guy finally pried us apart.''
   That wasn't the end.
   ``A week later,'' Moreno said, ``I was back in Manila when I got
a letter on the famous blue stationery. She said, `Darling Rita, How
sweet and thoughtful of you to come and visit me in my dressing room
at the moment of your glory. Love, Joan.'''
   Moreno rocked with laughter. ``Visit her dressing room!'' she
said. ``She had a death grip on me and dragged me in.''
   While being interviewed, Moreno wore a purple dress that hugged
her svelte figure. On her dark, curly hair is a deep purple hat with
a rolled brim. She said fans often ask her how she keeps so thin.
She tells them diet, regular workouts and a strenuous concert act.
   In ``The Closed Set,'' she portrays actress Julie Forbes, who
hires a hot new director of a just-released art film for a quick fix
to her skidding career.
   ``She's doing a movie more or less based on her life, about her
start as a burlesque queen,'' said Moreno. ``He's in the Elia Kazan
mold. She's old Hollywood. He thinks he can finally get her to act.
But she gets scared. To her, an art film is harsh lighting and
wrinkles on her face.
   ``She sets out to sabotage his film and make it show. She bars
him from the set and completes the movie her way. The ending is very
much in the Hollywood tradition. She doesn't fall on her face. And
the director becomes famous for a film he doesn't want his name on.''
   The one-hour film is the last of six under the heading ``Tales
From the Hollywood Hills'' for ``Great Performances'' on PBS.
Previous episodes have been based on stories written by John O'Hara,
Budd Schulberg, F. Scott Fitzgerald, P.G. Wodehouse and William
Faulkner.
   Watch this film and you'll see why Moreno won that Oscar, as well
as a Tony, two Emmys and a Grammy. She is marvelous as the actress,
dripping honey one moment, hurling abuse the next. It also stars
D.W. Moffett as the young director and Harold Gould as the studio
boss. Mollie Miller directed from a screenplay by Ellen M. Violett.
   ``We turned out a four-week movie in 14 days,'' said Moreno. ``We
had wonderful people. That's why people work for PBS for almost
nothing. You get the best. You can get women. Our producer, director
and writer were all women. I think people do this because it's a
talent showcase.
   ``The networks would never let cinematographer Fred Elmes light
this the way he did. He used a lot of scrims on the lights and a lot
of pink, which gave very subtle, fleshy tones. The networks wouldn't
let you do this kind of story. PBS is a national treasure and we
have to look after it.''
   Moreno won her Tony in 1975 for ``The Ritz.'' Her Emmys were for
an appearance on ``The Muppets'' in 1977 and a guest star role on
``The Rockford Files'' in 1978. The Grammy was for her 1972
performance on ``The Electric Company Album.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The candidates' revels now are ended. For many,
that came not a moment too soon; the campaign, as polls have shown,
was widely decried as negative and uninformative, short on charisma,
long on insults. In this lively review, a reporter who has observed
presidential politics over four decades distills the essence of what

   In the first presidential election in American
history, in 1789, there were no primaries, no nominating
conventions, no campaign, no debates, no speeches.
   Envious?
   Though heavy with hot air of zealots and rascals, most of the
elections since then also offered American voters some fun and
entertainment in the torchlight parades, the bands and songs, the
wit and spark of combat.
   Had any fun lately?
   As campaigns go, this one, more than most, seemed mirthless and
endless, a battle of consultants and computers, of goofs and gaffes,
a pingpong match with square balls.
   A campaign in which the smoke-filled room was replaced by a room
full of machines, and charisma was outlawed. Instinct surrendered to
statistics and spontaneity was scripted. A campaign nasty without
passion, an argument without compelling differences, a game of
trivia for high stakes.
   George Bush, the new John Wayne, spent more time on the flag than
Betsy Ross. Michael Dukakis, said one observer, came across like a
man making a condolence call. Dan Quayle? The metaphors were
non-stop. Try ``reluctant Rambo.''
   The rhetoric was a notch above James Garfield's in 1880: ``A
pound of pluck is worth a ton of luck.'' The campaigning was less
sharp than the Republican line of 1948, ``To err is Truman.'' And
less original than Theodore Roosevelt's phrase for Woodrow Wilson in
1916: ``a Byzantine logothete,'' (functionary.)
   The debates of 1988 fell short of Lincoln-Douglas. Some viewers
found themselves yearning for the Carter-Ford debate of 1976 when
the sound went off and the two candidates for President of the
United States of America stared at each other and said absolutely
nothing for 27 delicious minutes. You could look it up.
   Still, this year had its special moments, none likely to be
treasured by the principals. With all the what-if questions put to
Quayle, George Bush, his sponsor, could not have enjoyed the many
reminders that, if elected, he might die in office, lose his mind or
be forced out in disgrace.
   Michael Dukakis could not have cherished that picture of him
riding in an army tank and wearing, it seemed, his father's helmet.
Objective observers agreed he probably could not project a warrior
image even with two pearl-handled revolvers on his hips and a knife
in his teeth.
   It was a campaign of awkward challenges and doltish questions
from the media. Prove you're not a wimp. Show me you're not an
iceberg. Convince me you're not a pea brain. What would be the first
thing you'd do if suddenly you were President. Well, what? Go to
war? Count the silver? And then (as if this were the key question
that would unravel the witness): If your wife were raped and
murdered, would you still oppose the death penalty?
   It took a cast of thousands to make The Making of a President
1988. But all of them, the stars, the supporting players, ingenues,
character actors and animal acts, the director, stage managers,
coaches and makeup artists, none ignited the critics more than the
blond, blue-eyed juvenile lead.
   With the exception of Richard Nixon, who was almost dropped
because of a secret fund, and Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to
be chosen, vice presidential nominees make the news the day they're
anointed and then they're gone, on the lesser circuits of political
vaudeville. It's considered good training for the job.
   Thus, history little noted the mighty labors of Lyndon Johnson on
the vice presidential stump in rural Virginia in 1960, soaring in
his peroration, pausing, descending and then, with that slit-eyed,
thin-lipped, high noon look, delivering the coup de grace. ``And so,
my friends, I ask you, what did Richard Nixon ever do for
Culpepper?''
   Dan Quayle was different. He couldn't fight his way off the front
page.
   First, a story that Dan Quayle, hawk, had nested in the National
Guard during the Vietnam War with family help. Then, boom-boom, a
story that Dan Quayle, student, was first rejected by his law school
for poor grades but finally was admitted. How? He insisted he got in
``fair and square'' and not, as reported, under a program to help
minorities and the poor, of which he was neither.
   And now came smiling, handsome, Dan Quayle, candidate for Vice
President, enriching man's search for enlightenment in diverse ways.

   Dukakis, he quipped, lost his ``top naval adviser. His rubber
ducky drowned in the bathtub.'' He invoked a spy novel to advocate
anti-satellite missiles. He referred to the Holocaust as ``an
obscene period in our nation's history'' and sought to recover by
saying ``I didn't live in this century.'' He mangled a basketball
coach's sentiments about offense and defense. Then, seeking to clear
the air, he brought forth a pasta which, should they stumble on it
in stone, promises to confound future archaeologists to the end of
time:
   ``Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable peace, a
better prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the first
place to have a reduction in offensive systems and an introduction
to defensive capability. I believe that is the route this country
eventually will go.''
   Marilyn Quayle did what she could. She protested that her husband
is intelligent, really is the ``studious sort'' who ``tries to read
Plato's Republic every year.''
   George Bush came perilously close to violating Section 4, Article
(d) of Public Law 829, which specifically stipulates that ``the flag
should never be used as drapery of any sort whatsoever.'' He wrapped
himself in Old Glory and never let go.
   He said he favored requiring public school teachers to lead
students in the pledge of allegiance to the flag while his rival was
opposed. In subsequent speeches, he wondered aloud why this path
toward eternal truth was so clear to him and not to Dukakis, who, he
implied, was denying children their birthright. He didn't say
Dukakis opposed a mandatory pledge on constitutional grounds.
   Dukakis went to Ellis Island and there, with the Statue of
Liberty behind him and 76 huge American flags waving in the breeze,
he placed his right hand over his heart and pledged his allegiance
and two days later Dan Quayle went to the Statue of Liberty and
placed his right hand over his heart and pledged his allegiance and
then the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pledge its
allegiance before every session and Bush made a speech before the
biggest flag imaginable at a flag factory and soon, everywhere the
candidates went, flags of all sizes multiplied like crab grass and
the multitudes were waving small flags given to them to wave, small
plastic flags made in Taiwan.
   It remained only for Ronald Reagan to hone the issue. He said he
did not ``see any reason why they should not learn the various
customs and so forth that have to do with things of that kind.''
   For candidates and public alike, Campaign 1988 proved an
endurance contest. It began more than two years and 876,432 speeches
ago. It involved 75 primaries and , at the peak, 14 candidates until
two of the Democrats were benched for philandering and plagiarism.
Finally Dukakis beat Jesse Jackson and four other Democrats. Bush
licked five Republicans and Dan Rather.
   By convention time, the two survivors seemed transformed. George
Bush, ex-wimp, broke from the barrier in full gallop, shooting from
both hips. Dukakis, ex-drone, seemed almost lyrical in his
acceptance speech. Campaigning, Bush grew more aggressive; Dukakis,
less poetic.
   Lloyd Bentsen confirmed that Dan Quayle was no John Kennedy, but
otherwise history will have difficulty remembering the debates of
1988. They provided some canned heat, less light. Most of the time,
the debaters did not answer questions. They fudged the beginning of
an answer and then _ one, two, three _ turned soulful eyes toward
the camera and, with great solemnity, rolled through their packaged
irrelevancies.
   On the stump, Bush fired off zingers like: Dukakis thinks a naval
maneuver is something in Jane Fonda's workout book. Dukakis came out
four-square for good jobs at good wages. In full stride, Bush fell
over Pearl Harbor Day and missed the event by four months. Dukakis
bitterly decried the dangers of foreign ownership at a Missouri
factory he didn't know was owned by Italians.
   Bush found some cops to endorse him. Dukakis found some cops on
his side. Bush said that Massachusetts ``is approaching a fiscal
fiasco...a budgetary Three Mile Island.'' Dukakis said anyone who
would say that about his state's economy ``must be suffering from
meltdown.''
   Bush blamed Dukakis for Boston's dirty harbor. Dukakis said Bush
was part of the administration's environmental ``wrecking crew.''
Bush said Dukakis was soft on crime. Dukakis said the Bush campaign
was ``racist.''
   On a Wednesday, the Dukakis camp issued a five-page document
titled ``George Bush Distorts Mike Dukakis' Record.'' On Thursday,
Bush headquarters issued 127 pages in rebuttal of the rebuttal.
Behind the infantry, the artillery of each man's computers could be
fired immediately.
   Boom, boom. Zap, zap. Ho, hum. The polls showed Bush was winning
but more people were turned off by both candidates.

   Americans' personal incomes rose a moderate 0.5
percent in September while consumer spending turned in its weakest
performance in almost a year, the government has said in reports
that offered fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that personal consumption
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic
activity, was unchanged in September following a 0.6 percent August
rise.
   It was the first time spending had failed to advance since a 0.2
percent drop in October 1987.

   The prices Americans pay for imported goods
fell 1.1 percent from July through September, the first decline in
more than two years, the government has reported.
   The Labor Department attributed the quarterly drop reported
Thursday to a fall in crude oil prices and a rise in the value of
the dollar against overseas currencies.
   A stronger dollar boosts Americans' purchasing power for foreign
goods and also tends to make U.S. exports more expensive. U.S.
export prices rose 2 percent during the July-September quarter.

<HEAD>Data Provide Further Evidence Of Slowing Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two government reports suggesting that consumers are spending
less and earning less on an inflation-adjusted basis provide further
evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing, according to some
analysts.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that consumer spending
slowed last month to its lowest level since a 0.2 percent decline
last October. Personal consumption spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of overall economic activity, was unchanged in September
following a 0.6 percent August rise.
   Taking the rise in prices into account, consumer spending
actually fell 0.5 percent last month, the department reported.
   In addition, the government said personal income rose 0.5 percent
but the gain was completely erased by rising inflation.
   ``Consumers are being more tight-fisted because their incomes are
going nowhere,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill
Lynch & Co. Inc. ``They already have so much debt that they are
unwilling to borrow any more.''
   Some economists viewed the report as further evidence of an
economic slowdown following Wednesday's government report that the
gross national product _ the broadest measure of the economy _ grew
at a slower pace in the third quarter.
   The GNP rose at an annual rate of just 2.2 percent from July
through September, according to that report. It was the slowest rate
in almost two years and followed GNP growth of 3.2 percent in the
first half of 1988.
   Many economists believe the economy will continue slowing over
the next year, with the biggest question being whether growth will
become so weak that it could topple the country into a recession.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar firmed against most major
currencies after falling to its lowest level in four months on
Wednesday. Market observers attributed the currency's strength to
apparent central bank intervention, although some economists
predicted the dollar would continue to weaken. In New York trading,
the dollar rebounded to 126.08 yen from its 125.70-yen value
Wednesday.
   Also Thursday, stock prices tumbled in selling attributed to
investors' misgivings over the recent wave of corporate buyout bids.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 24.35 to 2,140.83.
   In other economic news Thursday,
   _The Labor Department said the prices Americans pay for imported
goods fell 1.1 percent from July through September. It was the first
decline in more than two years and was attributed to a fall in crude
oil prices and a rise in the value of the dollar.
   _A new study shows Midwest economies are growing faster than any
other region. Minneapolis, Detroit, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Mo.,
St. Louis, Cleveland and Pittsburgh are growing faster than New York
and other Eastern cities, according to Grant Thornton, a New
York-based accounting firm.
   _An economic forecast suggests rising mortgage interest rates and
high vacancy rates will push new construction contracts down 4
percent next year to a total of $241 billion. McGraw-Hill
Information Services Co. said new building contracting declined
about 3 percent in the first nine months of 1988 from the same 1987
period.

   Energy futures prices remain mixed, amid a lack

   Analysts said technical factors continued dominating Thursday's
trading session, pushing home heating oil futures sharply higher,
boosting crude oil futures and depressing unleaded gasoline futures.
   ``I think we're going to continue to see this until some
substantial action comes out of OPEC,'' said Bob Baker, senior
energy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was scheduled
to meet next month to discuss controlling production as a way of
propping up worldwide oil prices, which have fallen sharply in
recent weeks.
   Iran's oil minister said Thursday that his country would accept a
further fall in oil prices rather than agreeing to an OPEC
production quota equal to Iraq, Iran's foe in the 8-year Persian
Gulf War.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, gained 27 cents
Thursday to $13.68 a barrel after rising 15 cents on Wednesday.
Other contract months also rose.
   Among refined products, the November contract for unleaded
gasoline settled at 50.72 cents a gallon, down 0.95 cent. The
contract had declined slightly on Wednesday.
   The November contract for home heating oil, which rose 1.19 cents
in the previous session, closed up another 1.49 cents at 43.04 cents
a gallon.
   Baker said gasoline prices, which had risen recently, were too
high for this time of year. He said the shift toward heating oil
represented a ``rapid market correction.''
   ``The season puts the demand more focused on the heating oil,''
he said.

<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than a week of overdosing on
mega-deals, the fear of failure has given Wall Street traders and
speculators a reason to just say no to merger mania.
   Dragged down by sharp declines in key takeover issues, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials fell 24.35 points on Thursday,
closing at 2,140.83.
   The new wave of multibillion-dollar buyouts relies heavily on
debt, and many observers are concerned that the financing of these
deals ultimately may prove too fragile.
   ``This is not business as usual,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. of the high
level of debt mandated in these transactions. ``When you take a
blue-chip company and turn it into a buffalo-chip company, it's not
a good situation.''
   Reflecting skepticism over Kohlberg Kravis Robert & Co.'s ability
to fund its $20.3 billion tender offer for RJR Nabisco Inc.,
Nabisco's stock fell $2.75 share to $82.
   Other takeover issues also lost substantial ground, including
Kraft Inc., which fell $3 to $94.50; West Point-Pepperell Inc.
plunged $3.37{ to $44.50, and Pillsbury Co. slipped $2.12{ to
$58.87{. Also down were so-called ``whisper'' stocks, which had
risen on spillover speculation.
   ``There's too much debt supporting the nation's corporations,
that's what this is telling us,'' said Philip Puccio, a senior vice
president at Dillon Read & Co.
   Amplifying worries over the size of the recent deals were two
developments. In the corporate bond market, where the billions
needed to finance the deals are raised, a $1.15 billion junk bond
sale for Campeau Corp.'s takeover of Federated Department Stores hit
a major snag.
   Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has urged
banks to be cautious about lending money for multibillion-dollar
takeovers and buyouts. Greenspan's warning came in a letter to the
Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday.
   ``Institutions have participated in so much of this debt
financing that (the financial community) is starting to worry,''
said Puccio. ``They're afraid that if this thing does keep building
the way it is and corporate America becomes a house of cards, it can
collapse the way the stock market did.''
   Transactions that are dependent upon a high level of debt are
losing much of their allure. For example, Wall Street Journal report
that U.S. Shoe Corp. is considering a leveraged buyout was said to
be a factor in sending the company's stock tumbling $1.37{ to $24.25.
   Before the recent rash of deals, analysts agree, such a report
would have driven the company's stock higher.
   In the junk bond market, underwriter First Boston Corp. said that
while it had not officially withdrawn its offering for the Federated
deal, it was engaged in discussions to restructure the transaction.
   Proceeds from the sale of these high-risk bonds were destined to
pay off bridge loans used to cover the short-term costs of the
Campeau takeover announced last spring. A delay could spell trouble
for the banks and investment houses that provided that financing.
   ``If this causes some players to sit on the sidelines because
they committed too much capital, then maybe they'll think twice next
time,'' Brusca said.
   Because the recent deals all involve huge amounts of borrowed
money, they could be devastated by higher interest rates or the
inability of a company to sell off assets to cover the debt. Some
observers also fear there aren't enough investors interested in
purchasing billions of new junk bonds.
   But Michael Dahood, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., contends there is a hefty appetite for larger deals. ``I don't
think deals that have a sound economic basis should have any
difficulty getting funded,'' he said.
   The problem, however, is broader than one firm and one
transaction.
   ``I'm concerned about the fact that at any point in time there
are a lot of firms that are highly leveraged,'' said Gregg Jarrell,
former Securities and Exchange Commission economist and now a
professor at the University of Rochester.
   ``No one can really know the full extent of what could happen if
the economy turned down,'' he said.

<HEAD>Plant Closing Law Gives Wall Street Something Else to Worry About</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street investment firms worried about how to
escape a post-crash malaise may have an unforeseen problem on their
hands: the new plant-closing law that could constrict their
flexibility to cut staff.
   Labor lawyers said Thursday that the plant closing bill, which by
its name suggests only blue-collar industries, applies to all
companies employing at least 100 people.
   The measure requires employers who close operations and lay off
large numbers of workers to give employees 60 days advance notice,
and penalizes those that do not.
   In the financial services business, affected workers could
include anyone from an $8-an-hour computer clerk to the
$500,000-a-year securities research analyst.
   ``I don't think the investment banking houses or brokerage houses
have focused on this,'' said Stuart Bompey, a labor lawyer at the
New York firm of Baer, Marks & Upham, which represents some big
financial services concerns such as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dun &
Bradstreet Corp. ``People thought it affected only an industrial
facility, but it clearly affects every employer.''
   The bill, which became law Aug. 4, comes at a vulnerable time for
Wall Street, which has been struggling since the October 1987 market
crash. At least 15,000 people have been laid off since then and
there are expectations of that another 5,000 could lose their jobs.
   Moreover, considerable confusion surrounds the enforcement date
of the bill, which is supposed to take effect Feb. 4. It remains
unclear whether employers must notify workers of layoffs 60 days
before the February date, which would be Dec. 6.
   Some lawyers are telling Wall Street clients to send out the pink
slips now in case the Labor Department's Employment Training
Administration, which is drafting regulations to implement the new
law, decides Dec. 6 is the effective date.
   ``I know attorneys within my firm are advising clients who are
considering or planning layoffs that fall within the ambiguous
period to be safe and provide the notice,'' said Margaret Bryant, an
associate attorney at Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman in New
York, which specializes in labor law and counsels some of the
biggest Wall Street firms.
   ``There's a concern, especially as people become more aware of
it,'' she said. ``Certainly clients who call us saying, `We're
planning a layoff,' are going to be counseled to the max on what
this law's provisions are.''
   The Securities Industry Association, a trade group of brokerages,
first sounded the alarm by telling members in a memorandum last
month that the ``new `plant closing' bill applies to all firms.''
   The memo warned executives and personnel managers that ``the
statute is complex and should be carefully reviewed by you and-or
your legal counsel for its implications for your firm.''
   The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, as it
officially is called, penalizes violators by making them pay
affected employees for each day in which adequate notice isn't
given, which in effect could amount to a maximum of two months'
worth of severance pay. Violators also must pay the local community
government $500 for each day's violation.
   Although the law provides for numerous exceptions, such as
unexpected changes in the economy or a natural disaster, many
manufacturers fought the law on grounds it reduced management
flexibility.
   The law's key author, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, notes the
inspiration for the law came from the emotional issue of
manufacturing plant closings and mass layoffs, which put more than
400,000 people out of work last year.
   ``It is true that the senator didn't envision Wall Street when he
originally offered the bill,'' said Nancy Coffey, his press
secretary. ``But he also feels all workers deserve adequate notice
if they're going to be losing their jobs.''
   Officials of several big brokerages have indicated they are
considering new layoffs, but so far only Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
has done so. The firm confirmed earlier this week that it is laying
off about 1,000 people by year-end.

<HEAD>Grand Met Extends Buyout Offer By One Week; Criticizes Pillsbury
For Inaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pillsbury Co. has pursued a ``costly
strategy'' to prevent its shareholders from considering an
unsolicited $60-a-share tender offer from Grand Metropolitan PLC,
the British suitor says in letter to Pillsbury Chairman Philip Smith.
   The letter was made public Thursday after Grand Metropolitan
extended by one week its $5.2 billion offer to purchase the
Minneapolis-based food and restaurant company. It said Pillsbury has
refused to meet with Grand Met to discuss the offer, which Grand Met
has said is negotiable.
   ``We do not understand how you can explore and investigate all
available alternatives without meeting with us to discuss our
proposal,'' the letter said. ``Based on your public disclosures, our
offer is the only existing third-party proposal to acquire Pillsbury
and you have not made any alternative proposals other than the vague
statement...that `remaining independent would be a superior
alternative over the long term.'''
   The letter was signed by Ian A. Martin, chief executive of Grand
Metropolitan's U.S. operations, and Allen Sheppard, chairman and
group chief executive in London.
   ``You have refused to meet with us,'' the letter said. ``Instead
you have pursued a costly strategy designed to prevent Pillsbury's
stockholders from having an opportunity to consider our offer.''
   Johhny Thompson, vice president of public relations for
Pillsbury, said the company had no response to the tender offer
extension or the letter.
   The tender offer was to expire Nov. 1 but has been extended at
the same price until Nov. 8, said Walter Montgomery, a spokesman for
Grand Metropolitan in New York.
   Smith announced Oct. 17 that Pillsbury's directors voted
unanimously to reject the offer as inadequate, and directed
management to pursue alternatives.
   In a letter to Pillsbury employees dated Wednesday, Smith said
the company was not ready to announce alternatives, but believed
Pillsbury shareholders should not tender their stock to Grand Met.
   Pillsbury stock tumbled $2.12{ a share to $58.87{ on Thursday as
takeover-related stocks took a beating on Wall Street.
   Steve Carnes, a former Pillsbury executive who is an analyst with
Piper Jaffray & Hopwood Inc. of Minneapolis, said the extension
gives Pillsbury some breathing room to plan.
   Pillsbury declined to comment on reports that its board of
directors met all day Wednesday to consider alternatives to the
Grand Met offer.
   Carnes said he believes Pillsbury's directors are favoring a
financial restructuring that could include the sale of Burger King
and other restaurants to raise cash for a special dividend to
shareholders.
   Pillsbury is pursuing lawsuits in state courts seeking to block
the takeover bid on the grounds that liquor producers are barred in
several states from selling alcohol at retail outlets.
   Grand Metropolitan, which has interests in distilling,
restaurants and consumer goods, has said it would sell off
Pillsbury's Steak & Ale and Bennigan's restaurants because of those
laws.

<HEAD>Current Account Surplus Falls 10 Percent From Previous Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's current account surplus dipped 10.6 percent
in September from a year earlier to $7.605 billion, but surged 52.4
percent from August, the Finance Ministry announced Friday.
   In another report, the Management and Coordination Agency
announced Japan's unemployment rate registered 2.5 percent in
September, down from 2.6 percent the previous month.
   The surplus in Japan's current account, the broadest measure of a
nation's trade and financial flows, has continued to decline from
year-earlier levels since January. In August, it registered $4.991
billion, while in September 1987 it totaled $8.509 billion.
   Japanese exports in September grew 14.2 percent from their
year-earlier level to $22.698 billion, while imports surged 25.6
percent to $13.891 billion, the ministry said.
   Ministry officials attributed the year-to-year decline in the
current account surplus to the growth of imports, particularly of
manufactured goods. They said imports would have increased faster in
value if they had not been held down by low international oil prices.
   But the officials said demand continued to grow overseas for
Japanese exports such as semiconductors, video tape recorders,
televisions and office equipment.
   Tourism payments showed a deficit of $1.398 billion, down
slightly from the record $1.582 billion deficit recorded the
previous month.
   The officials declined to predict future trends for Japan's trade
balance, but said exports were likely to remain strong, possibly
endangering efforts by Japan to reduce its trade surplus.
   The Management and Coordiantion Agency said Japanese companies
continued to actively hire new employees, with the number of workers
in the manufacturing and service sectors rising by 1.15 million or
2.6 percent from a year earlier to 45.23 million.
   It was the fifth consecutive month in which the number of
non-farm employees rose by 1 million or more. The total number of
people employed rose by 840,000, or 1.4 percent, to 60.64 million,
the agency said.
   Japan's jobless rate would be higher if it were measured by U.S.
and European standards. In Japan, armed forces personnel and people
employed more than one hour in the last week of the month _ when
statistics are tabulated _ are considered employed.

<HEAD>GM Sets 3rd Quarter Earnings Record, Outearns Ford for First Time
in a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has posted an industry record
$859.2 million in third-quarter earnings, and in so doing broke out
from under the financial thumb of Ford Motor Co.
   While GM reported record earnings Thursday, Chrysler Corp. said
its third-quarter profits fell 54.3 percent when compared with the
same period last year.
   GM's earnings surprised Wall Street analysts and sent the
nation's largest automaker's stock up $2.87{ a share to $80.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   The company's earnings, which translated to $2.46 a share, came
on sales of $25.04 billion. That was an increase of 104 percent from
$421 million, or $1.05 a share, on sales of $22.6 billion during the
third quarter last year, when GM's results reflected a one-time
accounting change.
   Thursday was the first time in five quarters that GM has
outearned Ford. On Wednesday, the No. 2 automaker reported
third-quarter earnings of $856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, on sales
of $17.73 billion.
   ``I was (predicting) up at the high end (at $2 a share) of where
the world was ...'' said analyst Maryann Keller of Furman Selz Mager
Dietz & Birney in New York.
   ``The consensus for guys on Wall Street for the third quarter was
a $1.50 (per share),'' said Kathleen Heaney of Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc. in New York.
   Keller, Heaney and GM agreed that GM's performance began a
rebound in North America, and continued to be strong overseas.
   For the first nine months of 1988, GM said it earned $3.46
billion, or $10.09 per share, up 27.4 percent from $2.72 billion, or
$7.70 per share, during the January-September period last year.
Sales for the first nine months of this year amounted to $81.38
billion, up 7.9 percent from the $75.4 billion in sales during the
first three quarters of 1987.
   Chrysler said it earned $112.5 million, or 50 cents a share, on
sales of $7.01 billion during the July-September period this year.
During the three-month period last year, Chrysler said it earned
$246 million, or $1.12 a share, on sales of $6.17 billion.
   The No. 3 automaker said its earnings were hurt by high costs of
incentives, used extensively by Chrysler to lure buyers into
showrooms, and the closing for the entire period of its Newark,
Del., assembly plant for retooling.
   That plant resumed production this week, beginning to make the
new Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim.
   For the first nine months of this year, Chrysler's earnings fell
34.4 percent to $616.6 million, or $2.77 a share, from $939.5
million, or $4.33 a share, last year. Sales for the first nine
months of 1988 amounted to $23.17 billion, compared with $18.61
billion in 1987, a 24.5 percent increase.
   Meanwhile, Chrysler Financial Corp. said Thursday it earned a
record $59 million in the third quarter, 20 percent more than the
$49 million it earned during the July-September period last year.
For the January-September period this year, the financial arm of the
corporation earned $185 million, a nine-month record and up 12
percent from the $166 million it earned during the first nine months
of last year.

<TEXT>
   Two powerful members of the Wall Street
establishment have joined forces to challenge Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co.'s proposed $20.3 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.
   The investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc. said late Thursday it
was joining Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and a group of top managers
at RJR Nabisco who are considering a challenge to Kohlberg Kravis
for control of the Atlanta-based cigarette and food giant.
   ``The combination of Salomon Brothers and Shearson Lehman Hutton
forms a team with extraordinary capital strength and capabilities,''
F. Ross Johnson, the president and chief executive of RJR Nabisco,
said in a prepared statement.
   Johnson leads the group of managers who last week announced they
were considering offering to buy the company for $17 billion in
cooperation with Shearson. He said ``numerous'' other firms had
expressed interest in supporting a bid.
   RJR Nabisco's stock rose 75 cents a share to $82.75 in early
trading today on the New York Stock Exchange. It fell $2.75 a share
on Thursday, before Salomon's entry was announced.
   The price decline indicated doubts about the cash value of the
Kohlberg Kravis $90-a-share tender offer as well as broader concerns
about the health of the takeover business.
   Kohlberg Kravis, which launched its tender offer Thursday, said
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission it was
``extremely confident'' it could raise the money to complete the bid.
   Kohlberg Kravis has lined up some big-league Wall Street backers
of its own. It said in its SEC filing that Morgan Stanley & Co.,
Wasserstein, Perella & Co., Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets were assisting it in structuring and financing
the buyout offer.
   Analysts said they believed Kohlberg Kravis could raise the
money, but said that because the offer was not all cash, it actually
was worth less than $90 a share.
   RJR Nabisco's stock price had been inflated by expectations that
a higher bid might be forthcoming, and the price fell Thursday as
that speculation waned. The company's managers originally said they
were considering an offer of about $75 a share in cash.
   Dampening the speculative fever for takeover targets were
comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has
contended banks should be cautious about lending too much money for
leveraged buyouts.
   In a sign that it still hoped to avoid full-scale hostilities,
Kohlberg Kravis said its offer for RJR Nabisco was conditioned on
signing a merger agreement with the board of directors.
   Since its founding in 1976, Kohlberg Kravis has never acquired a
company without the support of the target's board.
   Getting the support of directors and at least some managers would
ensure a smoother transition if Kohlberg Kravis succeeded in taking
over the company.
   Kohlberg Kravis made its tender offer to shareholders only after
failing to reach agreement with RJR Nabisco's managers and Shearson
on some kind of a joint bid for the company.
   Kohlberg Kravis, a privately-owned partnership, has become one of
the United States' largest industrial holding companies by buying
out companies with the participation of their managers.
   In its SEC filing, Kohlberg Kravis said it would require about
$20.15 billion to buy all of RJR Nabisco's shares and to pay related
fees and expenses. It said additional funds might be required to
cover RJR Nabisco's long-term debt, which it said is $5.11 billion.
   Kohlberg Kravis said that if its bid succeeded, it anticipated
selling some of the company's assets, but said it had no definite
plans.
   Investment firms participating in the deal will reap huge fees.
According to the SEC filing, about $2.5 billion of the money raised
for the deal would go for fees and expenses. It was not stated how
much would be for fees and how much for other types of expenses.

   Stock prices rose slightly Friday as worries about
Wall Street and the close of a two-week trading account curtailed
volume and interest in speculative moves.
   Traders said the underlying tone of the market remained firm,
however, after Thursday's surprise narrowing of the British trade
deficit.
   The improved trade figures and a steady pound should provide
support for British equities in the near term, even if New York
share prices take a dive, some dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 2.5

   Volume was a light 262.4 million shares, down from 315.9 million
shares traded by the same time Thursday.

   Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive officer,

   The company retained First Boston Corp. as adviser to sell the

   The New York Times Co. also has interests in newspapers,

   The stock market turned upward today, rebounding
from Thursday's broad decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.60 to 2,150.43 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 329 up, 166 down and
313 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.39 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Thursday's drop hit hardest among stocks that were known or
rumored to be targets of takeovers and buyouts.
   The selling came as increasing numbers of analysts voiced concern
over the amounts of debt being built up in corporate America.
   But once having delivered that message, investors seemed willing
to look again today at individual deals that are likely to go
through, presenting the opportunity for trading profits.
   Also, analysts said the overall market got a lift from General
Motors, which issued a third quarter earnings report Thursday that
was much better than expected.
   GM shares, up 2~ on Thursday, rose another 2| to 83[ in early
trading today.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.82 to 156.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .79 at 301.43.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 24.35 to
2,140.83.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 4 to 1 on the

   Under an agreement signed Thursday, Boeing will deliver the
wide-bodied jetliners in early 1990, the announcement said.
   Olympic said it chose the Boeings in July over the European-made
Airbus 300 and 310 because a 767 costs $48 million less than an
Airbus.
   The Greek airline also signed an agreement to fit the aircraft
with Pratt & Whitney jet engines rather than the General Electic
turbofans normally used on Boeing aircraft.

<HEAD>Utilities Weighing $200 Million-Plus Settlement Proposal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorneys in the Washington Public Power Supply
System securities fraud trial are negotiating for a settlement of
$200 million or more, possibly involving all 15 remaining utility
defendants, sources in the case say.
   The trial in U.S. District Court in Tucson, Ariz., was recessed
suddenly Thursday by Judge William Browning, who said he sought the
break to assist efforts which ``may be productive in shortening the
trial.''
   The trial was adjourned until Wednesday, and several utility
officials confirmed meetings were scheduled as early as Monday to
discuss a settlement offer from attorneys for WPPSS bondholders.
   The suit was filed after WPPSS stopped making payments in 1983 on
$2.25 billion in bonds, the biggest default in municipal bond
history. The bonds had been issued to finance two nuclear power
projects that were scrapped in 1982.
   Sources said Thursday the proposed settlement could exceed $200
million, would involve the federal Bonneville Power Administration
and would require approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.
   At BPA headquarters in Portland, Ore., Bob Reed conceded ``there
is some activity'' but referred inquiries to Harvey Spigal, legal
counsel to the federal power-marketing agency, who was not available
late Thursday.
   ``Attorneys are working on something, and they say they'll tell
us on Monday,'' said BPA spokeswoman Karen Hoenes.
   BPA, which backed financing of three other WPPSS nuclear power
plants, sells and distributes electricity generated at federal dams
in the Pacific Northwest and is the region's largest power broker
with an annual budget of $3 billion.
   ``A proposal has been proposed that I have recommended my clients
take a look at and discuss,'' said Albert Malanca, attorney for
Tacoma City Light, one of the largest defendants in the case.
   Malanca said a special meeting of the Tacoma City Council and
Utility Board was set for Monday morning, about the same time as a
meeting of commissioners of the Cowlitz County Public Utility
District, another major defendant.
   ``They will discuss an offer of settlement by the plaintiffs,''
said Cowlitz PUD manager Bob McKinney said. He added that he
expected details of the offer to be disclosed at that time.
   Officials of the Klickitat County, Franklin County and Mason
County No. 3 PUDs also said meetings on the matter were scheduled or
likely early in the week.
   A meeting of Snohomish County PUD commissioners was set for
Tuesday.
   Mel Weiss, an attorney for the bondholders, said a settlement
announcement could come next week. He refused to comment further,
except to say that the trial would continue in any event.
   Besides the 15 utilities, defendants include two engineering
firms and a financial advice firm. There has been no talk of
settlement involving the professional firms, and attorneys with two
of the firms said Thursday there were no talks involving their
clients.
   In the trial, which began Sept. 7 and is expected to last as long
as a year, a class of more than 24,000 past and present bondholders
and Chemical Bank of New York, as trustee for bondholders, claim
there was a conspiracy to lie and hide information that might have
discouraged potential investors.
   Originally, defendants numbered more than 100, including 88
public utilities that contracted with WPPSS to build the plants, but
most _ including WPPSS itself _ reached settlements that total $365
million in cash and $96 million in contested insurance claims over
the past year.
   A $200 million settlement could bring total settlements to $650
million to $700 million. Though the default involved $2.25 billion
in bonds, claims in the suit amount to about $1.5 billion.
   Thus, the total settlements could approach 50 cents on the dollar
for bond investors before legal fees.

   The investor group whose buyout offer was snubbed
earlier this month by TW Services Inc. said it would begin a $29 a
share tender offer today as the first step of a proposed $1.14
billion takeover of the food services giant.
   Coniston Partners' cash tender offer for 15.75 million shares,
amounting to about $456.75 million, if successful would give it a
majority stake in TW Services, which on Oct. 12 rejected the group's
proposal for a $28 a share buyout.
   The group, which already owns about 19 percent of TW's 48.5
million common shares outstanding, said Thursday it intended
eventually to acquire the remaining shares of TW in a subsequent
merger for $29 a share, giving the entire buyout an indicated value
of about $1.14 billion.
   TW had no immediate comment on Coniston's new offer, TW spokesman
James Ryan said today. ``The board will consider it'' and issue a
statement afterwards, he said. Ryan said he couldn't specify when
the TW board will meet.
   Coniston said the two-step buyout plan was aimed at sidestepping
restrictions of the anti-takeover law of Delaware, where TW is
incorporated. The group also said it filed a suit in U.S. District
Court for Delaware to block the anti-takeover law.
   The statute prohibits a hostile acquirer who buys 15 percent of a
company's stock from completing a takeover for three years unless it
immediately gets approval from 85 percent of the company's
outstanding shares, excluding its own.
   Acquiring a majority stake would enhance Coniston's chances of
winning a shareholder election, and would give it substantial power
over the TW board of directors, which is empowered to exempt the
company from the takeover law.
   Coniston said that if it succeeded in blocking or setting aside
the law's requirements, it intended to consumate a $29-a-share
merger ``as soon as practicable.''
   TW Services is parent of the Denny's restaurant chain and a major
franchisee of Hardee's fast food restaurants. In rejecting
Coniston's $28 a share offer as inadequate, the company's board also
indicated it believed shareholders would be best served if the
company remained independent.
   Coniston indicated at that time it was considering a hostile
buyout offer.
   The tender offer was announced after the close of business on
Thursday, and a secretary said no one was available at TW Services'
New York headquarters to comment on the offer.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, TW closed at $25 share, unchanged
from Wednesday.
   Coniston, with a warchest estimated at about $700 million,
typically takes large positions in companies and uses that clout to
force management to sell the company or make changes that boost the
stock price. It successfully forced a buyout of Allegis Corp. in
1987 but recently lost a bid to force the sale of Gillette Co.,
although it won an agreement for the company to buy back its
Gillette stock.
   In making its initial offer for TW, Coniston stressed that it was
interested in owning rather than splitting up and selling the
company.
   When Coniston made its $28-a-share offer, Wall Street analysts
agreed with the partnership that the offer was reasonable, but some
estimated that TW's break-up value might be as high as $34 a share.
   In addition to its 1,200 Denny's and its 400 Hardee's fast food
franchise restaurants, New York-based TW also runs Canteen Corp., a
food services concern, and a small nursing home chain.
   TW reported net income of $47.2 million on sales of $2.5 billion
in 1987.

   The stock market headed higher today, rebounding
from Thursday's broad decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 24.35 on Thursday,
rose 13.86 to 2,154.69 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 777 up, 386 down and

   Volume on the Big Board came to 51.51 million shares at
midmorning.
   Thursday's drop hit hardest among stocks that were known or
rumored to be targets of takeovers and buyouts.
   The selling came as increasing numbers of analysts voiced concern
over the amounts of debt being built up in corporate America.
   But once having delivered that message, investors seemed willing
to look again today at individual deals that are likely to go
through, presenting the opportunity for trading profits.
   Also, analysts said the overall market got a lift from General

was much better than expected.
   GM shares, up 2~ on Thursday, rose another 3\ to 83} on turnover
of more than 2 million shares today.
   Among big takeover targets, RJR Nabisco gained 1\ to 83\ and
Kraft was up [ at 94|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

<HEAD>OSHA Slaps Meatpacker With $4.33 Million Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration today fined John Morrell & Co. $4.33 million, the
largest fine ever against a single employer, for what the agency
said were hundreds of ``willful safety and health violations'' at
the meatpacker's Sioux Falls, S.D., plant.
   OSHA said Morrell knew as early as 1984 that working conditions
at the plant were causing ``serious and sometimes disabling
cumulative trauma injuries'' but did nothing to change those
conditions.
   The company's own injury and illness records showed that 880 of
2,000 employees at the plant sustained such injuries, caused by long
periods of repetitive motion, from ay 1987, to April 1988, the
government said.
   ``This case involves an employer who knew about a serious health
hazard, saw the tragic toll on its workers and chose to ignore it,''
said Assistant Labor Secretary John A. Pendergrass.
   OSHA officials said ergonomics specialists from the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found during an
inspection begun six months ago that 722 employees were being
exposed daily to a significant risk of cumulative trauma disorders
from repeated hand, wrist and arm motions. The most common form of
the affliction, officials said, is carpal tunnel syndrome.
   Pendergrass said the incidence of cumulative trauma disorders
among workers at the Sioux Falls plant was nine times greater than
the meatpacking industry average of 4.8 per 100 full-time workers
per year and 600 times the rate for all U.S. industries.
   Morrell said in a statement that it considered the fine ``grossly
unfair and totally unjustified.'' The company hinted that it might
take the matter to court.
   Pendergrass said that many of the disorders could have been
easily prevented.
   ``The design of knives, for instance, can reduce trauma,''
Pendergrass said, adding that the biggest improvement needed was a
change in the ``attitudes of management.''
   Under the law, Morrell has 15 days to pay the fine or appeal it
to a Labor Department review board.
   In its statement, Morrell said it was considering seeking an
injunction ``to stop OSHA from singling us out for penalties and
imposition of arbitrary standards for what is clearly a national,
multi-industry safety and health problem.''
   Morrell also said that its on-the-job safety record had improved
dramatically this year.
   Morrell said injuries needing to be reported to OSHA, expressed
as injuries per 1,000 full-time workers, had fallen from 70.5 in
January to 16.75 in October.
   The company's statement also maintained that ``the simplest and
most reliable method'' of avoiding excessive repetitive motions''
was varying workers' daily routines. But, the meatpacker said,
``union work rules and the grievance process have often been used to
block'' such changes.
   The $4.33 million fine was arrived at by calculating penalties
for what OSHA officials said were deliberate violations of federal
safety standards in a willful disregard of the law. Included were
$5,000 fines each _ half the maximum allowed _ for 722 workers
exposed to cumulative trauma disorders which OSHA said the company
had made no effort to prevent through available engineering or
administrative controls.
   The company was fined $710,000 for what OSHA called 71 separate
instances in which workers with the disorder _ some of whom required
surgery _ were given insufficient time off or denied lighter work
duties while the injuries were healing.
   The agency found that 63 workers underwent surgery between May
1987, and May 1988, but were given an average of only 1.1 days off.
Twenty-seven of them had no days off, the government said.
   NIOSH recommends 30 to 60 days off depending on the type of
surgery.
   The company was fined $10,000 for exposing workers who suffered
the injuries to the risk of aggravating them by not giving them time
off.
   OSHA officials said that 93 percent, or 817, of the 888 workers
with recorded trauma disorders had no time off and 39 percent, or
345, had no benefit of temporary work restrictions.
   OSHA last May fined another giant meatpacker, IBP Corp., $3.1
million for similar violations at its Dakota City, Neb., plant.
   Previously, the largest fine assessed against one employer was a
$4.11 million levy in 1987 against the Bath Iron Works of Maine,
primarily for construction safety violations. OSHA and the company
last week agreed to a $650,000 settlement, with Bath Iron Works
agreeing to a company-wide program to end the dangerous conditions
and a variety of other conditions.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted
today to ban lawn darts, which have been implicated in several
recent deaths and injuries of children, and to extend a ban on
three-wheel all-terrain vehicles.
   The commission voted 2-0 to prohibit sale of lawn darts, a ban
which could take effect as soon as December, prior to the Christmas
shopping rush.
   Commissioner Carol Dawson abstained from the vote, but issued a
plea for adults who already have lawn darts in their homes to keep
them out of the hands of children.
   In the last 10 years, an estimated 150 to 200 youngsters have
suffered severe injuries when these heavy darts struck and
penetrated their skulls, the commission was told.
   Action on the ban coincided with an unfolding drama in Tennessee,
where an 11-year-old McMinnville girl was kept comatose after
undergoing eight hours of emergency surgery to remove a lawn dart
from her skull. The accident occurred as the girl was playing the
dart game at a neighbor's house.
   The vote directed the commission staff to prepare a formal ban on
the darts for publication in the federal register on Nov. 4. If the
commission approves the final form of the ban then, it could order
it to take effect 30 days later.
   A safety standard for off-road vehicles, approved on a 2-1 vote,
prevents sale of the three-wheeled vehicles in this country.
   Four-wheeled versions, which have an accident rate half that of
the now-banned ATVs, still will be sold.
   Commissioner Anne Graham voted against the action, labeling it
inadequate.
   Both issues have attracted widespread attention in recent years
with reports of deaths and injuries, congressional hearings and
commission investigations into the dangers of the products.
   The action today on lawn darts was the latest step following a
decision announced in July regarding the darts, which have been
blamed for some deaths and an estimated 5,000 serious injuries to
children.
   Safety standards for all-terrain vehicles are the latest step in
a long and complex process which already has seen the banning of
future sales of three-wheeled ATVs.
   The standards under consideration would set rules for four-wheel
vehicles.
   ~whicles are small, one-rider machines that have become popular
for use on beaches, in woods and for other off-road activities.
There are more than 2.4 million of the vehicles in use in this
country and federal officials have blamed them for 1,000 deaths and
up to 300,000 injuries in recent years.
   Prolonged negotiations involving the Safety Commission, Justice
Department and several manufacturers resulted in a consent agreement
approved in April by a federal judge.
   The new safety standards, worked out with the manufacturers, are
a part of that agreement.
   More attention, in the last few months, has focused on lawn darts
_ long darts, usually metal tipped, which are used in a tossing game
similar to horseshoes.
   David Snow of Riverside, Calif., whose young daughter was killed
when one of the darts pierced her brain, has led the campaign to
drive the product from the marketplace.
   Federal regulations issued in the 1970s banned sales of the darts
to children and in toy stores, but they are still allowed to be sold
as sporting goods to adults.
   In many cases, however, the darts are included in game sets with
badminton racquets and volleyball nets, and often get into the hands
of children.
   Initially the safety commission had proposed to ban darts that
``have the potential for causing skull puncture injuries.''
   However, on Oct. 21 Congress, reportedly responding to a
broadcast news story on the danger, passed a bill calling on the
commission to ban lawn darts that can cause any puncture injury, not
just skull punctures.

   Grain and soybean futures opened modestly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid a lack of bullish news
beyond the Agriculture Department's expected announcement of a large
wheat sale to China.
   The sale to China of 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at
subsidized prices was rumored Thursday, as was a sale of U.S. corn
to Spain, so ``everything was already in the market,'' said Cathy
Leow, a grain and soybean market analyst with Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York.
   Planting conditions for corn and soybeans in South America have
improved markedly in the past week, putting pressure on U.S. prices
for those commodities, analysts said.
   And news that reduced domestic demand in Argentina has freed up
400,000 metric tons of corn for export added to the bearish tone in
the corn market.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.10{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1{ cents lower with December at $2.74 a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.31} a bushel;
soybeans were 2{ cents to 5{ cents lower with November at $7.56{ a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mixed in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .15 cent lower with December at
73.62 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .18 cent
higher with November at 81.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with December at 41.47 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .42 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
February at 48 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Thursday.

a tender offer in its previously announced $960 million cash and
stock bid for Chicago Pacific Corp.
   Maytag, itself the subject of takeover rumors, is offering to buy
up to 6.4 million shares, or about 49 percent of the outstanding
Chicago Pacific common stock, at $60 a share.
   The two companies announced an agreement to merge earlier this
week.
   If Maytag's tender offer is successful, and stockholders approve,
Chicago Pacific would become part of Maytag and each remaining share
of Chicago Pacific stock would be converted into Maytag shares. The
rate of exchange would be not more than one share of Chicago Pacific
for 2.7272 shares of Maytag and not less than 2.1429 Maytag shares.
   Among conditions on the offer is that at least 4 million Chicago
Pacific shares are tendered to Maytag and not withdrawn by the
midnight EST Nov. 28 expiration of the offer.
   Maytag, based in Newton, is a maker of home appliances and
vending equipment, and its principal appliance brands are Admiral,
Hardwick, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, Maytag and Norge.
   Chicago Pacific is best known for its Hoover vacuum cleaners and
floor care products.
   Last year, Maytag had sales of $1.8 billion, while Chicago
Pacific sales came to $1.1 billion.

   Old Dr. Frankenstein would think he died
and went to heaven if he could visit two small buildings in central
Texas: a leg here, an arm there, a shelf full of hearts and skulls
and skeletons by the dozen.
   But it's not something out a Halloween horror movie; it's the big
business of bones. Medical Plastics Laboratory Inc. says its
life-size reproductions of skeletons rake in millions of dollars.
   Thousands of the skeletons are used by doctors, hospitals and
medical schools around the world. The bones also have made their way
into rock music videos by the Grateful Dead and props for the
``Miami Vice'' TV series.
   ``There's really no one we can't sell to,'' Jerry Smith, director
of special projects, said recently. ``We have something for
everybody.''
   Medical Plastics is now in its fourth decade of taking a human
skeleton, making molds and duplicating it.
   Until 1985, real skeletons were imported from India. But that
source was lost when the Indian government, concerned about grave
robbing, halted such sales.
   ``Right now, there is a market simply because there are no longer
human bones available,'' said Joe Herndon, Medical Plastics'
national sales manager. ``So people have no choice. They have to buy
a plastic or reproduction of a skeleton. And we feel we produce the
one that has the greatest detail.''
   In the past two years, sales of skeletons and other Medical
Plastics products such as first-aid training mannequins have doubled
to $3 million, and should approach $5 million a year, Herndon said.
   The company, which employs 125 people, was started in 1949 by two
Gatesville physicians and a dentist who grew tired of waiting for
months and months to get a model of a skull.
   According to Herndon, the three were booted out of their homes by
their wives because the plastics they were experimenting with
smelled so bad. They finally produced their first skull in an old
chicken coop.
   The skull _ dubbed ``Yorick'' after the skull in ``Hamlet'' _ is
on display in a glass case in the company's office lobby.
   From skulls, the company evolved to full skeletons, organs and
training mannequins, which account for more than half the business,
according to Herndon.
   The mannequins, which are bought by the government and the armed
forces, are used to teach emergency workers and others how to treat
wounds, administer injections and perform cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.
   Some have names. Mr. Hurt, for example, sports a broken nose and
jaw and a skull fracture.
   The key to the company's skeletal success is that the facsimile
is so detailed it defies detection as artificial.
   Bones are made from a plastic that has the same consistency,
weight and color as real bones. They even react the same under
X-rays.
   ``It's got to be perfect,'' said Sheli Allen, one of several
people who assemble the skeletons. ``If it's not perfect, then it
won't look like a real body.''
   Depending on the amount of custom work, full-size skeletons range
in price from $995 to nearly $3,500. Less detailed models, intended
for elementary school use, start at $365.
   Despite all efforts, however, some bones _ particularly those
inside the skull and in the nasal cavity _ defy human attempts to
copy.
   ``Try as we may, we do our very best to approximate the skeleton,
but you just cannot duplicate Mother Nature,'' Herndon said.

<HEAD>Does Buyout Binge Serve the Public Interest?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A couple of decades ago, the head of one of the
nation's largest banks sought to assure the public about the surge
of high-yield loans being made to Third World and other nations.
   Great consternation was being expressed in various circles _
academe, the media, banking _ that the loans were overly risky and
might not be repaid. No fear, said the chairman, since most of these
loans were backed by governments.
   His goal was to impress on listeners the notion that any
government would do handstands to avoid default, since their credit
ratings, their interest costs and their very economic future would
be endangered.
   It didn't turn out that way, and the public paid for it, and
probably continues to do so, in the form of higher borrowing costs _
on credit cards, mortgages, business loans _ than can reasonably be
justified.
   Could something similar be occurring now in the allocation of
tens of billions of dollars to corporate takeovers? Like foreign
loans, these too provide big returns to lenders. Like foreign loans,
they could mean defaults.
   And, as it was with the foreign loans, there are fears being
expressed by sensible people that some of the loans aren't going to
be paid back on the terms agreed to in the contracts. Defaults?
Entirely possible.
   The level of concern was raised this week when Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan advised banks to examine different scenarios
that might have an impact on collections, such as recession or
periods of high inflation.
   In a recession, for example, a debt-burdened company might find
its repayments, already high by most standards, extremely difficult
to meet. What would it do? What would the bank be able to do?
   Inflation might pose an even more difficult situation, since most
loans these days rise with the general economic heat.
   High interest rates caused many business defaults in the 1970s,
and few real defenses against risk have been created since.
Moreover, recent history shows that high interest can be accompanied
by deep recession.
   Many companies that failed to survive previous bouts of inflation
and high interest were financially much healthier than some of
today's highly leveraged buyouts, which in the best of times might
fail if important assets _ an arm and a leg in human terms _ can't
be sold to meet payments.
   While the ideal and least damaging way to retire such debt is to
operate acquired companies more productively, that is, by reaching
higher levels of production efficiency, there is no assurance it can
be done.
   Instead, many of the companies will simply sell body parts to pay
bills, sometimes with seriously adverse impact on communities.
   Others will seek to retire debt by issuing stock _ becoming
public again _ just as they had retired the securities _ gone
private _ by taking on debt. Such activity might lessen credit
strains, but produce questionable shares.
   Even if companies bought out in highly leveraged deals continue
to carry their burden of debt there are implications for the general
public. Number one is that this debt burden tends to tie the hand of
the Federal Reserve.
   Since 1973, U.S. corporations have retired $270 billion in
equities while adding $600 billion in debt. In order to save
industry from disaster, the Fed might have to keep interest rates
low, thus risking a return of inflation.
   No matter what happens, the public is affected. Consider taxes.
Dividends are taxed, but debt not only is not, it brings a rebate
from Uncle Sam.
   There is one extremely beneficial effect. That benefit will come
if the companies now piling up debt manage to pay their bills by
operating more efficiently _ by producing goods and services at
increasingly lower costs.
   In that event, the companies and the entire economic community
would prosper through more jobs, greater job assurance, lower prices
and better wages, working conditions and goods.
   But, handled differently, the big debts of industry could mean
higher prices, poorer goods, higher interest rates, a poor quality
of stocks in which to invest and a superstructure of business that
would be vulnerable to spills.

<HEAD>Ralph Martino Will Have a Very Peculiar Resume</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Martino had a short career at AT&T. So
short, in fact, that the company was still announcing his arrival
the day after he quit.
   Setting a new standard for revolving-door employment, Martino
spent two days this week as the executive in charge of AT&T's
1,000-member computer sales force before returning to his old
employer, IBM.
   ``He started working Monday morning and he left Tuesday
afternoon,'' Dick Muldoon, a spokesman for American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., said Friday.
   ``We are absolutely assured that his decision was personal and it
was not because he was dissatisfied with business plans or
directions,'' Muldoon added.
   Martino, 38, served his brief stint as national sales vice
president at AT&T's Data Systems Group in Morristown, N.J.
   AT&T executives were still telling securities analysts about the
high-level appointment as late as Wednesday, not realizing their man
was gone, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
   International Business Machines Corp. said Martino is on special
assignment to David M. Thomas, president of the National
Distribution Division in Montvale, N.J. He worked previously in
IBM's Applications Systems Division in Valhalla, N.Y., overseeing
software development.
   ``All I know is he left and after one day he decided to return.
He does not want to be interviewed,'' IBM spokesman Douglas DeLay
said.
   AT&T's Muldoon added: ``He was very well respected _ at both
companies.''

<HEAD>Corporate Bond Market Still Stunned By Takeover Frenzy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The takeover fever on Wall Street has given some
parts of the corporate bond market a severe case of the chills.
   For most of the past week, trading of industrial bonds _ debt
securities issued mainly by the nation's bread-and-butter
manufacturing companies _ has been at a virtual standstill as
investors ponder the fallout from the recent spate of megadeals.
   These investors, which include many large pension funds or
insurance companies, are avoiding industrial bonds for fear the
companies that issue them _ despite their size _ might be future
takeover targets or aggressors, like RJR Nabisco Inc. or Kraft Inc.
And there are no buyers for the bonds investors currently own.
   ``Takeovers have been going on for several years, but what has
changed is ... that more companies seem to be targets and larger
companies thought of as immune to takeovers aren't. That's causing
quite a stir in the marketplace,'' noted Harold Goldberg, chairman
of the corporate rating committee of Moody's Investors Service.
   Two of the biggest buyouts in corporate history have been
proposed in the last two weeks. Philip Morris Cos. Inc. proposed an
$11.4 billion takeover of Kraft, which responded with a proposal for
a $13.6 billion restructuring of its own. The investment firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. made a record $20.3 billion offer for
RJR Nabisco after management proposed taking the company private in
a $17 billion leveraged buyout.
   Earlier in the month, Pillsbury Co. received a surprise $5.23
billion takeover offer from the British conglomerate Grand
Metropolitan PLC.
   What troubles bondholders is that these deals will be financed
primarily by borrowed money, first through private placement, such
as banks, and eventually through the public credit markets. That
will result in higher levels of debt than traditionaly have been
considered prudent and increase the likelihood that previous debt
may not be paid off.
   That especially worries Marshall Front, an economist at the
Chicago investment and mutual-fund management firm Stein Roe &
Farnham, who says the possibility of an economic recession would
further exacerbate the problem.
   Not surprisingly, the price of existing bonds of Philip Morris,
RJR Nabisco and Kraft have tumbled, falling as much as $200 per
$1,000 face amount. Prices of other industrial bonds also have taken
a beating, while yields, which move inversely, have shot up.
   ``The best way to characterize the market right now is that
everyone is pretty much in a holding pattern,'' explained James J.
Drury, a corporate bond analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. ``Nobody's ready to dive in the pool. People are just sticking
their toes in the water.''
   The hostile climate surrounding industrial bonds also has
discouraged corporations from bringing to market any further issues,
thereby forcing them to put off various projects and business plans,
or find cash elsewhere.
   ``What's on the bond calendar? There really isn't any calendar,''
said Drury.
   One big casualty this past week was a $1.15 billion offering of
Federated Department Stores Inc. Underwriters led by First Boston
Corp. decided to postpone the issue while they ``restructure the
transaction.''
   First Boston may have wished it did the same with a $300 million
issue of Eastman Kodak Co., which came to market about two weeks ago
and reportedly remains largely unsold.
   Concern about the surge in corporate takeovers has even carried
over into the Eurobond market, which trades debt securities issued
by U.S. and foreign companies outside their boundaries, analysts
said.
   They said the yields on some investment-grade corporate bonds had
been quoted in the Eurobond market as much as three percentage
points above U.S. Treasury bonds with comparable maturities, almost
the same spread as high-yield, low-rated ``junk'' bonds.
   Goldberg of Moody's said his company will ``add a measure of
conservatism in how we look at credits where we feel there is a
susceptibility to `event risk,''' a term Wall Street uses to
describe things like recapitalizations or LBOs.
   Both Moody's and Standard & Poor's Corp., another major
debt-rating service, already take these factors into consideration
and try to predict which companies could become takeover targets.
One giveaway is a high cash flow or underperforming stock.
   But Goldberg said, ``We'll be taking a harder look at anyone who
feels they might be subject to a special event.''
   Corporate bond analysts say the only way to revive interest in
the market is by giving bondholders more protection from event
risks, which traditionally have enriched shareholders.
   One way of doing that is by attaching agreements to bond issues
that protect bond investments from possible buyouts and ensure that
no corporate transaction could benefit shareholders at the expense
of bondholders.

<HEAD>Earnings Drop In 3rd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aetna Life & Casualty said Friday that its
third quarter earnings fell 7 percent, citing a decline in results
from personal, commercial property and group insurance.
   Aetna said it earned $235 million, or $2.07 a share, in the third
quarter compared with $254 million, or $2.21 a share, in the same
period in 1987.
   The company's operating earnings also fell, by 17 percent, to
$190 million from $231 million in 1987.
   Third-quarter revenue slipped 1.9 percent to $5.67 billion from
$5.78 billion.
   ``Personal and commercial-property results were down from last
year, along with group insurance results,'' said James T. Lynn,
Aetna chairman.
   For the first nine months, the company's net income was $503
million, or $4.40 a share, down 30 percent compared to $723 million,
or $6.24 a share, for the same period last year.
   Operating income in the same period was $471 million, down 26
percent compared to $639 million last year.
   Nine-month revenue rose 9.8 percent to $17.97 billion from $16.44
billion.
   Aetna, based in Hartford, said its assets as of Sept. 30 totalled
$77 billion, 5 percent more than last year.

   The stock market staged a mild rally today,
rebounding from Thursday's decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 24.35 on Thursday,
recovered 7.64 points to 2,148.47 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by 7 to 6 in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 707 up, 606 down and 571
unchanged.
   Thursday's drop hit hardest among stocks that were known or
rumored to be targets of takeovers and buyouts.
   The selling came as increasing numbers of analysts voiced concern
over the amounts of debt being built up in corporate America.
   But once having delivered that message, investors seemed willing
to look again today at individual deals that are likely to go
through, presenting the opportunity for trading profits.
   Also, analysts said the overall market got a lift from General
Motors, which issued a third quarter earnings report Thursday that
was much better than expected.
   GM shares, up 2~ on Thursday, climbed another 3[ to 83| on
turnover of more than 2.7 million shares today.
   Among big takeover targets, RJR Nabisco gained 2 to 84; Kraft was
up \ at 94}, and Pillsbury rose \ to 59[.
   Rollins Environmental led the active list, plunging 3[ to 10{.
The company reported earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended
Sept. 30 of 7 cents a share, down from 14 cents in the comparable
period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.33 to 156.50. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .68 at 301.32.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 105.77 million shares with two
hours to go.

<TEXT>
   West Point-Pepperell Inc., the textile
manufacturer facing a takeover bid from the owner of Fruit of the
Loom underwear, said Friday its profit rose 12 percent to a record
in its fourth fiscal quarter.
   Pepperell said it earned $24.3 million, or 83 cents a share, for
the quarter ended Sept. 24, up from $21.7 million, or 69 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter sales climbed 41 percent to $677 million from $481
million.
   For the fiscal year, Pepperell said its earnings rose 18 percent
to $84.4 million, or $2.82 per share, from $71.6 million, or $2.38 a
share, a year earlier.
   Sales for the fiscal year rose 26 percent to $2.15 billion from
$1.7 billion for the previous year.
   The earnings figures include results from J.P. Stevens & Co.
Inc., which Pepperell acquired in May for $1.2 billion.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer J.L. Lanier Jr. said he
expects significant economies in the future from the bed and bath
products operations of Pepperell and Stevens. ``Barring a major
economic downturn, fiscal 1989 should be another good year,'' he
said.
   Chicago-based Farley Inc., owner of Fruit of the Loom, announced
this week a $1.4 billion takeover bid for Pepperell.
   Pepperell advised its stockholders not to take action until
receiving the company's recommendation.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by the late-surging
soybean market. Corn finished substantially higher while wheat
futures were mixed.
   With no news to move the markets following an opening dip,
traders responded to technical signals from price charts that
indicated the soybean and corn markets were oversold and due for a
correction, said Cathy Leow, grain and soybean market analyst with
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``It looks like a huge, technically inspired rally,'' she said.
``The markets have been down pretty hard the last couple of weeks.
Today, we gapped lower at the opening but there was no
follow-through selling. Then toward the end of the day, people
started covering up (that is, buying to offset positions established
earlier in the day) and it just accelerated.''
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 2 cents lower with the contract

<HEAD>British Steel Expects 31 Percent Rise in Pre-Tax Profit This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The British government expects to announce on Nov.
23 the price of the shares it will be offering in its sale of stock
in state-owned British Steel PLC, it was announced Friday.
   Britain's largest steelmaker also announcved it expects to post a
pre-tax profit gain of at least 31 percent in its current fiscal
year.
   In a preliminary prospectus for the planned privatization, it
said it expects to report pre-tax profit of at least 550 million
pounds, or $968 million, for the year ending April 1, 1989 compared
with 419 million pounds, or $737 million, in the previous 12 months.
   Regarding the stock offering, the steelmaker said about one-third
of the 2 billion shares to be offered will be sold to foreign
investors in the United States, Japan, continental Europe and
Canada. The remaining shares will be sold to institutional and
individual investors in Britain, it said.
   The British government plans to close the offering Dec. 2 and
trading in the shares is expected to begin by Dec. 5.
   ``This sale demonstrates again the government's determination to
continue to extend the number of industries experiencing the
benefits of privatization,'' Trade Secretary Lord Young told a news
conference.
   The British Steel sell-off will be the first privatization since
the government's sale of its remaining one-third stake in British
Petroleum Co. PLC. That sale coincided with the October 1987 stock
market crash, and was a flop with investors.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government
successfully has sold off billions of dollars' worth of state assets
since 1979 to promote capitalism and encourage stock ownership in
Britain. British Airways PLC, Jaguar PLC and British Gas PLC are
just some of the other state-owned companies sold to the public.

<HEAD>Investors Hit the Wall at the $20 Billion Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the crest of the new megamerger wave, Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts & Co.'s $20.3 billion bid for RJR Nabisco Inc. was
greeted with heady confidence.
   Like the four-minute mile, a one-time barrier that has been left
in the dust by a generation of faster runners, the $20 billion mark
appeared to be a stepping stone on the path to even bigger deals.
   But in the wake of tough questions about the financing of these
transactions, the new benchmark is looking more like Bob Beamon's
1968 long jump _ an elusive record that may not be broken for years
to come.
   Some attributed Beamon's astounding jump, which remains one of
the oldest records in track and field, to the rarified air of Mexico
City. The environment on Wall Street seemed similarly primed a few
weeks ago, when the first of more than $40 billion in new takeovers,
buyouts and restructurings was announced.
   ``The acquisition business seemed to have mushroomed to some sort
of emotional and financial extreme,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice
president at First Albany Corp.
   The succession of deal announcements came at rapid-fire pace:
Grand Metropolitan PLC surprised Pillsbury Co. with a $5.2 billion
bid; Philip Morris Cos. Inc. offered $11 billion for Kraft Inc.;
Kraft responded with a $13.6 billion restructuring; RJR Nabisco
managers said they were considering going private in a $17 billion
deal; Kohlberg Kravis countered with its unprecedented tender offer;
Farley Inc. bid $1.4 billion for textile giant West Point-Pepperell
Inc., among others.
   ``Not only did we get a lot of deals, but they were big deals,''
Johnson said. Yet when investors and observers started focusing on
the business ramifications of these huge transactions, ``everybody
came away with an uncomfortable feeling,'' he added.
   Indeed, ``some of the bigger deals are being looked at more
carefully and critically,'' said Joseph Bartlett, a partner in the
law firm Gaston & Snow who served as undersecretary of commerce in
the Johnson administration.
   Adding to concerns about the high _ and potentially dangerous _
levels of debt needed to support these buyouts, were words of
warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who cautioned
banks to exercise discretion in granting loans to dealmakers for
fear a recession could turn megadeals into megadefaults.
   Further, the delay of the sale of $1.15 billion in junk bonds
needed to finance Campeau Corp.'s huge takeover of Federated
Department Stores Inc. served as an indication that ``this is not a
perpetual-motion machine,'' Bartlett said.
   If Canadian investor Robert Campeau ``has bitten off more than he
can chew, maybe these deals are not so easy to do,'' he added.
   It was not long before investors began to focus on the darker
side of the takeover scene. They began to realize that even if some
of the deals could be pulled off, the resulting companies would be
awash in debt.
   ``The dependence on debt has ... led us to recognize the warning
that this might not be healthy for corporate America,'' Johnson
said, pointing to the fact that while Nabisco stock initially rose
on the takeover talk, the price of its bonds plunged.
   Later in the week, mounting fears sent the prices of takeover
stocks sharply lower, and the stocks of companies rumored to be
potential buyout targets fell in tandem. Several issues recovered
some of the lost ground on Friday.
   The crisis will come if buyers don't materialize for the
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds used to finance the deals or if the
leveraged companies are unable to sell off some unneeded assets to
pay down their debts.
   Among those immediately affected would be banks, particularly
those that made what they thought were short-term loans to tide the
companies over until bonds or assets could be sold.
   No one knows what exactly triggered the feeding frenzy in the
first place. But Bartlett suspects the upcoming election is playing
at least a supporting role.
   ``There's a shiver in the market ... that either Bush or Dukakis,
once in office, will tighten up on the regulation of the securities
markets and make (takeovers) more difficult from a tax standpoint,''
he said, referring to the outcome of the presidential election.
   Bartlett noted that the government essentially finances more than
a third of the cost of leveraged buyouts by allowing interest
deductions on the debt. That's a loophole he said would be easy to
close.
   ``You could say if a company is too highly leveraged, then only
half the interest is deductible,'' for example.
   Many argue that the participants in these deals _ from those who
reap huge fees issuing junk bonds or loans to those who purchase the
debt _ are ultra-savvy investors who know what they're getting into.
That doesn't lessen the risks, however.
   Johnson thinks recent events will prove to be a watershed for the
buyout business. Not only does he think takeover activity will
subside as investors continue to focus on the financial fragility of
these deals, but he called $20 billion ``a benchmark that won't be
broken for some time.''

Inc., announcing it had withdrawn its $210 million offer for the
Mobile, Ala.-based supermarket chain.
   _Stephen Wang, 24, was sentenced to three years in prison for his
role in the nation's second-largest insider trading fraud behind the
Ivan Boesky scandal.
   _The Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined John
Morrell & Co. $4.33 million, the largest fine ever against a single
employer, for what the agency said were hundreds of ``willful safety
and health violations'' at the meatpacker's Sioux Falls, S.D., plant.
   _General Motors Corp. reported an industry earnings record of
$859.2 million for the third quarter, while Chrysler Corp. said its
earnings dropped 54.3 percent to $112.5 million. Ford Motor Co. was
just short of GM's record at $856.3 million.
   _Major oil companies including Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Texaco
Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. reported hefty gains in earnings for
the third quarter on the strength of higher profit margins in
refining and marketing.
   _The government said the U.S. economy expanded at a modest 2.2
percent annual rate during the summer, the slowest pace in almost
two years. Other economic reports showed orders for ``big-ticket''
durable goods plunged 4.1 percent, personal income rose a modest 0.5
percent, consumer spending was unchanged and sales of existing homes
fell 2.2 percent in September.
   _A Labor Department showed prices Americans pay for imported
goods fell 1.1 percent from July through September, the first
decline in more than two years. The drop was attributed to the fall
in crude oil prices and a rise in the value of the dollar.
   _The Labor Department said wages have risen an average 3.9
percent over the last 12 months, but private employer costs for
benefits have soared 6.7 percent largely on increases in Social
Security taxes. Another Labor report showed first-year base wage

   The Reagan administration said today that the
federal budget deficit was $155.1 billion in the just-completed
budget year, up 3.6 percent from fiscal 1987.
   The administration's final accounting for the budget year which
ended Sept. 30. showed that the imbalance between revenues and
spending rose $5.4 billion from last year, when it was $149.7
billion.
   The Office of Management and Budget previously reported the 1987
deficit at $150.4 billion, but with the release of today's report,
refigured it at $149.7 billion.
   The budget gap was still well below the all-time record of $221.1
billion set in the 1986 fiscal year.
   Red ink for the year exceeded both the initial administration
projection of $146.7 billion, issued in February, and the updated
estimate of $152.3 billion, released in July. It hit the
Congressional Budget Office projection of $155 billion nearly
exactly.
   In a joint statement, the Treasury Department and the White
House's Office of Management and Budget attributed $3 billion of the
overrun to spending by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the agency
that rescues insolvent savings institutions. It spent $8.1 billion
in 1988, $3 billion more than expected at mid-summer.
   The agency, in a spate of activity from mid-August through the
end of September, pledged more than $16 billion to rescue 60 S&Ls.
However, much of the spending doesn't show up on the budget.
   The federal government spent a record $1.064 trillion during the
12-month period, up 6 percent from 1987. Receipts were $909 billion,
up 6.4 percent from a year ago.
   The administration is predicting a budget deficit for the current
1989 fiscal year of $145.5 billion, but most private analysts expect
even less progress.
   The flood of government red ink has been blamed for the nation's
chronic trade imbalance, for holding interest rates above historic
averages and for helping to trigger last year's stock market crash.
   President Reagan and congressional leaders struck a budget pact
last winter, after the crash, that has held the deficit almost to
last year's level. But, economists say there won't be additional
shrinkage without painful budget cuts or a tax increase.
   A blue ribbon, bipartisan commission has been meeting this summer
and, after the election, will offer the new president its
recommendations. However, Republican George Bush has promised to
reject the recommendation if it includes a tax increase. Democrat
Michael Dukakis has promised to consider the recommendations, but
has proposed no tax increases and few spending cuts.

<HEAD>Coniston Outlines Plans For TW Acquisition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners, which launched a tender offer
to acquire food service giant TW Services Inc., said Friday it would
sell off the company's small health services operations if the deal
is successful.
   The aggressive investment firm also said Citibank has agreed to
provide $750 million to finance what would be a $1.14 billion
acquisition.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Coniston
said it would sell American Medical Services, a Milwaukee-based
company that operates 27 skilled-nursing facilities and two
retirement living centers in Wisconsin, California, Colorado and
Illinois.
   The operation, which employs about 4,100 people, reported revenue
of $100 million last year. It is a very small part of TW's overall
operations, which include the Denny's and Hardee's restaurant chains.
   Coniston principal Paul E. Tierney Jr. said the partners paid a
$5 million fee in order to secure Citibank's participation as
primary lender in the deal.
   While most acquirers try to postpone paying fees until a deal is
closer to completion, Tierney said Coniston ``did not want anyone to
think this deal couldn't be financed.''
   He also said the agreement with Citibank indicates ``that this is
clearly different from other instances where we haven't tried to buy
a company'' but instead promoted its restructuring.
   Coniston, which was snubbed earlier this month by TW, began a
$29-a-share tender offer Friday.
   The cash tender offer for 15.75 million shares, amounting to
about $456.75 million, if successful would give it a majority stake
in TW, which on Oct. 12 rejected the group's proposal for a $28 a
share buyout.
   The group, which already owns about 19 percent of TW's 48.5
million common shares outstanding, intends to acquire the remaining
shares of TW in a subsequent merger for $29 a share, giving the
entire buyout an indicated value of about $1.14 billion.

   Share prices rose Friday in a lackluster session on

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 6.3
points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,858.4.
   Volume was 482.7 million shares, compared with the 593.5 million

   Dealers said the market appeared to be resting after a fitful
week of watching and waiting for an array of economic indicators.
   However, market analysts contended that the underlying tone of
the market remained firm after Thursday's surprise narrowing of the
British current account deficit to 560 million pounds, or $989

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Posts Earnings Increase For Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Thursday increased
business in transport aircraft, space systems and missiles
contributed to a 4 percent increase in its third-quarter earnings.
   Earnings for the quarter were $83.5 million, or $2.18 per share,
companred with $80.3 million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 15.2 percent to $3.72 billion from
$3.23 billion for the same period last year.
   Third quarter revenues were sharply higher in the transport
aircraft segment as a result of increased MD-80 and DC-10@KC-10
deliveries and growth in the C-17 program. Revenues were up sharply
in space systems and missiles, up slightly in combat aircraft and in
information systems.
   Combat aircraft earnings in this year's third quarter were
approximately equal to those of a year earlier despite rising
expenditures for development work connected with the U.S. Air
Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter competition, the company said.
   The company said its losses in information systems were about the
same as last year when non-recurring items were excluded.
   The company said its earnings for the first nine months slipped
7.3 percent to $205.1 million, or $5.34 per share, compared with
$220.4 million or $5.43 per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 6.1 percent to $10.4 billion from $9.8
billion last year.
   Disposition of the corporation's interest in a health maintenance
organization contributed a pre-tax gain of $26 million, or 43 cents
per share after tax, to information systems results in the third
quarter. However, the gain was fully offset by costs of a
restructuring program that involved work force reductions and
write-offs of certain assets and excess facilities.
   In the third quarter of 1987, information systems results
included a pre-tax gain of $15 million, or 21 cents per share after
tax, from the sale of the corporation's holdings in a computer
services company.

<HEAD>Platinum Revealing Third Face As Investment Metal</HEAD>

   Platinum, valued most highly as a jewelry metal in Japan and as
an industrial metal elsewhere, is developing a third personality as
an investment metal thanks to a threat of tight supplies and a new
crop of platinum coins.
   Actually, an appreciable small-investment market for the white
metal has existed since 1982, when platinum bars and coins weighing
10 troy ounces or less became available.
   But the recent releases of the one-ounce Australian Koala and
Chinese Panda coins and the one-ounce platinum Dragon medallion from
British refiner Johnson Matthey PLC have expanded the choices for
small investors.
   Canada is expected to launch a one-ounce platinum Maple Leaf coin
in the near future, which is likely to attract a good many North
American buyers, experts say.
   ``We expect the market for platinum as an investment metal to
become as regular a feature as that for gold or silver,'' Johnson
Matthey, the world's largest platinum refiner, said recently in its
annual platinum market review and forecast.
   According to the firm's figures, small investment demand for
platinum last year in the non-Soviet world amounted to 215,000 troy
ounces, down sharply from 450,000 ounces in 1986 but still a large
amount compared with the 45,000 ounces purchased by small investors
in 1982. The small-investor segment accounted for 15 percent of
platinum demand in 1987.
   Analysts linked last year's buying slump to profit-taking by
investors following platinum's 38 percent rise in value during 1986,
when the price for spot delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange
rose from about $340 to $470 an ounce.
   Platinum's value has continued to rise, albeit more slowly,
gaining 5 percent during 1987 and nearly 10 percent so far this
year. Platinum for January delivery on the New York Merc closed
Friday at $543.80 a troy ounce.
   Most experts recently have turned more bullish on platinum based
on Johnson Matthey's forecast for a 450,000-ounce supply shortfall
this year and continued supply tightness through 1992.
   Johnson Matthey predicted an increase in small investment demand
for platinum this year, due to both the bullish supply-demand
picture and the new coins.
   GoldCorp Australia, which launched its Koala coin on Sept. 22,
had hoped the Koala would make a big splash in Japan, where the
yen's strength against the dollar has made highly prized platinum
jewelry more affordable (platinum is denominated in U.S. dollars on
the world market).
   Instead, the Koala has met with its greatest early success in the
United States, said Stephen M. Gotwald, a vice president of GoldCorp
Australia and general manager of its North American operations.
   ``We had an objective of 100,000 ounces in North American
sales,'' he said. ``If I said I was pleasantly surprised, that would
not express my sheer joy at how well this coin has done. If I said
150 percent of my initial expectations I would not be overstating
it.''
   Platinum as an investment is a more accepted notion in North
America than in Japan. According to Johnson Matthey's statistics,
investment buying accounted for more than 9 percent of North
American demand last year while in Japan it accounted for less than
4 percent.
   One reason for the relatively weak Japanese investment interest
in platinum may be the popularly held Japanese belief that platinum
is the best of all possible jewelry metals.
   ``Platinum is perceived as the ultimate metal for jewelry,'' said
Sadako Fujikawa, the Tokyo representative for Platinum Guild
International, a U.S.-based marketing asssociation.
   ``Platinum is not ostentatious,'' she said. ``The Japanese
esthetic value is tranquil, quiet, subdued, so something that is not
ostentatious is a virtue.''
   She said gold jewelry was perceived by the Japanese as showy and
glitzy, so they tend to think of gold as more of an investment metal.
   ``Gold's investment value is understood but as a jewelry metal,
platinum is seen as being more valuable.''
   While jewelry-making totaled more than half of Japan's platinum
use last year, jewelry accounted for less 2 percent of platinum
demand in North America in 1987.
   Industrial use _ especially as a component in automobile
pollution-control systems _ accounted for nearly 82 percent of North
American platinum demand last year, according to Johnson Matthey.

   The stock market bounced back from Thursday's
drop to post a moderate gain today.
   Thursday's decline hit hardest among stocks that were known or
rumored to be targets of takeovers and buyouts.
   The selling came as increasing numbers of analysts voiced concern
over the amounts of debt being built up in corporate America.
   But once having delivered that message, investors seemed willing
to look again today at individual deals that are likely to go
through, presenting the opportunity for trading profits.
   Also, analysts said the overall market got a lift from General
Motors, which issued a third quarter earnings report Thursday that
was much better than expected.

<HEAD>Drexel Bond Financier Says Probe Taking Personal Toll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.'s high-yield bond chief who's at the center of a federal
insider-trading probe, says the ordeal of the nearly 2-year-old
investigation has taken a personal toll.
   ``The last 20 months have been very painful. The strain has been
enormous,'' Milken said in a rare interview, published Friday in The
Trentonian newspaper. ``Am I operating at my fullest capacity? No.
Will my life be shorter? Possibly. I don't know how many more
wrinkles there are on my heart.''
   The Trentonian is owned by Ingersoll Publications Co., whose
chief executive Ralph Ingersoll is a personal friend of Milken's and
a Drexel client.
   Ingersoll has been an outspoken defender of Milken and has
accused the government of creating a witch-hunt atmosphere against
the wealthy 42-year-old investment banker, who is considered a
pioneer in the $100 billion market for high-yield, non-investment
grade securities commonly called junk bonds.
   Drexel, Milken and three other key employees were accused by the
Securities and Exchange Commission of insider trading, stock
manipulation and other civil fraud charges Sept. 7, after a long
investigation by the enforcement agency stemming from disclosures
from now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky.
   More serious criminal charges have been expected since federal
prosecutors notified the firm earlier this month that it was the
target of a grand jury investigation. The defendants have denied any
wrongdoing.
   Milken declined to discuss the accusations against him in the
interview, but instead stressed what he called his deep affection
for his family and extensive philanthropic activities. He downplayed
the importance he has placed on his high-flung career.
   Professional milestones, he said, pale in significance to a son's
problems with seizures and his father's bout with cancer.
   ``My first bond issue?'' he asked. ``It was less satisfying than
finding out what was wrong with Greg, less satisfying than learning
(his son) Lance was chosen valedictorian.''
   A dream day, he added, ``would begin with my wife calling me to
says she's pregnant.''
   A native Californian who parlayed Drexel to the forefront of
high-yield bond underwriting, Milken is known for working 12-hour
days, seven days a week. He reportedly makes $40 million a year.
   His wife _ a high school sweetheart whom Milken married at 22 _
remains fiercely proud and defensive of him.
   ``I've told (the children), `Your father is a genius and has
revolutionized the finance industry,''' Lori Milken said in the
Ingersoll interview.
   ```People don't like change, and they're trying to get rid of
your father, and if you look in your history books, you'll see that
people who have tried to make change have had this happen.'''
   Whatever his fondness for family, Milken denied wishing he could
go back and pursue a lower-profile career.
   ``Leave no mark in the sand?'' he asked. ``No, I haven't reached
that point yet.''

<TEXT>
   The American Telephone & Telegraph Co. on
Friday won a spirited competition to provide thousands of new
computers to the Defense Department, establishing its position in
the industry for years to come with what has been described as the
computer contract of the century.
   The contract awarded Friday was worth $929.1 million.
   AT&T officials said its value could ultimately exceed $1 billion,
depending on the options exercised.
   The Air Force, which acted as the agent for the other services in
overseeing the bidding, said an AT&T subsidiary, AT&T Technologies
Inc., had been selected over five competitors and would now be
expected to deliver some 20,000 mini-computers over the next five
years.
   Among the losers were the Zenith Data Systems Corp.; the Lockheed
Missiles & Space Co.; the Planning Research Corp.; Honeywell Federal
Systems, and International Business Machines Corp.
   Air Force leaders hailed the results of the competition, saying
the Pentagon had pushed the industry into a new round of
price-cutting.
   ``We are going to completely rewrite the industry's cost formulas
for equipment of this type with this contract,'' said Andrew E.
Bilinski, a deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force for
acquisition.
   The Air Force and Pentagon had originally estimated it would cost
up to $4.5 billion to acquire 20,000 of the machines.
   The Air Force is buying the computers for its own use as well as
that of the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Defense Communications Agency
and Defense Logistics Agency. From the start, the contract was
recognized as being so large that it could ensure the winner a
strong position in the highly competitive industry for years to come.
   AT&T, although a relative newcomer to the computer ranks thanks
to the 1984 breakup of the Bell System, had widely been considered a
front-runner in the competition.
   That was because the Air Force, in a bid to standardize what is
now a maze of computer systems throughout the Defense Department,
specified that all bidders must propose computers that could operate
on UNIX _ a computer software program developed by AT&T.
   The UNIX system, although owned by AT&T, is now widely licensed
to other vendors and can be used to operate many different
computers. The Air Force's decision, however, prompted a legal
challenge that delayed the award for almost a year and ultimately
ended with two industry giants _ the Digital Equipment Corp. and
Wang Laboratories _ withdrawing from the competition.
   Digital and Wang charged, unsuccessfully, the Air Force had
rigged the competition with the decision to specify UNIX
compatibility.
   AT&T was allowed to enter unregulated markets like computer
manufacturing thanks to its 1984 settlement of an antitrust suit
filed by the Justice Department. By agreeing to spin off its 23
local Bell System companies, AT&T was granted the freedom to pursue
virtually any business lines it wanted.
   Herb Linnen, an AT&T spokesman in Washington, hailed Friday's
award, describing it as the ``largest computer contract ever awarded
by the federal government.''
   Linnen said the contract ``has a potential value in excess of $1
billion, depending upon the options exercised.''
   ``Winning this contract firmly establishes AT&T as a leader in
the federal computer marketplace,'' added Warren G. Corgan, the vice
president of AT&T's Federal Systems Division.
   ``This project is a very large systems integration undertaking,
an assignment that plays to AT&T's strength,'' he added.
   Robert M. Kavner, the president of AT&T's Data Systems Group,
said the contract also was the largest AT&T had won since it entered
the computer business commercially four years ago.
   ``It is a great shot in the arm for our data systems business,''
he said.
   The Air Force, in announcing the award, said AT&T would perform
most of the work in Greensboro, N.C., and Oklahoma City, Okla. It
said 363 bids were solicited and six proposals were received.

broad losses with a modest rally in slackened trading Friday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 24.35 on Thursday,
rose 9.06 to 2,149.89. That left the average with a net loss for the
week of 33.61 points.
   Big Board volume totaled 146.30 million shares, against 196.54
million in the previous session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
858 up, 595 down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.30 million
shares, down from 196.54 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 173.07 million shares.
   Thursday's decline hit hardest among stocks that were known or
rumored to be targets of takeovers and buyouts.
   The selling came as increasing numbers of analysts voiced concern
over the amounts of debt being built up in corporate America.
   But once having delivered that message, investors seemed willing
to look again today at individual deals that are likely to go
through, presenting the opportunity for trading profits.
   Also, analysts said the overall market got a lift from General
Motors, which issued a third quarter earnings report Thursday that
was much better than expected.
   GM shares, up 2~ on Thursday, climbed another 3] to 83~ on
turnover of more than 3.6 million shares Friday.
   Among big takeover targets, RJR Nabisco gained 3 to 85; Kraft was
up 2 at 96{, and Pillsbury rose | to 59{.
   The investment firm of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., a bidder
for RJR Nabisco, said its plan does not call for the sale of large
parts of the company and its financing is not conditioned on such
sales.
   Rollins Environmental led the active list, tumbling 2} to 10~.
The company reported earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended
Sept. 30 of 7 cents a share, down from 14 cents in the comparable
period a year earlier.
   Teledyne rose 10[ to 333}. The company said directors authorized
it to buy back as many as 1 million of the approximately 11.4
million shares it has outstanding.
   Coastamerica, which agreed to be acquired by American Hoist &
Derrick for $10.50 a share, jumped 1{ to 10[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $10.83 billion, or 0.40
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.62 to 156.79.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.49 to 320.67, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.25 at 278.53.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
1.02 to 382.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 301.75, up 1.11.

   October 1988 has been no prize-winning month for
the stock market. But, considering the historical alternatives, many
investors will take it without much complaint.
   With one session left on Monday before the month ends, stock
market averages show some modest gains since the end of September.
   Stocks got through the first anniversary of Black Monday on Oct.
19 relatively unscathed. Indeed, two days later several market
indicators reached their highest levels since the crash.
   If there is a sense of relief on Wall Street as the month draws
to a close, however, there is very little elation.
   The market's rally since late summer has failed to impress many
analysts, who note that it has done little to lift the prices of the
many small- to medium-size issues known as ``secondary'' stocks.
   Business remains bad in many areas of the securities industry, as
witness the planned layoffs of about 1,000 employees announced by
Shearson Lehman Hutton a few days ago.
   On top of all that, many analysts worry that what activity has
occurred in the market lately is dangerously speculative, based as
it is on a frenzy of takeover deals and rumors.
   In the view of a good many observers, both the buyout specialists
who acquire stocks with borrowed money and the traders who follow in
their wake are engaged in the kind of activity that often comes at
market peaks.
   ``One of the mesmerizing ingredients of market tops is the latest
fad,'' said Justin Mamis, an analyst at Cowen & Co.
   ``Fads, whether they be toys or hot tips or tulip bulbs, provide
excitement, motivation to buy and a justification for paying a lot
of money for something you hadn't realized was so desirable before.
   ``The bidding wars culminate in top-of-the-market prices, meaning
someone eventually will wind up a loser because that's the nature of
markets.''
   Warnings of that sort have struck home lately, prompting a
selling squall in the stocks of many companies involved in takeover
deals and rumors.
   With a 33.61-point decline to 2,149.89 in the past week, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials clings to a net gain of 36.98 points
for October to date.
   Other readings for the week showed the New York Stock Exchange
composite index down 2.63 at 156.79; the NASDAQ composite index for
the over-the-counter market down 5.80 at 382.79, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index down 4.32 at 301.75.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 170.03 million shares a day,
against 170.63 million the week before.
   Market-watchers say it would be simplistic to argue that
takeovers and buyouts have been the only prop under the stock market
this year.
   ``Stocks have risen for other reasons, like strong earnings,
dividend increases and continued economic growth,'' said John
Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Indeed, General Motors shares were a conspicuous gainer in the
past week, rising against the tide of takeover jitters on the
strength of a much better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.
   Still, observed Connolly, ``we wonder what would have happened to
the market had not $150 billion in equities been retired through
merger and acquisition.
   ``Some of this money has obviously been recycled and has helped
the stock prices of lots of companies not even remotely involved.''

   The dollar fell Friday in thin trading that was
dominated by rumors and continued bearish sentiment toward the U.S.
currency.
   Gold prices rose following false rumors that Syria had invaded
parts of Lebanon it does not already control. Republic National Bank
of New York said gold bullion was bid at $412.25 an ounce as of 4
p.m. EDT, up from $407.50 late Thursday.
   Tension in the Middle East drives investors toward gold as a safe
haven.
   The Syrian rumor pushed the dollar higher as well, but only
temporarily.
   Hurting the dollar was an announcement in West Germany of a small
tax break to West German citizens who own government bonds, said
Peter van der Mespel, corporate foreign exchange chief for Deutsche
Genossenschaftsbank in New York.
   The dollar fell against the West German mark, and that led to a
general decline for the currency, van der Mespel said.
   ``The market is still very bearish toward the dollar,'' said
Stephen Dakin, foreign exchange trading manager for Union Bank of
Switzerland in New York.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.18 Japanese yen to a closing 126.08 yen. Later in
London, it fell to 125.75 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to
125.63 yen from 126.08 Thursday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7680 from $1.7695 late
Thursday. Later in New York, the pound rose to $1.7720 from $1.7675
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.7719 West German marks, down from
1.7783; 1.4938 Swiss francs, down from 1.4982; 1.2038 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2050; 6.0525 French francs, down from 6.0680;
and 1,319.25 Italian lire, down from 1,323.12.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.7755 West German marks, up from 1.7725; 1.4970
Swiss francs, up from 1.4915; 6.0750 French francs, up from 6.0455;
2.0010 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9977; 1,321.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,320.00; and 1.2035 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2024.
   In Hong Kong, gold bullion rose 65 cents to close at a bid
$409.87 a troy ounce. Later in Europe, the Mideast rumors drove gold
up. In London, gold bullion rose to $410.50 an ounce from $407.50
Thursday. In Zurich, it rose to $411.25 an ounce from $407.20.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $412.40 a troy ounce from $407.60.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.31 a troy
ounce from $6.21 bid late Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery rose to $6.289 a troy ounce from $6.200.

   The federal budget deficit, after dramatically
improving last year, grew in fiscal 1988 to $155.1 billion, the
Reagan administration reported Friday.
   The administration's final accounting for the budget year that
ended Sept. 30 showed that the imbalance between revenues and
spending rose $5.4 billion, or 3.6 percent, from the previous year's
$149.7 billion deficit.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a joint statement
with the White House Office of Management and Budget, said ``the
underlying trend in the deficit ... remains downward.''
   The 1988 budget gap was still well below the all-time record of
$221.1 billion set in the 1986 fiscal year.
   Brady said special factors such as the phase-in of the new tax
law in 1987, the sale of the federally owned Conrail freight
railroad and a one-day shift of military pay from 1987 into 1988
either shrank the 1987 deficit or inflated the 1988 gap.
   Excluding the one-time factors, the deficit would have fallen by
$31.1 billion between 1987 and 1988, he said.
   Red ink for the year exceeded both the initial administration
projection of $146.7 billion issued in February and the updated
estimate of $152.3 billion released in July. It hit the
Congressional Budget Office projection of $155 billion nearly
exactly.
   However, the deficit was well below initial projections of
private economists who feared last year that the October stock
market crash would slow economic growth, cutting into tax
collections and producing a deficit as high as $185 billion.
   The administration said its mid-summer projection was off because
it underestimated spending by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the
agency that rescues insolvent savings institutions. The board spent
$8.1 billion in fiscal 1988, $3 billion more than expected.
   The board, in a spate of activity from mid-August through the end
of September, rescued more than 60 savings and loans. However, much
of the spending doesn't show up on the budget immediately and
analysts say assistance to the ailing S&L industry could contribute
$15 billion a year to the deficit over the next three years.
   There have now been deficits in 27 of the past 28 years, running
up a total accumulated national debt of $2.61 trillion. The last
year the United States had a budget surplus was 1969, when
government revenues exceeded spending by $3.2 billion.
   The administration is predicting it will whittle down the budget
deficit for the current fiscal year to $145.5 billion, but most
private analysts expect less progress.
   The flood of government red ink has been blamed for the nation's
chronic trade imbalance, for holding interest rates above historic
averages and for helping to trigger last year's stock market crash.
   President Reagan and congressional leaders last winter struck a
budget pact after the crash that has held the deficit almost to the
1987 level. But economists say there won't be additional shrinkage
without painful spending cuts or a tax increase.
   Analysts also expect the Federal Reserve Board to fight inflation
by nudging up interest rates to slow the economy. Higher interest
rates will add to the escalating cost of financing the accumulated
national debt, while slower growth will cut into tax revenue.
   A bipartisan commission on the deficit has been meeting since
summer and after the Nov. 8 election will offer the new president
its recommendations.
   However, Republican nominee George Bush has promised to reject
the recommendation if it includes a tax increase. Democrat Michael
Dukakis, while promising to consider the report, so far has proposed
no tax increases and few spending cuts.
   The federal government spent a record $1.064 trillion during
fiscal 1988, up 6 percent from 1987. Receipts were $909 billion, up
6.4 percent from a year earlier.
   The largest spending categories were the military, followed by
Social Security, interest on the national debt and other programs in
the Department of Health and Human Services.
   Military spending totaled $281.9 billion in 1988, up 2.9 percent
from the same period a year earlier. Spending for Social Security
totaled $214.2 billion, up 5.8 percent. Interest on the national
debt was a record $214.1 billion, up 9.6 percent.
   The other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, spent
$159.0 billion in 1988, up 6.7 percent.

   General Motors Corp.'s report of record
third-quarter earnings has left auto analysts split over whether the
automaker is headed back to significant profitability.
   GM, the world's largest indutrial corporation, reported Thursday
that it earned $859.2 million during the July-to-September period.
   Analyst Wendy Beale of Smith Barney Inc. said Friday that she
felt the results indicated GM was on the way back.
   ``The cost-cutting was there in the second quarter and most
people ignored it,'' she said. ``It was there in the third quarter,
too.''
   But analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns & Co. was skeptical.
   ``About 99 percent of the analysts can delineate the turnaround
story,'' he said. ``I'm in the `don't' camp.''
   The size of GM's profit for the third quarter, which amounted to
$2.40 a share, surprised many analysts, some of whom were predicting
earnings of a dollar a share less.
   If a one-time accounting change GM exercised in the third quarter
of 1987 is taken into account, the company's profit for the quarter
doubled over the July-September period last year. If it isn't taken
into account, GM's earnings increased 5.8 percent.
   The profit also broke a four-quarter streak in which Ford Motor
Co. outearned the much-larger GM. On Wednesday, Ford reported a
$856.3 million third-quarter profit, an industry record that held
for one day.
   GM said its earnings came on healthy North American sales, strong
overseas performance and a cost-cutting program that was beginning
to take hold.
   ``We are seeing increasingly strong bottom-line benefits of the
reindustrialization undertaken by GM in the 1980s ...'' GM Chairman
Roger B. Smith and President Robert Stempel said in a joint
statement Thursday. ``It's clear that our year-to-year earnings
improvement is the result of the efforts of the entire GM team to
build outstanding vehicles and to cut costs.''
   Another of those taking a wait-and-see approach about GM's
prospects was Beth Fusco of Moody's Investor Services.
   ``The problem is when a company's had a bunch of
less-than-stellar management decisions, you're always trying to
second guess them,'' she said. ``I think a healthy degree of
skepticism is in order until proved otherwise.''
   Analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said GM
may have turned a financial corner.
   ``I think it signals the beginnings of the turnaround; the big
question is sustainability,'' he said. ``If the market softens,
their earnings are going to be in trouble.''
   Most financial analysts expect industrywide sales would fall
somewhere below the 15.6 million cars and light trucks sold during
the 1988 model year.
   For the past year, GM has been steadily increasing its earnings
until the third quarter, when profits typically are lower because of
factory retooling in preparation for the model year which
traditionally begins Oct. 1.
   During that year, however, GM's market share has slipped from
around 51 percent to around 49 percent, a development that is a
concern to all analysts.
   ``That's the problem,'' Phillippi said. ``This is a lot of good
news, but they've still got a market share problem. ... If auto
sales stay (constant) and they don't start to score some market
share gains .... they're going to be facing an inventory bubble in
the latter part of the fourth quarter.''
   ``With a continuing erosion in market share, push has got to come
to shove,'' Fusco said. ``They've got to push those cars out the
door with incentives ... (but) incentives are going to hit them on
the other side.''
   Chrysler Corp. knows about that kind of damage.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker, which relied heavily on
profit-eating incentives during the third-quarter, reported its
earnings fell 54.3 percent to $112.5 million in the period this year
compared with $246 million in the same period last year.

   National Intergroup Inc., a multi-industry
holding company, reported a $50.3 million second-quarter loss
Friday, largely because of poor results in its FoxMeyer Corp. drug
distributor unit.
   ``While we are, of course, deeply disappointed with the losses of
FoxMeyer overall, we are pleased with the results from our aluminum
business and with our sales progress in our FoxMeyer drug company
subsidiary,'' National Intergroup Chairman Howard M. Love said.
   The $50.3 million loss on sales of $731.1 million for the three
months ended Sept. 30 compares with earnings of $2.8 million, or 6
cents per share, on sales of $652.2 million a year earlier. Sales
climbed 12 percent, largely due to gains in wholesale drug
distribution and aluminum.
   For the first half, National Intergroup reported a loss of $40.9
million on sales of $1.4 billion, vs. earnings of $6.3 million or 16
cents per share on sales of $1.8 billion a year earlier.'
   Besides FoxMeyer, one of the nation's largest pharmceutical
distributors, National Intergroup also owns National Aluminum, a
leading producer of specialized aluminum products. The company also
has interests in steel production and energy transportation.

   Oil prices rebounded toward the $14-a-barrel
level Friday, largely because of pre-weekend account reconciling
among professional traders.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the near-month contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude, rose sharply at the
opening and finished 17 cents higher at $13.85 per barrel.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale unleaded
gasoline rose 1.04 cents a gallon to 51.76 cents, and wholesale
home-heating oil rose 0.29 cent a gallon to 43.33 cents.
   Analysts said the maneuverings of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, which had caused prices to plunge early in the
week, weren't influencing the market. Some predicted OPEC's
activities would likely be discounted at least until key cartel
ministers meet again late next month.
   ``Today we had book squaring before the weekend,'' said Peter
Beutel, an assistant director of Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
``We also had trade buying, refiner buying. With prices so cheap, it
makes sense to buy crude and turn it into products.''

   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. charged Friday that
managers of RJR Nabisco Inc. may be trying to sell off
``substantial'' pieces of the food and tobacco giant, a move that
would make it less attractive in the face of the investment firm's
$20.3 billion tender offer.
   In a letter to Charles Hugel, chairman of RJR Nabisco's special
committee of outside directors, Kohlberg Kravis said it had been
advised that RJR Nabisco managers and their partners were ``actively
attempting to sell significant portions of the company and ... may
have provided potential buyers with financial and other information
about the businesses they seek to sell.''
   The powerful buyout firm declined to identify which businesses it
believed RJR Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson and his financial
partners, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Inc., were trying
to sell.
   However, when Johnson announced last week that management was
considering a $17 billion plan to take Nabisco private, he indicated
he would sell off much of the company's Nabisco food operations.
   RJR Nabisco's managers ended talks with Kohlberg Kravis on
Wednesday about making a joint offer to buy the company from
stockholders.
   A spokeswoman at RJR Nabisco's headquarters in Atlanta said the
company had no comment on Kohlberg Kravis's letter. A spokesman for
Shearson said the investment house had no immediate comment.
   RJR Nabisco stock rose $3 a share to $85 in composite New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   Kohlberg Kravis said it believed food business competitors of
Nabisco were among the potential buyers already lining up for sale
talks.
   Selling assets to competitors ``could be detrimental to the
company's business from a competitive point of view and have a
deleterious effect on the employees of those businesses,'' the
letter said.
   Kohlberg Kravis essentially is alleging that RJR Nabisco may be
in the process of employing a ``scorched-earth policy,'' which is
the name Wall Street has given the tactic of a takeover target
selling off assets in an attempt to make itself less attractive.
   ``It makes the company less than whole ... it can make it
impossible to do the deal,'' said Edward Froelich, an analyst at
Pershing & Co.
   If Kohlberg Kravis is serious about the charge, analysts said, it
likely will file suit seeking to prevent RJR Nabisco from proceeding
with the sale of any assets.
   ``If they dismember the animal, obviously you have to change your
bid,'' Froelich said, referring to the $90-a-share tender offer
Kohlberg Kravis launched on Thursday.
   Kohlberg Kravis said in the letter that it did ``not contemplate
dismemberment of the company's operations.'' The firm said it would
retain all of RJR Nabisco's tobacco businesses and ``a significant
portion'' of the food operations if its takeover bid succeeded.
   RJR Nabisco has a plethora of high-profile brand name products _
including Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers _ that analysts say are
extremely attractive properties.
   ``They've got tons of stuff that already has shelf space and
(market) domination,'' Froelich said.
   On the tobacco side, the company's R.J. Reynolds unit makes
Winston and Camel cigarettes, among others.
   Separately, Kohlberg Kravis offered in its letter to allow ``a
significant number'' of RJR Nabisco managers an equity investment in
the takeover. The firm also noted that it intended to retain
``substantially all of the company's employees in the operations
which are not divested.''
   Principals Henry Kravis and George Roberts indicated that they
met on Thursday with Hugel, president of Stamford, Conn.-based
Combustion Engineering Inc. The letter outlined the points Kravis
and Roberts made in that meeting.
   According to their impression of the meeting, Hugel indicated a
``willingness to establish a process providing us with an
opportunity to meet with management'' and have access to certain
non-public information.

and safety fine levied Friday against John Morrell & Co. follows
years of disputes over working conditions at the company's
meatpacking plant here.
   In announcing the $4.33 million levy, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration said the Cincinnati-based company did little
or nothing in light of hundreds of serious injuries caused by jobs
requiring repetitive motion on the meatpacking line.
   OSHA officials said they conducted a six-month investigation
after workers complained.
   Morrell, the nation's fifth largest meatpacker, said it would
seek a federal court order on Monday blocking the fine.
   The fine drew praise from the leader of the meatpackers union
local at the plant.
   ``We actually congratulate OSHA for doing their job. During this
present administration, we found that getting OSHA to do their job
sometimes was very difficult,'' said Jim Lyons, president of Local
304A of the United Food and Commercial Workers union.
   Lyons' union bargains for workers at the Sioux Falls plant. A
six-month strike ended in November 1987, but only about 500 union
workers got their jobs back. The remainder of the estimated
2,000-member work force is made up of replacement workers.
   Lyons charged Morrell did nothing to alleviate work place
problems despite many complaints from workers.
   ``We brought that problem to them. We addressed it with them many
times,'' he said. ``They knew ways of preventing it, and not only
that, we found their medical mismanagement to be incredible, a large
incredible problem, and obviously OSHA found our account to be
accurate.''
   Morrell officials contended the company was being singled out for
penalties in what is a national safety and health problem affecting
many industries.
   It was the seventh time in almost two years that the meatpacker
had been cited for safety problems.
   In April 1987, OSHA fined Morrell $690,000 for alleged
record-keeping violations dealing with injuries. It was the largest
OSHA fine against the company prior to Friday's announcement.
   An administrative law judge in Denver dismissed the fine earlier
this week, however, saying the time limit for levying the fine had
expired.
   The most recent OSHA fine was in September _ a $28,900 fine for
alleged safety violations stemaming from a plant inspection last
spring. The company also contested that citation.
   Workers have complained that Morrell increased the speed of its
production lines at the meatpacking plant and that injury rates
soared accordingly.
   When word of the potential OSHA fine leaked earlier this year,
Steve Crim, the plant manager, wrote a memo to employees saying the
problems were in the past. ``They occurred before new management
took over, both here and in Cincinnati,'' he said.
   Donald Slotkin, former president and chief executive officer,
resigned a year ago and was replaced by Milton Schloss. Corporate
offices were moved from a Chicago suburb to Cincinnati in April.
Morrell is owned by United Brands Co. of Cincinnati.
   Morrell hired a full-time safety director in January to help at
its plants in Sioux Falls and Sioux City, Iowa. Company officials
contend the injury rates have been reduced, but Lyons said Friday
that company records show more than half the work force has had
injuries or illnesses during the first eight months of the year.
   The company said the Sioux Falls plant had the best safety record
in company history in September.
   But union officials said Morrell documents do not include injured
workers who get first aid and are sent back to work.
   OSHA officials said the incidents of repetitive motion-related
disorders at the Sioux Falls plant was nine times higher than the
industry average and 600 times the rate for all U.S. industries.
   Morrell, however, said the injuries that had to be reported fell
from 70.5 per 1,000 full-time workers in January to 16.75 in October.
   Safety and work conditions at the aging plant have been points of
contention many times between the company and the union. The oldest
parts of the plant were built in 1909.
   Morrell and the union have been at loggerheads dozens of times,
including strikes, contract deadlocks, lawsuits and appearances
before regulatory boards.
   The company and the union are in the middle of talks for a new
contract at the plant. Morrell has asked for wage cuts ranging from
$1.25 an hour to $1.75 an hour, to a base rate of $8 an hour. Union
officials have said that if the company continues to push for wage
cuts, a strike is possible.
   The contract expires Nov. 20.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Rebound Sharply From 10-Cent Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices skyrocketed Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for December delivery soaring more than 7
cents a pound in a decisive technical move that analysts said
portends even higher prices.
   On other markets, precious metals also rallied strongly; soybeans
scored sharp gains while grains were mixed; energy futures were
mostly higher; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index
futures advanced.
   Copper for delivery in December settled 7.05 cents higher at
$1.397 a pound; the lightly traded spot November contract gained
9.95 cents, settling at $1.4445.
   The fundamental copper factors of strong demand and tight
supplies exacerbated by a nearly 2-week-old Peruvian miners' strike
were unchanged Friday, analysts said.
   The Commodity Exchange's release of weekly statistics showing a
further drawdown of warehouse copper stocks to 6,863 short tons
confirmed that U.S. supplies have continued to shrink, and
expectations that the London Metal Exchange will report a further
drawdown of its warehouse stocks on Monday prompted some of Friday's
buying.
   But analysts said copper's stongest buy signal was its own chart
pattern. The past week's 10-cents-a-pound decline was simply too
small and too slow to represent a real turnaround in the market's
nearly straight-up advance over the past two months.
   ``It was a pretty good decline but when a market like copper is
going to decline it usually is going to do it a little more
dramatically,'' said Craig Sloane, metals futures analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ``When it goes, it goes too fast for
anyone to get in.''
   Similar chart interpretations encouraged bullish speculators to
re-enter the copper market in hopes that prices will rise even
higher, perhaps as high as $1.75 a pound.
   ``There's no way of telling how high this thing will go,'' Sloane
said.
   Analyst Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. in New York said the
South American supply situation would dictate the market's direction.
   ``Until you see a definite end to that (Peruvian) strike, we're
going to continue to go higher,'' he said.
   Precious metals prices leaped in early trading and finished
sharply higher on unconfirmed rumors that Syrian troops had invaded
Lebanon.
   There was little other news to affect the precious metals Friday
but Cardillo said investors both in the U.S. and abroad appeared to
be shifting their money from stocks to the relative safety of the
metals.
   On the Comex, gold settled $4.80 higher across the board with
December at $414.90 a troy ounce; silver was 8.7 cents to 8.8 cents
higher with December at $6.335 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $10.60 to
$11.70 higher with January at $543.80 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices soared late in the session on the Chicago
Board of Trade, pulling corn and oats higher while wheat finished
mixed.
   With no news to move the markets following an opening dip,
traders responded to chart signals that indicated the soybean market
was oversold and due for a correction, said Cathy Leow, grain and
soybean market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New
York.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents lower to \ cent higher with December at
$4.10 a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 4\ cents higher with December at
$2.78} a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 5 cents higher with December
at $2.35\ a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 14 cents higher with
November at $7.68 a bushel.
   Crude oil prices climbed modestly on the New York Merc while
heating oil was mostly lower and gasoline rallied sharply.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 17 cents to 19 cents higher
with December at $13.85 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent lower to
.29 cent higher with November at 43.33 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .24 cent to 1.04 cents higher with November at 51.76
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures finished mostly lower on sluggish boxed-beef
demand and weak technical factors, analysts said.
   Frozen pork belly futures prices dropped sharply on speculation
that inventories of fresh bellies were accumulating in cold storage
at a record pace. Hog futures were mixed.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .45 cent lower with December at
73.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent lower to .28 cent
higher with November at 81.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with December at 41.20 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .70 cent to 1.45 cents lower with February
at 46.90 cents a pound.
   Stock index futures gained slightly on the Chicago Merc, with the
contract for December delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500 up .30
point at 279.55.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished higher in light trading
Friday, amid lingering investor concern about risky takeover
financing and strengthening conviction that the economy is slowing.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond climbed 9-32 point,
or about $2.80 for every $1,000 in face value.
   Its yield, which moves inversely to price and often indicates
interest rate trends, declined to 8.80 percent from 8.83 percent
late Thursday.
   Dealers said investors were continuing to move away from equities
and corporate securities and into government-backed Treasury issues.
Investors say the rash of recent corporate takeovers and takeover
attempts has raised the risk of investing in stocks and corporate
bonds.
   While the stock market recouped most of Thursday's losses, the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended the week with a net loss
of 33.61 points.
   ``There was a leftover flight to quality from yesterday,'' said
Kevin Flanagan, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Bond prices weakened early in the day after a spurt in precious
metals prices prompted by false rumors of possible Syrian hostility
against Lebanon, analysts said.
   December gold futures jumped to $419 a troy ounce on the
Commodity Exchange in New York, up $8.90 from Thursday's close.
   Investors traditionally turn to gold as a safe haven during
international turmoil because it is considered immune from the
economic volatility, such as higher inflation, that may accompany
the unrest.
   Gold futures later lost about half of their early gains and bond
prices bounced back.
   Analysts said bond prices also continued to be influenced by
government reports this week that showed the economy is slowing,
suggesting inflation is under control and that the Federal Reserve
will not tighten credit and raise interest rates.
   ``There is a growing conviction that economic growth is
decelerating and there is not a serious acceleration of inflation,''
said Elliott Platt, research director of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Inc.
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as
bonds and notes.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point higher, intermediate
maturities were up between 1-16 point and [ point, and long-term
issues gained 3-16 point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, advanced 1.72 to 1,156.34.
   Corporate bonds showed slight gains despite the anxiety over the
recent takeover wave. Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index,
which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities
of five years or longer, rose 0.66 to 295.45.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, were unchanged
at 7.61 percent as the discount remained at 7.37 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 7.88 percent with the discount up 2 basis
points to 7.49 percent. Yields on one-year bills advanced to 8.07
percent while the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.51 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, stood at 8\ percent, down from 85-16 percent late Thursday.

<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. reported Friday that its
third-quarter profit rose 22.1 percent from a year earlier, due to
rising cereal sales and lower taxes.
   The cereal maker said its net income in the three months ended
Sept. 30 rose to $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share, from $119.3
million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Third-quarter revenue was up 13 percent, to $1.14 billion from
$1.01 billion.
   The quarterly earnings were the highest in Kellogg's history,
company officials said.
   ``Sales volumes of ready-to-eat cereal products continued to grow
during the third quarter, with particular strength in international
markets,'' said Chairman William E. LaMothe.
   ``This performance contributed to our increase in earnings, as
did the lowered U.S. statutory income tax rate.''
   In the first nine months of the year, Kellogg earned $379.5
million, or $3.08 a share, up from $313.6 million, or $2.53 a share,
a year earlier.
   Revenue totaled $3.26 billion for the nine months, up from $2.83
billion.

   In the first test of a new, tougher trade law,
the Reagan administration on Friday rejected a request from U.S.
rice farmers that it launch an investigation into charges that the
Japanese government is unfairly blocking rice imports into that
country.
   The announcement by U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
came as something of a surprise because supporters of the petition
were hoping the pressure of presidential politics would force a
different outcome.
   Yeutter called Japan's barriers against rice imports
``intolerable.'' But he said he believed the matter could be better
handled through a new round of trade negotiations now being carried
out under the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT, rather than in direct confrontation.
   The administration had rejected a similar petition in 1986
because it wanted to give Tokyo time to negotiate changes in its ban
on rice imports.
   ``We are shocked and dismayed that Ambassador Yeutter once again
would reject the U.S. rice industry's request,'' said J. Stephen
Gabbert, president of the Rice Millers Association, which had filed
the petition along with the Rice Council for Market Development, a
growers' group.
   The petition, filed Sept. 14, is the first major case under the
new Omnibus Trade Act, which President Reagan signed into law in
August. The new law, which took three years to get through Congress,
makes it harder for the administration to avoid taking action on
complaints alleging unfair trade.
   Two of the biggest election battlegrounds, California and Texas,
are rice-growing states and backers of the petition believed the
administration would not run the risk of appearing weak on trade by
rejecting the petition.
   Both Republican presidential nominee George Bush and Democratic
candidate Michael Dukakis have voiced support for the rice
industry's position.
   In California last month, Bush said he would urge Yeutter to
approve the complaint ``so we can maintain the pressure against
barriers to our exports around the world.''
   Yeutter, a strong supporter of Bush who has campaigned for the
Republican ticket, said he had listened to Bush but believed other
factors outweighed the arguments in favor of launching an
investigation.
   In a second trade matter, Yeutter announced successful resolution
of negotiations with the government of South Korea over charges that
country was unfairly keeping American films out of South Korean
theaters.
   The negotiations were launched after the Motion Picture
Assocation of America filed a complaint. Yeutter said U.S. and South
Korean negotiators had successfully cleared up all matters of
dispute.
   On the rice issue, Yeutter said he believed that an unfair-trade
investigation against Japan, which could have resulted in the United
States slapping retaliatory tariffs on Japanese goods, would have
been counterproductive to U.S. goals in the current round of world
trade negotiations.
   This round of GATT talks, known as the Uruguay round, is coming
to a critical review session in early December in Montreal.
   Yeutter said he would be looking for support from Japan on the
U.S. goal of eliminating all farm subsidies by the year 2000. He
said the trade ministers will also negotiate in Montreal short-term
subsidy reductions which could include rice.
   Yeutter said if Japan does not demonstrate its commitment to open
up its markets to U.S. farm products during the Montreal talks, he
would welcome a refiling of the rice petition. He promised he would
rule on the issue before the Reagan administration leaves office on
Jan. 20.
   But Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., whose district includes some of the
biggest rice farms in the United States, said the decision proved
officials in the Reagan administration ``are patsies when it comes
to doing battle against even blatantly illegal trade barriers.''
   California's senators, Democrat Alan Cranston and Republican Pete
Wilson, also expressed dismay. ``This refusal by the U.S. to take
direct action under our new, tougher trade law could well serve to
reaffirm the practice of protectionism by the Japanese and resound
negatively throughout the U.S. economy,'' said Wilson, who is in a
tight re-election race.
   But Mitsugu Horiuchi, president of Japan's Central Union of
Agricultural Cooperatives, said in a statement: ``I feel certain
that this decision was based on the broader need for economic and
political friendship between the United States and Japan and on the
recognition that agricultural trade between the United States and
Japan is the largest amd most stable in the world.''
   The rice issue has received a large amount of attention in Japan,
where rice farmers remain a potent political force. The Japanese
government permits only a small amount of rice imports into the
country and is committed to supporting the domestic industry, even
though it is inefficient.
   As a result, Japanese consumers pay from six to 10 times the
world price of rice, a staple of the Japanese diet.
   Tokyo maintains that it is essential for the country to protect
its domestic industry because rice, which has been grown in Japan
for more than 2,000 years, carries almost a mystical significance to
the Japanese people.
   Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga last month delivered a long
position paper to U.S. officials explaining the critical position
rice plays in Japanese society.
   The Japanese parliament passed a resolution last month declaring
rice ``closely related to the Japanese culture'' which ``helps to
maintain and develop the wholesomeness of the Japanese society.''
   Japanese rice farmers have even sought to bring Emperor Hirohito
into the dispute, contending that an adverse decision would be an
insult to the ailing monarch.

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Hoist & Derrick Co. said Friday
it has entered into a definitive agreement to buy all the stock of
Denver-based CoastAmerica Corp. for $10.50 a share or $110 million.
   Under the deal, American Hoist will begin a cash tender offer
within five business days, followed by a cash merger at $10.50 for
each share not previously tendered.
   CoastAmerica said the holders of 63 percent of its outstanding
shares have agreed to tender their stock in the offer.
   ``This represents a unique opportunity to realize in one
transaction our plan of creating a national hardware distribution
company,'' said Robert H. Nassau, Amhoist's president and chief
executive officer.
   Nassau said the acquisition will combine three of the nation's
leading hardware suppliers.
   ``Our Farwell, Ozmun, Kirk & Co. hardware distribution business,
CoastAmerica and Globe all have demonstrated their abilities in
certain regions of the country,'' he said.
   Richard H. Bard, chairman and president of CoastAmerica, said,
``Our buying power will be enhanced and our true national presence
will increase our growth opportunities.''
   CoastAmerica is in the process of completing its acquisition of
Globe Distribution, a privately held distributor based in Lincoln,
R.I., Amhoist said. Globe, a distributor of automotive products,
including hardware and paint, will become part of Amhoist after
CoastAmerica is acquired, Amhoist said.
   The acquisition, when complete, will make Amhoist's distribution
business the fifth largest wholesale hardware distributor in the
United States and the largest that is not dealer-owned, Amhoist
said. It said that after the acquisition, it will have annual sales
of more than $800 million.

   The federal budget deficit edged higher in the just-completed
fiscal year, the government says.
   Meanwhile, the stock market staged a modest rally Friday, bond
prices edged higher and the dollar slipped.
   The stock market recouped some of Thursday's losses with a rally
that lifted the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials 9.06 points to
2,149.89.
   Anxiety over the latest merger frenzy had driven the Dow Jones
industrials down 24.35 points on Thursday.
   Bond prices also ended higher, amid lingering concern about risky
takeover deals and strengthening conviction that the economy is
slowing.
   In foreign-exchange trading, the dollar fell in activity
dominated by rumors and continued bearish sentiment toward the U.S.
currency.
   In the budget report, the Reagan administration said the budget
deficit grew in fiscal 1988 to $155.1 billion after shrinking last
year.
   The administration's final accounting for the budget year that
ended Sept. 30 showed that the imbalance between revenues and
spending rose $5.4 billion, or 3.6 percent, from the previous year's
$149.7 billion deficit.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a joint statement
with the White House Office of Management and Budget, said ``the
underlying trend in the deficit ... remains downward.''
   The 1988 budget gap was still well below the all-time record of
$221.1 billion set in the 1986 fiscal year.
   In the first test of a new, tougher trade law, the Reagan
administration rejected a request from U.S. rice farmers that it
launch an investigation into charges that the Japanese government is
unfairly blocking rice imports into that country.
