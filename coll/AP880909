<HEAD>Debates Tentatively Set; Candidates Emphasize Defense</HEAD>

admissions.</NOTE>

   Tentative agreement was reached Thursday on Sept. 25 as the date
for the first of two presidential campaign debates between Democrat
Michael Dukakis and Republican George Bush. While top aides were
working out details, the rival candidates were emphasizing defense
policy during appearances in Texas and Kentucky.
   Dukakis told the American Legion that ``a mountain of debt''
built up during the Reagan administration was endangering national
defense, while Bush, observing the fiery destruction of U.S.
missiles to comply with a new treaty, hailed ``the day we began to
reverse the arms race.''
   The tentative debate agreement was announced by Dukakis campaign
chairman Paul Brountas who said the two candidates would meet on
Sept. 25 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. Brountas
said the second presidential debate would be Oct. 13 or 14 _
depending on the baseball playoff schedule.
   The debates will be general in topic rather than having one on
domestic and one on foreign and defense policy, said Mark Goodin, a
Bush campaign spokesman. He said the second presidential debate
would be held somewhere on the West Coast.
   Vice presidential nominees Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle will
debate during the first week in October.
   ``We are still discussing format, staging and the length of the
debates and we will continue to carry on those discussions,''
Brountas said after meeting with Bush's campaign chairman James A.
Baker III.
   NBC News president Michael Gartner announced the network would
not televise the first debate live because of its commitment to
Olympic Games coverage. He said NBC would air a delayed tape of the
debate after its Olympic broadcast.
   Bush was at Longhorn Army Ammunition plant in Karnack, Texas, to
join other U.S. and Soviet officials in witnessing the demolition
of two Pershing missile engines.
   He called the occasion ``one of those unique moments in the
career of man, a moment when the tides of history turned, that a
new future dawned.''
   The engines were among about 850 weapons to be destroyed by the
United States under the U.S.-Soviet treaty that eliminated
medium-range missiles from Europe. The Soviets have destroyed
several of their missiles.
   ``The missile stages we destroy today are just a beginning,''
said Bush. ``It is a moment we will be able to tell our children
and grandchildren about _ this was the day we began to reverse the
arms race; this was the day we began destroying the weapons of
destruction.''
   Sheila Tate, Bush's campaign spokesman, said the vice president
now favors an increase in the minimum wage, which has been $3.35 an
hour for the past eight years. In line with Reagan administration
policy, Bush has opposed an increase in the past.
   Tate did not say how much of an increase Bush would favor.
Dukakis has made a call for a higher minimum wage a central theme
of his campaign.
   The nation's largest teachers' union announced its endorsement
of Dukakis for president and called for an end to ``eight years of
teacher bashing,'' under the Reagan administration.
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the 1.9 million member
National Education Association, said the union would mobilize at
least 500,000 volunteers for the Dukakis campaign.
   A new poll, done by Louis Harris & Associates for Business Week
Magazine, said Bush had a 50 percent to 44 percent lead over
Dukakis among likely voters. The survey of 1,299 people was taken
Sept. 1 through Sept. 6 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points, meaning the possibility exists that the two candidates
could be in a dead heat.
   However, David Krane of the polling firm, noted that the results
were a reversal of a survey taken a month earlier and said, ``We
feel he's (Bush) ahead at this point.''
   Dukakis addressed the 70th annual convention of the American
Legion in Louisville, Ky., and he said the budget deficits of the
Reagan years were hindering efforts to build up the nation's
military forces.
   Bush and Reagan addressed the Legion convention earlier in the
week and used their appearances to denounce Dukakis' views on
defense.
   ``After eight years and $2 trillion, we still don't have an
anti-tank weapon that can stop modern Soviet tanks,'' Dukakis said.
``We cannot build a strong national defense on a mountain of debt.''
   The Massachusetts governor also backed continued research on
Star Wars, the space-based missile defense system, and said he
would support deployment if it were proven the system would be
effective and was in the national interest.
   However, when questioned by reporters, he also said deployment
would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and that he
wanted to keep that agreement.
   ``I think it is in our best interest to observe that treaty,''
Dukakis said. ``For our own sake, we have to continue with
research.''
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle touted Star Wars
_ known officially as the Strategic Defense Initiative _ in a
speech to the City Club of Chicago.
   ``The next president should make every effort to determine
whether he or his successor could develop and deploy a second red
button _ not just the button of retaliation but the button of
protection,'' said the Indiana senator.
   He also said the United States must strengthen its strategic and
conventional forces even while trying to conclude agreement with
the Soviets to reduce in both areas.
   ``We must probe the Soviet position on START, working to
conclude an agreement while modernizing our forces,'' he said.
   ``We must probe the Soviet position on conventional forces while
continuing initiatives to strengthen our conventional force
posture. And we must probe Soviet willingness to restrain their
clients and to determine whether Soviet `new thinking' will in fact
lead to behavior that can lower the possibilities for regional
conflicts,'' said Quayle.
   His Democratic counterpart _ Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen _ followed
Dukakis' lead in attacking the Reagan budget deficits.
   ``During this election, you're going to hear a lot about a
five-year economic boom,'' he told a business audience on Long
Island, N.Y., referring to the current expansion. But he said
accomplishing that was no trick when the government was writing
``hot checks'' with deficits of more than $150 billion a year.
   ``If you listen to this administration, you would think they are
fiscal conservatives,'' he said. ``But they have not submitted one
balanced budget.''
   ``We're all going to pay the price for this borrow-and-spend
philosophy.''
   On another front, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported in its
Friday editions that Quayle entered law school in 1970 through an
experimental program that was a precursor to affirmative action
efforts at the Indiana University law school.
   The Plain Dealer said the law school admissions program was
intended to offer ``equal opportunity'' to minorities, the
economically disadvantaged and other ``students of different
viewpoints and backgrounds.''
   Quayle spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the program was for ``kids who
didn't make the first cut but showed promise, had something in
their application that showed they had what it would take. In Dan's
case, graduation from one of the finest colleges in the Midwest,
DePauw ... the Harvard of the Midwest, the top of the top.''

   Following a successful practice
countdown with Discovery's five astronauts, NASA officials said
they hope this month to launch the first space shuttle since the
Challenger disaster nearly three years ago.
   ``You have a feeling this train is about to leave the station
and we're about to get on board,'' astronaut Mike Lounge said after
Thursday's exercise, the last major milestone before Discovery's
launch.
   ``We clearly demonstrated that we're ready to pick up the count
for real; I hope that we will be able to do that by the end of the
month,'' Kennedy Space Center Director Forrest S. McCartney told
the launch team.
   The test concluded three days of training here for the
astronauts. They flew back to Houston's Johnson Space Center, where
they planned to concentrate on flight simulator work between now
and launch time.
   Lounge and Discovery commander Rick Hauck will return here for
launch and flight readiness reviews Tuesday and Wednesday with key
shuttle managers. NASA is expected to announce a launch date after
Wednesday's meeting.
   Officials have been discussing a date from Sept. 26 to Sept. 29.
   Hauck, Lounge and the other crew members, Dick Covey, George
Nelson and Dave Hilmers, climbed aboard Discovery for the final two
hours of the practice count, pulling switches, testing
communications and monitoring systems, just as they will on launch
day.
   The only problem was with a ground communications link between
the launch control center and the spacecraft. It was corrected, but
delayed completion of the countdown 34 minutes.
   During their four-day missions, the astronauts are scheduled to
deploy a communications satellite, test new spaceship systems and
conduct science and technology experiments.
   The shuttle fleet has been grounded since the Jan. 28, 1986,
Challenger explosion that killed all seven crew members 73 seconds
after liftoff.

<HEAD>Woman Who Hired Hit Men to Kill Husbands Marries for a Third Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who admitted trying to kill two
previous husbands for insurance money got married again in a
ceremony performed by the judge who sentenced her to 20 years in
prison a day earlier.
   Linda Sue Jones, 37, exchanged wedding vows with William Dobbs
during a brief courthouse ceremony conducted Thursday by Superior
Court Judge George G. Grover.
   ``I really don't want to discuss it,'' Grover said afterward.
``Her getting married isn't an issue in the case at all. People get
married every day.''
   But Deputy District Attorney Diane Harrison thought it was
unusual.
   ``I think that is very ironic. It's like Henry VIII, but she's
up to number three,'' the prosecutor said.
   Dobbs has known Ms. Jones for about 20 years and was considered
``a family friend for a long time,'' said her attorney, David Gunn.
She wore jail clothes during the brief ceremony, said Gunn.
   The choice of judges didn't result from any special affinity
between jurist and defendant, Gunn said, but from convenience.
   ``If her case had been assigned to some other judge she probably
would have made the same request,'' Gunn said.
   Ms. Jones, who stood to collect $600,000 in insurance benefits
had the murders been successful, pleaded guilty Wednesday to three
counts of attempted murder, two of solicitation to murder and one
of gun theft.
   Gunn said she pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors to avoid
the possibility of two consecutive life terms if convicted.
   The bride, who most recently lived in Torrance, Calif., was
sentenced to prison for several 1987 incidents.
   In May, her estranged husband, Douglas Hilliker, was chased
through the couple's Lake Elsinore home and managed to dodge three
bullets fired by 18-year-old Jeffrey Burke, who was hired by Ms.
Jones, the prosecutor said.
   Hilliker, who has since divorced Ms. Jones, survived because
Burke ran out of bullets in the .45-caliber weapon, she said.
   In another attempt three days earlier, the prosecutor said,
Burke tried to kill Hilliker by trying to flag down his car on the
freeway. The 50-year-old Hilliker, who named his wife as
beneficiary on a $500,000 life insurance policy, refused to stop
his car.
   Burke has pleaded guilty to attempted murder and faces up to 11
years in prison when sentenced next month.
   The other attempted murder occurred two months earlier.
   The prosecution said Ms. Jones hired a man to kill ex-husband
Eric Jones of Visalia in March 1987. With the ex-husband out of the
way, she stood to collect $100,000 in benefits from the death of
their teen-aged son, who was killed in a 1986 motorcycle accident.
   The hired killer eventually backed out of the the deal, the
prosecutor said.

<HEAD>Park Officials Go to Rescue of Lovestruck Newts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No newts is bad news, park officials say.
   In an outpouring of compassion for a burdened creature that
lives under rocks and eats bugs and worms, the East Bay Regional
Park District is, for the sake of love, about to lend a hand _ or,
at least, a right of way.
   The 4-inch-long tailed amphibians die by the hundreds under the
wheels of vehicles when the newts cross the main road in Tilden
Park during the fall to mate, district spokesman Ned Mackay said
this week.
   With their weak legs, salamanders are not equipped to scoot
across roads dodging cars, he said. The only answer is to
occasionally reserve the road as a freeway for newts, he said.
   The agency is officially devoted to the little lizards,
conducting seasonal ``newt walks'' to allow citizens to ogle the
critters when they emerge from their summer havens and head for the
marshes to make more newts.
   To better protect them, the district announced that Tilden Park
will periodically close the roads after heavy rains, probably
during evening hours, when hordes of the newts make their
love-driven treks.
   Signs are to be posted on a one-mile stretch of the main drive
that warn motorists of closures, said Mackay.
   Less drastic measures to save the newts from slaughter have been
tried, to no avail. In 1975, four signs were posted that said,
``Caution, Newts Xing,'' together with a larger-than-life portrait
of a newt.
   Within a week, tickled visitors had stolen every one.

<HEAD>In U.S., Each Year's Homicides Mean 600,000 Years Not Lived</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The average homicide victim in the United States
is 32, and each year's killings together mean more than 600,000
years that go unlived, according to federal government scientists.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that in
1985, its latest year for such analysis, the 18,351 homicides in
the United States resulted in 612,556 ``years of potential life
lost'' by the victims.
   Since 1968, the toll of homicides in terms of potential life has
risen 44 percent, the Atlanta-based CDC reported. During that same
time, the total of life-years lost to early deaths from all causes
went down 25 percent.
   Years of potential life lost before age 65 are measured by the
CDC in studies of the most common causes of premature death.
(Sixty-five is a statistical benchmark; the actual U.S. life
expectancy is higher.) On the average, a homicide victim in the
United States is 32 years old at the time of death, the CDC noted.
   The CDC, in its weekly report, called for increased cooperation
among the criminal justice, social services, health care, mental
health and public health sectors, to prompt ``development of
effective programs for prevention of homicides.''
   Black males continue to have by far the highest homicide rate,
the CDC said. In 1985, 6,284 black men died from homicide _ a rate
of 49 out of every 100,000. White men died in 7,467 homicides, for
a rate of 8 per 100,000.
   Black female homicides numbered 1,550, for a rate of 11 per
100,000; 2,630 white females died in homicides, at a rate of 3 per
100,000.
   There was an encouraging note in Thursday's report: The CDC
cited studies published earlier this year showing that the homicide
rate for young black men is dropping.
   The homicide rate for black males 15-24 _ the highest-risk group
for homicide _ fell 13 percent from 1978 to 1984, the last year
that such figures were available. The number dropped from 1,934
homicides and a rate of 70 per 100,000 in 1978 to 1,710 homicides
and a rate of 62 per 100,000 in 1984.
   Government health officials have set a goal of reducing the
homicide rate among black males 15-24 to less than 60 per 100,000
by the next decade. The CDC said statistics ``suggest ... the 1990
objective for this target group can be attained.''

   An Egyptian government official was fined 750
pounds ($1,275) for shoplifting at the Selfridges department store
in London.
   Soraya Abdulla, first undersecretary of state for education,
pleaded innocent and said she accidentally walked out of the store
while looking for a cashier to accept payment for goods she had
chosen.
   She was arrested Aug. 29 after walking out of the store on
Oxford Street in London's West End carrying four ties, a brooch and
four pairs of earrings worth about $370 in all.
   Mrs. Abdulla, visiting Britain as guest of the British Council,
a government-funded cultural organization, had currency worth
$2,665 in her purse when she was arrested, Constable Nick Farmer
told the court.
   He said she told him: ``I didn't mean to steal. I didn't know I
was leaving the store. I really meant to pay. I was in a hurry and
forgot.''
   Passing judgment Thursday, magistrate Roger Davies said: ``The
West End stores are plagued by foreign visitors who come here and
abuse our hospitality by stealing.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
will visit Washington this month for talks with Secretary of State
George P. Shultz on prospects for superpower relations and arms
control agreements during President Reagan's final months in
office, administration sources say.
   The Sept. 22-23 visit is to be announced next week, but three
U.S. officials disclosed the plan Thursday and said Reagan may
participate in at least part of the discussions.
   Over his nearly eight years in office, the president gradually
has shifted from harsh anti-Soviet rhetoric and inaction on arms
control to a cooperative stance illustrated by four summit meetings
with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a treaty
last year to ban all U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear
missiles.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
were no plans for a fifth summit meeting. However, reports persist
that Reagan and Gorbachev will have a final session in Vienna,
Budapest or New York before the end of the year.
   Negotiators in Geneva are meeting on proposals to reduce
long-range nuclear weapons and to limit weapons tests. They also
are trying to set up East-West talks on cutbacks in conventional
forces in Europe.
   After their session, U.S. and Soviet experts will meet in
Washington in a joint effort to slow the proliferation of ballistic
missiles in the Middle East and other areas of the world.
   The U.S. officials said Shultz and Shevardnadze would take up
several regional problems, including Afghanistan.
   The administration has expressed satisfaction with the pace of a
Soviet troop withdrawal from the war-torn country but is concerned
about the continuing conflict between the Afghan government and
U.S.-backed rebels and its spillover into neighboring Pakistan.
   Surveying other regional problems, Shultz intends to question
Shevardnadze about prospects for the withdrawal of Vietnamese
forces from Cambodia and to review U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to
work out a settlement in Angola and to promote independence for
Namibia, the sources said.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze last met in May in Geneva to iron out
implementation of the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning intermediate-range
nuclear weapons and then assisted Reagan and Gorbachev at the
Moscow summit at the end of the month.
   Their sessions over the years on arms control paved the way for
the historic weapons-ban treaty and an overall improvement in
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Still, the officials said there was no indication Reagan would
hold a fifth and final summit with Gorbachev before leaving office
next January. Also, differences over monitoring several types of
strategic nuclear weapons apparently still stand in the way of a
new treaty.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze may continue their talks in New York the
week of Sept. 26, when both plan to attend the special session of
the U.N. General Assembly.

<HEAD>American Satellites Sail Into Orbit On European Rocket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KOUROU, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two American satellites designed to
improve telephone and television service in the United States were
in orbit today after a flawless launch into space by an Ariane
rocket.
   The Ariane 3 rocket lifted off at 8 p.m. Thursday (7 p.m. EDT)
from the European Space Agency's launch site on the edge of the
Guianian jungle, on the northeastern coast of South America.
   About 17 minutes later, the rocket attained orbit altitude and
both of the satellites separated successfully from the vehicle.
   Officials at the space center called the launch ``a complete
success.''
   Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace, the company created
to handle commercial shots, called the 25th launch of an Ariane
rocket ``a special launch, a symbolic shot.''
   ``After the Challenger catastrophe of 1986, we were the only
ones capable of assuring, with the heavy responsibility that that
implies, the replacement of the free world's satellites that were
coming to the end of their lives,'' he said.
   The satellites aboard the Ariane 3 belong to GTE-Spacenet and to
Satellite Transponder Leasing Corporation, a division of IBM.
   Both are designed to expand and improve television signal
distribution, numeric telephone communications and data
transmission in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.
   The GStar III, weighing 2,799 pounds, will complete GTE's
network of three Spacenet satellites. All the satellites, built by
General Electric's Astro Space Division, were launched aboard
European rockets.
   The SBS-5, constructed by Hughes Aircraft Corp., weighs 2,735
pounds and is expected to function for about a decade. A similar
satellite was launched in 1984 and a third in the SBS series is
under construction.
   Three more Ariane launches are scheduled before the end of the
year, including the November launch of an Ariane-4, the new
generation of European rocket. If the launches are successful,
Arianespace will have fired eight rockets into space this year.
   Ariane holds 50 percent of the commercial launch market and
holds contracts for 41 launches worth $2.2 billion. D'Allest said
Arianespace had 30 rockets under construction and was in the
process of ordering 50 more.
   ``We have found clients throughout the world, including the
United States. We think having 20 to 25 percent of the American
market is feasible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Wins Contract To Operate Savannah River Plant</HEAD>

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. next year will
begin operating the federal government's aging atomic reactor
complex in South Carolina that produces nuclear weapons material.
   Joseph Salgado, acting deputy secretary of energy, announced
Thursday that the Department of Energy had selected
Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse for the 5{-year operating contract
worth an estimated $6.7 billion.
   Westinghouse was competing with Martin Marietta Corp. for the
right to replace the Du Pont Co. as operator of the Savannah River
plant. Du Pont, which built the plant and operated it for more than
30 years, announced last fall it would not renew its contract when
it expires next April.
   ``The selection process resulted in the choice of the single
proposer which I believe will operate SRP in the best interest of
this nation,'' Salgado said.
   All three operating reactors at the plant currently are shut
down because of safety concerns or maintenance operations.
   Westinghouse operates six other DOE nuclear facilities. The
company will begin operations at the Savannah River Plant on Nov.
1, working with Du Pont during a five-month transition period.
   DOE spokeswoman Chris Sankey said Du Pont employees working at
the plant will be guaranteed continued employment with Westinghouse.
   John C. Marous, chairman and chief executive officer of
Westinghouse, said in a statement that his company will be
``committed to total quality of all phases of operation.''
   Energy Secretary John Herrington last month recommended the
Savannah River Plant as the site for a newly designed reactor to
produce all the tritium needed for the nation's nuclear weapons
program. He also recommended construction of a smaller nuclear
reactor to produce weapons materials in Idaho.
   The new reactors eventually would replace the three aging
reactors at SRP and one at the Hanford nuclear reservation in
Washington state.

   U.S. and Soviet specialists are mapping out an
ambitious series of cooperative programs, including an exchange of
nuclear power plant inspectors, in the wake of the first visit to
the Soviet Union by a chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   ``We laid the groundwork for a very hopeful, very positive
exchange in the future,'' NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said
Thursday.
   The Aug. 19-31 Soviet trip by a delegation headed by Zech
included an inspection tour of the Chernobyl reactor that exploded
and burned in April 1986, killing 31 people and forcing evacuation
of a large surrounding area in the Ukraine.
   The American group also visited nuclear plants at Novovoronezh
and Rovno, as well as a reactor fabrication facility near Leningrad.
   Talks held in Moscow by the delegation involved the first
meeting of a new U.S.-Soviet Joint Coordinating Committee for
Civilian Nuclear Reactor Safety.
   ``Our discussions were very candid, very open and I would say
very productive,'' Zech told reporters.
   While the Americans and Soviets discussed differences in the
design, construction and operation of nuclear plants, he said, ``it
was clear to me ... that we have much more in common than we do
differences.''
   Zech said both sides agreed that ``if there is to be any future
for nuclear power, we certainly must keep the current plants
operating safely.''
   James M. Taylor, the NRC's deputy executive director for
operations, said the joint coordinating committee had agreed on a
yearlong series of meetings, seminars and exchanges in both
countries, including an exchange of nuclear power plant safety
inspectors.
   ``We hope that the exchange of inspectors will take place during
the summer months next year,'' Taylor said.
   He said the program also would involve sharing of technical data
with the Soviets in several areas of key interest to the United
States, among them:
   _Radiation-caused embrittlement of reactor components and
full-scale annealing of reactor vessels.
   _Studies of health and environmental effects in the wake of the
Chernobyl disaster. ``It's very important information, to predict
and to understand the effects of radiation on health and the
environment,'' Taylor said.
   _Erosion and corrosion of nuclear plant piping.
   Zech said that while it was clear from the U.S. group's onsite
visits that the Soviets have undertaken numerous safety
modifications since Chernobyl, ``we did not make any overall safety
assessment of their plants.''
   At Chernobyl, the delegation was able to go inside one layer of
the concrete tomb built around the crippled reactor, to see the
control room and view the fire-wracked core through a periscope.
Zech said they were the first non-Soviets to go inside the tomb.
   At all three nuclear plant sites visited, Zech said, ``it seemed
to me that the senior managers we met ... were businesslike and
were safety-minded.''
   Robert Newlin, an agency spokesman, said the trip marked the
first visit to the Soviet Union by a chairman of the NRC, which was
established in 1974 as successor to the Atomic Energy Commission.

<HEAD>Chile Leads Surge in Fresh Fruit Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imports of grapes, apples and other items are
growing rapidly to help satisfy a growing American appetite for
fresh fruit, Agriculture Department analysts say.
   Last year, for example, total fresh fruit imports jumped 20
percent to 1.2 million metric tons from 996,000 in 1986, says a
report by the department's Economic Research Service.
   This year's drought also is expected to help boost U.S. demand
for some items, thus adding to the growth in fruit imports. A shift
in exchange rates and demographic factors also has had an effect.
   Grapes made up 21 percent of the fresh fruit imports last year,
with most coming from Chile. Apples accounted for 12 percent of the
total, mostly divided among Canada, Chile and New Zealand.
   The report said the U.S. dollar has been declining against
European currency, the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar since
1985, but it has risen against the currencies of many major U.S.
agricultural trading partners.
   ``As a result, products from these countries are very
competitive in the U.S. market,'' the report said. ``Relative
production costs abroad, particularly in South America and Mexico,
where many fruits are grown, make these countries relatively more
competitive in the U.S. market.''
   Demographic changes also have favored the rise in fruit imports,
the report said. A growth in the number of women in the nation's
work force, for example, has led to greater demand for convenience
food.
   ``Growth in major ethnic groups is impacting food demand in the
United States,'' the report said. ``Generally, the diets of these
groups have a higher proportion and wider variety of fruits than
the typical American diet.''
   The report added: ``Also, within the United States, knowledge of
and concern for health and nutrition have increased in the past 10
years, leading to increased consumption of fresh fruits.''
   Chile has passed South Africa, Australia and Argentina to become
the leading supplier of fresh fruit to North America and Europe
during the winter months.
   ``Because Chile's grapes come into season during the U.S. winter
months, grapes are now available year round to the U.S. market,''
the report said.
   Apples are also a major Chilean export, and these compete with
the U.S. domestic crop. In 1983, imports of Chilean apples totaled
14,780 metric tons. Last year, those totaled 43,020 tons. Another
growing import are Chilean pears, up from 4,216 tons in 1983 to
14,797 tons last year.
   Exports of fresh fruit by the United States have run ahead of
imports, but the gap is narrowing.
   In 1986, exports totaled 1.36 million tons, compared with
imports of 996,000. Last year, exports at 1.5 million tons compared
with 1.2 million tons of imports.

   An Agriculture Department personnel specialist
says there are about 2,000 different kinds of jobs in the
department held by 122,900 employees, including 35 farmers.
   Brad Foote of the USDA office of personnel, says the 122,900
employees include all full-time, part-time and temporary workers
located throughout the United States and in foreign agricultural
posts.
   Foote described the department's job situation in USDA News, a
monthly newsletter for employees.
   The job list includes more than 14,500 forestry technicians,
6,000 clerk-typists, 4,900 soil conservationists, 3,500
secretaries, 3,100 biological technicians and 1,300 accounting
technicians.
   Also, he said, the department has a number of ``rather out of
the ordinary'' positions, such as six model makers, whose jobs are
to develop prototype models for use in research and scientific
experiments.
   Foote said others include four tree trimmers, four industrial
hygienists, three aircraft mechanics, two boat operators and one
sewing machine operator.

   Videotapes and VCRs are becoming part of the
Agriculture Department's public educational packages.
   The latest is a 15-minute tape designed to show farmers, rural
firefighters, pesticide applicators and farm supply store employees
how to safely handle and transport chemical pesticides in
concentrated form.
   Martin Fitzpatrick, head of the department's office of
transportation, says farmers and commercial applicators carried
about 640 million pounds of pesticides over the nation's roads last
year.
   ``But until now there has been limited educational information
on the safe transport of these materials,'' he said.
   The tape, titled ``Be Prepared _ Just in Case,'' was produced in
cooperation with South States Cooperative Inc. of Richmond, Va.
   Copies of the video, in VHS or Beta format, can be ordered for
$9 plus $2.75 for mailing and handling from Commonwealth Films,

   Congressional officials say Texas Tech
University President Lauro F. Cavazos should have no trouble
winning Senate confirmation as the next education secretary, which
would make him the first Hispanic ever appointed to the Cabinet.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee was scheduled to
take up Cavazos' nomination today.
   ``I don't think it's going to be controversial at all,'' said
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who will introduce Cavazos. ``You're
talking about the dean of a major medical school, the president of
a great university who has served this nation on numerous boards
and commissions around the world. He is clearly loved by everbody
that knows him. This (confirmation) is a certainty.''
   A Senate education subcommittee staff member added: ``I don't
anticipate he'll have any trouble. There's a very good chance it
will be unanimous.''
   The aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said a
strong committee vote likely would herald a quick and easy
confirmation in the full Senate, possibly next week.
   President Reagan announced in August he was nominating Cavazos,
the 61-year-old son of a foreman at the fabled King Ranch in Texas,
to replace outgoing Education Secretary William J. Bennett, who
leaves office later this month.
   Cavazos would serve only until January when the next
administration takes over, unless the new president reappoints him
to the post.
   He is the first Hispanic to serve as president of Texas Tech. He
also serves as the president of its medical school, but is not a
medical doctor.
   A registered Democrat, Cavazos has opposed cuts in student
financial aid. He is described as a skilled administrator, a
delegator and a consensus-builder.
   ``His leadership in education on a nationwide basis is well
known,'' Gramm said.
   Known informally as Larry, Cavazos is one of three brothers who
left the King Ranch to attend what was then Texas Technological
College.
   His brother, Bobby, was an All-American running back in football
who now has his own ranch, while Dick became a four-star Army
general.
   Cavazos earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's
degree in cytology _ the study of cells _ at Texas Tech before
receiving his doctorate in physiology from Iowa State University in
1954.
   He became the first Texas Tech graduate to be appointed the
university's president with his selection in 1980.
   Seven of his 10 children have Texas Tech degrees.

<HEAD>Democrats Assess Strategy on Minimum Wage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats say they will try to move a minimum
wage increase through Congress this year, but the issue is being
complicated by presidential politics.
   Members of the House and Senate who handle labor legislation met
Thursday and agreed to try for final passage of the legislation
before Congress adjourns for the year next month.
   But it was also clear that differences between Democrats and
Republicans could doom the bill. The Reagan administration has
steadfastly opposed boosting the wage base, which has stood at
$3.35 an hour since 1981.
   George Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, told
Knight-Ridder newspapers Wednesday that he would soon propose
``some adjustment'' in the minimum wage. Bush's new position
represents an attempt to gain support from blue-collar voters and
came shortly after a campaign appearance at which he was booed
repeatedly by shipyard workers in Oregon.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor
Committee, noted the political implications on Wednesday.
   ``We've been battling on these issues for the last seven years,
and it's fair to say: Where was George when we carried those
measures in the full committee or the subcommittee? There's been
absolute silence,'' he said.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress has been poised for weeks to
consider legislation that would raise the minimum wage to $4.55 an
hour by 1991 in a Senate bill and to $5.05 hourly by 1992 under a
House measure.
   In an effort to pass the proposal by the time Congress adjourns
next month, House Democratic leaders have agreed to accept the
lower Senate figure. On Thursday, Kennedy, House Labor Committee
Chairman Augustus F. Hawkins and others met and agreed to try to
move the bill quickly.
   The measure, however, faces the threat of a veto by President
Reagan.
   In addition, Republicans are ready to introduce amendments that
many Democrats oppose.
   Chief among them is a proposal for a ``training wage'' lower
than the minimum wage, that businesses would be allowed to pay new
workers. In the Knight-Ridder interview, Bush indicated support for
a training wage.
   Republicans say the training wage, which could be paid to each
worker for only a few months, would create extra jobs. But
Democratic opponents say the provision would be a loophole that
would allow companies to pay less money to millions of workers
while not guaranteeing that any of them actually receive training.
   Democratic aides say such a proposal might pass, but would doom
the overall bill because liberals bitterly oppose the training wage
and would vote against a final package that contains it.
   Hawkins, D-Calif., said he considered the training wage proposal
to be a ``killer amendment,'' and said he would pull the bill from
the House floor if the amendment was passed.
   ``I'd disown it myself,'' he said.
   Removing the bill from consideration, however, would allow Bush
to contrast his newfound support for a minimum wage boost with a
Democratic decision to postpone consideration of such an increase
until at least next year.
   Rep. Thomas E. Petri of Wisconsin, ranking Republican on the
labor standards subcommittee, which oversees the minimum wage, said
he did not know what minimum wage changes Bush favors.
   ``I hope when the vice president spells out the changes he has
in mind, we'll have a chance to vote on them on the floor,'' he
said.
   Petri and Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., have introduced bills
that would expand the earned income tax credit to which poor
working families are entitled. They say that such a change would
help low-income workers more efficiently than a minimum wage
increase, which they say would have more of an impact on workers in
the middle class.
   Currently, low-income workers are allowed tax credits of up to
$874, a break that Petri and Boschwitz would expand by for the
first time increasing it according to the size of workers' families.
   Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.,
has been an ardent opponent of Democratic attempts to raise the
minimum wage.
   But he _ along with Petri and many other Republican lawmakers _
support a different formula that would raise the minimum wage to $4
hourly, institute a training wage and increase the earned income
tax credit. It is unclear if this is the idea Bush favors.

<HEAD>Taxpayer Rights Provision Included in Senate Tax Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved in
disputes with the Internal Revenue Service is a step closer to
becoming law as part of a catchall package of tax changes written
by the Senate Finance Committee.
   The bill of rights is designed to change what Sen. David Pryor,
D-Ark., chairman of the Finance subcommittee on the IRS, has called
``a bully mentality'' in the agency that aims to ``strike fear in
the hearts of all taxpayers'' to force compliance.
   Meeting behind closed doors, the Finance Committee agreed
Thursday to attach the bill of rights to a huge bill whose chief
purpose is to correct errors and clear up ambiguities in the 1986
tax overhaul.
   That ``technical corrections'' bill, approved earlier by the
committee, already contains a provision repealing a new law that
has required farmers and other off-road users of diesel to pay the
tax of 15.1 cents a gallon on the fuel and apply later for a refund.
   The committee added a sheaf of new provisions on Thursday,
including short extensions of some expiring tax credits and the tax
increases to pay for them. Overall, aides said, the bill would not
worsen the budget deficit; it would cut some taxes by $2.3 billion
over three years while raising others by $2.3 billion.
   A much larger package already has been approved by the House; it
would raise $7.1 billion in taxes to finance $7.1 billion in
targeted tax cuts. If the Senate passes the Finance Committee bill,
negotiators would attempt to work out a compromise between the two
versions.
   In general, the Senate bill would extend expiring provisions for
shorter periods than the House plan. But there are other
differences. For example, the House bill includes _ but the Senate
bill does not _ permanent relief for about 20 million mutual fund
shareholders who otherwise would be unable to deduct some or all of
certain operating expenses of the fund.
   On the other hand, the House measure does not include the
taxpayer bill of rights.
   Pryor and other lawmakers have been pressing for such
legislation since hearings last year uncovered evidence that some
IRS field managers often ignore policy directives from Washington
and that some agents have shown little regard for the rights of
taxpayers.
   Under the bill, the IRS would have to give a written explanation
of rights to any taxpayer being audited or subjected to collections
actions, and would be prohibited from promoting employees on the
basis of how much money they collect. The agency would have to give
30-day notice, compared with 10 days now, before seizing a bank
account. The measure also would exempt more of a person's wages and
property from seizure.
   In addition, the legislation would give a taxpayer the right to
tape-record meetings with the IRS; require the IRS to forgive any
penalty that was imposed because of erroneous advice furnished by
the agency; permit the IRS ombudsman to halt any agency action that
would impose a significant hardship on a taxpayer; and require that
any tax-due notice include a full explanation.
   The IRS opposes most of the changes as unneeded, insisting, for
example, that it already prohibits promotions on the basis of
collections.
   Other parts of the package approved Thursday would:
   _Retroactively repeal a 1986 provision that prohibited freelance
writers, photographers and artists from deducting expenses of a
project until it produced income. The same relief would be granted
some livestock producers who otherwise would have to pay what has
come to be known as a ``heifer tax.''
   _Disallow any business deduction for the basic monthly charge
for a home telephone.
   _Extend through June 1989 a tax exemption for certain bonds used
to help lower-income families buy their first home.
   _Renew for 1988 only a tax exclusion for educational assistance
provided by an employer; most graduate-level study would not
qualify. Similarly, an exclusion for employer-paid legal services
would be extended through this year.
   _Extend through March 31 a credit for increased spending for
research and experimentation.
   _Renew a tax break for healthy savings and loan associations
that take over failing associations, and extend the benefit to
banks.
   _Permit use of tax-exempt bonds to finance certain high-speed
rail facilities.
   _Allow farmers who are forced by drought to sell draft,
sporting, dairy or breeding livestock to delay tax on such income
for a year.
   _Make it more difficult to avoid taxes on investment in
single-premium life insurance policies whose cash value builds at a
faster rate than those whose premiums are paid in seven equal
installments.
   _Require certain corporations that have underpaid estimated
taxes to pay the shortages fully in the next quarter.
   _Allow an 80 percent deduction for contributions to college
athletic scholarship funds even when such ``gifts'' are a way to
ensure good seats at athletic events.
   _Permit rural letter carriers to deduct 33.75 cents for each
mile they use a personal car on their route; that is 150 percent
the usual rate.

   The Defense Ministry has decided to go
ahead with an air show featuring Spanish, British and French
stunt-flying teams, despite protests about safety stemming from a
recent air show disaster in West Germany.
   The Italian team involved in the Aug. 28 crash that killed 56
people will fly once over the Sept. 19 show, but it will not
perform, air force spokesman Col. Juan Antonio Martinez-Ortiz said
Thursday.
   Martinez-Ortiz said authorities had adopted new safety
regulations for the show, planned as part of inauguration
ceremonies for an air force combat wing of U.S.-built F-18A
fighters at an air base in the city of Zaragoza.
   Hipolito Gomez, head of the autonomous government of the
northern region of Aragon, criticized the ministry's decision and
said it showed ``disdain for the people of Aragon.'' Zaragoza is
the capital of Aragon.
   Gomez, a conservative, asked the government of Socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez to cancel the air show because he feared
for spectators' safety.
   The new Spanish regulations, similar to those adopted at a
recent air show in Farnborough, England, prohibit the teams from
flying toward spectators, Martinez-Ortiz said.
   ``The spectators will be on one side of the runway and the
maneuvers will take place on the other side,'' he said.
   At the Aug. 28 show at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein,
three Italian jets collided while performing a stunt, and one
crashed into a crowd of spectators and blew up.

<TEXT>
   In the middle of this sun-baked
Anatolian plateau in western Turkey, U.S. archaeologists are
working to preserve the tomb of King Midas, around whom grew the
myth of the golden touch.
   Archaeologists believe the 2,600-year-old tomb is the oldest
standing wooden structure in the world.
   About 90 pyramid-shaped mounds of earth rise on the land where
the Phrygians had their ancient capital of Gordion.
   The largest and highest of the burial mounds is believed to be
the tomb of King Midas, believed to have lived from 725 B.C. to 675
B.C.
   The tomb chamber, within a mound about 150 feet high and 900
feet in diameter, has started to show signs of deterioration,
mostly because of lack of air circulation and the high rate of
humidity inside the grave.
   ``There are cracks in the north wall and the wall is slightly
bulging out,'' explained Professor Kenneth Sams of the University
of North Carolina, who has undertaken the preservation work in the
name of the University of Pennsylvania Museum.
   ``There is no imminent danger of collapse but we want to keep
this unique monument as it is for the coming generations,'' he said.
   The tomb was excavated in 1957 under the direction of the late
Rodney S. Young of the University of Pennsylvania.
   According to historians, it was the Phrygians who first
introduced the tumulus, or mound, burial style in Anatolia. This
small central Anatolian village is 60 miles southwest of the
Turkish capital city of Ankara.
   Thirty grave chambers have been excavated, 25 by the U.S.
excavators over the past few decades and the rest by the Germans in
1900.
   The Midas chamber was made of squared logs and an outer casing
of round logs of juniper and pine to take the pressure of the
rubble from a wall covering the tomb. Phyrgians built a roof and a
waterproof stone covering on top of the tomb and then covered it
with tons of earth.
   The body and funeral gifts were placed inside the rectangular
chamber, which measures about 320 square feet.
   Large white fungi today cover the upper sections of the wooden
chamber.
   ``They are slowly eating the wood,'' says Sams. ``We have to
bring mycologists (fungi specialists) here to determine how many
kinds of fungi exist here and why they find this place so
comfortable.''
   Sams said the archaeologists are in the preliminary stage of the
conservation work. First, they are trying to find the reason for
the fluctuations in the humidity, which ranges from a low of 35
percent to a high of 85 percent, while temperatures remain steady
throughout the year at about 60 degrees.
   The Phrygians moved into Anatolia from Thrace and the Balkan
peninsula in 10th century B.C. and became the major power in Asia
Minor in the 9th century B.C., inheriting the remains of the
Hittite civilization. They served as a cultural bridge from the
Hittites to the Anatolian civilizations of the Lydians and the
Greeks.
   They bequeathed to Greek mythology and Roman religion their
mother-goddess Cybele.
   Professor Ekrem Akurgal, one of Turkey's most prominent
archaeologists, said many Phyrgian kings were named Midas, but the
one whose tomb is being preserved is the great monarch who
established Phrygian hegemony in Asia Minor and is mentioned in
Assyrian tablets of the period.
   Akurgal said this Midas is the one on whom the legend of the
golden touch is based.
   According to the legend, Midas, son of King Gordius, was a
spendthrift who begged the gods for the power to turn anything he
touched to gold. His wish was granted but Midas nearly starved
because even the food he tried to eat turned to gold.
   The curse was lifted when he cleansed himself by bathing in the
river Pactolus, known today as Sart Cayi, famous for its golden
sands.
   The burial mounds are on a site on which, according to Greek
legend, Gordius tied his cart to a pole with an intricate knot _
the Gordian knot. Oracles said that whoever untied the knot would
rule Asia. Alexander the Great cut the knot with a stroke of his
sword, according to the story.
   Archaeologists today are particularly interested in the woodwork
of the Phrygians.
   In the Midas burial chamber, excavators found remains of tables,
inlaid wooden screens, bronze and leather belts, bronze cauldrons
and other items lying beside the skeleton of the king.
   A team of U.S. art conservators and archaeologists led by
Elizabeth Simpson of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York are
restoring these artifacts.
   ``This extraordinary furniture from Gordion occupies a special
place in the history of woodworking and of ancient art in
general,'' she said. ``The inlay work is ingenious, the geometric
decoration bold and elegant.''
   The Phrygians used wood of contrasting colors and displayed a
unique sense of design in symmetry and patterns, she said. The
findings from the tombs are also important because very little
ancient wooden furniture has survived.
   The team members have so far restored two inlaid screens and a
wooden table that are on display in Ankara's Anatolian
Civilizations Museum.
   Their restoration work, sponsored by the U.S. Kress Foundation
of New York City continues at the laboratory of the Ankara museum.

<HEAD>GOP Says South African Sanctions Bill Aimed at Presidential
Election</HEAD>

   Senate Republicans say ``domestic political
considerations'' are the driving force behind a move to pass
legislation this year removing U.S. business investment from South
Africa and imposing a near-total trade embargo.
   But Democrats pushing the economic sanctions bill as a means of
increasing the cost of racial apartheid to Pretoria's
white-dominated government say the issue is moral, not political.
   The Reagan administration, which has long opposed sanctions
against South Africa, says imposing them now could undermine
delicate talks in Brazzaville, the Congo, over the withdrawal of
Cuban troops from Angola and independence for the territory of
South West Africa or Namibia, now under South African control.
   ``The negotiations are in progress as we speak; they are in a
very delicate stage,'' said Charles Freeman, assistant secretary of
state for legislative affairs.
   Freeman told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday
that action on the sanctions bill now ``would cause both sides _
particulary South Africa and Cuba _ to harden their positions.''
   At the State Department, spokesman Charles E. Redman, said: ``We
are strongly opposed to the wide-ranging and punitive sanctions
against South Africa contained in the legislation. We believe it's
far more likely to encourage resistance to change in South Africa
than promote a rapid end to apartheid.''
   The foreign relations panel set a vote on the sanctions bill for
next Wednesday, leaving time for action on numerous amendments
which are expected to be offered by opponents of the measure.
   As the committee opened its consideration of the bill, GOP
opponents accused Democrats of trying to build a political issue
that can be used against Republican presidential candidate George
Bush in the fall campaign.
   ``Domestic political implications are driving this,'' Sen. Dan
Evans, R-Wash., said of the proposal to end virtually all U.S.
trade with and investment in South Africa. ``Domestic election
politics can do harm to foreign policy efforts.''
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., complained of Democrats ``making
moral statements as the elections approach.''
   ``It is an emotional issue coming shortly before the election,''
he said. ``It is the political season, not deliberation, that is
moving this bill forward.''
   The 1988 Democratic platform brands South Africa as a
``terrorist state'' and Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis has called for sterner sanctions.
   Bush opposes sweeping sanctions, saying the United States must
remain ``engaged'' in South Africa to retain influence over events
there and to prevent communists from taking control.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., a principal sponsor of the bill, which
is similar to the version passed by the House last month by a vote
of 244-132, said his advocacy of it is not politically motivated.
   ``There's a time bomb ticking away, and it's not going to stop
ticking because there's an American election,'' said Simon who just
returned from five days in South Africa.
   Chances of the new sanctions bill becoming law are considered
slight in the month remaining before Congress is scheduled to
adjourn for the year.
   If the Senate were to pass the measure, the lack of strong
Republican backing for it likely would deny supporters the votes
needed to override an almost certain veto by President Reagan.
   Backers of the sanctions bill said committee action would send a
strong signal to South Africa that it must end apartheid and would
not threaten the Brazzaville talks. Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,
noted that the talks have made significant progress since the House
passed its version of the sanctions bill.

   What would a Japanese rumba sound like? How
about blues written by Johann Sebastian Bach?
   Tap the right keys on Yaakov Kirschen's JFY music generator, and
a computer will compose an original ditty in any of a variety of
musical styles ranging from Druse Arab folk dance to bebop.
   Kirschen, a leading Israeli cartoonist who created the Jerusalem
Post's ``Dry Bones'' cartoon, compares the process to breaking down
music into basic genes that can be mixed and matched.
   ``We take pieces of musical DNA from different styles and tell
the machine to recombine the pieces. What we get is an original
piece of music,'' said Kirschen.
   As he spoke, his fingers flashed across the keyboard to give a
bongo beat to traditonal Japanese music. The result was, well,
regrettable. Mixtures of classical and blues worked better.
   With his machine, Kirschen says, he can mimic almost any style
and produce, for example, the songs the Beatles might have written
but never got around to.
   The combinations are almost limitless, and about 27 million
variations in the styles can be generated almost instantly.
   The machine can also vary the instrumentation, changing from a
clarinet to a trombone with a touch of the keys, and it can print
out an instant score of music.
   Such features are found in some commercial computers and music
synthesizers.
   But Kirschen, a 50-year-old immigrant from Brooklyn, N.Y.,
stresses that each computer tune from his music box is unique
because it produces original songs, even though the tunes bear some
similarities to their ``parents.''
   He stressed that his machine did not store pieces of music, only
a computer analysis of the style, the way notes and tempo were used.
   ``There is no song stored in here, only the relationships that
the machine has found in the music,'' said Kirschen, who works in
creative confusion around a bank of screens, sound boxes and
half-eaten baigeleh, the Middle East version of bagels.
   Kirschen, whose shock of untamed white hair gives him the
appearance of a music conductor, developed the music generator in
part because of frustration at being unable to make music.
   ``I can play 60 different instruments, all of them badly,'' he
said, stumbling through ``Oh Susannah'' on the harmonica.
   Using tunes he wrote on the JFY music generator, Kirschen
registered as a member of the local musicians union as a composer.
   Sally Ariel, general mananager of Kirschen's LKP Ltd. in
Jerusalem, said the firm is seeking a pioneer patent on the device.
JFY Inc., a Long Beach, Calif., subsidiary, is marketing the
invention, which costs about $25,000, to studios that make films,
commercials and cartoons.
   Users say it is a useful took for making soundtracks because it
can instantly invent a tune to match a mood and do it in any
specified time period. It is also not temperamental.
   ``The machine's wife or husband didn't get up in the morning and
create problems so a composer can't work. With a composer I have to
make sure he's in the right mood to create. The machine always
meets the deadline,'' said Dan Setton, a filmmaker of Set
Productions Co. in Jerusalem.
   Denis de Vallance, who runs a film production studio in Los
Angeles, said he was using the machine to write background music
for 26 films that need new sound tracks for marketing abroad and
for animated films.
   ``A big part of pictures is the ambience. A lot of money and
time goes into the background music, but in the end hardly anyone
notices it,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``This is a big
time saver.''
   But he said there were many unanswered questions about copyright
and that artificial music is likely to be as controversial as
test-tube babies.
   ``It may put a lot of sidemen (studio musicians) out of work,
and that's a problem,'' he said, suggesting the issue should be
explored with unions in advance.
   ``Also, what happens if you produce a sound-alike Miami Vice
soundtrack? Is that a copyright violation? I don't think anybody
knows,'' said de Vallance.
   De Vallance said he is using the JFY music generator to write
the base line and then have a composer score an original melody
line for his films. The copyright is shared by computer and
composer, he added.

   Young men who go out at night with romance in
their hearts and condoms in their wallets should find another
storage place, medical researchers say.
   Ozone, a major component of smog and a product of lightning
storms, damages the latex in condoms, and any practice threatening
to tear condoms' packaging and expose them to air should be
avoided, the researchers said.
   ``It's not something you should subject to putting in your back
pocket, or sitting on, or in any way damaging,'' said Russell P.
Sherwin, a researcher at the University of Southern California
School of Medicine in Los Angeles.
   Ozone is a lung irritant produced when industrial pollutants and
nitrogen oxide react in the presence of sunlight. It reaches high
levels in U.S. cities inhabited by a total of 75 million people,
the federal Environmental Protection Agency estimated earlier this
year.
   U.S. sales of condoms _ fueled in part by U.S. Surgeon General
C. Everett Koop's endorsement as protection against AIDS _ totaled
$290 million last year and should jump 20 percent more this year,
market analysts have said.
   Sherwin and fellow researchers tested 20 unrolled, unpackaged
latex condoms, exposing them to air containing 0.3 parts per
million of ozone for 72 hours, a level comparable to a ``Stage 1''
smog alert in Southern California.
   Afterward, all but two condoms had obvious holes in them and 11
burst at pressures far below those that condoms unexposed to
ozone-containing air were able to withstand, the researchers said.
   Examination of the ozone-exposed condoms with an electron
microscope also revealed deterioration, the researchers reported in
a letter in Friday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``The effect on latex of 0.3 parts per million of ozone for 72
hours is serious and deserves consideration for all phases of
condom storage, including the storage and dispersion of
non-packaged condoms by sexually transmitted disease prevention and
family planning clinics,'' the researchers wrote.
   Sherwin said in a telephone interview Wednesday, ``The package
seemed to provide protection as long at it was intact, as long as
it wasn't perforated or crinkled.''
   He said the researchers are continuing studies and plan to issue
formal findings, including whether another common pollutant _
nitrogen dioxide _ can penetrate typical condom packaging, as it
does other kinds of packaging, and cause condoms to become faulty
even when unopened.
   ``The general advice that we offer on condoms holds,'' said Dr.
Robert Staab, vice president of scientific affairs for Schmid
Laboratories Inc., the nation's No. 2 condom-maker behind Carter
Wallace Inc. of New York.
   ``That is that they are going to remain safe and effective for a
normal life of a product, which is in years, as long as you keep
them away from heat, light and ozone,'' Staab said Thursday from
the company's Little Falls, N.J., headquarters.
   The company's packaging is designed partly with ozone in mind by
choosing ``only raw materials that will seal properly'' to keep out
heat, light and ozone, Staab said.
   Schmid makes Ramses, Sheik and Koromex latex brands and Fourex
natural skins brands, but the researchers declined to identify any
of the brands of condoms involved.
   Natural skins condoms also are susceptible to damage from
exposure to the environment, Staab added.
   Recent recalls of several condom lots have increased concern
about their dependability, the California researchers said.
   ``Our general advice is if upon opening a condom and it doesn't
look right, don't use it,'' Staab said.

   Nigerians stand a 1-in-9 chance of being
killed in road accidents, which claim 66 lives each day in Nigeria,
according to a report by a commission headed by Nobel laureate Wole
Soyinka.
   The report, released Thursday, said 79,000 people have been
killed in road accidents since 1980 in what the commission
described as ``carnage and national tragedy.''
   Since independence from Britain in 1960, a total of 154,667
traffic deaths and more than 550,000 injuries have been reported in
this country of about 103 million people.
   The accident rate has increased steadily in recent years, the
report added.
   Soyinka, a playwright, poet and novelist, received the Nobel
Prize for literature in 1986.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Files Sex Complaint Over Short Skirt, `Bimbo' Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman prosecutor who says her
boss claims she looks, talks and dresses like a ``bimbo'' has filed
a sex harassment complaint.
   Brenda Taylor, 25, said Wednesday she was in danger of losing
her job at the Broward state attorney's office because her male
superiors found her designer dresses too provocative.
   The complaint filed last week with the Broward Human Relations
Commission contains a list of grievances against her supervisor,
assistant state attorney John Countryman.
   The complaint accuses him of telling Ms. Taylor she looks and
talks like a ``bimbo,'' and that her skirts are too short, giving
her the appearance of a ``manhunter.'' He also said her style of
dress ``excites'' defense attorneys, the complaint says.
   Countryman's superior, Ralph Ray, refused to discuss the
complaint.
   Ms. Taylor, who was hired in January and is still on probation,
said Countryman wanted her to wear blue or gray suits with bow
ties, typical ``dress-for-success'' women's wear, she said.
   She said he threatened to keep her on probation indefinitely.
   ``I dress in a way I find comfortable,'' said Ms. Taylor. ``I
don't think long blue skirts, jackets and bow ties look right on
me.''
   None of the judges or attorneys she has worked with has
complained, she said. The only letter in her file on the subject
came from a courthouse secretary who reported that two elderly
visitors whispered about Ms. Taylor's short, tight skirt.
   Ms. Taylor said she intended to continue her career no matter
what happens with her $22,000-a-year job.
   ``I just want to be a good lawyer,'' she said. ``I'm not going
to change the way I dress because I haven't done anything.''

<HEAD>Pepper Bill Would End Abuses in Guardianship Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Criminals have more rights than innocent
people facing guardianship proceedings, the House's foremost senior
citizens advocate said in advancing a plan to end abuses in a
system meant to help the elderly and infirm.
   Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., introduced the National Guardianship
Rights Act on Thursday, his 88th birthday, with the declaration
that the current system is ``a national disgrace.''
   His chief co-sponsor, Rep. Don Bonker, D-Wash., said the bill
was designed to ``restore guardianship to a system which does
indeed serve to protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens.''
   People become wards of guardians if they are deemed incompetent
to handle their own affairs. The guardian assumes their legal
rights, possessions and decision-making authority; the ward
typically is not permitted to vote, own property, marry or make
medical decisions. More than half a million Americans are wards of
guardians.
   ``Because the imposition of guardianship is so onerous, there
must be strong national safeguards against unnecessary and unduly
restrictive guardianships,'' Pepper said in a statement.
   He labeled many state and local guardianship systems ``sleeping
watchdogs of personal liberty'' and added: ``Even a convicted felon
is guaranteed more rights in many areas than innocent elderly and
disabled Americans who are subjects of guardianship proceedings.''
   The elderly and infirm would have more rights and recourse under
Pepper's bill and a similar measure that Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.,
plans to introduce next week in the Senate. Guardians would have to
meet new training and reporting requirements.
   The attorney general could withhold federal money from states
not in compliance with the Pepper-Bonker bill. The Heinz bill pegs
compliance to federal Medicaid funds only.
   The House Select Committee on Aging's health subcommittee,
chaired by Pepper, issued an explanatory document citing an
extensive Associated Press series exposing problems in guardianship
systems across the country and case studies presented at a
subcommittee hearing on the issue.
   The panel learned of numerous instances of fraud, abuse and
incompetence. The examples included:
   _An 81-year-old Kansas woman who suffered a stroke and returned
home to learn that a guardian had been appointed to handle her
affairs. After she finished mowing her lawn one day, she was
forcibly taken to a nursing home and remained there for five weeks
before she got the guardianship removed.
   _A 23-year-old Michigan man, a barroom janitor with no
experience or training in handling money, social work or law, who
was given a public guardian job. Within a year he was responsible
for the lives of 80 people and $350,000 in their income and assets.
He later was convicted of embezzling $130,000 from his wards.
   _A Los Angeles woman appointed guardian of her mother, who lost
nearly all of her mother's $250,000 in savings when she placed the
money with a stockbroker who used it to trade options. A new
guardian was named.
   Pepper's bill is designed to prevent these and similar
situations. Anyone facing imposition of a guardianship would have
to receive adequate notice of impending proceedings, be represented
by trained attorneys, be afforded an examination by an independent
professional team, have the right to a jury trial and have the
right to prompt appeal of the decision or the choice of guardian.
   In addition, guardians would have to be of competent character,
receive thorough training, provide at least annual reports on the
financial and physical well-being of the incapacitated person, and
be subject to annual review and automatic removal by the courts.
   The AP studied more than 2,000 guardianship cases. Pepper's
subcommittee cited several AP findings, among them that 97 percent
of guardianship petitions were approved and that 44 states require
guardians to file regular accountings of a ward's money, but they
were missing or incomplete in 48 percent of the files examined.

   The top federal savings and loan regulator is
defending his agency against congressional charges that it is
overstepping its authority in issuing billions of dollars in notes
to rescue insolvent institutions.
   In just the last three weeks the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which regulates the nation's 3,000 S&Ls, has pledged more than $12
billion to prevent the failures of 48 savings institutions, most of
them in the oil-dependent Southwest.
   Half of that assistance was in interest-paying promissory notes,
bringing the total of notes issued by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. to $10.7 billion.
   Members of the House Banking Committee have expressed fear that
regulators will pile up so much debt that a taxpayer bailout of the
FSLIC, which gets its money through an assessment on the industry,
will be inevitable.
   ``It was never the intent of Congress to give an open checkbook
to any governmental agency,'' said Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., who
vowed never to vote for tax money to bail out the industry.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., complained that other types of
assistance offered by the bank board, including various guarantees
against loss, are too open-ended.
   ``It's like giving my kids my credit card,'' he said.
   However, bank board chairman M. Danny Wall told the committee
Thursday that the notes are the most cost-effective way of
assisting insolvent institutions. They are tax-free and thus the
bank board has to pay less interest than on its other borrowings,
he said.
   ``These are costs that will have to be paid by someone
somehow,'' he said. ``A couple of months ago we were being
criticized for not being fast enough.''
   Wall was backed by Rep. Richard H. Lehman, D-Calif., who said,
``I think you find yourself here today somewhat in a `damned if you
do, damned if you don't' type of situation.''
   Other members of the committee accused the regulators of trying
to postpone the resolution of the savings and loan crisis until
after Reagan administration officials have left office.
   The plan ``seems to be nothing more than a massive shell game,''
said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Many of these institutions
will ultimately have to be bailed out again at even greater cost to
the taxpayer.''
   Schumer said the strategy would only ``postpone the day on which
the bill for this crisis becomes due until long after the members
of the current administration have left Washington and are sitting
on a beach somewhere.''
   Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the committee, and
Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, criticized Treasury Undersecretary
George D. Gould, in particular, for maintaining that the FSLIC
needs no new money, at least through next year.
   Gould bristled at the criticism and noted that when the
administration in early 1986 proposed a plan to bring $25 billion
into FSLIC from the industry, Congress delayed action and finally
allowed less than had been requested.
   Wall has estimated the cost of cleaning up the savings industry
at $31 billion, well within FSLIC revenue projections of $42
billion over 10 years.
   However, Wall said Thursday that the bank board in the next 30
days to 45 days would be increasing its estimate of cleaning up
problems in Texas, where most of the industry's problems are
concentrated. As of the end of last year, it estimated the cost at
$7 billion, but since has increased that to $15.2 billion.
   Wall is asking Congress to put the full faith and credit of the
U.S. government behind the FSLIC notes. He maintains that his
agency has the legal right to issue as many notes as it wants, but
he said it would not issue more than $16 billion.
   He also indicated that before the end of the month, the bank
board will issue more notes. In September, he said, the bank board
intends to resolve the cases of another 65 insolvent institutions,
bringing the agency's case resolutions to about 100 between Aug. 15
and Sept. 30.
   Congress since 1982 has extended full government backing to
savings and loan deposits. Wall wants Congress to extend that
backing to FSLIC notes.

   The Senate is moving closer to approval of new
curbs on textile, apparel and shoe imports, defying the threat of a
veto that could put the bill's Republican opponents on the
election-year defensive.
   ``Yes, I'm a protectionist,'' Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
the bill's sponsor, told lawmakers Thursday. ``Foreign importers
are trading our shirts off of us. We're going broke. We need
protection.''
   The measure would freeze textile and apparel imports next year
at 1987 levels and limit growth in each subsequent year to 1
percent. It would halt increases in imports of nonrubber footwear.
   Supporters on Thursday managed to shunt aside three weakening
amendments, and a vote on the bill was scheduled for today.
   There was no doubt that sponsors had enough support for passage,
and earlier Senate votes on the issue indicated they might have a
veto-proof, two-thirds margin. The House, however, fell short of a
two-thirds margin when it approved its version 263-156.
   The textile, apparel and shoe industries were rocked by a wave
of imports in the early 1980s, mainly from Asia. Since then they
have pushed for trade barriers they say are needed to protect U.S.
jobs and maintain their capacity to produce uniforms and boots for
the armed forces.
   The Reagan administration and free-trade forces, mainly
lawmakers from export-minded states, say heightened competition has
made the U.S. textile industry highly efficient and that its trade
troubles are a thing of the past. They note that the companies
already benefit from high tariffs as well as quotas and claim the
companies are crying wolf.
   ``This bill is an ill-conceived attempt to protect some at the
expense of many and deserves to be defeated,'' said Sen. John C.
Danforth, R-Mo. ``The textile and apparel industry has long enjoyed
an extensive web of trade protection.''
   The industry concedes that textile mills have modernized since
the early 1980s and automation has caused some of the drop in
employment. But it says apparel plants have not benefited from the
same technological gains and remain vulnerable to products from
low-wage countries.
   ``Small apparel plants are really the backbone of small cities
in rural America,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.
   The administration says the bill would raise prices, narrow
consumer choices and invite retaliation by U.S. trading partners.
Some of the major textile- and apparel-producing countries are
among the top buyers of American agricultural goods.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter and six other
Cabinet members said in an Aug. 5 letter to lawmakers that if the
bill reached Reagan's desk they would recommend a veto.
   But textile industry officials are hoping that election-year
pressures will make Reagan think twice about following through on
the threat. A veto would bring the politically thankless task of
trying to gather support to avert an override.
   The effort would be certain to claim the spotlight as election
day drew near, handing Democrats material to paint the
administration as insensitive to the very blue-collar workers that
Vice President George Bush is now courting.
   ``I think the realization is there that this is a strongly
political issue,'' said Dan Frierson, president of the American
Textile Manufacturers Institute and of Dixie Yarns Inc.
   Senate margins in early skirmishing on the bill have not been
reassuring to the administration. The Senate voted 68-29 on
Wednesday to invoke cloture _ limit debate to 30 hours. Two-thirds
of the 100 senators on hand for the vote are needed to override a
presidential veto.

<HEAD>Commander Admits He Made A Mistake Aboard Marooned Spacecraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet cosmonaut said he made a mistake when he
restarted the braking rocket of his stranded space capsule after a
computer had shut it down, but he said he was impatient to bring
the craft back to Earth.
   ``Errors were made by the commander. I want to say there is
fault,'' Vladimir Lyakhov told Soviet and Afghan journalists
Thursday at the Baikonur Space Center.
   The cosmonaut, who has made three trips into space, commanded
the mission that ended Wednesday, a day behind schedule. His
remarks were broadcast on the evening television news.
   Lyakhov and crewmate Abdul Ahad Mohmand, the first Afghan in
space, managed to land their Soyuz TM-5 capsule safely in Soviet
Central Asia after 26 tense hours stranded in orbit while their
oxygen and food ran low.
   Problems began Tuesday when the cosmonauts began trying to
reenter the atmosphere and a computer malfunctioned.
   Lyakhov said an infrared sensor in the Soyuz guidance system
malfunctioned during the first attempt to fire an engine that
brakes the capsule, so that it can safely reenter the atmosphere.
   ``The computer was unable to judge whether the spacecraft was
correctly oriented, and the engine was shut off,'' the cosmonaut
said.
   A second attempt was made. The braking engine fired under
automatic control but then shut off.
   ``When the engine switched off for the second time,'' Lyakhov
said, ``I very much wanted to start the landing and I turned it on
for a second time. Of course, in the back of my mind, I realized
that turning on the engine would cause complications. I am not
excusing myself. There was fault there.''
   Deputy flight chief Viktor Blagov told the government newspaper
Izvestia that backup landing sites could have been used, so there
was no rush to fire the reentry engine.
   Then, appearing to defend Lyakhov, Blagov said it ``could be
understood in a purely human way'' why the commander was anxious to
land at that time and place.
   Lyakhov said he and Mohmand had wanted to make a third attempt
at reentry Tuesday but that the craft might have landed outside
Soviet territory.
   He said the crew preferred to wait until landing could be
assured in its designated spot, in the Soviet republic of
Kazakhstan.
   The government newspaper Izvestia suggested Lyakhov should have
immediately assumed manual control over the computer that was
malfunctioning and said that might have prevented the delay in
landing.
   The public questioning of a cosmonaut's performance, and
Lyakhov's admission of mistakes on the widely watched television
news program, were highly unusual. It reflected Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's new policy of ``glasnost,'' or openness.
   Lyakhov, a 47-year-old military pilot, flew in space for 175
days in 1979 and 150 days in 1983.
   At the news conference, the cosmonauts also described what it
was like to be stranded in space for 26 hours with diminishing air,
food and water supplies. They said they had to remain in their
seats in the cramped capsule in the same position as for a launch.
   ``Immobility was the biggest problem,'' the official Tass news
agency reported.
   The cosmonauts had an emergency supply of food and water, but
decided not to use it until absolutely necessary, Tass said.
   Other reports have said the capsule had no toilet, virtually no
room to move around, and only enough air for two days.

<HEAD>Reagan Would Bar Using Aborted Fetus Tissue For Research</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is moving swiftly to
ban the use of tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses in
research before a special National Institutes of Health advisory
committee meets on the matter.
   Gary L. Bauer, President Reagan's assistant for policy
development, told Health and Human Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen
he wanted the secretary's comments on the proposed executive order
by today.
   The NIH panel, formed at the direction of a top official in
Bowen's department, begins a two-day meeting Sept. 14 to consider
the issue.
   A copy of Bauer's memo, dated Sept. 2, along with a copy of the
draft executive order that Reagan would sign, was obtained Thursday
by The Associated Press.
   Campbell Gardett, an HHS spokesman, confirmed that the documents
had been received by Bowen.
   ``There's no comment at this time on the draft order, which is
under review,'' said Gardett.
   The issue arose last April when NIH scientists sought approval
to conduct experiments in which brain tissue from freshly aborted
fetuses would be transplanted to patients suffering from
Parkinson's disease.
   Surgeons in Mexico City reported last January that they had
injected such tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains of two
Parkinson's sufferers with promising results.
   There have been reports of researchers in other countries
employing the emerging fetal tissue transplant techniques, which
also could have applications in many other diseases.
   Although miscarried fetuses have long been used in more
conventional research areas, the new techniques _ which require
fresh tissue to be effective _ open up a new rash of ethical
questions.
   Parkinson's disease causes gradual loss of muscle control and is
potentially fatal. The fetal tissue is believed to work by
stimulating production of dopamine, a brain chemical that people
suffering from Parkinson's lack.
   Much of the opposition to the new research has come from people
who oppose abortion under all circumstances. The draft order
circulated by Bauer says ``final regulations shall be issued by
Nov. 1, 1988'' _ one week before Election Day.
   The White House instructed Bowen last month to enforce stringent
new rules against federally financed family planning clinics that
counsel abortion in any cases not covered by two court orders which
ban enforcement over much of the country.
   However, federal officials acknowledged that the instructions
would have little immediate impact since they would apply only to
grant applications received after Oct. 1 and that only a handful
will be up for renewal even then.
   Private family planning leaders maintained the White House edict
was a political statement to energize anti-abortion forces prior to
the Republican National Convention.
   Bauer's memo said the fetal research order is intended ``to
protect unborn and newborn children from experimentation, research
and organ transplantation, except in cases where the unborn or
newborn child would itself directly benefit by any such
procedures.''
   Dr. Robert E. Windom, the assistant HHS secretary for health,
rejected a proposed NIH project last April in which scientists
would implant fetal tissue into patients with Parkinson's disease.
   Windom instructed NIH Director James B. Wyngaarden to appoint an
outside advisory committee to examine the ethical, medical and
legal implications of using tissue from intentionally aborted
fetuses.
   That prohibition issued in April _ which is still in force _ did
not ban continuing research on tissue from fetuses from
miscarriages or stillbirths, nor would the proposed executive order.
   ``It shall be the policy of the federal government, to the
extent permitted by law, that an unborn or newborn child who has
died as a result of an induced abortion shall not be used for
purposes of research or transplantation,'' says the draft order.
   Although the impact was not immediately clear, the draft
apparently would attempt to inhibit such activities by private
researchers who benefit from federal funds.
   ``Activities and procedures not in conformance with the policies
... above may not receive federal funds, nor may such activities be
conducted by federal agencies or departments or in facilities
governed by federal law, to the extend permitted by law,'' said one
section.
   A few conferences have been held by ethicists and researchers on
the new technology, but no clear consensus has emerged in the
scientific community about how to proceed.
   A letter published in Science magazine last year by participants
in a seminar at Case Western University is one of the clearest
statements on the potential questions.
   That letter, signed by neurosurgeons, ethicists and lawyers,
concluded that there are similarities to using tissue from fetal
remains and using tissue from adult cadavers. But it went on to say
there are dissimilarities that merit careful consideration.
   The letter recommended, for example, that there should be ``a
clear separation between decisions related to the acquisition of
tissue and decisions regarding the transplanting of tissue into a
recipient.''

   Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry: They didn't give
up your ship.
   The brigantine Niagara, restored to fighting trim and still
flying Perry's battle flag, ``Don't Give Up the Ship,'' is
scheduled to be returned to the Great Lakes on Saturday, exactly
175 years after Perry's fleet defeated the British in the Battle of
Lake Erie.
   ``Perry would recognize his old ship. This is as exact a
restoration as there can be,'' said Melbourne Smith, an Annapolis,
Md., marine architect who dismantled the Niagara and rebuilt it to
historical specifications.
   The 182-foot, 278-ton ship, restored for the third time with
$3.8 million in state and private money in dry dock at this port
city, will be outfitted by next spring with 118-foot and 113-foot
masts, square rigging, about 22,000 square feet of polyester sail
and 20 aluminum cannons.
   Then, it is to tour the Great Lakes and East Coast ports as
Pennsylvania's ``official flagship.''
   The first USS Niagara was one of six small ships built at Erie
during the War of 1812 and put under Perry's command to break a
British blockade of American Great Lakes ports and to defend the
Northwest Territory.
   On Sept. 10, 1813, Perry's nine-ship squadron met six British
vessels under Commodore Robert Heriot Barclay in a short but fierce
battle near Put-in-Bay, Ohio, that left 135 British and 123
American casualties.
   Perry's flagship, the USS Lawrence, was disabled by British fire
and Perry transferred to the Niagara, where he hoisted his famous
blue-and-white battle flag and attacked again. The Niagara helped
break the British battle line and forced Barclay to surrender.
   ``We have met the enemy and they are ours: two ships, two brigs,
one schooner and one sloop,'' Perry reported to his superiors.
   The Niagara served as a station ship in Erie until 1820, when
she was scuttled in nearby Misery Bay. The ship was raised by Erie
citizens in 1913 and restored for a Great Lakes tour to celebrate
the 100th anniversary of Perry's victory. She was restored again in
the 1930s and 1940s.
   The latest Niagara incorporates 42 pieces of the original ship,
some within view for visitors. Smith said the original wood is aged
and not strong enough for structural use.
   ``It will be obvious,'' he said.
   In 1813, a gang of about 300 shipwrights, blacksmiths and other
craftsmen and laborers, directed by New York shipbuilders Adam and
Noah Brown, hired on at Erie and built Perry's fleet in three
months. There were no sawmills in Erie, which then had only 500
inhabitants, and craftsmen cut, hewed and squared the unseasoned
wood by hand.
   ``It was all green wood from around here. It wouldn't last two
years,'' Smith said. ``But it didn't matter. This was a throwaway
boat for war.''
   Smith's modern crew of about 60, working over 99 days, included
shipwrights and carpenters experienced in restoring old ships. They
were assisted by laborers from the Pennsylvania Conservation Corps,
a job training program for disadvantaged youth.
   They worked in a dockyard where Perry's smaller gunboats were
built in 1813. The Niagara and Lawrence were built nearby,
according to project spokeswoman Maura McLaughlin.
   The Niagara's new 18-pound carronades, which are stubby cannons
for short-range use, and two 12-pound long guns, will be cast at an
Erie foundry of aluminum to save 10 tons of weight on deck. The
Navy removed the original cannons before sinking the Niagara.
   ``Ships like this weren't very safe to sail. They were top
heavy,'' Smith said. ``But it was wartime and it didn't matter. In
wartime, you do dangerous things.''
   Smith estimated a crew of about 35 will be needed to sail the
restored ship as it tours the Great Lakes beginning next summer.
The state does not plan to give rides or to rent the ship.

   An ailing President Jose
Napoleon Duarte inaugurated a rural development project in this
northern rebel stronghold in his first public ceremony in more than
three months.
   Duarte, 62, is suffering from terminal cancer. He has lost 35
pounds and most of his hair because of chemotherapy treatment.
   But his voice and step were firm Thursday as he opened the $5
million project in the provincial capital 45 miles north of San
Salvador. Chalatenango is a stronghold of leftist guerrillas who
have waged a nearly 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backed
government.
   After the ceremony Duarte, who wore a blue cap from Notre Dame,
his alma mater, was asked by The Associated Press how he felt.
   ``Good,'' he said. ``I am getting stronger every day.''
   But a measure to declare Duarte incapable of carrying out his
duties due to incurable liver cancer was referred to committee in
the legislature Thursday.
   Ramon Rosales, leader of the tiny conservative party MERECEN,
presented the proposal. His party has no legislators, but private
citizens may speak in Congress and present proposals if backed by a
legislator. Rosales' motion was supported by a member of the
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance.
   The measure is not considered likely to succeed. Under the
constitution, further action requires the unanimous opinion of five
physicians designated by Congress and the approval of 40 of the
legislature's 60 members.
   Duarte said after the ceremony in Chalatenango that his next
treatment, set for late this month, should not weaken him as much
as the previous one.
   When cancer was diagnosed in early June, doctors said Duarte had
six to 18 months to live. The chemotherapy that ended in early
August was complicated by diabetes. Duarte was bedridden and very
weak for 10 days in mid-August.

   Health workers are trying to identify an
illness that has claimed more than 300 lives in northern Nigeria, a
newspaper reported.
   The independent Lagos Guardian, quoting local officials, said
the deaths were reported in Kano state, and the government had
dismissed malaria or malnutrition as the possible cause.
   Most of the deaths occurred after an illness of no more than 48
hours, the newspaper reported Thursday.
   A team was in the area taking blood samples to try to identify
the illness, the Guardian said.
   Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, suffers from many
water-borne diseases such as cholera because of inadequate safe
water supplies. The government warned of an expected outbreak of
such diseases following recent heavy rains.

<TEXT>
   The government issued exit visas this year to
15,715 ethnic Germans, a sharp increase over previous levels, a
spokesman announced.
   Spokesman Vadim Perfiliev told reporters Thursday that the
figure covers the first seven months of 1988 and includes 844
children. He said 7,000 applications are now being processed.
   This year's figure is 150 percent higher than last year's,
Perfiliev said.
   He said 142 requests for visas were denied in the first seven
months of 1988 on the grounds that the applications included
falsified information, either about relatives in West Germany or
about applicants themselves.
   The Soviet Union has about 1.6 million citizens of German
extraction, most of them in western parts of the country. During
various periods in Russian history, Germans were invited to serve
as technicians in various areas. Many established wealthy
agricultural colonies and maintained their ethnic identities.
   Before World War II, ethnic Germans living in the Middle Volga
area had their own autonomous region, but during the war their
republic was abrogated and they were moved eastward into Siberia
and Middle Asia.

   George Bush and Michael Dukakis, naturally
enough, are being called upon to give American voters an idea of
how they will cope with U.S. foreign policy problems.
   Never mind that what a candidate says on the stump, in a debate
or on the tube may have little bearing on what he does once he is
president. Circumstances change. Crises erupt. Opportunities arise.
Also, he can act more in accord in the Oval Office with what he
feels ought to be done abroad, rather than what will endear him to
the voters.
   But both in the midst of the campaign and afterward, what is
often overlooked is how little influence America, even with its
nuclear might and democratic aspirations, can exert in most of the
world.
   It's one thing to try to work out an arms control accord with
the Soviet Union or to try to nudge Arabs and Israelis toward the
negotiating table. It's quite another to try to dissuade Iraq from
crushing its Kurdish minority, reportedly with devastating dosages
of chemical weapons.
   Washington and Moscow clearly can control their rockets, but
their halting efforts to prevent the nuclear club from taking in
new members is an example of how limited U.S. influence really is
in the world.
   A president can try to slow proliferation by constraining
shipments of technology. He can also try his powers of persuasion
on friendly or semi-friendly states. But their leaders make their
decisions largely on the basis of national interests, not deference
to the United States.
   U.S. influence tends to be greater with kindred democracies, but
they are already more inclined to yield to pressure from Washington
than nonaligned or antagonistic governments.
   And in the event of revolutions and natural calamities, often
the most that the United States can offer is statements of good
will _ as illustrated by what has been going on this week on the
international scene.
   In Burma, perhaps 1 million soldiers, police, uniformed state
factory workers, Buddhist monks, Catholic nuns, students, teachers
and housewives marched through Rangoon, the capital, seeking an end
to 25 years of repressive one-party rule.
   The Asian country's future may be in their hands, but evidently
there is virtually nothing the United States can do to promote
democracy. Americans, like other outsiders, are concentrating their
efforts right now on evacuating diplomats' dependents in the event
of anarchy while keeping the U.S. embassy open to demonstrate the
U.S. presence.
   In hapless and teeming Bangladesh, where the worst floods in 70
years have left as many as 28 million people homeless or stranded,
the United States is providing nearly $3.6 million in additional
food, transportation and other emergency aid.
   This is an expression of American generosity, but it is a
band-aid applied to an epidemic of population explosion and limited
resources that, for instance, led the Bengalis to chop down trees
that would have slowed the waters in order to build the houses now
immersed. An estimated 110 million people are crowded into an area
the size of Wisconsin.
   In Iraq, tens of thousands of Kurds, a non-Arabic people seeking
autonomy, have fled to neighboring Turkey. They are the fortunate
ones. According to reports, tens of thousands of other Kurds were
massacred with cyanide and other chemical weapons in what refugees
called a ``war of extermination.''
   The State Department voiced concern about Iraq's treatment of
civilians. It also condemned the use of poison gas as abhorrent,
unjustifiable and unacceptable.
   Throughout the Iran-Iraq war, the State Department has expressed
grave abhorrence to chemical weapons. But that evidently did not
deter Baghdad, just as U.S. entreaties did not stop China from
providing Iran with anti-ship missiles.
   Even friendly governments can be stubborn.
   Four trips to the region by Secretary of State George P. Shultz
this year failed to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and King Hussein of Jordan to engage in Middle East peace talks.
   On the other hand, dedicated U.S. diplomacy may finally be
paying off in southern Africa. Under American tutelage, Cuba and
South Africa may be on the verge of a settlement that will remove
Cuban troops from Angola and provide independence for Namibia.
   So the United States _ and whoever is in the Oval Office _ keeps
trying.

<HEAD>NRC Expected To Vote Next Week on Seabrook Obstacle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission vote next week
is likely to remove a major hurdle in the long quest by operators
of the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant to obtain a low-power
operating license.
   None of the commissioners objected to the proposed rules change
at a staff briefing Thursday, and NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr.
said afterwards that he likely would take the staff's
recommendation and support it. A vote is scheduled for next Friday.
   The proposal would allow Seabrook to receive a license to
conduct tests at 5 percent power capacity without having a system
in place to notify residents within 10 miles of the reactor of an
accident.
   ``It is highly unlikely that members of the general public would
be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation following an accident
at low power,'' the staff said in a 23-page report to the
commissioners.
   The rule, if adopted, would allow the commission to reverse a
February ruling by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board
that blocked a low-power license after sirens were removed from the
Massachusetts municipalities within the plant's 10-mile zone.
   New Hampshire Yankee, the plant's operator, was forced to remove
the sirens after a federal appeals court sided with state and local
officials. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and other plant
opponents wanted the sirens removed because they believe no
evacuation system can adequately protect nearby residents.
   Under the new rule, New Hampshire Yankee still would need a
notification system for a full-power license. The company has
suggested truck-mounted sirens and siren-equipped helicopters as
replacements.
   Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said in a telephone
interview Thursday that the state probably would not try to block
the rule change in court, but instead challenge the actual license
if it is eventually issued.
   After the siren issue, the only other low-power question pending
before the commission is an appeal by Seabrook critics that the
reactor's bleak financial condition should block issuance of the
permit.
   It is unclear when that issue will be decided and whether it
will hold up the oft-delayed license, said Martin G. Malsch, deputy
general counsel for licensing and regulation at the commission.
   Zech declined to comment on the potential impact of the
financial qualification question.
   ``We're taking one step at a time with Seabrook,'' he said.

<HEAD>Poor Weather Hampers Airline Arrivals in Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About four of every five flights by major U.S.
airlines arrived on time in July, although poor weather held down
the on-time performance in the heavily traveled air corridors of
the Northeast, according to Transportation Department figures.
   Two carriers serving the Sun Belt _ America West and Southwest
Airlines _ reported better than 91 percent of their flights on time
during July. Airports in Salt Lake City, Phoenix and Las Vegas had
the best arrival rates.
   The monthly statistics were released by the department Thursday.
   Pan American World Airways had the worst arrival record among
the 13 airlines monitored, with only 68.8 percent of its July
flights arriving within 15 minutes of schedule, the government's
on-time standard. The department provided more recent figures for
consumer complaints, showing that Pan Am also had the highest rate
in that category in August.
   Overall, 81.5 percent of the more than 441,000 flights during
July arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, slightly fewer than the
84.3 percent during June.
   The figures do not include delays caused by mechanical problems,
but do include those that are due to poor weather. Airlines that
have a concentration of flights in the Southwest have consistently
performed well, as did airports in that part of the country.
   On the other hand, airports in the Northeast where weather as
well as heavy air traffic contributed to delays were generally at
the bottom of the on-time list, as were some of the air carriers
that serve that region.
   The three New York City area airports _ LaGuardia, John F.
Kennedy and Newark International _ as well as Philadelphia had the
worst arrival rate, with about one-third of their flights delayed.
Boston and Pittsburgh, where a runway repair project also added to
delays, also fared badly.
   The Transportation Department began monitoring airline arrival
rates last September amid growing complaints about flight delays
and poor service.
   Delta Air Lines, which earlier this year struggled well down the
list in on-time performance among the 13 carriers, posted the third
best arrival rate in July with 86.1 percent of its flights on time.
   In addition to Pan Am, the airlines with the worst record were
Piedmont Airlines and USAir, both of which reported arrival rates
of slightly better than 74 percent.
   David Shipley, a USAir spokesman, blamed the poor showing on the
runway problem at Pittsburgh, where USAir has its major hub, as
well as weather problems. He said 10 percent of USAir's total
arrival delays were linked to the runway being closed.
   Salt Lake City had the best arrival rate of the 27 airports
monitored, with 92.3 percent of its flights arriving on time. The
other two airports with arrival rates of better than 90 percent
were Phoenix and Las Vegas, Nev.
   Meanwhile, complaints from air travelers to the Transportation
Department's office of consumer affairs continued to decline
compared with 1987, as they have steadily during the year.
   During August, the department received 2,363 complaints from air
travelers, two-thirds fewer than the 7,337 received during the same
month a year ago.
   Pan Am had the worst record, with 17.14 complaints for every
100,000 passengers flown, followed by Hawaiian Airlines, with 13.18
and TWA with 10.75.
   Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines, which during most
of the past year have led the airlines in number of complaints,
showed a sharp improvement with their July figures. Continental had
its best month in a year, with 9.94 complaints per 100,000
passengers, and Northwest had 6.2 rate of complaints.
   The August complaint statistics were released along with the
July on-time statistics.
   The number of mishandled bags increased slightly during July to
7.15 per 1,000 boardings from 6.76 in June. TWA had the highest
number of such complaints, 11.65 for every 1,000 boardings.

   Three people have sued to change the title of
``The Last Temptation of Christ'' to ``The Lies and Profanations of
Universal Pictures as pertaining to the life of Our Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ.''
   The three Pittsburgh residents said in an Allegheny County
Common Pleas lawsuit filed recently that the controversial film
turns Jesus Christ into a ``vacillating, weak, sinful and almost
demented individual.''
   Named as defendants are Universal Pictures Inc., the producers,
Cineplex Odeon Films Inc. and the King's Court Theater, where the
film is being shown in Pittsburgh.
   Plaintiffs Michael Greb, Paul Metzger and Betti Logan, in
demanding the new title, say that for Universal to call the film
fiction is a lie used to ``blaspheme Christ with unlicensed
freedom.''

   PACs to the max?
   After more than a decade of explosive growth by political action
committees, the rate of PAC receipt and spending increases has
fallen dramatically during the 1987-88 election cycle.
   The dollar amounts continue to set record highs, according to
figures released Thursday by the Federal Election Commission, but
several political scientists say the far-lower growth rates from
previous cycles indicate that the PAC movement may be leveling off
and reaching its saturation point.
   The FEC said that for the 18 months ending June 30, PACs
representing business, labor, ideological and other interest groups
spent $215.4 million, a 4.8 percent increase over the same period
in the 1985-86 election cycle.
   This increase was well below the 38 percent rise in PAC spending
that occurred in the corresponding 18 months of the 1985-86 cycle
when compared with the 1983-84 cycle, which itself was up 44
percent over 1981-82.
   Receipts by PACs showed a similar slowing in growth. The $266.6
million collected during the first 18 months of the current cycle
was 4.7 percent above 1985-86, which saw 18-month receipts running
30 percent above 1983-84, which was 42 percent over 1981-82.
   As of June 30, PACs had given $94.9 million to candidates for
federal office: $3 million to presidential races, $32.7 million to
Senate candidates and $59.2 million to House candidates.
   This represented a 21 percent increase over the same 18 months
in 1985-86. This rate, however, was below the 38 percent rise from
1983-84 to 1985-86 and the 49 percent growth from 1981-82 to
1983-84.
   Incumbent senators and representatives got got nearly 90 percent
of the money contributed by PACs to congressional races in the
first 18 months of this election cycle. Democrats led Republicans
$60.9 million to $33.9 million.
   Norman Ornstein, a congressional analyst with the American
Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, said the
double-digit percentage increases in PAC receipts and spending
couldn't continue indefinitely.
   ``We may have reached a saturation point,'' he said. ``That's
good news for all of us except campaign vendors.''
   Ornstein said ``it's hard to say whether we've got a long-term
trend.''
   He said the reduced rates of increase could be partly
attributable ``to so few competitive races in the House.''
   ``There isn't the demand from incumbents to put the screws to
PACs,'' he said.
   Janet Grenzke, a political science professor at Holy Cross
College in Worcester, Mass., said the figures could indicate ``the
saturation point is nearing'' for PACs.
   ``Those people who were going to form PACs and who were going to
participate in the political process through them have pretty much
done so,'' Grenzke said.
   She said some political money that previously might have been
channeled through PACs now could be ending up as ``soft money,''
the less-controlled and little-reported cash flow increasingly
finding its way to places like political party committees.
   Herb Alexander, a political science professor at the University
of Southern California, said the number of PACs has leveled off, as
has the number of PACs that are really active.
   ``A couple of hundred PACs do half the business,'' he said.
``There's an ingrown limitation on how much they can raise. ...
While it's not at a standstill, the growth rate isn't as
explosive.''
   Randy Huwa of Common Cause, the self-described citizens lobby
that has been urging Congress to outlaw PACs, said he was not
heartened by the latest FEC figures.
   ``The first thing I look at is contributions to candidates, and
that's continuing to grow,'' he said.

apparently hasn't stuck in the memories of George Bush and his
eldest son.
   George Bush Jr. confused the date Thursday during an interview
on the Michael Jackson syndicated radio talk show. His father, the
Republican presidential candidate, got the date mixed up Wednesday.
   During a discussion about the campaign with host Jackson, the
candidate's oldest son lamented that ``the problem is that so much
of what we see in presidential politics is the 15-second sound bite
on TV.''
   ``Last night for example, the 15-second sound bite on my dad on
the national networks was the fact that he slipped for 45 seconds
on whether Pearl Harbor was on September 9th or December 9th.
   ``And they made a big deal of that on TV. I didn't quite get the
point, because he, you know, corrected himself.''
   Jackson did not note that the younger Bush had misquoted his
father who had said during a speech Wednesday, Sept. 7, to the
American Legion in Louisville, Ky: ``I wonder how many Americans
remember. Today is Pearl Harbor Day. Forty-seven years ago to this
very day we were hit, and hit hard at Pearl Harbor. We were not
ready...''.
   Within a minute or so, Bush corrected himself.
   Both Bushes misstated the date of the attack, Dec. 7, 1941,
which marked America's entry into World War II and was proclaimed
``a date which will live in infamy'' by President Franklin D.
Roosevelt.

<HEAD>Gang-Related Deaths Up Nearly 70 Percent, Takes Toll on
Neighborhoods</HEAD>

   Carmen Rodriguez cries when she remembers the
night her daughter died in the cross fire of rival street gangs.
   But her tears cannot keep the young people in their gang colors
out of her neighborhood _ one of the areas of the city suffering
from an increase of nearly 70 percent in gang-related killings so
far this year.
   Police say the use of heavier caliber guns and the closure of 10
city hospitals in four years have contributed to the surge in
gang-related deaths. The reluctance of witnesses to testify against
gang members adds to the frustration of victims' families.
   ``People saw,'' Mrs. Rodriguez says of her daughter's shooting,
her eyes swollen from weeping as she stands in front of her
family's small candy store in a predominanty Hispanic neighborhood
southwest of downtown.
   ``I bend down on my knees. I say, `Please tell me.' They don't
say anything.''
   Mrs. Rodriguez says she has too much invested to leave this
working-class neighborhood, where she moved 32 years ago from
Puerto Rico and raised 10 children.
   One of those children was Delma, who was 28 when she died on
July 1, 1987, the victim of a bullet fired from the darkness as she
sat with her mother on the hood of a car near the family home and
the store.
   ``I only pray some day they catch the guy,'' Mrs. Rodriguez says.
   The killing was one of four in a four-square-block area in the
last two years, says Frances Sandoval, another neighborhood
resident and victim of gang violence.
   Mrs. Sandoval founded Mothers Against Gangs after her oldest
son, Arthur, was fatally stabbed by a gang member in 1985. She says
Arthur, an honor student and 15-year-old high school sophomore, had
come to the aid of a friend's sister.
   Gang-related killings increased to 37 through July from 22 in
the same period last year, a jump of 68 percent, authorities said.
   However, Cmdr. Sollie Vincent, head of the Police Department's
Gang Crimes Unit, said gang warfare has not escalated as much as
the death count suggests. The number of gang-related aggravated
battery cases such as shootings and stabbings rose to 730 in the
first seven months of this year from 700 in the same period last
year, he said.
   ``We suspect that they are using better weaponry, probably
heavier caliber guns,'' Vincent said.
   Hospital closings that have stretched emergency room resources
thin also may be aggravating the death toll, he added.
   Gang killings have worsened in other major cities as well. Los
Angeles County expects more than 420 gang-related killings this
year, up from 387 in 1987, and drive-by slayings now average more
than one a day. Los Angeles gangs are expanding their
cocaine-trafficking networks as far away as Seattle, Kansas City,
Mo., and Philadelphia.
   In Chicago, there are an estimated 125 gangs involving 12,000 to
15,000 youths with an average age of about 18, Vincent said. Some
members are as young as 10 or 11.
   The gangs account for about 1 percent of all city crime, but 5
percent to 6 percent of homicides, Vincent said.
   Most gang members are black or Hispanic, the products of
poverty, poor schools or broken families, he said.
   The black gangs tend to be heavily involved in drug trafficking,
Vincent said. The Hispanic gangs seem more interested in protecting
territory and showing gang colors, resulting in more ``irrational''
shootings, he said.
   There's an elementary school across the street from Mrs.
Rodriguez's store, and a Catholic church across a small plaza where
children play football by day.
   But after sundown, the neighborhood streets often are claimed by
clusters of young people displaying their gang colors.
   ``We're talking about a small minority that has been allowed to
defame our community,'' Mrs. Sandoval said.
   Some of the recent gang-linked shootings have been drive-bys.
Mrs. Sandoval says police often are slow to respond to gang
violence, allow young people to congregate past curfew and reassign
detectives and gang specialists to civic festivals.
   Vincent denies that enforcement has been lax.
   ``In a drive-by shooting, if you had a million police, how could
you stop that?'' he said.

   Officials in a city near Tokyo discovered last year
that industrial waste contaminated wells used for the drinking
water of up to 25,000 people, but they waited until Thursday to
announce it.
   ``Though we had found the levels to be in excess, we were still
unsure just how widespread it was,'' said Masaru Yano of the
Kimitsu city office's Environment Conservation Department.
   Yano said the city waited to announce the contamination because
investigations still were under way, but he said a small number of
residents directly affected by it were told earlier.
   He said the substance found in the wells, trichloroethylene, may
cause cancer in humans. Acceptable levels in drinking water were
established by Health and Welfare Ministry guidelines in 1984.
   In March 1987, officials found two of seven local wells in
Kimitsu, 27 miles southeast of Tokyo, contaminated with the
substance. The city then expanded its investigation to cover 43
wells.
   Between May 1987 and June 1988, 10 wells were found to have been
polluted, with one registering 237 times the acceptable level of
0.03 milligrams per liter, according to Yano.
   Four of the 10 contaminated wells were not in use, but water
from one is believed to have mixed with a larger system used by
25,000 residents, said an official with the Kimitsu Waterworks
Department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
all contaminated wells have been shut down.
   The 25,000 residents, whose water would have been diluted by
uncontaminated supplies, were not informed until Thursday.
   Soon after the original findings, eight households using water
directly from the wells were told to boil their water before
drinking it, Yano said.
   He said the pollution is believed to have originated from an
industrial plant owned by the Toshiba Components Co., but an
investigation has not been completed.
   A plant official said that after being informed of the
contaminated wells, the plant offered to ``donate'' water
purification equipment worth an estimated $225,000. Some equipment
now is being tested.
   ``Our decision to donate the equipment does not mean that we are
accepting responsibility,'' said Katsuo Inami, head of the Toshiba
Components plant's General Affairs Division. ``By donating
equipment we hope to speed up efforts to determine the source of
the pollution.''
   But Inami said as far as he knew the plant was the only one in
the area using trichloroethylene and ``may have been a pollutant in
the past.'' The company has operated since 1967 and used the
chemical since 1972, he said.
   Hisashi Yano, an official with the Water Quality Bureau of the
Environment Agency, said although trichloroethylene ``has been
found by some to be a possible carcinogen, we cannot say for
certain whether it actually causes long- or short-term harm.''
   Trichloroethylene is used mainly as an industrial cleanser, but
is also used by dry cleaners.

<TEXT>
   Students at a tiny Ozark Mountains high
school who sued for a chance to dance say a judge's order means
they'll soon be getting footloose.
   ``We just want to have a casual, fun, first dance,'' said Purdy
High School student council president Nancy Fox, one of 21 students
who along with their parents sued the school board. ``I'm excited.''
   ``You can anticipate that a request will be made in the very
near future,'' said the students' attorney, William Fleischaker.
   U.S. District Judge Russell Clark on Thursday answered a request
by the board in Purdy that he clarify their responsibilities under
his Aug. 1 decision declaring their century-old dance ban
unconstitutional.
   ``The school board should treat student social dances in the
same manner as it treats other student activity on school
premises,'' Clark said.
   The judge said the school board can regulate the number of
dances and take steps to see that dances are chaperoned, but ``any
rules or regulations promulgated must not have the effect of
barring student social dances on school premise.''
   ``The court will not tolerate any attempt to circumvent the
meaning and spirit of the ... court order,'' he said.
   Repeated attempts to contact Attorney Ransom Ellis III, who
represented the board, by telephone were unsuccessful.
   The Purdy school system, centered in a town of about 900 people
50 miles southwest of Springfield, has about 520 students in all
grades. About 240 are in the six-year junior and senior high school.
   Residents say the dance ban has been part of the school board
policy book for 100 years. Senior classes at Purdy High School have
made an annual ritual of asking for a dance and being refused.
Proms and other dances have been held in neighboring towns or at
the Purdy community center.
   But the class of 1986 persisted in its quest for a school dance
with the lawsuit, petitions and a rally to which they invited stars
of ``Footloose,'' a movie about a fictional Texas town where high
school students fought a similar prohibition. Actors Kevin Bacon
and Lori Singer did not attend.

   A Vietnamese jetliner crashed and

Friday, an air force spokesman said.
   Air Vice Marshal Sommot Sundaravej said air force helicopters
rescued six people _ four men and two women. He said he had no
information on casualties or on how many people were aboard the Air
Vietnam flight from Vietnam's capital, Hanoi.
   The flight is often taken by foreign diplomatic staff or relief
workers, Sundaravej said.
   Sundaravej said Flight VN831 crashed in a rice field at Fa Kam
village at 11:37 a.m. (12:37 a.m. EDT). The Soviet-made TU-134
exploded into small pieces after impact, he said.
   According to Jane's All The World's Aircraft, various versions
of the twin-engine TU-134 seat from 80 to 96 people.

<HEAD>Bentsen Says Democrats Will Fight `Moral Deficit'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, is sharpening up his rhetoric as he and
Michael Dukakis fight back against Republican attacks that have
helped send their campaign sinking in the polls.
   Bentsen, who was heading to Iowa today for a speech in which he
planned to blast the GOP record on agriculture, told a gala
Democratic Party dinner in New York on Thursday night that he and
Dukakis would erase the ``moral deficit'' of the last eight years.
   With the help of record fundraising, including $5 million raised
at the Manhattan dinner alone, Democrats would be better able than
ever to deliver their message of ``hope,'' he said.
   ``The message is going to be `No' to the hate-mongering
disciples of the hard right,'' he said.
   ``The message is going to be `No' to the massive budget deficits
and trade deficits that have endangered America's economic
leaderhsip in the world.
   ``And the message is going to be `No' to the candidates who
impugn the loyalty and patriotism of others while hiding behind the
American flag,'' he said, a direct slap at Bush's criticism of
Dukakis, who, based on a court opinion that it was
unconstitutional, vetoed a Massachusetts law requiring the pledge
of allegiance in schools.
   Bentsen, speaking before New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and Dukakis,
was introduced by Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards, who was the
Democrats' keynote speaker at their convention in July.
   She got a roar from the crowd when she poked Bush for fumbling
the date of the attack on Pearl Harbor in a speech this week.
   ``Well, I told you he'd put a silver foot in his mouth,'' she
said. ``You see that one yesterday? I mean, I didn't even get shot
down, and I know when Pearl Harbor was.''
   After a warm reception, Bentsen continued the line. ``Alas, poor
George,'' he said, ``Ann Richards was born with a silver tongue in
his mouth.''
   ``Or as another Texan said,'' Bentsen added, ``George was born
on third base, and thinks he hit a triple.''
   The dinner, with 2,800 people paying at least $1,000 a seat, was
decidedly upbeat. But nationwide, the ticket is trailing the
Republicans by 51 percent to 42 percent, according to a new
Washington Post-ABC News poll.
   And despite the prominence of Bentsen and Richards, the
Democrats find themselves behind in the polls in Texas, which Bush
also calls home.
   Bentsen, who campaigned in Texas on Labor Day, was traveling to
California after Iowa this week. But Dukakis was visiting the state
today Friday and Bentsen planned to return next week to fight for
the state's prize of 29 electoral votes.

   Former Prime Minister U Nu on Friday said
he has formed a rival government and that general elections will be
held Oct. 9.
   The announcement by U Nu, ousted in the 1962 military coup, was
contained in a letter distributed to diplomatic missions.
   The letter, signed by the 82-year-old U Nu, unveiled a 25-member
government with himself as prime minister, former President Mahn
Win Maung as president and retired General Tin Oo as defense
minister.
   ``I have exercised my (constitutional) right at 9 a.m. this
morning. I have taken back the power which General Ne Win has
robbed from me,'' U Nu wrote. ``From this hour, sovereign power no
longer rests with General Ne Win. It has come back into my hands,
and I announce this fact with joy.''
   U Nu was toppled in a coup led by Gen. Ne Win, who held the
reins of power for the next 26 years. Although Ne Win official
retired as head of the ruling party last July, many analysts
believe he still exercises decisive control.
   Hard-line leader Sein Lwin was named to replace Ne Win, but he
resigned after 17 days and massive street protests that resulted in
at least 112 deaths. Maung Maung replaced Sein Lwin, becoming
Burma's first civilian leader in 26 years, but protests have
continued as opponents try bring about a multiparty system.

   Vice President George Bush's presidential
campaign asked three agencies to investigate a political action
committee that has spent $1.5 million so far to promote Bush and
blast his opponent.
   The latest expenditure by Americans for Bush, an arm of the
National Security Political Action Committee, is a $500,000
television ad campaign painting Democrat nominee Michael Dukakis as
soft on crime and criminals.
   Officials of the group said they would continue spending
lavishly on the vice president unless Bush campaign chairman James
Baker III asks them to stop.
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said the campaign has filed
complaints against the group with the Postal Service, the Internal
Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission.
   ``We are concerned about the name of the organization. It
connotes a connection with this campaign and the vice president.
There is no connection,'' Goodin said. ``We are also concerned
about their fundraising techniques and methods. There are a range
of complaints.''
   Some people have reported receiving as many as three mail
solicitations in the same day from Americans for Bush. Some
contributors, confused by the group's title and letterhead, have
said they believed they were giving money to the Bush campaign.
   NSPAC was formed in 1986 by chairman Elizabeth Fediay, retired
military officials and others. Fediay said the PAC has collected
$3.8 million since last year, including contributions to Americans
for Bush. She said anyone who wants a refund of their contribution
can get one.
   Fediay maintained that only middle-level Bush campaign staffers
have expressed concerns about NSPAC's activities, although Goodin
said Bush himself has asked that Americans for Bush change its name.
   Fediay said she was sending a letter to Baker seeking his view
of the group's independent activities on behalf of Bush. ``If he
asks me to stop advocating the election of George Bush, I will,''
she told reporters at a news conference called to unveil the
group's two latest ads.
   The new 30-second ads started airing Wednesday on national cable
networks and are to continue until Oct. 5 with appearances in
virtually every media market in the country.
   ``Dukakis not only opposes the death penalty, he allowed
first-degree murderers to have weekend passes from prison,'' a
narrator says in both ads.
   One spot goes on, ``Ten murderers on weekend passes have
escaped. One kidnapped and stabbed a Maryland man and raped his
fiancee. As president, George Bush will be as tough on criminals as
they are on us.''
   Leslie Dach, a Dukakis spokesman, said one way the governor
would respond to such attacks is by citing his record in
Massachusetts, where the crime rate has fallen during his tenure.
   Goodin said he was not familiar with the activities, ads or
media strategy planned by the group. The Bush campaign began its
own TV drive this week with sentimental spots showing Bush with his
family and at the Republican convention.

   PTL founder Jim Bakker said he will
withdraw his offer to buy the ministry's assets if he cannot
confirm funding from his backers today.
   ``It's time to fish or cut bait,'' Bakker said Thursday after
meeting with PTL Bankruptcy Trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton.
   Benton said Bakker has offered no proof he has the money to
carry out his $172 million bid. The trustee also met Thursday with
other potential buyers.
   In addition, Benton asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds
to extend from Saturday until Monday the deadline to present a
buyer, since Saturday is a weekend day. He said he expects to get
the extension.
   ``They did not show us anything (any documents) today,'' Benton
said after meeting with Bakker and his lawyers at PTL's offices.
   He said he would withhold judgment on whether he thinks Bakker
had the money, and would give him until 5 p.m. today to come up
with $3 million to secure his offer and to show proof that the
funds exist for the overall loan.
   Bakker, who resigned from PTL in March 1987 amid a sex-and-money
scandal, said he still is dealing with the investors he had
previously identified as 28 Greek businessmen. But he said Thursday
the investors are not necessarily from Greece and would identify
them only as Europeans.
   ``Somebody invented this Greek tycoon _ one of our beloved media
people _ and I went along with it because they wanted it so
badly,'' Bakker said.
   Bakker also said he is not concerned by reports that the
middleman he was using to talk to the investors has been convicted
of fraud.
   ``I'm very satisfied the money is not tainted,'' Bakker said.
   Louis M. Pihakis, identified as representing Greek financiers
backing Bakker's effort to buy back PTL, served prison terms for
mail fraud and other crimes during the 1970s.
   Pihakis has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached Thursday for comment.
   Bakker, who has been asking supporters for donations, said he
has more than $2 million now and ``it's still coming in.''
   ``I have agreed if we don't have confirmation of funds within
the next 24 hours ... we will withdraw our offer to purchase
Heritage USA and go back and regroup,'' Bakker said Thursday. ``I
feel like we need to bring this drama, at least this part of it, to
an end.''
   Benton also met with a group of investors he described only as
Canadian who are interested in bidding on PTL's Heritage USA
Christian theme park, satellite television network and undeveloped
property.
   He said the prospective bidder was not Canadian real estate
executive Peter Thomas, who had offered $113 million for the
ministry but withdrew Wednesday, saying he's ``just tired of
playing around.''
   Benton said Thomas is still ``waiting in the wings.''
   Bakker left PTL in March 1987 amid revelations of extravagant
spending and a sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn.
The ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization that June.

   Former Prime Minister U Nu, who was ousted
in a 1962 military coup, said Friday he formed a rival government
and that general elections will be held Oct. 9.
   Earlier, about 200 uniformed air force men fled to a university
campus and joined student leaders in the first major military
defection to protesters seeking to end one-party rule.
   The 82-year-old U Nu unveiled a 25-member government with
himself as prime minister, former President Mahn Win Maung as
president and retired General Tin Oo as defense minister. The
announcement was contained in a letter distributed to diplomatic
missions.
   ``I have exercised my (constitutional) right at 9 a.m. this
morning. I have taken back the power which General Ne Win has
robbed from me,'' U Nu wrote. ``From this hour, sovereign power no
longer rests with General Ne Win. It has come back into my hands,
and I announce this fact with joy.''
   U Nu was toppled in a coup led by Gen. Ne Win, who held the
reins of power for the next 26 years. Although Ne Win official
retired as head of the ruling party last July, many analysts
believe he still exercises decisive control.
   There was no immediate reaction from the military or from the
government to U Nu's announcement.
   ``We side with democracy and not with fascists!'' and ``Our
military training is not to shoot people!'' the defecting soldiers
shouted inside Rangoon University, the headquarters for student
revolt.
   The unarmed air force men, mostly sergeants and privates,
sneaked out of Base 502 in the capital's Mingladpon area. They said
the main gates were locked to prevent soldiers from leaving.
   The air force base, the country's largest, is about 15 miles
north of downtown Rangoon.
   The first group of about 150 soldiers arrived at the campus at
about 6:30 a.m. and others arrived later in smaller groups.
Students guarded the soldiers inside the dormitory.
   The revolt came one day after about 1 million people surged
through the city in a massive strike and protest.
   The march was largely peaceful, but sources said a mob killed
two men and a woman who gave poisoned ice water to several
demonstrators, including schoolchildren.
   Senior government officials, uniformed state factory workers,
Buddhist monks and Catholic nuns, housewives and a group of 200
blind people joined in the protests. About 200 homosexuals also
participated.
   Residents said more than 700,000 protesters marched in the
central city of Mandalay, 350 miles north of Rangoon, and in
Monywa, an important trading town 60 miles northwest of Mandalay.
More than 100,000 marched in Moulmein, the Mon State capital 50
miles southeast of Rangoon.
   A Western analyst in Bangkok said that despite the great show of
anti-government force, the top leaders appeared to be ``going ahead
with their own timetable'' of holding a special congress Monday to
pave the way for a referendum on Burma's future. He said the
powerful military also appeared to be basically intact despite some
defections and ``wavering''
   ``The opposition has been effective in getting people out on the
streets but ineffective in moving the government. It just can't
topple it over,'' the diplomat said.
   The diplomat cited reliable reports that in Rangoon and
elsewhere, the army has been trying to seize all food, fuel, and
other essential items to dig in for the long-term ``and let the
people starve.''
   The army commandeered all supplies two weeks ago in Mandalay,
the country's second-largest city and a major protest center, he
said.
   Thursday's protest was the largest since an estimated 1 million
marched in Rangoon on Aug. 24 in the biggest demonstrations since
the 1962 military coup.
   President Maung Maung lifted martial law in Rangoon and curfews
nationwide on Aug. 24. He announced the Burma Socialist Program
Party would meet Sept. 12 to consider organizing a referendum on
one-party rule.
   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19 as the country's first civilian
leader in 26 years. But protesters have rejected the party meeting
and demanded immediate formation of an interim government to
oversee a transition to democracy.
   Protesters blame the party's military autocracy for repression
and economic policies that transformed resource-rich Burma into one
of the world's poorest nations.
   Marchers waved banners and shouted slogans as they converged on
the downtown area Thursday. Buddhist monks who joined students to
lead the protests were joined by white-robed Catholic nuns and
brothers.
   Also participating were employees of the Parliament office and
the Bureau of Special Investigation, or civilian intelligence.
   Protesters held a noon memorial service and laid wreaths in
front of City Hall, where several demonstrators were shot dead by
security forces Aug. 8 in rioting against hard-line President Sein
Lwin. He was forced to resign four days later.
   Burma's turmoil mounted after students rioted in September 1987
to protest economic policies. They then led broader-based street
protests in March and June.
   Street riots flared anew after strongman Ne Win resigned July 23
after 26 years in power and the party chose Sein Lwin to succeed
him.
   The government said 112 people died in Rangoon in rioting
against Sein Lwin, who resigned after only 17 days. Diplomats
believe many more people were killed.

   Sheep farmer Roger Foster has come up with a new
must for this city's fashionable garden set _ ``yuppie'' dung sold
under the label Baa Baa Doo.
   ``We're selling it as fast as he can scoop it out,'' said Sharon
Bagby, owner of Highland Hardware, the exclusive distributor of Baa
Baa Doo.
   ``One woman bought some to give to her husband on Father's Day,
because he hadn't given her anything for Mother's Day,'' she said.
   So far, 150 five-pound buckets of the stuff have been sold at
$3.99 each, about 40 cents more than cow manure.
   Foster started raising sheep two years ago in suburban Conyers.
When the manure started piling up, he said, an entrepreneurial
light bulb went off in his head.
   ``There's no personality in a 40-pound plastic bag of cow
manure,'' he said.
   Foster has his competitors. Jim Murray sells a special blend of
chicken manure at Murray's Garden Center.
   ``People around here can afford the unusual,'' said Murray.
   ``Yuppie doo? That's hilarious,'' said Steven Hodges, a soil and
fertilizer agronomist for the University of Georgia Extension
Service. Manure is manure, he said, ``but if you can find a way to
market it, that's great.''
   Hodges said sheep manure ``has less nitrogen, potassium and
phosphorus levels than (manure from) pigs or dairy cows. About the
only animals they beat out are turkeys and rabbits.''

   ``I looked down and all these people were carting money in. It

   She said her party guests netted $187 while other beach-goers
fished out hundreds more.
   ``It's not that uncommon,'' lifeguard Mark Wicks said of the

   Gordon Reed, a marine safety officer, said a heat spell drew

   A Vietnamese jetliner crashed into a
field and exploded four miles short of Bangkok's airport Friday,
killing at least 60 people, an air force spokesman said.
   Air Vice Marshal Sommot Sundaravej said Air Vietnam flight 831
from Hanoi crashed into the rice field at Fa Kam village at 11:37
a.m. (12:37 a.m. EDT).
   Sommot said rescue workers retrieved 60 bodies from the
wreckage. He said six more people were seriously hurt.
   Communications Minister Montree Pongpanit said there were 90
people, including six crew members, aboard the flight. An official
of the Airport Authority of Thailand, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said there were 75 people aboard. There was no immediate
explanation for the discrepancy.
   Sommot said the dead included both Vietnamese and citizens of
other countries, but he did not have details. Usually, a fair
number of foreign diplomatic staff, relief workers and Vietnamese
living abroad take the flight.
   The plane that crashed was a Soviet-made TU-134 jet.
   According to Jane's All The World's Aircraft, various versions
of the twin-engine TU-134 seat from 80-96 people.
   The previous major airplane crash in Thailand was Aug. 31, 1987,
when a Thai Airways domestic airliner crashed into the sea off the
southern resort island of Phuket. All 83 people aboard died in the
crash of the Boeing 737, later blamed on errors by the pilot and
control tower.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharp slowdown in the growth of consumer
credit in July indicates Americans are showing caution despite wage
gains that month, an economist says.
   ``Consumers don't seem to be buying big-ticket items as they had
in the past and that probably reflects the increases in interest
rates,'' Mike Evans, head of a Washington economic consulting firm,
said,
   The government reported Thursday that consumer credit grew at a
4.8 percent annual rate in July, a sharp decline from the 10.2
percent rate for the first six months of the year.
   Americans took out $2.6 billion more in consumer credit than
they paid off in July, well down from the $8.1 billion they took
out in June, according to the Federal Reserve Board.
   The Federal Reserve has been tightening credit since late March
in an effort to dampen demand as a way of cooling inflationary
pressures.

Administrators says growing pressure to censor the books children
read is harming the education available to America's young people.
   ``Pressures that could result in censorship are increasing, and
that has an adverse effect on the ability of the schools to provide

   The group issued a report called ``Censorship and Selection:

   A House panel has approved a scaled-down
version of a Senate-approved bill authorizing a monument to
American women who served in the Vietnam War.
   The measure approved Thursday by the House Administration
subcommittee on libraries and memorials calls for a monument to the
10,000 American women who served in Vietnam to be built somewhere
on federal land in the Washington metropolitan area.
   A Senate bill, approved 96-1 in mid-June, specifies that a
bronze statue of an Army nurse be erected on the 2.2-acre grounds
of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which lists the names of the
58,000 men and women killed or missing in the Southeast Asian

   The vote on separate provisions will force votes by Congress on
a specific site and design for the monument, as well as review by

   Hundreds of radical students shouting
``Oppose divisive Olympics!'' battled riot police with firebombs
and rocks today in an anti-government and anti-Olympic
demonstration.
   Clashes broke out at Yonsei University in western Seoul when
riot police stopped about 600 students from marching off campus to
protest Thursday's arrest of a student leader.
   Police arrested the head of the students' association on charges
of having led an anti-Olympic campaign.
   Students armed with scores of firebombs, rocks and clubs
attacked riot police who responded with dozens of tear gas grenades
and returned rocks.
   Thousands of students remained indifferent inside the sprawling
campus as clashes continued for half an hour along the fences,
blocked off by about 1,000 riot police with plastic shields.
   At least five students were seen bleeding in their faces when
they were hit by stones. No arrests were reported.
   ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics suppressing democratic forces!''
the students shouted, accusing the government of using the Olympics
to perpetuate dictatorship and division of the Korean Peninsula.
   The students retreated to the campus after vowing to continue
their struggle until the release of the arrested student leader.
But students said they want to stage a peaceful campaign.
   Student leaders claimed the Olympics to be held Sept. 17-Oct. 2
in Seoul heightened the risk of war with communist North Korea,
which has decided to boycott the Games after its demand to be a
co-host was rejected.
   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, lack
public support.
   Also today, police ordered a crackdown on leaflets denouncing
the Olympics. Radical students have distributed leaflets in which
they demanded the Olympics be shared with North Korea to ease
tension and advance national unification.
   Police said security guards arrested a student volunteer at the
main Olympic stadium Thursday when the student was caught trying to
bring in about 100 anti-Olympic leaflets.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, police questioned 17 students
arrested Thursday night when groups of students staged sporadic
anti-government, anti-Olympic protests in downtown streets.
   Police maintain special contingents of riot police ready to move
around major campuses in Seoul, and security forces are posted
throughout Olympic venues to block possible terrorists.
   The Korean Peninsula was divided in 1945, after World War II.
Relations between the two sides remain tense, and they fought a
bloody war from 1950 to 1953.

<HEAD>Bush Campaign Fires Committee Co-Chairman After Complaints</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leader of a committee of George Bush's
presidential campaign has been dismissed amid accusations that he
and several other Bush volunteers have anti-Semitic backgrounds.
   Jerome Brentar, co-chairman of a committee trying to enlist
support among ethnic-Americans, was asked to resign Thursday after
it was learned he had defended a Cleveland autoworker convicted in
Israel as a Nazi war criminal, a Bush campaign aide said.
   ``We told him that his advocacy on this issue puts him at a
fundamental disagreement with the campaign and with the vice
president,'' said Mark Goodin.
   Goodin said Brentar belonged to a group that defended John
Demjanjuk, who is appealing a death sentence imposed after a court
in Jerusalem found him guilty of mutilating and killing inmates in
Nazi death camps during World War II.
   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and five other Jewish members
of the House held a news conference to charge that an ``ugly
assortment of anti-Semites and racists'' had been named to the Bush
campaign committee.
   Goodin later responded that Bush ``is very clear that there is
no place in any organization he is associated with for religious
bigotry or for anyone who would tolerate those views.'' He said the
backgrounds of members of the committee are being reviewed.

<HEAD>GOP Leaders Warn: Massachusetts Budget Could be $1.2 Billion Short</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican legislators say the state budget signed
by Gov. Michael Dukakis in July is out of balance by as much as
$1.2 billion because the governor is overestimating tax collections
and spending too much.
   ``The results are very sobering and very disquieting about the
future of this state,'' House Minority Leader Steven Pierce said
Thursday.
   Senate Minority Leader David Locke joined Pierce in calling once
again on Dukakis to demand that the legislature return to session
immediately to address the fiscal situation, auto insurance and
other concerns.
   Dukakis has touted the Massachusetts economy during his campaign
for the presidency.
   But Locke said, ``Based on our analysis, there is going to be a
shortfall that may exceed a billion dollars,'' and suggested
Dukakis and Democratic legislative leaders may be disguising
planned tax increases.
   Although the Legislature voted for the current $11.6 billion
budget in July and Dukakis does not have the power to
single-handedly summon the Legislature back to work, the
Republicans laid both problems at Dukakis' feet.

   Saying he made a mistake and was ``just
plain stupid,'' Sen. Gordon Humphrey apologized to congressional
candidate Betty Tamposi for saying her place was at home with her
two small children.
   ``In plain English, I made a mistake, I am sorry, and I
apologize,'' Humphrey said in a statement released by his Concord
office on Thursday.
   Humphrey unleashed a firestorm of protests _ both by Tamposi
supporters and foes _ on Tuesday when he said it was ``self-evident
that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in Congress and have time
left over for a child.''
   ``It's difficult enough being a father of a young child and a
member of Congress, as I am,'' said Humphrey, who has a 3-year-old
son. ``For the mother, who in our society is the primary care
giver, working 10-12 hours a day makes it impossible to give the
nurturing the child would need.''
   Humphrey suggested Tamposi was negligent to run for the House
with two daughters, ages 22 months and 4. Tamposi, a millionaire
officer in her father's real estate company, pays a nanny to care
for her children.
   On Thursday, Humphrey took it back even though he had insisted
for two days he would stand by his remarks.
   Humphrey apparently changed his mind after he got a call from
Chuck Douglas, Tamposi's strongest opponent in the 2nd District's
Republican primary on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says Tobacco Program `Makes Sense'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis, a non-smoker and public health devotee, said the federal
tobacco price-support program ``makes sense and I support it,'' as
long as it costs taxpayers nothing.
   The tobacco program, a traditional litmus test for politicians
in burley-growing Kentucky, is ``essentially a no-cost program,''
Dukakis said Thursday in an interview with The Associated Press.
   ``I think it's something that's important to ... lots of small
farmers in Kentucky and other tobacco-growing areas of this
country. Obviously, I'm concerned about public health as well. ...
But, on its present basis, (the program) makes sense and I support
it,'' Dukakis said.
   Under the program tobacco farmers pay a per-pound assessment,
set annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The money is
used to maintain a pool of tobacco stocks that fail to bring a
minimum, supported price at auction. Having their tobacco purchased
by the pool at least guarantees growers a minimum return.

<TEXT>
   A couple who filed a $100 million lawsuit
claiming that a hospital switched their healthy baby for one with a
fatal heart defect nine years ago say they hope medical records
will uncover their real daughter.
   Ernest and Regina I. Twigg allege that Florida hospital workers
changed identifying bracelets and altered records to give the
Twiggs' healthy baby to an adoptive family, then gave the Twiggs an
infant born the same day with a congenital heart defect.
   ``We're totally devastated,'' Mrs. Twigg told The (Baltimore)
Sun. ``Our lives have turned into a nightmare. We've not only lost
our Arlena ... but also where is our own daughter?''
   The couple raised Arlena Twigg as their own until she died in
August following surgery to correct the heart defect. Shortly
before her death, the lawsuit said, a blood test performed at Johns
Hopkins University here revealed that the child was not related to
either parent.
   The test showed Arlena had a blood type of B-positive. The
Twiggs said their baby had been born with a blood type of
O-positive, and they also both have type O blood.
   Additional tests on Arlena's tissues also concluded it would be
all but impossible for Arlena to be their child, said the couple's
attorney, Marvin Ellin of Baltimore.
   Mrs. Twigg later recalled that on the day her baby was born, a
nurse told her another woman on the maternity ward had also
delivered a daughter, which she intended to give up for adoption,
the suit said. Those were the only two girl babies in the ward at
the time, Ellin said.
   Mrs. Twigg said she told a nurse shortly before leaving the
hospital that the child she was nursing did not look like the same
baby she had nursed earlier in her stay, but the nurse dismissed
the notion.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tampa,
Fla., asks for hospital records that Ellin said could help the
Twiggs find out who adopted the girl. The attorney said he has also
contacted the FBI.
   The suit names Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula, Fla., three
physicians and a nurse, charging them with fraud or negligence, or
both.
   A woman who answered the telephone Thursday at the Twiggs' home
in Langhorne, Pa., referred calls to Ellin.
   The suit said that after the baby was born, the Twiggs were
originally told that she was healthy but three days later were told
she had congenital heart disease that could eventually prove fatal.
   One of the defendants, Ernest Palmer, a family doctor, told The
Sun, ``I certainly wouldn't switch babies on anyone, but I guess
you can be sued by anyone.'' Harold Connelly, hospital
administrator, said he had no knowledge of the suit and was
surprised by the allegations.
   Attempts by telephone to reach the other defendants _ Dr.
William D. Black, an obstetrician; Dr. Adley Z. Sedaros, a
pediatrician; and Dena E. Spieth, a nurse _ were unsuccessful.
   The suit said the unknown adoptive parents wanted a healthy baby
but it gave no reason why the medical personnel might have gotten
involved in switching two babies. Ellin said some defendants may
have been only negligent, but that at least one of them must have
deliberately switched the two babies' bracelets.
   The suit seeks records of payments to the defendants that might
give insight into motives as well as indicate where the other child
is living, Ellin said.

   The latest winner of the Miss America
swimsuit competition won't say if she's had cosmetic surgery, but
believes anything goes for women who want to make their bodies look
better.
   Miss Mississippi Carla Haag won the swimsuit event Thursday in
the second evening of preliminary Miss America Pageant competition.
   Miss Minnesota Gretchen Carlson took talent honors with a
spirited classical violin performance.
   They join the preliminary winners picked Wednesday, Miss
Louisiana Valerie Brosset in swimsuit and Miss Oklahoma Lori Lee
Kelley in talent. A final preliminary round is scheduled today,
with selection of a new Miss America on Saturday.
   Miss Haag declined to tell reporters if she'd had surgery to
enhance her 5-foot-6, 105-pound figure.
   The question came after pageant director Leonard Horn earlier in
the day criticized surgery or other unnatural preparations for the
pageant.
   Like Horn, Miss Haag said medical procedures and other
techniques, such as using tape to enhance breast size, were
inappropriate for competition.
   But she said, ``I think any thing is fair as long as it doesn't
hurt the contestant, as long as it doesn't hurt any other
contestant.
   ``If cosmetic surgery enhances you and you feel good about it
... and if that's something you want for yourself, not for the
competition, I think it's perfectly OK,'' Miss Haag added.
   Asked if she had undergone cosmetic surgery, she said, ``I
choose not to comment, thank you.''
   The 23-year-old from Hattiesburg, Miss., a graduate student in
psychology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, wore a
simple white swimsuit.
   Miss Carlson, meanwhile, played a spirited violin solo titled
``Gypsy Airs.''
   She wore a black velvet gown with a sweetheart neckline,
accentuated with green lame puffed sleeves and green lame pleated,
layered skirts.
   A confident Miss Carlson said afterward that she had expected a
strong showing with the talent she has developed for 17 years.
``I'm a born performer.''
   Miss Carlson, 22, from Anoka, Minn., is a senior majoring in
organizational behavior at Stanford University. After graduation,
she would like to enter graduate law studies, ``hopefully at

   Professors at Hofstra University returned
to the classroom after overwhelmingly ratifying a new contract
following a week-old strike.
   The professors approved the agreement Thursday by a vote of 160
to 51 with two abstentions, according to Michael D'Innocenzo,
spokesman for the local chapter of the American Association of
University Professors.
   University spokesman Michael DeLuise said classes resumed
Thursday night.
   According to DeLuise, the three-year contract provides for
raising faculty salaries about 8 percent in the first year, 7
percent in the second year and 6 percent in the third.
   The contract also includes a 25 percent reduction in teaching
loads of about half the faculty members, he said.
   The strike at the university on Long Island began Sept. 1 on the
fourth day of the new fall term.

   The family of a man discovered dead in his car
by police wasn't notified until three weeks later, when they
received a towing bill addressed to his estate, authorities said.
   George Wood, 47, of Middletown, N.J., was found dead in the
parking lot of a Harlem restaurant Aug. 19, two days after he was
reported missing, said New York Police Sgt. Ray O'Donnell. An
autopsy showed he died of a heart attack.
   The New York Police Department notified Monmouth County Sheriff
Department, a routine procedure through which the Middletown Police
Department would have then been notified and contacted the family,
O'Donnell said.
   But Middletown police chief Joseph McCarthy said his department
was never notified.
   On Wednesday, the family received a letter from the New York
Police Department addressed to the estate of George Wood, said his
nephew, Pat Esposito. The letter contained a notice that Wood's car
had been towed, he said.
   Esposito said it was the first the family had heard of Wood's
body or that his car had been found.
   Officials at the sheriff's office could not be reached
immediately for comment.

<TEXT>
   Floodwaters that inundated
three-fourths of the nation receded today, but officials said
sewage and rotting garbage dumped into the stagnant waters posed
new health threats to millions of people.
   The government said 609 people had died since the floods began
June 13. The government's count, hampered by poor communications
and bureaucracy, is generally considered low.
   Dhaka newspapers, which publish their own daily tallies,
reported 101 new deaths today, bringing the unofficial death toll
to 1,402.
   The Information Ministry said most of the victims either
drowned, suffered snake bites or were killed when their houses
collapsed.
   The government's Health Center said 93 people died of diarrhea
contracted from drinking muddy floodwater. It said it knew of
135,537 cases of diarrhea nationwide, including 8,254 reported in
Dhaka, the capital of this impoverished country.
   Mohammad Azad, public relations officer at the International
Center for Diarrheal Distress, said that since Tuesday the hospital
had received between 300 and 400 diarreha cases a day, double the
number reported when the floods began.
   ``The hospital is overcrowded, with patients being treated in
corridors and officers' chambers. We have no place for patients any
more,'' Azad said.
   An official at the Flood Control Center said major rivers had
stopped rising but that five northern and southern districts were
facing new floods. Monsoon-swollen rivers in northeastern India
flow through Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal.
   Health officials in Dhaka said that floodwaters combined with
sewage and rotting garbage posed another threat to the health of
the 6 million people in the capital.
   Nearly 40 million gallons of sewage and four tons of garbage
have been dumped into the stagnant water.
   The government has said at least 21 million of Bangladesh's 110
million people lost their homes in floodwaters that still range
from a few inches to at least 10 feet.
   Millions of people in the flooded areas or in relief camps do
not have enough food, drinking water or medicine.
   The Bangladesh Observer, an English-language daily, said 50,000
people marooned in Rupganj Upazila in Narayanganj district, about
20 miles south of Dhaka, were fighting ``a grim battle for their
survival as no relief material reached them yet.''
   The paper said many people were living on roofs and in trees.
   The country's two most influential opposition leaders,
meanwhile, accused the government of President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad of failing to ensure adequate rescue and relief operations.
   Sheikh Hasina and Kheleda Zia, who have been calling for
Ershad's ouster, claimed the government was obstructing relief
operations organized by political parties and volunteer
organizations in an effort to cover up mismanagement.
   Ershad has governed Bangladesh since seizing power in a
bloodless coup in March 1982.

   Pressure mounted on defiant city councilmen
to drop their opposition to a court-ordered housing desegregation
plan as fines approached a $1 million-a-day limit today and mass
layoffs of city workers loomed.
   Yonkers was fined $819,200 Thursday for continuing to defy the
desegregation plan. The penalties, imposed by U.S. District Judge
Leonard Sand, began at $100 a day and double daily, reaching a
total of $1,638,300 Thursday.
   Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko scheduled a council meeting for noon
today for a new vote on the housing plan. The fines were expected
to rise to $1 million a day, the cap imposed by an appeals court,
if the council refused to accept the plan.
   With the fines rapidly eating up the city's $337 million budget,
the city plans to lay off 447 library, planning and parks employees
Saturday, roughly one quarter of the city payroll. During the next
few weeks, virtually all city services will be terminated and all
city workers laid off.
   Sand is putting part of the city's fines in a trust to keep the
school system solvent. However, school started Thursday without
crossing guards on the streets.
   Wasicsko, who favors compliance with the housing desegregation
ruling, said, ``The tide of public opinion is turning and the
scenario only gets more Draconian from here.''
   ``It's a painfully slow process of the public's coming to that
awareness, but maybe that's the democratic way,'' he said. ``Maybe
the councilmen will come around once they face a public-relations
nightmare.''
   The People's Union, a 2,000-member citizens' group that has
supported the council's resistance, reversed itself and began
lobbying at City Hall for the council to give up.
   ``We woke up and smelled the coffee,'' Lucille Rizzetta-Lantz,
president of the group, said at a raucous council meeting Thursday.
``This can't continue. You can't have people losing their jobs. We
want one of the councilmen to change his vote, to prevent the city
from disaster.''
   Telephone calls urging the city to comply with the order clogged
the lines at City Hall.
   Some residents were upset that their garbage was not collected
because suppliers, worried about the city's finances, refused to
deliver diesel fuel this week.
   ``They can't go on like this,'' said William Brickwedell, 79.
``Right now, there's no garbage collection on my street. It's time
for integration.''
   At Thursday's meeting, the council voted 5-1 to transfer $73,000
to its judgments and claims account so the city could pay
Wednesday's fine of $409,600. Fines are paid the day after they are
incurred.
   Councilman Edward Fagan voted no and Henry Spallone abstained.
The two have been in the majority in the council's several 4-3
votes against the housing desegregation plan.
   ``This business of blaming us is not right,'' said Spallone. ``I
blame the judge, and I say to him, `If you want the money, come and
get it.'''
   His comment brought cheers from the spectators.
   Sand ruled in 1985 that the city had willfully segregated
housing and education for 40 years, the first time a court had
linked segregation in the two areas.
   The schools were desegregated under a plan approved by Sand. The
judge's housing order calls for the development of 1,000 units of
low- and moderate-income housing.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the city's appeal of
Sand's contempt of court ruling against the councilmen for defying
the order, but it has stayed fines and threatened jail sentences
pending a hearing on the councilmen's appeal.

   Whitney Ray Petersen hasn't been born yet,
but doctors are preparing to give him a new heart in an operation
performed only once before, officials say.
   The fetus carried by Cynthia Petersen, who is 33 weeks pregnant,
suffers from a lethal heart defect called hypoplastic left
ventricle, in which the left chamber of the heart does not develop.
   Mrs. Petersen and her husband, Daymon, who have selected Whitney
Ray as the name for their boy when he is born, said Thursday they
would fly to Loma Linda University Medical Center to await a
suitable donor heart.
   If an appropriate donor heart becomes available, the baby will
be delivered by Caesarean section and the heart will be
transplanted immediately.
   ``Baby Paul'' from Canada is the only other baby with
hypoplastic left ventricle to have had a transplant right after
birth. The baby was operated on at Loma Linda 11 months ago and is
growing normally, officials said.
   Mrs. Petersen's obstetrician found the abnormal fetal heart beat
during a prenatal examination and referred her to Dr. Greggory De
Vore, director of the Intermountain Fetal Diagnostic and Treatment
Center at LDS Hospital here.
   Most babies with the fetus's condition die within the first
three to four weeks of life, De Vore said.
   Twenty infants have undergone human heart transplants at Loma
Linda, and 16 are having healthy, normal childhoods, said hospital
spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   But De Vore said those were the ones lucky enough to find a
donor, and that half the babies die before a donor can be located.
   The Petersens hope to improve the odds by starting the search
before birth.
   ``We know there is only a 50 percent chance they will even
locate a donor, but we are optimistic,'' Petersen said.
   Because a newborn's immune system isn't developed, it ``is not
yet keyed in to reject a donor organ,'' and the transplant is more
likely to take, De Vore said, although rejection still is possible.
   The Petersens have a 5-year-old girl and a 2-year-old boy.
Petersen is a maintenance worker for the Utah National Guard and
Mrs. Petersen is a nurse.
   The couple said their insurance company will not cover the
$100,000-plus price tag of the surgery and they don't know how they
are going to pay it.

   Rain this morning threatened possible flooding in central and
northern Florida, and tropical storm Florence changed just slightly
in strength as it drifted slowly 365 miles south of New Orleans.
   Rain extended across Georgia and parts of the Carolinas, and
early morning skies were cloudy over the central Atlantic states
and the upper Mississippi Valley.
   The rest of the nation was partly cloudy or clear.
   Florence drifted northward at about 5 mph, and was expected to
continue in that direction about 12 hours.
   The tropical storm's highest sustained winds were about 55 mph
with gusts to near hurricane force in squalls.
   Today's national weather forecast called for showers and
thunderstorms extending from eastern Virginia across the Carolinas
to central Florida; Georgia, Alabama and eastern Mississippi.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 60s in upper Michigan and
the northern Pacific Coast; the 70s from the rest of Washington
state across northern Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, the Great
Lakes, the northern Appalachians and from New England across New
Jersey; and near 90 and in the 90s in the southern Plains, and from
the Great Basin across southern Oregon. Highs in the desert
Southwest likely will reach near 110 degrees.
   The rest of the nation should be in the 80s.
   The nation's temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 37 degrees
at Yellowstone, Wyo., to 91 at Blythe, Calif.

   Walter Hudson, who walked out of his
house for the first time in 18 years after losing an estimated 680
pounds in a year, says he dreams of helping other fat people slim
down.
   ``I got a lot to live for,'' the 520-pound Long Island man said
after he lumbered into the sunshine Thursday. ``I want to help a
lot of people, people who are overweight or on drugs.''
   Hudson, 43, weighed about 1,200 pounds a year ago.
   Wearing a light blue toga with pants and sunglasses to protect
his eyes, Hudson walked through a widened doorway and onto a
specially constructed, elevated concrete patio. He sat on a
concrete block with a vinyl cushion.
   ``It feels good,'' he said. ``I shouldn't have waited this
long.''
   Hudson's fear that his legs would not support his weight kept
him confined mostly to his bed since he was 15 years old. He made
headlines last fall when he became wedged in a doorway and had to
be rescued by firefighters with saws.
   Hudson said Thursday that frightening episode was a blessing
because it made him realize something had to be done.
   ``I would have kept eating more and more,'' he said. ``That fall
saved my life. It was a gift from God.''
   He lost several hundred pounds under a diet regimen directed by
comedian-turned-nutritionist Dick Gregory, but when Gregory wanted
to bring him to his clinic in the Bahamas, Hudson balked. He didn't
want to leave the house.
   Hudson pressed ahead with his own diet. He drank his own liquid
diet formula, which he plans to market some day. Every other day,
he consumes nothing but water; every three days, he eats garlic,
onions and apple cider.
   In an average week, he loses three pounds. He hopes to reach 190
pounds.
   Hudson has been aided by a medical team led by Barbara Rosen, a
psychologist specializing in eating disorders.
   ``I am very proud of what Walter has accomplished in such a
short period of time,'' said Rosen. ``He knows now that anything he
sets his mind to do, he can do.''
   Hudson's goal is to visit his mother's grave in a cemetery a few
blocks from the small house he shares with his relatives.
   ``Mama knows I'm coming to see her,'' he said. ``It won't be
long now.''

   The dollar changed little in light European
trading early today. Gold rose slightly.
   Dealers expected the dollar to trade within a narrow range at
least until release of the U.S. Producer Price Index, which
measures wholesale prices and is an important indicator of
inflation.
   Some dealers said the dollar could be boosted if producer prices
rise more than 0.5 percent and rekindle fears of a further rise in
interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 1.25 Japanese yen to a closing 132.95 yen.
Later, in London, it moved back up to 133.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday:
   _1.8445 West German marks, down from 1.8485
   _1.5590 Swiss francs, down from 1.5600
   _6.2840 French francs, down from 6.3025
   _2.0815 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0855
   _1,378.50 Italian lire, down from 1,384.50
   _1.2390 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6985 from $1.6940 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $428.85 a troy ounce, up
from $428 bid late Thursday. At mid-morning Friday, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $428.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428.85, up from $428.50 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold edged up 4 cents to close at a bid
$430.55.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.63 a troy
ounce, up from $6.58 bid late Thursday.

   Iran raised the possibility that the stalled peace
talks with Iraq could be suspended and shifted to New York, the
first public indication by either side that a break is near in the
2-week-old negotiations.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran charged at a news
conference Thursday that Iraq tried to ``derail the discussions''
by introducing ``extraneous elements'' on the first day of talks
Aug. 25.
   He said the Tehran government agreed in principle _ ``with small
reservations'' _ to a compromise formula proposed by U.N. mediator
Jan Eliasson in an effort to move the talks ahead but that Iraq
refused to accept it. Velayati refused to elaborate on the proposal.
   There was no response from Iraqi officials. Iraq and Iran have
engaged in indirect peace talks all but one day since Aug. 25.
   In an interview with Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency, Velayati also accused the Iraqis of repeating past matters
``without showing the slightest cooperation and flexibility'' with
U.N. mediators.
   Asked at the news conference if he foresaw an early adjournment
of negotiations and a shift of venue to New York, he said:
   ``Yes, I think. It will start in maybe two or three weeks from
now, but the ending of this round of talks depends on the decision
of the (U.N.) secretary-general.''
   The talks are aimed at a lasting peace settlement after the
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war took
effect Aug. 20.
   The timing of the next round probably would coincide with
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar's presence in New York
for the U.N. General Assembly, opening Sept. 20.
   Perez de Cuellar personally mediated the first week of Iran-Iraq
talks, then named Eliasson, a Swedish diplomat, as his special
representative.
   The U.N. chief said Wednesday the talks were blocked and that no
quick solution was in sight.
   Velayati said Iran was ready to pursue peace efforts and to
resume face-to-face meetings, which were held only on the first two
days of talks.
   The London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror quoted Velayati in an
interview as urging third parties, including neighboring gulf Arab
states, to persuade the Baghdad government to ``confine the peace
talks to the agenda.''
   In Geneva, Velayati said Iraq deviated from the basis for the
talks, laid out mainly in a U.N. cease-fire resolution, by
demanding discussion of free navigation and the clearing of the
disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms the countries'
southern border.
   Iran has consistently said these points should be dealt with
later.
   Velayati said clearing Shatt-al-Arab could not be discussed
before the forces of both sides withdraw to internationally
recognized borders.
   The problem is that Iran still considers valid a 1975 treaty
setting the Iran-Iraq border down the middle of Shatt-al-Arab,
Iraq's major sea outlet. Iraq has renounced the pact and claimed
the entire waterway.
   Shatt-al-Arab has been blocked by sunken ships almost since the
war began in September 1980 and has also become silted.

   Coretta Scott King can sue Boston University for
thousands of documents Martin Luther King Jr. gave the school, but
will have to explain why she waited 23 years to seek her late
husband's papers, a judge ruled.
   In a ruling made public Thursday, Suffolk Superior Court Judge
John L. Murphy Jr. said a 1964 letter by King bequeathing the
papers to BU is not a formal will, giving Mrs. King the right to
pursue her claim.
   A lawyer for Mrs. King, James O'Brien, said he was pleased with
the decision and would soon file a motion requesting a trial.
   Attorney Melvin Miller, a member of the BU Board of Trustees,
said Murphy's decision never touched on who should own the papers.
   The ruling dated Aug. 31 is the latest development in a legal
battle launched by Mrs. King in December. She wants the 83,000
documents held by BU transfered to the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta, which holds
100,000 other King documents.
   The BU collection represents about one-third of King's surviving
documents and correspondence.
   A key issue in a trial, Murphy said, would be ``whether the
23-year delay in instituting this action was unreasonable and
resulted in some injury or prejudice to BU.''
   O'Brien said he was confident the question of any harm to BU in
the delayed filing of the claim can be easily handled. ``Boston
University has not been harmed in any way. It's actually benefited
by having the papers all this time,'' he said.
   The judge also rejected a counterclaim by BU to ownership of the
King papers stored in Atlanta.
   Miller labeled the decision ``very spurious,'' and said
university attorneys haven't decided whether to appeal.
   O'Brien said he was pleased the counterclaim was rejected.
``That's 90 percent of the case behind us in our favor,'' he said.
   Mrs. King is on vacation and was not available for comment.
   In the one-page, typewritten letter dated July 16, 1964, King,
who received his doctorate in theology from BU in 1955, wrote, ``In
the event of my death, all such materials deposited with the
university shall become from that date the absolute property of
Boston University.''
   The judge said BU was the rightful holder of the papers at the
time of King's death in April 1968, but agreed with Mrs. King's
argument that the letter didn't constitute a formal will.
   Mrs. King's suit claims the collection is not properly displayed
or preserved at BU.
   Some of the disputed documents are on display in the BU library.
Most of the collection, which is available to researchers and
scholars, is contained in 126 boxes in a climate-controlled room.

   A storm that triggered floods across central
Florida, causing at least six deaths and the evacuation of 1,000
people, threatened homes and lives as it headed north today,
officials said.
   ``Tampa should be breaking out of the rain ... but north of
Tampa they could still get some pretty substantial rain,'' National
Weather Service meteorologist Randy Lascody said in Miami.
   The storm has swamped the Gulf Coast with up to 15 inches of
rain since Sunday, causing more than $1 million in damage in
hard-hit Manatee County, where a state of emergency was in effect.
   The weather service issued a flash-flood watch for Gulf and
Franklin counties in the Florida Panhandle.
   A wave of showers moving north from the Gulf of Mexico was
expected to settle over northern Florida and southern Georgia by
tonight, Lascody said, adding that ``the real heavy stuff'' should
be heading up the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Gov. Bob Martinez was to tour the stricken Bradenton area of
Manatee County by Florida Air National Guard helicopter today to
decide whether the area should be declared eligible for state
disaster relief money.
   The rising waters left two dead on the west coast. A 44-year-old
Tampa man was presumed drowned after his car plunged into a ditch
and he was sucked into a pipe near downtown Tampa. In New Port
Richey, a 2-year-old boy drowned in a rain-swollen canal.
   The storm also contributed to a small plane crash Wednesday that
killed all four aboard near Williston about 110 miles north of
Tampa, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Ron Bird
said Thursday.
   The rainfall far surpassed the 5 inches dumped by Hurricane
Elena on Labor Day 1985, when wind and high tides did $9 million
damage and sent 13,000 people to shelters.
   In St. Petersburg, hundreds of mostly elderly residents
mistakenly thought the latest flooding was a hurricane.
   ``This is insane,'' Pinellas County Emergency Management
director David Bilodeau said. ``There's just been gross panic for
no reason at all.''
   A tornado struck St. Petersburg Thursday night, causing more
than $20,000 damage to six houses but no injuries, fire officials
said.
   Manatee County commissioners allowed half of the 1,000 evacuees
to return home Thursday as floodwaters began to recede.
   Residents returning home were urged by county public health
officers to disinfect sinks and showers, pitch out any food touched
by flood waters and check wells for broken pipes or flooding.
   Authorities warned about 300 people staying in shelters Thursday
to wait one more day while emergency officials tried to resolve
problems with raw sewage, water 5 feet deep in homes along the
Manatee River and power failures in homes with standing water.

   Michael Dukakis heads south today, having
fattened the Democratic Party's coffers by $5 million while
acknowledging he faces ``formidable odds'' in his quest for the
White House.
   ``I won't kid you, this is not going to be an easy 60 days,''
Dukakis said at a black-tie fund raiser Thursday.
   Dukakis, whose campaign has been sinking in the polls since the
Republican National Convention last month in New Orleans, heads for
that city today, after first making a couple of stops in Texas.
   The Democratic presidential nominee was planning to stop first
at East Texas State College in Greenville, alma mater of the late
House Speaker Sam Rayburn, then address a convention of Baptist
ministers in Dallas.
   Thursday's fund-raiser, where supporters paid a minimum of
$1,000 each to attend, raised more than $5 million for the
Democratic Party, said Robert Farmer, in charge of raising money
for the Dukakis campaign.
   The Dukakis campaign so far has raised $30 million of its $50
million goal for the national party, Farmer said.
   The party can spend that money on activities related to the
election, such as drives to get out the vote.
   Dukakis also met briefly Thursday with Jesse Jackson, who was
among four of the unsuccessful Democratic presidential hopefuls
attending the dinner at a Manhattan hotel.
   The two men chatted for a few minutes as Jackson walked by
Dukakis' table in the hotel ballroom. The substance of the
discussion was not disclosed.
   The other former candidates at the event were Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt and former Arizona
Gov. Bruce Babbitt.
   Before the meeting, Jackson told reporters his support for the
ticket has not wavered since the Democratic convention in July, but
he said that the nominee's message was not getting through.
   ``I do know that we have a good message that needs to be an even
sharper message,'' Jackson said. ``If you write with the same
pencil for a long time sometimes the message gets blurred.''
   Dukakis, who said earlier in the day he was not worried about an
ABC-Washington Post poll showing him trailing Republican nominee
George Bush 51 percent to 43 percent, told his supporters the weeks
ahead will have ``good polls and not so good polls.''
   ``We are facing determined adversaries and formidable odds,''
Dukakis said.
   Dukakis was joined on the stage by his running mate, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas.
   The tuxedos in Manhattan contrasted sharply with the T-shirts
and coveralls Dukakis encountered earlier Thursday at a General
Motors Corp. engine assembly plant at Tonawanda, N.Y.
   Dukakis strolled along the assembly line, shaking hands with the
workers, pausing briefly to cock his elbow atop a cart of fuel
injectors and talk.
   Later, with American flags and racks of completed V-6 engines
serving as a backdrop, Dukakis addressed a small but friendly crowd
of plant employees.
   He reminded them of a remark Bush made during a visit to the
Soviet Union, when he said workers there could come to the United
States to give Americans a lesson in quality.
   ``Those Republicans in Washington love to blame American workers
first,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wallop Rejects White House Assurances, Calls For Park Service
Firing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The senior Republican senator from
flame-ravaged Wyoming insisted today that the Reagan administration
dismiss the head of the National Park Service over the
controversial policy that allowed fires to burn unhindered for
months in the West.
   Sen. Malcolm Wallop repeated his call for Park Service Director
William Penn Mott's dismissal despite a White House spokesman's
statement Thursday that, ``We have no plans to fire anybody.''
   Wallop, speaking on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program,
said comments by Mott and other officials responsible for
maintaining the nation's forests have deeply harmed the morale of
those battling millions of acres of Western fires.
   ``Again, I would say Director Mott has reason to offer his
resignation,'' Wallop said in the interview.
   ``Their efforts to persuade the people of Wyoming and others
that they are doing what they can to control these fires are
completely undermined by the actions of Director Mott,'' said
Wallop.
   Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, before leaving today with
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel for a tour of the burning lands,
said the policy of allowing natural fires to burn out has been
abandoned since July.
   And Lyng insisted on CBS-TV's ``This Morning,'' ``I don't think
there's going to be anyone fired.''
   ``In fairness I think these people have done what anyone
objectively looking at it would have to say a tremendous job of
trying to bring this very difficult situation under control,'' he
said.
   The calls for Mott's resignation came from Capitol Hill
Wednesday, and President Reagan moved to quell the discontent by
dispatching Hodel, Lyng and Deputy Defense Secretary William H.
Taft IV today to survey the damage.
   Almost all of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming has been
closed because of fires that have burned 1.2 million acres.

   A former nightclub owner and his ex-bodyguard
have arrested in a gruesome, 7-year-old set of slayings for which
authorities unsuccessfully prosecuted the late porn star John
``Johnny Wadd'' Holmes.
   The 1981 bludgeoning deaths of four people in a home in rustic,
upscale Laurel Canyon, down the road from a home owned by then-Gov.
Edmund G. Brown Jr., have been one of the city's most notorious
unsolved murder cases.
   Adel Nasrallah, known as Eddie Nash, 59, of Tarzana, and Gregory
DeWitt Diles, 40, were charged Thursday with four counts of murder
and one of attempted murder. The charges carry the possibility of
the death penalty.
   They were arrested Wednesday and held without bail for a court
appearance Sept. 19.
   Holmes, a film star who claimed thousands of sexual conquests on
and off screen, was the only person tried in the slayings. He was
acquitted. Holmes died of AIDS in March.
   He never took the witness stand, and his subsequent testimony
before a grand jury remains sealed. But his former wife, Sharon,
told The Los Angeles Times earlier this year that Holmes had
confessed his role in the killings to her less than three weeks
after the crimes.
   Shortly before his death, Holmes was questioned again by
authorities, but Deputy District Attorney Dale Davidson said the
actor did not lead prosecutors to the unspecified new evidence that
he said resulted in Thursday's charges.
   ``We are going on the same theory as we did then, that the
murders were a retaliation for a drug robbery some 48 hours before
the murders,'' he said.
   Prosecutor Ronald S. Coen alleged at Holmes' trial that Nash,
who owned several nightclubs, ordered the killings in revenge for a
robbery at his home.
   Coen said Holmes led the killers to the Laurel Canyon house on
orders from Nash, who supplied drugs to Holmes.
   Nash wasn't tried at the time because of insufficient evidence,
said police investigator Tom Lange. Diles was arrested in 1981 but
released for lack of evidence.
   Nash's attorney, Paul Caruso, speculated that authorities
probably were pressured to bring charges and that the political
ambitions of District Attorney Ira Reiner played a part.
   ``I think Mr. Reiner has his eyes set on higher goals. I think
we'll see him declare for attorney general,'' Caruso said.
   Slain were William DeVerell, 42; Joy Audrey Miller, 46; Barbara
Richardson, 22, and Ronald Launius, 37. His wife, Susan Launius,
survived a severe beating but was unable to identify her attackers.

<HEAD>Taiwan Inaugurates Ferry Service To China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KEELUNG, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sailors set off firecrackers and
passengers threw colorful streamers to shore as a luxury liner
pulled out of this northern port today in the first ferry service
between archrivals Taiwan and China.
   Many of the 68 Taiwanese passengers bound for Shanghai on the
Excelsior Neptune are visiting the Chinese mainland for the first
time since Taiwan's Nationalist government eased a four-decade-old
travel ban to China last year.
   Tsao Cheng-chih, president of the Excelsior Marine Transport
Inc., said the passengers would disembark at Okinawa early Saturday
and transfer to the Excelsior Mercury for the remainder of the
three-day journey to bypass the Nationalists' ban on direct
shipping links with China.
   ``We have been waiting for this sea voyage for months. It is
really convenient,'' said King Ta-wei, a clerk who left his native
Shanghai 42 years ago.
   King and his wife carried dozens of mooncakes, a traditional
snack of the Chinese Moon Festival that falls on Sept. 25, and
winter clothes as gifts for relatives.
   Among the passengers were 13 reporters, including a four-member
television crew, and about 30 retired servicemen, who came to
Taiwan in 1949 when the Chinese Nationalists fled the mainland
after losing a civil war to communist forces.
   ``I am anxious to know how my cousins are,'' said Wang Shi-wei,
a 65-year-old army veteran, who said he was excited at returning to
his hometown in northeastern Shandong province.
   More than 150,000 Taiwan residents have visited China since the
travel ban was eased in October to allow family reunions, first
flying to Hong Kong or other intermediate points because direct
travel remains forbidden by the Nationalist government.
   Shanghai is 370 miles northeast of Keelung, but the trip will
cover more than twice that distance because of the Okinawa stop.
   The Nationalists still ban official contacts with China but
decided at a July party congress to gradually open up more civilian
exchanges, such as allowing Chinese to visit sick relatives in
Taiwan.
   An 80-member Taiwanese and Philippine crew was aboard the liner,
which can carry 330 passengers, Tsao said. He blamed a poor
advertising campaign for the small number of passengers on the
maiden voyage.
   Tickets cost $517 for economy cabins and $590 for first-class
cabins. The 5,070-ton Soviet-made liner, which the Taiwan company
purchased through Hong Kong brokers earlier this year, features a
pool, music hall and bar.
   The Taiwan visitors will be welcomed by Shanghai city officials
and residents when the line arrives Monday, Tsao said.
   The liberal Liberty Times hailed the ferry service, which will
run once every four days, as a move that ``opens the door for
shipping exchanges across the Taiwan Straits.'' It said many
leading Taiwanese businessmen have visited various Chinese ports to
arrange for other ferry services.
   A Ministry of Communications official, Tony Tung, said the
liner's voyage to Okinawa was approved by Keelung Harbor Bureau
authorities because ``we consider it a regular shipping service
between two international ports. We don't question where and how
the passengers are trans-shipped after Okinawa.''
   Three other companies plan to inaugurate indirect passenger
ferry services to China later this month. On Saturday, the
Tokyo-based Naha Holiday Travel Center sent two liners, carrying
about 300 Taiwanese, from Keelung to the eastern Chinese coastal
city of Xiamen (Amoy) via Okinawa.

<HEAD>Pravda Acknowledges Trotsky's Role in Russian Revolution</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOHN THOR-DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pravda today acknowledged for the first time in
decades that Leon Trotsky played a key role in the Russian
Revolution, but it said Lenin considered him a ``Judas.''
   For decades, Trotsky's name has been virtually banned from the
Soviet state-run press and his role in the creation of the world's
first socialist state virtually wiped from the historical record.
   The article in the government daily was an excerpt from a
biography of Josef Stalin being written by Col. Gen. Dmitri
Volkogonov. The biography described Trotsky in language that,
during Stalin's rule, might well have cost its author his life.
   ``Being quite a gifted publicist, speaker and organizer, Trotsky
played a well-known role in the October armed uprising and
eventually in the Civil War years when he was people's commissar
for military and naval affairs and chairman of the Revolutionary
Council,'' Pravda quoted the biography as saying.
   The words used to describe Trotsky would have been unimaginable
in the pages of the Communist Party daily as recently as a year
ago. Their publication in Pravda indicated high-level party support
for a reexamination of Trotsky.
   Although recognizing Trotsky's abilities and his deeds on behalf
of the revolution, the article noted that Vladimir Lenin, the
leader of the Bolsheviks, had called Trotsky a ``Judas'' in 1911.
   The headline of the full-page Pravda article called Trotsky
``the demon of the revolution,'' indicating that a full-blown
return to official favor is unlikely.
   By the time he was murdered in exile in Mexico City in 1940,
Trotsky's image had been cut or airbrushed from archive photographs
of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and he was portrayed in official
histories solely as a revolutionary turncoat who opposed both Lenin
and Stalin.
   As part of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for
``glasnost,'' or increased openness on some issues, Soviet
historians have been more frankly assessing their country's past,
including the role of Stalin foes like Nikolai Bukharin, Lev
Kamenev and Trotsky.
   In a major Kremlin speech last November, Gorbachev credited
Stalin with preventing a tae-over of the Communist Party by Trotsky
and his supporters in the late 1920s, and said Stalin was defending
the orthodox line set down by Lenin.
   But since then, the official state-run press has stepped up its
attacks on the bloody legacy left by Stalin's 29 years in power,
including a system of political and economic control based on
terror and purges in which millions died.
   ``During the years of revolution and Civil War, the most popular
leader after Lenin was Trotsky,'' the article said. ``There are
grounds to consider that Trotsky, during the years of his most
active participation in party life (1917-24), was not an enemy of
the revolution and of socialism. But already at that time, he was
an enemy of Stalin.''
   That phrasing is at odds with the way the Soviet press depicted
Trotsky for decades: as a turncoat and traitor to the working class
and to the revolution.
   Before Lenin died in 1924, he called Trotsky and Stalin
outstanding Communist Party officials but drew the attention of the
party to the ``serious negative personal qualities'' of both men,
the article said. ``The struggle between them became one of the
most dramatic pages of our history,'' it added.
   After Lenin's death, the article said, the Soviet founder's
appraisal of Trotsky as a ``self-confident, perennially dodging and
shifting and tricky politician became confirmed.''
   After being expelled from the party and the country, Trotsky
``slipped down to anti-Soviet and anti-Marxist positions,'' the
Pravda article said.

   An American witness testified
today that Mohammed Ali Hamadi appeared to be the leader of the
1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and that Hamadi said throughout
the ordeal, ``One American must die.''
   The witness, Kurt Carlson, 41, of Rockford, Ill., testified in a
heavily guarded Frankfurt courtroom that Hamadi severely beat him
with an iron bar and left him for dead. ``I prayed to God that he
would take my life before the hijacker came back to shoot me,''
Carlson said.
   Hamadi has acknowledged during his trial on air piracy and
murder charges that he was one of the hijackers but insisted he was
not the leader.
   Carlson was among 39 Americans held hostage for 17 days aboard
the jetliner after it was seized and diverted to Beirut on June 14,
1985. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed by the hijackers.
   ``It was very apparent to me from the beginning that Hamadi was
in charge,'' Carlson said as he described the hijacking ordeal for
the court. ``I assumed he was in charge since he gave the orders.''
   Carlson said the first words by the hijackers after they seized
TWA flight 847 were: ``Americans die, come to die.''
   The former hostage said the slogan was shouted by Hamadi's
fugitive accomplice, identified by the prosecutors as Hassan
Ezzeddine.
   Carlson said he was returning on the plane to the United States
from a week of reserve military duty for the U.S. Army in Egypt. He
said ticketing agents told him he got the last available seat in
Athens.
   Carlson said he was sitting in the first-class section and had
left his official red passport in his coat in a closet in the
section.
   After Hamadi found Carlson's passport, Carlson said he stood up.
   ``Hamadi took his gun and put it to my forehead. It was cocked.
He had his finger on the trigger. Hamadi said in English `CIA or
FBI?'''
   Carlson said he then explained to purser Uli Derickson that he
was a member of the Army reserve. Hamadi then told him to sit down.
   Carlson said that when the plane landed in Algiers the first
time ``Hamadi put the gun behind my ear and took me to the
first-class compartment.''
   He said Hamadi then tied his hands behind his back with a
necktie, put a handkerchief over his eyes, pushed him into the
cockpit and threw him on the floor. He said Hamadi talked to the
pilot, and Carlson said he could hear that there was difficulty in
the negotiating with the tower on refueling.
   ``Hamadi was screaming in Arabic and was hitting me on the
shoulders with the arm of the seat of the flight engineer,''
Carlson said. ``I began to pray, he (Hamadi) began to kick me. He
would jump up and down and kick.''
   ``He screamed `Marine' as he was kicking me,'' said Carlson.
``Then he set a deadline for my life. Fifteen minutes,'' said
Carlson.
   Hamadi several times extended the deadline for refueling with
the tower, Carlson said. He said Hamadi became more and more
agitated as the negotiations dragged on.
   ``Angry, he said in English `One American must die,''' Carlson
said. ``Suddenly I heard him scream `Marine' and I felt a metal bar
come down on my head twice. I knew that third blow would be the
death blow, because I heard him climb on a console.''
   Carlson said he managed to roll slightly on the floor and did
not take the full force of the blow.
   ``Hamadi then kicked me in the jaw to see if I was alive.''
   Carlson said that Hamadi then dragged him to the front passenger
door, opened the door, ``and with the gun at my head, extended the
deadline for another 10 minutes.''
   Hamadi then went back to the cockpit, and Carlson said he lost
feeling from the waist up and started to cough up blood. ``At that
point I felt that I'd certainly die within 10 minutes,'' Carlson
said.
   Carlson said that after the hijacking was over, stewardess Uli
Direckson told him that after the deadline passed ``Hamadi came
back to kill me, but both she and Hamadi thought I was already
dead.''
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport in 1987 after
explosives were discovered in his luggage.

   The death toll in last month's
Ramstein air show disaster climbed to 59 when three more people
died, including a young girl, officials said today.
   The state government spokesman, Juergen Dietzen, said two West
German men in their 40s died and ``the third was a 5-year-old
German girl.''
   More than 20 people remained hospitalized in critical condition.
   The disaster occurred Aug. 28 at the U.S. Air Force base in
Ramstein when three Italian stunt-flying jets collided at a low
altitute and one of them hurtled into a crowd of spectators and
exploded.
   Fifty-two Germans, two Americans, one person each from France
and the Netherlands, and the three Italian pilots died in the
disaster.
   Ramstein Air Base is located in Rhineland-Palatinate in the
southwestern part of the country. In Bonn, a committee of
Parliament met today to seek the causes of the tragedy, and to
determine who was responsible.

<TEXT>
   Turks are expressing concern over
long-term problems that may have been caused by allowing about
60,000 Kurdish refugees fleeing Iraq to enter Turkey in the past
week.
   Primary concern is over security at a time when Turkey slowly
has been gaining the upper hand in a war of attrition against its
own band of Kurdish guerrillas known as the Kurdish Labor Party.
The Marxist group aims to set up an independent state in the
southeast provinces.
   Intelligence and military officials fear that members of the
party, often denied sanctuary or assistance by Turkey's Kurdish
minority of 10 million in the region, can now find a safe haven to
organize and recruit in the new refugee camps near the border.
   Today, the Foreign Ministry denied reports that several thousand
Kurdish refugees given sanctuary in Turkey had later been forced to
go to Iran.
   ``It is out of the question to send any of the refugees to
another country against their will. We categorically deny these
reports,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Nazim Belger said.
   On Sunday, the leftist Istanbul daily Cumhuriyet quoted a local
opposition politician in Semdinli township near the Iraqi border as
saying that 4,000 to 5,000 Kurdish refugees had been sent to Iran
against their will.
   The report was later picked up by foreign news media.
   Security forces are taking precautions to prevent infiltration
of the camps by the Kurdish Labor Party, regional governor Hayri
Kozakcioglu has said.
   Since 1984, about 700 people have died in clashes between
Turkish government forces and the guerrillas.
   Local residents feel Turkey's acceptance of the refugees, who
have relatives or other ties in Turkey, will win the loyalty of the
country's Kurds and reduce any motivation to cooperate with the
Kurdish Labor Party.
   ``All action against the government must now stop because of the
goodness shown our ethnic brothers,'' said Selim Kaya, a driver
from the Hakkari province where the refugee influx was centered.
   While the security problem was being debated over the past two
days, guerrillas killed eight soldiers and one police officer. Five
rebels were slain by the army.
   Another possible problem stemming from the admission of the
refugees could be the deterioration of Turkey's relations with
Baghdad, diplomats and officials say.
   Throughout the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, Turkey maintained good
relations with both sides, meeting their export needs but refusing
to sell arms.
   Iraq sees the Kurdish guerrillas as traitors who sided with the
enemy and attacked them when they were engaged with Iranian forces.
Seen in that context, Turkey's admission of the refugees can be
seen as rendering aid to the enemy.
   The refugees include many guerrillas. According to reports from
the border area, several thousand already have crossed into Iran,
from where they are likely to slip back into Iraq to fight again.
Iran has been supporting the guerrillas.
   Iraq launched its offensive against Kurds fighting for autonomy
in northern Iraq soon after Iran agreed to a U.N.-sponsored
ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war. The cease-fire began Aug. 20.
   Iraq has declared amnesty for the Kurds, reportedly at Turkey's
urging, but Kurdish leaders have already said they will not accept
the promised pardon.
   ``The Kurds have not struggled to be pardoned but to achieve
their national and democratic rights within autonomy,'' said
Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish Democratic Party, one of
the major rebel groups in Iraq. ``Our struggle will continue until
these goals are fulfilled.''
   The refugees, originally spread along a 60-mile stretch of land
a few miles from the Iraqi border, are being resettled in tent
cities set up at five locations in Diyarbakir, Mardin and Hakkari
provinces.
   Protecting the refugees against the cold, feeding them and
providing for medical and other needs will severely strain Turkey's
resources which are scarcely sufficient for its own population in
the backward eastern region, commentators in Turkish newspapers
said.
   ``Do not be surprised if the condition of the camps one day is
criticized as `cruelty of the Turks' by some imaginative
anti-Turkish groups in Western Europe,'' columnist Hasan Pulur
wrote Thursday in the independent daily Milliyet.

   Attorney Gloria Allred wants Saks Fifth
Avenue to tailor a new policy for alterations on clothes, saying
the store discriminates against women.
   Ms. Allred, who filed a class-action suit in state court
Thursday, accused Saks stores of charging women but not men for
alterations.
   ``With this lawsuit we seek to cause Saks to mend their ways and
alter their policy. They should tailor their policies to fit
existing law, not sexually discriminatory tradition,'' she quipped.
   Martin Fischer, general manager of Saks' Beverly Hills store,
said, ``Our general policy at Saks Fifth Avenue is to charge the
customer equally based on sewing and the sewing task performed.
This applies to both men's and women's clothing.''
   The suit was filed on behalf of two executives of a career
counseling company.
   One of the women said she purchased a $1,500 evening gown at the
Costa Mesa store and was charged $40 for minor alterations, while
her husband bought a tuxedo and was not billed for extensive
alterations.
   Ms. Allred said similar policies were in effect at Saks Beverly
Hills and Saks in New York.

<TEXT>
   The Golden Lion award for the best film at
the Venice Film Festival was awarded today to ``La Leggenda del
Santo Bevitore'' (The Legend of the Holy Drinker) by Italian
director Ermanno Olmi.
   The film is based on a story Austrian novelist Joseph Roth
finished just before he died in 1939. It tells of miracles that
happen to an alcoholic bum named Andreas. Every time he needs
money, he finds it falling out of the sky.
   The best director award went to Theo Angelopoulos of Greece for
his film ``Topio Stin Omihli'' (Walk In The Fog). The film is about
two brothers, five and 11 years old, who set out on a journey to
find their father. They have been told he is in Germany but
actually no one knows who he is.
   The international jury also decided to divide the prizes for
best performances between two actors and two actresses. Don Ameche
and Joe Mantegna shared the award for best actor and Isabelle
Huppert and Shirley MacLaine both won best actress.
   Ameche and Mantegna were chosen for their performances in
``Things Change,'' a comedy directed by David Mamet.
   In the film Ameche, the veteran American actor, plays a
shoeshine man who agrees to go to jail for someone else in exchange
for money.
   Ms. Huppert won for her performance in Claude Chabrol's ``Une
Affaire de Femmes'' (An Affair of Women), where she plays a woman
condemned to die because she performed an illegal abortion that
killed another woman.
   Ms. Maclaine won for playing the title role of a maniacal,
possessive piano master in John Schlesinger's ``Madame Sousatzka.''
   The jury also decided to award the ``jury's grand prize
special'' to the film ``Camp de Thiaroye,'' by Sembene Ousmane and
Thierno Faty Sow. The jury said the film, a joint production by
Senegal, Algeria and Tunisia, deserved special mention because of
its great emotional strength and because of its masterful
cinematography.
   The film is based on a 1944 massacre of African soldiers who
fought for the Allies in World War II, and who were bombed and
killed by the French at a transit camp while they were returning
home.

<TEXT>
   Starting in 1990, Eastman Kodak Co.
employees will stop working 13 months a year.
   Kodak is abandoning the 13-month calendar developed by founder
George Eastman in 1928. The change follows a task force report that
concluded, ``It's time to harmonize the calendar.''
   The change actually makes little difference to Kodak employees,
except that department heads who make out 13 financial reports a
year now will fill out only 12.
   A Calendar Steering Committee has been formed ``to help ease the
transition and minimize the culture shock,'' according to Kodakery,
the company's internal newspaper.
   Eastman, a busy man, probably wished he could cram more than 24
hours into a day or seven days into a week. But his 13-month
calendar was intended to smooth out variations in the standard
calendar, in which months can be anywhere from 28 to 31 days long
and have four and sometimes five weekends.
   Those variations could cause Kodak's financial performance to
vary from one month to another, even though there was no real
change.
   So Kodak departments report expenses and revenues every four
weeks, with each month containing 20 work days and eight weekend
days. Thirteen of those periods make one year.
   Eastman was so convinced of the value of his calendar that he
and other business executives urged the federal government to adopt
it as the standard for all business. But the government stuck to
the traditional 12 months.
   The Eastman calendar has only 364 days in a year. Every five or
six years, the company had to add an extra week to get back in sync
with the rest of the world.

   Sen. Gordon Humphrey has apologized to a
congressional candidate for saying she should stay home with her
two children, a remark he called ``just plain stupid.''
   ``In plain English, I made a mistake, I am sorry, and I
apologize,'' the New Hampshire Republican said in a statement
Thursday.
   Humphrey unleashed protests _ both by foes and supporters of
Republican Betty Tamposi _ on Tuesday when he said it was
``self-evident that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in
Congress and have time left over for a child.''
   ``It's difficult enough being a father of a young child and a
member of Congress, as I am,'' said Humphrey, who has a 3-year-old
son.
   ``For the mother, who in our society is the primary care giver,
working 10-12 hours a day makes it impossible to give the nurturing
the child would need.''
   Tamposi has two daughters, ages 22 months and 4. A millionaire
officer in her father's real estate company, she is married and has
a nanny care for her children.
   On Thursday, Humphrey retracted his statement even though he had
insisted for two days he stood by his remarks.
   ``While everyone knows of the strains congressional families
experience as a result of the long working days of members of
Congress, I had no right to impugn the motives of any person
wishing to serve in Congress,'' he said.
   ``My statements of Tuesday, that Betty Tamposi was prepared to
place her ambitions ahead of the welfare of her children, were
unjustified and just plain stupid,'' Humphrey said.
   Tamposi and Chuck Douglas are viewed as the front-runners in the
six-person GOP primary for a U.S. House seat on Tuesday. Humphrey
supports Douglas but cannot vote for him because he lives in a
different district.
   Tamposi campaign aide Clark Dumont had called Humphrey's
statement the lowest attack ``ever experienced in New Hampshire
politics.''

   Opponents of House-passed amendments adding
the death penalty and other tough measures to an anti-drug bill say
the provisions turn the war on drugs into an attack on the
Constitution. One Congressman said today the changes are more
anti-people than anti-drug.
   The amendments would deny government benefits such as housing
loans and college grants to convicted users and allow the use of
illegally seized evidence.
   ``Some of the things that sound rough and mean and anti-drug are
anti-people,'' said Rep. Charles Rangle, D-N.Y., who offered
alternatives to both the death penalty and benefits-denial
provisions.
   Rangle, interviewed on ``CBS This Morning,'' said the measure,
if it becomes law, could penalize innocent family members of
drug-abusing veterans by kicking them out of public housing and by
denying pensions to widows.
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., appearing on the same program,
defended the amendments, saying Rangle's proposals would have left
no sanctions against college students. He called the veterans issue
``bogus'' since drug convictions could not deny them retirement,
disability or health benefits.
   Others joined Rangle in criticising the amendments.
   ``We've assaulted a great many Bill of Rights provisions,'' Rep.
John Conyers, D-Mich., and chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on criminal justice, said following Thursday's votes.
``I have yet to count how many are still standing.''
   Rep. G.V. Montgomery, D-Miss. and conservative chairman of the
Veterans Affairs Committee, complained that the benefit takeaways
would be so severe that convicted Medal of Honor winners could not
be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
   But Rep. Dan Lungren, D-Calif., sponsor of the illegal evidence
provision, responded, ``I reject the notion that someone here is
assaulting the Constitution. That's the argument you hear when
you've lost the argument, unfortunately.''
   The hardliners on drug penalties overwhelmingly won amendments
to allow a federal death penalty, deny government benefits to
convicted drug users and dealers and admit in court evidence that
was seized illegally, but in ``good faith.''
   The House added the measures to legislation that would add some
$2 billion to the $3.9 billion the government now spends to attack
illegal drugs. The bill pours money into every weapon used to
reduce demand, increase arrests and seizures, and rehabilitate
abusers.
   Debate on the comprehensive legislation is set to resume next
Wednesday, with a final vote possible on Thursday. The Senate has
not begun consideration on its version of the drug bill.
   The House still must vote on proposals that would hold back
highway money from states that refused to suspend or revoke drug
abusers' drivers' licenses; and to strip from the bill a seven-day
waiting period on handgun purchases. During the seven days, police
would have the option of conducting a background check.
   After sometimes emotional debate Thursday, the House:
   _Voted 299-111 for an amendment by Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.,
that would allow federal judges to impose the death penalty for
someone convicted of a murder during a narcotics-related felony.
   _Approved 335-67 a proposal by McCollum that would deny many
federal benefits to anyone convicted of two drug offenses,
including possession, or for a single drug distribution offense.
Benefits that could be refused include student loans, public
housing and veterans assistance.
   _Passed 259-134 Lungren's amendment for admission of evidence
seized illegally by police acting in ``good faith.''
   The death penalty amendment would give a judge the option of
imposing a 20-year-to-life sentence. A separate amendment, approved
410-1, would require a mandatory life sentence for those who kill
during a drug felony. Those measures could be in conflict, but no
immediate effort was made to reconcile them.
   The Senate voted 65-29 last June to permit the death penalty for
narcotics dealers convicted of murder in drug crimes, and for drug
``kingpins,'' defined under law as those who supervise five or more
people, commit at least three federal drug felonies and derive
substantial income from a continuing criminal enterprise.
   Most federal death penalty provisions are not enforceable
because, unlike some state laws, they were never brought into
compliance with Supreme Court guidelines on capital punishment.
Gekas said he crafted his amendment to meet the requirements.
   McCollum's amendment would deny benefits for five years to
anyone convicted of two or more drug-related offenses within a
10-year period; and for 10 years in cases of a single conviction
for drug distribution.
   Heads of federal agencies could restore benefits for those who
completed a drug rehabilitation program or were otherwise
rehabilitated.
   Veterans benefits would be denied only to those convicted of
drug distribution. Retirement, welfare, health and disability
benefits would be exempted from the penalty.
   McCollum argued that ``education and rehabilitation are not
enough'' to stop demand and added, ``If we don't have a deterrent,
we won't win the war on the demand side. And if we don't win on the
demand side we won't win the war, period.''
   Lungren asked if the House wanted to let a drug trafficker send
the message that ``I got involved in drugs in Vietnam and therefore
I'm excused.''

   Israeli security forces today arrested more
than 200 pro-PLO activists and claimed to have broken up a
clandestine network that organized subversive activities in the
Gaza Strip, the army said.
   The roundup came as Islamic militants mounted a strike that
closed most of the occupied lands in a challenge to the pro-PLO
United National Leadership of the Uprising. In some areas,
fundamentalists fought supporters of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat
with stones and fists.
   Meanwhile, police said a Palestinian who allegedly collaborated
with Israel was assassinated in Jaffa near Tel Aviv.
   In another development, hospital officials said four
Palestinians, including a 14-year-old boy, were shot and wounded in
clashes with Israeli troops near the West Bank town of Nablus.
   Elsewhere, several hundred Israeli soldiers, using a new tactic
to combat the 9-month old Palestinian uprising, sealed off the West
Bank village of Kfar Malik, 15 miles north of Jerusalem, at dawn
today and arrested about 25 Palestinians accused of anti-Israel
activities, Arab residents said.
   An army spokesman said soldiers carried lists of suspects who
allegedly carried out subversive activity and hostile acts such as
throwing rocks and bottles.
   On Tuesday, soldiers entered Qalqilya, a town of about 25,000,
and arrested about 200 Arabs. The town, located on a strategic
highway linking Israel and dozens of Jewish settlements, remained
under curfew today.
   The crackdown in Gaza broke up a regional leadership that
extended to 37 so-called popular committees, which organized
community affairs in towns, villages and city neighborhoods.
   An army spokesman said those arrested were linked with Fatah,
Arafat's faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The army claimed to have captured the Gaza leader of the PLO
network, but the spokesman declined to identify him except to say
he had been arrested previously.
   Those detained in Gaza were responsible for 40 to 50 firebomb
attacks against the shops of merchants who failed to heed strike
calls, the army spokesman said, adding the groups also planned
about 30 attacks against Israeli army patrols.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, commander of the Gaza Strip, was
quoted by Israel radio as saying he may recommend deportation for
some of those detained. Israel has deported 33 Palestinians since
the uprising began in December, despite international protests.
   Israel radio said three members of the Gaza ring were suspected
of killing Rachel Weiss, an elderly woman found near her Negev
Desert home on Aug. 3.
   The army spokesman said the arrest campaign had severely
weakened the PLO. ``We are not saying that new leaders will not
emerge, but they will not have the same influence or
organization,'' said one spokesman who demanded anonymity.
   The strike called by the fundamentalist ``Hamas,'' or zeal,
stopped workers from going to jobs in Israel and closed stores and
businesses. But in some cases fundamentalists fought PLO supporters
with stones, fists and angry words.
   Shortly before today's strike was scheduled to begin, masked
youths rode bicycles through the largely Christian town of
Bethlehem, warning shopkeepers to close within five minutes. The
merchants complied reluctantly.
   ``If the strike is going to take place then I will observe it,
not because I want to but because I am afraid that my shop will be
burned,'' said Bassam Jaber, owner of a car spare parts store.
   Arguments broke out between Hamas supporters and shopkeepers
near Bethlehem's market after Islamic militants shouting ``Allahu
Akbar'' (God is Great) started burning tires and warning merchants
to observe the strike, witnesses said. The fighting ended when
Israeli troops approached.
   Most of Arab east Jerusalem, including the walled Old City,
remained open despite the strike call.
   The strike is part of a power struggle between Islamic militants
who oppose any negotiated settlement with the Jewish state and
supporters of the PLO who have been urging peace talks.
   Hamas has a large following among the 650,000 residents of the
Gaza Strip, but their support has traditionally been weaker in the
West Bank, where 850,000 Palestinians live.
   The Islamic fundamentalist strike was called to mark the start
of the 10th month of the Palestinian uprising. Since the rebellion
began Dec. 8, 260 Palestinians and five Israelis have been killed.
   In Jaffa, police said an assailant shot and killed Ahmed
Fanjari, 55. The assailant escaped. A police commander on Israel
army radio linked the shooting to a dispute in the Moslem community
over Fanjari's selling of land.
   Palestinian sources said graffitti seen on walls in the area
accused him of collaborating with Israeli officials.

   Gunmen shot and killed a
Protestant man on a Belfast-bound commuter train today, then fled a
suburban station in a waiting car, police said.
   Hours earlier, a bomb planted in a parked van exploded outside a
village police station, injuring five policemen and nine civilians
and heavily damaging the building and nearby houses, police said.
   The shooting occurred when the train, en route from Coleraine in
the north of the province, stopped at Balmoral station in southwest
Belfast, police said. Witnesses said the gunmen boarded the train a
few stops earlier and sat opposite the victim before shooting him.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility. The man, who was
pronounced dead on arrival at a nearby hospital, was not
immediately identified. Police said he was a Protestant.
   News reports identified the slain man as a senior member in the
Ulster Clubs, a Protestant protest group that sprang up in the wake
of the Anglo-Irish agreement. The 1985 accord gave the Irish
Republic an advisory role in the British province for the first
time.
   Police said a warning was telephoned to police in the County
Tyrone village of Coagh, 25 miles west of Belfast, shortly before a
bomb exploded Thursday night outside the police station. Police
were evacuating residents from nearby houses when the bomb went
off, they said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but police said
they suspected the Irish Republican Army. The mainly Catholic IRA
recently has stepped up its campaign against authorities in the
British province.
   Two elderly men and a policeman remained hospitalized today, but
the spokesman said their injuries were minor. The others were
treated for injuries and released, he said.
   Police said the blast heavily damaged the police station and
nearby houses.
   More than 100 families were evacuated from their homes
overnight, said the police spokesman, who refused to give his name
in accordance with regulations.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Catholic Republic
of Ireland under socialist rule.

   The Vatican today said that John Paul II,
who is skirting South Africa on a five-country pilgrimage starting
Saturday, hopes to visit the racially troubled nation at a later
date.
   In an unusual statement issued on the eve of his departure, the
Vatican emphasized that the pope would welcome such a stop ``so
that he may become more closely acquainted with the vast and varied
reality of their (South African) local church.
   ``As is well known, however, the conditions prevailing in that
country are marked by complex problems affecting the coexistence of
the various ethnic groups _ problems which give rise to anxiety and
considerable concern.''
   The Vatican statement appeared directed at reports the pope had
ruled out a visit to segregated South Africa, which has a white
minority government.
   The Vatican statement said that while the pope would have liked
to visit other nations in southern Africa on this trip ``the
intense program already arranged some time ago has made it
impossible.''
   In July, the pope said that South Africa's Roman Catholic
bishops had advised against a trip at this time but that maybe he
could visit the country some day. He didn't elaborate at the time.
   Many South Africans are expected to travel to the five countries
bordering South Africa which the pope will visit _ Zimbabwe,
Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique.
   The Vatican statement pointed out that the South African bishops
whom the pope will meet in Zimbabwe had sent the pope an invitation
as long ago as 1982, and that the government had also extended its
own bid.
   Mentioning without elaborating the ``complex problems''
affecting the ethnic coexistence, the statement added: ``In such
circumstances, a visit by the pope could nevertheless favor a
positive development of the situation.''
   ``One of its many good results would be to encourage the efforts
of those _ especially the Catholics _ who are involved, with
generosity and good will, the quest for peaceful solutions for the
life of the whole of South African society.''
   South Africa dominates communications, trade, transportation and
politics in southern Africa and its influence will be felt strongly
during the 10-day trip. John Paul has been critical of South
African apartheid throughout his nearly 10-year-old pontificate.
   He has frequently visited countries whose policies local bishops
and the Vatican have criticized, ranging from Marxist Nicaragua to
authoritarian governments in Paraguay and Chile.

   Mayor Edward I. Koch urged a judge to send
parking meter thieves to jail, but she rejected his advice and
scolded him for singling out ``the little people'' in his first
court appearance in 11 years.
   Then she made him sit in the courtroom, despite what he said was
important city business awaiting him.
   Supreme Court Justice Ruth Moskowitz said she thought Koch
should stay to learn more about the defendants and see the
sentencings.
   ``He has never appeared when a commissioner was being sentenced.
He has never appeared when a borough president or someone in high
political office was being sentenced,'' Moskowitz said Thursday.
   ``These are the little people and the little people commit
crimes, too,'' she said. ``Little people are going to be treated
just the way the big boys are treated. They are human beings and
they have rights, too.''
   Koch, in his statement to the court, said he was outraged by
Moskowitz's promise to spare some of the 34 former meter collectors
a jail term or probation.
   Koch then asked to leave to conduct important city business. But
the judge refused.
   ``If you are ordering me I will stay but I don't believe you
have the right to,'' Koch said, returning to his seat in the
gallery.
   About 10 minutes later, when the first sentencing, Moskowitz
said, ``I'm going to release the mayor from custody.''
   Koch and his entourage then left the courtroom.
   Koch called Moskowitz's comments about him never appearing in
court before a ``cheap shot.''
   He said he had previously submitted written statements to judges
in the Howard Beach racial attack and the case of a former Bronx
Democratic leader convicted of corruption.
   ``I believe that if you commit a crime against government,
whether you are in a high place or a low place, you deserve to go
to jail,'' he said.
   Inside the courtroom after the mayor had left, Moskowitz said,
``I have never had a victim come into court, make a speech for the
cameras and rush out again.''

   The controversial film ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' opened in London today to poor reviews, a small protest
outside a theater and a ban on advertising in the London subway
system.
   About 150 viewers attended the first public showing of the
Martin Scorsese film about Christ's life in a 600-seat cinema on
Shaftesbury Avenue. Half a dozen protesters gathered outside.
   The film opens in two other London theaters today, but national
distribution dates have not been set.
   First into the moviehouse was Michael Fadel, who said: ``I seek
no publicity, I seek knowledge.''
   Another viewer, Glenn Petrie, said: ``I'm here to see a good
movie. I'm also making my own private protest as a Christian
against this.''
   Nearby protesters handed out leaflets and copies of the Gospel
According to St. Mark. A man chanted verses from the Bible. There
were no incidents.
   One protester, Ruth Bowhill, 23, from St. Mary Church's in
Reading, south of London, said: ``I as a Christian would never
spend money to support such a blasphemous film.''
   She said she had not seen it, but ``I know enough to know it is
abominable in God's sight, and that men are going away from God in
seeing the film.''
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie _ spiritual head of the
Church of England and leader of the 70-million worldwide Anglican
Communion _ and Cardinal Basil Hume _ leader of 5.2 million Roman
Catholics in England and Wales _ have urged Christians to shun the
film.
   London Transport Advertising, a subsidiary of London Regional
Transport, said it banned posters advertising the movie from the
subway system.
   The movie's distributors, United International Pictures, said in
a statement that the decison amounted to censorship.
   ``It is regrettable that London Transport Advertising should
take this action despite having advised me that they have not
received any letters from the public encouraging this course of
action,'' said Ken Green, the company's marketing director.
   A spokesman for London Transport Advertising, who demanded
anonymity, said: ``It doesn't matter that we have had no complaints.
   ``It is very clear this film is going to offend religious groups
because church leaders like Cardinal Hume have urged Christians not
to see it. Our job is to protect our passengers.''
   London Transport Advertising said that while the poster itself
was not offensive, it was certain to upset many passengers.
   Reaction among London critics who saw the film at a press
preview Thursday ranged from scathing criticism and charges it was
theologically offensive and artistically incompetent to lukewarm
praise.
   One part of the film shows Jesus Christ hallucinating while on
the cross about marrying and having sex with Mary Magdalene.
   The British Board of Film Classification, which decides which
movies can be shown to children and which can be seen only by
adults, on Aug. 25 granted the film a certificate allowing it to be
shown in Britain to audiences over the age of 18.

   Officials from South Africa, Cuba and
Angola failed today to resolve the key issue of when Cuban troops
will withdraw from Angola, a South African official said.
   However, the official said some progress was made during the
two-day meeting that ended today and that a cease-fire remained in
force.
   Further talks were to be scheduled, he said.
   South Africa has made independence for South-West Africa
contingent on the withdrawl of Cuban troops from Angola, where
anti-Marxist rebels are fighting the Soviet-backed government.
   South Africa has administered the territory, also known as
Namibia, for 73 years in violation of U.N. resolutions. South
Africa's military said today that two pro-independence rebels and
two members of the security forces were killed in a shootout in the
northern Namibia town of Oshikati.
   The Wednesday skirmish between guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization and the security forces was the latest
of several battles between the two sides since SWAPO said it would
begin observing a cease-fire Sept. 1.
   South African President P.W. Botha had earlier said the Angolan
peace talks, one of a series of negotiations mediated by the United
States, would first deal with reports of recent Cuban troop
reinforcements in Angola.
   He said if the reports were true, they would constitute a
violation of the month-old cease-fire agreement.
   Cuba and Angola denied the claims, saying troop ships en route
to Angola carried replacements for the 50,000 soldiers already
there.
   The Cuban troops help Angola's Marxist government battle the
guerrillas and South African forces.
   The anti-Marxist force _ Jonas Savimbi's Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or UNITA _ has been fighting the Marxist
government since Portugal granted Angola independence in 1975.
   The chief of the South African delegation, Neil Van Heerden,
said the talks allowed the two sides ``to make significant progress
on the problem.''
   ``We are going to study the proposals thatarose during the
course of the discussions'' and the parties will consult with their
governments before deciding on a date and venue for new talks, he
said.
   Van Heerden, director-general of the foreign affairs department,
declined to give details on the talks. He said, however, that South
Africa would continue with its plan to begin implementation of a
United Nations' plan for independence for South-West Africa.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, at a news briefing in
Pretoria after his country's delegation returned, said all parties
at the talks had agreed to intensify their efforts to agree on a
timetable.
   Also discussed, he said, were funding for the United Nations'
proposed independence plan for Namibia and South Africa's demand
that African National Congress guerrilla bases in Angola be removed.

   Syndicated Columnist Carl T. Rowan was in good
condition today at Georgetown University Hospital after he fainted
walking out of an auditorium where he had delivered a speech.
   Tests were being run as a precaution, but a hospital spokeswoman
said the cause of Rowan's collapse appeared to be ``heat and
exhaustion.''
   ``There's no specific reason (for the fainting episode), except
that he was suffering from heat and exhaustion,'' said the
spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified. She said the columnist
was not expected to be hospitalized long.
   Rowan, 52, was leaving a lecture hall at American University
Thursday night after giving a speech on the presidential campaign
when he collapsed, a student who was nearby said.
   The columnist, an outspoken opponent of handgun use, is
scheduled to stand trial Sept. 22 on charges that he used an
unregistered handgun and ammunition in the June 14 wounding of a
teen-ager who was using Rowan's backyard swimming pool without
permission.

   Sen. Dan Quayle was met by protesters and
by workers wearing Dukakis-Bentsen T-shirts today when he arrived
to tour a steel plant.
   Steelworker Eugene Autry, a Vietnam veteran, carried a sign
saying, ``Draft dodger Quayle, Who died in your place?'' _ a
reference to Quayle's service in the National Guard in Indiana
during the Vietnam war.
   Autry, standing at the plant as the Indiana senator's motorcade
drove past, said, ``He's asking American men to vote for him, men
whose sons died in Vietnam, whose fathers died in Korea, whose
grandfathers fought World War II.''
   Inside the stainless steel plant, machinist John Ledrich, one of
the workers wearing a shirt promoting Quayle and George Bush's
Democratic rivals, said, ``I'm here to tell you that him and Bush
are against the 60-day plan on plant closings. They've come to the
wrong place.''
   One day earlier, Joe Coyle, director of United Steel Workers
District 27, which organized the demonstration, said, ``Sen.
Quayle's record in Congress is one that is in opposition to almost
everything working people stand for.''
   Quayle's campaign was aware of the planned demonstration, but
senior adviser Ken Kachigian said, ``He's not going to run away.''
   He said Quayle has ``had a great rapport'' with steelworkers in
his home state of Indiana.
   George Niarchos, manager of production services at the plant,
said it had about 440 employees, about 100 of them trained under
the Job Partnership Training Act sponsored in the Senate by Quayle.
He said the plant has been operating for two years and had been
closed for bankruptcy before that.
   Earlier this week, Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
ran into taunts and jeers when he addressed workers at an Oregon
shipyard.
   Meanwhile, in a report that recalled stories on Quayle's
academic past that surfaced shortly after his nomination, The
Cleveland Plain Dealer reported today that Quayle was admitted to
law school under an experimental affirmative action program.
   The newspaper quoted officials at the Indiana University School
of Law who said the program was intended to increase admissions
opportunities for minorities, the economically disadvantaged and
others of differing backgrounds.
   Cleon H. Faust, the law school dean who approved the program in
1969, said, ``I can only remember blacks (as the aim of the
program).'' He added, ``The program sort of made up for their
background. The suggestion was that many (blacks) had not had the
scholastic background to cut the mustard in graduate school.''
   Quayle, on his way out of his hotel in Canton, Ohio, this
morning, told reporters, ``I got into law school fair and square,
and I did rather well there.''
   The newspaper said records of who was admitted under the program
were not released by the university.
   The visit to Massillon, and later speeches to the Canton Rotary
Club and the Copco Metal Products Co. in Youngstown follow a day in
which Quayle sought to tout the congressional foreign policy
credentials he brings to the Republican presidential ticket.
   In a speech to the City Club of Chicago, he called for a
skeptical view of the Soviet Union, saying ``the jury is still
out'' on Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's intentions.
   The Thursday speech, following his earlier attacks on Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis as weak and inexperienced in
foreign policy, was designed to show ``the breadth and knowledge
and experience he brings to the ticket on defense and foreign
policy issues,'' said press secretary David Prosperi.
   Departing from the prepared text, Quayle said the United States
must move ahead on modernization of conventional forces and
development of the Strategic Defense Initiative system.
   He also blasted the Congress, where he sits on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, for blocking foreign policy initiatives through
``micromismanagement.''
   ``Congress doesn't even know what the definition of depressed
trajectory of a ballistic missile is,'' Quayle said derisively.
``Yet they prohibit it. And they ask the secretary of defense to
please define what the depressed trajectory of a ballistic missile
is, but while you're defining it Mr. Secretary, we are going to
prohibit it.
   ``That is the kind of micromismanagement that we can do
without.''
   Quayle said he wants to see more proof of Gorbachev's commitment
to reforms in Eastern Europe, whether he will honor treaty and arms
reduction agreements and whether there will be human rights
progress.
   ``The Soviet Union, as long as it has its ideology of Marxism
and Leninism, will always be an adversary, will always be a
competitor,'' he said.

   A man mixing ice cream flavoring died after
falling into a vat of cocoa powder, authorities said.
   Jim Bill Young, 20, may have inhaled the cocoa dust in the
45-inch-deep vat and suffocated, said Polk County sheriff's
spokeswoman Lynne Breidenbach.
   Young was standing on a 7{-foot platform, dumping 25-pound bags
of cocoa into a vat Thursday at the Imperiral Flavors plant, when
he fell, Breidenbach said. ``We don't know if he lost his balance
or what,'' she said.
   Young's brother, who also works at the plant, saw him fall and
sought help.
   Rescuers removed some of the powder and pulled Young free, but
he died at the scene.

   A Soviet space official said today that a ground
control operator sent an incorrect message to a Soviet space probe
bound for Mars, and the unmanned spacecraft is now worthless.
   ``Only a miracle can save it,'' Roald Z. Sagdeyev, head of the
Soviet Space Research Institute, said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Earlier, the official Tass news agency announced that ground
control had lost communications contact with the Phobos 1 probe,
which is millions of miles from Earth and racing toward a
rendezvous with the planet Mars.
   The Phobos 1 mishap follows a foul-up earlier in the week that
delayed the landing of a Soviet space capsule carrying a Soviet and
an Afghan cosmonaut.
   The unmanned Mars probe, Phobos 1, was launched July 7, and a
twin spacecraft, Phobos 2, on July 12.
   The probes were scheduled to go into orbit around Mars and in
January drop behind Phobos, the larger of the Red Planet's two
moons, to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.
   Sagdeyev, however, said that a ground control operator at the
Soviet Mission Control Center near Moscow sent an incorrect command
to Phobos 1 during the night of Aug. 29-30 that left the spacecraft
``sleeping'' and ``frozen.''
   He said the mistake was discovered three days later and that
ground control operators were trying to correct the problem by
sending new commands to Phobos 1. But the spacecraft was not
responding, he said.
   Sagdeyev said the probe could virtually be written off as a
total loss.
   The Soviet space research chief spoke to a reporter during an
afternoon reception at the U.S. ambassador's residence in honor of
Andrei D. Sakharov, the Soviet physicist and human rights activist
who is the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   Tass, in its report, indicated that Soviet space officials had
not had any contact with Phobos 1 for at least a week.
   ``In the two months that elapsed after the blastoff, the space
probes performed 75 radio communications sessions during which
measurings of trajectory parameters were made and operation on
onboard systems and scientific equipment was monitored,'' Tass said.
   ``On Sept. 2, another planned session of radio communication
with the Phobos 1 station failed to materialize,'' Tass said. ``At
that time, the station was 17 million kilometers (10.5 million
miles) from the Earth. On Sept. 9 (today), it was 19 million
kilometers (11.8 million miles) from the Earth.''
   Phobos 1 was supposed to navigate with a NASA navigation system,
and a NASA official, Raymond J. Amorose, said Thursday the Soviets
notified the National Aeronautics and Space Administration that
they had lost contact with the craft.
   Tass indicated that scientists were in normal contact with
Phobos 2, and said today it was 11.8 million miles from Earth.
   ``According to transmitted information, onboard systems and
instrumentation of the Phobos 2 station function smoothly,'' it
said.
   Regarding the Soviet space capsule, the state-run Soviet press
said both equipment problems and errors by the Soviet flight
commander, Vladimir Lyakhov, forced a postponement of the scheduled
Tuesday landing of the Soyuz TM-5 capsule. The spacecraft, also
carrying Afghanistan's first man in space, Ahad Abdul Mohmand,
landed safely Wednesday on its third attempt.

   A Vietnamese jetliner trying to land
during a heavy storm crashed and exploded in a rice field near
Bangkok's airport today, killing 75 people and seriously injuring
six, officials said.
   The Soviet-made Tu-134 jet with 81 people aboard blew up after
hitting the field about four miles short of Don Muang International
Airport, said an air force spokesman, Sommot Sundaravej.
   The plane crashed three minutes before it was scheduled to land,
he said.
   India's ambassador to Vietnam, Arun Patwardhan, 48, was killed
along with his wife and son. Eight other Indians also died.
   A second secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Hanoi, Kiyokata
Ida, was also believed dead, said the Japanese Embassy in Bangkok.
The other Japanese passengers believed killed were two staffers of
the Tokyo headquarters of Mitsubishi Corp., Japan's largest trading
firm.
   Diplomats said two Frenchmen, two Swedes, one Briton and two
Finns also died.
   Air Vietnam Flight 831, which left Vietnam's capital of Hanoi at
10 a.m. (11 p.m. EDT), is frequently taken by foreign diplomats and
relief workers.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said no Americans were aboard the
plane.
   ``I heard an explosion louder than lightning,'' said Orn
Chuayklintes, a villager who witnessed the crash from his wooden
house nearby. ``It fell into the paddy field and a ball of fire
rolled for a kilometer (half mile).''
   Sommot said the dead included both Vietnamese and citizens of
other countries, but he did not have details.
   There was no word on what caused the crash. Both the cockpit and
flight recorders were retrieved in excellent condition, said Maj.
Gen. Sopol Savigamin, the regional police commander leading the
rescue effort.
   The cockpit recorder contains the conversation between the crew
and control tower and the other recorder contains flight data.
   The pilot lost contact with the Bangkok control tower at 11:26
a.m., and the plane soon disappeared from radar screens, said Group
Capt. Charoon Peetong, director general of the Airports Authority
of Thailand.
   The plane crashed 11 minutes later.
   Sopol said a total of 81 people, including six crew members,
were aboard. He said workers retrieved 75 bodies. Six people,
including a boy and a girl, were taken to Bhumibol Hospital with
serious injuries.
   Rescue workers pumped dry the roadside pond where the cockpit
and fuselage were lodged to retrieve bodies. Hundreds of police and
air force workers and volunteers hauled up bodies from the pond,
wrapping them in the thin beige-colored cloth customarily used for
corpses. A policeman posed for photographers holding up a severed
leg.
   The third major piece of wreckage, the tail section with the
airline's yellow star insignia, sat on the dirt road, muddied by
rains. More debris was scattered over a rice field on the other
side of the road.
   Scattered over the area were hundreds of pairs of earrings, a
shell necklace, toy plastic gun, tennis shoe, Indian passports, the
passports of two Polish students and more than 10 bags of
diplomatic mail for the Australian Embassy in Bangkok.
   The plane crashed in a sparsely populated, isolated area.
   A U.S. military team was to have taken the return flight to
Hanoi in the afternoon for talks on recently resumed efforts to
account for U.S. servicemen missing in the Vietnam War, U.S.
Embassy spokesman Ross Petzing said. There is no U.S. mission in
Hanoi.
   According to Jane's All The World's Aircraft, various versions
of the twin-engine Tu-134 jet seat 80 to 96 people. The Tu-134 is
Air Vietnam's mainstay aircraft, and Vietnamese officials have said
they would like to switch to newer planes but do not have the money.
   The last major air crash in Thailand was Aug. 31, 1987, when a
Thai Airways domestic airliner crashed into the sea off the
southern resort island of Phuket. All 83 people aboard died in the
crash of the Boeing 737. The accident was blamed on errors by the
pilot and control tower.

<TEXT>
   George Bush today charged opponent Michael
Dukakis with shifting positions on military programs and said
``it's sometimes hard to keep up'' with the Democrat's line on
defense.
   ``Does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or
doesn't he?'' Bush asked in a speech to the Illinois Federation of
Republican Women.
   Dukakis in Louisville on Thursday told a news conference he
would consider deploying the Strategic Defense Initiative _ or Star
Wars _ if research showed it would work and if it were in the
national interest.
   It was the first time the Democrat had suggested any
circumstances under which he would support deployment of the Reagan
administration's space-shield proposal, designed to destroy
incoming Soviet missiles in space.
   ``His position on SDI, calling it a fantasy one day, something
he won't rule out the next ... suggests a confusion on basic
facts,'' Bush told his audience.
   He also questioned Dukakis' claims that he would modernize
land-based weapons if essential, while re-examining the MX and
Midgetman missiles.
   ``How do you modernize the land-based leg if you oppose the MX
and Midgetman?'' Bush asked.
   ``I've tried to be fair and accurate as to my opponent's
positions, but lately they seem to have been shifting so rapidly
it's sometimes hard to keep up,'' Bush said.
   Bush's sharp criticism comes a day after he accused Dukakis of
seeking to restrain the nuclear capability of the United States
when he advocated a nuclear freeze.
   While insisting he wasn't challenging Dukakis' patriotism, Bush
slammed the Democratic presidential nominee after overseeing the
destruction of two U.S. Pershing nuclear missile engines on
Thursday.
   The engines were destroyed under a U.S.-Soviet arms-reduction
pact the vice president claimed could not have been negotiated
under a Dukakis presidency.
   In his speech today to the GOP women's group, Bush said what he
witnessed at the Army ammunition plant in east Texas the day before
``was unforgettable.''
   ``These acts of destruction were acts of peace,'' he said. But,
he added: ``yesterday would not have been possible'' had Dukakis
been in office.
   Meanwhile, Bush said he was pleased with the agreement with the
Dukakis camp to have two presidential and one vice presidential
debates.
   ``It sounds very good. Got the right number,'' Bush told
reporters upon his airport arrival here late Thursday.
   The Bush campaign had held out for only two presidential
debates, while Dukakis forces had sought three or more.
   Bush said he believed the more modest schedule finally adopted
``will have widespread support of the American voters.''
   The missiles _ actually the solid-fuel rocket first stages _
were among 859 such missiles the United States has agreed to
destroy over the next three years under the agreement to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear missiles. The Soviets agreed to destroy
1,752 under the pact and began the process last July.
   Bush, in a somber and nonpartisan address to a group of U.S.,
European and Soviet officials who witnessed the fiery destruction
of the rocket engines, called it ``a moment we will be able to tell
our children and grandchildren about.''
   ``This was the day we began to reverse the arms race, this was
the day we began destroying the weapons of destruction,'' Bush said
at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in Karnack, Tex.
   But Bush quickly shed his non-political tone at a
convention-center rally a few hours later in nearby Tyler, Texas.
   Bush cited Dukakis's past support freeze on nuclear weapons,
asserting Dukakis had taken such a stand to keep the United States
from expanding its nuclear arsenal.
   ``He wanted to restrain us, not the Soviet Union,'' Bush said.
``Therein lies a big difference between George Bush and the
governor of Massachusetts.''
   ``I don't question his patriotism,'' Bush said. ``I question his
judgement.''
   ``I want to build on the record of peace through strength. And
it can't be done if we have a naive view of the Soviet Union,''
Bush said. Reminding audience that he was met with Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Bush described the Soviet leader as ``tough.''
   ``We must not, and if I am elected I will not, make unilateral
concessions to Mr. Gorbachev or to the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Bush also praised Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., calling him ``my
young, vigorous running mate who understands defense.''
   However, Bush has not appeared with Quayle since right after the
GOP convention last month and aides said that there are currently
no plans for any joint appearances.
   After arriving in Rockford last night, Bush and his entourage
went unannounced to a local Italian restaurant, where he spent
about two hours eating and posing for snapshots. Afterwards, Bush
plunged into the crowd that had gathered outside, shaking hands and
lifting several toddlers into his arms.

   Burma's former leader said today he has
formed a rival government to take power from the forces that ousted
him 26 years ago and imposed single-party rule. About 500 soldiers
mutinied and joined the ranks of protesters demonstrating for
democracy.
   Former Prime Minister U Nu, in a letter distributed to
diplomatic missions, also announced that general elections will be
held Oct. 9 and unveiled a 26-member cabinet with himself as prime
minister, former president Mahn Win Maung as president and retired
Gen. Tin Oo as defense minister.
   There was no immediate reaction to the move, which is regarded
as high treason under current law, from the government of President
Maung Maung or the military. But one prominent opposition figure,
not included in the cabinet, called the move ``preposterous.''
   Diplomats said U Nu's chances of success are difficult to
access. Burma remains on the brink of chaos and the powerful
military is still intact. Today's also announcement was not the
first time U Nu has tried to regain control. In the 1970s, he
attempted to lead an anti-Ne Win insurgency from bases along the
Thai-Burmese border but the attacks failed.
   The mutinies from the military and U Nu's declaration came one
day after about 1 million people surged through the city of Rangoon
in the largest anti-government protest since Aug. 21.
   As a precautionary measure, embassies and other foreign
organizations evacuated more than 230 dependents and non-essential
staffers aboard a commercial Thai aircraft to Bangkok, Thailand.
According to diplomats, the evacuees included 46 Americans, 29
Thais, 28 South Koreans, 13 British citizens, two Russians and
others from Japan and Australia.
   ``Foreigners are not in danger at present but life is very
difficult,'' said one World Bank official who arrived in Bangkok.
``There's no fuel and less and less food.'' The evacuations are
scheduled to continue Saturday.
   About 400 air force personnel along with about 100 from the navy
and army marched in a student-led demonstration and called on a
large contingent of troops inside City Hall to join them. They
received no response.
   Most of the deserters were enlisted men but reporters saw
several officers of lieutenant rank. There have been numerous
reports of military defections to protesters seeking to toppled the
authoritarian system, but this was the first time a large group was
seen in the capital defying the government.
   About 200 of the mutinous soldiers joined student leaders at
Rangoon University. ``We side with democracy and not with
fascists!'' and ``Our military training is not to shoot people!''
the rebel soldiers shouted.
   ``I have taken back the power which Gen. Ne Win has robbed from
me,'' U Nu said in his letter. ``From this hour, sovereign power no
longer rests with Gen. Ne Win. It has come back into my hands, and
I announce this fact with joy.''
   The veteran, 82-year-old politician was toppled in a 1962 coup
led by Ne Win who held the reins of power for the next 26 years.
Although Ne Win officially retired as head of the ruling Burma
Socialist Program Party in July, many analysts believe he still
exercises decisive control.
   Hard-line leader Sein Lwin replaced Ne Win but resigned after 17
days and massive street protests that resulted in at least 112
deaths. Maung Maung replaced Sein Lwin, becoming Burma's first
civilian leader in 26 years, but protests have continued as
opponents try bring about a multiparty system.
   U Nu said he would stand for election but immediately turn over
power to anyone who obtained a majority of votes. Since his
government cannot provide ballots and other equipment, elections
will be held at mass town meetings and will not ``under existing
conditions'' be conducted in rural areas, the letter said.
   The absence from U Nu's government of opposition leaders Aung
Gyi and Aung San Suu Kyi indicated internal splits among government
opponents.
   ``I am glad my name is not there. It is simply preposterous,''
Aung Gyi told reporters when asked about U Nu's action. Aung Gyi is
the nation's most outspoken critic of the government. He was
arrested in July and spent a month in prison after writing a series
of letters critical of the government.
   A Western analyst in Bangkok said that despite the great show of
anti-government force, Burma's leaders appeared to be ``going ahead
with their own timetable'' of holding a special congress Monday to
pave the way for a referendum on one-party rule. He said the
powerful military also appeared to be basically intact despite
defections and ``wavering''
   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19. On Aug. 24, he announced a
planned congress of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party on
Monday to consider a popular referendum on one-party rule. But
protesters have rejected his call and demanded immediate formation
of an interim government.

<HEAD>Cavazos Vows to Continue Education Reforms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout with details from hearing.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lauro F. Cavazos promised today that as
education secretary he would continue the reforms he said were
started by outgoing Secretary William Bennett.
   ``In the last seven years we have arrested the decline in
American education, but as commendable as this effort has been, we
still have much to accomplish,'' Cavazos told a committee
considering his nomination.
   The Texas Tech University president, who if approved would
become the first Hispanic ever appointed to the Cabinet, credited
the Reagan administration with spearheading education reform by
creating the National Commission on Excellence in Education which
issued the report, ``A Nation at Risk.''
   ``Secretary (T.H.) Bell issued the warning, Secretary Bennett
took up the challenge and offered solutions, and I'm here to ensure
that educational reform proceeds and that educational excellence
once again returns to America,'' he said.
   Cavazos, the son of a foreman on the huge King Ranch of South
Texas, was praised by senators and congressmen today as a hands-on
educator, a consistent friend of education and an excellent choice
to fill the post being vacated by Bennett later this month.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee that Cavazos had ``gilt-edged credentials.''
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the nominee ``living proof the
American dream is alive and well in Texas and throughout the
nation.''
   Gramm said Cavazos would provide excellent leadership in
education, making education ``an engine for opportunity, prosperity
and growth for all Americans.''
   Committee Chairman Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said he
expects Cavazos' nomination to be voted on by the committee
sometime next week.
   Kennedy said he believes the administration has been
``profoundly hostile to the federal government's role in education.
They have relentlessly sought to slash federal education spending
and weaken the programs designed to help the most vulnerable
members of our society.''
   Before the hearing, Gramm said he didn't expect Cavazos'
nomination to be controversial.
   ``You're talking about the dean of a major medical school, the
president of a great university who has served this nation on
numerous boards and commissions around the world. He is clearly
loved by everybody that knows him. This (confirmation) is a
certainty,'' said Gramm.
   A Senate education subcommittee staff member added: ``I don't
anticipate he'll have any trouble. There's a very good chance it
will be unanimous.''
   The aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said a
strong committee vote likely would herald a quick and easy
confirmation in the full Senate, possibly next week.
   Cavazos would serve only until January when the next
administration takes over, unless the new president reappoints him
to the post.
   He was the first Hispanic to serve as president of Texas Tech.
He also serves as the president of its medical school, but is not a
medical doctor.
   A registered Democrat, Cavazos has opposed cuts in student
financial aid. He is described by colleagues as a skilled
administrator, a delegator and a consensus-builder.
   ``His leadership in education on a nationwide basis is well
known,'' Gramm said.
   Known informally as Larry, Cavazos is one of three brothers who
left the King Ranch to attend what was then Texas Technological
College.
   His brother, Bobby, was an All-American running back in football
who now has his own ranch, while the third brother, Dick, became a
four-star Army general.
   Cavazos has a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's degree
in cytology _ the study of cells _ from Texas Tech and a 1954
doctorate in physiology from Iowa State University.
   He has been Texas Tech president since 1980, and seven of his 10
children have Texas Tech degrees.

   A fire broke out early today aboard a
Norwegian ferry sailing to Oslo, and all 230 passengers were safely
evacuated in lifeboats, the national news agency said.
   No major injuries were reported. The smoky blaze started in the
dining room of the Holger Danske ferry at about 4:50 a.m., but the
cause was not known.
   The ship was off the city of Horten when the fire occurred, the
NTB agency said. The vessel was heading for Oslo from the Danish
port of Fredrikshavn.
   The 42-member crew stayed on board during the evacuation, and
the fire was put out by 6 a.m., NTB said. The ship was towed into
Horten harbor for inspection.
   Seven lifeboats, some from other ferries, were used to bring the
passengers ashore. The seas were calm at the time.
   The Holger Danske usually carries Norwegians going to
Fredrikshavn to buy tax-free liquor, tobacco, cigarettes and other
goods on board and cheap Danish meat in Fredrikshavn.
   Ragnar Hagen, managing director of DA-NO Line, said the flames
damaged the pantry and restaurant on board the 3,500-ton ferry.

<HEAD>Gibraltar Police Chief Confirms British Commandos Killed IRA Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Commissioner Joseph Canepa said today
that seven British commandos who shot to death three unarmed IRA
members in March belonged to the Special Air Services, an elite
military unit used to fight terrorism.
   Canepa also said police passed up several chances to arrest the
IRA members before they were shot. He testified on the fourth day
of an inquest on the shootings by Coroner Feliz Pizzarello and an
11-member jury.
   The Irish Republican Army has acknowledged the three _ Sean
Savage, 24, Mairead Farrell, 31, and Daniel McCann, 30 _ were IRA
members on active service when killed by soldiers in this British
colony March 6.
   Under cross-examination by Patrick McGrory, the attorney for the
families, Canepa said the seven soldiers involved in the shootings
belonged to the SAS.
   Critics of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher have accused
her government of enforcing an unofficial ``shoot-to-kill'' policy
against IRA members believed to be on attack missions against
British troops.
   The inquest, which began Tuesday and has no power of
prosecution, is to determine whether the SAS action was lawful.
   If the jury determines the killings were unlawful, the attorney
general is expected to return criminal indictments.
   Asked by McGrory why Savage was not arrested when he parked a
car near an assembly hall on the day of the shootings, Canepa said
authorities expected other members of the IRA unit to come into
Gibraltar and preferred to arrest them all at the same time.
   Canepa said the shooting took place after a police-military
advisory group concluded that the car contained a bomb.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to drive the British out of
Northern Ireland and unite the province with the Irish Republic.

   A wildcat strike this morning by 780 track
workers on rail lines to the city's northern suburbs and
Connecticut forced 95,000 commuters to scramble to get to work. A
judge later ordered the employees back to work.
   Teamsters Local 808 set up picket lines at Grand Central
Terminal and several other stations, and other unions, including
train engineers, honored the picket lines, said Metro-North
Commuter Railroad spokeswoman Susan Gilbert.
   ``We are not running trains on any of the lines,'' Ms. Gilbert
said.
   By 11 a.m., the railroad obtained a back-to-work order from U.S.
District Judge Inzer Wyatt, Gilbert said.
   ``If it's legitimate and our lawyers tell us its legal, of
course we'll comply,'' said John Mahoney, union secretary-treasurer.
   A spokesman for the National Mediation Board, which oversees
railroad labor disputes, said the strike was illegal.
   In Chicago today, an estimated 2,600 employees went on strike
against the Chicago & North Western railroad in a walkout timed to
begin as soon rush hour ended to avoid disruptions. C&NW is a
leading Midwestern freight hauler and also runs commuter trains
serving 40,000 people a day in Chicago's suburbs.
   The fate of the evening rush hour remained in the hands of
Congress, where the House today was to consider a measure imposing
a settlement.
   The New York City strike, prompted by overtime practices that
the union said endangers passengers, forced thousands of commuters
to find other ways to get to work. Metro-North, caught by surprise
by the walkout, had no contingency plan.
   ``I am advising people to either take regularly scheduled buses
or somehow get to the Bronx to take subways,'' Ms. Gilbert said.
   At Pelham, north of the city, commuters piled into taxis for a
$4 ride to a Bronx subway station. ``This is screwing everything
up, isn't it?'' said one man.
   As a cab driver pondered whether to take a fifth passenger, the
dispatcher cajoled him over the radio, ``Tell them to sit closer to
the driver. No extra charge.''
   Cars headed for Manhattan from the northern suburbs backed up
during the morning rush, and traffic on Connecticut highways into
New York was heavier than usual, police said.
   At a Bronx subway stop, a man in cufflinks who would not give
his name looked long and hard before deciding that the newsstands
did not carry the Wall Street Journal.
   The walkout was prompted by the suspension of 37 employees
Tuesday for refusing to work overtime, the union said. Union
members said the men had been handling 400-pound bridge timbers for
eight hours and wanted to go home.
   ``The quality of work is diminished by fatigue and fatigue
creates lack of safety for workers and commuters,'' said a striker,
Mike Pearson.
   The union said in a statement that it was forced to strike ``to
force the railroad to recognize its responsibility to provide a
safe railroad for its commuters and its employees.''
   Local 808 has been without a contract since January 1986.
Negotiations under way since 1985 have been stalled, Mahoney said.
Metro-North trains, serving 95,000 commuters daily, run between
Manhattan and the city's northern suburbs and Connecticut.
   ``It's an illegal strike,'' said Charles Barnes, executive
director of the National Mediation Board. ``It's a disruption of
the status quo by the union. I should think that as soon as they
can get to a judge, it will stop.''
   Commuters who tried to board Amtrak trains at Bridgeport,
Stamford or New Haven in Connecticut or in New Rochelle, the only
stops Amtrak make along Metro-North routes, were told they would
have to buy a trip to Newark, N.J., even if they wanted to get off
in New York City.
   ``We don't sell tickets, today or any day, from New Haven to
Penn Station (New York),'' said Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black.
``We are not a commuter railroad. That is the territory and
business of Metro-North.''
   Amtrak operations were not immediately affected by the strike,
but Black said Amtrak depends on Metro-North dispatchers for all
trains the run north of New York City. ``We have ordered back-up
buses in the event that we have to ferry passengers over
Metro-North territory
   The picket lines at Grand Central went up about 4 a.m., said
Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman.

<BYLINE>Non-Aligned Back Plan For Independent Palestinian State
^By MONA ZIADE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The non-aligned movement today drafted a
resolution supporting the PLO's plan to declare an independent
Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territories.
   In the Persian Gulf state of Abu Dhabi, meanwhile, PLO chairman
Yasser Arafat hinted strongly that the Palestine National Council,
the PLO's parliament-in-exile, will proclaim a Palestinian state
and form a provisional government when it meets early next month.
   The Al-Khaleej daily quoted him as saying: ``The Palestinian
leadership is about to take decisive moves which will have a
long-term impact affecting not only the Palestinian and Arab level,
but also the international level.''
   As the political momentum increased, Bassam Abu Sharif, a close
Arafat aide, said the Israeli government has escalated its efforts
to crush a 9-month-old Palestinian uprising in the West bank and
Gaza Strip.
   The Israeli army said 200 Palestine Liberation Organization
activists were rounded up in Gaza today. It claimed to have smashed
a clandestine network behind a wave of firebomb attacks.
   Speaking by telephone from Tunis, the PLO's headquarters, Abu
Sharif said Israeli troops have stormed Palestinian villages and
camps in an intensified effort to quell the uprising before the
Palestinian council convenes.
   Palestinian sources said the 450-member council will meet in
Algiers Oct.5.
   Informed sources at the non-aligned foreign ministers conference
in Nicosia said the Palestine resolution was expected to be
endorsed ``without reservation'' at a plenary session Saturday,
when the conference ends.
   The resolution also called for the 101-member non-aligned
movement to financially aid the Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories.
   The uprising, and Jordan's July 31 decision to severe legal and
administrative claims on the West Bank, have given impetus to moves
to declare an independent state and a provisional government.
   The resolution emerged from an overnight session by the
conference's nine-member Palestine committee that includes the PLO,
Cuba, Senegal, India, Yugoslavia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Algeria and
Bangladesh.
   The four-page resolution, made available to The Associated Press
in English by the source, said the movement would support any
action by the PLO ``in pursuance and exercise of the inalienable
right of the Palestinian people to independence and sovereignty in
Palestine.''
   The declaration is expected to further boost the PLO's effort to
transform the international sympathy the uprising has gathered into
political gains.
   The draft resolution also expressed concern over the situation
in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.
   Yasser Arafat's loyalists were driven out of camps in Beirut
recently after fierce fighting. They have regrouped in other camps
in south Lebanon.
   Syria, which seeks to control the Palestinian movement, and its
proxies have sought to crush Arafat's comeback in Lebanon, where he
had tried to rebuild the power base he lost in Israeli's 1982
invasion.
   The non-aligned resolution urged the United Nations to ``assume
full responsibility for the safety and the provision of safeguards
for the security of the Palestinians inside refugee camps (in
Lebanon) and in the Palestinian territory under occupation.''

<HEAD>Bush Lashes Dukakis on Star Wars; Quayle Faces Unfriendly
Steelworkers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 11 grafs with Bush, Quayle appearances,

<TEXT>
   George Bush ridiculed Michael Dukakis' views on ``Star Wars''
today, while Bush's running mate Dan Quayle switched his focus from
defense to jobs and ran into an unfriendly welcome at an Ohio steel
plant.
   ``Does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or
doesn't he?'' Bush asked in a speech in Rockford, Ill., to the
Illinois Federation of Republican women. ``I've tried to be fair
and accurate as to my opponent's positions, but lately they seem to
have been shifting so rapidly it's sometimes hard to keep up.''
   Dukakis, who was on his way to campaign in Texas today, said
Thursday in Louisville, Ky., that he would consider deploying the
Strategic Defense Initiative _ or Star Wars _ if research showed it
would work and if it were essential to the national interest.
   ``His position on SDI, calling it a fantasy one day, something
he won't rule out the next ... suggests a confusion on basic
facts,'' Bush said today.
   In Massillon, Ohio, Quayle was met by protesters and by workers
wearing Dukakis-Bentsen T-shirts today when he arrived to tour a
steel plant.
   One steelworker, Vietnam veteran Eugene Autry, carried a sign
saying, ``Draft dodger Quayle, Who died in your place?'' _ a
reference to Quayle's service in the National Guard in Indiana
during the Vietnam war.
   Quayle was politely received when he spoke to the employees of
the Mercury Stainless Corp., and the Dukakis-supporting workers
said plant management had asked them to be polite.
   The senator told the group he had worked with the Reagan
administration to reach voluntary restraint agreements that
resulted in reduction of steel imports from foreign countries.
   Also today, The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that Quayle was
admitted to law school as a young man under an experimental
affirmative action program.
   The newspaper quoted officials at the Indiana University School
of Law who said the program was intended to increase admissions
opportunities for minorities, the economically disadvantaged and
others of differing backgrounds. Quayle is white and a member of a
wealthy family.
   Quayle told reporters today, ``I got into law school fair and
square, and I did rather well there.''
   Bush had encountered a hostile blue-collar audience this week in
Portland, Ore., but Quayle campaign officials said the visit wasn't
intended to test his mettle.
   Dukakis received a friendly greeting when the Massachusetts
governor visited a General Motors Corp. engine plant in Tonawanda,
N.Y., near Buffalo.
   Dukakis hammered at Bush's comment last week that a recent rise
in the number of unemployed was ``statistically irrelevant.''
   ``On November 8, he's going to find just how relevant they
are,'' he said. Reminding the audience of the remark Bush made in
the Soviet Union that Soviet workers could give a lesson in
quality, Dukakis said, ``Those Republicans in Washington love to
blame American workers first.''
   The Dukakis campaign had prepared pink slips for today to show
that the election is 60 days off, the notice period required under
legislation opposed by the Reagan administration that would require
notification of plant closings.
   Dukakis, visiting Texas today on Bush's heels, was in Manhattan
on Thursday night with his running mate, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, for a
gala fund-raiser. The event yielded more than $5 million for the
Democratic Party, Dukakis money raiser Robert Farmer said.
   The Texas senator was visiting a farm show in Iowa before
addressing a union rally in California.
   Bush, in Rockford, Ill., was addressing the Illinois Federation
of Republican women, before other appearances in Illinois and
Pennsylvania.
   The vice president flew to Illinois after witnessing the first
destruction of a set of Pershing missile rocket engines under the
new U.S.-Soviet agreement to ban intermediate-range nuclear weapons.
   At a rally later in Tyler, Texas, Bush criticized Dukakis for
his past support of a freeze on nuclear weapons. ``He wanted to
restrain us, not the Soviet Union,'' Bush said.
   Quayle also criticized Dukakis, telling a rally in Springfield,
Ill., ``Americans are not going to turn over the peace and
prosperity to some inexperienced governor of Massachusetts.''
   Quayle earlier had given a foreign policy speech in which he
said he was skeptical about Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
policies of openness and restructuring.
   Dukakis told the 70th annual convention of the American Legion
in Louisville, Ky., that the budget deficits of the Reagan years
were hindering efforts to build up the nation's military forces.
   He also backed continued research on Star Wars, the space-based
missile defense system, and said he would support deployment if it
were proven the system would be effective and was in the national
interest.
   However, when questioned by reporters, he also said deployment
would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, and that he
wanted to keep that agreement.
   A new poll by Louis Harris & Associates for Business Week
Magazine said Bush had a 50 percent to 44 percent lead over Dukakis
among likely voters. The survey of 1,299 people was taken Sept. 1-6
and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points either way,
meaning the two candidates could be in a dead heat.
   Another poll, released in Boston by the Boston Herald and
WBZ-TV, gave Bush a lead of 45 percent to 41 percent. That suvey,
taken among 1,000 registered voters from Monday through Wednesday,
also had a 3-point margin of error.
   A tentative debate agreement was announced by Dukakis campaign
chairman Paul Brountas, who said the two candidates would meet
Sept. 25 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C. Brountas
said the second presidential debate would be Oct. 13 or 14 _
depending on the baseball playoff schedule.
   The second debate would be on the West Coast.
   Bentsen and Quayle will debate during the first week in October.

<TEXT>
   The nation's largest labor
federation staged an eight-hour strike today that interrupted
public transportation and stopped thousands of people from getting
to work.
   The 3.5-million member General Labor Confederation also
organized a huge rally in the plaza outside Government House.
   The strike _ the 12th since President Raul Alfonsin took office
in December 1983 _ was called to protest the economic policies of
the government.
   ``We want people to publicly show their desire for a change,
their repudiation of the selling off of national assets, and their
rejection of using our funds for interest payments'' on the foreign
debt, the confederation's general-secretary, Saul Ubaldini, said
Thursday.
   The strike and rally were endorsed by the opposition Peronist
and Communist political parties, and a variety of business and
labor groups.
   Supporters of Alfonsin's Radical Civic Union have said the
strike is a ploy to undermine an anti-inflation plan implemented
last month and coalesce support for Peronist presidential candidate
Carlos Menem in the elections in May.
   The economic plan _ Alfonsin's third in less than five years _
devalued the austral, cut government spending, implemented
voluntary wage and price controls and lifted restrictions on some
imports.
   The goal was to reduce inflation that amounted to a combined
53.2 percent in July and August, and to secure new loans from the
International Monetary Fund and commercial banks to help repay
interest on Argentina's $56 billion foreign debt. Alfonsin predicts
inflation this month will be below 10 percent.
   A component of Alfonsin's general economic plan is the
privatization of some of the dozens of state companies, including
the phone company, the national carrier Aerolineas Argentinas and
the national shipping line.
   Unions representing workers at the companies generally oppose
privatization, fearing that jobs will be cut.
   The opposition Peronist Party, closely tied to the unions, has
raised obstacles in Congress to the sale of state-owned companies.
   Interest on Argentina's foreign debt amounts to about $4.6
billion this year. It is a political as well as economic burden to
repay, given peoples' clamor for more public services at lower
costs.
   Early today, train signalmen went on their own 24-hour strike
that forced thousands of suburban commuters to drive to work or
stay home. City buses were to go on strike beginning at noon.
   Unions in the provinces outside the capital of Buenos Aires also
called 24-hour strikes.
   The General Labor Confederation called for an eight-hour strike
so people would come to work as usual, walk off the job at noon,
attend the rally, and be able to take public transportation home
beginning at 8 p.m.
   Union supporters plastered the walls of the capital with posters
saying, ``Don't Mess With the People.''
   Private businesses _ bakeries, offices, hardware and department
stores _ opened as usual today. They have generally ignored the
past several strikes.

   One of the radar operators on board the USS
Vincennes was so nervous in the moments before the cruiser shot
down an Iranian airliner that he tried and failed five times to
punch a button providing radar images of the plane, a Navy
investigator said today.
   The problem was one of a series of stress-caused errors which
led to the U.S. destruction of the jetliner which killed 290 people
on July 3, Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty told the House Armed
Services Committee.
   The radar operator finally got the correct image on his sixth
try, Fogarty said.
   The Navy will try to make its training more realistic, but
there's no way to simulate combat and eliminate the stress-caused
errors that led to the U.S. action, service officials told the
panel in a second day of hearings on the incident.
   ``Unless you get shot at, you're not trained in combat,''
Fogarty said Thursday.
   Fogarty headed the Navy investigation into the shooting down of
Iran Air Flight 655 by the guided missile cruiser USS Vincennes on
July 3 in the Persian Gulf. The Vincennes command thought it was
firing at an Iranian F-14 military jet when it launched two
missiles and killed all 290 persons aboard the airliner.
   Fogarty's investigation found the sophisticated Aegis tracking
equipment aboard the Vincennes worked well, but the data was
misread by crew members who were taking the four-year-old ship into
combat for the first time.
   Although the equipment functioned as it should, Navy officials
told Congress they plan to add new radio equipment to ships
assigned to the Persian Gulf area and is upgrading the ships'
tracking sensors.
   Fogarty's report was released three weeks ago and he repeated
its general conclusions to senators, who were generally supportive.
   ``I believe this was a tragic mistake,'' said Sen. James Exon,
D-Neb., echoing other legislators.
   Fogarty's investigation concluded that the Vincennes, which
carries some of the Navy's most sophisticated electronic sensors
and weaponry, was adequately trained when it sailed into the
Persian Gulf region in late May.
   ``She entered the gulf trained,'' he said, adding that ``unless
you get shot at, you're not trained in combat.''
   Capt. George N. Gee, director of the Navy's surface combat
systems division, said the service doesn't give ``specific stress
training to our people ... although that is something we're going
to look at.''
   Fogarty detailed a confused and high-stress situation in the
Vincennes' combat center. The Iranian plane was approaching as the
ship was concluding a firefight with Iranian gunboats that had
attacked the Vincennes' helicopter while the chopper was on patrol.
   ``We try not to be hysterical, we try not to be yelling,''
Fogarty said, although, ``on that day, there were a lot of items
that caused the excitement level to rise. ... There were people
raising their voices above what we would like to see.''
   The Vincennes' guns were firing as it made a high-speed turn to
bring its aft-deck guns to bear, Fogarty said.
   Amid the confusion, one unidentified officer called out a
warning to the Vincennes' skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers, that the
approaching plane might not be military.
   The officer was standing behind Rogers and called out ``possible
comm air (commercial aircraft),'' and Rogers acknowledged the
warning with ``a wave of his hand,'' Fogarty said.
   But ``other factors'' prompted Rogers to order two missiles
fired at the jet in the mistaken belief it was an Iranian military
plane.
   Those factors included the just-finished firefight, the
assumption that any plane coming from Iran was a potential military
threat, intelligence warnings about possible Iranian attacks over
the July 4 weekend and the memory of the frigate USS Stark, Fogarty
said.
   The Stark was hit by an Iraqi missile in the Persian Gulf in May
1987, killing 37 U.S. seamen. The Stark's top officers were
disciplined for not firing their weapons to protect the ship.
   In the Vincennes shooting, two errors never could be explained
satisfactorily, Fogarty said, including the mistaken belief the
Iranian Airbus was descending and the initial identification as an
F-14.
   Iran Air 655 was climbing continually from the time it took off
from Bandar Abbas and was at 13,000 feet when it was struck by the
two missiles, eight miles from the Vincennes.
   Officers in the combat center correctly identified the Airbus as
climbing until the plane came to within 15 miles of the Vincennes,
when they inexplicably concluded the plane began descending toward
the cruiser, Fogarty said. Officials have said the Aegis sensors
were functioning correctly.
   The misreading of the altitude was one of the most ``puzzling
aspects,'' Fogarty said, but the investigators were never able to
figure out how that occurred. ``The investigation was unsuccessful
in satisfactorily reconciling'' the discrepancy between electronic
data which showed the plane was still climbing and shouted verbal
statements that it was descending, he said.
   One radar operator in the combat center said the approaching
plane had sent a ``mode 2'' transmission, a transmitter used only
by military planes. Civilian aircraft use a ``mode 3''
transmission, and the Airbus transmitted information only on ``mode
3,'' the investigation noted.
   A nearby warship, the frigate Sides, had tracked the Airbus as a
possible Iranian military plane, but it concluded the plane was not
a threat, Fogarty said.

   Gymnasium bleachers collapsed at a high
school this morning during an assembly, injuring as many as 52
people, authorities said.
   Hospital officials said none of the injuries appeared to be life
threatening.
   The steel bleachers gave way at 8:11 a.m. at Maurice J.
McDonough High School, said Charles County police Lt. David
Gladwell. The students were all 11th graders, school officials said.
   Injuries ranged from bumps and bruises to broken legs and ankles
and some suspected spinal injuries, said county Fire Chief Ken
Chaplin.
   Tony DeStefano, a spokesman for the Prince George's County Fire
Department, said Charles County officials told him they had 25
people in need of emergency room treatment and 27 more who needed
medical examinations.
   ``The staff and students have been absolutely wonderful. They
reacted like clockwork,'' said Linda Dent-Brown, administrative
assistant to the superintendent at the county Board of Education.
``There was no hysteria. They're comforting each other and helping
each other.''
   Mary S. Haag, spokeswoman for Physicians Memorial Hospital in La
Plata, said 29 people arrived there, all in stable condition.
   Four students were taken by helicopter to Prince George's
Hospital Center and admitted in good condition, hospital
spokeswoman Carol Cox said. Some complained of back pain and could
have broken bones, she said.
   ``They're all in very good condition,'' she said. ``They're all
awake and alert and talking.''
   Twelve others with minor injuries were taken to a hospital in
Clinton, Mrs. Haag said.
   Pomfret is about 80 miles south of Baltimore. Classes began
Sept. 1.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chance of rain and snow
raised firefighters' hopes in matchstick-dry Yellowstone National
Park, but high wind today threatened to spread fires that have
charred 1.2 million acres and all but closed the tourist spot.
   ``A lot of acreage could burn'' over the weekend, David
Freeland, a commander on a 221,800-acre fire, said Thursday as
firefighters extinguished flareups near Old Faithful geyser in
America's oldest national park.
   Residents of Cooke City and Silver Gate, Mont., just northeast
of the park, who were among 150 townspeople evacuated Tuesday, were
told to leave again Thursday night for fear of flareups in another,
119,000-acre fire at the park.
   ``They knew when they came back in that this could happen,''
fire information officer Craig Flentie said in Cooke City. Fire
closed the main road into town.
   ``We're back into another critical situation,'' information
officer Bob McHugh said today, noting that the forecast called for
30 to 40 mph wind today and 50 to 60 mph wind on Saturday.
   All but a small section of the 2.2 million-acre park was closed
to visitors to ensure an open path for fire trucks and to protect
tourists from flames that have blackened 1.2 million acres in and
around Yellowstone.
   Elsewhere, near the Utah town of Whiterocks, a 12,000-acre
brushfire destroyed five homes and cabins and forced the evacuation
of more than 20 families, officials said. The fire today burned to
within a mile of town.
   Fires also burned in Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho and
Washington. Wildfires have blackened 3.65 million acres, an area
larger than Connecticut, in what federal officials have called the
worst fire season in 30 years.
   President Reagan directed Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng,
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel and Deputy Defense Secretary
William H. Taft IV to visit the Western states this weekend and
assess the situation, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Congress passed a bill Thursday clearing the way for Canada to
help battle wildfires with firefighters, aircraft and other
equipment. Reagan was expected to sign the bill allowing the U.S.
Forest Service to reimburse Canada for its help today, according to
the office of Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo.
   Canada has 35 planes ready and available, said House Agriculture
Committee staffers.
   The weekend forecast for Yellowstone called for winds increasing
to 40 mph by Sunday, with gusts up to 50 mph.
   Freeland said the result could be worse than Aug. 20, when winds
whipped blazes over thousands of acres in the worst day of the year
for firefighters.
   But the weather was expected to be much cooler, with
temperatures possibly below freezing by Saturday, said Denny
Bungarz, a fire commander. There was a chance of rain, with snow at
higher altitudes by Monday, Bungarz said.
   ``It will obviously slow things down,'' he said. ``If it
continues to bring moisture, we'll be in pretty good shape. If
there's a few inches of snow and then several more weeks of warm
weather, we'd be in trouble again.''
   ``Man will not put these fires out himself,'' Idaho Gov. Cecil
Andrus said in an interview on ABC's ``Nightline.'' ``We need help
from above.''
   Bungarz said that even if the weather worsens fire conditions,
the Old Faithful complex and the town of West Yellowstone, Mont.,
at the park's west entrance should have little to fear.
   ``We may see some flareups here and there from the strong winds,
but we won't see anything like we did'' when the fires hit Old
Faithful Wednesday.
   ``It looks as if the burn that went through pretty much
fire-proofed the Old Faithful area'' by removing fuel that could
feed the fire if it approaches the area again, Bungarz said. He
said the same conditions were seen at West Yellowstone.
   The south, east and northeast entrances to Yellowstone were
closed, although calmer weather allowed reopening of the park's
west entrance.
   The only tourist attraction open was Mammoth Hot Springs, which,
like Old Faithful, includes a hotel and campground, a restaurant,
visitor center, employee dormitories and a small grocery store.
   The complex was surrounded on three sides by smoke and flames,
and by early afternoon helicopters were dropping water on the
flames while firefighters took the precaution of applying foam to
some of the buildings.
   Meanwhile, in nearby Bridger-Teton National Forest, a search for
a firefighter who disappeared from fire lines on an 86,345-acre
fire was suspended when 36-year-old Peter Alire returned to his
fire camp.
   Firefighters in Glacier National Park on the Montana-Canada
border struggled to flank a 27,500-acre forest fire that has burned
more than a dozen homes.

   An 18-year-old transient has pleaded
innocent in the death of a motorcyclist whose throat was slashed by
a cable stretched across a bridge.
   Jason D. Levison entered his plea on Wednesday in Municipal
Court.
   Police said a girl told them she saw Levison stretch a cable
from a light standard on the bridge and loop it through a chainlink
fence on the opposite side, leaving it hanging approximately four
feet off the pavement.
   Bill Reynolds was killed Saturday when he rode across the bridge.
   ``It was a spur-of-the moment thing,'' said Sergeant Brad Marsh.
``He said he was bored and was tired of watching the traffic.''

<HEAD>Aspin Says Vincennes Skipper `Made Right Decision'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy captain who ordered the destruction
of an unidentified plane that turned out to be an Iranian
commercial jetliner ``made the right decision, based on what he
knew at the time,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Friday.
   ``I believe he did the right thing, given what he knew,'' said
Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, after
hearing Navy investigators detail the series of stress-caused human
errors which led to the July 3 incident.
   All 290 people aboard Iran Air Flight 655 were killed when the
plane was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz by two missiles fired
by the USS Vincennes. The cruiser thought it was shooting at an
Iranian F-14 possibly headed for an attack on the ship.
   Aspin's conclusion echoed statements made by other legislators
during two days of hearings on the investigation led by Rear Adm.
William M. Fogarty.
   Fogarty's report was made public three weeks ago, and he
provided few new details in his testimony to congressional
committees.
   But the decision by the Vincennes' skipper, Capt. Will C.
Rogers, to fire two Standard missiles at the approaching Iranian
warplane was not criticized.
   That reaction was in sharp contrast to criticism of officers
aboard the USS Stark, a Navy frigate hit by an Iraqi missile in May
1987, killing 37 American naval personne.
   ``In the one case, the Stark, you criticize the officers for not
protecting their ship, for not protecting their men. I don't see
how you can turn around and then criticize the Vincennes' captain
for acting to protect his ship,'' Aspin said. ``I think you have to
give the captain latitude.''
   Fogarty's investigation found that the sophisticated Aegis
tracking equipment aboard the Vincennes worked well, but concluded
that the data was misread by crew members who were taking the
four-year-old ship into combat for the first time.
   ``I think a kind of `group-think' takes over in this kind of
situation and leads to this kind of happening,'' Aspin said.
   As one example, he said the Aegis equipment showed the Iranian
A-300 Airbus was climbing from the time it left Bandar Abbas, but
that observers in the Vincennes' combat center misinterpreted the
data and believed the plane was descending directly toward the
cruiser.
   ``You had one person make a mistake and then he's talking about
in the combat center and no one's going to walk over to his console
and read and tell everyone he's wrong,'' Aspin said.
   The Fogarty report detailed a number of human mistakes. In one
instance, it said, an operator failed on five attempts to get the
computers to select a weapon to shoot at the plane. The sixth
succeeded.
   Fogarty and other Navy officials said the service plans to try
to improve training so that it will be as realistic as possible,
but they admitted there is a psychological and emotional component
to combat which cannot be simulated.
   Aspin agreed. He said the committee will hold hearings later
this year to consider ``this entire question of stress and
combat,'' with testimony from psychologists.

   The Coast Guard today reopened a 50-mile
stretch of the Mississippi River to limited traffic while workers
mopped up the last of a flammable, poisonous chemical spilled when
a barge ran aground.
   The barge, which split open before dawn Thursday upstream near
Natchez, Miss., was loaded with styrene, a clear chemical that
floats on water, said Chief Warrant Officer Rick Meidt of the Coast
Guard Marine Safety Office.
   More than 40,000 gallons, or 1,000 barrels, spilled into the
river, said Louis Stahlberg, Coast Guard officer of the day.
   The Coast Guard closed the river between Natchez and Angola, La.
   The barge was one of 13 being pushed by a tugboat owned by Apex
Towing Co. of St. Louis, Mo.
   Four members of the tug's crew were treated at a hospital for
dizziness and nausea, Meidt said.
   Authorities said styrene vapors can irritate the eyes and throat
and can cause loss of consciousness. Direct contact with styrene
can burn the skin.
   The cause of the accident had not been determined, Meidt said.

   Presidential politics overtook the House when
Democrats killed a Republican proposal Friday to begin each day
with the Pledge of Allegiance, then came back with a plan to recite
the pledge twice next week.
   Rep. John Rowland, R-Conn., using one of GOP nominee George
Bush's frequent campaign themes, started it all with a resolution
calling on the speaker or his designee to lead House members in a
daily recitation of the pledge.
   Rowland noted that the pledge is routinely recited in
classrooms, at athletic events and elsewhere, and declared: ``It's
about time that we set a good public example of our love and our
patriotism for our great nation by reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance each morning in this chamber.''
   Bush has repeatedly attacked his Democratic rival, Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis, for vetoing a bill that would have penalized
teachers who didn't lead their classes in the pledge. Dukakis said
had been advised by the state Supreme Court that the bill was
unconstitutional.
   Rep. Ken Gray, D-Ill., presiding over the House at the time,
said the Rowland's resolution would change House rules and
therefore was not in order. Rowland appealed the ruling, but the
House agreed 226-168 to let it stand.
   Seven Democrats joined every Republican present in voting with
Rowland.
   Lest the Democrats be perceived as anti-pledge, House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, then made an unusual appearance on the floor
to defend Gray's parliamentary ruling and accuse the GOP of trying
to play politics with the pledge.
   ``All of us embrace the Pledge of Allegiance, but it is
important that all of us recognize that the pledge of allegiance to
the flag is something intended to unite us, not intended to divide
us,'' Wright said. He got a standing ovation from cheering
colleagues.
   Wright said he would ask Reps. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss.,
chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, and Jerry Lewis,
R-Calif., to lead the pledge on Tuesday and Wednesday next week.
   ``Let us seriously reaffirm that the rules of the House are
important and that the rules of the House are not subject to
temporary emotions and sudden whims,'' Wright said, ``and that all
of us embrace the flag and the Constitution of the United States,
one nation, under God, indivisible ...''
   Lewis was not satisfied. He said he was unsure of Wright's
intentions beyond Wednesday and would keep trying to bring
Rowland's resolution to the floor. What is needed is ``a full-scale
debate on the Pledge of Allegiance,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A man whose two mixed-breed pit
bulls attacked and critically injured his mother is asking the
county to return the animals to him instead of destroying them.
   Terrence Young's dogs, who had bitten other people, were
impounded after they attacked his 76-year-old mother, Anna Young,
on July 5. They are being held at the Broward County Animal Control
shelter.
   Outside Thursday's hearing, Young, of Pompano Beach, said that
people who committed similar crimes were imprisoned, not killed. He
called his pets, named Honey and Bruiser, ``defenseless little
dogs.''
   Al Davis, director of Animal Control and the hearing officer in
the case, said he would decide the matter in 10 days.
   Several witnesses, including a mailman bitten by the dogs,
argued against the dogs' release.
   Deborah Stuck, the paramedic who treated Mrs. Young, described
how the left side of Mrs. Young's neck had been mauled, her breasts
ripped and her legs shredded.
   Richard Collard, executive director of the Humane Society of
Broward County, said the dogs should be put to death or they would
attack again.
   The Youngs' lawyer, Martin Jaffe, contends the county has not
determined that the dogs are vicious. Jaffe said that under county
ordinances, a dog can be impounded only if it attacks someone after
it has been determined to be vicious.
   Mrs. Young was in critical condition Friday at the Northwest
Regional Medical Center. She was taken of life support at the
hosptial shortly after the July 5 accident, but while being
transferred to another hospital her ambulance was struck by a car.
   After the accident, she was again admitted to Northwest in
critical condition.

   Patients with flood-related diseases
clog the hospitals of Dhaka, and millions of gallons of raw sewage
is being poured into stagnant waters where children swim and people
wade.
   Water levels in major rivers continued falling Friday but
remained far above flood stage, thwarting relief efforts. The
floods have covered three-quarters of Bangladesh, and up to
one-fourth of its 110 million people are homeless.
   Helicopters can land only in dry areas, and even short distances
are difficult by boat. As a foreign diplomat put it in one case:
``It's only 30 miles by crow, but you can't get there by crow.''
   Dhaka newspapers reported 101 more deaths in 24 hours and put
the total at 1,402. The government count remained at 609 and is
considered far too low.
   The government health center said 135,537 diarrhea cases have
been reported nationwide, including at least 8,254 among Dhaka's 6
million people.
   Official statistics put the death toll from diarrhea at 93
across the country, but reports of illness and death come only from
areas that can communicate with the capital.
   Health officials estimated 40 million gallons of raw sewage a
day was being dumped into stagnating flood waters where children
swim for fun and adults wade to food markets and relief centers.
   Doctors at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease
Control said the number of patients admitted has more than doubled
since Dhaka was flooded two weeks ago.
   They said 376 patients, most of them babies and small children,
were admitted to the hospital in the previous 24 hours compared
with an average 155 a day during all of August. Floods began in
June with the monsoon season, abated, then became devastating late
last month.
   Cots with green plastic sheets filled the wards and halls of the
center, which is financed by foreign donors.
   Rajia Begum sat cross-legged on a cot tending her 9-day-old son,
not yet named. The whites of her eyes were yellow with jaundice,
which Dr. M.D. Abdus Salam said probably was caused by hepatitis.
   She brought her wan infant to the hospital three days ago, after
neighbors with a boat rescued them from her flooded home.
   Abdus Salam, chief physician at the hospital, said the baby's
chances of survival were good because he received medical attention
in time.
   The diarrhea center pioneered the manufacture of a simple saline
rehydration solution in Bangladesh, and in normal times supplies it
to other hospitals. Abdus Salam said Friday, however, that the lab
now works around the clock just to supply the center's own needs.
   At least two large cargo planes brought in relief supplies
Friday, but the problem still was how to get the material to people
marooned in spots where even helicopters cannot land. Normal
operations resumed Thursday at the Dhaka airport, which was closed
to all but small aircraft for six days.
   Among the places in desperate need was the Rupganj area 20 miles
south of Dhaka. The English-language Bangladesh Observer said
50,000 people were stranded there, ``fighting a grim battle for
their survival as no relief material has reached them yet.''
   Such relatively short distances are difficult to cover by boat
because a craft large enough to carry a useful amount of relief
goods must follow rivers with water deep enough to support it.
   The diplomat who said ``you can't get there by crow'' was
recounting the plight of a flooded hospital whose nurses and
doctors put their patients in boats. ``A speed boat would take 2{
hours'' to reach the hospital, he said, ``but a relief launch will
take all day.''

   Advocates for the hungry didn't see the
humor in a stunt in which a 12-ton steamroller crushed 1,460
oranges Friday as a symbol of what fans hope will happen at the
Ohio State football opener.
   Radio station WBNS-AM sponsored the event because the Ohio State
University Buckeyes play the Syracuse University Orangemen here
Saturday. The station is at 1460 on the radio dial.
   There were no protesters among the 20 people watching the stunt,
but the station received a couple of calls from critics, and people
who provide food for the hungry expressed concern.
   ``Any waste of food to us is wasting a valuable resource,'' Matt
Habash of the Mid-Ohio Food Bank, said.
   Sue Stanton, WBNS promotions director, said pulp and rind
salvaged from the crushing would be donated to feed animals at the
Columbus Zoo. The oranges were either green or old and not fit for
people to eat, she said.
   ``We're really not wasting any food,'' she said. ``We don't
encourage wasting of food by anyone.''
   Ms. Stanton said the event was in the spirit of football, and
``we're very sorry anybody takes it in any other light or manner.''
   Another radio station, WSNY, held a contest Friday in which nine
people tried to impress judges with the most unusual way to crush
an orange.

   Tropical Storm Florence grew into a hurricane today
and headed for the Gulf Coast between Louisiana and the Florida
Panhandle with wind of 80 mph, the National Hurricane Center said.
   The storm was expected to hit land this evening with wind up to
100 mph. Gusts of 50 mph buffeted the Louisiana coast by early
afternoon.
   Up to 10 inches of rain were forecast in southern Lousiana,
Mississippi and Alabama and the Florida Panhandle, and hurricane
warnings were posted from Cameron, La., to Pensacola.
   Maximum sustained winds near the storm's center were 80 mph at 2
p.m. EDT, well over the 74 mph threshhold at which a tropical storm
becomes a hurricane, said Bob Sheets, director of the hurricane
center.
   Florence is the sixth storm and the second hurricane of the 1988
Atlantic hurricane season.
   At 2 p.m., Florence was near latitude 27.5 north, longitude 89.2
west, or about 180 miles south of New Orleans. It was moving north
at near 15 mph.
   If the storm maintains its course, it will probably reach land
in the Mississippi River Delta area, southeast of New Orleans,
according to the storm center. But forecasters warned that the
course was unpredictable.
   Mayor Andy Valens of Grand Isle, La., a town of 2,000 on a
barrier island, ordered residents to evacuate. Grand Isle State
Park, a camping area, was closed. ``If they don't move out, they
will be arrested,'' said Valens.
   New Orleans, which is almost surrounded by the Mississippi River
and Lakes Pontchartrain and Borgne, prepared for an onslaught of
wind and rain.
   ``We've got full crews out closing flood gates along the
industrial canal and the lakefront,'' said Levee Board spokesman
Jean LaPlace.
   Thousands of oil workers on offshore rigs were ordered ashore.
``Everything off the coast of Louisiana has been or will be
evacuated,'' said Chevron spokeswoman Julia Freeman.
   Tropical storm warnings of winds to 50 mph were posted from east
of Pensacola to Apalachicola, Fla., and a hurricane watch _ which
is less serious than a warning and advises residents that a
hurricane is possible _ was in effect from Cameron west to Port
Arthur, Texas.
   Near where the storm hits, tides could be up to 9 feet above
normal, the weather service said. Tides from Pensacola westward to
Morgan City, La., were expected to be 3 to 5 feet above normal
today.

   A tall, silver-haired man who
drives a new Lincoln Town Car and flashes a wallet full of cash has
been wooing lonely older women around Florida, then making off with
their money, cars and jewels.
   ``This guy is slick,'' said Palm Beach County Sheriff's
Detective Dave Hoyt. ``He could charm the socks off a dead guy.''
   Police say Artie Frankford, alias James Ferguson, is a
smooth-talking former condominium maintenance man in his middle 60s
to early 70s. Arrest warrants against him date back over a decade.
   The latest victim, a 61-year-old widow from suburban North Palm
Beach, told police she let him move in for a month, and came home
one day to find $4,000 worth of jewelry missing.
   ``He was unbelievably smooth,'' she said Thursday. ``It was
wining, dining, dancing and trips. He mixed with the family, and he
was a very giving guy who always paid for things. You would never
have known.''
   Frankford told the woman he was a federal government retiree who
just returned from 28 years in Alaska, which explained his lack of
friends.
   ``My kids said he was too good to be true, and he was,'' said
the woman, who asked not to be indentified.
   Frankford disappeared a day before they were to start a
three-week vacation in Tennessee and the Carolinas, she said.
   ``This woman's husband died four years ago, and she's a really
nice lady,'' Hoyt said. ``He met her at a church singles dance
where he came across as a worldly guy who's been around.''
   Hoyt believes other women may be too embarrassed to come
forward. Manya Joyce of North Palm Beach, director of the U.S.
Senior Athletic Games in the county, shares that belief.
   ``Late last fall I got a call from him, and he said he wanted to
volunteer to help the games,'' Joyce said. ``So I introduced him to
the people I was working with. And one day he said he had to go
back to Tampa.''
   But then from April through July, she got calls from three
distraught women trying to find him because of property he had
taken, they said. He had told them he was vice president of the
Senior Athletic Games, Joyce said.
   ``They were pretty upset, so I told them to go to law
enforcement,'' she said. ``These people take him in. That's the sad
part.''
   Police agencies across the state on the Gulf Coast also are
seeking Frankford. The earliest arrest warrant dates to February
1979. A Sarasota socialite told police that Frankford, then known
as James Ferguson, met her at a church function, moved in and then
stole her Mercedes-Benz.
   Sarasota Detective Stanton Hayes said a man matching Ferguson's
description later moved to Lakeland and married a prominent woman.
   ``Then he left with about everything she had,'' Hayes said.
   Largo detective Jack Pressmar said an arrest warrant was issued
for Ferguson about 10 years ago when he was a condominium
maintenance man.
   ``He house-sat for a couple, and when they came back, their
silver and crystal sets were gone,'' the detective said. ``The
people were just flabbergasted. He's got his trade down pat.''
   ``This guy is always about two steps ahead of us,'' Hayes said.
``He's very low-profile, he keeps disappearing, and he does all the
right things. Why shouldn't they trust him?''

   Richard Stasiowski is free of a two-year
nightmare that began when a box of checks was stolen from him.
   After 10 trips to court, 19 days in jail, loss of his
$30,000-a-year job and his girlfriend, he was exonerated Thursday.
   In September 1986, a thief wrote thousands of dollars in bad
checks at supermarkets and convenience stores. Stasiowski's lawyer
believes a box of 250 checks was stolen almost immediately after
they arrived at the victim's address.
   Stasiowski, a 29-year-old apartment maintenance supervisor,
decided to open a new bank account at Benjamin Franklin Savings
when he changed jobs and addresses. He made a $1,100 deposit and
ordered checks printed with his name, new address and driver's
license number.
   ``All of a sudden I was receiving 10 or 15 insufficient-funds
notices a day in my mailbox,'' Stasiowski said.
   Bank officials didn't believe his story. When a policeman
stopped him for a traffic violation in January and learned arrest
warrants had been issued, Stasiowski was put in jail for 19 days.
   During that time, his apartment was burglarized and $1,000 worth
of electronics gear was stolen. He was fired from his job. His
girlfriend, who works for a bank, decided to end their relationship.
   Finally, on Thursday, visiting state District Judge E.W.
Patterson dismissed theft-by-check charges at the urging of
prosecutor Joan Huffman.
   ``According to the handwriting experts, he didn't write the
checks,'' Ms. Huffman said.
   Ms. Huffman said Stasiowski's problems might have ended sooner
had he gone to his bank and executed a forgery affidavit, swearing
he had never received the checks mailed to him.

   Imprisoned and exiled for 18 years,
former Prime Minister U Nu once appeared to have accepted his
position as Burma's ``forgotten man.''
   That is, until Friday, when the 82-year-old politician sallied
forth in an attempt to lead anti-government forces to restore the
democracy he was forced to surrender 26 years ago.
   U Nu, who spent the last few years translating Buddhist
scriptures, said Friday he has formed a government to challenge the
authoritarian system imposed by military leader Ne Win in 1962.
   But his chances of success are not known. Burma is on the brink
of chaos and the powerful military is still intact. In addition,
the opposition appears fragmented.
   In his favor, diplomats said U Nu is probably the least
controversial of the opppositon leaders. But they added much will
depend on his advisers.
   Born in the Irrawaddy Delta town of Wakema, U Nu joined the
nationalist drive against British colonialism at Rangoon
University, where he was elected president of the influential
student union.
   With the assassination of his close friend, independence fighter
Aung San, U Nu took over the leadership of a free Burma.
   U Nu served as prime minister for most of the period between
1948 and 1958 when Ne Win took charge of a caretaker government. U
Nu was re-elected prime minister in 1960 but toppled two years
later by the ambitious general, who imprisoned him for the next
four years.
   U Nu's record was mixed. He was unable to curb muscle-flexing
generals and squabbling politicians. Crime soared and some of
Burma's many ethnic minorities began their now four-decade-long war
against the central government.
   But the economy improved and U Nu maintained the trust of other
ethnic groups. Both the press and the political arena were alive
with debate.
   One of the original members of the Third World's non-aligned
movement, U Nu laid the foundations of Burmese neutralism. But
unlike Ne Win, he maintained open relations with the world's
superpowers.
   In 1955, U Nu proudly told stunned Soviet leaders that he had
broken the back of the domestic communist movement. The same year,
he lectured Washington about opening diplomatic relations with
communist China.
   In 1969, U Nu left Burma and spent the next 11 years as an exile
in Thailand and India. From bases along the Thai-Burmese border, he
attempted to lead an anti-Ne Win insurgency. He even sent a small
aircaft over Rangoon to drop leaflets calling for an uprising.
   But U Nu proved a poor insurgent, and in 1974 Thailand asked him
to leave the country. Indira Gandhi, then prime minster of India,
gave him with a yellow stucco house on a hillside in the city of
Bhopal, where he lived a quiet life. Newspaper articles called him
``Burma's forgotten man.''
   He returned to Burma in 1980 under a general amnesty offered by
his archrival, Ne Win, promising to stay out of politics and devote
the rest of his life to translating Buddhist works into Burmese.
   A writer of plays, poems, novels and political works, U Nu also
has been a keen translator. Among his renderings into Burmese have
been the works of Karl Marx and Dale Carnegie's ``How to Win
Friends and Influence People.''

   With a coonskin hat, country music star
Johnny Cash will play frontiersman Davy Crockett in a new multipart
adventure tale for NBC's ``The Magical World of Disney.''
   Cash plays Crockett at the age of 50 in the opening two-hour
episode. He will recall his earlier exploits, with Tim Dunigan
playing the younger Crockett.
   Dunigan was selected from among 1,000 actors for the role
created by Fess Parker in ABC's ``Disneyland'' in 1954-55.
   The highly popular Davy Crockett series on ``Disneyland'' was
television's first miniseries. Coonskin hats and Davy Crockett
T-shirts were a rage with children, as was the song refrain
``Daaaavvvy, Daaaavvvy Crockett, king of the wild frontier!''
   The role of the older Crockett was offered to Parker, who now
owns a hotel in Santa Barbara, but he declined. The new Crockett
series will probably debut in November.

   Hundreds of radical students shouting
slogans against the government and Olympic games hurled firebombs
and rocks at riot police Friday.
   The battle began at Yonsei University in western Seoul when
police stopped about 600 students from marching off the campus to
protest the arrest Thursday of the head of the student association.
He was charged with leading an anti-Olympic campaign.
   Students attacked about 1,000 riot officers, who responded by
firing tear gas grenades and flinging rocks back at the protesters.
   Thousands of students remained indifferent inside the campus
during the melee along the fences, which lasted about half an hour.
At least five students were seen bleeding, hit in the face by
stones. No arrests were reported.
   ``Oppose dictatorial Olympics suppressing democratic forces!''
protesters shouted.
   Radicals claim the government is using the Olympics, scheduled
for Sept. 17-Oct. 2 in Seoul, to perpetuate division of the Korean
Peninsula and what they describe as dictatorship.
   They say the games heighten the risk of war with communist North
Korea, which decided to boycott them after its demand to be co-host
was rejected.
   The radical students are a small, powerful minority on campus
but lack public support.
   Authorities ordered a crackdown Friday leaflets denouncing the
Olympics and demanding they be shared with North Korea.
   Police said security guards arrested a student volunteer at the
main Olympic stadium Thursday who was caught trying to bring in
about 100 of the leaflets.
   Special squads stand ready to cover campuses in Seoul and
security forces are posted throughout Olympic venues in case of
terrorism.
   President Kim Il Sung of North Korea said in a speech marking
his nation's 40th anniversary Friday he would welcome a visit by a
South Korean delegation to discuss national reunification.
   Many officials in Seoul believe his proposal responded to an
offer Aug. 15 by President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea to improve
relations with the North. Roh said he is willing to meet Kim ``at
any time, any place, without any condition'' to discuss all pending
issues.
   South Korean reaction to Kim's remarks was cautious. ``We need
time to scrutinize the proposal,'' one senior government official
said privately.
   A summit would be the first between the heads of the two Korean
states since partition at the end of World War II.
   If a South Korean delegation visits Pyongyang, Kim said, its
sole purpose should be to discuss his long-standing ``confederate
system'' of unification.
   That calls for the two Koreas to retain their own political
structures while operating as one nation internationally. South
Korea calls it an attempt to unify the peninsula under a communist
government.

   President Reagan made a telephone call to a
drug enforcement agent seriously wounded in the line of duty Friday
and said the call makes him want to take on congressmen opposed to
the death penalty in drug cases.
   Reagan described his telephone call to Bruce Travis, a special
agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration who was shot during
a drug arrest in New York City Tuesday night, as he ended a speech
to the Federalist Society, a lawyers' organization.
   Reagan told the audience he had just received word of the
shooting. He said the agent ``was sitting in a car; he was actually
providing protection to a home where the people in the home had
been threatened, their lives threatened, because of their work
against drugs.''
   ``Just before coming over, I made a telephone call to the
hospital,'' he said.
   The president said Travis was shot in the head and the bullet
``came out from the forehead, very close to the eye.''
   ``The voice on the phone turned out to be his father's, because
he cannot speak,'' the president said. ``It will probably be a year
of continuous surgery before he is able to come back among us.''
   Reagan said the agent's father, identified by the White House as
Buddy Travis, ``told me his son couldn't speak, but could hear. So
he said, `I'll hold the phone to his ear and when you hear the
tapping, that means he is on and listening.'
   ``So I was able to tell him of our pride in him, how much we
appreciated his sacrifice and how much he would be in our prayers.''
   Then, the president said, he said goodby and the wounded agent
tapped on the telephone to show he had heard.
   ``Well, in this morning's paper, I had read some of the
statements by the opposition in Congress to the death penalty
amendment that was passed yesterday (expressing) sheer horror at
the idea that we should be taking someone's life away in connection
with drugs,'' Reagan said.
   ``I have been thinking about that ever since this telephone
call,'' he said. ``I would like to engage some of them in personal
conversation. ``In fact, I'll go out of my way to do it.''
   The House approved by a vote of 299-111 on Thursday an
administration-backed amendment to an omnibus drug bill that calls
for a federal death penalty for persons who kill in the course of a
drug-related felony. Opponents in the Senate have said they may
stage a filibuster if a similar amendment is proposed there.
   During the House debate, Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the House select committee on narcotics, opposed the
amendment, saying, ``The bums who are out there every day dealing
in drugs, they have no fear of death.''
   Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., also opposing the death penalty,
asked, ``How can you kill people who kill people to teach people
who kill people that killing people is wrong?''
   Reagan, in his speech, said his administration hired more than
4,000 new drug enforcement agents and prosecutors with Vice
President George Bush overseeing a program to coordinate federal,
state and local efforts to combat drug trafficking.
   ``But we're not satisfied,'' he said. ``We're proposing to step
up the pressure.''

   A multimillion-dollar space probe designed to
unlock the secrets of Mars fell into a ``deep lethargic sleep'' and
is worthless because of a ground controller's error, a scientist
said Friday.
   It was the second Soviet space mishap revealed this week.
   ``Only a miracle can save it now,'' Roald Z. Sagdeyev, head of
the Soviet Space Research Institute, said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Ground-control operators are unable to communicate with the
Phobos 1 probe, now millions of miles from Earth.
   This week, a Soyuz TM-5 capsule carrying two cosmonauts came
close to being marooned in space because of equipment problems and
mistakes by the ship's commander delayed its return to Earth.
   Sagdeyev said scientists would now have to rely on a sister
ship, Phobos 2, that is also racing toward the Red Planet. Phobos 1
was launched July 7 and Phobos 2 five days later in missions that
cost $480 million.
   The probes were scheduled to go into orbit around Mars and in
January drop behind Phobos, the larger of the planet's two moons,
to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and magnetic field.
   Phobos 1 was to drop a lander that would stay in one place on
the surface of the moon for a year. Phobos 2 was to deploy a lander
that would hop around on the moon in 20-yard leaps, gathering and
analyzing soil samples.
   Phobos 1 is still moving in space, but it may not be on its
planned trajectory because the orientation and guidance systems
aren't functioning. It was not immediately known how the original
plan would be modified now that one of the probes is useless.
   Sagdeyev said a ground control operator at the Soviet Mission
Control Center near Moscow sent an incorrect command to Phobos 1
during the night of Aug. 29-30 and that a computer failed to detect
the error and flash the signal, ``bad command.'' He did not say
whether the faulty computer was on the ground or on board the
spacecraft.
   ``The command signified the slow suicide of the machinery,
Phobos 1,'' said Sagdeyev. ``It lost orientation, and the solar
panels stopped looking at the sun. In two to three days a
cooling-down of the craft occurred.''
   ``The machinery has simply frozen. It fell into a deep,
lethargic sleep,'' the scientist said.
   The mistake was only discovered three days later. Sagdeyev said
investigators also determined that no second operator was on duty
to check the work of the controller who made the mistake, violating
the control center's rules. He did not say if either controller was
punished.
   Sagdeyev, the most prominent Soviet space scientist and a major
supporter of the exploration of Mars, said ground controllers were
still sending signals to Phobos 1 to restore orientation, but were
having no luck. He suggested they now turn their attention to
Phobos 2 and ``do everything to prevent a repetition of the mistake
with the second machine.''
   The space research chief spoke to a reporter during a reception
at the U.S. ambassador's residence in honor of Andrei D. Sakharov,
the Soviet physicist and human rights activist who is the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   On Tuesday, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Lyakhov and his Afghan
crewmate, Ahad Abdul Mohmand, had to postpone landing of their
Soyuz TM-5 capsule because a sensor used to orient the craft and a
computer malfunctioned.
   In addition to the equipment problems, Lyakhov said later he
acted improperly during one landing attempt and made the problems
worse. The two, who were running low on air and food, returned to
Earth safely Wednesday.
   NASA, the American National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, was to have helped the Soviets track Phobos 1 next
month, but NASA official Raymond J. Amorose said Thursday the
Soviets reported they lost contact with the craft.
   NASA was also supposed to have worked with Phobos 1 in a joint
U.S.-Soviet study of the sun.
   The Tass news agency indicated that scientists were in normal
contact with Phobos 2 and said it was 11.8 million miles from Earth.
   After a 111 million-mile trip, both craft were to have fallen
into orbit behind Phobos for a three-month remote study meant to
help unlock mysteries of Mars, which some scientists believe may
once have hosted life. In April, the craft were to drop out of
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,
where they were to release two small landers.
   It is the most ambitious of about 18 Soviet and U.S. unmanned
missions to study Mars, which, next to Venus, is believed to be
most like Earth.

   Thousands of ethnic Germans from
eastern Europe are coming to West Germany, and state officials are
seeking ways to cope with the burden on schools, housing and social
services.
   Several state leaders met Friday with federal officials to
discuss the crisis. They are demanding the government pay a larger
share of the added costs.
   More than 200,000 people, almost all of them ethnic Germans, are
expected to arrive in West Germany this year from the Soviet Union,
Poland and other east European countries. The same number is
expected next year.
   Although German by heritage, many do not speak the German
language.
   Government facilities have long since overflowed, and many
newcomers are housed in gymnasiums and other makeshift quarters.
   The influx is in large part the result of a change of policy in
many East bloc countries. Although the Bonn government has worked
for years to gain permission for ethnic Germans to emigrate, it was
not prepared for the response.
   ``We've got to get these people out of gymnasiums,'' Herbert
Schnoor, interior minister for North Rhein Westfalia state, told
reporters at a press conference in Bonn.
   Schnoor was among the state officials who met with government
leaders Friday.
   The federal government has proposed a $450 million program to
build 30,000 new apartments. State leaders are demanding a $1.9
billion program to build 54,000 new apartments.
   ``These people are being found housing, but not in the manner we
would like,'' Schnoor said.
   He said the government must provide an additional $405 million
in emergency help.
   ``Without this money, we can't begin to solve the problem,''
Schnoor said.
   Schnoor said Chancellor Helmut Kohl was receptive to the
suggestions and that he made it clear that solutions ``would not
break down because of financial disputes.''
   The majority of the ethnic Germans are from Poland and the
Soviet Union, government officials said. The Soviet Union alone has
granted exit visas to 15,715 ethnic Germans this year.
   Bavarian Interior Minister Max Streibl said the federal
government should pay two-thirds of the costs, leaving the states
to pay the final third.
   Three government crisis groups have been formed, and the
Interior Ministry is developing an overall program in conjunction
with the Housing Ministry. The Chancellor's Office is working on a
program of language instruction and job placement for the
immigrants.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, seeking a greater federal
role in promoting the family institution, ordered departments and
agencies Friday to report quickly on ways the government can better
protect men, women, children and the unborn.
   Following up on his 1986 State of the Union pledge to thoroughly
analyze the state of families in America, Reagan accepted a series
of recommendations by his White House Office of Policy Development
on how to build family cohesiveness.
   Several of the new initiatives would be focused on the drug
abuse problem, and Reagan embraced a call for making the receipt of
federal funds contingent on the willingness of educational and
other institutions to promote drug-free environments.
   He also backed a proposal to find safeguards designed to protect
the newborn and the unborn against possible exploitation in medical
research experimentation and organ transplantation.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said no final decisions
had been made on a possible executive order to ban the use of
tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses.
   He labeled as ``premature'' news accounts to that such decisions
had been made.
   Reagan's directive to several departments and agencies was aimed
at implementing, among other things, these policy changes:
   _Ensure that family violence ``be treated by law enforcement
agencies as a criminal law violation, not primarily a social
service problem.''
   _Require that legislation being considered by either the House
or the Senate be accompanied by a ``family impact'' statement.
   _Make the receipt of federal grant funds for education and other
purposes contingent on an institution's demonstrated ability to
move toward creation of a drug-free environment.
   _Create new federal initiatives, particularly within the
Agriculture Department, to push the use of housing vouchers to
improve housing opportunities in rural America.
   _Seek to have federal human sexuality and family planning
educational and informational materials promote sexual abstinence
among young people and to prevent the use of federal money for the
distribution of contraceptives in schools without parental
permission.
   _Have the Department of Housing and Urban Development find a way
to ``substantially increase resident management and ownership of
public housing projects.''
   _Develop legislative proposals requiring mandatory minimum
sentences for those who sell and distribute drugs to minors and
those who use adolescents in the trafficking of drugs.
   _Reassess how current tax laws affect the institution of the
family.
   The White House report voiced reservations about a push by
Congress to have the federal government play a larger role in
supporting and financing day care centers.
   ``Many proposals currently pending in Congress would subsidize
only daycare centers but would provide no assistance for families
who choose other child care options such as an extended family
member or neighbor,'' it said.
   Reagan instructed the various departments and agencies to report
back to him no later than December, one month before he leaves
office.
   Fitzwater acknowledged that the Reagan family initiatives were
coming late in the administration but said many could be achieved
by executive orders and actions rather than through congressional
legislation.
   The move to protect newborns and unborns against medical
experimentation was among the most controversial of the initiatives
laid out in the report on families.
   The administration moved to prohibit the use of tissue from
intentionally aborted fetuses in research before a special National
Institutes of Health advisory committee meets on this matter Sept.
14 and 15.
   Gary L. Bauer, Reagan's assistant for policy development and
principal author of the report on families, told Health and Human
Services Secretary Otis R. Bowen he wanted the secretary's comments
on a proposed executive order quickly.
   A copy of Bauer's memo, dated Sept. 2, along with a copy of a
draft presidential executive order that Reagan would sign, was
obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.

   Mayor Andrew Young defended on Thursday the
assignment of a county deputy to the Martin Luther King Jr. Center
for Nonviolent Social Change and the family of the slain civil
rights leader.
   Atlanta also has a police officer stationed at the center as his
regular ``base of operations,'' Young said.
   Young said he was concerned that recent media reports have
``singled out'' the publicly financed security, and he described
the King family as ``a valuable asset to the city.''
   ``Whatever it takes to see that they function safely and
securely, we have an interest in maintaining,'' he said.
   Fulton County Sheriff Richard B. Lankford said last week he
assigned a deputy full time to the King Center to serve as a
``security consultant'' and to protect the King family, including
King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and his son, Fulton County
Commissioner Martin Luther King III.
   Young, who was one of King's lieutenants in the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference and is a member of the King Center
board of directors, said the city has contributed about $23,000 to
the center this year.
   ``I wish we could do more,'' he added.
   The King Center, visited by an estimated 800,000 people
annually, is one of the state's most popular tourist destinations,
he said.
   The city, Young said, routinely provides police details for such
attractions as the High Museum of Art and Zoo Atlanta.
   He added that the city also sends 25 to 50 officers to Atlanta
Braves baseball games, where they perform duties ranging from
security and crowd control to traffic direction.
   ``The King Center outdraws all of them, but it brings with it a
unique set of problems, and one of the problems is security,'' he
said. ``It's one of those kinds of places where the nuts seem to
gather.''

<HEAD>Quayle Gets Skeptical Reception From Ohio Steelworkers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MASSILLON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle got a polite but skeptical
reception from largely pro-Democratic steelworkers Friday at a
factory where the Republican vice presidential nominee touted his
support for job training and curbs on foreign steel imports.
   His motorcade whizzed past about 150 union demonstrators who
chanted ``Go Home'' at an entrance to the Mercury Stainless Inc.
plant, which he toured wearing a hard hat.
   Other protesters carried placards reading ``Open Season on
Quayle'' and ``I Toured Nam, Not Indiana,'' a reference to Quayle's
service in the Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War.
   The Indiana senator told the workers, many of whom stood
silently wearing Dukakis-Bentsen T-shirts, that he had fought to
protect American steelworkers against foreign imports. He also said
the Job Partnership Training Act he had cosponsored in the Senate
had helped their plant when it emerged from bankruptcy.
   He later told a Canton, Ohio, Rotary Club luncheon that 88,000
people had received job training under the law, and that 62 percent
had found work.
   Some of the Mercury demonstrators joined several hundred
supporters of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis who picketed the
luncheon site.
   ``You are to be congratuled,'' Quayle told the Mercury
employees, who applauded politely. ``You are a success story and
you did it yourself. You did it through partnership, a partnership
of labor and management.''
   The plant was closed because of bankruptcy in February 1985,
shortly after the Justice Department ordered it sold to facilitate
the merger of LTD and Republic Steel. Mercury then bought the plant
and reopened it in October 1986.
   Plant vice president Rick Harbert said 193 workers had been
trained under the law, using $191,000 in federal funds.
   Quayle took credit for lobbying President Reagan to support
so-called voluntary restraint agreements under which foreign steel
imports are restricted.
   He said he had preferred import quota legislation, which Reagan
didn't like, but that the restraint agreements ``did offer some
relief.''
   ``I wasn't afraid to co-sponsor that (quota) bill,'' he said.
``I wasn't afraid to stand up for the steelworkers of Indiana or
the steelworkers of Ohio or the steelworkers of America because we
said `enough is enough'.''
   Though silent during Quayle's speech, some Mercury employees
were not reticent about expressing their opinions to reporters.
   ``Hogwash. We don't buy it,'' said plant electrician Mike
McElfresh after Quayle spoke.
   Others said Quayle and GOP presidential nominee George Bush
would have trouble justifying Quayle's vigorous opposition to
legislation requiring 60 days' advance notice of mass layoffs or
plant closings, which Reagan vetoed in its original form.
   ``They've come to the wrong place,'' fumed machinery operator
John Ledrich, who criticized Quayle for his position on the
plant-closings bill. But Ledrich said Mercury management had asked
Dukakis supporters to be polite to Quayle and ``make him feel at
home.''
   Said mechanic Brian Reamy: ``It takes a lot of courage to come
in here in the middle of a highly unionized place.''
   Quayle adviser Jim Cicconi said he was pleased with the
candidate's performance in Massillon. He said that at Quayle's
pre-speech meeting with plant officials and union leaders, ``we
were told he would get more boos than cheers.''

   In a stunning reversal of a half-century of
Communist orthodoxy, Pravda on Friday acknowledged that Leon
Trotsky played a key role in the Russian Revolution before he was
purged by Stalin and murdered in exile.
   ``During the years of revolution and civil war, the most popular
leader after Lenin was Trotsky,'' declared Soviet historian Col.
Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov using language that might once have cost a
Soviet citizen his life.
   The full-page article in the Communist Party newspaper, an
excerpt from a biography Volkogonov is writing of Stalin, is the
latest example of the Kremlin's new willingness to confront
long-hidden aspects of Soviet history.
   It represents a significant change in the official media's
treatment of Trotsky, the golden-tongued, hot-tempered
revolutionary who was long reviled officially as a traitor and
accused of heading an anti-Soviet plot.
   But the title chosen by Pravda for the article _ ``The Demon of
the Revolution'' _ showed that Soviet officialdom still apparently
opposes any full rehabilitation of Trotsky, who was killed in 1940
in Mexico City, reportedly on orders of Josef Stalin.
   In a forward, Pravda pointedly noted that Soviet founder
Vladimir I. Lenin called Trotsky a ``Judas'' in 1911 and that he
joined Lenin's Bolsheviks only in 1917, the year they seized power
after the overthrow of the Russian czar.
   But Pravda added: ``Having his share of the abilities of a
publicist, orator, and organizer, Trotksy played a well known role
in the October armed uprising, and in the years of the civil war,
when he was people's commissar for war and naval affairs and
chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council.''
   That ``well known role'' was expunged from the official Soviet
record during Stalin's 29-year rule, when documents and even
photographs that showed Trotsky at historic events or at Lenin's
side were doctored to remove him.
   Under Stalin, those suspected of being ``Trotskyites'' _ the
most loathesome appellation in the Soviet political lexicon _ were
hunted down, and then imprisoned or killed.
   Trotsky, the son of a prosperous Jewish farmer, helped direct
the 1917 coup that brought the Bolsheviks to power in Russia. As a
deputy to Lenin, he was first commissar for foreign affairs, then
commissar for war, creating and commanding the Red Army in a civil
war against counterrevolutionaries.
   He is known as the main advocate of the ``Theory of Permament
Revolution,'' which held that the Russian revolution was a prelude
to a rising by the proletariat throughout Europe.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a major speech last Nov.
2, became the first Soviet leader in decades to mention Trotsky
publicly, but he condemned the call for world revolution.
   ``This was essentially an attack on Leninism all down the
line,'' Gorbachev said. ``The party's leading nucleus headed by
Josef Stalin safeguarded Leninism in an ideological struggle.''
   Since Gorbachev's speech, however, the Kremlin's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness, has been broadened to include sharper
attacks on the political terror and rigid centralized management
system that were hallmarks of Stalin's rule.
   Some other prominent Stalin foes killed in the 1930s purges,
like Nikolai Bukharin, whose ideas are similar to those advocated
by Gorbachev, were cleared this year of the criminal charges used
to justify their executions.
   Volkogonov wrote: ``There are grounds to consider that Trotsky,
during the years of his most active participation in party life
(1917-24), was not an enemy of the revolution and of socialism. But
already at that time, he was an enemy of Stalin.''
   After the death of Lenin in 1924, Stalin rallied his forces
under the slogan of ``Socialism in One Country.'' He argued against
Trotsky that a socialist state should be created first in the
Soviet Union without waiting for worldwide revolution.
   Stalin forced Trotsky out of the Communist Party in 1927 and out
of the Soviet Union two years later.
   ``The tribute must be paid to Trotsky: he did not break down as
did most of the people facing the dictatorship of Stalin,'' the
Pravda article said.
   Both of Lenin's lieutenants wanted to become his political heir,
but neither Stalin nor Trotsky was suited to lead the Communist
Party or fledgling Soviet state, Volkogonov wrote.
   ``The great misfortune for history and the people was that when
the old Leninist guard was left without Lenin, it removed one from
the helm, but left the other one on the captain's bridge of the
party. But both should have been removed,'' Volkogonov said.

<TEXT>
   A chunk of a mountain
nearly two miles wide that collapsed and killed 76 people has
created a dam across two swollen rivers, and floods could hit
nearby villages, officials said Friday.
   Authorities evacuated hundreds of people after the mud slide
Tuesday, which swept away five villages.
   John Giheno, the minister for state, said an unknown number of
people were still missing. Officials said the death toll would have
been higher if children had not been at school when the slide hit.
   National Broadcasting Radio said geologists expect more
landslides that could lead to a higher death toll in remote Morobe
Province, about 185 miles north of Port Moresby, the capital.
   Local radio reports said Tuesday's mud slide sent millions of
tons of mud and debris into two valleys and created an artifical
dam across two flooded rivers. The water buildup is threatening
more villages, and army engineers joined rescue workers in trying
to release the flood waters, the radio said.
   Officials were trying to resettle more than 600 people left
homeless, and crosses were erected to mark the site as an official
burial ground, the radio said.
   The Australian Associated Press said the slide appeared caused
by volcanic activity, not heavy rains. The news agency said the
debris filled the valleys to a depth of 500 feet and covered an
estimated nine square miles.
   It said the body of a young woman was recovered shortly after
the landslide while a man was pulled alive from the dirt by his
wife, who watched two of their children disappear.
   The villages are about 4,950 feet above sea level. Houses in the
area are mainly flimsy traditional grass-thatched structures built
on stilts. Villagers exist by raising pigs and farming sweet
potatoes.
   The AAP reported that relief supplies were arriving in the area,
and a national disaster relief committee appealed for clothing,
blankets and food for the victims.
   Two Royal Australian Air Force planes were standing by to
airlift supplies to Lae, the nearest town, officials said.
   Papua New Guinea, north of Australia, has a mainly Melanesian
population of 3.3 million.

   A week of rains in southern China has left 58
people dead, 505 injured and about 300,000 residents stranded, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Friday.
   It was the first official word of casualties in the flooding,
which followed heavy rains in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
that borders Vietnam. The report said the floods have caused about
$250 million in damage.
   The deaths bring to 1,464 the official count of people killed in
flooding in China this summer, the rainy season in much of the
country.
   The toll is believed to be the highest since 1981, when floods
in southwest China killed 3,000 people.
   Xinhua said the Guangxi Zhuang government has set aside $2.7
million to rebuild damaged transportation, communications and power
stations. But shortages of building materials were hampering the
work.
   About 300,000 people were stranded by the flooding of the
Hongshui and Liujiang rivers or were forced to evacuate their
homes, Xinhua said.
   Nearly 3 million acres of cropland, 250,000 houses, and hundreds
of factories and schools were flooded, it said.
   Previous Xinhua reports on the flooding said it was the worst in
the region since 1949.

<TEXT>
   The House on Friday refused to go along with a
Senate expansion of Medicaid to cover abortions for rape and incest
victims, prolonging an impasse over a $140 billion social spending
bill.
   The vote, after several hours of impassioned debate, was 216-166.
   House and Senate negotiators came to agreement on every aspect
of the massive Labor, Education and Health and Human Services
spending bill except the abortion section.
   The controversy stems from Senate approval on July 27 of an
amendment permitting Medicaid funding in cases of promptly reported
rape or incest. States would still have the option of barring
payments for all abortions except those necessary to save a woman's
life.
   It was the first time either chamber had voted to liberalize
Medicaid abortion eligibility since 1981. Existing law permits
federal Medicaid money to be spent on abortions only where the life
of the mother is endangered.
   President Reagan is threatening to veto the entire
appropriations bill over the abortion provision, putting the Senate
under enormous pressure to surrender to the House and retain
existing law.
   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the Senate
could take up the spending bill and the abortion amendment as early
as Monday.
   Much of the House debate reflected the conflicting bedrock
beliefs of the members. Some argued for compassionate and humane
treatment of women victimized by brutal crimes; others focused on
the welfare of the fetus.
   ``You can't avoid injustice in a rape situation. You can't avoid
injustice in an incest situation. But why compound the injustice by
putting on top of it exterminating an innocent human life?'' asked
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., author of the existing Medicaid abortion
policy.
   ``Don't make us a part of that double tragedy,'' Hyde said.
``Out of great, great tragedy, some good can come.''
   Hyde allies also said medical procedures are available to
prevent conception after rapes or incest, and contended the
proposed exceptions would turn women into liars in their efforts to
secure government-funded abortions.
   Proponents of the expanded eligibility said it was only fair to
give a poor woman the same medical choices available to a woman
with money.
   ``All this amendment says is that ... she, not I, not you,
should be able to make that choice... without regard to whether she
is rich or poor, if her state allows that choice,'' said Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis.
   Kate Michaelman, president of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, issued a statement that assumed the Senate would
give in to the House next week. ``We are disappointed but not
defeated,'' she said. ``We shall redouble our efforts with the new
Congress and the new administration and we'll try again.''
   Before embarking on the abortion debate, the House voted 335-60
to approve the other portions of the $140 billion, fiscal 1989
spending bill for the three federal agencies.
   The bill includes, among other things, $1.2 billion for AIDS
research, treatment, prevention and education; $4.3 billion in

   Boston University plans to revive dormitory rules
barring students from having overnight guests of the opposite sex
and reducing the amount of alcohol brought into their rooms.
   ``Twenty years ago, there was a move toward openness, and now
the pendulum is swinging back,'' said university spokesman Kevin
Carleton. ``Many people, including students, their parents and
college administrators, have seen that wide open dorms of years
past did not work well for the serious student.''
   The new parietal rules came partly in response to complaints
from parents, including a letter from the mother of a female
student whose roommate frequently entertained a boyfriend
overnight, Carleton said.
   Ronald L. Carter, dean of students, declined to comment until
after the rules are officially released Sept. 15.
   At present, as many as four guests can sign into a dormitory
room and stay overnight if all roommates and resident assistants
agree.
   Under the new guidelines, which Carleton said go into effect in
late fall, guests must hand in identification cards and leave the
dormitory by 11 p.m. on weekdays or 1 a.m. on weekends.
   Overnight stays by members of the same sex will be allowed if
roommates agree. But members of the opposite sex will not be
allowed overnight, officials said.
   Greg Lang, editor of the college newspaper, the Daily Free
Press, said Friday that ``we sense a lot of students are very
unhappy'' with the plan, which he said would be difficult to
enforce.
   ``Compared to a lot of issues on campus, this really hits home
with the majority of students,'' Lang said. ``If they do go ahead
and put this into practice, there'll be a lot of students opposed
to it, and who knows what will happen. Right now it's a
wait-and-see situation.''
   Parietal rules were abandoned by many American colleges and
universities, including BU, in the 1960s and 1970s, at the same
time that coeducational dormitories were instituted. Such rules
remain mostly at smaller colleges with strong religious
affiliations.
   Carleton said the applicant pool for BU's freshman class has
increased dramatically in recent years, allowing the university to
choose serious students who prefer a traditional lifestyle. The
3,650 students in this year's freshman class were selected from
23,921 applicants, 4,000 more than last year.
   ``We're providing the kind of housing serious students want and
need,'' Carleton said. ``We are recognizing our obligation as
university administrators and not as the operators of hotels or
apartment houses.''

   Is togetherness out of fashion for the rich?
That's one way to interpret the new Christmas catalog from
Neiman-Marcus, the Dallas-based department store that offers
holiday goodies for conspicuous consumers.
   Nearly every year since 1960, Neiman-Marcus has offered
his-and-hers gifts for those with a touch of whimsy and a ton of
money. There have been his-and-hers airplanes, submarines,
bathtubs, camels, buffalos, windmills, ostriches, diamonds,
dirigibles and hot-air balloons.
   This year's centerpiece, announced Friday, is another hot-air
balloon _ for one. It's labeled ``his-or-hers.''
   ``That's because it only seats one person,'' said Neiman-Marcus
spokeswoman Jan Roberts, who said there wasn't any deeper meaning
behind the gift. ``It could be a his balloon or a hers balloon.''
   The balloon, which attaches to the pilot like a backpack, is
being offered for $18,000, well under the price of some past
Christmas gifts.
   Not to worry, though. For those who want to be together, the
store also is offering customized Harley-Davidson motorcycles at
$25,000 each, with matching his-and-hers helmets and jackets, and
bicycle tours of Italy's Tuscany region at $25,000 _ for two.

   ``Something there is that doesn't love a
wall,'' Robert Frost wrote, but that's something a gentleman farmer
can't agree with.
   Robert T. Vanderbilt was so upset a part of an old stone wall on
his property was taken apart by neighbors that he called upon a
19th-century tradition to settle the dispute.
   The law calls for town selectmen to become ``fence viewers'' and
settle such disputes for a fee of $2 each.
   The neighbors, Jack and Nancy Oken, are willing to replace as
much stone as their builder took _ four truckloads _ but they
maintain that the wall was nothing more than a pile of rocks. The
builder used the stones in constructing their home.
   Vanderbilt wants them to rebuild the wall. The section in
dispute is about 3 feet high and 600 feet long.
   Fairfield's three selectmen this week agreed with the Okens that
the wall was a little more than a pile of stones, and said the
neighbors were only obligated to replace the rocks.
   Vanderbilt must now decide how much he loves a wall. He's
received estimates from contractors of $22 a foot, not including
materials, to rebuild it.

   Those attending the Beer Can
Collectors of America were busy Friday swapping cans and tales _
and drinking a little beer.
   An estimated 53 kegs of beer were expected to be polished off
during the 18th annual Beer CANvention.
   But, said organizer John McGuire, ``that isn't counting all the
cans of beers sitting in ice in our bathtubs.''
   McGuire has collected about 5,000 cans since he started his
hobby in 1964. He estimates there are about 21,000 varieties of
beer cans that have been made in the United States since the 1930s.
About 1,100 beer can enthusiasts are attending the convention,
which ends Saturday.
   What's the most popular beer at the convention? ``As long as
it's cold and wet and has suds, they'll drink it,'' said
convention-goer Robert Leslie of Worthington, Ohio.

<HEAD>Heavy Smokers Show Significantly Higher Leukemia Death Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death rate from leukemia was nearly 60 percent
higher among smokers of more than 10 cigarettes a day than among
non-smokers, according to a study published Friday.
   While no direct link has been established between smoking and
leukemia, research published in the British Medical Journal showed
that the leukemia death rate among people who smoked fewer than 10
cigarettes a day was 34 percent higher than among non-smokers.
   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day it was 57 percent, and
for smokers of 21 or more cigarettes 63 percent, the study showed.
   ``If the findings in our study represented a direct relationship
between smoking and leukemia, then it must follow that smoking is
responsible for more cases of leukemia than all the hitherto
established causes combined,'' said Dr. Leo Kinlen, director of the
Cancer Epidemiology Unit at the University of Edinburgh.
   Kinlen conducted the study of 248,000 U.S. military veterans
with E. Rogot, a statistician at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Maryland.
   They wrote that it was ``the largest study of leukemia and
smoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence that
leukemia is a smoking-related disease.''
   In an editorial in the prestigious weekly, Professor Nicholas
Wald of St. Bartholemew's Hospital in London cautioned that no
cause-and-effect relationship had been established.
   But he added: ``Whatever the mechanism, the balance of evidence
suggests that smoking may cause leukemia.''
   It should therefore be added to the World Heath Organization's
list of tobacco-related causes of death, he wrote.
   The study was conducted on data collected from 248,000 veterans
between 1954 and 1969, the researchers wrote. During that period
723 died of leukemia. Of these 330 were cigarette smokers, 185 were
ex-smokers, 46 smoked cigars or and 162 were non-smokers.
   The study found that in some types of leukemia, the death rate
among smokers was sharply higher than the average.
   Thus for monocytic and myeloid leukemias, the rate among smokers
of more than 20 cigarettes a day was 93 percent higher, compared
with 48 percent for lymphatic leukemias.
   For smokers of 10 to 20 cigarettes a day the rate of death from
lymphatic leukemia was 76 percent higher, and for one to 10
cigarettes, 40 percent higher.
   When the data was broken down into smokers and ex-smokers, it
suggested that ex-smokers also are significantly more at risk. The
death rate among smokers was 53 percent higher, and among
ex-smokers 39 percent.

<HEAD>US Increases Aid to Bangladesh Flood Victims to $150 million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration announced Friday a
series of moves that will raise U.S. assistance to flood victims in
Bangladesh to $150 million.
   Most of the increase involves reprogramming of aid funds
designed for other purposes or speeded deliveries of food grain
supplies. An estimated 73 million people, two-thirds of
Bangladesh's population, have been affected by the flooding.
   Jay Morris, the second ranking official in the Agency for
International Development, told a news conference that he would
take a relief flight Friday night carrying 2.2 million square feet
of plastic for shelters, 10,000 five-gallon water cans, 26 water
tanks with a capacity of 3,000 gallons and two water purification
units.
   The units are capable of producing nearly 5,000 gallons an hour
of pure water, Morris said.
   He was to be accompanied on the 42-hour flight by a team which
will assess emergency assistance needs in Bangladesh.
   Morris said that $60 million of U.S. food grain supplies will be
shipped immediately to Bangladesh a year ahead of schedule.
   In addition, Morris said more than $84 million dollars in U.S.
sales of food commodities which had been earmarked for development
projects are being made available for reconstruction and
rehabilitation related to flood damage.
   The Bangladesh government will make the final decision on use of
these funds.
   Morris added that a C-141 cargo plane will be sent to Bangladesh
next week, transporting six fiberglass boats, six outboard motors,
one boat trailer, 150 tents and 4,000 blankets.
   About $4.6 million had been allocated previously by the
administration for aiding the flood victims.
   Above average rainfall since the start of the 1988 monsoon
season has contributed to unprecedented flooding in Bangladesh.
   Bangladesh officials estimate that the floods have left 510
people dead and up to 28 million homeless. Much of Dhaka, the
capital, is under 3-4 feet of water.
   The charity CARE released a statement in Washington on Friday
saying the organization fears many more people will die as a result
of starvation and disease than were killed by the flood waters.
   ``Our emergency response teams are taking boats deep into the
country side and are finding thousands of stranded villagers still
clinging to rooftops,'' said Nick Weber, who oversees CARE
operations in the Dhaka area.
   He said many of the victims had had nothing to eat and no clean
water to drink since flooding began Aug. 31.
   ``Their situation is desperate, and it's not likely to get any
better for some time,'' said Weber.
   Stafford Clarry, director of CARE's overall flood-relief efforts
in Bangladesh, said officials believe the country's rice crop has
been destroyed, thus leaving farm families without any food for the
next six to nine months.

   The Egyptian navy stopped an Israeli tour ship
that apparently strayed off course Friday in the Red Sea and
detained it for five hours, the Foreign Ministry and Israel radio
reported.
   Thirty-five people were aboard, including French and West German
tourists, the reports said. Israel radio said the vessel and those
aboard were released after Egyptian diplomats intervened at
Israel's request.
   The ministry and radio reported another incident Friday in which
the Egyptian navy seized an Israeli fishing boat in the Red Sea and
took six people into custody.
   A ministry spokesman said it was not interceding for the
fishermen, detained off the Sinai Peninsula 40 miles south of Elat,
because ``If Israelis fish in Egyptian territorial water, we know
it's against the Egyptian law.''
   Several hours before the reports, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
formally accepted a U.S. invitation to a meeting on Middle East
peace Sept. 26 with President Reagan, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and Esmat Abdel-Meguid, foreign minister of Egypt.
   Interception of the cruise vessel was the most serious
Israeli-Egyptian border incident involving tourists since a berserk
Egyptian policeman opened fire in October 1985 in a Sinai desert
resort, killing six Israelis.
   Israel radio said the Egyptian gunboat Insah intercepted the
tour ship Maya south of Taba, a disputed border area.
   It said the warship rammed a hole in the Israeli vessel,
breaking water pipes. Those aboard the tour ship were 15 tourists
from France and West Germany, 15 Israeli vacationers and a five-man
Israeli crew.
   The radio quoted Capt. Moshe Saar of the Maya as saying the
Egyptians threatened his ship with guns and later jammed radio
communications.
   After a search, the Israeli vessel was towed to an Egyptian navy
base on nearby Coral Island and an Israeli navy ship in nearby
waters was told not to intervene, the radio reported.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said it was advised of the incident
at about 2 p.m. and ``we approached the Egyptian ambassador in Tel
Aviv and asked him to intervene.''
   Ministry officials also were in touch with the Egyptian military
liaison office and the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's definitely not clear to us what the boat did,'' he said.
``It was probably cruising within an area where Egyptians do not
allow our boats to cruise.''

<HEAD>Iraq to Consider Impartial Inquiry Into Chemical Weapons Charges</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This includes material from AM-Senate-Kurds for those

<TEXT>
   A senior Iraqi diplomat, again rejecting U.S.
charges his country attacked Kurdish guerrillas with chemical
weapons, offered Friday to consider an impartial inquiry into the
allegations.
   But the State Department showed no immediate interest in the
offer. Spokesman Charles E. Redman insisted that Iraq issue a
declaration disavowing the use of chemical weapons in the future.
   And on Capitol Hill, the Senate gave swift voice-vote approval
to a bill imposing stiff economic sanctions on the Arab country.
``The Iraqi army is waging a campaign against the Kurdish
population that can only be described as genocide,'' said the
measure's sponsor, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
   Sadoon Hamadi, minister of state for foreign affairs, said
observers would not be permitted in the northern border area of
Iraq, where many of the Kurds live, so long as hostilities
persisted there.
   But, he said, if the fighting subsided, ``this is a possibility,
which we will not rule out.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz told Hamadi on Thursday he
was convinced that Iraq had used poison gas against Kurdish
guerrillas. He condemned its use as ``abhorrent and unjustifiable.''
   Hamadi, at a news conference Friday, said Shultz had not
substantiated the allegation. ``No evidence was produced to us,''
he said. ``We have seen no evidence at all.''
   The Iraqi diplomat, whose meeting with Shultz initially was
scheduled to deal with sputtering efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war,
said he told Shultz the allegation was not true.
   ``I said categorically we deny this,'' he told reporters.
   Hamadi said he did not ask Shultz to provide evidence and said
he hoped U.S. relations with Iraq would continue to improve.
   The Iraqi official again accused Kurds ``manipulated'' by Iran
of spreading the accusation that Iraq used cyanide and other
chemical weapons against Kurds, killing or injuring thousands of
them.
   He said negotiations to end the eight-year Persian Gulf war were
in ``a difficult stage'' because Iran was unwilling to accept the
principle of free shipping.
   Hamadi said Iraq must have access to Shatt al Arab, historically
its only access to the gulf. Despite Iran's opposition, he said,
``We will resist any attempt to suspend the negotiations.''
   Redman, the State Department spokesman, was asked later if the
Iraqi demand for freedom of shipping had U.S. support. Noting the
United Nations is overseeing the negotiations, he replied that ``we
are not attempting to insert ourselves into these kinds of
details.''
   The sanctions bill offered by Pell, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and sent to the House, would:
   _Require the U.S. representative to international financial
institutions top vote against all loans to Iraq.
   _Bar all U.S. financial credits or guarantees to Iraq.
   _Ban the importation of Iraqi oil.
   _Forbid U.S. economic and military aid.
   _Bar the transfer of sensitive high-technology items subject to
U.S. export controls.
   ``I think this is as strong a set of sanctions as has ever been
passed,'' Pell told reporters.

<HEAD>Botha To Visit Mozambique For First Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha will make
his first official visit to neighboring, Marxist-ruled Mozambique,
the countries said Friday.
   Botha's meeting Monday with Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano will underscore the improving relations between the
long-hostile countries, although Mozambique continues to charge
that South Africa supports an 11-year-old guerrilla insurgency in
Mozambique.
   Botha, during his 10 years as head of South Africa's
white-controlled government, has paid an official visit to
Swaziland and made a secret visit to South African troops fighting
in Angola.
   But he has not made an official state visit to neighboring
Botswana, Mozambique or Zimbabwe, three of the so-called front-line
states that vehemently oppose South Africa's apartheid policies of
racial segregation.
   Mozambique's national news agency AIM, quoting unidentified
official sources in Maputo, said Botha and Chissano would meet in
the town of Songo, in the far-northern province of Tete.
   The South African Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed
Botha's visit, but did not release any details. The department also
said Botha would travel Tuesday to Malawi, the only African nation
that has full diplomatic relations with South Africa.
   The sources quoted by AIM said Botha and Chissano would discuss
``matters of common interest'' and would meet ``in the spirit of
the Nkomati Accord.''
   The accord is a mutual non-aggression treaty signed in 1984 by
Botha and Chissano's predecessor, Samora Machel, during a ceremony
at the two countries' border.
   Machel was killed in a plane crash on South African territory in
October 1986. Mozambique blamed South Africa for the crash, saying
a false radio beacon lured the plane off course, but a South
African-organized panel of international experts blamed the
accident on errors by the Soviet crew.
   Chissano, chosen in November 1986 to succeed Machel, has
increased Mozambique's contacts with the West, which now provides
extensive aid to the war- and drought-wracked country.
   The Soviet bloc continues to supply weaponry and military
training, but most Western governments support Chissano's
government and have denounced the often brutal tactics of the
rebels.
   Mozambique has repeatedly accused South Africa of violating the
1984 Nkomati Accord by assisting the Mozambique National Resistance
guerrilla movement. South Africa, which aided the rebels before the
accord, says it has halted the assistance.
   In the past year, South Africa has expanded its trade mission in
Maputo, pursued economic development possibilities in Mozambique
and revived a joint military monitoring commission established in
the Nkomati Accord.
   The two countries also have signed an agreement aimed at
rehabilitating a giant hydroelectric project near Songo so it can
purchase electricity from Mozambique.
   The Mozambique National Resistance rebels repeatedly have
sabotaged the Cahora Bassa hydroelectric project.
   Even when their relations were badly strained, Mozambique and
South Africa maintained extensive ties. Tens of thousands of
Mozambicans work as miners and migrant laborers in South Africa,
and Maputo's electricity is supplied by South Africa.
   Botha's trip comes four days before the arrival in Mozambique of
Pope John Paul II, who will be making a three-day tour at the close
of a regional trip.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle and his wife Marilyn own assets worth $1.4 million,
according to a set of financial documents made public Friday.
   The couple's worth, after allowing for a mortgage and other
debts, are listed as totaling nearly $1.2 million. Accountants also
deducted $330,000 in estimated income taxes the Quayles
theoretically would owe if they sold the assets. This yields a net
worth of $859,700.
   The couple's largest asset is a $750,000 house in McLean, Va., a
fashionable Washington suburb. They also own $500,000 in common
stock in Central Newspapers Inc., a family-owned newspaper group.
   Quayle, a senator from Indiana, also will receive future income
from the Pulliam Family Trust, a multimillion-dollar trust that
holds majority stock in Central Newspapers.
   The senator has no ownership interest in the trust and would not
begin receiving income from it until after the deaths of his
step-grandmother and his mother, according to the documents.
   Quayle also released his income tax returns for the past 10
years and a financial disclosure statement required of federal
candidates by federal law.
   The disclosure form shows that in the first seven months of
1988, Quayle collected $50,600 in speaking and writing fees in
addition to his Senate salary, which now is $89,500 a year.
   The honoraria were paid by a wide variety of interest groups,
particularly those involved in food marketing and health care.
Quayle is a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, which handles health issues.
   By law, Quayle can keep only $35,800 of his honoraria, or 40
percent of his Senate salary. The rest must be given to charity.
   The tax returns show that in 1987, the Quayles had total income
of $147,303. That amount included $54,074 in honoraria, of which
$14,262 was given to charity. The Quayles listed an additional $174
in charitable cash contributions.
   The 1987 return showed that the couple paid $25,829 in federal
taxes. Ten years earlier, when Quayle was in the House of
Representatives, they paid $12,542 in taxes on a total income of
$64,214. That included just $1,500 in honoraria, and the couple
gave $3,272 to charity that year.

<HEAD>Soviets Make Additional Purchase of American Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
350,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery in the coming year,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets in the last nine
days for delivery in the 1988-89 year that started Sept. 1 to more
than 2.6 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 350,000 tons of
corn would be about 13.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.75 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $38 million.
   As with the other recent sales, no indication was given whether
the new sales of corn to the Soviets would count under the current
long-term grain supply agreement between the two countries or be
carried forward separately in case a new pact is forthcoming.
   The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and
negotiators are trying to work out a new one, or at least an
extension of the current agreement, to take effect Oct. 1.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   Prior to sales announced since Sept. 1, the Soviet Union had
purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn
for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons
of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>Philippines Rejects U.S. Offer On Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government rejected a U.S. offer
of $502 million in annual aid in return for continued use of
military bases in the country, the foreign secretary said Friday.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus made the disclosure at a news
conference, two days before his scheduled departure for the United
States to discuss the matter with U.S. officials.
   He was asked to comment on reports quoting unidentified U.S.
State Department officials as saying the United States offered an
annual $489 million aid package in exchange for use of the six
military facilities.
   ``It would have to be unacceptable,'' Manglapus said. ``It is
probably insufficient.''
   Manglapus said the offer actually totaled $502 million and was
made by U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt when the two sides resumed
negotiations over the bases in August.
   The talks were recessed Aug. 17 because Platt had to go to
Washington for consultations. The two sides said the talks are
expected to resume this month.
   Negotiations began in April and were to have lasted three
months. But they dragged on and finally broke down over Philippine
insistence that Washington pay $1.2 billion annually for Subic
Naval Base, Clark Air Base and four smaller installations.
   Asked if he would insist on the same figure when he meets with
U.S. officials, Manglapus replied, ``Oh, yes. We shall be
clarifying that our position is reasonable.''
   Manglapus is to meet Secretary of State George Shultz, Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci and members of Congress.
   Under an agreement that expires in 1991, the United States gives
the Philippines $180 million a year through 1989. The talks are to
determine the amount of compensation for the remaining two years.
   Sources close to the talks say the Americans refuse to give in
to the Philippine demands because of uncertainty they will be
allowed to keep the bases after 1991.
   President Corazon Aquino, who is under pressure not to renew the
pact, has not disclosed her position. She says she wants to keep
her options open until 1990.

<HEAD>Young Hemophiliac Afraid Of AIDS Test; Wants Change In
Name-Disclosure Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old hemophiliac says he is
afraid to be tested for AIDS because he might lose his friends and
he wants the state to stop mandatory identification of those who
test positive for the AIDS virus.
   The boy said he worries constantly that he is infected with
AIDS, but is afraid that if he tests positive his name might be
leaked from state files.
   The boy and his mother agreed to be interviewed by The Arizona
Daily Star on the condition that they not be identified by name.
   ``I told this friend I have hemophilia and he went and told his
mom, and she said I couldn't come over no more,'' he said.
   Twenty-nine doctors, lawyers and others have signed a petition
on the boy's behalf, and it is to be presented Monday to state
Health Director Ted Williams.
   The petition asks that the state drop the requirement for
reporting by name those people who test positive for the human
immunodeficiency virus that causes to AIDS.
   ``I'd be helping all the other hemophiliacs and all the people
with AIDS in Arizona,'' the boy said.
   Hemophilia is a hereditary condition in which one of the normal
blood-clotting factors is absent, causing prolonged bleeding from
even minor cuts and injuries. It occurs in males, and is
transmitted by females.
   Hemophiliacs and others who received blood transfusions before
1985, when screening became available, were at risk of being
infected with the AIDS virus.
   The boy has had at least 45 transfusions since 1981, his mother
said.
   Williams told The Associated Press on Friday that his department
is working on strengthening the confidentiality policy for AIDS
patients, rather than dropping the requirement that names be
reported.
   ``This child is making our case for us,'' Williams said. ``He's
concerned about getting tested because he's worried the information
will somehow leak out.''
   The boy, who moved from Indiana to Tucson this summer, is a
former schoolmate of Ryan White, the Indiana boy who was barred
from public school in 1985 after he contracted AIDS from a blood
transfusion.
   White, also a hemophiliac, returned to school under court order,
and he and his family later moved to another Indiana town.
   The 11-year-old talked of being harassed and shunned by
schoolmates in Indiana who thought that because he was a
hemophiliac, he must also have AIDS.
   ``Before you know it, you're sitting on one end of the
playground and nobody's sitting with you, and you don't know why,''
he said.
   Williams would not discuss the specifics of the proposed changes
in the law because they are still in draft form. One change would
allow the state to notify school districts of students who had
tested positive.
   Williams said any changes would require public hearings.
   ``We want people to come and get tested. We want them to know.
That's the best way we have to fight this epidemic,'' Williams
added.

   A Honduran security guard
accidentally shot and killed a Peace Corp trainee from Ohio, a U.S.
Embassy spokeswoman said Friday.
   Spokeswoman Anne Sigmund identified the victim as Matthew N.
Sherman, 22, of Minister, Ohio. Two Honduran security guards were
in police custody, she said.
   She said Sherman died Thursday night after being shot by one of
the two guards as he entered the Peace Corps training center at El
Rincon, a suburb of the capital of Tegucigalpa.
   ``Details of the incident are sketchy,'' Ms. Sigmund said in a

   Sherman, who had been training in Honduras for about 10 weeks,
was to be sworn in as a regular member of the corps on Friday.
   The embassy could provide no other details on the incident or

<HEAD>British Officer Testifies at Inquest into IRA Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British officer involved in the shooting
deaths of three IRA agents told an inquest Friday his commando
unit's mission was to arrest the three, disarm them and defuse a
car bomb they were believed ready to detonate.
   He said intelligence received in Gibraltar two days before the
shootings described the IRA members as ``dedicated and ruthless
terrorists who were likely to carry arms and who had explosives
ready to construct a bomb.''
   The three proved to be unarmed. Critics of British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's government cited the shootings as
evidence that her government is implementing an unofficial
``shoot-to-kill'' policy against IRA active members believed on
attack missions against British targets.
   The officer testified on the fourth day of the inquest by
Coroner Felix Pizzarello and an 11-member jury into the March 6
shooting deaths of Sean Savage, 24, Mairead Farrell, 31, and Daniel
McCann, 31.
   The IRA has acknowledged the three were on active service when
killed.
   The witness was one of seven British Special Air Services (SAS)
officers involved in the incident in this British fortress colony.
His elite regiment is used by Britain in anti-terrorist operations
against the Irish Republican Army.
   He was identified only as `F'' for security reasons and was
concealed from the view of public and press by a curtain.
   The officer testified that when the Gibraltar police commisioner
turned over control to the military to detain the IRA suspects,
just before the shootings, they were given permission to use
``lethal force in the preservation of life.''
   ``We had been told that the IRA was under pressure to produce a
spectacular attack,'' `F' testified, adding that it was believed
the attack would consist of setting off a car bomb March 8 during a
ceremonial changing of the guard in the center of Gibraltar.
   ``We were also informed that the (IRA) active service unit was
made up of McCann, Farrell and Savage.''
   The inquest has no power of prosecution. If the inquest jury
hands down a verdict of unlawful killing, the Gibraltar attorney
general is expected to return criminal indictments.

<HEAD>Deadline Extended to Take Bids on PTL</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The PTL bankruptcy trustee Friday
extended indefinitely the deadline to accept bids for the ministry,
and said Jim Bakker provided no proof he has the money to back up
his $172 million offer to buy back the television network and
religious theme park he founded.
   Bakker left a two-hour meeting with trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton
at PTL's executive offices behind two security guards who knocked
down several television cameramen in their rush to leave the
building at PTL's Heritage USA Christian theme park.
   Bakker would only tell reporters: ``We're all working on it.
It's going good. It's going great.''
   Neither Bakker nor his attorney, Jim Toms, could be reached for
further comment.
   Benton, however, said: ``I think he's exhausted ... about all
offers he can in this situation. Certainly we were not assured''
that Bakker has the funds.
   When asked if Bakker's deal was falling through, Benton said,
``Evidently it's not obvious to him (Bakker).''
   The trustee said the latest deadline he had set to accept offers
for the ministry _ 5 p.m. Friday _ has been extended indefinitely.
   And he said he may soon talk to Canadian real estate executive
Peter Thomas, who had offered $113 million for PTL but withdrew the
offer earlier this week.
   ``I want to make it clear that we can't tell you anything
positive today,'' Benton told reporters. ``We're sort of in a
quandary at this point. We may be at that point where we talk to
him (Thomas).''
   Benton had given Bakker until Friday to come up with $3 million
to secure his officer and to show proof that funds exist for the
overall loan.
   PTL filed for protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Columbia, S.C., in June 1987, three months after Bakker admitted
having a sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and
left the ministry.
   Benton, who met Thursday with unidentified Canadian investors
who were interested in buying the ministry's assets, has said he is
considering other offers. He did say the investors were not Thomas
or his associates.
   Benton has declined to give details of those offers. He said he
will report the status of negotiations to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Rufus Reynolds on Monday. The judge had said he wanted Benton to
recommend a buyer by that point.

<HEAD>Up to 111,854 Officially, Could Be 300,000, WHO Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of AIDS cases worldwide reported to the
World Health Organization rose to 111,854 at the end of August, but
the true number of victims is likely to be as high as 300,000, the
U.N. agency said Friday.
   The figure of 111,854, a cumulative total since officials began
recording cases in the early 1980s, represents an increase of 3,678
reported cases in August, WHO said in a news release.
   It said the WHO's Global Program on AIDS ``now estimates the
actual cumulative number of AIDS cases to date at approximately
250,000-300,000, or more than twice the number of officially
reported cases.''
   Of 177 countries which report to the WHO, 140 report having AIDS
victims while 37 say they have no cases, it said.
   Of the total cases reported, 19,097 were diagnosed so far this
year, the news release said.
   Among countries reporting an increase in victims during August
were the United States, up 2,086 to 71,171, France, up 583 to
4,211, and Italy, up 368 to 2,233 cases.
   No Latin American countries provided updated figures in August.
Brazil had the highest number of cases, 2,956 reported in April of
1988, followed by Mexico with 1,302, also reported in April.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by a
virus that attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
unborn babies.

<DATELINE>SHOSHONE NATIONAL FOREST, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atop Clay Butte Lookout
near the northern border of the Shoshone National Forest, Pat Moore
can't see the fires for the smoke.
   But she knows the flames are out there, burning wildly in and
around Yellowstone National Park to the west, southwest and south
of the U.S. Forest Service lookout tower built in 1942.
   Moore, a Forest Service secretary normally based in Atlanta, and
Verna Nachu, a Bureau of Indian Affairs employee from White River,
Ariz., help fight the flames by relaying communications between
fire camps.
   ``They normally use us for repeater service,'' Nachu, said
between communications Thursday evening. ``They call us human
repeaters.''
   Sitting at 9,811 feet, the lookout tower's radio messages are
unimpeded by the surrounding mountains, which frequently block
communications among the fire camps based on the forest floor.
   On clear days from their glassy perch Moore and Nachu can see
the huge columns of smoke rising from forest fires in both the
Shoshone and adjacent Yellowstone. At night, flames dance wildly in
the dark.
   On Thursday, though, wind from the west encapsulated the lookout
in a thick haze of smoke, visibility to several hundred yards.
   ``We had beautiful weather until the wind changed and the smoke
came this way. We really had a beautiful vantage point for
watching,'' Moore said.
   Before fires surrounded nearby Cooke City and Silver Gate,
Mont., the two women had frequent visitors when townspeople stopped
by to watch the fires.
   ``They ask a lot of questions about the fire,'' said Moore.
``Naturally they were concerned about their homes, their friends'
homes.''
   Moore, who spent 30 days in California last summer during the
fire season, is in the middle of her third week in Wyoming, her
first visit to the Rockies, and is in no rush to leave.
   ``It is magnificent,'' she said of of the surrounding
countryside. ``It's so different from what I'm used to. I've never
seen the wildlife that I see here.''
   She said she daily spots moose, deer, elk and grouse, although
she has yet to spot a grizzly bear.
   She does admit, though, that at times the lookout post can be
quite boring.
   ``We're pretty well stuck up here with no driver, no truck, no
nothing,'' said Moore. ``It can be very boring. ... after a while
when there's no radio communications, it can get slow, really
slow.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane warnings went up Friday from Cameron, La., to
Pensacola, Fla., as Tropical Storm Florence developed into a
hurricane and churned its way northward toward the central Gulf
Coast.
   Florence was expected to reach the coast of southeast Louisiana
sometime Friday night. It was 150 miles south of New Orleans and
moving north at 15 mph.
   There were also tropical storm warnings for winds greater than
50 mph from Pensacola to Apalachicola, Fla.
   Rain from Florence was spreading across southeast Louisiana and
along the Alabama coast.
   Thunderstorms along a stationary front along the coast of the
Carolinas and Georgia dumped heavy amounts of rain. Local street
flooding was reported in various areas of the South Carolina coast
and at Charleston, S.C.
   Rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included over
2 inches at Tyndall Air Force Base in Panama City, Fla.; 2 inches
at Charleston, S.C.; over 1}-inches at Beaufort, S.C. Marine Corps
Air Station; and over 1 inch at Tallahassee, Fla.
   Temperatures Friday afternoon were in the 60s along the Pacific
Coast, over the northern Rockies, from northern Montana across
North Dakota into northern portions of the upper Great Lakes
states. Temperatures were in the 60s due to clouds and rain from
northwest Florida into western portions of the Carolinas. Readings
were in the 90s over southwest Texas, north-central Texas, and over
the desert Southwest. The rest of the nation had temperatures in
the 70s and 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 106 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   The low in the nation Friday was 24 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Saturday's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Virginia and the southern Atlantic Coast states across Florida and
Alabama into Louisiana. Thunderstorms were expected over southeast
Louisiana and southern Mississippi from Florence. Widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms were expected in the northern Rocky
Mountain states.
   High temperatures were to be in the 60s over northern portions
of the upper Great Lakes and along coastal sections of the Pacific
Northwest. Highs were to be in the 90s over the Florida peninsula,
the southern and central Plains, the central and southern Rockies,
the southern Plateau region and the inland valleys of California.
Temperatures were expected to be between 100 and 105 in the desert
Southwest. The rest of the nation were to have highs in the 70s and
80s.

<HEAD>Government Announces $557 Million S&L Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal savings institution regulators on
Friday announced another in a series of large rescue packages,
providing $557 million in aid to a Michigan home-building company
to acquire four insolvent Texas savings and loans.
   Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp., which insures deposits in the nation's 3,000
S&Ls, will provide $312 million in promissory notes and $245
million in additional cash assistance and guarantees over the next
10 years.
   Pulte Diversified Companies Inc., the acquiring company, is
putting up $45 million for an 80 percent stake in the four thrift
associations, all in the Houston area, and for a fifth institution
which was not identified.
   Wall said the details on acquisition of the fifth institution
would be released in a few days. He said several technical, but not
serious, snags had developed in wrapping up the deal.
   Pulte is investing $22 million for the four associations named
Friday and $23 million for the fifth.
   Officials declined to say how much government assistance would
be injected into the fifth institution, but bank board member Roger
Martin noted that the transactions were ``parallel,'' possibly
indicating that as much as another $500 million would be required.
   Pulte, based in Bloomfield, Mich., a Detroit suburb, is a group
of companies with $3 billion in assets. It has homebuilding,
mortgage financing and home insurance operations in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland,
Michigan, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia.
   This transaction represents its first venture into the savings
industry.
   Wall said Pulte's new S&Ls will be permitted to lend to and make
investments in the projects of other Pulte subsidiaries.
   Stuart Root, FSLIC director, said interaffiliate transactions
would be strictly controlled and monitored quarterly by regulators.
   Many thrift institutions in Texas got into trouble in the first
place through real estate construction and development loans and by
directly investing in those projects. Real estate values in the
region were dependent on the health of the once-booming but now
moribund oil industry.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said he was not familiar with the details of the Pulte
arrangement but that he is very concerned in general about real
estate and other speculative investments by savings institutions.
   ``I'm very concerned about having institutions that have 85
percent of their liabilities insured by the federal government get
involved in any kind of speculative activity. That's a serious
mistake and you're bound to have real problems in a recession,'' he
said in an interview.
   Wall said Pulte is an example of the bank board's efforts to
bring outside investors into the Texas savings industry, adding,
``Other investors like Pulte, who are waiting in the wings, will
help us fulfill the strategy of consolidation we adopted to restore
the Texas thrift industry to health.''
   The bank board has now resolved the cases of 35 of Texas' 124
insolvent institutions. Nationally, it has resolved 102 cases this
year, compared with 48 last year.
   In just the last four weeks, S&L regulators have pledged nearly
$13 billion to rescue more than 50 institutions. Regulators are
rushing to complete many deals before the start of the new fiscal
year on Oct. 1 so that they will not count against the 1989 budget
deficit. Wall said he hopes to finish 65 rescues during September.
   The four institutions being acquired by Pulte are the Heights
Savings Association, Houston; Allenpark Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Houston; Bay City Federal Savings and Loan
Association, Bay City, and Gulf Coast Savings and Loan Association,
Richmond. Combined, the S&Ls have 25 branches.
   Wall said the insurance fund, which gets its money from an
assessment on the industry, could recover some of its $557 million
contribution by eventually selling its 20 percent stake in the new
Pulte-owned institution. FSLIC will also share in the new
institution's profits and reap 25 percent of the tax benefits of
the deal.

<TEXT>
   If would-be Miss Americas use tape or
surgery to improve their figures, that's OK, pageant judges say, as
long as the contestants also show they're modern, articulate women.
   The pageant's six preliminary-rounds judges agreed Friday that
they have no qualms about figure-enhancing techniques.
   Such techniques, often questioned during this
scholarship-awarding pageant, have been a consistent topic of
discussion in the first days of the 1988 competition here this week.
   A new Miss America will be picked on Saturday by a panel of
celebrity judges. They'll choose from among 10 semi-finalists
picked this week by the preliminary judges.
   The preliminary judges say they wouldn't be put off if some
contestants used unnatural gimmicks.
   Those techniques _ long discussed on the pageant circuit _
include surgical breast implants, adhesive-taped chests, and a
sticky spray used to make swimsuits cling.
   ``Does it really matter if her breasts are taped?'' asked judge
Trudy Haynes, an entertainment reporter on Philadelphia television.
   ``It's their choice,'' added William Goldman, a screenwriter
whose credits include ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''
   According to the judges, figure enhancing is fine, so as long as
it's done with overall appearance in mind and not specifically to
win the Miss America title.
   Such techniques aren't against pageant rules. Even if they were,
the judges say they probably wouldn't know which contestants were
using the gimmicks.
   Cosmetic surgery ``is a product of the '80's,'' said judge Mary
Jennings, an opera soprano and former third runner-up in the
pageant.
   Miss Mississippi Carla Haag, who won a preliminary swimsuit
event Thursday, also endorsed the use of artificial techniques to
make bodies look better. She declined to say whether she had had
cosmetic surgery.
   Miss Haag said surgery could be considered if it helped make a
woman ``a much better person and to feel better about yourself.''
   The judges said they support retaining the swimsuit event,
despite continung criticism that it undermines the pageant's
credibility as a scholarship competition.
   The event, where competitors must walk the 200-foot-long runway
clad only in a taut suit and high-heeled shoes, is designed to
gauge physical fitness and poise, pageant officials say.
   Pageant executive director Leonard Horn has said he will
consider replacing the swimsuits with another measure of fitness.
   But Miss America insiders believe the swimsuits help draw the
annual television audience so important to the pageant's financial
success.
   Judges said the fitness and poise evidenced in the event help
indicate how able a Miss America a young woman might be.
   As important is a contestant's showing in the talent event, and
in a seven-minute interview with the judges behind closed doors.
   ``She probably won't have to put a swimming suit on with high
heels again. But she's got to be able to put a noun and verb
together,'' said judge Rick Lester, managing director of the San
Antonio (Texas) Symphony Orchestra.

   Federal money cannot be used to construct
roads for a shopping center being built adjacent to a historic
Civil War battlefield, lawmakers agreed Friday.
   Members of a House and Senate conference committee adopted a
measure introduced by Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., that prohibits
federal funds from being used for the planning, design, or approval
of an interchange near the proposed William Center development,
about 27 miles west of the nation's capital.
   The conference committee is seeking to reconcile House and
Senate versions of a $10.8 billion transportation appropriations
bill.
   The measure, which was included the appropriations bill, will
expire in two years, but Mrazek said it could be renewed if a
dispute between the shopping center developer and preservationists
is not resolved by then.
   ``The result today makes it manifestly clear that the Congress
does not want to assist in the development of this land,'' said
Mrazek, who predicted that a ``substantial amount'' of the
development tract would ultimately be saved.
   The 542-acre development is adjacent to the Manassas National
Battlefield Park, site of two crucial Civil War battles.
   Historians argue that the project, which would include a 1.2
million square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of
office space and 560 homes, would destroy the rustic sanctity of
the 4,200-acre park.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., is preparing legislation that would
seize a section of the site and direct the developer, John T.
Hazel, to eliminate the shopping mall from his plans and greatly
reduce the amount of office space.
   Warner's plan would add to the park a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops during the
Second Battle of Manassas. Historians and preservationists argue
that this parcel is the most significant in the entire development
tract.
   Transporation officials have estimated that the interchange
would cost up to $50 million.

   A judge said Friday he won't follow federal
sentencing guidelines to calculate prison terms for two men
convicted of the same drug offense because the defendants would
receive vastly different sentences.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson made the ruling in
the case of two men who pleaded guilty to selling a vial of
``crack'' to an undercover police officer for $25.
   Under the guidelines, one defendant would receive a prison term
of 12 to 18 months while the other would be sentenced to 17{ to 21
years for the same offense, Jackson said.
   ``The presentence reports reveal that both defendants are in
their early 30s. They have similar prior criminal records and
similar personal histories, and they are, for practical purposes,
on the basis of information presently known, indistinguishable as
co-participants in a routine small-quantity drug sale such as occur
daily in distressing numbers,'' Jackson said.
   Jackson said the disparity in the two sentences under the
guidelines ``derives primarily'' from ``evidence identifying only
McDuffie'' with possession of drugs found in a nearby car.
   The judge said he would not apply the guidelines when the two
defendants appear to be sentenced on Sept. 14.
   The guidelines, which were established by a commission set up
under the 1984 Sentencing Reform Act, provide an elaborate formula
for calculating prison terms according to a defendant's criminal
history and the severity of his offense.
   The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments Oct. 5 on the
constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines, which provide for
prison terms without parole.
   Federal judges began sentencing prisoners under the guidelines
late last year. Since then, 142 federal district judges have
declared them unconstitutional while another 104 have upheld their
constitutionality, according to figures compiled by the U.S.
Sentencing Commission.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also voted 2-1 to strike
them down.
   In the case before Jackson, Gary D. McDuffie and Aubrey F.
Martin pleaded guilty to distribution of a controlled substance
after they were arrested April 16 after selling a vial of ``crack''
to an undercover officer.
   Officers who searched a nearby automobile, which was registered
to McDuffie's girlfriend, found personal papers bearing McDuffie's
name, a .38-caliber revolver and 109 grams of ``crack.''
   McDuffie also pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm in
connection with narcotics trafficking _ for which he will receive a
mandatory five-year prison term that must be served after he
completes the prison term for the drug conviction.
   Another difference, the judge noted, was that McDuffie was still
on parole for a seven- to 21-year sentence at the time of his
arrest. Martin received three year's probation in 1978 instead of a
five- to 15-year prison sentence for a felony conviction that was
suspended.

<HEAD>Report tentative agreement to end postal strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Post Office and striking union
members reached a tentative agreement Friday to end a 9-day-old
national strike by 90,000 workers, postal officials reported.
   But after a day of talks Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the
Union of Communication Workers, said ``a number of points'' needed
clarification and union leaders would meet with their negotiators
Monday to reconsider the agreement.
   ``There can be no misunderstandings between the Post Office and
ourselves,'' Tuffin said.
   Bill Cockburn, managing director of the Post Office, approved
the pact earlier Friday, according to a spokesman who was not
identified in line with Post Office rules. ``The document calls for
ending the strike as soon as possible,'' he said.
   The tentative agreement schedules further talks on the central
strike issue of bonuses for new employees in London and southeast
England, where the cost of living is higher than in the rest of
Britain.
   The union, which represents most of the service's 180,000
workers, wants the bonuses paid throughout Britain.
   More than 100 million pieces of mail remain unsorted by the
90,000 sorters and deliverers who walked out in a 24-hour work
stoppage Aug. 31. The strike continued after Post Office officials
hired temporary workers.
   Counter workers who belong to the same union but have not been
involved in the bonus dispute said Friday they had taken a strike
vote over a different issue but their mail ballots became lost in
the backlog of unsorted letters.
   The union's 22,000 counter workers voted whether to strike over
the Post Office plan to close 750 branch offices or convert them
into private suboffices, said a union official.
   The official said the results of the strike vote were to have
been announced early next week but had been postponed.
   A Post Office spokeswoman said half of the country's 1,500
sorting offices were shut and the Belfast office was the only one
of 82 main sorting offices open.

   Israeli troops arrested
225 Palestinian activists in the occupied lands Friday during a
crackdown that smashed a Gaza Strip network accused of organizing
subversion.
   Fights broke out between Islamic fundamentalists and supporters
of PLO chief Yasser Arafat throughout the West Bank and Gaza, where
the fundamentalists mounted a strike to challenge the pro-PLO
uprising leadership.
   The strike called by Hamas, which means zeal, shut down
businesses and transportation in most of the occupied lands and
stopped workers from going to jobs in Israel.
   The fundamentalists oppose any negotiated settlement with Israel
while some supporters of the Palestine Liberation Organizxation
have been urging peace talks.
   Police said an Arab who allegedly collaborated with Israel was
assassinated in Jaffa. Twelve Palestinians, including two 14
year-olds and a 13-year-old, were reported wounded in clashes with
troops in Gaza City and the West Bank city of Nablus.
   Since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied territories 260
Palestinians have been killed, most by Israeli gunfire. Five
Israelis also have been slain.
   Using a new tactic, hundreds of soldiers surrounded the West
Bank village of Kfar Malik, 15 miles north of Jerusalem, at dawn
Friday and arrested 25 Palestinians accused of anti-Israeli
activities, Arab witnesses said.
   A crackdown in Gaza broke up a clandestine ring of 200
Palestinian members of 37 committees responsible for organizing
anti-Israeli activity in communities throughout the coastal strip,
the army said.
   It said the suspects were linked to Arafat's Fatah faction of
the PLO.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, Gaza Strip commander, said the
detainees were accused of taking part in 45 arson and firebomb
attacks on Arab shopowners who failed to heed strike calls and on
alleged collaborators.
   Mordechai said the Gaza leader of the PLO network was among
those captured but he declined to identify him.
   Israeli television identified the suspect as Abdallah Abu
Samhadaneh and Arab sources said he was a Gaza City resident who
has spent 10 years in Israeli prisons.
   The televlision report said other detainees included Aata Abu
Kirsh, an engineer it said was a senior Fatah executive in Gaza;
Mohammed Saadi, head of Gaza City's popular committees, and Ayish
Abu Saada, a teacher who led the communist committees.
   Mordechai said the sweep was ``certainly a decisive blow to the
committees in Gaza and to their activity in the field. This does
not say there will be no other committees but their influence will
not be the same.''
   He said he would recommend expulsion for some of the detainees.
Israel has deported 33 Palestinians since the uprising began
despite international protests.
   Israel radio said three members of the Gaza ring were suspected
of killing Rachel Weiss, an elderly woman found near her Negev
desert collective farm on Aug. 3.
   In Kfar Malik, Ibrahim Saleh, 25, a farmer whose 21-year-old
brother Jamal was arrested Friday, said many village youths managed
to elude troops and escape into the foot hills after town gards
whistled the alarm about 3 a.m.
   ``A lot of people managed to get away because they heard the
whistling,'' Saleh said.
   Villagers said troops backed by helicopters searched
house-to-house for Palestinians included on a 50-name list took the
suspects away handcuffed and blindfolded in jeeps.
   ``The soldiers broke into the houses and smashed windows. They
also threw tear gas into the houses,'' said Baher Mohammed, 32, who
pointed to a ground floor room still thick with gas.
   Islamic fundamentalists and rival PLO supporters fought each
other with stones, knives and fists in a number of areas, including
the West Bank's Al Amari refugee camp and Bethlehem, Arab witnesses
said.
   They said the fighting in Bethlehem broke out after masked
youths loyal to the fundamentalists rode bicycles through the town
warning shopkeepers to close their businesses or face reprisals.
   ``Anyone who doesn't close his shop will find it burned
tonight,'' said one youth who wore a black garbage bag over his
head.
   At least one Hamas supporter was injured in Bethlehem when
pro-PLO youths loyal shoved him onto a burning tire, the witnesses
said.
   Also Friday, the army announced it would free 150 Arabs being
held without trial in a Negev desert prison camp at Ketziot. It
said the releases were a humanitarian gesture for the Jewish New
Year that begins Monday.
   On the political front Foreign Minister Shimon Peres sent a
letter to Washington accepting an invitation to talks Sept. 26 on
the Middle East peace process.
   The invitation brought charges from members of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's conservative Likud bloc that Peres, leader of the
liberal Labor Party, engineered the invitation to advance his
candidacy in Israel's Nov. 1 parliamentary election.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Forest Fire Assistance Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed legislation Friday
designed to pave the way for Canadian assistance in fighting the
rash of forest fires in Western states, promising ``every action
possible'' to minimize the damage.
   Meanwhile, a Cabinet-level team named by the president will fly
west Saturday and visit Yellowstone National Park, the Cody, Wyo.,
area and Boise, Idaho, to assess the situation and formulate
recommendations on more federal assistance in firefighting.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Agriculture
Secretary Richard Lyng and Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft
IV would fly from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., and be joined in
Denver by Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, who was in Dallas on
other business.
   Fitzwater said they would go first to West Yellowstone, Mont.,
for a briefing by the Yellowstone Area Command, then to the Old
Faithful Geyser area and on to Cody before flying to Boise for a
tour of the Interagency Fire Center there. They will return to
Washington on Sunday.
   The legislation signed by the president authorizes mutual
agreements with foreign fire organizations for wildlife protection.
   ``This allows us to bring in needed equipment and personnel from
our Canadian neighbors to help combat these wildfires,'' Reagan
said.
   The legislation was passed on Thursday.
   ``I applaud the leadership and members of both the House and
Senate for their rapid passage of this emergency legislation,'' the
president said. ``I will take every action possible to control the
remaining fires and prepare for the fires that may yet come.''

   Here are some comments Thursday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   DAN QUAYLE, pelted with questions about a story published in
Friday's (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reporting that Quayle got into
the University of Indiana Law School on an affirmative action
program for the poor and minorities: ``I got into law school fair
and square. No rules were broken.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, reacting to Dukakis' statement Thursday that the
Democratic nominee would consider deploying Star Wars if research
shows it works and if it is in the interest of national security:
``Calling it a fantasy one day, something he won't rule out the
next ... suggests a confusion in my view on the basic facts.
Confusion in terms of what he really believes and where he would
take this country.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, in a stinging rebuttal to Bush's recent attacks
on him:
   ``Just as (the Republicans) did to Franklin Roosevelt and
(former U.S. House Speaker) Sam Rayburn, they're now attacking my
patriotism. And just as they did in the 1930s and the 1950s, the
American people can smell the garbage.''
   
   LLOYD BENTSEN, speaking to hundreds of farmers in Iowa: ``It's
time for a change from the policies and personalities that
devastated our farms, punished our farmers and left rural America
in the dust.''

   An Iranian man poured gasoline over his
head Friday and set himself afire outside U.N. headquarters, and
Iranian dissidents said it was to protest executions of government
opponents in his homeland.
   The man, Mehrdad Imen, 32, a registered alien living in Los
Angeles, was taken to the burn center at New York University
Hospital where he was listed in critical condition with burns over
his entire body.
   The immolation took place about noon outside the United Nations
building at 42nd Street and First Avenue as other Iranians
protested in a nearby park, police said.
   ``He considered it the best way to draw attention to the recent
wave of executions in Iran,'' said Mohammad Sedaghat, a spokesman
for People's Mujahedeen, the Iranian opposition group that
organized the park rally.
   Ten pint-sized plastic bottles that had contained gasoline
remained on the sidewalk by evening, along with ashes, a
half-burned blue shirt with white stripes, a charred suitcase and
the remnants of a Manhattan bus map showing the route to the United
Nations.
   Imen was known in the Iranian community as an activist against
the government ruled by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Imen flew to
New York on Friday with other Iranians from Los Angeles who joined
the organized protest at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza at 47th Street,
said Sedaghat.
   On the flight to New York, Imen told fellow Iranians of his
outrage over the executions and his intention to carry out a
personal protest, but did not reveal his plans, Sedaghat reported.
   Rally organizers said 1,200 people attended the Friday protest,
but journalists on the scene estimated up to 500 people were in the
crowd.
   Twenty years ago, a Buddhist monk set himself on fire just
outside the U.N. gates but survived, said U.N. spokeswoman Nadia
Yousef. At the time, monks in South Vietnam were immolating
themselves to protest corruption in President Nguyen Van Thieu's
government.
   The People's Mujahedeen, a group of Iranian exiles dedicated to
overthrowing the Khomeini government, claims that nearly 1,210
dissidents have been executed in Iran since midsummer.
   The group said in a statement that Tehran is trying to crush
resistance because of Iran's acceptance of the cease-fire in its
8-year-old war with Iraq. The People's Mujahedeen (holy warriors)
says the truce demonstrates to the Iranian people that Iran's
religious rulers pursued a lost cause in the war.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, appealed to its members on Sept. 2 to pressure Iran
to halt the executions.
   Amnesty said most victims belonged to the People's Mujahedeen
but about 20 supporters of other opposition groups were also
reported to have been executed.
   It did not estimate the number of people killed but said a ban
on family visits to political prisoners in Evin Prison in Tehran,
the Iranian capital, ``fueled speculation that hundreds of
political prisoners have been executed.''
   Amnesty noted that Iranian official news media said 15 People's
Mujahedeen members were executed Aug. 5.
   The People's Mujahedeen has a military wing, the National
Liberation Army, which conducted raids on July 25-28 in which it
claimed to have captured the cities of Kerend and Islamabad in Iran
and to have inflicted 50,000 casualties on Iranian troops.
   Most of the executions followed the raids.
   The People's Mujahedeen asked Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to investigate. No U.N. mission could enter Iran without
being invited, however.

   Three more West Germans _ two men
and a five-year-old girl _ have died of burns suffered in the
Ramstein air show disaster, bringing the death toll to 59, state
officials reported Friday.
   In the federal capital of Bonn, air force Maj. Gen.
Klaus-Wilhelm Rimmek resigned. He had been criticized for allowing
an officers' party to be held hours after the tragedy on Aug. 28.
   More than 200 people were injured at the air show at the U.S.
Air Force base at Ramstein when three planes in an Italian air
force stunt team collided and one crashed in flames into the crowd.
   Rimmek, the first person to quit as a result of the tragedy,
acknowledged he allowed the ``Fliers' Ball'' to go on as scheduled
in Noervenich, near Cologne, even though he was informed earlier of
the Ramstein catastrophe.
   ``Sure, they had a moment of silence at 10 p.m., but then the
swinging and swaying just kept right on going,'' said Alfred
Biehle, a member of a parliamentary committee investigating the
crash. Biehle is a member of the Christian Social Union party of
Bavaria.
   Juergen Dietzen, a spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate state
where the Ramstein base is located, said the state has started
making emergency payments to help victims and survivors.
   He gave no amount, but said the state made the first payments
from federal funds to aid the victims and the federal government
would provide further compensation for personal injuries and
property damage.
   Dietzen told The Associated Press, ``Three more people have
died'' and said two were West German men in their 40s and a girl.
He gave no details.
   Dietzen said 157 people were still hospitalized Friday, with 25
to 30 in critical condition ``and some of them are in danger of
dying.''
   Officials gave this breakdown by nationality of the dead: 52
West Germans, a U.S. soldier and her nine-year-old son, one French
citizen, a Dutch citizen and the three Italian pilots.
   More than 300,000 people were attending the air show.
   Federal lawmakers in Bonn have begun an investigation.
   Erwin Horn, a defense spokesman for the opposition Social
Democrats, said he doubted Christian Democratic Defense Minister
Rupert Scholz had adequately carried out his ``supervisory duties.''

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
inspected the bombed headquarters of the South African Council of
Churches on Friday, then prayed for those who planted the
explosives.
   Police later surrounded and entered the nearby Central Methodist
Church, where the black prelate gave a news conference and tried to
hold a private meeting with members of the church council staff.
   ``The only surprising thing is it took so long,'' Tutu said of
the bombing while a security police video team filmed him.
   An explosion before dawn Aug. 31 heavily damaged Khotso House,
where the council and several other anti-apartheid groups have
their offices. More than 20 people in the area suffered slight
injuries and the building was declared unsafe for further use.
   The council moved into Khotso House during Tutu's tenure as
general secretary 1978-1984. Tutu won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
for his work against South Africa's apartheid policy of racial
discrimination and now heads the Anglican church in southern Africa.
   ``Foul, foul foul!'' Tutu muttered, bending under crumpled
doorways and crunching shattered glass beneath his feet during a
tour of three of the building's six floors.
   Tutu and the church council's current general secretary, the
Rev. Frank Chikane, entered through a balcony from a temporary
metal staircase over the wrecked main entrance.
   They went to each floor via the back fire escape because the
building's staircases were impassable. Walls were knocked down,
glass was broken and doors were blown out in every room.
   Surveying the elevator shaft, which apparently took the brunt of
the explosion, Tutu said: ``It was done by an expert.''
   He stepped on a small table as he entered his old office and it
collapsed, then a partition fell over next to him. ``I left this
office in better shape,'' he told Chikane.
   At the news conference, Tutu said ``the forces of darkness''
were behind the bombing and declared that ``the government, and its
supporters have tried before to destroy'' the council.
   When asked who he held was responsible, Tutu said: ``Sometimes I
amaze myself at how diplomatic I can be. But people who are wise,
like yourselves, know exactly who we mean.''
   Police have not reported significant progress in their
investigation. Anti-apartheid activists believe the attackers were
right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force unit.
   If the police make arrests in the case ``I will give them a
prize,'' Tutu said.
   Police allowed a crowd of blacks to sing and dance in the street
outside Khotso House for nearly an hour. Riot police moved in as
Tutu came out to deliver his prayer for the bombers but took no
action.
   Soon afterward, however, officers scuffled with a guard at the
door of the Methodist Church conference hall when he tried to keep
them out of the meeting.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Workers staged a general strike
in Argentina Friday and dozens of people were reported hurt in
Buenos Aires as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to scatter
thousands of demonstrators.
   The independent news agency Diarios y Noticias said four people
were seriously injured when a rally in the broad Plaza de Mayo
outside Government House turned into a street brawl, including
fights between members of rival unions. It said 23 policemen were
hurt and 60 demonstratorsprotesters were treated for injuries at
the scene.
   The strike was organized by the country's largest labor
federation to protest Argentina's deteriorating economy and the
policies of President Raul Alfonsin.
   ``This is a referendum of the people against the hunger and
misery the government is trying to impose on us!,''
Secretary-General Saul Ubaldini of the General Labor Confederation
told the Plaza de Mayo rally.
   ``Every day there's less work and my family can't live on what I
earn,'' said Daniel Rio, a truck driver who attended the rally.
``That's why I'm here.''
   The strike was called for noon to 8 p.m. so people would show up
for work and then take part in rallies and demonstrations.
   Striking signalmen shut down commuter trains before dawn,
however, and many bus drivers took a long midday break. Some
businesses closed early, particularly the expensive shops on
Florida Street, a pedestrian mall near the Plaza de Mayo.
   Strikes shut down or interrupted business in Cordoba, San Miguel
de Tucuman, Rio Negro, Santa Fe and other cities.
   The rally in this capital city began peacefully, with unions and
political parties waving banners and chanting slogans to the beat
of rubber hoses on bass drums.
   Demonstrators from rival unions began quarreling and then
fighting and police fired tear gas and rubber bullets. At one point
club-swinging police waded into the crowd.
   Ubaldini, rubbing his eyes smarting from tear gas, pleaded from
the stage for order as police trucks with water cannon scattered
the remaining crowd. Some protesters broke store windows as they
left.
   Argentina is suffering inflation in which prices increased 53
percent in the past two months. Unemployment and underemployment
are near 14-year highs. Real personal income has declined for three
straight years, the government acknowleges.
   Five weeks ago Alfonsin implemented his third major
anti-inflation plan in five years. It included devaluation of the
austral, Argentina's currency; the lifting of restrictions on some
imports, and voluntary controls on wages and prices.
   In addition to reducing inflation, the goal was to secure new
loans from the International Monetary Fund and commercial banks to
help repay interest on Argentina's $56 billion foreign debt.
   The General Labor Confederation and member unions complained
that prices were rising despite the controls and pressed for higher
wages. The federation, to which virtually every union belongs, also
demanded that Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille resign.
   ``I want the government out of the International Monetary
Fund,'' said Oscar Zanetich, a 41-year-old public school teacher
when questioned on the street by a reporter. He also complained
about teachers' salaries.
   Argentina's debt, the third-highest in the developing world, and
the billions of dollars it pays every year in interest are
criticized by leftists, unions and the opposition Peronist Party.
   ``I repudiate the economic policies of the government,'' said
23-year-old history student Faviana as she spray-painted ``People
Power'' on the wall of a building outside the plaza. She would not
give her last name.
   The strike was the 12th staged by the labor federation since
Alfonsin took office in December 1983, ending years of military
rule.
   Supporters of Alfonsin's centrist Radical Civic Union said the
strike was meant to undermine the anti-inflation plan and to unite
support for Peronist presidential candidate Carlos Menem in
national elections set for next May.
   One component of Alfonsin's general economic plan is the
privatization of some of the dozens of state companies, including
the telephone company, the national air carrier Aerolineas
Argentinas and the national shipping line.
   Unions representing workers at the companies generally oppose
privatization, fearing that jobs would be cut. The Peronist Party,
closely tied to the unions, has raised obstacles in Congress to the
sale of state-owned companies.

   Yugoslavia will host the 1989 summit of
nations professing non-alignment and become the first country to
serve a second term as the movement's chairman, sources at a
ministerial meeting said Friday.
   The late President Josip Broz of Yugoslavia helped found the
movement and his communist nation was host of the 1961 summit. The
host nation becomes chairman for the ensuing three years.
   Foreign ministers of member nations and organizations produced
resolutions Friday on major issues, including Afghanistan,
Palestine and the Iran-Iraq war. Political and economic committees
also worked on resolutions to be presented to the final plenary
session Saturday.
   Yugoslavia did not announce acceptance of the foreign ministers'
request that it host the summit and become chairman of the
101-member group. Tanjug, the official Yugoslav news agency, said
the country's collective presidency decided to submit the proposal
to the parliament.
   The 95 delegations at the Nicosia conference had deadlocked on
the
   chairmanship in a contest also involving Nicaragua, Indonesia
and Cyprus.

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
said Friday the government may have lost up to $5 million on the
sale of a building in California and he demanded an investigation.
   In a speech to the Senate, Enrile claimed the government
violated laws that require government property be sold by public
bidding.
   President Corazon Aquino said in a statement the $10 million
price for the building, which housed offices of Philippine
Airlines, was ``deemed the best practicably obtainable in the
circumstances because of building restrictions in San Francisco.''
She did not elaborate.
   The building was sold in April 1986, two months after Mrs.
Aquino assumed office after a civilian-military uprising drove
President Ferdinand Marcos into exile.
   A week ago, Enrile accused relatives of Mrs. Aquino of the
``systematic looting'' of state-run companies. The president and
her family denied the charges and challenged Enrile to present
proof.
   Senate President Jovito Salonga and Sen. Rene Saguisag, both
members of Mrs. Aquino's Cabinet when the building was sold, said
they would welcome an investigation.
   Enrile presented documents at a news conference after his speech
that he said showed Mrs. Aquino and the board of the Government
Service Insurance System, owner of the building, gave official
approval four months after the sale.
   ``I am not enjoying this work because I have to assault the
sensibilities of my fellow human beings,'' Enrile said. ``The fact
is this property was sold hastily at a loss, almost
surreptitiously.''
   The documents showed the building on the corner of Stockton and
Geary streets was purchased in 1982 for $10 million, the same price
for which it was sold four years later. Enrile said it should have
brought $12-$15 million.
   One of the documents Enrile presented quoted Feliciano Belmont,
manager of the government insurance system, as telling Mrs. Aquino
irregularities may have been involved in the 1982 purchase by the
Marcos administration because the building was worth only $6-$8
million.
   In defending the sale, Saguisag said, ``There was an urgent need
to sell the property to cut losses.'' He did not elaborate.
   Tourism Secretary Jose Antonio Gonzalez, who also was involved
in the sale, told reporters the sale was necessary even at a loss
because the building was heavily mortgaged and the government could
not afford the payments.

   Two gunmen disguised as mailmen
boarded a train outside Belfast on Friday and killed a commuter,
the second Protestant activist slain this week, police and
witnesses said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility, according to
news reports, which did not specify how the claim was made.
   Police said 30-year-old Colin Abernathy was shot once in the
head as the train drew into a suburban station at Finaghy, four
miles southwest of Belfast, during the morning rush hour.
   Witnesses told police the assailants boarded the train a few
stops earlier and sat across from their victim before shooting him.
   The attackers fled to a waiting car, which later was found
abandoned in Andersonstown in mainly Catholic west Belfast, a
police spokesman said.
   The train, coming to Belfast from Coleraine in the north,
proceeded to the next station, near City Hospital. Abernathy was
pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital, the spokesman said.
   Abernathy, a clerk with the Northern Ireland Electricity Board,
was a district treasurer in the Ulster Clubs. The Protestant
protest group was organized to resist the 1985 Anglo-Irish
agreement, which gives the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in
the province.
   On Wednesday, gunmen killed Billy Quee, 32, a leading member of
the Ulster Defense Association, an umbrella organization of
Protestant vigilante groups formed in the 1970s.
   The Irish People's Liberation Organization, a shadowy extremist
group, claimed responsibility.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the British province's police
force, said it expected IRA violence to intensify before the end of
the year and urged citizens to be on guard.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the
Republic of Ireland, which is 95 percent Roman Catholic.
   The IRA recently stepped up its campaign against security
forces, using large quantities of Czechoslovak-made Semtex
explosive that police believe reached the IRA through Libya.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said in a statement Friday, ``All
the information in the possession of the police indicates that the
threat from the Provisional IRA is escalating and their intention
is an horrific remainder to 1988.''
   Sgt. James Green of the constabulary said that police on Friday
arrested several people after finding one pound of Semtex and 200
pounds of fertilizer during searches in west Belfast. Those
arrested were not identified.
   Bomb-makers extract the nitrates from fertilizer to make
explosives, Green said.
   Police said they suspected the IRA was responsible for a bomb
that exploded in a parked van Thursday night outside a police
station in Coagh, County Tyrone, injuring five police and nine
civilians.

   Leaders of the campaigns of George Bush and

second debate between the Republican and Democratic presidential
nominees, Dukakis' campaign chairman Paul Brountas said Friday.
   Previously, they settled on having the first presidential debate
in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Sept. 25, and to follow with a second
one elsewhere on either Oct. 13 or Oct. 14, depending on the length
of the American League baseball playoff series which will be

   Brountas said he talked with Bush campaign chairman James Baker
by phone Friday and they reached an agreement on having the second
debate in Los Angeles.
   Both debates are expected to be general in subject matter.

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan
Quayle said Friday he got into law school ``fair and square'' and
not through an affirmative action program designed to help
minorities.
   Reacting to a published report, Quayle's wife, who also attended
the Indiana University School of Law, said the special orientation
program Quayle participated in was unrelated to any affirmative
action plan.
   A law school official said affirmative action for blacks or
other minorities ``was not a strong consideration at that time.''
   The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported earlier Friday that the
admissions program Quayle went through in 1970 was intended to
offer equal opportunity to minority group members, the economically
disadvantaged and other ``students of different viewpoints and
backgrounds.''
   The newspaper quoted Cleon H. Foust, dean of the law school when
Quayle entered, as saying ``I can only remember blacks'' as the aim
of the program.
   ``The program sort of made up for their background,'' he said.
``The suggestion was that many had not had the scholastic
background to cut the mustard in graduate school.''
   Foust declined comment when contacted by The Associated Press on
Friday.
   Law school officials and Marilyn Quayle said Friday the program
was designed to help any aspirants whose college grades and
entrance exam scores weren't good enough to ensure admission but
who had other credentials that indicated they might succeed in law
school.
   As he left Canton, Ohio, Quayle told reporters, ``I got into law
school fair and square. No rules were broken.''
   Asked if he had enrolled in a special program, he said he had
taken a summer course. ``It was just a class that was recommended
to me by the dean.''
   He refused to speak about the Plain Dealer story, saying, ``I'm
going to talk about the issues that the American people are
interested in, not some story.''
   G. Kent Frandsen, who was in charge of admissions when Quayle
applied in 1970, said ``there were probably less than three
minorities'' among about 30 students admitted into the school
during the program's two years.
   He said law schools traditionally had little data other than
college grade-point averages and law school admission tests to use
as criteria for admissions. In the late 1960s, the university's law
school faculty authorized faculty member Charles Kelso to conduct a
program by which he would review other information.
   Among such information, Frandsen recalled, were a student's
undergraduate major, courses taken, the school attended and letters
of recommendation.
   ``Affirmative action was not a strong consideration at that
time,'' Frandsen said.
   Larrie Wilkins, associate dean for academic affairs at the
school, was quoted by the Plain Dealer as saying, ``The affirmative
action element is implicit if not explicit'' in documents
describing the program, ``but since affirmative action was not the
exclusive aim, we would not expect all participants in this program
to have been minority candidates.''
   Mrs. Quayle said the pre-entrance program wasn't an affirmative
action program.
   ``It was this special admissions program for any student who the
dean and professors thought could make it through law school and
would be a good attorney,'' she said while campaigning in
Indianapolis.
   ``Dan Quayle made it through law school, did a good job, passed
the bar exam on the first time, which a number of people who have
run for president have not done,'' Mrs. Quayle said.
   The law school in Indianapolis directed all inquiries Friday to
the university's news bureau, where the staff said law school
officials were trying to put together an accurate portrait of the
pre-entrance program.
   ``The information about it is sketchy,'' said Charlotte Wright,
an editor at the news bureau. She said the program ``certainly
wasn't called'' an affirmative action program.
   Meanwhile in Washington, 12 House Democrats held a news
conference to accuse Quayle of hypocrisy for using the special
program and then voting in Congress against education programs such
as teacher training, Head Start and aid for disadvantaged students..
   ``It seems to me Dan Quayle owes an explanation about how he got
into law school ... and took advantage of a program clearly
designed to help minorities and the disadvantaged,'' said Rep.
Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
   The Democrats called on the university to release records
surrounding Quayle's admission to its law school, and they asked
Quayle to release copies of his academic records.
   The university has said it will not release Quayle's record
until he grants permission.

   Republican George Bush said Friday his
opposition to abortion should not be ``a litmus test that everybody
has to agree with.''
   Bush reiterated that he opposes abortion except in cases of
rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered. He said
many of his key supporters disagree with him on the subject while
there are ``a lot that agree with me.''
   Commenting on numerous subjects at the beginning of a campaign
swing through Illinois and Pennsylvania, Bush also:
   _Said the government should re-examine its policy of letting
wilderness fires burn.
   _Tried to distance himself from a man fired from a campaign
advisory committee after complaints about anti-Semitism.
   _Ridiculed Democratic rival Michael Dukakis' recent statements
on the Strategic Defense Initiative, accusing him of contradictions
and confusion.
   With more than 1 million acres charred at Yellowstone National
Park, Bush said, ``I think we ought to take another look at the
policy. ... Nobody can argue this is the best way to do it.''
   He commented briefly on the anti-Semitism issue one day after
his campaign fired a member of a Bush committee after disclosure
that the man had defended Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who was
convicted in Israel as a Nazi war criminal.
   ``He wasn't on my staff,'' Bush said of Jerome Brentar,
cochairman of the Bush '88 Coalition of American Nationalities.
``It was an advisory committee. The list came over from the
Republican National Committee.''
   Bush said, ``I just don't want people associated with me who
have a record of bigotry of any kind, racial bigotry. religious
bigotry, whatever it is.''
   ``I don't know this person, but if that's the record, why we're
better not to have any question raised of that nature and have the
person do something else.''
   Bush made his comments in an interview in Rockford, Ill., before
flying to Pekin, near Peoria, where he attended a courthouse rally
and was applauded by a large crowd.
   Bush later closed his campaign week with a rally before a
cheering, flag-waving crowd of thousands in York, Pa. ``I
understand that today the liberal governor of Massachusetts
attacked me for questioning the patriotism, his patriotism. I'm not
questioning his patriotism,'' Bush said. ``I'm questioning his
judgment,'' he added.
   Dukakis had compared Bush's attacks on him to Joseph McCarthy's
accusations in the 1950s. Dukakis said of Bush: ``I don't question
his patriotism, but I do question his judgment.'' The Democratic
nominee said Republicans were returning to tactics of the 1930s and
1950s in ``attacking my patriotism (but) the American people can
smell the garbage.''
   Earlier, in Illinois, at one point after Bush spelled out his
position on abortion, a reporter noted that Rep. Lynn Martin,
R-Ill., the co-chairman of his campaign who joined him in Rockford,
is pro-choice on the subject.
   ``I have a lot of key supporters who agree with Lynn and a lot
that agree with me,'' Bush said.
   Saying he was proud to have her in a leadership role, Bush said,
``Who's going to have a litmus test that everybody has to agree
with everybody on every single issue?''
   When it was noted that the GOP platform takes a hardline stand
against abortion, Bush said, ``The platform states the position of
the platform but nobody in our party takes a litmus test that says
that everybody has to agree on every issue. I expect the Democrats
could say the same thing.''
   On other points:
   _Bush refused to comment on a report that his running mate, Dan
Quayle, a wealthy Indiana senator, got into Indiana University Law
School on an affirmative action program for the poor and
minorities. ``I never comment on rumors and thank God I didn't when
they were all flying around back there (at the Republican
convention) about my running mate and everyone now sees that they
were grossly unfair. So I don't.''
   _He said he has not decided how much the minimum wage should be
increased. Bush, who has long opposed any increase, is expected to
announce a change in position soon. ``Well, I'm talking to some of
our experts and I'm going to do what's fair. I'll tell you one
thing, though, I will insist that there be a minimum wage
differential.'' He did not elaborate.
   In a speech in Rockford, Bush accused Dukakis of changing his
position on the Star Wars missile-defense program.
   Dukakis said Thursday he would consider deploying Star Wars if
research showed that it worked and was essential to the national
interest. A day earlier, Dukakis, a frequent critic of the program,
had called it a ``fantasy in the sky.''
   Bush, who supports the program, said, ``Calling it a fantasy one
day, something he won't rule out the next ... suggests a confusion
in my view on the basic facts. Confusion in terms of what he really
believes and where he would take this country.''
   Bush spoke before the Illinois Federation of Republican Women in
Rockford before flying to Peoria for the rally at the Tazewell
County Courthouse in Pekin and then on to Pennsylvania.
   Illinois and Pennsyvlania are key states in the presidential
race, commanding a total of 49 electoral votes. The race is close
in both states, with Dukakis believed to have an edge in
Pennsylvania.
   Bush's campaign had considered a stop at Peoria's Caterpillar
plant, but after the hostile reaction he got from a union audience
in Portland, Ore., earlier in the week, decided on going to Pekin.
   Addressing the GOP women's group, Bush hinted at a new proposal
that could help close the ``gender gap'' in support among women for
his campaign.
   Departing from his text, Bush said, ``Look, we also need to
assure that women don't have to worry about getting their jobs back
after having a child or caring for a child during a serious
illness.'' He did not spell out what he had in mind.
   Bush devoted a good chunk of his speech to chiding Dukakis for
seeming to soften his position on Star Wars, which is formally
known as the Strategic Defense Intiative, and on modernization of
strategic weapons.
   ``Does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or
doesn't he?'' Bush asked.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis endorsed ``full
statehood'' for the District of Columbia on Friday and won a strong
statement of support from former rival Jesse Jackson in an
appearance before a black religious group.
   ``Accept my recommendation,'' Jackson said of Dukakis. ``He can
be trusted to help keep hope alive.''
   Both appeared before the Baptist National Convention USA, the
largest black religious denomination with 8 million members. The
group is politically active, and most in attendance stood up to
demonstrate their endorsement of the Democratic presidential
nominee following the speech.
   Dukakis and Jackson also met privately for about 15 minutes
before addressing the group.
   ``In just 60 days, we can elect a president who will strengthen
our voting rights laws, not undermine them,'' Dukakis said, ``who
will fight for the universal voter registration bill now before the
Congress, and who will stand by the people of the District of
Columbia in their struggle for full statehood and equal rights.''
   Statehood for the District of Columbia would give Washington,
D.C., voting representation in the House of Representatives plus
two members of the Senate. It is an issue Jackson has pressed
Dukakis to highlight.
   Jackson delivered a stirring endorsement of Dukakis and blasted
Republican George Bush as insensitive to the needs of the poor and
minorities.
   ``Bush sees America from the penthouse down. Somebody must be
concerned about the basement, the foundation, where the common
people live,'' Jackson said.
   ``Why do I support Michael Dukakis? Why do I ask you to go and
support him with fervor? Because Bush does not care and (GOP
running mate Dan) Quayle does not understand. Dukakis cares and
understands,'' Jackson said.
   Dukakis won one of his warmest receptions of the campaign from
the predominantly black audience. He repeatedly reminded the crowd
that the election was in 60 days and, in spontaneous responses, the
audience _ comprised largely of black ministers _ responded with
loud shouts of ``Just 60 days.''
   The president of the group, Rev. T.J. Jemison, endorsed Dukakis
and asked those in the audience who would agree to back Dukakis to
stand up. Nearly everyone in the crowd of 1,000 people stood up.

   A surprise rail strike in New York City's northern suburbs
forced 95,000 commuters to find another way to get to work Friday.
In Chicago, a railroad strike disrupted rush-hour evening service
despite a bill signed by President Reagan to impose a settlement.
   The New York area employees returned to work under court order
hours after the strike began, and officials said train service was
near-normal during the evening rush hour. Legislation to force the
Chicago workers to do the same thing passed in Congress on Friday
afternoon, but it was too late to get commuter trains rolling on
time from Chicago.
   The strike by 780 track workers in New York's Metro-North
Commuter Railroad was prompted by the suspension of 37 employees
Tuesday for refusing to work overtime, the Teamsters said. The
union contends that forcing tired workers to continue on the job
could be dangerous.
   Other unions quickly honored the Teamsters' picket lines,
shutting down the line and catching morning commuters in
Connecticut and New York northern suburbs without warning.
   ``The train problem today is a surprise to me,'' said Jim Grant
at the South Norwalk, Conn., train station. ``I wasn't even
listening to radio or TV.'' He said he would drive to a town that
has bus service to New York.
   Friday evening, Metro-North operated about a third fewer trains
out of Grand Central Terminal because much of the commuter line's
equipment was left at the northern part of the system by the
strike, said spokesman Dan Brucker.
   In Chicago, 2,600 United Transportation Union workers struck the
Chicago & North Western railway at 9 a.m. CDT when the railroad's
parent company began posting layoff notices eliminating 1,150
brakemen's jobs.
   The strike could have begun just after midnight, when a
federally mandated cooling-off period expired. But the company and
union had agreed to hold off the actions until after the heaviest
part of the morning rush hour.
   The delay assured some 41,000 commuters in the north,
northwestern and western suburbs a ride to work, but many commuters
sought alternate methods of getting to work and ridership was down
about 40 percent.
   ``This is terrible. I think it very unfair and just, plain
stupid,'' said Marge Miller of Chicago. ``You just can't believe
something like this can happen.''
   A bill imposing a compromise settlement in the dispute was
approved by the Senate on Thursday. The bill, which would trim the
number of brakemen's jobs by 689, then passed the House on Friday
afternoon. Reagan signed the bill early Friday evening.
   The first train pulled out of the company's downtown terminal
after 5 p.m. CDT. But railroad spokeswoman Robin Bourne-Caris said
the company was having difficulty finding full work crews, adding
to the delays.
   ``Some of the union people left today and not all have come back
even though many of the pickets are down,'' she said.
   ``Most of our people were docked pay'' during a brief strike on
Aug. 4, the day the cooling-off period was imposed, said David
Wells, a brakeman. ``We informed our commuters that we didn't
anticipate there would be an evening rush hour.''
   In New York, the strike was halted after U.S. District Judge
Inzer Wyatt ordered the Teamsters back to work.
   ``We are going back because we felt we got the point across,''
said John Mahoney, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 808. ``We
had the attention. There's a lot of people involved, a lot of
politicians involved now. ... The commuters are screaming.''
   The judge set a hearing Monday afternoon on whether to issue a
permanent injunction and whether to award damages. The railroad,
contending the strike was illegal, sought $1 million in damages and
also vowed disciplinary action against the strikers.
   The House vote imposing the settlement in Chicago almost did not
take place Friday.
   Under House rules, members must unanimously agree before a bill
can be brought to the floor without a waiting period. One Chicago
congressman with close ties to labor briefly blocked that quick
action, raising fears that the Chicago-area strike could have
dragged on until at least Wednesday. But he later withdrew his
objection.
   Congress and the president have authority under the Railway
Labor Act to to settle railroad disputes that threaten national
commerce.
   The dispute stems from the railroad's effort to reduce the size
of freight crews by eliminating two brakemen per train, saying
those jobs are obsolete. The union contends that to eliminate those
workers would compromise safety.
   The strike also halted C&NW's 10-state freight operation, but
the company was prepared to resume those runs with management
personnel, said C&NW spokeswoman Leslie Cleveland.

   Evacuees who fled Hurricane Florence sat
around tables at the high school refugee center Friday night,
eating gumbo and talking about the storms they have known.
   ``It seems like you have to leave every time you turn around,''
said Joe Gonzales, 66, of Delacroix Island. ``We're evacuees.''
   ``It's aggravating,'' said Lazarus Gonzales, 48, a distant
relative who also lives at Delacroix Island.
   ``You know you're leaving home and you might not have a home to
come back to,'' said Joe Gonzales.
   So why not move away?
   ``Where we live is God's Little Acre,'' said Joe's wife Ruth,
65. ``It's the best place to live even though every time a storm
comes through, we've got to go.
   ``If our home's destroyed, we'll make another government loan
and build again.''
   Lazarus Gonzales added, ``When I leave there, it'll be in a
box.''
   They were among about 100 people who found refuge at the St.
Bernard High School cafeteria. Most were families, wise in the way
of hurricane survival. They had their blankets. Some brought TVs.
The Red Cross furnished plastic lounge chairs for makeshift beds.
   Dolores Lucas, 50, of Poydras, brought her sheet, blanket,
pillow and medicine.
   ``And I had to make sure I had my soft drinks and enough
cigarettes,'' she said.
   Lorance Evans, 61, also of Poydras, warned: ``Always fear a
storm. Don't try to be superman and fight it.''
   Lucas and Evans are brother and sister and came together. They
brought enough to stay two days.
   ``I've been through this so many times, I know I better come to
the shelter,'' Evans said.

   Michael Dukakis compared George Bush's
attacks on him Friday to Joseph McCarthy's accusations in the 1950s
and said of his Republican rival, ``I don't question his
patriotism, but I do question his judgment.''
   He said the Republicans were returning to tactics of the 1930s
and 1950s in ``attacking my patriotism (but) the American people
can smell the garbage.''
   In Dallas later, where Dukakis endorsed making the District of
Columbia a state, the Democratic nominee gained a strong statement
of support from former rival Jesse Jackson. Appearing, as Dukakis
did, before a black religious group, Jackson said of the
Massachusetts governor: ``Accept my recommendation. He can be
trusted to help keep hope alive.''
   Bush, asked by reporters on a campaign stop in Illinois if he
were indeed questioning Dukakis' patriotism, responded, ``I'm not
saying that. ... I'm just questioning his judgment on the issues
the American people are interested in.''
   Later, at a rally in York, Pa., before a flag-waving crowd, Bush
responded to Dukakis' remarks, saying: ``I understand that today
the liberal governor of Massachusetts attacked me for questioning
the patriotism, his patriotism. I'm not questioning his
patriotism.'' Then the vice president added: ``I'm questioning his
judgment.'' The crowd of thousands roared its approval.
   In Washington, Bush campaign aide Mark Goodin accused Dukakis of
``strident name-calling'' and said, ``The American people are
getting a good look at the real Michael Dukakis and his views and
they simply don't like what they see.''
   Bush, in criticizing Dukakis on national defense and other
issues in recent days, has used the phrase about not questioning an
opponent's patriotism but questioning his judgment.
   The Democratic presidential nominee, campaigning in Bush's
adopted home state, delivered a stinging assault _ his strongest
yet in an effort to put his campaign back on the offensive at a
time when he is slipping in the polls.
   Dukakis referred to recent news accounts that top advisers to
the Bush campaign represented a Bahamian official under
investigation for involvement with drugs and said: ``I don't
question Mr. Bush's patriotism, but I do question his judgment.''
   He repeated the sentence over and over as he cited Bush's role
in the Iran-Contra affair, alleged corruption in the Reagan
administration and other charges.
   ``Today, here in Texas and in nearly 30 states throughout the
country, we're giving George Bush 60 days notice _ 60 days notice
that we're going to beat him on election day,'' Dukakis said.
   The speech was still being written as Dukakis flew to Texas from
New York, and campaign chairman Paul Brountas said much of the
rewriting was done by Dukakis himself.
   He spoke to an estimated 5,000 people at East Texas State
University, a site that was selected because it was the alma mater
of the late U.S. House Speaker Sam Rayburn, a revered figure in the
east Texas area that is considered a key battleground in the
Dukakis-Bush race.
   Dukakis said that when Rayburn led legislative reforms of Wall
Street and public utilities in the 1930s, ``Republicans put
together the biggest and most vicious campaign'' against him.
   ``They attacked Sam Rayburn and Franklin Roosevelt, and they
called them communists,'' Dukakis said. Rayburn, he said, replied,
``I'm a conservative, but even a conservative can smell garbage in
his front yard.''
   ``Sam Rayburn knew that when you fight for the real people, the
other side will attack your patriotism,'' Dukakis said. ``He saw it
again in the 1950s when the Republicans cheered as Joseph McCarthy
slandered good Democrats as communists.'
   ``And those Republican tactics haven't chagned,'' Dukakis said.
``Just as they did to Franklin Roosevelt and Sam Rayburn, they're
now attacking my patriotism. And just as they did in the 1930s and
the 1950s, the American people can smell the garbage.''
   Dukakis spoke of his support for a new federal law, opposed by
Bush and running mate Dan Quayle, that requires employers to give
60 days notice to employees before factories are closed.
   The Dukakis campaign began airing commercials in Texas this week
hammering at the Republicans on that plant closing bill.
   The campaign was holding rallies around the country noting that
there are now about 60 days to election day. They were circulating
pink handbills _ ``pink slips'' _ that said Bush would be put out
of work.
   Dukakis later went to Dallas where, speaking to the National
Baptist Convention U.S.A., a large, predominantly black religious
group, he endorsed the idea of statehood for Washington, D.C. He
also met privately with Jackson for about 15 minutes before
addressing the group.
   ``In just 60 days, we can elect a president who will strengthen
our voting rights laws, not undermine them; who will fight for the
universal voter registration bill now before the Congress, and who
will stand by the people of District of Columbia in their struggle
for full statehood and equal rights,'' Dukakis said.
   The candidate canceled plans to then fly to New Orleans for a
rally and fund-raiser. Campaign trip director Jack Weeks said the
threat posed by hurricane Florence was the reason.
   Brountas said Dukakis' tough new attack on Bush followed ``a
number of events that have occurred.'' He referred to reports that
people with anti-Semitic views were given posts in the Bush
campaign and that a firm with ties to Bush campaign manager Lee
Atwater received $800,000 for lobbying on behalf of the Bahamian
prime minister who is under a drug investigation.
   ``This is the issue of leadership, leadership differentiated by
judgment, and he's talking to the vice president's judgment,''
Brountas said.
   Dukakis flew to nearby Greenville, Texas, where he was greeted
outside the airport by school children and a high school marching
band. Dukakis stopped his motorcade in front of the band, which was
playing a Republican theme, ``God Bless the U.S.A.'' He borrowed a
trumpet and played ``Happy Days Are Here Again,'' a Democratic
standard.
   Dukakis, citing, Bush campaign officials' ties to the firm that
lobbied for the Bahamian official, said, ``These advisers, or their
representatives, had over a dozen meetings with the vice
president's staff, and used their personal relationships throughout
the government to help their client.''
   He blasted Bush's ``silence as dozens of administration
officials were indicted and convicted or forced to leave public
service.''
   ``Republicans have been trying to cut Social Security and
Medicare for eight years. Until yesterday, they had opposed every
effort to increase the minimum wage,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I don't question their patriotism. I do question their
judgment _ and their lack of concern for real people.''
   Dukakis' speech was interrupted momentarily when supporters
began chanting to drown out the heckles of a small group of
protesters. Some of the protesters carried anti-abortion signs, a
familiar scene at Dukakis rallies. Others carried signs that read
``Go Home Yankee.''

   Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd
Bentsen told farmers on Friday that his party would reverse
Republican trade and market policies that have ``punished our
farmers'' in the past eight years.
   Bentsen, speaking to hundreds of farmers and their families
sitting on hay bales at the World Ag Expo, said, ``235,000 farmers
have been ... driven off the land while George Bush has been vice
president.''
   ``It's time for a change from the policies and personalities
that devastated our farms, punished our farmers and left rural
America in the dust,'' he said.
   The Democrats, he said, would pursue an aggressive trade policy
that Bush and the Republicans have fought, and work to research new
uses for agricultural products to expand farm product demand.
   ``I've worked around farmers all my life, and the farmers I know
would much rather be making their money from the market place''
than from the government though subsidies, he said.
   Bush and Sen. Dan Quayle, his running mate, are not what farmers
want, Bentsen said.
   Republican Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., ``hit the nail on the head
when he said Bush doesn't know what's going on'' when it comes to
agriculture, Bentsen said.
   He continued, saying he was still quoting Dole, ``Agriculture is
not his strong suit. I don't know what it is, but it's not
agriculture.''
   As for Quayle, Bentsen noted that the Indiana senator passed up
an invitation to speak at the huge agriculture exposition. Farmers,
Bentsen said, ``just might ask him about agricultural policy and if
you did, he just might not have an answer.''
   The Texas senator was making his first trip to Iowa since
receiving his nomination.
   A poll in June by the Des Moines Register showed Dukakis with a
60 percent to 28 percent lead over Bush in the state. However, a
new poll released by the newspaper last weekend showed the edge had
shrunk to just 47 to 42.
   Bentsen, who was raised on a south Texas ranch, joined in the
spirit of the agricultural fair by mounting a big green John Deere
tractor with an eight-bottom plow and driving it for about 20 feet.
A highlight of the expo is a furrow-digging contest.
   Afterward, Bentsen met with reporters and said he was confident
Dukakis now knows more about Midwest agriculture since he made
controversial remarks in the primaries about how farmers should
start looking into Belgian endives.
   ``I'm sure he does,'' Bentsen said.
   Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, told reporters the big early lead in
the polls for Dukakis was inaccurate, based on ``soft'' voter
opinions. The latest poll was probably more accurate, he said.
``Having a Democrat lead in Iowa is an unusual event,'' he said.
   Bentsen then went to California to take part in the Democrats'
day of giving the Republicans 60 days' notice of getting voted out
of office, a play on the plant closing bill that President Reagan,
Bush and Quayle fought before Reagan allowed it to become law.
   At a rally in a union hall in Bloomington, Calif., Bentsen told
a cheering crowd that ``we're here today to give the Republicans a
better break than they give the American worker.''
   ``Sure, we could provide notice the Republican way,'' he said.
``We could go there election eve and change the locks on the door.
   ``We could take the vice president's White House mess card and
cancel that. And we could take away Air Force II,'' he said. ``But
we agree with the vast majority of the American people who say 60
days' notice is fair.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters and
equipment were redistributed Friday to prepare for wind gusts up to
60 mph, while fires kept two small towns evacuated and the oldest
national park mostly closed to visitors.
   Saturday ``may be the worst day since this entire episode
began,'' U.S. Forest Service official Brian H. Avery said Friday.
``We're trying to prepare for that today, because tomorrow will be
too late to prepare for it.''
   Elsewhere, a firefighter battling a blaze that doubled overnight
to 27,500 acres in Glacier National Park and adjacent forest in
northwestern Montana was killed by a falling, burning tree,
becoming the first death directly attributable to this year's
forest fires.
   That blaze destroyed 15 homes and dozens of outbuildings and
burned structures at two ranger stations, a bridge and several
historic cabins.
   Last month, a helicopter involved in battling a blaze in
Wyoming's Bighorn National Forest crashed after losing power,
killing a passenger, a Bureau of Land Management technician.
   Meteorologists had been predicting that an advancing weather
front would produce extremely high winds during the weekend in
Yellowstone but might also bring some rain or snow by Monday.
   A revised forecast Friday no longer anticipated any rain or
snow, Avery said at a briefing on fire conditions.
   ``We see no direct relief in site and we are anticipating major
fire activity,'' Avery said, adding that ``probably in excess of
150,000 acres'' could be burned by wind-whipped flames.
   Emphasis shifted from the Old Faithful complex, which should be
``in reasonably good condition'' because Wednesday's firestorm
burned an area around the perimeter that should provide a buffer
against any further major burning there, Avery said.
   The Clover Mist fire ``is our No. 1 priority currently,'' Avery
said. By Friday it had burned more than 263,000 acres in the
northeast quadrant of the park and the adjacent Shoshone National
Forest.
   ``We're looking at (fire danger to) a lot of structures in the
Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone River and also in Sunlight Basin,
Sunlight Creek,'' he said. ``Many ranches and a few lodges down
there are going to need some additional protective measures.''
   The sparsely populated Sunlight Basin in the national forest was
evacuated Friday afternoon as flames threatened ranches.
   Thirteen fires burned almost 1.2 million acres as of Friday in
the Greater Yellowstone area, and 11.5 million acres of national
parks and forests in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. In 2.2
million-acre Yellowstone itself, 816,225 acres have burned.
   Fires also burned Friday in Alaska, California, Colorado, Idaho,
Utah and Washington.
   So far this year, 68,396 fires in the West have burned 3,799,550
acres, including just over 2 million acres in Alaska, in what
federal officials have called the worst fire season in 30 years. At
the same time last year, 49,492 fires charred 1,272,412 acres,
according to the Boise Interagency Fire Center, which coordinates
the fighting of forest fires in the West.
   The fire center has said said more than 25,000 firefighters were
at work, but spokesman Arnold Hartigan said Friday that number
could easily stretch to 30,000 with military and support personnel.
   Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng, Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel and Undersecretary of Defense William Howard Taft IV were to
arrive in Yellowstone on Saturday to inspect conditions.
   Lyng, Hodell and Taft are to visit Old Faithful geyser, where a
firestorm Wednesday destroyed 17 buildings, and fly over the towns
of Cooke City and Silver Gate, Mont., at the northeast corner of
the park.
   In Washington, D.C., President Reagan signed legislation Friday
designed to pave the way for Canadian assistance in fighting the
fires. The measure, passed by Congress on Thursday, authorizes
mutual agreements with foreign fire organizations for wildlife
protection.
   Residents of Cooke City and Silver Gate, who were among 150
people evacuated Tuesday, were allowed back in for a short time
Thursday but were told to leave again Thursday night because of the
danger of the approaching 151,000-acre Storm Creek-Hellroaring fire.
   ``We're back into another critical situation,'' fire information
officer Bob McHugh said Friday.
   The drain of battling the fire began to take its toll on
firefighters, said Nick Tafoya, another information officer. ``A
lot of crews are quitting because they're tired, fatigued,'' he
said, but had no figures on how many crew members were affected.
   Yellowstone's north and west entrances were open Friday, but the
only attraction at the west gate was fishing on the Madison River,
said park spokeswoman Robbie Brockwehl.
   Officials closed the last open lodging facility in the park for
the season Friday, the Mammoth Hot Springs Inn, as the 222,000-acre
North Fork fire moved to within three miles.
   Elsewhere, Forest Service prepared a weekend assault on an
eastern Utah blaze that had blackened 12,000 acres of Ashley
National Forest and destroyed five homes and cabins. An estimated
50 families had evacuated, officials said.
   Oregon's Department of Forestry barred the public from nearly 1
million acres of forest because of extreme fire danger, bringing to
9.5 million acres the amount of state, private and federal land
closed in Oregon. Last year, 10.3 million acres were closed.
   Near Entiat, Wash., the state's biggest forest fire jumped a
road that firefighters had hoped would stop it, destroying a barn
and forcing the evacuation of three families. The Dinkleman Fire,
which grew by 3,000 acres to 40,000 acres, already had destroyed
critical winter range for mule deer and bighorn sheep, officials
said.
   In Idaho, officials closed part of the Salmon National Forest
due to a 30,000-acre fire. Gov. Cecil Andrus said that if matters
worsen, a full-scale closure could be ordered.

<TEXT>
   Some of the world's leading
Nazi hunters predicted many war criminals would die unpunished and
said the United States was not aggressive enough in tracking down
former Nazis.
   ``We must do all that is possible so that we don't give Adolf
Hitler a posthumous victory,'' said Neal Sher, director of the U.S.
Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations.
   Sher was among dozens of war crimes investigators attending a
conference marking the 30th anniversary of West Germany's Central
Office for the Investigation of Nazi War Crimes.
   Others at the meeting, held in 18th century Ludwigsburg Palace,
included renowned Nazi expert Simon Wiesenthal and Shmuel
Krakowski, director of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Archives in
Jerusalem.
   Sher rejected any suggestions that investigators should end
their work just because many of the more notorious Nazis who
participated in large-scale massacres have been convicted, are dead
or have disappeared.
   ``Sometimes I hear that only the small fry are left,'' he told
The Associated Press before addressing the conference, ``but for
each of the victims there was a family that suffered. And if the
family members weren't themselves killed, they were emotionaly
scarred.''
   Sher said the United States did not do enough to find Nazi
criminals in the first decade after the war.
   ``I believe that the United States dropped the ball in not
pursuing as vigorously as we should have war criminals in the
United States,'' he said.
   One example he gave was Klaus Barbie, the ``Butcher of Lyon''
who succeeded in entering the United States after the war and is
now in a French prison.
   ``Tragically, for every visa that was granted to a persecutor, a
legitimate refugee was denied an opportunity to come to the United
States,'' Sher said.
   Wiesenthal told the AP: ``There were such big possibilities
after the war. The ones who have escaped _ they are a special
chapter, the lost possibilities.''
   Of the remaining war criminals, he said: ``They are getting old.
This is my daily problem. We have cases we can never bring to
court. They may die, but they won't die innocent,'' Wiesenthal said.
   In his speech to the conference, Sher said: ``We have to accept
the fact that vast numbers of those involved in crimes of
persecution will never be brought to justice in any form.''
   He said Nazi leaders' policies of killing witnesses and
destroying documents has hindered investigators and survivors of
the atrocities are dying from old age.
   ``The efficiency of the Third Reich's genocidal policies made it
a virtual certainty that many would go to their graves never having
been called to account for their pasts,'' Sher said.
   A Czech speaker, Karel Kamis, earlier accused West Germany of
not doing enough to prosecute Czech cases in the 1960s and 70s.
   Kamis, an official with Czechoslovakia's Commission for the
Investigation of Nazi Crimes, said that during those years his
country turned over 89 reports on suspected war criminals who were
living in West Germany.
   ``But not one of those cases resulted in prosecution,'' Kamis
said. ``The testimony of witnesses from Czechoslovakia was not
believed.''
   He said cooperation between the two countries in Nazi
investigations has improved in recent years.

<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister U Nu, Burma's last
elected leader before the military ousted him 26 years ago, defied
the country's authoritarian rulers Friday and announced the
formation of a rival government.
   About 500 soldiers mutinied and joined the massive movement for
an interim government and full democracy in the first major
defection of troops to the opposition.
   More than 200 dependents from several diplomatic missions,
including 46 Americans, left Burma as a precautionary move, leaving
about 400 others still to be evacuated.
   In a letter to embassies, U Nu called for general elections Oct.
9. He announced a 26-member Cabinet with himself as prim minister,
former President Mahn Win Maung as president and retired General
Tin Oo, a vocal critic of the current authoritarian regime, s
defense minister.
   Diplomats said U Nu's chances of success are difficult to
assess. His country remains on the brink of chaos and the powerful
military is still intact. Some opposition leaders criticized the
move.
   The move, which follows weeks of massive, occasionally bloody
turmoil in this isolated Southeast Asian nation, is considered high
treason under present Burmese law.
   But neither President Maung Maung's government nor the military
responded publicly to the act. Some of U Nu's fellow opposition
leaders said formation of a parallel government could cause
``disunity among the people.''
   ``I have taken back the power which General Ne Win has robbed
from me,'' the 82-year-old U Nu wrote. ``From this hour, sovereign
power no longer rests with General Ne Win. It has come back into my
hands, and I announce this fact with joy.''
   Ne Win led the 1962 coup that toppled U Nu. Ne Win resigned as
head of the ruling Burma Socialist Program Party in July, but many
analysts believe he still controls it.
   Today's announcement was not the first time U Nu has tried to
regain control of Burma. In the 1970s, he attempted to lead an
anti-Ne Win insurgency from bases along the Thai-Burmese border but
the plan failed.
   About 400 air force personnel and about 100 troops from the navy
and army marched in a student-led demonstration, calling on troops
inside City Hall to join them. But they received no response.
   Most of the deserters were enlisted men, but reporters saw
several lieutenants.
   Earlier Friday, about 200 air force men fled to the Rangoon
University campus, the headquarters for student revolt. It was the
first major military defection to demonstrators seeking to topple
the authoritarian system.
   The soldiers shouted: ``We side with democracy and not with
fascists!'' and ``Our military training is not to shoot people!''
   Asked about the significance of U Nu's move, a Western diplomat
in Bangkok said: ``He's a good figurehead rather than a leader at
this point. It will depend on who his advisers are and also on the
attitude of the military.''
   ``His main value will be as a symbol,'' said another Western
diplomat. ``He seems to enjoy the support of the majority.''
   But key opposition leader Aung Gyi called U Nu's move
``preposterous'' and Aung San Suu Kyi, another major oppositionist,
told newsmen: ``I am only worried that such a move could cause
disunity among the people. If people support it, I will have to
support it.''
   Aung Gyi urged people to wait until Monday when a special party
congress decides on a referendum that could lead to democracy. ``It
doesn't pay to be rash at this delicate moment,'' he said.
   Protesters have demanded immediate formation of an interim
government to oversee a transition to democracy. They blame the
party's military autocracy for repression and economic policies
that transformed resource-rich Burma into one of the world's
poorest nations.
   ``Our country was ahead of Thailand before the army took over 26
years ago. We are about 50 years behind Thailand now,'' Aung Gyi
told a news conference Friday.
   Some analysts believe U Nu may be trying to take the initiative
from the Maung Maung government and entice the military to his
side. Others say the formation of a rival government could provoke
the military into a crackdown or coup.
   A special Thai Airways flight evacuated more than 230 dependents
and non-essential staffers from numerous embassies. Diplomats said
the evacuees included Americans, Australians, Filipinos,
Malaysians, Indonesians, British, Japanese, South Koreans, Soviets
and Thais.
   ``Foreigners are not in danger at present but life is very
difficult,'' said one World Bank official after arrival in Bangkok.
``There's no fuel and less and less food.''
   A Rangoon diplomat, speaking anonymously, noted supplies of
water and electricity also were becoming irregular.
   Students rioted in September 1987 to protest economic policies
and led broader-based street protests in March and June. Riots
flared anew after Ne Win resigned July 23 and the party chose
hard-liner Sein Lwin to succeed him.
   The government said 112 people died in Rangoon in rioting
against Sein Lwin, who resigned after 17 days as leader. Diplomats
believe many more people were killed.
   Maung Maung took power Aug. 19 as the country's first civilian
leader in 26 years. He lifted martial law in Rangoon and curfews
nationwide five days later, but protests continued.

   Opposition delegates made a last-ditch
attempt Friday to stall Chamber of Deputies confirmation of ruling
party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari as Mexico's next
president.
   Through weeks of stormy debate, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, known as the PRI for its initials in Spanish, has brushed
aside opposition claims that the election was rigged.
   An elderly opposition deputy, Alejandro Martinez Camberos of the
northern state of Durango, fell ill about 1:30 a.m. while waiting
for a chance to speak and was rushed to the hospital, according to
a spokesman for Martinez Camberos' Popular Socialist Party.
   The raucous debates reflect the largest opposition presence in
the legislature since the PRI was founded nearly 60 years ago. The
ruling party has a majority in the chamber, however, and the
opposition is diverse.
   ``If it's up to us, it (the confirmation) could last three days.
We plan to destroy their arguments one by one,'' Francisco Ortiz
Mendoza, a Popular Socialist spokesman, said shortly before the
session resumed Friday afternoon, several hours late. ``If they
allow an open debate, 200 speakers will go up to the podium.''
   His party belongs to the left-of-center Democratic Front
coalition headed by presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
leader of a democratic reform movement.
   Orlando Arvizu, a PRI deputy from Hidalgo state, told The
Associated Press Friday evening the chamber debate would continue
without further interruption ``until we certify the presidential
election.''
   Asked how long that could take, he noted the chamber had worked
24 hours straight to certify the results of the congressional
elections.
   Cardenas and the rightist opposition say the confirmation
session is the last chance for the PRI and the government it has
controlled since 1929 to set a fraud-tainted election right.
   Opposition delegates walked out on a key legislative committee
but failed to prevent the panel from recommending confirmation
early Friday.
   The PRI members of the committee declared the July 6 election
valid and said Salinas won with 50.74 percent, slightly more than
the 50.36 the PRI-dominated Federal Election Commission gave him a
week after the election.
   It said Cardenas received 31.06 percent and Manuel Clouthier of
the rightist National Action Party, or PAN, got 16.81 percent.
   The PRI and the government have consistently rejected opposition
charges.
   On Friday, the party accused the opposition of trying to derail
an orderly presidential transition. ``What they are seeking is to
destabilize the government and degrade the republic, its
institutions and its politics,'' a PRI statement said.
   The 500-member chamber has been sitting as an electoral college
since mid-August, certifying the results of the legislative races.
It began working on the presidential certification Friday.
   About 150 riot police looked on as several thousand opposition
supporters gathered outside the Legislative Palace on Friday,
yelling chants against fraud, as they have every day the chamber
has met.

   With contempt fines at $1 million a day and
massive layoffs a day away, the City Council scheduled an
eleventh-hour meeting Friday night for yet another vote on a
court-ordered desegregation plan.
   The Council, which has refused to implement the plan for
low-income housing, planned a meeting at 11:55 p.m., said Mayor
Nicholas Wasicsko. If the plan is approved, the city could avoid
the layoffs and the $1 million fine.
   A lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, Michael Sussman, said late Friday that the civil
rights group and the council had ``hammered out a fairly complex
agreement'' but the judge who imposed the potentially bankrupting
fines refused to consider the revised plan.
   ``He's not even going to listen to us,'' Sussman said of federal
District Judge Leonard Sand. ``I asked to present the proposal to
him and he didn't want to hear the details or the outline. He asked
only if the city was in compliance.''
   The city is being held in contempt of court for the City
Council's refusal, in a 4-3 vote, to carry out a housing
desegregation order.
   The biggest stumbling block remains the four recalcitrant
councilmen, Sussman said.
   ``Their position is they can't go in and vote on the ordinance
unless the changes we agreed to are made, and the judge just won't
give that agreement. His position is, you comply and after you
comply, you can come to me and I will consider your proposal,''
Sussman said.
   He would not disclose the proposed modifications.
   Changes in the plan also would have to be approved by the
Justice Department, which brought suit against the city with the
NAACP, and the department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Earlier, two of the defiant councilmen, spurning the chance to
change their stance on the issue, stayed away from a noon meeting
at which another vote on the plan was scheduled.
   But councilmen Peter Chema and Nicholas Longo showed up at City
Hall more than an hour later, with Longo confirming negotiations
were under way to end the segregation stalemate.
   ``We're only closer to the degree that there's communication
going on, and that's certainly a lot better than what was going on
a week ago, a month ago, a year ago,'' said Longo. ``They're not
hostile conversations.''
   Longo and Chema, along with councilmen Henry Spallone and Edward
Fagan Jr., have refused to accept a federally ordered housing plan.
   The entire council and Mayor Nicholas Wasicsko gathered Friday
afternoon and voted to transfer $819,200 to pay Thursday's fine.
   As the councilmen entered City Hall, some of the crowd outside _
angered by the report of negotiations _ shouted, ``Sellout!
Sellout!'' But another section applauded the vote to pay the fine.
   ``While I appreciate the sentiment of the cheers, there is
nothing to cheer about,'' the mayor said. ``We've just authorized
to pay fines in excess of $800,000. ... I sincerely hope this is
the last time we have to make such a transfer.''
   The fine payment came as support for opposition to Sand's plan
was starting to wane.
   ``We've done all we can. We went to the Supreme Court and didn't
get anywhere,'' said Henry Knetter, 65, a northeast Yonkers
resident. ``There's no garbage pickup. There might not be any
police protection. It may be time to wise up.''
   Knetter spoke for an increasing number of residents whose
opposition to low-income housing has softened as the realities of
Sand's fines began hitting home.
   Phone lines at City Hall were jammed this week with callers
urging one councilman to change his vote, Wasicsko said.
Uncollected garbage sits outside many homes; children going to
school have no crossing guards; the three town libraries close
Saturday.
   But at a contentious meeting Thursday, Fagan and other
councilmen criticized Sand, saying ``I hope there's a God up there
that will strike him down.''
   The fines, which began at $100 per day, doubling daily until
hitting a $1 million cap on Friday, forced the state Emergency
Financial Control Board to impose a ``Doomsday Plan'' aimed at
providing public safety services while delaying bankruptcy.
   Phase One starts Saturday, with 447 of the city's 1,834
employees receiving layoff notices as part of a $20 million savings
package. The Parks and Recreation Department will close; the
Panning Department will be slashed to two employees.
   Other layoffs will come from the departments of real estate,
civil service, fiscal services and public works. Control board
Chairwoman Gail Shaffer, New York's secretary of state, said the
cuts will keep Yonkers solvent until 1989.
   If the council refuses to back down, additional cuts are set for
Sept. 17 and 24, Oct. 8 and 22, and Nov. 5, Shaffer said.
   Sand, who in 1985 ruled the city had practiced segregation in
housing and education for 40 years, imposed the fines after the
four councilmen refused to implement part of his plan.
   City schools were desegregated under a plan approved by Sand,
and the City Council initially agreed to build 1,000 units of
low-income housing in January. But they rejected the housing plan
at an Aug. 1 meeting, prompting Sand to impose fines which would
double every day.
   The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Sand's fines on appeal, but placed
a $1 million cap on the daily amount.

   Despite continuing economic setbacks, African
governments are coping well with vital tasks of adjustment for the
future, the World Bank's vice president for Africa said Thursday.
   ``Those things which were manageable were being managed very
well by the Africans'' during the past year, Vice President Edward
V.K. Jaycox told reporters.
   Still, the general economic situation in Africa south of the
Sahara Desert continues to cause concern because the regional gross
product declined in 1987, a reversal of 1986 attributed mainly to
drought, he said.
   ``But recognizing that ``there is nothing we can do about
weather, war or terms of trade ... it was an extremely positive
year,'' Jaycox said.
   In the last two or three years about 30 governments have
undertaken structural economic adjustments and ``have seriously
come to grips with problems'' that were blocking economic growth,
he said.
   Jaycox, an American, was named to head the new World Bank
department for all African countries south of the Sahara formed in
the 1987 reorganization of the Washington-based lending
institution. The bank has been working with governments in the
region to reduce subsidies, promote realistic pricing and exchange
rates and encourage private initiative.
   Governments that once trumpeted support for a new world economic
order, ``rather than waiting for the day when somehow there is a
change in the economic order, are in fact coping'' with the
existing system and ``it's going to pay off,'' he said.
   With substantial reforms under way in half to two-thirds of the
countries south of the Sahara Desert, evidence is growing that
``sustained reforms do lead to improved economic performance and
growth,'' Jaycox said.
   He added that ``in contrast to generally shrinking world market
shares in the past, Africa actually increased its share of world
exports of some commodities in 1986-87.''
   The best real growth performances were registered by Ghana,
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Kenya, with 5 to 6 percent increases in
gross national product, Jaycox said.

   George Bush said Friday Michael Dukakis must explain how he
could say he would consider deployment of Star Wars after
denouncing the proposed missile defense system as ``a fantasy in
the sky.'' Dukakis called Bush's attacks on him McCarthyism and
said voters ``can smell the garbage.''
   Meanwhile, Bush's Republican running mate, Indiana Sen. Dan
Quayle, was peppered with new questions about his entry into law
school.
   Jesse Jackson, speaking to a black religious group in Dallas,
voiced strong support for Dukakis, saying that his former rival
``can be trusted to help keep hope alive'' and ``cares and
understands.'' Dukakis told the same group that he supports
statehood for the District of Columbia.
   Blasting Bush as insensitive to the needs of the poor and
minorities, as someone who ``sees America from the penthouse
down,'' Jackson said: ``Why do I support Michael Dukakis? Why do I
ask you to go and support him with fervor? Because Bush does not
care and Quayle does not understand. Dukakis cares and
understands.''
   Bush and Dukakis campaign leaders settled on Los Angeles as the
site of the second debate between the nominees, said Paul Brountas,
the Democrat's campaign chairman. Earlier, the leaders agreed the
first Bush-Dukakis debate will be in Winston-Salem, N.C., and
tentatively settled on Sept. 25 as the date for it.
   The Los Angeles round will be either Oct. 13 or Oct. 14,
depending on the length of the American League baseball playoff
series.
   Bush, speaking to GOP women in Rockford, Ill., said of Dukakis
and the Strategic Defense Initiative: ``Calling it a fantasy one
day, something he won't rule out the next ... suggests a confusion
in my view on the basic facts, a confusion in terms of what he
really believes and where he would take this country.''
   ``The governor's going to have to explain himself,'' he said.
   The Democratic nominee said this week he supports continued
research on a space-based missile defense system and would back
deployment if it were shown to be feasible and essential to the
national interest.
   Dukakis was campaigning in Texas after attending a $5 million
Democratic fund-raiser in New York at which he told the black-tie
audience, ``I won't kid you, this is not going to be an easy 60
days.''
   The Massachusetts governor was striving to regain momentum in
the face of recent polls that have said Bush had surged into the
lead in the presidential race.
   Speaking at East Texas State University, the alma mater of the
late House Speaker Sam Rayburn, Dukakis said that Republicans once
attacked Rayburn as a communist.
   ``Sam Rayburn knew that when you fight for the real people, the
other side will attack your patriotism,'' Dukakis said. ``He saw it
again in the 1950s when the Republicans cheered as Joseph McCarthy
slandered good Democrats as communists.
   ``And those Republican tactics haven't changed. Just as they did
to Franklin Roosevelt and Sam Rayburn, they're now attacking my
patriotism. And just as they did in the 1930s and the 1950s, the
American people can smell the garbage.''
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin responded, ``The American people are
getting a good look at the real Michael Dukakis and his views, and
they simply don't like what they see. We aren't questioning his
patriotism, we're questioning his judgment.''
   And, in Pennsylvania, Bush said it himself. Closing his campaign
week with a flag-waving rally in York, the vice president told the
crowd:
   ``I understand that today the liberal governor of Massachusetts
attacked me for questioning the patriotism, his patriotism. I'm not
questioning his patriotism. I'm questioning his judgment.''
   Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, campaigning
in Iowa, quoted Republican Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas as saying that
Bush ``doesn't know what's going on'' when it comes to agriculture.
   Dole, sharply critical of Bush when the two were competing for
the Republican presidential nomination, trounced the vice president
in the Iowa GOP caucuses last winter.
   Speaking at the World Ag Expo in Amana, Iowa, Bentsen said,
``It's time for a change from the policies and personalities that
devastated our farms, punished our farmers and left rural America
in the dust'' over the past eight years.
   Quayle went to a steel plant in Massillon, Ohio, where many
workers wore Dukakis-Bentsen T-shirts.
   ``I wasn't afraid to stand up for the steelworkers of Indiana or
the steelworkers of Ohio or the steelworkers of America,'' the
Indiana senator told workers at Mercury Stainless Inc. The Dukakis
supporters stood silent, while other workers applauded.
   At the factory gate, Qayle's car drove by about 150 protesters
who held up such signs as, ``Draft Dodger Quayle. Who Died in Your
Place?''
   Quayle also was confronted with questions about a Cleveland
Plain Dealer story saying that he was admitted to law school under
an experimental program designed primarily to benefit minority
students.
   ``The affirmative action element is implicit if not explicit''
in documents describing the program, said Larrie Wilkins, associate
dean for academic affairs of the Indiana University Law School.
``But since affirmative action was not the exclusive aim, we would
not expect all participants in this program to have been minority
candidates.''
   Quayle's staff released a statement saying, ``I got into law
school fair and square. Nothing improper was done and no rules were
broken. The newspaper article makes that point clear in the body of
the story.''
   ``I never comment on rumors,'' was Bush's response when asked
about the story.
   The vice president devoted most of his speech to the Republican
Federation of Women to attacking what he portrayed as a shift in
Dukakis' position on Star Wars _ officially known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   ``Does he believe in defense against strategic missiles or
doesn't he?'' asked Bush.
   ``I am committed to go forward fully with this research and then
to deploy when ready,'' he said. ``I do think that the governor's
going to have to explain himself on these contradictions and the
questions are going to be: How does he plan to defend America and
how can he pretend he wants to modernize when he has said he won't
modernize?''

<HEAD>GOP Leaders Say FY89 State Budget Could be $1.2 Billion Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican legislators said Thursday that the
state budget signed by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in July is out of
balance by as much as $1.2 billion because the Democratic
presidential candidate is overestimating tax collections and is
spending too much.
   ``The results are very sobering and very disquieting about the
future of this state,'' House Minority Leader Steven Pierce said.
   Senate Minority Leader David Locke joined Pierce in calling once
again on Dukakis to demand that the Legislature return to session
immediately to address the fiscal situation and other concerns.
   Noting that the House and Senate have been in recess since early
July and may remain on vacation until after the Nov. 8 election,
Locke denounced ``what has to be the longest vacation of any
legislative body in the history of mankind.''
   Although the Legislature voted for the current $11.6 billion
budget in July and Dukakis does not have the power to
single-handedly summon the Legislature back to work, the
Republicans laid both problems at Dukakis' feet.
   Dukakis has made the federal deficit a leading theme of his
presidential campaign.
   ``Based on our analysis, there is going to be a shortfall that
may exceed a billion dollars,'' Locke, R-Sherborn, said, adding
that the voters have a right to know whether Dukakis and Democratic
legislative leaders plan tax increases.
   Michael Lellyveld, spokesman for Finance Secretary Frank Keefe,
insisted that the budget was balanced. ``Their numbers don't add
up,'' Lellyveld said.
   The fiscal year, which began in July, is now two months old.
According to the Revenue Department, tax receipts in July dropped
15.6 percent from July 1987 and rose 2.8 percent in August compared
to the same month in 1987.
   According to the Republican analysis, the two-month average
increase of 1.4 percent is far below the traditional pace of
receipts in the first two months of the fiscal year. Indeed, based
on the traditional proportion of all taxes brought in during those
two months, the 12-month total could be off by more than $437
million.
   Moreover, the Republicans assert that the governor is depending
on ``ephemeral'' and ``flimsy'' projections of $245 million in
extra revenues this year, based on stepped-up enforcement by the
Revenue Department and the state auditor.

<HEAD>Humphrey Apologizes For Remark That Young Mother Shouldn't Run For
Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETSY HENDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican U.S. Sen. Gordon Humphrey on
Thursday retracted his remark that Betty Tamposi shouldn't run for
Congress because she has small children, calling the statement
``just plain stupid.''
   ``In plain English, I made a mistake, I am sorry, and I
apologize,'' Humphrey said in a statement.
   ``While everyone knows of the strains congressional families
experience as a result of the long working days of members of
Congress, I had no right to impugn the motives of any person
wishing to serve in Congress,'' he said.
   The controversy began Tuesday after a speech when Humphrey
suggested Tamposi was negligent to run for the U.S. House with two
daughters, ages 22 months and 4. Tamposi, a millionaire officer in
her father's real estate company, pays a nanny to care for her
children.
   ``It's self-evident that you cannot work 12 to 14 hours a day in
Congress and have time left over for a child,'' he said.
   ``It's difficult enough being a father of a young child and a
member of Congress, as I am,'' said Humphrey, who has a 3-year-old
son. ``For the mother, who in our society is the primary care
giver, working 10-12 hours a day makes it impossible to give the
nurturing the child would need.''
   The remarks drew criticism from Tamposi's campaign which
denounced them as irresponsible and insulting and demanded an
apology.
   Tamposi is one of six candidates in the 2nd District Republican
primary on Tuesday. Humphrey supports another candidate, Chuck
Douglas.
   After two days of insisting he wouldn't back down, Humphrey
apparently changed his mind after he got a call from Douglas.
   Humphrey issued the retraction. A spokesman for Tamposi said
Humphrey also telephoned her to apologize.
   ``I want to make it clear that I did not represent the Douglas
campaign in making statements critical of Betty Tamposi,'' said
Humphrey.
   ``Chuck Douglas is blameless. Neither he nor anyone in his
organization had advance knowledge of my statement,'' he said.
   At a Concord news conference Thursday, Douglas reiterated that
he had nothing to do with the remark.
   ``How she raises her children is her own business,'' said
Douglas. ``I have not delved into the personal lives of my
opponents nor will I.''

<TEXT>
   China said Thursday it told visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci it exports weapons in a responsible manner
but did not say if it halted missile shipments to Iran and Saudi
Arabia _ sales Washington opposes.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua told a weekly briefing:
``In meeting with Mr. Carlucci, the Chinese leaders reiterated the
policy of the Chinese government on the question of China's export
of military products.''
   He repeated China's assurances that it follows a ``serious and
responsible'' policy in selling arms and that there was no reason
to be concerned about China's arms trade.
   Carlucci told reporters Wednesday after two days of talks that
he was ``fully satisfied'' with Chinese assertions that its growing
arms sales to the Middle East and other areas of the world would
not have a destabilizing effect on those regions.
   He declined to say if China had changed its stand on arms sales
that include supplying Iran with Silkworm anti-ship missiles and
Saudi Arabia with medium-range ballistic missiles.
   The sales have strained Chinese-U.S. relations.
   Carlucci said Wednesday night that his talks with senior leader
Deng Xiaoping, Premier Li Peng, National Defense Minister Qin Jiwei
and others leaders were the ``best discussions we have ever had''
on arms sales, adding: ``I hope we can put this issue behind us.''
   Carlucci, on his first visit to China, left Beijing Thursday for
the ancient capital of Xian. He is also to visit a naval base in
Shanghai before concluding his five-day visit Saturday.
   At the Wednesday meeting with Deng, the 84-year-old leader said
he hoped Vice President George Bush, who headed the American
liaison office in Beijing in 1974-75, would win the presidential
election in November.
   Jin declined to clarify whether Deng's statement was personal or
reflected China's official position on the presidential race,
saying only that the elections were the internal affairs of the

   Congress adopted on Thursday a bill that would
allow the U.S. government to contract with Canada to use that
country's firefighting resources to battle Western forest fires.
   The legislation would allow the U.S. Forrest Service to
reimburse Canada, thereby allowing that nation to send firemen,
aircraft and other equipment. House Agriculture Committee staffers
said Canada has 35 planes ready and available.
   The U.S. government does not currently have the authority to
compensate the Canadians.
   ``The devastating forest fires we're seeing throughout the
Northwest are causing a devastating impact on the firefighting
capabilities of the U.S. government,'' said Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, chairman of the Agriculture Committee.

   The death toll rose to 56 in the Aug. 28 air show
disaster at a U.S. air base and a newspaper said Thursday that
insurance coverage of the Italian stunt-flying team involved falls
far short of estimated damage.
   An insurance official said, however, that organizers of such an
event usually pay the largest portion of the damage.
   Two more West Germans died of severe burns from the accident at
the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein and 28 people were reported in
critical condition. Two Americans are among the dead.
   Marco Fraquelli, an official of the Milano Assicurazioni
insurance company of Milan, Italy, said each of the three planes
that crashed was insured for $1.4 million, for a total of $4.2
million.
   The Berliner Morgenpost quoted Fraquelli as saying his company
expects damage claims from the crash of the three jets from the
Frecce Tricolori team to reach about $120 million.
   ``In case of disasters like the one in Ramstein, usually the
government and NATO agree on payment of damage to the victims and
their relatives,'' Fraquelli told The Associated Press.
   Three Italian stunt-flying jets collided at low altitude at the
air show and one hurtled into a crowd of spectators and exploded.
   Jurgen Dietzen, a spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate State
Interior Ministry said 160 people remained hospitalized.
   Dietzen said the last two deaths occurred between Wednesday and
Thursday.

   A dragnet for car thieves turned up a ``massive
forgers' den'' with thousands of bogus passports, car registrations
and other documents, and five people were arrested, police and
newspaper reports said Thursday.
   Scotland Yard said in a brief statement that police also seized
forged visas, marriage certificates, checkbooks, travelers checks,
foreign driving licences and birth certificates at the house at
Islington in north London.
   It identified the four men arrested as Refik Ozcan, 33; Hilni
Sehri, 33; Mustafa Yoldas, 26; and Hamit Ersozoglu, 36, all of
Turkey, and one woman, Ann Carnegie, 43, of Sweden.
   The Times of London said the five were arrested earlier this
week.
   The paper said that what police described as a ``massive
forgers' den'' was found by detectives from Scotland Yard's stolen
car squad during an operation that began as an investigation into
the theft of expensive rented cars in London's financial district.
   The paper said detectives described the documents as top-quality
forgeries. It said the center allegedly could supply a client with
a full new identity _ for a fee.
   The paper said the police haul included visa and landing stamps
for various countries for use with the forged passports.
   No details were given about possible clients, but The Times said
criminals ranging from terrorists to armed robbers would be ready
to pay a high price for a new identity to get them out of Britain.

   Christopher Keene, a 41-year-old conductor who
served as musical director of the New York City Opera, will succeed
Beverly Sills as the company's general director, an opera official
said Thursday.
   The City Opera board decided to appoint Keene at a Thursday
afternoon meeting, said Martin Oppenheimer, vice chairman of the
board.
   ``I can confirm that he was appointed as (general) director with
great enthusiasm by the board, and that enthusiasm is shared not
only by board members but by the staff and Beverly Sills,'' he said
in a telephone interview.
   Miss Sills, 59, announced in May that she would be resigning
effective Jan. 1 as general director of the nation's second-largest
opera company in terms of budget and number of performances.
   Oppenheimer called Keene ``one of the outstanding young
conductors of this country'' and noted that he was ``particularly
well known for his conducting of modern works.''
   Keene, who began his association with City Opera as winner of
the first Julias Rudel Award in 1969, was music director of the
company from 1983 to 1986, when he resigned the post.
   Since then, he has been head of a performing arts center in
Buffalo, N.Y., and head of the Long Island Philharmonic, said
Oppenheimer.
   The 44-year-old City Opera, with a budget of $26 million for
fiscal 1989 and a 20-week summer-fall season plus a spring musical
comedy season, is second in size to the Metropolitan Opera in New
York.

<TEXT>
   Nazi hunters from the United
States, Israel and other countries gathered Thursday to pay tribute
to a West German office that has helped track down war criminals
for 30 years.
   At a Thursday night reception at the Ludwigsburg Palace, West
German officials praised the office's work and said their
countrymen must remember the Nazi era so that such atrocities are
never committed again.
   ``We owe this office profound thanks for 30 years of work,''
said Ulrich Hartmann, a regional administrative official.
   The West German Central Office for the Investigation of Nazi War
Crimes has helped convict more than 6,000 people on various war
crimes charges since its founding in 1958.
   A total of 160 war criminals have been sentenced to life
imprisonment because of the office's work. Life in prison is the
highest possible sentence in West Germany, which has no death
penalty.
   Speakers at the reception said the search for Nazi war criminals
was far from over.
   ``Today, 30 years after the creation of the central office, the
job is still not done,'' said Heinz Eyrich, Baden Wuerttemberg
state's justice minister.
   Nazi hunters, including Simon Wiesenthal, traveled to
Ludwigsburg to attend a special symposium Friday marking the
anniversary of the Central Office. Others gathering for the event
were Nazi hunters from Austria, Israel and East bloc countries.
Neill Sher, from the office of special investigations for the U.S.
Justice Department, was also attending.
   Despite its successes, the Central Office _ like other groups
that track down suspected Nazi war criminals _ is having increasing
difficulty in its work because the crimes happened so long ago,
said Alfred Streim, head of the Ludwigsburg-based office.
   ``It is becoming more and more difficult to have a successful
case, because witnesses are dead or they don't want to talk
anymore,'' Streim told The Associated Press.
   ``Some of them (witnesses) just say `Please let me have my
peace,''' he said.
   Streim pointed to the Aug. 29 acquittal of former SS sergeant
Wolfgang Otto on charges of participating in the 1944 execution of
Ernst Thaelmann, head of Germany's Communist Party.
   Otto was convicted in 1986 but a higher court overturned the
verdict saying there was no evidence to prove that Otto had been at
the scene of Thaelmann's execution.
   The appeals court acquitted Otto for the same reason, having to
rely on evidence from the original trial.
   But Streim's office continues to contribute to some significant
successes even though the crimes occurred long ago.
   In January of this year, a West German court convicted Gottfried
Weise, a former SS guard at the Nazis' Auschwitz concentration camp.
   The 66-year-old Weise, charged with fatally shooting five
Auschwitz inmates including an 8-year-old child, was sentenced to
life in prison.

   A Moslem religious court on
Thursday fined an unwed couple $570 for committing illicit sex
after the two lived together for 24 years and produced seven
children, a newpaper reported.
   The New Straits Times daily said Friday that the court in
Taiping, 150 miles north of this capital city, fined Yusof Bin
Janid, 51, and his partner Jariah Mohamad Ali, 46, after they
pleaded guilty of committing ``zina'' (illicit sex) since 1962.
   Janid, a public works department worker, and Jariah paid the
fines.
   The two separated two years ago and Jariah said she had no
intention of marrying Yusof.
   Judge Sulaiman Ismail rejected pleas that the two were
illiterate, saying they could have easily sought advice as they
were living in a Moslem community.

<TEXT>
   A businessman who offered to
``adopt'' a welfare family and move them out of a Miami slum
neighborhood pleaded guilty Thursday to a bank fraud charge,
federal prosecutors said.
   The generous offer, made in mid-July to a nationwide television
audience on NBC's ``Today Show,'' generated publicity for James N.
Gisclair, who was initially described as a millionaire although
later it was learned he was heavily in debt.
   Gisclair, 43, owner of the Green Machine Landscaping Co. in Boca
Raton, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of
submitting a false statement, a charge that carries a maximum
penalty of two years in prison, a $250,000 fine and restitution.
Sentencing was set for Nov. 3.
   The criminal charge stems from a civil case in which Capitol
Factors Inc., a subsidiary of Miami-based Capital Bank, won a
judgment against Gisclair in Palm Beach Circuit Court.
   Gisclair allegedly submitted to the bank about $1 million worth
of false or irregular invoices for work that was never done or
contracted for, according to court documents.
   Among Gisclair's philanthropic intentions were to give Anita
Hunter a new house, a new car and a new life away from the
drug-ridden Miami neighborhood dubbed ``The Hole.''
   Ms. Hunter, a welfare mother of five, had called the offer
nothing short of a miracle. Gisclair later apparently moved Ms.
Hunter out, according to her neighbors, although her whereabouts
are not known.

   The wind-driven flames of a raging
forest fire were raining down on this remote northwestern Montana
town the other night when some of its people ignored the evacuation
order and made a stand.
   ``The way the fire was burning and the way it came over those
trees, I didn't expect anything to be here,'' Buck Kates said
Thursday. ``It looked like it was raining embers all over those
trees. It hit and just bounced and the whole works went up.''
   But when the flames had passed Wednesday night, the town's only
businesses were still standing, thanks to Kates and others who
braved a wall of fire to hose down the buildings.
   Polebridge, tucked into the forest on the west edge of Glacier
National Park, has a general store listed on the National Register
of Historic Places, a bar, restaurant and a dozen other buildings.
   Residents were told Wednesday to evacuate as the 14,000-acre Red
Bench fire drew near, but Kates and several others stayed behind
with a tanker truck to save Polebridge while the fire devastated
the surrounding countryside.
   ``I seen what they were doing, and I figured, hell, if they're
going to stay, I will, too,'' he said. ``You're too busy to get
scared.''
   Kates said the crew made two-mile runs to Hay Creek, filled the
truck with water and then drove back to hose down the buildings.
They didn't stop until their path to the creek was blocked by
flames.
   The historic Polebridge Mercantile was saved, as was the Great
Northern Saloon and restaurant.
   The fire was burning Thursday in Glacier National Park, having
jumped the North Fork of the Flathead River on Wednesday. Dozens of
cabins, homes and ranch buildings were destroyed north of
Polebridge, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   The presence of U.S. military forces and
Nicaraguan rebels in Honduras is temporary, the vice president of
the Honduran Congress said Thursday in the Cuban capital of Havana.
   ``There is no support in the Honduran Congress for a permanent
U.S. military base,'' Jose Antonio Fernandez Guzman was quoted as
saying by the Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina.
   In a dispatch monitored in Mexico City, Prensa Latina quoted
Fernandez Guzman as saying that irregular forces of any nationality
must not remain in his country.
   Honduras has served as a staging ground and supply route for
U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, since 1981. U.S.
troops there routinely conduct military exercises with Honduran
forces.
   ``Any convention or treaty to install U.S. military bases in
Honduran territory necessarily would have to be approved by the
legislature, where there is no support for a project of this
nature,'' Fernandez Guzman said.
   Guzman heads an 11-member Honduran congressional delegation
visiting Cuba at the invitation of Cuba's National Popular Power
Assembly, a legislative organ of the island nation's communist
government.
   It is the first visit to Cuba by a Honduran congressional
delegation since the government of President Fidel Castro took
power in 1959.
   The Hondurans plan to tour scientific, cultural and economic
projects throughout Cuba before leaving on Sept. 15, Prensa Latina
said.

   ``The `debate about debates,' ... began a few weeks ago in low

<HEAD>Koala, Platypus Exports Banned By State of New South Wales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New South Wales on Friday became the
first state in Australia to ban koala and platypus exports, saying
that sending the marsupials to zoos overseas amounted to a virtual
death sentence.
   ``Their survival rate is unacceptable,'' said New South Wales
Environment Minister Tim Moore. ``We simply cannot guarantee their
safety.''
   News reports noted that Moore announced the ban after a Japanese
request for three more koalas and a pair of platypuses to boost
Japan's breeding program.
   At least eight koalas have died in overseas zoos in the last
three years, five of them in Japan. Besides Japan, the only other
overseas zoos with koalas are at San Diego and Los Angeles.
   Moore also ruled that no platypuses be sent overseas until more
research is done into their failure to breed in captivity.
Zoologists said only one pair of platypuses had bred in captivity
in Australia during the past 40 years.
   The pouched animals are unique to Australia.
   Moore said he was not suggesting there is anything wrong with
conditions in Japanese zoos but that Australia was probably the
only country with veterinary surgeons skilled in the treatment of
koalas.
   He said most deaths seemed to be caused by stress and chlamydia,
a venereal disease that has been ravaging koala colonies in recent
years. Moore did not mention old age as a cause of death.
   Moore said the export ban would remain in force until there is
an immunization program for chlamydia or methods found to deal with
koala stress.
   Koalas feed on only a few varieties of eucalyptus trees and are
found only on the east coast of Australia.
   A spokesman for federal Environment Minister Graham Richardson
said exports of koalas and platypuses already are restricted
because the animals fall under the category of rare or endangered
species.

   Oscar-winning cinematographer Hal
Rosson, director of photography for such classic films as ``The
Wizard of Oz'' and ``Singin' In The Rain,'' has died at age 93.
   Rosson, who died Tuesday, is credited with work on at least 133
films in a career spanning the early days of silent films to the
talkies to the golden age of the new megastudios.
   His film credits also include such movies as ``Tarzan the Ape
Man,'' ``No Time for Sergeants,'' ``Treasure Island,'' and ``El
Dorado,'' his last film.
   Born in New York, he got his first work in films about 1912 with
Metro Pictures Corp.
   The first color film that he worked on, ``The Gardens of
Allah,'' won the Academy Award for color in 1936.
   His use of black-and-white turning to startling color in ``The
Wizard Of Oz'' was copied by dozens of other filmmakers.
   ``He really was a wonderful person and a wonderful contributor
here in Hollywood,'' said Jean Turner, spokesman for the American
Society of Cinematographers in Los Angeles.
   Briefly married to actress Jean Harlow in the 1930s, Rosson had
a family tradition of involvement in film. His brother Arthur
Rosson was a successful director and his sister was secretary to
film magnate Cecil B. DeMille for 35 years.
   Rosson came out of retirement to work on the 1967 John Wayne
film, ``El Dorado.'' He moved to Palm Beach in 1973.
   Funeral arrangements were planned in Hollywood, Calif.

   A barge ran aground and cracked open Thursday
near Natchez, Miss., spilling more than 5,000 gallons of a
flammable chemical into the Mississippi River, the U.S. Coast Guard
said.
   The Coast Guard revised its initial estimate of a 40,000-gallon
spill after closing a 50-mile stretch of the river to shipping _
from the point of the spill to Angola, La. The river would reopen
early Friday, officials said.
   The barge was loaded with styrene, a clear chemical which floats
on water and catches fire easily, Meidt said. Authorities said the
vapors can irritate the eyes and throat and can cause loss of
consciousness. Direct contact with styrene can burn the skin.
   The chemical is used principally in the manufacture of plastic
and rubber.
   Meidt said a tug owned by Apex Towing Co. of St. Louis, Mo., was
pushing 13 barges when at least one went aground and cracked.
   At least three crew members reported some queasiness after the
accident, but they did not seek immediate medical attention, he
said.
   The cause of the accident had not been determined, he said.
   The styrene began drifting downstream immediately. Meidt said
there was little evidence of the chemical spill at Natchez Thursday
afternoon.
   ``The cleanup is being facilitated by nature,'' he said.
   Farther down river, a containment boom described by officials as
a floating fence was suspended in the water to stop the chemical
from flowing into the Atchafalaya River.
   The Coast Guard did not known how long the river would be closed
to traffic. No northbound vessels were reported waiting and only
one southbound vessel was stopped near Natchez, Meidt said.
   Asked if the low water level of the drought-stricken Mississippi
River contributed to the accident, Lt. Cmdr. Robert Pond said,
``It's certainly a possibility.''

   Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle
shifted from his attacks on Democrat Michael Dukakis on Thursday,
delivering a foreign policy speech praising what he said were
Reagan administration gains and expressing skepticism about the
Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet Union ... will always be an adversary, will always
be a competitor,'' he said.
   Addressing the City Club of Chicago, the Indiana senator spoke
in off-the-cuff remarks, tossing out a speech text that had been
prepared by his staff and approved by the Bush campaign.
   His press secretary David Prosperi had said the speech would be
the first of several designed to showcase Quayle's experience on
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The text went into great detail about weapons systems and
national security philosophy.
   In his remarks as delivered, Quayle said there had been foreign
policy gains in places such as Grenada and Afghanistan during the
Reagan years. He also praised the president for the arms-reduction
treaty with the Soviet Union and criticized Congress for
``micromanagement'' of foreign policy.
   He emphasized what he said was a need for a skeptical attitude
toward the Soviet Union, saying, ``The jury is still out'' on
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's commitment to reforms in
Eastern Europe and whether he will honor treaty agreements and
human rights progress.
   Quayle said in his speech the Soviets must demonstrate whether
they will allow their citizens wishing to leave to do so or ``are
they going to selectively let out one or two at a time, have a lot
of publicity about it and get brownie points for that.''
   Prosperi said afterward that Quayle ``stands behind the text''
that had been released earlier to reporters but that he decided not
to read it because ``that's his style.'' Prosperi said of the
speech changes that Quayle ``beefed it up quite a bit based upon
his own expertise.''
   He said Quayle was not rebelling against a text written
principally by others, and had informed his advisers ahead of time
that he would not be delivering it.
   Quayle has a team of top political advisers put together by the
Bush campaign.
   On one of the only specific points that he took from the
prepared text, Quayle said the War Powers Act should be ``repealed
or drastically rewritten.''
   While hitting some of the same themes that were outlined in his
prepared speech, Quayle did not go into the same detailed analysis
for pushing forward with research and testing of the Strategic
Defense Initiative, or for his call for Europe and Japan to share
more of the cost of their own defense.
   Senior adviser Ken Kachigian said later that ``there's nothing
mysterious'' about Quayle's abandoning the text.
   ``He had the speech, he had no problem with it,'' Kachigian
said, but Quayle is ``so familiar with the subject matter'' that he
felt more comfortable speaking from his own outline.
   He said the staff knew that when the text was passed out to
reporters on the plane that Quayle would not deliver it verbatim.
   As the initial controversy over his National Guard service and
personal background subsides, the 41-year-old Quayle is seeking to
project himself as a substantive politician.
   In another matter, The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer reported in its
Friday editions that Quayle entered law school in 1970 through an
experimental program that was a precursor to affirmative action
efforts at the Indiana University law school.
   The Plain Dealer said the law school admissions program was
intended to offer ``equal opportunity'' to minorities, the
economically disadvantaged and other ``students of different
viewpoints and backgrounds.''
   Quayle spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the program was for ``kids who
didn't make the first cut but showed promise, had something in
their application that showed they had what it would take. In Dan's
case, graduation from one of the finest colleges in the Midwest,
DePauw ... the Harvard of the Midwest, the top of the top.''
   Quayle generally has refrained from attacking Lloyd Bentsen, the
Democratic vice presidential candidate who has a long, high-profile
congressional record, but has instead targeted Dukakis, blasting
the Massachusetts governor as being weak on defense and
inexperienced in foreign policy.
   Although he did not mention the Democratic ticket in the Chicago
speech, because the audience was a non-partisan group, Quayle went
back on the offensive in Springfield, Ill.
   ``Americans are not going to turn over the peace and prosperity
to some inexperienced governor of Massachusetts,'' he said.
   In the text of the City Club speech, Quayle said that ``the
foremost threat to our existence and to our values comes, still,
from the Soviet Union.'' He said Gorbachev's new openness and
restructuring policies will produce economic gains that may only
benefit ``the Soviet military machine.''
   The text also went into defense burden-sharing with the allies,
saying this nation should plan ``a harmonious approach of
responsibility-sharing between the United States and our allies.''

   A late-summer surge in gasoline prices fueled
wholesale inflation in August at a pace matching the highest level
of the year, even though food prices began recovering from the
drought, the government said Friday.
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for finished
goods rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent last month, the
heftiest increase since an identical rise in March.
   If that rate held for 12 consecutive months, inflation at the
wholesale level would amount to 6.9 percent, more than triple the
2.2 percent price rise for 1987. For the first eight months of
1988, wholesale inflation was running at an annual rate of 4.3
percent.
   White House officials said they were unconcerned about the news.
   ``Fluctuations of this size are commonly observed,'' said
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``We still believe inflation is under

   Window service at the nation's post offices,
cut last February to save money, is being restored starting
Saturday.
   Most post offices cut hours by about a half-day a week to help
cope with $160 million in congressionally imposed spending cuts.
The service reductions came two months before postage rate hikes,
which took nearly a year to put into effect, were instituted to
cope with a rising deficit by the Postal Service.
   The unexpected spending reduction came as part of overall cuts
in government expenditures aimed at reducing the budget deficit,
even though the Postal Service no longer receives a taxpayer
subsidy.
   While the the postal window hours will be restored, the new
hours will not necessarily be the same as those that were in effect
at each office before the closings were imposed, officials said.
   Local managers were given the option to adjust hours to suit the

   ``We ought to pass this now and not put it off and deprive
American workers of jobs they could have,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond,

   The bill, aimed at protecting American manufacturers from
foreign competition, would freeze this year's imports of textiles,
apparel and non-rubber footwear at 1987 levels and limit their
growth to one percent annually thereafter.
   It also would bar foreign manufacturers of non-rubber footwear

   In an unprecedented move, the State Department
announced Friday tentative approval of a plan to allow the export

   The announcement represented a victory for the State Department,
which overrode contentions by the Transportation Department and
private industry that the deal will place U.S. producers of
satellite launchers at a competitive disadvantage.
   The plan was denounced by Martin Marietta Corp., which makes
rockets for commercial use, and by members of Congress who saw it
as undermining the U.S. aerospace industry and causing the loss of
thousands of Amerrican jobs, among other threats.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., introduced legislation to ban such

<HEAD>`USA Today: The Television Show' _ TV Version of Newspaper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tonight ``USA Today: The Television Show'' meets
USA: The Television Audience.
   According to its producers, the show intends to avoid the icky,
ugly side of the news and concentrate on ``journalism of hope,''
often presented in the form of a video version of the polls that
are a staple of the newspaper of the same name.
   The premise sounds like ``happy news,'' a red flag to TV
critics, and has elicited concerned comments that the show, if
successful, might have the same kind of impact on television news
that USA Today has had on some newspapers, which, it seems, have
been forced to become more colorful and entertaining.
   So far broadcast journalism has survived Fox's ``A Current
Affair'' and the more recent, hootable ``The Reporters.'' Geraldo
Rivera became a talk-show host and the walls of government are
still standing.
   There's no reason journalism won't also survive ``USA Today: The
Television Show,'' which doesn't really threaten to be anymore than
yet another TV newsmagazine, albeit a nightly half-hour one, jazzed
up with expensive graphics and network-level talent.
   The show comes from some responsible folks: Grant Tinker, the
former head of MTM Productions and NBC; and Gannett, the publisher
of USA Today, the newspaper. The show's studios are at the
newspaper headquarters in Rosslyn, Va. The executive producer is
Steve Friedman, former executive producer of NBC's ``Today'' show.
   The show was quickly sold to about 160 stations, an indication
the stations expect a hit.
   ``I think we will have a success,'' said Tinker at a news
conference in July. ``I think we may get a few people expressing
disappointment in that first week, because they were looking for
magic, and all we're giving them is a very presentable show.''
   ``USA Today'' is indeed presentable. The graphics will knock
your socks off. The anchors are telegenic beyond belief; it's as if
everybody who was popular in junior high school when you weren't
ended up on the same television show.
   USA Today, the newspaper, serves as something of a generic
libretto for the TV version, which is partitioned into four
sections, like the paper. There is the USA front-page section,
reported by Edie Magnus; the Money section, reported by anchorman
Kenneth Walker; Sports, reported by Bill Macatee, and the Life
section, reported by Robin Young.
   The Cover Story will come from whatever section looms largest
that night. This week, the Cover Story is a series called ``Living
in America,'' an examination of a poll of American attitudes about
romance, physical appearance, kids, finances and the future.
   Other feature reports are on the Olympics, a school where
ambassadors learn to fend off terrorist attacks and tough New
Jersey school Principal Joe Clark.
   These are all typical stories for any TV newsmagazine. A slick,
watchable, more immediate style is what the producers of ``USA
Today: The Television Show'' hope will make it different.
   There will be no sadness or desolation.
   The first show was not available in time for reviewing, but
Friedman and Tinker showed a prototype to TV critics in July that
included a report on the drought in the Midwest. The story was not
about the devastation, but rather about Nebraska, which is doing
just fine, thank you, thanks to its vast, natural underground water
supply.
   Friedman argued that the piece taught people something. True,
but how many people spinning by on remote control are just going to
pick up the subliminal message, ``Drought? No problem.''
   ``We can't go out and say, `Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
The Dow Jones industrials lost 200 points today, but don't worry,
there's still 2,000 to go,''' said Friedman, but he added, ``We
would rather deal with problem solvers than problem causers. We're
not saying that dealing with problem causers is wrong, it's just
that most people are doing that. We choose to do something else.''
   So can TV viewers.

   Elsewhere in television:
   THE NEWS TIMES ARE A-CHANGING _ The New York affiliate has moved
the ``CBS Evening News'' from 7 p.m. EDT to 6:30 p.m., putting it
against ``ABC World News Tonight,'' so the ``NBC Nightly News'' now
has the 7 p.m. slot to itself. In the first two days after the
change, NBC saw a rise in its New York rating of 45 percent. The
increase might not continue, but even if it does, says NBC, it
would only make a change of 0.2 in the national rating. In the most
recent Nielsens, NBC lagged behind second-place ABC by 0.4 and
behind CBS by 0.8. A 1.0 rating represents 1 percent of the
nation's 88.6 million television homes. The time change did not
significantly affect the ratings for CBS and ABC.

<HEAD>Band Members Lament Passing Of a Texas Playboy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   During the hot days of a Texas summer,
scratched-up, old records would probably suffice for a true fan of
Bob Wills and the ``Texas Playboys.''
   ``But there's nothing like live music,'' said Leon Rausch, who
used to play guitar for the band. Rausch is concerned that Western
swing, as Wills made it, might not be around much longer.
   ``I couldn't hold a beer joint job these days because I couldn't
keep up with the tunes,'' the 60-year-old Rausch figured. ``These
younger guys are playing what they do to make a living.
   ``I know you have to change with the times, but I sure would
hate to see what we did fade away.''
   Leon McAuliffe, who played steel guitar for the band from 1935
to 1942 and, with Wills, wrote the classic ``San Antonio Rose,''
took a lot of the band's history with him when he died Aug. 20 at
the age of 71.
   Some say he could make that steel guitar talk like no one else.
   Old band members hope to put it together again and remember
Wills and McAuliffe, who led the band after Wills' death and was
the chief spokesman for the Texas Playboys in the latter years.
   Herb Remington, who played steel guitar for Wills from 1946 to
'51 and now lives in Houston, said a group of former band members
now calling themselves ``Playboys II'' played at a recent Western
Swing festival in Canton, Texas.
   ``We all attribute our careers to Bob Wills,'' the 62-year-old
Remington said. ``You would have enjoyed the band.''
   As for the absence of McAuliffe, said Johnny Gimble, who fiddled
for the band from 1949 to 1951, ``I think Leon's in a lot better
shape than anybody now. He's in heaven.''
   Gimble, also 62, said hundreds of musicians played with the band
over the years and that Wills made them all better than they
originally were.
   ``Everbody claims to have played with Bob Wills,'' Gimble said
from his home in Round Rock, Texas. ``I think when I was in the
band, there were about 350 claiming to have played with him. There
are a lot of them still in Texas.''
   And although many of them are alive and still playing, ``The
band was never on fire after he died,'' he said. ``The audience
came to see him. It's one of those things you can't put your finger
on.''
   McAuliffe and the others decided to regroup in 1973 to work on a
Texas Playboys retrospective LP, but Wills suffered a stroke before
the album, ``For the Last Time,'' was finished, and died in 1975.
   After veteran Texas Playboys pianist Al Stricklin died in 1986,
the band staged what was intended to be a final concert at Will
Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth on Nov. 16, 1986.
   McAuliffe said the band had decided not to go out one by one and
with Stricklin gone, the Texas Playboys would play no more.
   ``We loved each other, and we loved Al,'' McAuliffe said at the
time.
   However, the band came together one more time to film with such
country artists as Mel Tillis, George Strait and Willie Nelson an
Austin City Limits public television music program _ a special
tribute to Wills _ that ironically aired only hours after McAuliffe
died.
   Rausch said the band's music came from Wills' mind and influence
from other music, such as the Big Band sound, Mexican horn music
and blues from the 1920s.
   ``His favorite singer was Bessie Smith, the biggest black singer
of his day, in the 20s,'' Rausch said. ``He thought Bessie Smith
hung the moon.''
   In his early days, Rausch said, Wills used mostly string
instruments.
   ``He decided to put horns in his band to compete with big dance
bands,'' Rausch said. ``They didn't want to hear just a fiddle and
a guitar in a big dance hall. He took a little sampling of this and
a little sampling of that and put it all together.''
   Band members say when it was all put together, there was nothing
like it.
   ``You can hear it in the records,'' Gimble said. ``He might not
have anything to do with what you do, but he inspired you.''
   According to Rausch, the word ``inspire'' is an understatement.
When Wills used his famous, ``Ahhh (fill in the blank with any band
member's name), take it away,'' they'd take it away.
   ``He was a whale of a guy,'' he said. ``Guys didn't even think
they could play until the old man pointed at them. You'd give him
115 percent when he pointed at you.
   ``He was always hollering for you to do something, and you
jumped in there and did what you did. When he jumped up and down
and hollered that stuff, it drove people crazy.''

   Like other frequent fliers, pilots suffer the
effects of jet lag and sleep loss from flight delays, late arrivals
and crossing time zones. For them, however, the consequences are
potentially disastrous. The second story of a three-part AP Extra
series, ``6 Miles Up and Sleepy,'' describes the growing medical
evidence showing how fatigue and disruption of the body's
biological clock upset performance in the cockpit.

   When pilots struggle to hold their eyes open on late night
flights, they are fighting the rhythms of their own bodies, the
built-in timekeepers that rule their cycles of sleep and alertness.
   Pilots' schedules often require them to get up early, stay up
late or fly at times when their bodies tell them they should be
fast asleep.
   Sleep experts say the effects on the pilots are clear: They grow
agonizingly drowsy when they should be alert, but at bedtime they
frequently have trouble nodding off. The result is a potentially
dangerous combination of inattention and cumulative sleep loss.
   ``Just as we want our planes maintained so mechanical factors
don't crash them, we should equally be concerned about the
maintenance of our pilots so biological problems don't crash
them,'' said Dr. David Dinges, a sleep expert at the University of
Pennsylvania.
   When people traveled by ship, they crossed one time zone a day.
Their bodies adapted easily. Now jets span five or six time zones
in a single night. The human body cannot keep up.
   Under a fairly typical long-haul schedule, a crew might fly from
San Francisco to London one day, to Seattle the next, then back to
London to Seattle to London to Seattle. In eight days, they cross
time zones 48 times.
   A vacationer landing in London after one of those legs might
feel wooly for a couple of days, but no harm is done. However, for
the pilot crisscrossing the planet, there is no chance to recover
from jet leg. The price: A spiraling sleep debt.
   While flights that span continents and oceans provide the most
dramatic examples of sleep disruption, shorter domestic trips can
be exhausting, too. A pilot's work day can last 16 hours. Experts
say that after a late evening arrival, there often is simply not
enough time for a decent night's sleep between check-in at the
hotel and the trip back to the airport for the next day's duty.
   If a pilot gets just one hour less sleep than normal each night,
the debt after several days can significantly weaken attention,
diligence and motivation.
   ``Pilots have disrupted sleep and significantly shortened sleep
while away from home,'' said Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, a sleep expert
at Harvard Medical School. ``Over longer distances ... they find
themselves fatigued, are inalert in the cockpit and drop off to
sleep.''
   Pilots, of course, are not alone in this. Single-vehicle traffic
accidents, in which cars and trucks simply veer off the road, are
most likely to happen in the middle of the night.
   So are industrial accidents. The nuclear power plant disasters
at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl resulted from mistakes made in
the small hours.
   In the last two decades, many experiments on volunteers have
documented the effects of working and thinking while short of sleep
or out of synchronism with the body's built-in clock, the circadian
system.
   This research underscores the belief that fatigue is as risky
for pilots as it is for nuclear plant operators and long-haul
truckers or anyone else who must make life-and-death decisions. But
proving this in the cockpit is difficult.
   No blood test can measure sleepiness after a crash or near miss.
Even if one could, a crash almost always results from a series of
mistakes and bad luck; fatigue may be only one link in the chain of
disaster. So a few sleep experts have begun flying with pilots to
see what really goes on.
   ``I've been all over the world with these guys. I know what
happens,'' said Dr. R. Curtis Graeber, a psychologist at the
NASA-Ames Research Center at Moffett Field in California.
   ``We've seen fuel mismanagement, two engines being flamed out
and nobody could figure out why for 20 minutes,'' he said. ``We've
seen tires blown because the brakes were mis-set.''
   Was fatigue to blame? ``There's no smoking gun,'' Graeber said.
``I can't prove to you that the guy mismanaged the fuel because he
was tired, but I can tell you that he did it on the segment in
which we had seen the greatest fatigue. We don't tend to see those
errors on the first flight of the trip.''

   Graeber and others hook pilots and engineers to monitors while
they fly. They hope to see whether crew members make more mistakes
when such physical signs as body temperature and heartbeat suggest
they are less alert.
   Much of that data is still being collected and analyzed. But
Graeber said it's clear that by the third night of such schedules
as the San Francisco-London-Seattle tour, the cockpit crew becomes
increasingly lethargic.
   Dr. Mary Carskadon of Brown University has shown in the
laboratory what Graeber sees in the cockpit: The effects of lost
sleep accumulate over time.
   ``Most people, particularly those who are trained as pilots are,
can cope with the effects of chronic sleep deprivation fairly well
most of the time,'' she said. ``But ... a vulnerability is set up
that puts them at risk for catastrophic events to occur.''
   Experts say that when people are tired, they become sloppy.
Motivation flags, inertia sets in. They take short-cuts and ignore
small details.
   Flying a big plane, however, is mostly a matter of paying
attention to small details _ setting instruments, following
checklists, getting weather reports, watching dials.
   ``It's the errors of omission that occur because of lapses in
attention that are the hallmark of fatigue-related accidents,''
said Dr. Charles Czeisler of Harvard Medical School. Such omissions
would include not ``noticing an indicator that's not right,
anticipating a problem before it occurs, thinking many steps down
the line,'' he said.
   Sometimes pilots and flight engineers fall asleep. On long
cruises, especially over oceans, this is not terribly dangerous as
long as someone in the cockpit stays awake. But sleep is
contagious. The sleep experts say their research has turned up many
tales of entire crews nodding off.
   Another concern is micro-sleep, a shadowy state in which people
are half asleep. With the brain waves of sleep intruding on those
of wakefulness, people in this condition can continue to perform
duties while only vaguely aware of what's going on around them.
   ``It's much worse than being, frankly, fully asleep, because
they can continue to carry out routine tasks,'' said Czeisler. ``If
they were truly asleep, someone else at least might notice.''
   These problems occur, in part, because jet travel ignores the
circadian timekeeper, the product of millions of years of evolution
on a planet rotating once each 24 hours. Each day, the clock
oversees a symphony of changes in body temperature, alertness and
hormonal secretions, all of them geared to roughly a 24-hour cycle.
   For most people, the daily swing reaches its low point from 3:30
to 5 a.m. This is when they are sleepiest. There is another, less
pronounced, valley of drowsiness in the afternoon from 4 to 5. The
body temperature is also lowest at these times.
   Consider the pilot who leaves California on a late-night,
cross-country flight. Even if he slept during the day, he's likely
to feel sleepy early in the morning as his body temperature falls.
By the time he checks into a New York hotel, his body temperature
is rising again _ his body clock is telling him to wake up. Even
though he is tired, sleep is difficult. He awakens feeling ragged
and has to fly again.
   ``The pilot who flies across multiple time zones faces the
problem that his body continues at the old time zone,'' said
Dinges. ``He is forced to try to sleep when his body clock wants
him to be awake and to be awake when his body clock wants him to
sleep.''

   Today's federal rules for pilot rest and duty hours come out of
the era of the DC-3, when propeller-driven airliners droned along
at speeds less than 200 mph and took eight hours to fly from New
York to Miami.
   Revised in 1964 and again in 1985, many of the Federal Air
Regulations differ little from rules first issued in the 1930s.
   Crews for large airlines on domestic routes can't be scheduled
to fly longer than eight hours between required rest periods. They
can't fly more than 30 hours in seven days; 100 hours a month and
1,000 hours a year. Crews may exceed the eight-hour limit if their
scheduled flights are delayed by weather, traffic or equipment
problems.
   Commuter airline pilots may fly 34 hours in 7 days; 120 hours in
a month and 1,200 a year.
   Crews must be given at least nine hours' rest in a 24-hour
period. However, that can be cut to eight hours if the next rest
period is increased by two to three hours, based on an FAA formula.
   Three-member international crews can fly up to 12 hours a day;
they must get 18 hours' rest if they fly more than 24 hours in 72
hours or 20 hours within 48 hours. Larger crews can fly longer;
two-member crews can fly only eight hours between rest periods.
   However, the rules don't speak to duty hours _ measured from the
time a pilot reports to the airport, usually an hour before first
takeoff, through the day's schedule including sitting on the ground
between flights, to departure after the final flight. Such
reckoning can stretch a crew's time on the job to 16 hours.
   West Germany, Britain and the Netherlands limit their pilots'
hours by calculating duty time, the number of takeoffs and
landings, the time of day and the number of time zones crossed.
   None of these factors is considered under U.S. commercial
regulations.
   The latest FAA rules are the result of so-called ``regulation by
negotiation.'' Union and airline representatives met in 1983-84
with FAA officials and a mediator to work out minor changes in
domestic rules.
   These rules are often used by airlines and their unions as a
baseline for schedules stricter than government guidelines.
   ``Our own rules go on beyond the FAR (federal air
regulations),'' said George Hof, head of American Airlines flight
operations. ``We find the FAR is a place to begin.''
   FAA administrator T. Allan McArtor strongly denies federal
regulations run second in safety to union contracts.
   ``Our standard is not the thinnest ice you can skate on,'' he
said.
   Yet in 1975 an FAA investigation of a series of Pan American
crashes in the Pacific raised questions about the adequacy of FAA
regulations.
   Dr. Stanley Mohler, then chief of the FAA's Aeromedical
Applications Division, suggested U.S. regulators look to the
factors that the Europeans use to set flying limits.
   ``It was the feeling at the FAA to leave it up to the unions to
negotiate relative to their airlines' specific type of flying,''
said Mohler, now head of aerospace medicine at Wright State
University. ``It seemed to make sense, up until deregulation.''
   With deregulation, airlines stretched into new markets, added
new routes and faced new competition. Efforts to cut costs and keep
fares low put pressure on various parts of the industry, including
the pilots. According to the Airline Pilots Association, the
average pilot flies 13 percent more each month today than 10 years
ago.
   McArtor says he has an open mind to change. The FAA is
supporting fatigue research being done by NASA on several airlines.
   ``I don't know of any carrier that won't voluntarily do all they
can to ensure efficiency in the cockpit,'' he said. ``But I don't
believe we know all that we will know about this phenomenon. As we
understand it better, the scheduling, I think, will reflect that.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Airline pilots must fly when passengers want to
travel: early in the morning, late at night, across continents and
oceans, regardless of the vagaries of delays and bad weather.
Despite these grueling schedules, however, dangerous fatigue is not
inevitable. This final story in a three-part AP Extra series, ``6
Miles Up and Sleepy,'' examines ways of coping with sleepiness in
the cockpit.

   One often-proposed solution to the dangers of pilot fatigue is
legalization of a remedy that is obvious and widely practiced, but
forbidden _ naps in the cockpit.
   Passengers may blanch at the idea of their captain snoozing
while they watch a movie six miles above the Earth. But sleep
researchers contend this is a sensible way to cope with the flight
crew exhaustion caused by late-night arrivals, early-morning
departures and time-zone crossings.
   While air travel is generally safe, the experts say it could be
safer still if human frailties were considered in the design of
flight rules, pilot schedules and the planes themselves.
   Some in the flying business, however, are reluctant to
acknowledge fatigue as a concern. The Federal Aviation
Administration has publically voiced skepticism that sleepy pilots
create a hazard in the skies. The airlines seem to fear that
proposed rule changes would make scheduling more difficult, and
some pilots fret that they would lose the large blocks of free time
they now enjoy.
   Industry observers, moreover, contend that one of the most
powerful impediments to change is the very image of the airline
pilot: fit, trim and male, calm, confident and capable. Surely such
a person can deal with a little thing like sleepiness.
   ``There is a widely held belief that mental toughness, good
management or physical fitness will overcome sleepiness. That is
categorically incorrect,'' said Dr. David Dinges, a sleep
researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. ``Your brain still
needs sleep, and you get yoursef into serious trouble when you try
to tough that out.''
   Several approaches are being considered: cockpits that monitor
their operators, medicines that help flight crews sleep when off
duty, schedules that figure in the time of departure and the
direction of travel as well as the length of the work day.
   But one of the easiest and simplest solutions is the nap.
   ``It's common knowledge that people are napping in the cockpit
because they are so tired,'' said R. Curtis Graeber, a sleep
scientist at the NASA-Ames Research Center in California. ``We are
looking very closely at the potential safety benefits of allowing
limited napping in the seat.''
   The U.S. Air Force encourages its crews to nap on long cargo
flights, and some foreign countries, Britain and West Germany among
them, allow sleeping in airline cockpits. Under Federal Aviation
Administration rules, however, napping is considered careless and
reckless operation of the aircraft.
   Yet on the long mid-flight stretches across continents and
oceans, pilots have little to do but monitor their dials. Nature
takes its course. In interviews with The Associated Press, pilots
reported frightening instances of awakening to find their two
colleagues sound asleep as the airliner cruises through the night
skies.
   Graeber proposes that naps be carefully scheduled so each member
of the flight crew anticipates a rest period.
   ``Napping will be very helpful, if it's ever implemented,''
agreed Mary Carskadon, a sleep researcher at Brown University. ``It
makes so much more sense to schedule it in than to all of a sudden
have all three members of the flight crew asleep because no one is
scheduled to sleep.''
   Far more difficult, the experts agree, is improving pilot
schedules. Rules set by the FAA and union agreements dictate how
many hours a day pilots can be on duty and in the air. But the
standards allow myriad permutations of day and night departures and
arrivals that often leave crews out of synchronism with their
internal circadian clocks.
   ``I think pilot scheduling is as good as it can be right now
reflecting what we know,'' said Alan McArtor, head of the FAA. ``As
we understand it better, the scheduling, I think, will reflect
that.''
   McArtor and airline officials are awaiting results of research
now being conducted jointly by NASA, the Airline Pilots Association
and United Airlines.
   Beginning this fall, Graeber and other researchers will fly with
pilots on long, over-ocean routes, monitoring their body
temperatures and brain waves as they fly through the night.
   The resulting advice may not please either pilots or airlines.
   Pilots, often vehement critics of schedules, might find their
flight time spread over a longer calendar period, eliminating the
intense two to three weeks of flying that gives them the rest of
the month off.

   Airlines, already pinched by deregulatory competition and a
pilot shortage, may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying
additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced
schedules.
   FAA scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s,
when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a
day. Among those who think they can be improved is John Lauber, a
sleep researcher on the National Transportation Safety Board.
   ``An arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory
rest time that doesn't take into account circadian factors is
simply not 20th century,'' he said. ``We know that an hour of sleep
is not an hour of sleep, depending on when you take it. One of the
biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to
recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately.''
   The experts contend that schedules should consider the time of
departure, the number of time zones crossed and the direction of
travel. (The body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east
than east to west.)
   Another part of the problem is the plane itself. The modern
cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber. The lights are
dim. The seats are comfortable. The air rushes past with a soothing
hum.
   Planes are so automated that they quite literally fly
themselves. Except while landing and taking off, there is often
little for crew members to do. The newest planes don't even require
a flight engineer, so standard crew size is being reduced from
three members to two. Some pilots and sleep experts complain that
this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off.
   ``The fewer people in the cockpit, the fewer safeguards you
have,'' said Dr. Martin Moore-Ede of Harvard, a sleep expert at
Harvard Medical School. ``It's easier for two people to nod off
than three.''
   But Delmar Fadden, a Boeing administrator, asserts just the
opposite is likely: ``If there are only two in the cockpit, both
know that they can't rely on a third person, so they are more
attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to
allow themselves to go to sleep.''
   Fadden, who establishes design requirements for the Boeing 747
and 767, said, ``We can't do a lot about the fact that the crew
might be fatigued. What we try to do is make the airplane tolerant
of the crew's reaction.''
   This means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored,
drowsy, inattentive pilots. If something goes wrong, such as a
generator failure, the plane automatically compensates without
waiting for the crew to act.
   Fadden said some planes being built will monitor their crews.
Alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes. Such a lapse
of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse.
   Another possible solution, used by the British during the
Falkland Islands crisis, is a drug to help pilots sleep before
night flights. Bill Storm, a psychologist at Brooks Air Force Base
in San Antonio, Texas, said the U.S. military is experimenting with
the drug temazepam.
   All of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance
that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather, equipment
failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster.
   ``We run a very safe air transportation system,'' said Lauber.
``But we are pushing people harder. We know from anecdotal data
that people are not as alert as they should be. They are falling
asleep in some circumstances. I think it's appropriate that we
re-examine the way we approach these things.''

   Imagine this work week:
   Leave Los Angeles at 8:15 p.m. and fly 5{ hours to Honolulu.
Rest the second day, but leave late that night _ at 1 a.m., which
is 4 a.m. Los Angeles time _ for the 8{-hour flight to Auckland,
New Zealand, where you wait 90 minutes then fly three more hours to
Sydney, Australia. After a day's rest in Australia, you do the same
thing in reverse, landing back in Los Angeles seven days after you
left.
   Or consider this schedule:
   Leave Boston at 6:15 a.m., fly two hours to Cincinnati, leave an
hour later on a 4{-hour flight to Los Angeles. Twelve hours after
landing, you're back in the cockpit, flying all night to Cincinnati
and, after an hour on the ground, on to Newark, arriving back on
the East Coast 26 hours after you left.
   It is schedules like these, the first flown by United Airlines
crews, the second by Delta Airlines, that pilots say wear them
down, sometimes leaving them groggy and prone to mistakes.
   ``What we're doing with these schedules is taking human beings
and saying let's get the maximum out of them,'' said one United
captain interviewed by The Associated Press, who asked not to be
identified out of concern for his job. ``As a result we've got
crews who are in rough shape out there.''
   Yet another United captain who makes trans-Pacific flights said
his most recent six-day tour of duty went like this:
   10:15 a.m. _ Arrive Los Angeles International Airport for 11:35
jumbo jet trip to Tokyo. Go through paper work, check flight plans,
weather, fuel, passenger load.
   Flight promises to be particularly heavy, requiring unscheduled
fuel stop in Alaska. Several passengers fail to show, making extra
stop unnecessary, but threatened schedule change and a mixup
getting departure clearance mean plane is pushed away from the gate
40 minutes late.
   12:35 p.m. _ After starting the engines, taxiing out to runway,
going over checklist, plane takes off.
   After liftoff, ``we run a sterile cockpit until top of climb,''
the captain says. ``That means all business, no chitchat, no PA
announcements. We check the instruments, seeing that the systems
are running as we expect, and check the inertial navigation system
to make sure it is tracking with ground navigation aids.''
   The plane leaves the California coast north of San Francisco and
passes over the Aleutian Islands. From then on, the flight is
routine. The crew makes regular position checks, watches the
navigational instruments, listens to an emergency frequency, chats
with other planes and eats. (Crew meals are better than coach but
not as fancy as first class.)
   As plane approaches Tokyo about 10 hours after takeoff, there
are more checklists and instructions from air traffic controllers.
``You have to screw up your level of concentration, because
insidiously you often are not aware of your fatigue,'' the captain
says.
   2:48 p.m. Tokyo time, following day _ Plane lands at Narita
International Airport. Pilot's cockpit time between leaving the
terminal in Los Angeles and parking in Tokyo, ``block to block'' as
they say, is 11 hours and 33 minutes.
   The crew is on duty for 30 minutes more, finishing up paper
work. They clear customs and immigration and are picked up by a bus
for the 15-minute ride to a hotel.
   The captain stays up a couple of hours more, having dinner,
reading and unwinding. He finally goes to sleep at 8 p.m., which is
5 a.m. Los Angeles time. He sleeps five or six hours, wakes up well
before dawn. He has breakfast, reads and exercises. At noon, he
tries unsuccessfully to sleep again.
   5 p.m. _ Bus picks up crew for 6:30 departure for Seattle.
   Before this tour is over, the pilot flies back to Tokyo via
Anchorage, Alaska, then returns to Los Angeles. When he gets home,
he sleeps 13 hours straight.
   Such schedules are relatively common and uniformly grueling.
   The problem, say officials, is that to schedule the 18,500 daily
flights, to get people where they want when they want, to remain
competitive and cost-effective, some pilots must fly through the
night across multiple time zones then come back eight hours later
and do it again.
   Typically, each airline presents its monthly flights to both
human schedulers and computers programmed to consider the vagaries
of economics, fuel consumption, regulations, contracts and human
and equipment limits.
   Men and machines come up with possibilities that are
double-checked.
   ``We take a look at it based on the safety issues,'' said George
Hof, head of flight operations at American Airlines. ``The
computer, in optimizing the costs in crewing the series of flights,
will take a look at the duty time available and cram a lot of
flying into that.''
   Once approved, the crew lists are put up for bid. The pilots bid
for schedules based on their desirability and hourly pay rate.
Those who fly the bigger, faster planes get paid more. Pilot wages
range from about $70,000 a year to a top of $160,000.
   According to the Airline Pilots Association, the average pilot
is in the cockpit about 80 hours a month and spends another 80
hours on duty, preparing for flights or waiting for passengers to
load and unload.
   This total of 160 hours is crammed into an average of 16 days a
month.
   Management and pilots agree there is little way to avoid some of
the overnight, multiple time zone schedules that test pilots'
endurance.
   ``You're not going to work it all out,'' said Dick Stone, a
Delta captain and chairman of the pilots union's Human Performance
Committee. ``We work silly hours and that's just the way the
business is.''

   It's an entertainment season without
blockbusters, unless you count that earth-bustin' new show at
Universal Studios.
   But then again, tap-dancing bears, a dying swan and the holy
images of a golden empire also punctuate the fall lineup of arts
and live entertainment.
   As part of an ongoing $140 million expansion, the Universal
Studios tour in Los Angeles, which takes visitors to
behind-the-scenes glimpses of filmmaking, launches ``Earthquake:
The Big One,'' beginning Nov. 21. The experience will be housed in
a 22,000 square foot soundstage where the ground will shake, rattle
and roll.
   Tramways will collapse and tourists will be ``trapped'' amidst
falling telephone poles, walls, ``live'' cables, a train wreck and
60,000 gallons of rushing water. But not to worry: It's all show
biz and special effects.
   Dancing bears who move with the alacrity of humans are the stars
of the Moscow Circus, which launched a 15-city North American tour
in Toronto. Featuring trapeze artists and 17 tigers as well, it
concludes Jan. 1 in San Francisco.
   Another gift from the Soviet Union this season is prima
ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, who will perform Fokine's ``The Dying
Swan'' with the Martha Graham Dance Company, a role she has not
danced in New York in 18 years.
   And from Greece comes an exhibition of Byzantine icons and
frescoes, which opened at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore on
Aug. 21. It runs through Oct. 16. Icons, devotional images made in
tempera on gold-flecked wooden panels, represent the spirituality
of the Byzantine Empire (330 A.D. to 1453). The exhibit will be at
the Center for Fine Arts in Miami from November to January before
touring elsewhere in the United States through January, 1990.
   Here are highlights of other events taking place here and abroad
this fall:
   DANCE:
   The New York City Ballet performs at the New Tokyo Bay NK Hall
theater in Tokyo, Japan, from Sept. 15-25. The repertory includes
George Balanchine's ``Agon'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' and
Jerome Robbins' ``Afternoon of a Faun.''
   The company's winter season begins at the New York State Theater
on Nov. 21. ``The Nutcracker'' will be danced Dec. 1-31.
   The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater began a celebration of
its 30th anniversary with a seven-week tour of Europe beginning
Aug. 26 in Spain. The company will give 39 performances in 14

<HEAD>Autumn Brings Return of Social Commentary to the Screen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With youngsters back in school, satiated by the
usual overflow of mindless summer entertainment, the fall movie
season traditionally turns to more adult fare, particularly high
caliber dramas destined for Academy Award consideration.
   This season, social comment, which has not been in strong supply
in recent years, makes a return to the screen with such subjects as
armed hate groups, infanticide, political protest fugitives, as
well as another look at the Vietnam War.
   Already playing in the nation's theaters is ``Betrayed,'' a
drama starring Debra Winger and Tom Berenger about the right-wing
underground in the Midwest.
   At the other end of the political spectrum is Sidney Lumet's
``Running on Empty,'' with Christine Lahti, Judd Hirsch and River
Phoenix. The movie concerns a family of 1960s radicals who have
been living underground and on the run for 15 years.
   ``Bat 21,'' with Gene Hackman and Danny Glover takes another
hard look at the Vietnam War.
   ``The American movies of the 1930s and 1940s made a big impact
on me because of their social content,'' says Costa-Gavras, the
Greek-French director of ``Betrayed'' and other political films,
including ``Z'' and ``Missing.''
   ``When I first saw `The Grapes of Wrath,' it made an indelible
impression on me. I deplore the fact that Hollywood retreated into
a dream world in the last few decades. But I see hope for the
future. There are too many young and talented filmmakers who want
to comment on the world's ills.''
   Social commentary won't be the only significance of the autumnal
movie season. Following a record summer at the nation's box
offices, Hollywood anticipates a rousing fourth-quarter finish to
what may be its biggest box-office year.
   ``No Drought at the Box Office'' bannered the trade paper
Variety in predicting a record $1.65-billion theater gross for the
summer. With ```Crocodile' Dundee II,'' ``Coming to America'' and
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'' breaking the $100 million barrier and
``Big'' well on its way, chances are good that 1988 will top last
year's $4.25 billion.
   The 22-week Hollywood writers strike apparently will not affect
the supply of films to the world's theaters.
   ``There is an abundant supply of product,'' said Herb Steinberg,
spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers. ``The Christmas pictures are in the can, and films now
in production will carry into next year. And there are plenty of
scripts ready to be filmed.''
   Cheryl Rhoden of the Writers Guild of America acknowledged that
the strike ``slowed some projects down.'' But she said the effects
of the walkout on theatrical production are harder to measure than
television, where the fall season was decimated.
   Fall movie-goers may notice a few more rough edges than usual
because the numerous script revisions normally made in the course
of theatrical filming were not permitted during the lengthy walkout.
   Here's what else is on tap for the fall season:
   Having little success in comedies, Whoopi Goldberg returns to
drama with ``Clara's Heart,'' directed by Robert Mulligan (``To
Kill a Mockingbird''). Meryl Streep is accused of murdering her
baby at an Australian court trial in ``Guilty by Suspicion.'' Diane
Keaton returns to drama in ``The Good Mother,'' directed by Leonard
Nimoy (``Three Men and a Baby'').
   ``Criminal Law'' stars Kevin Bacon in a story about a serial
killer. Jeremy Irons plays twins in ``Dead Ringers'' with Genevieve
Bujold. Burt Lancaster plays a grandfather whose family visits him
in ``Rocket Gibraltar.''
   Clint Eastwood directed his homage to Charlie Parker in
``Bird,'' with Forest Whitaker (``Good Morning, Vietnam'') as the
legendary sax man. ``Imagine: John Lennon'' traces the late
Beatle's stormy life in rare footage from his estate.
   Hard to believe, but the musical will make a comeback _ sort of.
Gregory Hines will appear as a dancer seeking help from oldtimer
Sammy Davis Jr. in ``Tap.''
   ``Heartbreak Hotel'' is listed as a musical drama starring David
Keith and Tuesday Weld.
   Animation fans will be able to see two new features this fall:
Disney's ``Oliver and Company,'' a reworking of ``Oliver Twist''
with the voices of Bette Midler, Billy Joel and Huey Lewis; ``The
Land Before Time,'' a prehistoric family adventure from Steven
Spielberg and Don Bluth, who combined on ``An American Tale.''
   Since comedy is still king, there will be plenty of
laugh-seekers in the fall market. Peter O'Toole, Steve Gutenburg
and Darryl Hannah appear in a comedy-fantasy about a haunted
English mansion. ``Heart Break Dance,'' a comedy-drama about family
life in a New England town, marks Don Johnson's emergence in
feature films. He stars with Susan Sarandon and Jeff Daniels.
   ``The Accidental Tourist'' reunites the crew of ``Body Heat'' _
William Hurt, Kathleen Turner and writer-director Lawrence Kasdan _
in a comedy about a travel writer and a dog trainer. Rebecca
deMornay plays an FBI trainee who goofs up in ``Feds.'' Sally Field
and Tom Hanks are would-be standup comics in ``Punchline.''
   Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley play Sherlock Holmes and Dr.
Watson for laughs in ``Without a Clue.'' In ``Moon Over Parador,''
Richard Dreyfuss appears as an actor who impersonates a Caribbean
dictator.
   Want some adventure? ``Gorillas in the Mist'' features Sigourney
Weaver as the ill-fated student of ape behavior, Dian Fossey. And
Don Ameche and friends are back in ``Cocoon: The Return.''
   In the action line, Mel Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt
Russell appear in the drug-war ``To Kill a Sunrise.''
   ``The Beast,'' with Jason Patrick, concerns a Soviet tank crew
in Afganistan. In ``Last Rites,'' Tom Berenger portrays a Catholic
priest who protects a girl marked for death by the Mafia. ``Alien
Nation'' casts James Caan, Mandy Patinkin and Terence Stamp in a
sci-fi cop thriller.
   All these films come from the eight major releasing companies.
Many others will be emanating from the ever-growing independent
companies.

<TEXT>
   Right across the Hudson River begins a world of
theater that Broadway rarely sees.
   For every ``Crimes of the Heart,'' ``'night, Mother,'' ``Big
River'' or ``Roza,'' there are scores of new plays, musicals and
revivals that rarely travel to New York.
   The following is a highly selective and subjective list of 10
promising theater productions that audiences beyond the Great White
Way will see during the 1988-89 theater season. A few of them might
make it to New York, but the name of the game is to provide lively
local theater rather than ready-made exports to Broadway. The
listings are in order of opening dates.
   1. ``The Grapes of Wrath''
   Steppenwolf Theater Company, the superstar of Chicago theater
troupes, has come up with a version of John Steinbeck's memorable
novel of the Depression. Frank Galati has adapted the book for the
stage and also directs. The cast includes such Steppenwolf regulars
as Gary Sinise and Terry Kinney as well as guest artist Lois Smith.
Performances: Sept. 18 through Oct. 30.
   2. ``The Habitation of Dragons''
   The Pittsburgh Public Theater has snared the world premiere of
the latest work by Horton Foote, playwright and screewriter of suchves
of Texas families in such plays as ``The Widow Claire'' and
``Lily Dale.'' His latest effort is also set in the Lone Star State
and deals with loss, divided loyalities and forgiveness.
Performances are Sept. 20 through Oct. 23.
   3. ``Waiting for Godot''
   If you can't get tickets to the Robin Williams-Steve Martin
version of Samuel Beckett's absurdist comedy opening this fall at
Lincoln Center in New York, then try Denver. In its 400-seat Space
theater, the Denver Center Theater Company has come up with a
female version of ``Godot,'' starring Ann Guilbert and Sandra Ellis
Lafferty. Performances begin Sept. 26, and the production runs
through Nov. 5.
   4. ``On the Waterfront''
   Another great novel, this time by Budd Schulberg, will be put on
stage by the Cleveland Play House, now under the supervision of a
new artistic director, Josephine Abady. Miss Abady will also direct
the play which Schulberg and Stan Silverman have adapted for stage.
Grant Show, best known from the television soap opera ``Ryan's
Hope,'' plays Terry Malloy, the young ex-prizefighter who takes a
stand against a corrupt waterfront union. Performances: Oct. 18
through Nov. 20.
   5. ``Stone Wedding''
   Another world premiere, this time at the Los Angeles Theater
Center, an enterprising theater complex in the city's downtown
area. The play by Milcha Sanchez-Scott is set in a small town in
the American Southwest where black magic and supernatural forces
collide. ``Stone Wedding'' was commissioned by the center's Latino
Theater Lab. Performances: Nov. 23 thorugh Jan. 22, 1989.
   6. ``Pravda''
   Anthony Hopkins scored a huge personal success two years ago in
England in this savage satire by Howard Brenton and David Haire. He
offered a scathing portrait of a South African press baron who
rules London's Fleet Street. Now the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis
will present the play's American premiere. No word yet on who will
play Hopkins' role in Minnesota. Performances: Jan. 7, 1989 through
Feb. 5, 1989.
   7. ``Alfred Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe''
   The relationship between two of this century's greatest artists
_ photographer Alfred Stieglitz and painter Georgia O'Keeffe _ is
explored in a play by Lanie Robertson, author of ``Lady Day at
Emerson's Bar and Grill,'' which examined the life of Billie
Holiday. Robertson's new play will be done at San Diego's Old Globe
Theater. Performances: Jan. 7, 1989 through Feb. 19, 1989.
   8. ``Golden Boy''
   In 1964, Sammy Davis starred on Broadway in a musical version of
Clifford Odets' play about a boxer and his conflicts with fame and
fortune. The unappreciated score is one of the best by Charles
Strouse and Lee Adams, the men behind the music for ``Bye Bye
Birdie.'' Now ``Golden Boy'' will be revived with a reworked book
by Leslie Lee. No word yet on who will play the leading role, but
the musical will be done at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Coconut
Grove, Fla. Performances: Jan. 17, 1989 through Feb. 12, 1989.
   9. ``Accomplice''
   Rupert Holmes scored on Broadway with his musical version of
Charles Dickens' ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood.'' Now he has written
what is being billed as ``a tantalizing thriller.'' The director is
Art Wolff. The play will be done at the newly revitalized Pasadena
Playhouse in California. Performances: Jan. 30, 1989 through March
1, 1989.
   10. ``Peer Gynt''
   Calling all Ibsen groupies to Connecticut. The Hartford Stage
Company plans a two-part, six-hour version of the playwright's
poetic parable of redemption through love. Richard Thomas stars as
Ibsen's egocentric hero. The director is Mark Lamos, the theater's
artistic director. The two men worked together last season at
Hartford on an imaginative version of ``Hamlet.'' The new Ibsen
translation is by Gerry Bamman and Irene Berman. Performances:
March 30, 1989 through May 20, 1989.

  There's a face-off this fall between a short,
bug-eyed alien and a pretty blonde pining for her prince.
   ``E.T. The Extraterrestrial'' and Walt Disney's ``Cinderella''
are among the big attractions for home video fans this season, and
the good news is they will retail for only $24.95 and $26.99,
respectively.
   ``E.T.,'' the biggest grosser of all time, has made more than
$228 million in film rentals, and has an estimated worldwide box
office of nearly $500 million. It is being released by MCA Home
Video.
   The movie, produced by Steven Spielberg, tells the story of an
endearing little alien from another world who becomes marooned on
Earth. It is befriended and given sanctuary by children who protect
it from government agents, and who help E.T. return home.
   Walt Disney's ``Cinderella'' earned close to $33 million last
year when it was re-released to movie houses. Disney Home Video
hopes the beautifully animated film will soar past sales figures
for its best-selling ``Lady and the Tramp'' video, which has sold
3.2 million copies. Released in 1950, the 75-minute feature was
nominated for two Academy Awards, including best song for ``Bibbidy
Bobbidi Boo.''
   Also out this fall from Orion Home Video is a series of
contemporary foreign film classics, including Claude Berri's
award-winning ``Jean de Florette,'' which won four British
``Oscars'' including best film, and its sequel ``Manon of the

Bands,'' a wonderful collection of vintage 1940s and '50s film
footage of such artists as Duke Ellington, Nat ``King'' Cole, Tommy
Dorsey, Charlie Barnet, Gene Krupa and Billie Holiday.
   
   The two-volume package will be available on laser videodisc with
a suggested retail price of $34.98 each.

   Free of the colonial yoke for three decades, the
five Arab nations of North Africa known as the ``Maghreb'' still
rely heavily on foreigners to keep them going and the democracy
many North Africans fought for still eludes them. But now the five
are seeking solutions in unity.

<TEXT>
   Soaring 300 feet into the air on the
heights overlooking Algiers is a monument to the heroes of the
National Liberation Struggle. The three intertwining concrete
leaves are of Polish design and Canadian execution.
   In neighboring Morocco, a French engineering company is building
the world's largest mosque.
   In Tunisia, a Dutch company is draining the evil-smelling lake
between the capital and its wealthy suburbs.
   In Mauritania, French engineers operate the iron mines and the
railroad providing the country's main source of income.
   In Libya, foreigners operate the oil fields and work at many
other jobs in the country.
   The first three decades of independence have left a vague legacy
of disappointment in the five North African Arab countries known as
the ``Maghreb'' _ the Arab West _ and a reliance on foreigners to
do the important work remains widespread.
   No one dares question the wisdom of going it alone _ that would
put in doubt the very core of their existence. But citizens in the
five Maghreb countries are asking themselves whether their leaders
have gone the right way about getting the most out of their
sovereignty.
   This public discussion has provided the context for the current
debate on unity.
   Not one of the five countries can be described as democratic.
With the exception of Morocco, none has had a genuinely free
election since the end of what was mainly French colonial rule.
   Algeria, which became known as the Democratic People's Republic
after winning its independence war against the French in 1962, is
still recovering from the 13-year dictatorship of Col. Houari
Boumedienne, who died in 1978. His successor, Chadli Bendjedid, is
trying to remove the ``old guard'' without rocking the boat.
   Tunisia shook off the 32-year dictatorship of its ``president
for life,'' Habib Bourguiba, removed from office on grounds of
senility in 1987, only to fall into a more moderate form of
autocratic rule under Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
   Morocco has a limited form of democracy, but King Hassan II is
the supreme arbiter of all political events. No one rules but the
king.
   Libya is known as the ``Jamahiriya'' or republic. Col. Moammar
Gadhafi is its heaven-sent ruler and no one dares oppose him.
Mauritania has plunged from one military coup into another.
   With such a legacy, it is surprising that the Maghreb countries
have not seen more violence and bloodshed than they have.
   They have set the scene for several air hijackings, American
planes bombed Libyan cities to ``punish'' Gadhafi, and Israeli
aircraft bombed the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation
Organization in Tunis. The PLO's No. 2 man, Abu Jihad, was killed
in his Tunis home by assassins believed to have come from Israel.
   Islam remains the common link for the region. From Tobruk in
eastern Libya to Dakhla in the Western Sahara, muezzin can be heard
calling the faithful to prayer, and most work stops throughout the
holy month of Ramadan.
   Only in Tunisia did Bourguiba once try to stop the Ramadan fast,
publicly drinking orange juice at midday in a much-publicized
gesture of defiance.
   The gesture failed, and Tunisia today is as religious-minded as
ever. With the exception of Morocco, whose king claims direct
descent from the Prophet Mohammed, Islamic fundamentalism is on the
upsurge everywhere.
   In Algeria, the authorities tried to meet this revivalism with a
revolutionary form of socialism. Hard-line officials still try to
keep these principles alive, but few Algerians really believe they
will bring salvation.
   Throughout the region unemployment, as high as 40 percent in
urban centers, is the most pressing problem. Health and education
are close behind. Inflation is rearing its head. No one seems to
have any remedy. The population is soaring by nearly 4 percent a
year, the underlying cause of most other problems.
   Despite official protestations to the contrary, women are
subjected to such discriminatory practices as polygamy, denial of
inheritance rights and unilateral divorce. Only the educated
minority among the women think of protest.
   With the exception of a narrow fertile coastal strip, most of
the land is desert. About 12,000 years ago, it was a fertile region
of fruit trees and tropical animals, as testified by prehistoric
rock paintings. All this has gone. The Sahara moves steadily
outward by hundreds of square miles a year.

<TEXT>
   With the 19th century collapse of the Turkish Empire, most of
the Maghreb became a French preserve. Only Libya, then a gathering
of impoverished tribes, fell to Italy.
   The discovery of major oil deposits throughout the region made
all the difference.
   Morocco alone had no oil. But it did have massive deposits of
phosphates, the natural chemical needed for fertilizers. Morocco
has nearly one-fourth of all the world's known deposits of
phosphates, without counting the Western Sahara.
   This former Spanish colony, which continues the Moroccan
coastline 1,600 miles to the southwest, was intended mainly as an
outer defense for the Canary Islands. Most of it was left as a
wilderness. Under Moroccan pressure, Spain abandoned the territory
in 1975, and it ultimately fell to Morocco.
   For the past 13 years, a forgotten war has raged between the
Moroccan army and the Algerian-backed Polisario movement seeking
independence for the Western Sahara. But the guerrillas have made
little headway.
   The Moroccans assembled superior firepower and a 1,500-mile wall
that barred access to the territory. The guerrillas proved unable
to breach the wall in strength or to prevent its extension.
   Mauritania, which at first joined with Morocco in suppressing
the guerrillas and then flipped to the opposite side, ended up on
neither side.
   As a result of these moves, the Polisario was gradually
eliminated from the struggle. King Hassan accepted a U.N. proposal
for a controlled international referendum to settle the territory's
future. Unless the Polisario finds some way to block it, the
referendum is likely to take place some time in 1989. It is
generally expected to lead to a Moroccan victory.
   In his vigorous campaign for the Moroccan cause, Hassan forged a
treaty of union with Libya. The treaty stopped Libyan support to
the Polisario but it seriously upset Morocco's American friends.
   When the Polisario had been defeated, the treaty was no longer
needed and Hassan used the first pretext to cancel it.
   Meanwhile, Gadhafi made a series of ill-fated attempts to merge
with his neighbors. They all ended in failure. Everyone likes
Gadhafi's money, but no one wants to be seen selling his
independence to the highest bidder.
   At the same time, the North African leaders bowed to widespread
public pressure and began a serious attempt to find some kind of
unity. The five met in Algiers in June and agreed to work toward a
North African confederation.
   Tunisia and Libya hurriedly restored the diplomatic relations
they had broken over Libya's expulsion of more than 30,000 Tunisian
workers three years earlier. Algeria and Morocco agreed to ignore
Polisario protests and did likewise.
   Hassan arrived in Algiers in a chartered car ferry, and when
Bendjedid came to meet him, the two men fell into each other's
arms. All present felt they saw history in the making.
   Gadhafi again was the odd man out. He played the clown, walking
up and down on the terrace outside the meeting room, declaring the
summit was a ``gathering of has-beens.''
   It took all the diplomatic skill of President Ben Ali of Tunisia
and Secretary-General Chedli Klibi of the Arab League to persuade
Gadhafi to join the meeting.
   Ultimately, they worked out a plan for a greater Maghreb
confederation. It is only on paper, so far, and all the real work
remains to be done.
   But Hassan had learned at first-hand about the advantages of the
European Economic Community, which turned down Morocco's request to
join. He is a fervent advocate of creating a similar community in
North Africa. His arguments won the day.
   The summit instructed the bureaucrats to work out the details.
It remains to be seen how far they will succeed.

   Here are some facts and figures on the Maghreb in North Africa:
   THE COUNTRIES AND THE LAND _ Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya
and Mauritania make up the Maghreb, or the Arab West, in North
Africa. They cover about 2,341,000 square miles, one-fifth of the
African continent. This is about two-thirds the area of the
continental United States.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The total population is about 68 million and 99
percent are Moslems. Virtually all speak one of several dialects of
Arabic. Most are descendants of the Berber tribes who were the
original inhabitants before the arrival of the Arabs. Most of the
people are farmers and herders. Most of the population is
concentrated around the main cities, Casablanca, Marrakech,
Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Tunis and Tripoli.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Algeria, Libya and Tunisia have economies based on
exports of oil and gas. Tunisia also has a substantial income from
tourism and from the export of wine and citrus fruit. Tourism, wine
and citrus fruit also are important in Morocco, but the largest
earner of foreign currency is the export of phosphates, worth about
$400 million in 1986. Mauritania mines about 10 million tons of
iron ore annually at the Zouerate mines, and catches 35,000 tons of
fish _ one-tenth of the total in Mauritanian waters. Currencies and
their equivalents in U.S. money: Algerian dinar (17 cents),
Moroccan dirham (13 cents), Tunisian dinar ($1.30), Libyan dinar
(30 cents), Mauritanian ouguiya (2 cents).

   HISTORY _ Christianized under the Roman Empire, the area became
part of the Islamic world in the eighth century. In the 19th
century, it came under French, Spanish and Italian colonization. On
independence after World War II, the area came mostly under
totalitarian or absolutist regimes. Morocco and Algeria fought a
brief border war in 1963, followed by a long quarrel over the
Western Sahara. Tunisia and Libya quarrelled over citizens' rights
and over oil prospecting in the Mediterranean. Algeria and Libya
have a long-pending territorial dispute. In May, they began work on
a framework for a Confederation.

   The forgotten war that has been raging
across the barren wilderness of northwestern Africa may soon draw
to a close as the two sides _ Morocco and the Marxist Polisario
Front _ are forced into a compromise over the territory of Western
Sahara.
   The framework for the compromise is likely to be suggested by
the United Nations. It could be a long way from the extreme demands
made by the Polisario Front.
   The main reason for the change will be the Algerian government's
disillusionment with the Polisario fighters, whose 13 years of
guerrilla war has not brought them control of a single Saharan city.
   A referendum is to determine the wishes of the original
inhabitants of the disputed territory, whether they now are in the
Moroccan-held cities or in the Polisario-run camps in Algeria.
   Everything lies in the question to be put in the referendum:
Will the estimated 100,000 inhabitants and their adult children be
asked simply whether they want independence, or will they be asked
to endorse the Polisario as their ``sole legitimate
representative?''
   Endorsement of the Polisario would give the guerrilla movement
the right to determine the territory's future, even if trson, I feel a
lot vented toward me by other
whites,'' he said.
   Cleve McDowell, a top official with the state branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said
there had been ``several problems in that area. There is blatant
hostility in that area of the state that does not exist elsewhere.''
   Macon is a town of 2,400 people in east-central Mississippi.
   ``I'm extremely disappointed, but not shocked,'' McDowell said.
``I think it was an action by a person with a low mentality who
thought he was responding to what the white public wanted.''
   The church's adult members, who are mostly college-educated
professionals, have been active in working with the poor.
   ``Our main interest is not just going to church on Sunday. Our
goals are to cater to the needs of the community, but we target
those people in the lower socioeconomic condition,'' Hatcher said.

   Lawyers for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. have
moved quickly to seek access to the government's evidence for its
fraud case against the Wall Street firm. But people familiar with
the firm's strategy predicted prosecutors could mark time until the
U.S. attorney's office finishes its criminal probe.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
contended Thursday that the civil charges filed by the Securities
and Exchange Commission contained no surprises.
   Under civil law rules for pretrial fact-gathering, Drexel
theoretically now has the right to see the SEC's evidence. But the
U.S. attorney, who has been conducting a grand jury inquiry
paralleling the SEC probe, could intervene to halt the discovery
process if he thought it would compromise his effort.

on textile, apparel and shoe imports, possibly setting up a trade
confrontation with the Reagan administration on the eve of the
November elections.
   The Senate continued debate Thursday on the bill, which would
freeze this year's textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels and
allow 1 percent annual growth thereafter. It is similar to a bill
President Reagan vetoed in 1985.
   Proponents said the bill would save jobs, but retailers said
limiting imports would reduce consumers' choices and might boost

   The Securities and Exchange Commission's
long-awaited civil suit against junk bond pioneer Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. has had little effect on the market for the
high-yield, high-risk securities.
   Late Thursday, junk bond prices in the secondary market were
little changed from Wednesday. Many analysts predicted few future
price fluctuations would result from the suit filed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   ``I think it was anticipated that this (suit) was going to take
place, and when it actually happened ... it was a bit of a
non-event,'' said Anthony Naylor, a corporate bond analyst at the
securities firm Rodman & Renshaw Inc. The federal civil complaint
filed Wednesday charged Drexel, its junk-bond chief, Michael
Milken, and others with securities violations ranging from insider
trading to falsifying records as part of a secret arrangement with
former speculator Ivan F. Boesky.
   The government acknowledged more than a year ago that it was
investigating Drexel and its junk bond operations, which have been
used to finance some of the biggest corporate takeovers of the
1980s. The probe began after Boesky was charged in the nation's
biggest insider-trading scheme.
   There also has been widespread speculation that the U.S.
attorney's office, which is conducting a parallel investigation of
Drexel, would file criminal charges, perhaps as early as next month.
   ``It's unlikely those chrages would have any effect on the
market,'' said Marshall B. Front, a partner at the Stein Roe &
Farnham, which manages a $100 million junk bond mutual fund. ``None
of my clients have expressed any concern.''
   Milken pioneered the use of junk securities in the late 1970s as
a way of providing capital to a vast majority of companies that
otherwise had limited access to public bond markets because their
credit ratings were too low.
   The only way of raising money for many of those companies had
been through stock sales or loans from banks and insurance
companies, which generally carried numerous restrictions and higher
interest rates.
   Junk bonds generally pay about four percentage points higher
interest than comparable U.S. Treasury securities, essentially
giving investors a higher return to compensate for the higher risk
of default.
   The bonds have since become a staple for many small- and
medium-size companies looking for financing and for institutional
investors such as pension funds and savings associations seeking
income.
   Junk bonds also have been a major financing weapon for corporate
raiders seeking to raise millions or billions of dollars for
hostile takeovers.
   The lucrative market initially was almost solely dominated by
Drexel, but in recent years attracted a host of more traditional
Wall Street firms. Drexel's market share has eroded to about 50
percent of the $17 billion in underwritings so far in 1988.
   ``The market has grown so large it transcends the act of any
individual brokerage firm or underwriter,'' said Robert Waill, a
managing director at the securities firm L.F. Rothschild & Co.
``That's why the SEC charges (against Drexel) are having no effect
on the market.''
   Still, some bond analysts said the Drexel charges might prompt
some companies to put off future issues until the market has time
to digest the consequences of the suit. About 20 deals, valued at
between $6 billion and $8 billion, could be affected, estimated
Gene Wong, a managing director for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Wong said Drexel-underwritten issues of highly leveraged,
volatile companies might also be hurt.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is getting support
from Wickes Cos. Inc., a California-based company that the
government says was a victim of insider trading by Drexel.
   Wickes said Thursday it did not expect civil insider trading and
fraud charges against Drexel to have any effect on a proposed
leveraged buyout that depends $423 million in financing through an
issue of junk bonds by Drexel.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Wednesday that
Drexel acted behind Wickes' back in 1986 while Wickes was trying
unsuccessfully to take over National Gypsum Co. The charge was part
of a broader civil suit brought by the SEC accusing Drexel and
others of numerous securities frauds.
   ``Obviously if the charges are ultimately proven, this would be
distressing,'' said Wickes spokesman Michael Sitrick.
   ``However, based on our current knowledge of the situation we
would not anticipate that the filing of this complaint will have
any negative impact on our relationship with Drexel or any of its
people with whom we work,'' Sitrick said.
   Wickes, a building-supplies retailing company based in Santa
Monica, Calif., on Aug. 21 announced plans for a management-led
buyout that values the company at about $600 million.
   Drexel is the dealer-manager and investment banker on the
transaction, which is being held open until Oct. 20 while Bear,
Stearns & Co. searches for bidders that might be willing to offer
more than the management-led group.
   The SEC charged that Drexel, Michael Milken, who is head of its
junk-bond business, and his brother Lowell Milken secretly used the
organization of speculator Ivan Boesky to improperly sell Wickes
common stock for Drexel's benefit.
   The government also alleged that Drexel, Michael Milken and
Milken associate Cary Maultasch used Boesky's organization to buy
stock in National Gypsum ``in breach of fiduciary duties owed ...
to Wickes.''
   Drexel made about $6.7 million off the illicit purchases while
being paid about $1 million for its services by Wickes, the SEC
said.
   Even though Wickes' bid for National Gypsum failed, the episode
was not a loss because Wickes came away with a profit of $3 million
after selling its shares back at a higher price than it paid for
them.
   Maxxam Industries Inc. of Los Angeles, which the SEC said also
was cheated by Drexel, declined comment Thursday on the
allegations. The SEC said Drexel used the Boesky organization to
buy for Drexel the stock of Pacific Lumber Co., which was the
target of a Maxxam tender offer in 1985.
   The complaint says Drexel received more than $22 million in fees
from Maxxam for services rendered in connection with its
acquisition of Pacific Lumber.
   Drexel was supported Wednesday by Triangle Industries Inc.,
which has floated about $1.8 billion in junk bonds through Drexel
for various deals over the past five years.
   Drexel's dealings with Triangle were not named in the SEC
complaint.
   ``We're standing behind Drexel at this point, certainly. We do
not intend to stop doing business with a firm on the basis of an
SEC complaint, especially one we've had such a long and fruitful
relationship with,'' said Triangle spokesman Mark Dorsett.

   A proposed law to further limit imports of
textiles, apparel and shoes also will lead to increased costs and
tighter supplies for the nation's retailers _ and higher prices for
consumers, storeowners say.
   The bill now before the Senate ``opens up a lot of problems,''
said David Jackson, a spokesman for the apparel retailer Gap Inc.
   Under the bill, this year's textile and apparel imports would be
frozen at 1987 levels and growth would be limited to 1 percent
annually in succeeding years.
   That would create what the retail industry calls sourcing
problems: stores will have a harder time obtaining merchandise.
   ``It opens up a whole parade of horribles for us,'' said Jackson.
   Rob Longendyke, a spokesman for Spiegel Inc., the catalog
retailer that also owns the apparel retailers Eddie Bauer and
Honeybee, agreed. ``The first effect would be to send us and other
companies scrambling to find what sources we can onshore that can
produce the merchandise we need.''
   ``The infrastructure for the textile industry does not exist in
this country anymore,'' Longendyke said. ``But there are some small
resources and the first thing that would happen is everyone would
go scrambling after those small resources.''
   ``In some cases, the consumer says he wants a particular kind of
sweater, weave or fabric, but we may not be able to find any kind
of sources'' to supply them, Jackson said.
   Consumers may find some garments, which now are heavily
imported, hard to find and much more expensive. Retailers said the
cost of many other apparel items likewise would be affected if the
bill passed and was signed into law by President Reagan.
   The bill ``most definitely will have a serious effect on prices,
both in (wholesale) costs of goods as well as the retail price,''
said Jackson.
   Higher prices would put retailers between a rock and a hard
place. Industry watchers say one reason for sluggish apparel sales
has been ``sticker shock,'' consumer rebellion against higher
clothing prices.
   Some manufacturers and stores already have absorbed some of the
higher costs for clothes, but would be unable to do so if the bill
became law.
   Retailers could hold the line on prices, Longendyke said, but it
would mean compromising on quality. For example, retailers could
use more domestic wool rather than Australian wool, which is
considered the highest quality, he said.
   Wall Street analysts differed over how much of an impact the
bill might have. Imports to some extent already have been slowed in
recent years by the rise of the dollar, which makes them more
expensive.
   ``It would probably drive up prices to some extent,'' said
Eileen Gormley, an analyst who follows the textile and apparel
industries for Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. She said some
clothing categories would be affected more than others.
   Jay Meltzer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co., doubted the bill
would have a major effect on the apparel industry.
   ``Imports are down this year vs. a year ago to date and will
surely be down for the year,'' he said. ``There's really not much
indication that they're going to go soaring next year, so a 1
percent-a-year growth limit would have no effect on present
conditions for some time.''
   Meltzer predicted the competitiveness of the apparel industry
would keep prices in line.
   Some retailers already have taken steps that would blunt the
impact of the bill's enactment.
   ``We have been busily going about trying to develop textile
resources onshore,'' said Longendyke.
   Whether the bill ever will become law is uncertain. Reagan
vetoed a similar measure three years ago and the administration is
suggesting the same fate may await the latest version.
   U.S. textile and apparel manufacturers have sought import limits
since a wave of Asian textile and apparel imports jolted the
industry in the early 1980s.
   The companies and labor unions say restrictions are needed to
salvage jobs in an industry whose existence they claim is
threatened by foreign competition.
   Retailers say the apparel industry does not need the bill.
   Al Dietzel, a spokesman for the apparel retailer Limited Inc.,
said, ``The textile and apparel industry probably has the highest
rate of employment and they are working at the highest level of
capacity of any industry in the U.S.''

   Oldsmobile is setting its marketing
sights on younger consumers for the coming automobile model year,
with an advertising campaign saying, ``This is not your father's
Oldsmobile.''
   The General Motors Corp. division introduced its 1989 cars at a
news conference Thursday, with executives constantly pointing to
the 35- to 45-year-old consumer as being in the bull's eye of Olds'
marketing target.
   In the past, said Warren Christell, Oldsmobile's general
marketing manager, the average Oldsmobile buyer has been about 50
years old.
   To introduce the '89 models to the public, Oldsmobile on
Thursday previewed a series of television ads to begin running
during the Summer Olympics, which begin next week in Seoul, South
Korea.
   Among the people in the advertisements are Deborah Moore and her

and her father, William Shatner, who starred in the original ``Star
Trek'' television series and motion pictures; and Jay Carpenter,
son of former astronaut Scott Carpenter.
   In each of the ads, a narrator says, ``This is not your father's
Oldsmobile.''
   ``We want young and old alike to identify with Oldsmbile,'' said
Oldsmobile General Manager Williams Lane.
   ``We think our products are ahead of our image,'' Christell
said. ``We haven't done a good job of telling people about it.
...We think our (advertising) campaigns were on (target for)
strategy .. but were weren't communicating with the consumer.''
   Along with expanding the target market for 1989, Oldsmobile
executives stressed the company's focus on new design and advanced
technology.
   One of the technical innovations to be introduced in a limited
number of 1989 models later in the model year is a ``head up
display,'' which projects a digital speedometer, turn signal
indicators, low-fuel warning and high-beam indicator onto the
windshield. A driver does not have to look away from the road to
get the information.
   Olds executives said the display system would be offered as an
option on some 1989 Cutlass Supremes.
   However, Larry Lyons, general engineering and planning manager,
said the company doesn't plan to expand the system quickly into
other cars.
   ``We are purposely going slow on that,'' he said.
   Another new bit of electronics coming out with some of the '89
Oldsmobiles is a color television screen in the dashboard which
will display a variety of functions, such as heating and stereo
controls and a compass.
   That device will be available as an option in Toronados and
Trofeos.

<HEAD>Face of the Bard to Decorate Bank Cash Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To deposit, or not to deposit; that is the
question.
   Starting next week, British banking customers may have a reason
to wax dramatic, as they start using a new series of cash machine
cards bearing pictures of William Shakespeare.
   Starting Monday, the face of Shakespeare _ portrayed in a
hologram that smiles when tilted _ will grace the cash dispenser
cards of 33 of Britain's savings and loan societies and banks.
   Jim Parsons, an official of the association of banks that
monitors money clearing systems, said Wednesday that the ``Bard
Cards'' will be available to all customers of its 33 members by
1990.
   The card can be used to guarantee checks and withdraw money from
cash machines.
   Parsons said he came up with the idea of using Shakespeare's
face after the European Economic Community's ``Eurocheque''
check-guarantee cards began using a hologram of Beethoven.
   ``I thought we should stay with the arts, so for the U.K., why
not Shakespeare?'' he said. ``I had no difficulty in persuading my
colleagues to accept the idea.''
   Asked if there had been any criticism of using such a renowned
literary figure for financial purposes, Parsons said, ``No
difficulties. ...Shakespeare was not cut off from the literary
world. I'm sure if Shakespeare were here today he would not have
had any objections to this.''

   Boeing Co. announced orders for five 767
passenger jets for at least $421 million on Thursday, boosting the
company's total jetliner orders for the year to more than $21
billion.
   Statements issued by Boeing said four 767-300 extended-range
aircraft were ordered by Gulf Air, the national carrier of Bahrain,
Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, for delivery in April,
May and June.
   The Greek national airline Olympic Airways ordered three
767-200s for delivery starting in early 1990 and took options on
three others, Boeing stated.
   Prices of the planes were not disclosed. The 767-300ER costs $67
million to $74 million, while the 767-200 costs $51 million to $60
million, said David Jimenez of Boeing.
   The latest orders boosted the total for the 767, a wide-bodied
twinjet, to 307 planes from 35 buyers.

<BYLINE>Jury Selection Starts, Four More Utilities Sidelined
^By JIM KLAHN
^Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-eight prospective jurors have been
selected in a giant fraud lawsuit over the default on bonds sold to
build two Washington Public Power Supply System nuclear power
plants.
   U.S. District Judge William Browning said he expected to have a
full panel of 20 jurors by the end of today.
   Meanwhile, four small utilities were being sidelined Thursday in
an effort to ease confusion in the complicated case.
   Browning questioned jurors en masse before trimming the number
to 38 Thursday. With time off early next week for a Jewish holiday
and primary elections, opening arguments were expected on Wednesday
and Thursday.
   Dismissal of a couple of jurors indicated how far-reaching the
Washington Public Power Supply fraud case is. One woman was let go
because she said her husband's retirement fund might include supply
system bonds.
   The civil case, one of the largest in the history of American
law, revolves around the default in 1983 by WPPSS on $2.25 billion
on bonds sold to finance construction on two nuclear power plants
in Washington state.
   Settlements have removed most of the original 100-plus
defendants sued by bond buyers, and plaintiff attorneys on Thursday
said four small utilities were being removed in a table-clearing
move that will make the trial easier to understand for jurors.
   Attorney Mel Weiss of New York, an attorney for class action
plaintiffs, said the four utilities are Central Oregon Cooprative
in Oregon, and Steilacoom Municipal, Alder Mutual and Mason Public
Utility District No. 1 of Washington. Formal announcement was
expected early next week.
   Weiss said agreements included a settlement with the
15,000-customer Central Oregon utility. The other three, with just
6,000 customers among them, were severed from the lawsuit with
agreement of the plaintiff attorneys.
   Removal of the four leaves 17 utilities among defendants, and
all 17 are members of the WPPSS board of directors.
   Six other members of the WPPSS board, including Seattle City
Light, have already settled with plaintiff bondholders and class
action plaintiffs.
   Generally it has cost WPPSS board members more to settle than
the non-WPPSS members that were among the 88 utilities contracting
with the supply system to build the two nuclear plants. However,
insurance money accounted for much of the settlements made by the
six WPPSS members off the hook in the lawsuit. The remaining 17
reportedly have little insurance money available, and they had
contracted for about two-thirds of the output of the two nuclear
power plants.
   Weiss said leaving just WPPSS member utilities at the
defendants' table would be less confusing to jurors. While the
Steilacoom, Alder and Mason utilities were severed from the case,
it did not remove them as defendants and they presumably still
could face legal action by plaintiffs, or could figure in a
settlement.
   Other defendants include the construction engineering firms of
United Engineers and Ebasco, and the financial advisory firm Blyth
Eastman.
   While warning that trial could last for ``several months,''
Judge William Browning told jurors he would do what he could to
accommodate those selected as jurors, including maximum payment of
$35 per day, parking assignments and accommodations in town for
people from beyond the metropolitan area.
   The trial had originally been expected to take eight months to
two years, but settlements have cut that time to one year at most.
   Browning told jurors they would serve Monday through Thursday
most weeks, but because they might have to work an occasional
Friday, he would pay them for five days a week.
   He also said the government would pay as much as $72 a day for
jurors outside the Tucson area who would have to move to town for
the duration of trial.
   Though 20 will be selected for trial, only some of those will be
called upon to render a verdict. A minimum of six is required in a
federal civil suit. Browning also said court would not be held for
most of the month of December and for a month next summer, if the
trial is still in session.

<HEAD>Businesses Plan 11.6 Percent Increase In Capital Spending</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 3 grafs on Producer Price Index for August; picks
up 2nd graf pvs, The Commerce ....</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Wholesale price inflation rose 0.6 percent in August, a rate
that would amount to 6.9 percent if it continued for 12 straight
months, the government said today.
   Energy prices rose at their steepest clip since April, 2.2
percent, but food costs posted a moderate 0.4 percent rise in spite
of the drought.
   The August figures confirmed that inflation is running well
ahead of 1987's pace, when wholesale prices rose 2.2 percent.
   There was a sign of business confidence on Thursday, when the
government said U.S. companies plan to increase their spending on
plant and equipment by 11.6 percent this year compared to 1987.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that a survey indicated
businesses plan to spend $429.4 billion, after adjusting for
inflation, topping the previous high of $391.6 billion set in 1985.
   Elsewhere, activity was quiet Thursday in the financial markets.
   Stock prices were little changed, with the Dow Jones average of
30 industrials slipped 2.67 to 2,063.12. Bond prices and the dollar
rose slightly. The 11.6 percent capital spending increase over the
1987 spending total, if realized, would mark the biggest percentage
jump since a 16.6 percent rise in 1984, when American industry was
still recovering from the steep 1981-82 recession.
   ``Capital spending is the main driving force in the economy at
the present time and there are no signs that it is going to ease
off,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   So far this year, business spending on plant and equipment and a
boom in export sales have accounted for almost three-fourths of
total economic growth.
   The two developments are closely related, as American
manufacturers have rushed to expand production facilities in an
effort to meet growing overseas demand for their goods.
   Sinai estimated one-third of U.S. industry is operating at full
capacity, providing a strong incentive to boost investment.
Overall, American industry is operating at 83.5 percent of
capacity, the highest rate in eight years.
   The high operating rates have led to concerns that the economy
is beginning to push against capacity constraints and tight labor
markets, resulting in rising inflationary pressures.

   Stock prices drifted slightly higher around midday
Friday, after recovering from sharply lower levels near the opening.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 2.8
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,742.6 at about 12:45 p.m. local time,
just 0.1 percent below its best level of the day.
   The index dropped as much as 22.1 points in early trading.
   Dealers said they were puzzled by the sudden surge in prices.
Buyers poured in, afraid of missing out on the market's recovery,
and market makers chased prices higher, dealers said.
   ``We are seeing quite a bit of buying at lower levels,'' said
one dealer.
   Volume was better than it has been for several days, with 239.6
million shares changing hands by midday, compared with 226.8
million shares at the same time Thursday.

   A case of mistaken identity spurred a $2 million
run on a Chinatown thrift.
   Hundreds of customers, most of them Chinese, lined up Thursday
at Elmhurst Federal Savings and Loan Association to withdraw money
after confusing the thrift with a financially troubled bank in the
suburb of Elmhurst.
   The assets of that institution, United Security Bank, Inc., were
frozen by a judge last week after a business customer reported
receiving a $1.8 million loan in the form of a check that bounced.
The bank was not properly licensed, the state said.
   ``The headline was, `Elmhurst Bank Fails,''' said David G.
Plummer, president of Elmhurst Federal Savings and Loan
Association. ``I think many of our customers don't even know
there's a town named Elmhurst.''
   Despite a sign in the thrift's window explaining the difference
in Chinese, customers weren't taking any chances, and about 300
showed up Thursday to withdraw their money, Plummer said.
   Withdrawals for the week totaled nearly $2 million by the end of
the day, he said, although he did not expect the run to threaten
his institution.
   ``This is a $35 million branch. We're one of the strongest
savings and loans in the nation,'' he said. ``If we lost $3
million, that's no problem.''
   Plummer said he believed the worst was over Thursday, because
community leaders were working to get the word out, talking with
customers in the thrift's lobby and through a local Chinese
newspaper.
   ``I understand that they say this one is not in trouble, but
it's better to be safe,'' said Tom Moy, 34, a depositor who stood
in line for an hour before getting in the door Thursday.
   Barry Yee translated to the crowd outside, trying to explain the
mixup.
   ``My parents told me that in China, banks were not insured and
when one closed, you just lost your money,'' he said. ``That's what
they believe is happening here today. They just believe in old
ways.''

   Prices moved lower in early trading on Wall
Street today as investors shied away from taking major positions
before the weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks edged down 4.09
points to 2,059.03 as of 10 a.m. EDT.
   Declining issues held a 4-to-3 lead over advancers on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 16.42 million shares after the
first half-hour of trading.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department announced that
inflation at the wholesale level rose 0.6 percent in August.
Discounting the volatile food and energy categories, wholesale
prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in August, half the increase of
July.
   Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the inflation figures had little effect on trading
today, as Wall Street had expected a 0.5 percent overall increase
in wholesale prices.
   ``What you see here is pre-weekend malaise,'' he said.
   Wachtel said many traders were reluctant to take major positions
in advance of what will be a four-day weekend for market players
who will be observing the Jewish New Year on Monday and Tuesday.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Ramada Inc.,
which was unchanged at 9} after receiving a $397 million buyout bid
from the Pritzker family, owners of Hyatt Hotels.
   Polaroid was a big gainer, rising 1~ to 41} as Shamrock Holdings
began a $42-a-share hostile tender offer for the camera
manufacturer.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.36 to 150.10. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index slipped 0.19 to 296.81.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.67 to
2,063.12. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 8 on
the NYSE, 765 up, 677 down and 519 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 149.38 million shares, up from 139.50
million in the previous session.

   The White House is studying a possible veto of
legislation that would bar the Reagan administration from any
last-minute oil lease sales in portions of the Pacific and Atlantic
oceans and the Gulf of Mexico, an official said today.
   ``We are still considering our position,'' said Barbara Clay, a
spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.
``We are carefully reviewing the legislation.''
   The proposed prohibitions, opposed by the administration, are
contained in the fiscal 1989 spending bill for the Interior
Department, U.S. Forest Service and some Energy Department research
programs.
   The $9.9 billion appropriations package is heading toward the
president's desk following its approval by Congress on Thursday.
The Senate passed it by voice vote; the House endorsed it on a
359-45 roll call.
   The margin of approval in the House indicates the legislation
has sufficient support to ensure its backers could win a
veto-override vote.
   The bill would continue, through September 1989, a ban on
Interior Department sales of oil leases off the coasts of northern
California and Massachusetts and reinstitute a drilling ban for the
waters off southwestern Florida.
   This would stop the administration from holding lease sales for
these areas during its final months in office. Both presidential
candidates _ Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis _
have said they oppose petroleum development in sensitive offshore
waters.
   Dropped from the compromise package was a House provision, also
drawing fire from the administration, that sought to require at
least 50 percent U.S. labor and materials for petroleum facilities
along the outer continental shelf.
   The spending bill, which contains no major new programs, would
provide $190 million for the Energy Department's clean-coal
research efforts in fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1.
   This is $335 million less than the administration said it needed
to fulfil President Reagan's pledge to Canada to spend $2.5 billion
over five years in a search for ways to curb U.S. emissions of
pollutants that cause acid rain.
   In a letter to lawmakers last month, James C. Miller III,
director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, cited
the refusal of Congress to commit $525 million to the clean-coal
program in fiscal 1989 as another reason the bill might be vetoed.
   Since then, however, administration officials and congressional
leaders have discussed their differences and may be near an
agreement that could make the partial funding acceptable to the
White House, according to an administration source who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Miller also has objected to giving states more than $150 million
for energy conservation programs, which he said should not be
federally financed. His letter also complained about putting more
than $60 million into Indian health facilities when existing
facilities have a 50 percent vacancy rate.
   The bill calls for the National Park Service to receive $1
billion in fiscal 1989, some $280 million more than Reagan proposed
in his budget and about $100 million higher than fiscal 1988.
   The U.S. Forest Service would receive $1.84 billion in fiscal
1989, an increase of about $625 million over the current level and
about $230 million more than the administration requested.
   The bill sets a goal of selling 11.45 billion board feet of
lumber from public forests, 198 million more board feet than the
administration proposed. Road-building money would total about $176
million, down some $20 million from fiscal 1988.

   Wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.6 percent in
August as energy prices rose at their steepest clip since April but
food costs posted only moderate gains, the government said today.
   If the August increase held for 12 straight months, inflation at
the wholesale level would amount to 6.9 percent, more than triple
the 2.2 percent 1987 price rise.
   Food prices one step short of the retail level were up a
moderate 0.4 percent, the same as in July and another indication
that the effects of the drought are moderating after steep rises in
May and June.
   Energy prices rose a sharp 2.2 percent with gasoline costs up
3.8 percent. Natural gas prices rose 3.6 percent as heating oil
costs fell 0.2 percent.
   For the first eight months of 1988, the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index for finished goods was up 4.3 percent,
calculated on an annual basis and adjusted for normal seasonal
variations.
   Although the overall August rise was the steepest gain since an
identical 0.6 percent leap in March, there were some optimistic
signs in last month's report.
   Passenger car prices, which had risen steeply early in the
summer, were up a moderate 0.3 percent last month.
   Clothing costs, after soaring earlier in the year, were down 0.4
percent for men and boys and up a slight 0.1 percent for women and
children.
   Among food costs, a sharp 12.6 percent rise for eggs and a 9.6
price gain for vegetables were offset by a 6.4 percent drop in
fruit prices and by declines for rice, chicken and beef.
   Analyst Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University said fruit
trees stressed by the summer heat had produced their fruit early.
   As for meats, the 0.6 percent dip in beef prices was more
moderate than the 2.5 percent July decline as pastures began to
recover from the drought and farmers sent fewer animals to
slaughter.
   Analysts expect meat prices to rise through the winter because
drought-induced summer slaughtering will produce shortages in the
coming months.
   Ratajczak said a shortage of unleaded gasoline at the peak of
the summer vacation season contributed to the energy price rise.
   ``We've had a very strong driving season and heavy demand for
gasoline. ... We expect that to fall off as soon as the driving
season ends, which traditionally is after Labor Day,'' he said.
   However, he warned that natural gas prices will continue rising
as the weather turns colder.
   Analysts, however, expect energy prices to level off as crude
oil prices have recently fallen, anticipating production increases
resulting from the cease fire between Iran and Iraq.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, wholesale
prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in August after an increase
double that in July.
   Because food and energy costs fluctuate widely from month to
month, most analysts look to prices for other goods as a better
indication of underlying inflation.
   Ratajczak said the July increase in non-food and energy items
was likely an aberration caused by what he called the ``catalog
effect'' _ producers adjusting their price lists at mid-year.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``Fluctuations of this size are commonly observed. We still believe
inflation is under control.''
   Wholesale prices for intermediate goods provided another
optimistic sign, rising only 0.4 percent, their smallest gain since
February. Raw material prices were up a sharp 1.1 percent but had
fallen by a like percentage in July.
   The producer price index measures prices at three levels of
production: crude or unprocessed (such as wheat or cotton);
intermediate (flour or cloth), and finished (bread and clothing).
   The August increase for finished goods overall put the index at
108.8, meaning that a variety of goods costing $100 at wholesale in
1982 would havecost $108.80 last month. That compares with a
$108.50 in July and $105.90 in August 1987.
   Unlike the month-to-month percentage changes, the index numbers
are not adjusted for seasonal variations.
   Price changes at the retail level usually lag one to three
months behind those at the finished-goods level. Monthly consumer
price inflation has averaged 4.5 percent, on an annual basis, this
year. August figures for consumer prices are to be released Sept.
21.

   Now that the Securities and Exchange Commission
formally has accused Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. of extensive
fraud, seasoned attorneys for the Wall Street giant are eager to
get hold of the evidence and face SEC adversaries who are largely
inexperienced at trial work.
   ``We're going to press ahead,'' one of the people familiar with
Drexel's legal strategy said Thursday as the nation's fifth-largest
securities firm moved quickly to begin preparing its defense
against the SEC's civil charges.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office, which has been conducting a parallel probe of
Drexel, had issued ``target letters'' to the firm's junk-bond chief
Michael Milken and at least four others, indicating they will seek
criminal indictments of them soon.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying the letters
were issued when the SEC filed its civil charges in Manhattan
federal court against Drexel, Milken and others late Wednesday.
Attorneys for Milken and the other prospective defendants declined
comment, as did the U.S. attorney's office.
   Lawyers watching from the sidelines said the SEC-Drexel
confrontation probably would be the decade's biggest securities law
story and they expected the securities firm to scrap it out in
court.
   ``It's hard to say they welcome the suit, but I suspect they
welcome the opportunity to fight out in the open as opposed to
dealing with innuendos,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a New York
securities attorney.
   Others said Drexel attorneys likely would aggressively request
information from the SEC in the pretrial fact-gathering process,
known as discovery. Under civil-law procedures, the SEC must comply
with many of these requests.
   Some lawyers familiar with the SEC's enforcement strategies said
Drexel now enjoys a significant advantage because it had reserved
tens of millions of dollars for a legal brawl and retained talented
attorneys to face a budget-strapped federal agency with seasoned
investigators but rookie trial lawyers.
   ``The commission is superb at conducting investigations, but
once it moves into the litigation arena, it doesn't have the same
strengths,'' said one former SEC attorney now in private practice,
who agreed to discuss the matter only if not quoted by name.
   ``This is going to be a scorched earth defense; you press them
as hard as you can,'' the attorney said. ``You come out with
discovery, press them with all kinds of document requests and a
more detailed articulation of the charges. That will keep them on
the defensive.''
   Representing Drexel is a battery of attorneys that includes the
New York firm of Cahill, Gordon and Reindel, which has a highly
skilled litigation staff. Drexel ``junk bond'' chief Michael
Milken, another key defendant, has retained a legal defense force
that includes Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, another
high-powered New York firm.
   Nevertheless, the Drexel-SEC court battle could be weeks and
even months away, largely because the case may stall until the U.S.
attorney's office finishes a criminal investigation of the firm.
   Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, known to have
impaneled a grand jury inquiry of Drexel, could intervene to halt
the civil discovery process if he believes it would compromise his
effort.
   Although there has been widespread speculation that the criminal
probe may be completed over the next several weeks, federal
prosecutors persistently have declined to confirm or deny it.
   The people familiar with Drexel's strategy said senior
executives already had acted to calm staffers nervous about the
scope and seriousness of the SEC's civil charges.
   They contended the charges contained no surprises and appeared
to mirror what Drexel's lawyers anticipated after the SEC disclosed
to the firm in late May that it had authorized an enforcement
action.
   At the same time, these people said, Drexel's attorneys had
started preparing documents to demand the SEC's evidence. They said
a conference of both sides was expected soon before U.S. District
Judge Milton Pollack, who was assigned the case.
   The SEC charged in a 184-page complaint filed Wednesday in
Manhattan federal court that from 1984 to 1986, Drexel secretly
schemed with now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky to cheat the
firm's clients, trade illegally on inside information, manipulate
stocks, lie to the government and falsify records.
   The enforcement agency depicted Drexel and key employees as
systematically having violated a range of securities laws involving
some of the biggest takeover deals of the decade, in which Drexel
often played a role as financier. The defendants have denied
wrongdoing and predicted vindication.

   Venezuela and Algeria have called
for a special meeting of OPEC's price-monitoring committee to help
stem the decline in oil prices, a Saudi Arabian newspaper reported
Friday.
   The newspaper Al-Sharq Bali quoted unnamed ``high-level Arab oil
sources'' as saying the two OPEC member nations proposed a meeting
for Sept. 21 in Bali, Indonesia.
   Some oil futures prices, meanwhile, moved slightly higher
following the report. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, October
contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude,
rose 5 cents to $14.53 per 14-gallon barrel.
   The Saudi newspaper said a ``moderate'' member of the
five-member pricing committee was opposed to holding a special
meeting, saying it expected world oil prices to improve as winter
approaches.
   The unidentified member also was opposed, the newspaper said,
because the pricing committee would have to call for an emergency
full session of the 13-nation cartel and a regular meeting already
was set for Nov. 21 in Vienna.
   Besides Venezuela and Algeria, the other members of the OPEC
pricing committee are the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Nigeria
and Indonesia.

   An estimted 26,000 rail employees went on strike
today against the Chicago & North Western railroad in a dispute
over the company's move to eliminate the jobs of more than 1,000
union brakemen.
   The orchestrated walkout began at 9 a.m. CDT as agreed Thursday
between the company and members of the United Transportation Union
to avoid snarling thousands of Chicago-area commuters who ride C&NW
trains from the suburbs.
   But the fate of the evening rush hour remained in the hands of
Congress, where the House was scheduled to consider a version of a
Senate bill passed Thursday that would impose a settlement between
the UTU and railroad.
   ``It is scheduled to be the first thing up ... It will be rushed
to the president, the president should sign it within an hour or
so,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   However, consideration of the bill was delayed, and a vote was
not expected until the afternoon, said Mike Bushman, an aide to
Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill.
   C&NW is a leading Midwestern freight hauler and also runs
commuter trains serving 40,000 people a day in Chicago's suburbs.
   Union members had planned to walk out at 12:01 a.m., when a
36-day cooling-off period in the dispute ran out, but held off
until 9 a.m. after Simon and Bruce helped persuade the railroad to
postpone layoffs of freight brakemen.
   The bill would implement recommendations of a presidential
emergency board and cut 689 brakemen in its 10-state freight
operations. The railroad had sought to lay off 1,150. The board was
appointed by President Reagan in April.
   ``Right now we know of no opposition in the House,'' Simon said
Thursday.
   Union representatives said Thursday the dispute should be
resolved at the bargaining table and not on Capitol Hill.
   ``It would be a great injustice to the working man if they pass
this (Simon) law,'' said Don Markgraf, general chairman of the UTU.
``The politicians should be home getting elected instead of fooling
around in labor disputes.''
   Some union members threatened to stay off the job no matter what
Congress decides.
   David Wells, a brakeman, said union members planned to disperse
within a 100-mile radius of Chicago and not be available to be
called back to work today because they were angry about C&NW's
handling of the dispute.
   ``Most of our people were docked pay'' during a brief, two-hour
strike Aug. 4, Wells said. ``We informed our commuters that we
didn't anticipate there would be an evening rush hour.''
   Markgraf said he hadn't heard of such a plan and attributed it
to rumors.
   C&NW officials said intervention was needed to avert a strike.
   ``In this case collective bargaining did not work and we're
happy Sen. Simon stepped in,'' said Leslie Cleveland, a railroad
spokeswoman.
   Under the Railway Labor Act, Congress and the president have
authority to settle railroad disputes that threaten national
commerce.
   The railroad and the union have been battling for more than a
year over the size of crews on C&NW freight trains.
   The company contends the brakemen's jobs are obsolete; the union
argues the brakemen _ two on each train's crew _ are neeeded to
maintain safety.
   The UTU struck C&NW for about four hours Aug. 4, after an
earlier cooling-off period imposed by President Reagan. Congress,
however, ended that strike quickly by imposing a second cooling-off
period _ which expired today.

   It's been a stormy four years for the
Zondervan Corp., beleaguered by securities law violations, hostile
takeover attempts, lawsuits and almost two years on the selling
block.
   But the Christian book publishing company is closing that
tumultuous chapter and looking forward to a bright future,
unconcerned about the less-than-holy reputation of its new owner _
media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
   ``Through it all, there's been a remarkable calm on the part of
our people,'' said James Buick, Zondervan president and chief
executive officer. ``Part of it is that their confidence in God
transcends their concern about external problems.''
   The company, a leading publisher and retailer of Bibles and
evangelical Christian books and music, began facing those external
problems after it posted net losses for the first time in 1984-85.
The losses were revealed in an investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, prompting lawsuits and, finally, a takeover
attempt by disgruntled shareholders in 1986.
   The company struck a deal with the shareholders in October 1986
and agreed to find a buyer.
said.
   And Buick said selected works from Harper & Row's list of about
300 religious titles might fit Zondervan bookstores, most of which
are located in shopping malls.
   Zondervan carries about 1,500 titles, including its popular
Christian romance series, Serenade, and such best sellers as
Charles Colson's ``Kingdoms In Conflict,'' and, in the past,
autobiographies by John Hinckley's parents and former automaker
John DeLorean.
   Zondervan's flagship product, though, is its New International
Version of the Bible, a popular, modern translation available in
more than 30 editions.
   Zondervan Family Bookstores carry printed and recorded gospel
music, greeting cards, audiocassettes on topics ranging from how to
save a rocky marriage to cooking, as well as posters and smaller
items like key rings and note pads _ all with a Christian message.
   Buick said he hopes the merger will mean the company can expand
its retail operations by about 10 bookstores a year and acquire
other smaller Christian publishers.

<HEAD>Fear Of AIDS Brings Spreading Usage Of Rubber Gloves</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NR1 of Sept. 6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationwide shortage of rubber gloves appears
to be easing, but you wouldn't know it from talking to Estella
Williams.
   The obstetrics-gynecology nurse at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center isn't even using rubber gloves because they have become too
expensive. She gets vinyl ones _ oversized _ instead.
   ``You can pull a glove on and it rips. Sometimes you're washing
(instruments) and you find out it has a hole in it, so what good is
that?'' she said recently.
   Ms. Williams' employer says there is no hospital-wide problem
with gloves. But across the country, the AIDS crisis has led to a
dramatic increase in the use of gloves, resulting in shortages,
high prices and the importation of millions of defective gloves.
   A leap in production has alleviated the shortage somewhat in
recent months, and most forecasters say it will continue to ease as
new factories in the United States and Southeast Asia gear up
production.
   But some people say the shortage could worsen again if the fear
of AIDS prompts people in other countries to become as fastidious
about covering their hands as Americans have become.
   ``If all the industries that have physical touching with people
start to use gloves, there's not enough gloves in the world,
ever,'' said Edward Skonezny, president of American Consolidated
Products Inc. in Santa Ana, Calif., who imports gloves and has an
interest in promoting the idea that the shortage could worsen again.
   The increased glove use stems from a new wariness about bare
hands in a disease-conscious society. So many people are wearing
gloves now that those who need them most _ doctors, dentists,
nurses and the like _ are having trouble getting their hands in
them.
   In the United States, gloves are being worn by people ranging
from hairdressers, toll station attendants and prison guards to
food-service workers _ even though the Centers for Disease Control
says there are no reports of AIDS being spread by food preparation.
   ``The AIDS virus, surprisingly, is very difficult to transmit.
... A lot of this is hysteria or paranoia or whatever you want to
call it,'' said Chuck Fallis, a spokesman for the national Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   ``It's almost a habit. You're putting on gloves even when you
don't know if you'll be doing anything (that would require them),''
said Dr. Robert Auerbach, a New York dermatologist.
   ``When my local bartender gives me a glass of whisky with a
glove on, I'll really start to get worried,'' said Ted Presler,
vice president for marketing at Guthrie Latex Inc. in Tucson,
Ariz., the U.S. unit of Malaysia-based Kumpulan Guthrie Berhad.
   So far, at least, glove use has not caught on overseas the way
it has in the United States.
   In Britain's National Health Service, the system of socialized
medicine, workers generally do not use gloves except in the
operating room, for lab work, and when coming in contact with blood
and other body fluids.
   Japan has had only 90 AIDS cases since 1985, when the first was
diagnosed, and glove use remains low, although it is growing
rapidly. An importer in Osaka said demand had doubled in the last
two years.
   Africa has the world's worst AIDS problem, but the continent's
poverty and lack of good medical care are likely to limit the use
of gloves there.
   Southeast Asia, the world center of rubber production, is a big
winner from the boom in glove use. Prices have nearly tripled for
latex, the milky liquid form of rubber from which gloves are made,
and glove factories are opening by the dozens.
   Malaysia, the world's biggest rubber producer, expects to churn
out 2 billion gloves from 30 factories this year and aims for 4
billion from 60 or more factories next year, said Dr. Lim Sow
Ching, head of the Malaysian Rubber Research and Development
Board's Economic Planning Division.
   That much production could drive prices back down nearly to
their pre-crisis levels even with increasing use of gloves. Also
gearing up glove production are Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and
China, as well as the United States.
   Global demand is hard to estimate, but Malaysia estimates
current annual demand is about 13 billion to 15 billion gloves a
year.
   Some glove users have never felt the pinch of the shortage
because they have been sheltered by U.S.-based medical supply
companies, which kept prices down to avoid alienating customers.
   ``The reputable manufacturers of latex medical products have not
taken advantage of the situation at all. Our major concern is
really to increase capacity,'' said Eugene Freed, senior vice
president for marketing at Ansell-Americas of Tinton Falls, N.J.,
the nation's biggest maker of non-sterile exam gloves.
   A lack of factories is the main cause of the glove shortage,
along with a lack of centrifuges, which spin excess water out of
raw latex. Latex prices, although they have roughly tripled, still
account for a relatively small portion of the price of gloves.
   Increased condom use has not had much effect on latex prices
because they use less of it. A pound of latex makes 60 gloves, but
nearly 300 condoms.
   Speculators, as well, contributed to the shortage by buying up
supplies and withholding latex from the market, said Douglas Kerr,
vice president of production at National Latex Products Co. in
Ashland, Ohio.
   Kerr said he was not accusing his own suppliers of speculation,
but he believes that kind of activity drove latex prices up.
Similar accusations have been made about the glove market.
   ``They saw this as a commodity like sugar or rice. They got in
quick and they got out quick. These people had money,'' said Edward
Sun, vice president for marketing in the New York office of at
General Pacific International Corp., a trading company with
headquarters in Hong Kong.
   Hoarding is also contributing to the shortage, Kerr said. He
compared it to the gasoline crisis of the early 1970s, when people
kept their tanks topped off.
   Prices for a box of 100 gloves rose in the spot market to $15 a
box, and some desperate doctors and dentists reportedly paid more
than $20 a box. Since then prices have fallen back below $10 a box,
distributors say.
   Problems with the quality, price and availability of gloves all
stem from the panic over contamination, and even many in the
industry believe the fears are overblown.
   ``I think we've created our own crisis here. I can say from my
own point of view it's been a very nice crisis, but I don't know
that it's helped the cause of health care any,'' said Jack Bennett
Sr., president of Medical Companies of America Inc. in Phoenix,
Ariz.

<HEAD>SEC Chairman Denies Drexel Suit an Attack on Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission said Friday that his agency's sweeping stock-fraud suit
against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is not attack on the securities
industry overall.
   ``It is my opinion that the securities industry in the United
States is essentially an honest, well-run industry,'' Chairman
David Ruder told a House subcommittee. In the Drexel case, he said,
the SEC is ``attempting to find those people in the industry who do
not fit the mold of the industry itself.''
   Ruder defended Wall Street when asked by Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee on finance,
whether the Drexel allegations reflect widespread abuse or whether
the problem is confined to a few companies.
   ``These allegations, if true, represent a blistering, scalding
commentary on the culture of Wall Street in the 1980s,'' Markey
said.
   In a suit filed Wednesday in federal court in New York, the SEC
accused Drexel; Michael Milken, the firm's executive vice
president; and three other Drexel employees of violating securities
laws, including prohibitions against insider trading, stock
manipulation and defrauding clients.
   Drexel has denied the civil allegations, which could lead to
stiff fines and even to removal of the company's brokerage license.
   Federal prosecutors have not disclosed whether they will file
criminal charges. Ruder said SEC investigators have maintained a
continuing relationship with the U.S. attorney in New York, but he
would not elaborate.
   Ruder and the SEC's chief enforcer, Gary Lynch, said the Drexel
litigation and similar cases have stretched the agency's resources
to the limit. Because of staff limitations, they said, the Drexel
case may force the SEC to forgo other initiatives.
   There is a growing tendency in the securities industry to
challenge SEC complaints, rather than settle out of court, Ruder
said. Two years ago, 18 SEC cases were being litigated; today there
are 60, he said.
   Ruder said the $160 million SEC budget the Reagan administration
sought for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 is ``the minimum for the
commission to fulfill its responsibilities.''
   ``The commission has reached the limits of its resources in
efficiency, and now needs additional resources,'' he said.
   Ruder and Lynch discounted suggestions that the Drexel case, if
successful, could doom the ``junk bond'' industry, in which Drexel
is a leader. That is the term given a relatively new form of
high-risk, high-yield security often used to finance corporate
takeovers or now enterprises.
   ``One can characterize the complaint as not involving junk
bonds, and therefore there is not any connection,'' Ruder said.
   ``There is nothing inherent in the trading of junk bonds that
requires one be involved in fraud or manipulation,'' said Lynch.
   Ruder said the SEC is ``absolutely confident we are going to
prevail'' in the Drexel case, and defended the fact the agency
spent two years and documented 17 allegations before filing the
complaint.
   Rep. Howard C. Nielson, R-Utah, complained that ``you could have
shaken us (Congress) nicely with only three or four'' allegations
several months earlier, ``when there was still time for this
session of Congress to act.''
   ``We have a potent array of weapons'' against fraud already,
Ruder replied, indicating no new legislation would have helped in
the pursuit of the Drexel case.
   Nevertheless, he said he supports a bill sponsored by Markey and
others, due for a House vote next week, that would toughen laws
against insider trading _ the profiting from access to non-public
information.
   ``An increase in sanctions in the insider-trading area will be
helpful,'' Ruder said.

   Ford Motor Co. and the Japanese automaker
Nissan were expected to announce plans next week for a joint
venture that would manufacture minivans at a yet-to-be-built Ohio
plant.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, who will be in Japan from Sunday
through Thursday, has scheduled a news conference with Ford and
Nissan officials in Tokyo Monday to announce the venture, according
to an itinerary released by Celeste's office Thursday.
   Ford and Nissan officials have yet to confirm plans for the
joint venture.
   Ford reportedly has considered plans to build a factory next to
its Ohio Truck Plant in Avon Lake, according to a proposal Ford
officials submitted to Lorain County communities last week.
   Ford executives reportedly were to discuss the project during a
board of directors meeting Thursday in Detroit, but Ford spokesman
John Spelich would not confirm whether the venture was in fact on
the agenda.
   Asked whether Ford planned to make any announcements Monday,
Spelich said only, ``That's a possibility.''

<TEXT>
   Britain's Carlton Communications PLC said
Friday it has agreed to buy Technicolor Inc., the film duplicating
company whose trademark appears on many top movies, for $780
million.
   Carlton will buy Technicolor, which makes prints of movies and
also has a presence in the booming videocassette duplication
market, from a company controlled by Revlon Group Inc. Chairman
Ronald Perelman.
   The acquisition would put Carlton in the front lines of the U.S.
and European markets for videocassette duplication and film
processing.
   Besides those activities, Carlton has interests in other
television post-production services and manufactures high-tech
video production equipment used by broadcasters.
   ``The acquisition of Technicolor represents a unique opportunity
for Carlton to establish itself as the largest provider of services
to the growing television and film markets in the U.S.A. and in
Europe,'' Carlton said in a statement.
   The announcement follows Carlton's purchase in March of
Philadelphia-based Modern Video Inc., a high-speed duplicator of
videocassettes, for about $83 million.
   Technicolor, based in Los Angeles, is privately held, as is its
parent company, MacAndrews & Forbes Group Inc. of New York.
MacAndrews & Forbes, which makes licorice and cigars, is owned by
Perelman.
   The sale is expected to be completed Oct. 4, pending approval of
Carlton shareholders, the company said.
   Following the acquisition of Technicolor, Carlton will have
videocassette duplication plants in California, Michigan,
Philadelphia, London, and the Netherlands. It will also have film
processing plants in Los Angeles, New York, London and Rome.
   Technicolor makes the prints of movies that are distributed to
theaters. Its major print customers include the Warner Bros.,
Tri-Star and Paramount studios and it makes videocassettes for
Warner Bros., Disney, Lorimar, Home Box Office and CBS-Fox.
   For all of 1987, Technicolor had an operating profit of $46.9
million on sales of $288.9 million.
   Carlton estimated that for the year ending Sept. 30 it will post
pre-tax profits of at least $82 million, up around 40 percent from
the previous year.

   The advertising agency fired last week by
International Business Machines Corp. said Friday it was laying off
about a third of its 270 employees.
   Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein Inc. said the cuts of about 90
people were effective immediately and were intended ``to match the
level of its current and anticipated business.''
   IBM announced Sept. 2 it was firing its long-time ad agency,
which created the memorable campaign featuring a Charlie
Chaplin-like character and the more recent one reuniting the former
stars of the television show ``M-A-S-H.''
   It hired Lintas:USA, a unit of the Interpublic Group of
Companies, and Wells, Rich Greene Inc. for its U.S. advertising
duties.
   IBM reportedly accounted for about half of Lord, Geller's $200
million in annual billings. The firm, a unit of WPP Group PLC, has
been in turmoil since six of its top executives walked off the job
in March, complaining of interference from WPP.
   Lord, Geller said it would pay employees' salaries for 90 days
and maintain medical benefits and life insurance until the end of
the year.
   ``We are saddened that we are forced to take these actions. The
people affected are highly dedicated and talented professionals,''
Bill Wardell, the president, said in a statement. He said the
company's commitment to its other clients and to seeking new
business was unchanged.

   Window service at the nation's post offices,
cut last February to save money, is being restored starting
Saturday.
   Most post offices cut hours by about a half-day a week to help
cope with $160 million in congressionally imposed spending cuts.
The service reductions came two months before postage rate hikes,
which took nearly a year to put into effect, were instituted to
cope with a rising deficit by the Postal Service.
   The unexpected spending reduction came as part of overall cuts
in government expenditures aimed at reducing the budget deficit,
even though the Postal Service no longer receives a taxpayer
subsidy.
   While the the postal window hours will be restored, the new
hours will not necessarily be the same as those that were in effect
at each office before the closings were imposed, officials said.
   Local managers were given the option to adjust hours to suit the
needs of their communities.
   For example, Saturday hours will not be restored in heavily
Jewish sections of New York City, where little business was done on
that day anyway because of observance of the Sabbath. Instead,
managers will experiment with staying open later some days or
perhaps having some Sunday office hours.
   In other areas, instead of extending hours overall, managers
will add more clerks to handle business during peak times.
   While the hours of window clerk service are returning, other
money-saving cuts imposed in February remain in effect, including
the curtailment of Sunday mail-sorting and the moratorium on
construction of new post offices.
   Congress, meanwhile, is considering bills to remove the Postal
Service from the federal budget, as a means to avoid similar
service reductions in the future. The window closings saved about
$40 million, officials reported.
   Unless action is taken, the Postal Service faces another $270
million in spending cuts in the 1989 fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
   That will not mean that hours will be cut again, however.
   Postal managers say they have found ways to cut spending _
although at the cost of slower service _ by such things as
switching some mail from airplanes to trucks, changing trucking
schedules, reducing management travel and training expenditures and
cutting research and development.
   The Postal Service expects to finish the current fiscal year
with a deficit of between $500 and $550 million.
   Higher postage rates, which took effect last April 4, are
expected to help boost the agency into the black in fiscal 1989,
however.
   The Postal Service has managed to break even, on average, over
the last decade, losing money in some years and showing a surplus
in others.

   Grain and soybean futures closed strongly lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade on pre-weekend profit-taking
and book-squaring ahead of Monday's government crop production
report.
   ``This is the first significant correction we've had in several
weeks,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc.
in Chicago.
   Karlin said traders planning to stay home Monday for the
beginning of the Jewish New Year took profits Friday to minimize
their risk ahead of the Agriculture Department's crop production
report, which will be released after Monday's close.
   The corn and soybean markets were shaken by a respected grain
analyst's prediction the USDA would report little drought damage to
crops occurred last month.
   Chicago-based analyst Conrad Leslie estimated 1988 U.S. corn
production at 4.42 billion bushels and soybean production at 1.46
billion bushels. Those numbers compare with the Agriculture
Department's August estimates of 4.48 billion bushels of corn and
1.47 billion bushels of soybeans.
   Leslie's numbers were significantly higher than the average
private analyst's estimates of 4.21 billion bushels of corn and
1.42 billion bushels of soybeans.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 7\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $4 a bushel; corn was 2 cents
to 5 cents lower with September at $2.85{ a bushel; oats were 3\
cents lower to { cent higher with September at $2.67 a bushel;
soybeans were 6 cents to 18{ cents lower with September at $8.78 a

   Stock prices rallied in late trading today after
a brief round of morning selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, down more than 15
points at its lowest levels of the day, was up 13.34 at 2,076.46 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in the
overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 766
up, 586 down and 558 unchanged.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department announced that
the producer price of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in August.
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, wholesale prices
rose a moderate 0.3 percent in August, half the increase of July.
   Larry Wachtel, a market analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the inflation figures had little effect on trading, as
Wall Street had expected a 0.5 percent overall increase in
wholesale prices.
   Wachtel said many traders were reluctant to take major positions
in advance of what will be a four-day weekend for market
participants who will be observing the Jewish New Year on Monday
and Tuesday.
   But with interest rates heading lower in the credit markets as
the session progressed, a flurry of buy orders came into the stock
market.
   Among actively traded blue chip and technology issues,
International Business Machines rose 2} to 114~; General Electric {
to 41~; Digital Equipment 2~ to 95\, and Hewlett-Packard 1| to 49[.
   Polaroid was a big gainer, rising 2 to 41~ as Shamrock Holdings
began a $42-a-share hostile tender offer for the company.
   Lotus Development fell } to 17 among the most active issues in
the over-the-counter market. The company reported ``a little
softness'' in sales for the third quarter, and said its revenues
for the period could possibly show a decline from the second
quarter.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.86 to 151.32. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .07 at 297.07.

<TEXT>
   Convicted insider trader Dennis B. Levine, whose
squealings led to the Ivan Boesky scandal and a crackdown on Wall
Street corruption, has finished his prison term but remains under
Justice Department supervision, federal officials said Friday.
   Levine was released Thursday from a Manhattan halfway house for
federal inmates, Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman Kathryn Johnson said
in a telephone query. He had been transferred there July 5 from a
prison camp in Lewisburg, Pa., where he had been confined since
April 6, 1987.
   Martin Flumenbaum, Levine's attorney, confirmed his client had
been released but would not disclose his whereabouts or whether he
was employed.
   Formerly a mergers specialist at the investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., Levine was arrested in May 1986 after the
Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of making $12.6
million in profits through illegal trading on inside information.
   After pleading guilty in a cooperation agreement with federal
prosecutors, Levine was sentenced to a two-year prison term on
charges of securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.
   Technically, he was not scheduled for release until next April
3, but his time was reduced for good behavior under federal
criminal sentencing laws.
   ``He's not serving his sentence any longer, but he's still
subject to the supervision of the U.S. Probation Office,'' said
David Chapman, executive assistant at the Lewisburg camp. ``Any
violation at all, and he would have to serve the rest of his
sentence.''
   For example, if Levine failed a drug test, consorted with other
felons, carried a gun or left the probation office's jurisdiction
area without permission, he could be returned to prison, Chapman
said.
   But ``with a white-collar criminal like this, he probably won't
have too many restrictions on him,'' Chapman added.
   Michael Luciano, chief probation officer for the Southern
District of New York, who is in charge of Levine's supervision,
said he expected no special restrictions would be established for
Levine, except for the standard rule of no travel outside the
district without permission.
   The district comprises the Manhattan and Bronx districts of New
York City plus six counties north of the city.
   Luciano said Levine also was expected to work unless he was
attending school. He would not comment on Levine's living or
employment status.
   Whatever work Levine does, it will not be related to Wall
Street. Under an SEC order against him, Levine ``is barred from any
participation in any form of the securities business, in any
capacity.''
   A 36-year-old father of two who grew up in a Queens, N.Y.
middle-class family, Levine was once regarded as an ambitious
securities professional who drove a Ferrari, ate $200 lunches and
spent more than $250,000 to renovate his swank Park Ave. apartment.
   When the SEC caught up with him in 1986, Levine admitted he had
parlayed $40,000 into a profit of $12.6 million through a five-year
scheme of insider trading on impending corporate takeovers.
   It was Levine's cooperation with federal authorities that led
them to Boesky, the Wall Street speculator who used sensitive
information provided by Levine to profit on insider trading himself.
   Boesky paid the SEC a record $100 million in illicit insider
trading profits and penalties in November 1986. He is now serving a
three-year federal prison term for conspiracy to lie to the SEC.
   Both men provided extensive information to prosecutors and
implicated other securities professionals in a widespread insider
trading scandal that has jolted the securities business and raised
a clamor about Wall Street ethics.
   The latest fallout from the Boesky scandal was a massive SEC
enforcement action Wednesday against Drexel Burnham Lambert,
Levine's former employer. The SEC accused Drexel and several key
employees with insider trading, stock manipulation, cheating
clients, falsifying records and other alleged frauds. The
defendants denied the charges.

<HEAD>AT&T Hoping For Compromise With Rivals On Unix Software</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said Friday
progress is being made toward ending a bitter dispute over control
of Unix, the base computer software that has pitted it against such
rivals as International Business Machines Corp. and Digital
Equipment Corp.
   ``We're still in negotiations'' with the Open Software
Foundation, which was formed by IBM, Digital, Hewlett-Packard Co.
and others to create a version of Unix that would not be under
AT&T's control, AT&T spokesman John Skalko said.
   Unix, which was invented by AT&T, has become popular with other
computer makers because it allows programs to run on a wide variety
of computers without alteration. However, the software has
splintered into many versions.
   The Open Software Foundation confirmed Friday it plans to base
its new version of Unix on IBM's version, AIX, but AT&T is trying
to get the group to change its plans and use the AT&T version.
   Skalko denied a report Friday which said AT&T Chairman Robert E.
Allen told securities analysts the Open Software Foundation had
agreed to use AT&T's version.
   Skalko said the report was apparently based on a
misinterpretation of Allen's speech Thursday in Boston in which he
said, ``We see the computer industry moving towards agreement on
some version of our own Unix operating system as an industry
standard.''
   Allen only meant to assert that Unix was originally developed by
AT&T, Skalko said.

<HEAD>Retired Employees File $100 Million Lawsuit Against Singer Co.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired employees of Singer Co. have
filed a $100 million class action suit seeking guarantees of their
health and life insurance benefits.
   The civil suit was filed Tuesday in federal court here on behalf
of more than 9,000 Singer retirees against the company and Florida
investor Paul Bilzerian, who acquired Singer in January for $1.06
billion.
   The Singer Retirees Action Committee said Bilzerian prompted the
suit by refusing several attempts by to discuss the benefits.
   ``I think we had to do what we had to do'' because of
Bilzerian's actions, said committee co-chairman Ralph G. Seel of
Anderson, S.C.
   A woman answering the telephone at Bilzerian's office in
Stamford said neither Singer nor Bilzerian had received
notification that the suit was filed. She declined further comment.
   Before Bilzerian acquired the company, Singer's company-financed
benefits program had agreed to pay full health insurance for
retirees and their spouses for life. Life insurance payments for
the retiree in that program only were reduced on retirement.
   The suit contends Bilzerian has ``failed to make adequate
provisions for the continuation of (retirees') health and life
insurance benefits.''
   The action does not apply to pension benefits, which the
committee does not feel are threatened, Seel said.
   Seel said the suit had to be filed while Singer still has enough
assets to guarantee the contested health and life insurance
benefits, which Singer has said cost about $10 million a year.
   Singer completed the sale last month of its two South Carolina
plants to Ryobi Ltd. of Japan.
   Bilzerian has made eight sales of Singer divisions, with
agreements pending on others. He has said he plans to sell all 12
of Singer's divisions.
   Larry Magarik, a New York attorney representing the committee,
said Thursday a retirees' victory would mean that
as-yet-unidentified Singer assets would be attached to ensure that
the benefits are paid.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former managers at a Coca-Cola syrup plant
here agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud and income tax evasion
charges in a $5 million scheme to defraud the soft drink company.
   The defendants, Hillis A. Smith Jr., 51, the plant's former
general manager, and Lewis H. Addison III, 46, the former
administrative manager, entered their pleas before U.S. District
Judge Joseph C. Howard on Thursday.
   Smith will be sentenced Nov. 1 and Addison Nov. 14.
   Under the agreement, the two said they would cooperate in a
continuing investigation of at least six unindicted co-conspirators
and to testify as government witnesses before grand juries and in
criminal trials if asked.
   Prosecutors said they would recommend the two, who were fired by
Coca-Cola in July 1987 because of the phony invoice scheme, be
given prison terms.
   As part of the plea agreement, the government said it would not
prosecute Addison's wife, Emily.
   Smith faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and $1
million in fines while Addison could receive a maximum 15-year term
and $750,000 in fines. The judge also could require restitution.
   A source familiar with the investigation told The (Baltimore)
Sun Coca-Cola already has recovered $750,000 to $1 million.
   No other people have yet been indicted on criminal charges tied
to the alleged schemes, but six of those accused in the Coca-Cola
suit were identified as co-conspirators in a statement of facts
prosecutors read in court Thursday.
   Smith and Addison opened bank accounts under fictitious
corporate names and used post office boxes to receive kickbacks and
payments on phony invoices that they approved and forwarded to
Coca-Cola's main office in Atlanta from early 1980 to mid-1987,
according to the government's statement.

<HEAD>Maxwell Willing To Make Higher Offer for Macmillan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf to update with closing stock price.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC said Friday it was
willing to sweeten its $2.34 billion tender offer for Macmillan
Inc., which also is the target of a hostile, lower offer from
Robert M. Bass Group Inc.
   Maxwell also said it would be prepared under certain
circumstances to raise its alternative offer for the U.S.
publisher's information division to $1.4 billion from its original
$1.1 billion bid.
   Macmillan has rejected as inadequate Maxwell's offer of $80 a
share for all of its outstanding stock.
   Wall Street apparently expected the bidding for Macmillan to
continue. The publisher's stock rose $3.62{ to $83.87{ a share in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.
   Maxwell's latest move followed a second meeting, on Thursday,
between its Chairman Robert Maxwell and Macmillan Chairman Edward
Evans.
   ``At this meeting Mr. Maxwell indicated that, based on the
information provided to MCC (Maxwell Communication Corp.) by
Macmillan, MCC would be prepared to consider, subject to certain
conditions, raising its alternative offer for Macmillan information
from $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion,'' Maxwell Communication said in
a statement.
   ``However Mr. Maxwell also reiterated MCC's primary wish to
acquire the whole of Macmillan and MCC's willingness to discuss
increasing the price offered above $80 a share,'' Maxwell
Communication added.
   Maxwell Communication previously had not disclosed publicly any
willingness to raise its tender offer.
   Maxwell launched its original tender offer Aug. 12. The bidder
has said from the start that if the tender offer was not acceptable
to Macmillan, it would be prepared to purchase only the information
division.
   Macmillan has proposed a restructuring plan that would involve
spinning off the information division as part of an effort to ward
off the Bass offer of $75 a share. Macmillan has rejected the Bass
offer as inadequate.
   Bass won a temporary injunction in June blocking the
restructuring plan. The Delaware Supreme Court has scheduled a
hearing Sept. 20 to consider Macmillan's appeal against the
injunction.
   The court, meanwhile, had asked Macmillan to file a memo by
Friday informing it about recent events and explaining whether the
company intended to go forward with the proposed restructuring in
light of the offers from Maxwell and Bass.
   Macmillan spokesman David Jackson said Macmillan had asked the
Delaware court for a delay in filing the memo until Monday. Jackson
said Macmillan's board plans to meet Saturday to prepare a
definitive response for the court.
   Last Tuesday, the court criticized Macmillan for failing to keep
it informed about the publisher's discussions with Maxwell.
   Robert Maxwell held his first meeting with Evans in London Aug.
30, at which he was supplied with information about the Macmillan
information division and the company as a whole.

   U.S. ball bearing makers warned Congress
Thursday that unfair _ and they alleged sometimes illegal _
competition from foreign manufacturers is devastating the domestic
bearing industry and is leaving the nation unable to gear up for
war-time production.
   ``I don't think the American bearing industry will wither away,
but it will continue to grow smaller and what is left will probably
be quite competitive. But it won't support military needs in a
national emergency,'' said Donald K. Brush, general manager at the
Barden Corp. in Danbury, Conn.
   Brush joined Sens. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., and Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., in a call for administration protection of the
industry.
   ``The health of the domestic industry has declined to the point
that it now endangers our national security,'' Weicker said at a
Senate Small Business Committee hearing he called to look at the
impact of foreign competitors.
   ``Without a secure domestic supply of bearings, our national
defense could become gridlocked,'' said Weicker, who represents a
state with 16 bearing plants. ``When it comes to the question of
bearings, I don't want to have to depend on any foreign nation.''
   Bearings are critical to a variety of weapons systems, including
nuclear missiles, jet engines, tanks and atomic submarines.
   The Pentagon recently installed a new policy to buy only
American-made bearings for at least three years. Industry
executives said that would help, but the problem would largely
remain because Pentagon purchases make up only 15 to 20 percent of
the market.
   ``How does U.S. business compete with the low wages and other
costs of Singapore and Thailand? No amount of modernization could
reduce costs to compete with labor rates one-19th ours,'' Brush
said.
   Last month, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity said President
Reagan would delay a decision on a 1987 industry petition urging
government restrictions on the amount of bearings imported. Verity
said the president first wants to see the impact of the Pentagon's
buy-American policy.
   Under the Omnibus Trade Bill, the president must make a decision
by Nov. 21.
   Weicker said domestic bearing production has dropped by more
than 30 percent since 1978. D'Amato said nearly 15,000 jobs and $11
billion in sales have been lost since 1979, and 31 bearing and
parts plants have closed down.
   In addition to cheaper labor costs enjoyed by foreign companies
and in some cases subsidies from their own governments, U.S. agents
are investigating charges that some foreign bearing makers are
violating customs and trade laws, dumping their products in the
U.S. market and in some cases avoiding U.S. tariffs by
under-reporting.

<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Pacific Corp. announced Thursday
that a subsidiary, Union Pacific Resources, had agreed to sell a
Wilmington, Calif., refinery to a British-owned international oil
company for $440 million.
   Union Pacific and Ultramar PLC expect to complete the sale of
the refinery before the end of this year.
   UP Chairman Drew Lewis, who moved the corporation's headquarters
here from New York last month, said Ultramar would offer employment
to all personnel associated with the refinery and its
administrative and marketing operations.
   The refinery produces approximately 100,000 barrels per day of
unleaded gasoline, diesel fuel and other petroleum products sold
primarily to independent marketers in California, Nevada and
Arizona.
   ``We view this as a very positve step,'' said Lewis. ``It gives
us latitude to redeploy some of all of these assets into businesses
which align better with our strategic objectives.''
   Union Pacific Resources, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, put
the refinery up for sale last month and also is seeking to sell a
250-mile pipeline that runs from Colton, Calif., to Las Vegas.
   Lewis said the company is continuing to evaluate bids for the
pipeline.

<HEAD>Pentland Industries To Acquire Parker Pen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentland Industries, the British industrial
conglomerate that holds a 32 percent stake in the Reebok athletic
shoe company, has agreed to acquire Parker Pen in a deal valued at
about $326 million, the Financial Times reported in its Friday
editions.
   The newspaper, Britain's leading business daily, said full
financial details were not disclosed Thursday.
   However, it said Pentland would buy between 85 percent and 90
percent of Parker for about $287 million, with the balance of the
equity being set aside for British executives who led a $100
million management buyout of the former U.S. company in 1986.
   The paper quoted Parker's chief executive, Jacques Margry, as
saying Reebok's marketing strength in the United States and Far
East would greatly help Parker's international development. More
than 60 percent of Parker's operating profits now come from Europe.
   ``You will not see Reebok pens or anything like that but the
strategy of building global brands is the same if you are selling
shoes, pens or whatever,'' Margry said.
   Reebok International Ltd. is based in Canton, Mass.
   The deal also resolves Parker's recent difficulties, which
started when a stock issue planned for last fall was scrapped as
world stock markets crashed in October, the newspaper stated.
   Parker aborted a second stock issuance attempt in June this year
after a dispute over the size of the issue between the company's
financial advisers and its venture capital investors.
   Despite its troubles, Parker has prospered with its present
management. An investor group led by managment acquired the
business in January 1986 from its former owner, Manpower Inc., of
Milwaukee, Wis.
   Parker, formerly of Janesville, Wis., lost more than $43 million
in the three years before the buy-out from Manpower, the temporary
employment concern that last year was itself acquired by Blue Arrow
PLC.
   Last year, Parker posted pre-tax profit $29 million and results
in the first half of 1988 are expected to show further improvements.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against major currencies
Friday as gold prices plunged in U.S. trading, reflecting what some
analysts said was a developing deflationary attitude about the
economy.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold fell to a bid
$421.25 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $428.50 late
Thursday.
   Gold analysts said the government's report on wholesale, or
producer, prices prompted a selloff of the precious metal after the
market failed to respond to what at first appeared to be a
higher-than-expected increase in inflation.
   ``The Producer Price Index was the source of disappointment
early,'' said Stephen Platt, a metals analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``When the market couldn't attract buying off the PPI
numbers, a lot of skepticism set in about the market's ability to
hold.''
   Investors traditionally have used gold as a hedge against
inflation.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed down sharply
at $421.20 a troy ounce, compared with $428.80 late Thursday.
   In earlier London trading, gold slipped to a late bid price of
$426.80 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $428 dollars.
In Zurich, gold climbed higher, closing at a bid $429.50 an ounce
compared with $428.50 late Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold edged up 4 cents to close at a bid $430.55 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market, where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.63 a troy ounce, compared
with Thursday's $6.58.
   On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery fell to
$6.440 a troy ounce from Thursday's $6.612.
   Meanwhile, uncertainty gripped the foreign exchange market soon
after Friday's inflation report, traders said.
   ``The foreign exchange market didn't know how to respond,'' said
George Palfi, vice president of foreign exchange marketing for
First National Bank of Chicago.
   Traders said the market rallied briefly after the report that
wholesale prices rose 0.6 percent in August. But the market quickly
settled back as it digested the numbers and found that, excluding
the volatile food and energy categories, wholesale prices rose a
moderate 0.3 percent.
   The dollar usually firms on news of higher inflation because it
indicates a possible rise in interest rates if the Federal Reserve
moves to tighten credit. Higher interest rates in turn increase the
value of dollar-denominated assets.
   Last Friday, the dollar plunged on reports that unemployment had
risen and the pace of production had slowed, suggesting the economy
was softening. Since then the dollar has seesawed as investors
remained undecided.
   But analysts said Friday's activity in the dollar and gold
markets suggest a change in investor sentiment _ that the economy
is no longer booming, but slowing down.
   Investors are now turning their attention to next week's
economic reports, primarily the U.S. trade deficit for July,
analysts said.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 1.25 Japanese yen to a closing 132.95 yen. Later,
in London, it moved back up to 133.20 yen.
   In New York trading, the dollar closed down at 133.615 yen,
compared with 133.625 late Thursday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6980 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6940 late
Thursday. Later in New York, pound cost $1.6970, compared with
$1.7000 late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Thursday included: 1.84925 West German marks, up from 1.84625;
1.56175 Swiss francs, up from 1.5571; 1.2396 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.23975; 6.2890 French francs, up from 6.2865; and 1,382.125
Italian lire, down from 1,383.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8490 West German marks, up from 1.8485; 1.5620
Swiss francs, down from 1.5600; 6.2865 French francs, down from
6.3025; 2.0835 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0855; 1,379.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,384.50; and 1.2395 Canadian dollars, unchanged.

   The Senate approved new curbs on textile,
clothing and shoe imports Friday, defying the threat of a
presidential veto just weeks before the November elections.
   ``We ought to pass this now and not put it off and deprive
American workers of jobs they could have,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond,
R-S.C., said minutes before the Senate approved the measure 57-32.
   The bill, aimed at protecting American manufacturers from
foreign competition, would freeze this year's imports of textiles,
apparel and non-rubber footwear at 1987 levels and limit their
growth to one percent annually thereafter.
   It also would bar foreign manufacturers of non-rubber footwear
from increasing their share of the American market beyond existing
levels.
   Senate supporters of the textile industry and their opponents
came away from the roll call frustrated. With 11 lawmakers not
voting, sponsors fell short of the veto-proof margin and critics
lacked the 34 votes needed to assure that a veto would be sustained.
   On the roll call, 17 Republicans joined 40 Democrats in
supporting the measure and it was opposed by nine Democrats and 23
Republicans.
   The Senate voted 68-29 on Wednesday to limit debate to 30 hours.
Friday's roll call thus appeared to represent an 11 vote falloff in
support for the textile, apparel and shoe industries.
   Seven Democratic senators who voted Wednesday to curb debate on
the issue voted against the bill itself on Friday and five others
who had favored a time limit on debate did not vote at all on
Friday.
   They appeared to be making good on an agreement by leaders
guaranteeing textile forces a vote on their bill if they would
refrain from offering it as an amendment to omnibus trade
legislation approved by Congress earlier this summer.
   Afterward U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter issued a
statement calling the action ``regrettable.''
   ``I am pleased that the margin was far short of the 67 votes
necessary to override a presidential veto,'' Yeutter said. ``A
veto, which will undoubtedly come if the bill reaches the
president's desk, should clearly be sustained.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater noted that President
Reagan had vetoed a 1985 textile protection bill and said the
president ``will veto the 1988 version if it reaches his desk.''
   ``The bill the Senate passed today is protectionism at its
worst,'' the spokesman said in a statement. ``It would bring
retaliation against U.S. exports, harm U.S. international
competitiveness and cost American jobs. That is a disastrous
prescription for America's economic future.''
   The bill's sponsor, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said he was
not trying to avoid the label protectionist.
   ``Yes, I'm a protectionist,'' he told the Senate on Thursday.
``Man, foreign importers are trading our shirts off of us. We're
going broke. We need protection.''
   Sponsors of the bill face another obstacle. Opponents are
seeking to delay until next week sending the bill back to the
House, which passed a similar version in September 1987 but now
must decide whether to go along with the Senate changes.
   Supporters say the bill would save American jobs that would be
lost to overseas competition without some protection for
hard-pressed U.S. companies. Critics say textile companies are
thriving, partly because of import restraints already in place and
also due to modernization that followed a surge in imports in the
early 1980s.
   Additional protection would merely dull U.S. industry's
competitive edge, the critics say.
   ``Somewhere along the way, we became slack or fat and we did not
have to compete,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said. ``Anything we
made, good or shoddy, could be sold in the United States or sold
overseas.''
   He said the rejuventation of European and Japanese industry
after World War II and the resulting surge of competition came as a
shock to American industry.
   ``We weren't used to it, but we're getting used to it now,''
Packwood said. ``There's no question that we can compete and we are
competing now.''
   ``The United States must compete or die,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, another outspoken critic.
   The U.S. textile and apparel industries were battered in the
early 1980s by a wave of imports and underwent a large-scale
modernization that caused layoffs. Some 300,000 textile jobs and
70,000 in the apparel sector have been lost since the start of the
decade.
   The industries concede that automation as much as foreign
competition claimed a large number of the textile jobs but note
that apparel manufacturing remains heavily labor intensive, giving
low-wage countries an edge in price competition.
   Sponsors say lower price tags have not always resulted and that
shippers, importers and retailers, who have lobbied against the
legislation, have often absorbed the cost difference. The
industries say the real problem is simply that foreign-made goods
entering the U.S. market are squeezing American-made products off
the shelves.
   But textile industry earnings did shoot up sharply last year.
   Hollings said after the vote that he was not worried about an
expected veto.
   ``Veto or no veto, I'll be back next year,'' Hollings said.
``I've been doing this for 25 years and each year we pick up more
and more support because each year we pick up more understanding as
to the dilemma the United States finds itself in in industrial
competition.''
   If the legislation, as now seems likely, arrives on President
Reagan's desk, the administration will be forced to make a
political decision.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter and six other
Cabinet members said in a letter to lawmakers on Aug. 5 that they
would recommend a veto.
   But a veto would hand Democrats the material to paint
Republicans as insensitive to the blue-collar workers Vice
President Bush is attempting to court. There has been some talk in
the cloakroom about dragging out the proceedings long enough to
enable Reagan to use a so-called pocket veto after Congress
adjourns a month from now.
   When Congress is not in session, the president may in effect
veto the legislation simply by refusing to sign it.

   Crude oil futures plunged Friday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange amid rumors Saudi Arabia had vetoed proposals for a
special meeting of the OPEC pricing committee.
   On other exchanges, contracts for future delivery of precious
metals, grains, soybeans, livestock and meat all finished
moderately to sharply lower while stock-index futures advanced.
   Crude oil futures had rallied Thursday, after hitting their
lowest levels in nearly two years, on unconfirmed rumors that the
secretariat of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
had called a special meeting of the cartel's pricing committee.
   Traders clung to expectations of such a meeting until Friday
afternoon, when new rumors surfaced that any meeting plans had been
vetoed by Saudi Arabia.
   Panic selling ensued, with the contract for October delivery of
West Texas Intermediate crude oil briefly touching $14.05 a barrel
before rebounding to $14.18 at the close.
   The contract had closed at $14.16 a barrel on Wednesday, the
lowest price for near-month delivery since Oct. 29, 1986, when the
near-month contract closed at $13.73.
   Reports that some OPEC members had produced crude oil in excess
of their quotas last month were mainly responsible for the sharp
drop in prices earlier this week.
   But Charles J. Maxwell, senior energy strategist with the New
York brokerage house C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., cited
five factors underlying the bearish trend in the oil market.
   The factors include the slow world economy; competition from
gas, coal, nuclear and other energy sources; increased oil
production in Brazil, Oman, Egypt and other non-OPEC countries; the
continuing trend toward energy conservation and discord within OPEC.
   Maxwell said oil prices probably would continue to fall until
OPEC members agree to firm production limits.
   ``If they are fearful enough and they decide to cut back
production, I can see us muddling through with prices at $14 to $15
a barrel while we work off inventories,'' he said.
   ``The disaster theory is that we go down to $9 or $10 a barrel,
which would force OPEC's hand and they would order production
curbs. That would bring us up to $15 or $16 a barrel by
mid-winter.''
   West Texas Intermediate settled 30 cents to 51 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in October at $14.18 a barrel; heating
oil was .88 cent to 1.10 cents lower with October at 40.97 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .93 cent to 1.07 cents lower with
October at 42.06 cents a gallon.
   The inflation-sensitive precious-metals market fell sharply in
reaction to the oil market's plunge after rallying earlier in the
day in response to the government's report of a 0.6 percent rise in
wholesale prices last month.
   The rally ended when traders decided the rise in wholesale
prices was not as inflationary as it looked at first blush, said
Jim Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
   Silver futures began falling at that point while gold and
platinum remained relatively firm, he said.
   ``But when the energies fell and the dollar remained strong,
there was no way that platinum and gold could resist,'' he said.
``You could describe it as almost panic selling.''
   Gold closed at its lowest level since April 1987, Steel said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $11.20 to
$11.70 lower with October at $525.80 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold was $7.70 to $8.70 lower
with October at $423.10 a troy ounce; silver was 17.2 cents to 19.2
cents lower with September at $6.44 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade on pre-weekend profit-taking ahead of Monday's government
crop production report, analysts said.
   The grain markets were shaken by a prediction from respected
Grain analyst Conrad Leslie that the USDA will report little
drought damage to crops last month.
   Wheat settled 3 cents to 7\ cents lower with September at $4 a
bushel; corn was 2{ cents to 4} cents lower with September at
$2.85} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 5 cents lower with September
at $2.63 a bushel; soybeans were 6 cents to 16 cents lower with
September at $8.77{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures moved sharply lower on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on expectations of larger supplies and slack demand next
week, analysts said. Pork futures fell in sympathy with the cattle.
   Live cattle were .65 cent to 1.30 cents lower with October at
69.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .93 cent lower
with September at 79.77 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .25
cent lower with October at 37.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .18 cent lower to .25 cent higher with February at 47.30 cents
a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled .65 point higher at 266.75.

<HEAD>Bond Prices End Higher after Volatile Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished higher Friday after
zig-zagging through a volatile trading session, pushing key
interest rates below 9 percent. The Treasury's closely-watched
30-year bond rose 9-16 point, or about $5.60 for every $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is
often an indicator of interest rate trends, fell to 8.97 percent
from 9.03 percent late Thursday.
   The 30-year issue was down about \ point, or $2.50 per $1,000,
at midday.
   Traders said prices were initially driven lower by a
discouraging government report on inflation.
   The Labor Department said wholesale prices rose a brisk 0.6
percent in August. If the August increase held for 12 straight
months, inflation at the wholesale level would amount to 6.9
percent, more than triple the 2.2 percent 1987 price rise.
   Prices then rebounded slightly when traders took a closer look
at the inflation figures and noted that much of the August increase
came from volatile energy and food prices.
   A lack of sustained buying brought another decline in bond
values, but falling prices of oil and other commodities lifted them
again, traders said.
   ``It was up, down, up, down,'' said John V. Sebastian, executive
vice president of Clayton Brown & Associates, an investment firm
based in Chicago. ``This was a real roller coaster day.''
   Traders are awaiting next week's spate of economic data, which
include government reports on the nation's trade deficit for July
and industrial production and retail sales for August.
   The general sentiment in the market is that the reports will
show continued growth in the economy, which is bearish for the
inflation-wary credit markets, said Jay Goldinger, a principal with
Capital Insight Inc., an investment firm in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   But Goldinger said the fact that ``most players are sitting on
cash looking to buy'' bonds has offset those prospects.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues edged up 1-32 point to [ point, intermediate
maturities rose 7-32 point to 5-16 point, and long-term issues
gained almost { point, according to figures provided by Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, rose 2.45 to 1,145.98.
   Corporate bonds rose slightly. Moody's Investment Grade
Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, advanced
0.66 to 289.19.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills, meanwhile, fell to 7.51
percent as the discount fell 4 basis points to 7.28 percent. Yields
on six-month bills slipped 2 basis points to 7.79 percent as the
discount declined to 7.41 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to
8.04 percent as the discount declined 2 basis points to 7.50
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted late in the day at 8[ percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Seagram Reaches $2.1 Million Settlement in Age Bias Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
announced Friday a $2.1 million settlement of a nationwide age
discrimination lawsuit against Joseph E. Seagram & Sons.
   Under the agreement, New York-based Seagram, a major
manufacturer and distributor of alcoholic beverages, will pay the
money into an escrow account to compensate employees allegedly
terminated in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
   An EEOC statement said an estimated 59 individuals would be
affected by the settlement, involving employees age 40 and older
who were terminated in a February 1985 corporate reorganization.
   The agreement resolves a lawsuit filed by the EEOC last March in
U.S. District Court in Tampa, Fla.
   The suit alleged that Seagram's 1985 reduction in its work force
violated the age discrimination statute when the company
disproportionately fired individuals age 40 and older in sales,
administrative and clerical positions.
   Awards for each eligible claimant will be based on a formula
taking into account net pay lost from February 1985 through June
1988, additional pay from July 1988 through June 1989 and a pension
enhancement, the EEOC said.
   A Seagram statement said the consent decree ``involved no
finding of violation of law by Seagram or liability to any former
employee and was made to avoid further expense in connection with
an EEOC investigation begun more than three years ago.''

   Stock prices took a zigzag path Friday, winding
up with a modest gain in continued sluggish trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which showed
double-digit gains and losses at various stages of the day, closed
with a plus 5.69 reading at 2,068.81.
   That left the average with a net increase for the week of 14.22
points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
846 up, 596 down and 523 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.54 million
shares, down from 149.38 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 165.98 million shares.
   Before the market opened, the Labor Department reported that the
producer price of finished goods rose 0.6 percent in August.
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, wholesale prices
rose a moderate 0.3 percent in August, half the increase of July.
   Larry Wachtel, a market analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., said the inflation figures had little effect on trading, as
Wall Street had expected a 0.5 percent overall increase in
wholesale prices.
   Wachtel said many traders were reluctant to take major positions
in advance of what will be a four-day weekend for market
participants who will be observing the Jewish New Year on Monday
and Tuesday.
   But with interest rates heading lower in the credit markets as
the session progressed, a brief flurry of buy orders came into the
stock market at mid-afternoon.
   Among actively traded blue chip and technology issues,
International Business Machines rose 2\ to 114]; General Electric 5
to 42; igital Equipment 2] to 94}, and Hewlett-Packard 1[ to 48|.
   Brokers said technology issues in particular benefited from
``bargain hunting'' by traders in a sector that has been hit hard
and often by selling recently.
   Polaroid was a big gainer, rising 1~ to 41} as Shamrock Holdings
began a $42-a-share hostile tender offer for the company.
   Inco Ltd. fell 1| to 25|. Analysts cited a recent drop in nickel
prices.
   Lotus Development dropped } to 17 among the most active issues
in the over-the-counter market. The company reported ``a little
softness'' in sales for the third quarter, and said its revenues
for the period could possibly show a decline from the second
quarter.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market added $7.83 billion, or 0.30
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .38 to 150.84.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.30 to 305.97, and
S&P's 500-stock composite index was up .96 at 266.84.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
climbed 1.87 to 381.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 297.45, up 1.83.

   The nation's Big Three automakers on Friday
announced they had formed a partnership for joint research into
plastics in car structures.
   For years, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. have toyed with the moving from metal to plastic bodies in
cars and light trucks. GM used plastic body parts in its Pontiac
Fiero, which it recently stopped making. GM's Chevrolet Corvette
has had a Fiberglas body for years.
   The three companies said in a joint statement two people from
each corporation would form the board of the new consortium.
   Each of the car makers will share with the others, through the
partnership, its ``pre-competitive,'' or generic, research data
into polymer-based composites. GM, Ford and Chrysler will determine
by themselves what data each company will show the others for the
next 12 years.
   Officials of each of corporation said Friday the research would
include structural plastics.
   ``What they are looking at are composite materials,'' said Don
Postma, a spokesman for the GM Technical Center in Warren, Mich.
``The advantages to the composites are the combination of light
weight and considerably more strength, not to mention corrosion
resistance.''
   ``It is the kind of strength factors that lead composites to be
considered for vehicle frames and load-carrying members of the
cars,'' he added.
   ``The goal is to develop technologies to allow (plastic)
structural parts for cars ...'' Chrysler spokesman Ben Dunn said.
``The applications that could revolutionize the industry are the
major body structural components and that is the goal of this
research.''
   ``It's a very positive step that they've taken,'' said Joseph
Miller, director of engineering materials for Du Pont Automotive
Products of Troy, Mich. ``It's a recognition by them of potential
future benefit to composite polymers used in primary structural
applications.''
   Without elaborating, Miller said, ``We've got some confidential
programs with all the car companies ... with fenders and
quarterpanels.'' Du Pont is a major supplier of plastics to the
automobile industry.
   Dunn, Postma and Joyce Stilton of Ford each said it was too
early to say how much money or staff would be involved in the joint
venture. Each of the Big Three would take on one-third of the
financial burden, the companies said.
   The consortium to share the research is the first such agreement
among the Big Three and falls under guidelines of the National
Cooperative Research Act passed in 1984.

   A federal jury Friday awarded a woman
nearly $9 million in finding that G.D. Searle & Co. made
intentional misrepresentations of the Copper-7 intrauterine device,
leading to the woman's sterility.
   The jury also decided the company was negligent in its testing
of the Copper-7, but not in its design or manufacture of the
Copper-7 worn by Esther Kociemba.
   Mrs. Kociemba, 30, of Elk River was awarded $7 million in
punitive damages, $1 million for emotional distress and $750,000
for pain and disability.
   The jury decided Mrs. Kociemba's husband, William, did not
experience the loss of consortium as a direct result of his wife's
use of the Copper-7 and did not award him damages.
   Jurors refused to comment on the verdict.
   Searle attorney Paul Strain of Baltimore said the verdict will
be appealed.
   ``It was a complex case, there was a lot of emotional rhetoric
in this case, but the safety of the Copper-7 will be established by
Judge Renner in this case, or on appeal,'' Strain said.
   Some 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most
widely used IUD in the United States before being withdrawn from
the U.S. market in January 1986 in the midst of the litigation.
   Searle won 15 of the previous 18 cases to be decided, but
Kociemba lawyers have said that none of the previous cases included
as many documents or deposition testimony as this one. Kociemba
lawyer Roger P. Brosnahan said before the trial started that it
would be ``the first real trial involving the Copper-7.''
   ``We're gratified that a jury that has finally heard all the
evidence has come to a decision we think is just,'' Brosnahan said
Friday.
   Asked if the damages award was fair, he said, ``That is
difficult to assess. Money can't recover fertility. Money can't
give you the children.''
   Mrs. Kociemba was not in court when the verdict was read. Her
whereabouts were not immediately known.
   The three previous cases lost by Searle awarded damages totaling
$550,000, Strain said earlier, including one damages award of
$250,000 that is being appealed.
   Mrs. Kociemba used a Copper-7 for just under 1{ years in 1977
and 1978. She claims that the IUD triggered a pelvic infection two
weeks after insertion and that the infection scarred her fallopian
tubes, leaving her sterile.
   Her lawyers throughout the 3{-month trial sought to establish,
through the testimony of Searle employees and former employees and
through the company's internal documents, that Searle knew of
potential health risks with the Copper-7 but did not adequately
disclose those risks to doctors or the public.
   The jury was in its 10th day of deliberations Friday after
hearing testimony that began May 17 and ended Aug. 25.
   The lead attorney for the plaintiffs, Michael Ciresi of
Minneapolis, alleged in his closing argument that Searle was
negligent in designing the device with a tailstring he said
provided a haven for bacteria that produced pelvic infections.
   Calling Searle ``a corporation which allows greed to be its
guiding beacon,'' he said the company rushed the Copper-7 to market
without proper testing. He charged it was sold to women without
adequate warning that it could cause pelvic inflammatory disease
and without warning that it was too large for many young women who
had never given birth.
   But Strain said the company exceeded FDA requirements in
marketing Copper-7. He said Ciresi did not even prove that Mrs.
Kociemba suffered from pelvic infection, let alone that it was
caused by the Copper-7.

   Roy E. Disney's Shamrock Holdings Inc.
went directly to Polaroid Corp. shareholders Friday with a cash bid
that values the company at about $2.6 billion.
   Polaroid's board of directors last month unanimously rejected an
unsolicited offer from the Burbank, Calif.-based Shamrock that
would have paid $40 a share plus 40 percent of the eventual award
in Polaroid's patent infringement lawsuit against Eastman Kodak Co.
   A percentage of that potential settlement was not included in
the new, hostile tender offer of $42 a share, which bypasses the
directors.
   Shamrock said it would add $2 a share to its bid, raising it to
$44 a share, if directors dropped their resistance to the takeover
attempt.
   On Wall Street, Polaroid stock rose $1.87{ a share to $41.75.
   ``They (Shamrock) have to start making their move and they
have,'' said Chuck Ryan, an analyst with the investment firm
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``Now the ball is in
Polaroid's court. You have to watch what Polaroid will do.''
   Ryan suggested Polaroid still had the option of looking for
friendly suitors.
   The company issued a statement touting the potential of its
restructuring plan for improving profitability, but added that the
new offer would be considered by top management.
   Analysts had said a 40 percent share of the Kodak litigation
proceeds could total $400 million to $800 million, but the increase
in the bid to $42 a share from $40 would give shareholders a
definite $124 million in cash without waiting.
   Shamrock said that if its bid succeeded, it would drop
Polaroid's embryonic venture into 35mm film. It also said it would
sell all or much of Polaroid's undeveloped real property, minimize
the excess capacity in the company's manufacturing facilities,
refocus the company's research and development activities on the
company's core businesses and negotiate a ``commercially
reasonable'' settlement of the Kodak litigation.
   The latest offer is contingent on the invalidation of Polaroid's
recent issuance of 9.7 million shares to a new employee stock
ownership plan, a move Polaroid made early in its attempt to block
Shamrock.
   If the stock ownership plan is not invalidated, the offering
price would be reduced to $40 a share, Shamrock said.
   The $42-a-share offer values the company at roughly $2.6
billion, for 62 million shares, while the $40-a-share offer puts a
value on the company of nearly $2.9 billion, because it assumes the
existence of nearly 10 million more shares.
   About 5 million of the shares are already owned by Shamrock.
   Shamrock, which is owned by the family of Roy E. Disney, nephew
of the late animator Walt Disney, has filed a lawsuit seeking to
overturn the ownershi plan. It is scheduled to go to trial in
Delaware Chancery Court on Oct. 19.
   Shamrock also said that if Polaroid's management agreed to
support a merger, the offer would be amended to increase the price
to $44 a share if the new stock issue was invalidated, or $42 a
share if it was not.
   In an effort to fend off hostile bidders, Polaroid has begun a
corporate restructuring, offering early retirement to hundreds of
employees.
   Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips issued a brief statement
asserting that the company ``has been making excellent progress
with its comprehensive strategic program designed to dramatically
improve profitability and deliver value to all of its
shareholders.''
   The statement added that ``we are proceeding with that plan,
but, of course, our board and management will consider the offer
from Shamrock and base their determination on the best interests of
all our shareholders.''
   Polaroid is incorporated in Delaware.
   The investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
along with Wertheim Schroder & Co., is providing financing for
Shamrock's takeover attempt.
   In addition, Shamrock said that commitments for $1 billion of
financing have been received from Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of
Nova Scotia.
