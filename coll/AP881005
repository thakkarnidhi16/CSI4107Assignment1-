<HEAD>Justice Department Goes To Court Against D.C. Plan To Bar New

   The Justice Department sought a temporary
restraining order Wednesday in an attempt to stop the District of
Columbia from barring newly sentenced prisoners from its
overcrowded jail facilities.
   The department filed suit in U.S. District Court after the
district failed to accept the federal government's offer of
short-term help to alleviate jail overcrowding in exchange for a
commitment by the district to quickly increase its space for
housing prisoners.
   The offer by Associate Attorney General Frank Keating would have
assigned to federal prison facilities up to 200 newly sentenced
people. That offer would have lasted until Oct. 14, and the city
would have resumed accepting prisoners Oct. 17. Under the offer,
the people temporarily housed in federal facilities from Oct. 4 to
Oct. 14 would have been returned to the district by Jan. 1.
   The city had until 3:30 p.m. Wednesday to accept the offer and
did not do so, said a statement issued by the Justice Department.
Federal prisons now hold nearly 2,000 city prisoners.
   The crisis was triggered last Thursday, when U.S. District Judge
William B. Bryant's ordered the Corrections Department to comply
with a court-ordered inmate cap at the jail. He gave the District a
five-day grace period before the decree took effect at noon Tuesday.
   An appeals court decision, handed down the same day as Bryant's
ruling, requires the Corrections Department to bring the population
at the overcrowded Central Facility at Lorton, Va. in line with a
court-ordered cap by Nov.1.
   The D.C. Department of Corrections closed its overcrowded prison
system to new inmates Tuesday to comply with the court order, and
placed responsibility for housing them in the hands of the attorney
general.
   In a six-page letter to Washington Mayor Marion Barry, Keating
said the pace of new prison construction in the District ``has been
totally inadequate.''
   ``The District has been unwilling to take the obvious emergency
measure of placing on vacant sites within the District the modular
facilities which other jurisdictions have used to provide quick
accommodations for excess prison populations,'' said Keating.
   The city submitted a report to Bryant on Wednesday morning
explaining its plan for reducing the jail population, a spokeswoman
for Bryant said.
   In addition to closing the prison system, the city announced
plans to release 350 inmates early, transfer 130 to penal
institutions in other states, and hire contractors to post bond for
some indigent inmates awaiting trial.
   District of Columbia and federal officials met for hours
Wednesday in an unsuccessful effort to resolve their differences.
   Meanwhile, the D.C. police department's traffic branch holding
cell was turned over to the Department of Corrections to house some
prisoners temporarily, according to police spokesman Joe Gentile.
And police station houses were placed on alert to prepare to accept
overflow prisoners.

<HEAD>Bentsen Says `I Did Fine' Against Quayle</HEAD>

   Lloyd Bentsen said he thought he ``did fine''
in Wednesday night's vice presidential debate, and that Republican
opponent Dan Quayle did not adequately explain what he would do if
he suddenly became president.
   Bentsen received a telephone call from Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis immediately after the debate, then left for
a rally at a nearby hotel.
   There, the Democratic vice presidential nominee was cheered by
700 supporters. A large sign declared, ``And the winner is
Bentsen.''
   Asked if he thought he had won the debate, Bentsen said, ``I
think I did fine, and I enjoyed it. I had fun. I think we made our
points.''
   Bentsen referred to the repeated questioning of Quayle about the
Republican vice presidential nominee's qualifications to assume the
presidency.
   ``I stood up there for 90 minutes listening to Senator Quayle
say what he was going to do if he was president of the United
States, and I still didn't know. Finally I realized all he was
going to do was go back to that script again,'' Bentsen said.
   Dukakis called Bentsen to wish him well before the debate. The
Democratic ticket planned a reunion Thursday at a steel plant rally
near Longview, Texas.
   Bentsen arrived in Omaha on Tuesday night after four days of
intense preparations, first in Washington and then in Austin,
Texas. He took time to spend with his wife and three children and
planned to work out in the hotel gym to help him relax before the
debate.
   B.A. Bentsen accompanied her husband to the private tour of the
debate site Wednesday afternoon. Afterward, according to press
secretary Mike McCurry, Bentsen, 67, picked up his wife and carried
her off the stage. ``She looked like she was willing to go with him
anywhere,'' he said.
   Much of his preparation was devoted to making Bentsen
comfortable with the format of the debate, which limited the
candidates to two-minute answers and one-minute responses, aides
said.
   ``It's a matter of taking the language of the U.S. Senate and
putting it in a form that's suitable for television,'' McCurry said.
   Although his advisers admitted helping Bentsen ``frame his
answers,'' McCurry said, ``we have not armed him with a lot of cute
one-liners. That's not really his style.''
   ``I think we'll leave the one-liners to Roger Ailes and Dan
Quayle,'' said Dukakis aide Leslie Dach, referring to the
Republican media strategist who has been coaching the GOP candidate.
   Bentsen and other Democrats have tried to exploit public
uneasiness about Quayle's qualifications for the job, and public
polls show Quayle is a drag on the Republican ticket. A strong
performance by the 41-year-old Quayle could turn that around.
   ``I don't think people are going to judge this just by the fact
he doesn't stumble,'' Dach said. He said Quayle needed ``an
extremely strong performance'' to overcome the public's doubts.

   Republicans declared that Dan Quayle exceeded
expectations in the vice presidential debate Wednesday night, while
Democrats said the confrontation demonstrated Lloyd Bentsen's
experience and qualifications for president.
   As expected, reaction to the 90-minute debate held in Omaha,
Neb., and broadcast nationally, was strongly partisan, with backers
of Republican George Bush praising Quayle's performance, and
supporters of Democrat Michael Dukakis, declaring Bentsen the
victor.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater described President
Reagan as ``gratified'' by the outcome and said the president
called Quayle to congratulate him.
   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois said, ``Neither scored a
knockout, but Lloyd Bentsen looked and sounded more presidential.''
   ``I don't think there's any question Quayle made himself an
asset to the ticket tonight,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, a national co-chairman of the George Bush campaign.
``Prior to tonight he was not.''
   Bentsen's jibe at Quayle when the Indiana senator compared his
experience to that of John F. Kennedy drew a mixed reaction.
   ``Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine,'' the Texas Democrat told
Quayle. ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
   ``That was uncalled for, senator,'' retorted Quayle.
   ``It threw a chill over the whole debate, a sour note,'' said
Atlanta-based pollster Clairbourne Darden. ``It changed from then
on, the way you looked at Lloyd Bentsen.''
   But Democrats said Quayle looked bad when he tried to compare
himself with Kennedy.
   ``I think Quayle's worst moment was when he tried to cpmpare
himself to Jack Kennedy,'' said Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston of
California.
   ``He (Quayle) was forced to think for himself and it didn't go
over,'' said Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.
   Steve Teichner, a California pollster, said he saw no clear
winner.
   ``Because of the low expectations for Quayle, the polls will
probably show that Quayle probably won,'' said Teichner. ``As for
whether the debate will help in the overall race, I think it's a
wash.''
   Merle Black, a political scientist at the University of North
Carolina, said, ``I think Bentsen did a better job. I think the
Dukakis ticket ought to be helped by his performance.''
   But he also praised Quayle who, he said, ``performed well enough
that the Bush campaign will not have to engage in extensive damage
control after tonight. But I think he was out-debated by Bentsen.''
   Nancy Neuman, president of the League of Women Voters, called
the debate a draw.
   ``I don't see that one outshone the other particularly,'' she
said. ``I think they came off pretty well as they intended. Whether
the voters won, I'm still trying to figure out.''

<HEAD>Haitian Merchants Block Dominican Consulate; Priest Applauds
Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ About 100 Haitian merchants blocked
the Dominican consulate Wednesday, claiming Dominican soldiers were
confiscating their goods, Radio Haiti-Inter reported.
   In another development, the Roman Catholic priest who escaped
injury when thugs massacred his parishioners three weeks ago made
his first public comment on the attack Wednesday and applauded the
Haitian soldiers' rebellion.
   The merchants, who in Haiti resell merchandise bought in the
Dominican Republic, claim the incidents occurred from Sept. 26 to
Oct. 1. Most of the incidents occurred at Barahona, a small town in
southwestern Dominican Republic near the Haitian border.
   The merchants claimed the Dominicans said it was ``a special
control'' measure ordered by Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer.
An unidentified witness alleged the soldiers pointed their rifles
at them and confiscated the goods to sell them.
   In a recorded radio address broadcast by local stations, the
Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide paid tribute to the 13 parishioners who
died and the more than 70 who were wounded Sept. 11 when men with
guns, machetes and metal skewers attacked his St. Jean Bosco church.
   ``Like Jesus Christ, the victims of the massacre of St. Jean
Bosco fell in a bloodbath of love for the liberation of their
country,'' Aristide said.
   Aristide, an advocate of Marxist liberation theology who has
been condemned by the church hierarchy, saluted ``the valiant
soldiers who have decided to continue the house-cleaning
operation.''
   But he did not praise Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, the country's new
leader, associating him with other officiers linked to the Duvalier
regimes of the past.
   ``The people do not trust you; (the people) should consider all
bigshot Duvalierists as big-time criminals until they prove the
contrary for the rest of their lives,'' he said in remarks
addressed to Avril.
   Rank-and-file soldiers of the Presidential Guard, upset by the
church massacre and other government-sponsored violence, overthrew
military ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy on Sept. 17 and sent him into
exile in the Dominican Republic. They named Avril as his successor
and accused Namphy and Port-au-Prince Mayor Mayor Franck Romain of
masterminding the massacre.
   The enlisted men ousted many of their unpopular commanding
officers in the week following the coup, while the general populace
hunted down, stoned to death and burned a number of Tonton Macoutes
believed responsible for the church massacre.
   The Macoutes are former members of the private militia of the
Duvalier family dictatorship that ruled Haiti for 29 years until
Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted and exiled in February 1986.
   Avril has been identified for years as a staunch Duvalierist and
became a multimillionaire as financial advisor to the dictator's
family.

   Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle said Wednesday night that he did ``great'' in his debate
with Lloyd Bentsen and said he was pleased at being grilled three
times about his qualifications for higher office.
   ``We were delighted that they brought it up three different
times because it gave us three different times to talk to the
American people about what I'll do for the country,'' Quayle said
as he left the Civic Auditorium where the debate was held and
headed toward a post-debate rally.
   Asked about his performance, Quayle smiled at reporters and
said, ``Great.''
   David Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman, said Quayle received
congratulatory calls after the debate from Vice President George
Bush, President Reagan and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole.
   He quoted Bush as telling his running mate, ``You did great.''
   ``Thank you very much,'' Quayle told Bush, according to Prosperi.
   At the rally at an outdoor park following the debate, Quayle
asked 2,000 flag-waving supporters, ``Did we win the debate?''
   They shouted back: ``Yes.''
   Referring to Wednesday's American League playoff game in which
the Oakland Athletics beat the Boston Red Sox 2-1, Quayle said,
``This afternoon, the team from Massachusetts lost, and tonight,
the man from Massachusetts lost.''
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis is governor of
Massachusetts.
   Quayle said Bentsen had made ``absolutely no response to the
fact that Michael Dukakis is simply out of step with mainstream
America.''
   ``After tonight, America has a little better picture of the road
that we want to take right into the 21st Century,'' Quayle said.
   As he was leaving the rally to head for his hotel room, Quayle
was asked by reporters about Bentsen's comment during the debate
that ``You're no Jack Kennedy.''
   ``It was uncalled for,'' Quayle said.
   Before the debate, Quayle, in a jocular mood, had admonished the
press to ``Watch us carefully. Take good notes. Good news stories
now.''
   ``I feel good,'' Quayle said as he left his hotel for the debate.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Indiana senator, wearing makeup for his
morning rehearsal before the cameras and tour of the Civic
Auditorium stage with his top aides, looked confident and relaxed.
   ``We're ready,'' Quayle told reporters as he emerged from his
hotel. Asked if he was nervous, Quayle replied, ``Not yet.''
   ``The mike works. That's very important to make sure the mike
works and ours is working well,' he said as he left the debate hall.
   As for Bentsen, his Democratic counterpart, Quayle joked, ``I
just hope he shows up.''
   Quayle had a low-key day as he prepared for the debate. He spent
the afternoon relaxing in his hotel room, except for a brief walk
outside.
   When reporters asked about his debate strategy, Quayle said,
``We don't want to give any strategies away.''
   But, he said: ``You're going to see Dan Quayle as he really is.
You're going to see the real Dan Quayle.''
   Quayle and his aides telegraphed his strategy days ago, saying
the focus would be on Dukakis rather than Bentsen, who the
Republicans say is closer to them than the Democrats on many issues.
   ``Dukakis is running for president, and he's the one I'm very
concerned about becoming president,'' Quayle told reporters
Tuesday. ``It would be a very troubling notion for many Americans.''
   Quayle took part in two mock debates this week with Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., who played Bentsen, and has had dozens of issues
briefings. He said Packwood and his briefing team ``thought of
every tough question you could possibly think of'' during the
rehearsals.
   ``I gave brilliant answers,'' he said.

   Here are excerpts from Wednesday night's
debate between vice presidential candidates Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, and Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Question: Why do you think that you have not made a more
substantial impression on some of these people who have been able
to observe you up close?
   Quayle: ... Qualifications for the office of vice president or
president are not age alone ... Let's look at the three biggest
issues that are going to be confronting America in the next
presidency. Those three issues are national security and arms
control, jobs and education, and the federal budget deficit. On
each one of those issues I have more experience than does the
governor of Massachusetts. ...
   Bentsen: This debate tonight, is not about the qualifications
for the vice presidency. No, the debate tonight, is a debate about
the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be
made by you. The stakes could not be higher.
   Question: If you had to step in to the presidency, who's agenda
would you pursue? Yours, or (Dukakis')?
   Bentsen: ... We agree on so many things, and the vast majority
of the issues. We agree on the fact that we have to cut this
deficit ... Governor Dukakis and I agree that we ought to have a
trade policy for this country, that we've seen this administration
more than double the national debt, that they've moved this country
from the No. 1 lender nation in the world to the No. 1 debtor
nation in the world under their administration, that they have not
had a trade policy, that they've let trade be a handmaiden for the
foreign policy objectives of the country, that this country has
exported too many jobs and not enough products. ...
   Quayle: ... Governor Dukakis, one of the most liberal governors
in the United States of America, ... raised taxes five times. He
just raised taxes this last year, and that's why a lot of people
refer to him ``Tax Hike Mike.'' That's why they refer to the state
of Massachusetts as Taxachusetts. ...
   Question: ... Aren't you and Gov. Dukakis using (Social
Security) politically, rather than dealing with it responsibily?
   Bentsen: ... We have a contract with the American people on
Social Security, and Social Security is an issue where Sen. Quayle
voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security. ... Now,
when you talk about Social Security the people that are going to
protect it are the Democrats who brought forth that program. ...
   Quayle: Sen. Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social
Security benefits eight times. What I have voted for, and what Sen.
Bentsen has voted for, is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.
... You're right, they use this for political advantage. What they
try to do time and time again is to scare the old people of this
country. ...
   Question: ... Do you consider yourself an environmentalist? And,
if you do, how do you reconcile that with your voting record?
   Quayle: I have a very strong record on the environment in the
United States Senate. ... I have voted for the major pieces of
environmental legislation that have come down and been voted on in
the United States Senate. ... If you bring up the environment, you
can't help but think about the environmental policy of the governor
of Massachsetts. ... The Boston Harbor which is the dirtiest
waterway in America. ... What has the governor of Massachusetts
done about that? Virtually nothing. ...
   Bentsen: ... We're the authors, the Democratic Party, of Clean
Air, of Clean Water, of the Superfunding. I'm one who played a very
major role in passing the Superfund legislation. And every
environmental organization that I know, every major one has now
endorsed the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. ...
   Question: I'd like for you to ... explain ... your votes against
the school breakfast program, the school lunch program and the
expansion of the child immunization program.
   Quayle: ... I have a very good record and a commitment to the
poor, to those that don't have a family, want to have a family.
This administration and a George Bush administration will be
committed to eradicating poverty. ... The poverty program we are
going to concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities so that
everyone will have the opportunities that they want.
   Bentsen: ... What also frustrates me ... is the kind of votes
he's cast against child nutrition programs, the fact that he has
voted against money that we needed for further immunization, the
denial of polio shots to kids where the parents couldn't afford to
get that kind of a shot. Now I don't really believe that is
identifying with the concerns of people in poverty.
   Question: ... You and Michael Dukakis seem to be diametrically
opposed on (Contra aid).
   Bentsen: Gov. Dukakis and I have disagreed on the Contra program
... But my big difference with this administration is they look at
the Contra aid program as the only way to resolve that problem. ...
I believe that you have to work with the leaders of those other
Central American countries to try to bring about the
democratization of Nicaragua ...
   Quayle: There's no doubt, in a Dukakis administration that the
aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in Nicaragua and
that is unfortunate. ...
   Question: Governor Dukakis has tried to make ethics a major
issue in the campaign. And he has you as a running mate, a man who
leads the league, at last count, in the receipt of PAC money ... Do
you find that embarrassing, Senator?
   Bentsen: No, I don't ... Wwhat I've done in PAC money is just
what my opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign. ... So
what you have to do is comply with the laws as they are ... I have
been for campaign reform and have pushed it very hard. ... But I've
noticed that the senator from Indiana has opposed that campaign
reform and voted repeatedly against it. ...
   Quayle: Senator Bentsen is the number one PAC raiser. As a
matter of fact, he used to have a $10,000 Breakfast Club. ... It
only cost high-paid lobbyist special interests in Washington to
come down and have breakfast with the chairman of the Senate
Finance Committe _ the one that oversees all the tax loopholes in
the tax code _ $10,000. I'm sure they weren't paying to have Corn
Flakes.

   George Bush praised running mate Dan
Quayle's performance in the nationally televised debate Wednesday
night with rival Lloyd Bentsen, saying Quayle hit a ``home run'' on
his first answer.
   ``He's doing good, good opening, strong opening, right out of
the ball park, the Canseco of American politics,'' Bush told
reporters, referring to Oakland A's baseball player Jose Canseco.
``He hit it the first answer, home run.,''
   Asked if the question to Quayle _ a Republican senator from
Indiana _ on criticisms of his qualifications was a fair one, Bush
replied, ``Everything's fair in this business. ... I'd like to get
a slow ball like that in the first one. It's easy.''
   After the debate, Bush called Quayle to congratulate him,
according to David Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman.
   He quoted Bush as telling his running mate, ``You did great.''
   ``Thank you very much,'' Quayle told Bush, according to Prosperi.
   The vice president, who had arrived at his hotel here in time to
watch Quayle take on Bentsen, a Democratic senator from Texas, had
invited reporters to watch the first question with him.
   ``Deja vu ... same podiums we used,'' Bush commented, referring
to his debate with Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis,
the governor of Massachusetts.
   His concern with staging was evident as he commented on Quayle's
position when he shook hands with Bentsen. ``Full-faced, looks
good,'' he said, then added, laughing, ``Full-face, turn, it's a
very important thing.''
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush had taken some time out from campaigning
to telephone Quayle and wish him well in the debate, according to
Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller.
   During the 10-minute conversation, Bush told Quayle, ``Relax, I
know it will go well.''

<HEAD>Debate Panel Calls Bentsen Winner Over Quayle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Associated Press panel of veteran debate
judges called Lloyd Bentsen the winner by a wide margin over Dan
Quayle in their vice presidential debate Wednesday night. An
instant ABC News poll also gave the victory to the Democratic
nominee.
   ABC News polled 637 registered voters immediately after the
debate. Fifty-one percent said Bentsen had won, 27 called Quayle
the winner and 22 percent said it was a tie.
   The debate also swayed some undecided voters over to the
Democratic ticket.
   In a survey prior to the debate, 50 percent said they favored
George Bush while 45 percent picked Michael Dukakis and 5 percent
were undecided. After the debate, the same people favored Bush with
50 percent, Dukakis received 48 percent and 2 percent were unsure.
   Eighty-seven percent said Bentsen was qualified to become
president, 12 percent said he wasn't and 1 percent was undecided.
Asked whether Quayle was qualified to assume the presidency, 48
percent said yes, 49 percent said no and 3 percent were undecided.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percent.
   The AP panel of six debate judges, unanimous in calling Bentsen
the winner, scored the contest 148-125 for the Texas senator. Some
panel members pointed to Bentsen's statement that Quayle was ``no
Jack Kennedy'' as the turning point of the debate.
   Melissa Maxcy Wade, the director of forensics at Emory
University in Atlanta, scored it 24-22 for Bentsen. ``I thought
Quayle really held his own until we got to the John Kennedy
question,'' she said. ``It was like a father putting down a child.
I thought the momentum turned then.''
   ``Up to that point Bentsen had not answered the breakfast club
questions well. But after that, it was almost like he got more
confidence,'' said Wade. ``It was almost like the John Kennedy
question fueled Bentsen for the rest of the debate.''
   James J. Unger, director of the National Forensics Institute at
American University in Washington and chairman of the AP panel,
picked Bentsen 25-17. He said, ``Quayle generally lived down to his
expectations. Bentsen lived up to and even above his. In fact,
Bentsen made a better case for Mike Dukakis than Mike Dukakis has.''
   James M. Copeland, national executive secretary of the National
Forensic League in Ripon, Wis., said itwas the best of any of the
presidential or vice-presidential debates since 1976.
   Copeland, who scored it 25-22 for Bentsen, said Quayle ``chose
to ignore questions that were being asked and instead to attack
Dukakis and to bring in political themes of his own choosing.'' He
said some of Quayle's ``slash-and-burn attacks were reminiscent of
Sen. (Bob) Dole'' in the 1976 vice presidential debate against
Walter Mondale.
   Copeland said Bentsen, with his ``very avuncular manner,'' stuck
closer to the debate format. But he added that the panel of
reporters also gave Quayle ``as harsh a grilling as I have ever
seen.''
   Steven P. Mancuso, director of intercollegiate forensics for the
University of Michigan, scored it 23-20 for Bentsen. ``I felt Dan
Quayle failed to answer the question that was asked him three times
about what he would do if he had to assume the presidency,'' said
Mancuso.
   William Southworth, director of forensics and professor of
speech at the University of Redlands, Calif., scored it 26-24 for
Bentsen, but said, ``I thought Bentsen won a large majority of the
issues, but I'm not convinced he will come out looking as if he
did.'' He said he was not sure how viewers will take Bentsen's
Kennedy crack.
   Donn Parson, director of graduate study in the University of
Kansas' Department of Communication Studies, rated Bentsen a 25-20
winner. ``The difference was Quayle's inability to cite
specifics,'' said Parson. ``One of the best examples was on the
environment. He answered by saying Bush will take on the problem.''
   In the Sept. 25 debate between Michael Dukakis and George Bush,
the AP panel picked Dukakis as a narrow winner on points, 144-141.
   The judges watched the debate on television and used a scorecard
modeled after the one used in collegiate and scholastic debates.
   They awarded one to five points in each of six categories:
reasoning, evidence, organization, refutation, cross-examination
and presentation. A 1 was poor; 2 fair; 3 average; 4 excellent, and
5 superior.
   Each judge could award a maximum of 30 points. A perfect score
would have been 180.

<TEXT>
   Governments with a stake in the oil-rich
Persian Gulf should give urgent priority to the threat from mines,
Western military and diplomatic officials say.
   Even though there is a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, ``the
mines don't know there's a cease-fire,'' said U.S. Navy Capt. Jim
Miller.
   Miller, who has commanded the U.S. mine-sweeping contingent in
the gulf for the past few months, said Monday, ``They're out there,
cocked and ready to fire. If we don't deal with them on our terms,
we'll have to deal with them on theirs.''
   At least seven mines have been found in the Persian Gulf since
the truce went into effect 45 days ago, and military sources speak
of a ``statistical probability'' that a ship will hit one of the
explosives.
   American intelligence assessments say there are 150 to 200 mines
still in the gulf, concentrated in the north. Most are believed to
have been laid by Iran and some by Iraq, officers say, but neither
country has provided data on the locations.
   These officers have predicted that the problem will worsen as
winter storms cause more of the long-submerged explosives to break
loose and follow prevailing currents down the western coast of the
gulf.
   Military sources, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said the mines threaten not only shipping but the fishing industry,
underwater oil pipelines and children who sometimes find the
odd-looking globes washed up on beaches.
   Several coastal fishing dhows have been sunk or damaged by
mines. One source recalled that two Bahrain children were killed by
a mine last year, and said another was found recently in Qatar.
   Between 12 and 50 mines are known to have been sunk, unexploded,
by local naval units off the coast between Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates, one source said. ``If those aren't found and
destroyed, one of them bumping against a pipeline and exploding
could create an immense pollution problem,'' he said.
   Progress toward a coordinated effort to clear the mines is
impeded by political concerns within the six-member Gulf
Cooperation Council, the military and diplomatic sources said.
   The countries _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Oman _ remained nominally neutral during the war
but supported Iraq against non-Arab Iran.
   Now, say Western diplomats, the council states are reluctant to
undertake any action that either Baghdad or Tehran might interpret
as hostile. ``As long as the Geneva peace talks remain stalled,
nobody wants to do anything that could be seen as `anti-anybody,'
said one diplomat.
   The mine threat, one said, ``isn't something they're paying a
lot of attention to, and they're not likely to until things start
to go bang in the night.''
   Although council states privately welcomed the foreign warships
sent to the gulf last year to escort tankers, their presence
remains a touchy political issue and the governments might not
recognize the mine problem before anti-mine vessels leave the gulf,
one Western source said.
   There now are at least 16 foreign mine sweepers in the gulf
region, including six U.S., three British, two Italian, two French,
one Belgian, one Dutch and one or more Soviet.
   U.S. officers say there are no plans for the 30-year-old,
wooden-hulled American craft to leave and suggest some might remain
indefinitely.

   A 9-day-old baby taken from his mother's
hospital room last week has been found in the home of a woman
depressed following a recent miscarriage , police said.
   Ali Salah appeared to be in perfect health when he was found
Tuesday, polce said.
   Daniele Imbert, 43, and her common-law husband identified only
as Mr. Lazur were being held for questioning but were not
immediately charged.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she at
first claimed the boy was her own, but under questioning admitted
she had taken him from his mother's hospital room, three days after
his birth.
   The mother, Latifa Salah, reported that Ali disappeared last
Wednesday from his cradle in her room in the maternity ward at the
Grasse hospital while she was taking a shower.
   Witnesses reported seeing a woman who appeared to be in her 40s
carrying a baby out of the hospital at about that time, and police
distributed a composite sketch. Neighbors of Daniele Imbert spotted
the resemblance and alerted authorities.
   Police sources said the woman in custody had a miscarriage in
June, and wanted a child desperately.

<HEAD>Farmers' Share of Food Dollar Lowest in 75 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New government figures show that farmers last
year got the smallest portion of the food shopper's dollar since
the Agriculture Department began compiling such figures 75 years
ago.
   According to revised figures by the department's Economic
Research Service, the ``farm value'' of the retail cost of a market
basket of food sold in grocery stores in 1987 was 30 percent, down
for the third straight year from 35 percent in 1984.
   The farmer's share of the food dollar dropped to 32 percent in
1985 and to 31 percent in 1986.
   Earlier Agriculture Department estimates had put those readings
even lower: to 31 percent in 1985, 30 percent in 1986 and 29
percent in 1987.
   Department records show the farm share of each consumer food
dollar averaged 46 percent in 1913, when recordkeeping began. Until
the figure fell to 31 percent in 1986, the record low mark had been
32 percent in both 1932 and 1933 during the Depression. The high
was more than 50 percent in World War II and for a few years
thereafter.
   The market basket contains average quantities of domestically
produced food bought in grocery stores, excluding non-alcoholic
beverages, and fish and seafood.
   One reason for the slippage in the farm value of grocery items
has been a general weakening of prices for some raw commodities.
But the situation varies greatly from item to item. And it depends
on how much processing is involved.
   ``Only a slight amount of raw milk is lost, for example, as it
is handled and processed for sale in cartons to consumers,'' the
report said. ``Therefore, the farm value of the retail price per
half-gallon is just a little more than the price that milk
producers receive per half-gallon.''
   The report added: ``In contrast, nearly 2.4 pounds of live
animal are needed to yield one pound of Choice beef on the meat
counter. The payment the cattle producer receives for that large
quantity of live animal is the gross farm value in the price of one
pound of retail beef.''
   With the 1987 farm value of groceries at 30 cents of each
consumer food dollar, that means 70 cents went to non-farmers, the
people who buy, transport, process and sell food at wholesale and
retail.
   Each time the farmer's share declines, it means a greater
``farm-retail'' share for the others.
   Ralph Parlett, a food economist in the agency, says the trend to
a smaller share for farmers also is the result of a growing
consumer preference for a greater degree of processing in food.
   When the farmer's share of the food dollar was 45 cents to 49
cents in the early 1950s, there was less processing. People bought
raw food, took it home and cooked or preserved it. Now, Parlett
said in a recent telephone interview, supermarkets display the
latest in the processor's art.
   ``The products we have today aren't the same,'' he said.
``Microwave products are an example. We didn't have those at all a
few years ago.''
   Also, he said, the ``efficiencies of farmers have picked up,''
meaning that greater yields are resulting from the same acreages,
more meat from the same amount of feed.

   Fears of a decade ago that city sprawl might
consume farmland by the millions of acres annually have not
materialized, according to a new study by the Agriculture
Department.
   Marlow Vesterby and Douglas H. Brooks of the department's
Economic Research Service estimated that urban areas grew at the
rate of about 740,000 acres a year during the 1970s.
   ``Concern continues about the survival of farms in high-growth,
rural-urban fringe areas and about the adequacy of cropland for
future food and fiber production,'' they said in the latest issue
of Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``However, ERS calculations based
on aerial photographs show that urbanization of agricultural land
is not occurring as rapidly as previously thought.''
   In January 1981, just before the Carter administration left
office, a report by the National Agricultural Lands Study said new
intiatives were needed to protect farmland and to ensure that the
nation would have enough productive capacity.
   The study estimated that the United States was losing
agricultural land at the rate of about 3 million acres a year,
including about 1 million acres from the nation's cropland base.
   Other experts at the time questioned the study's figures as
misleading. They asserted that the United States was in no danger
of running out of cropland.
   The study also estimated that American farmers would have to
plant between 84 million and 143 million additional acres by the
year 2000 ``in order to meet anticipated domestic and foreign
demands for agricultural products.''

   The Agriculture Department says farmers soon
will be getting about $1.2 billion in cash payments for
participating in the Conservation Reserve Program.
   Milton Hertz, executive vice president of the department's
Commodity Credit Corp., said Tuesday the payments are rental fees
for land contracts signed in the 1986, 1987 and 1988 fiscal years.
   Under the program, farmers agree to take highly erodible
cropland from production for 10 years. In return, USDA helps pay
for planting the land with protective grass or trees and provides
annual rental payments over the 10-year contract period.
   The goal under the program is to take 40 million to 45 million
acres of highly erodible land from crop production by 1990. More
than 25.5 million acres have have been enrolled officially, and an
additional 3.4 million acres were offered by farmers in a recent
signup.

   Actress Raquel Welch has been
hospitalized, but she instructed hospital officials not to say why.
   ``Raquel Welch is here and that's the only information I can
verify,'' Diana Wilson, a spokeswoman for Sutter Memorial Hospital,
said Tuesday.
   Wilson, who declined to say when the actress was admitted, said
no additional information was being released ``per her (Miss
Welch's) request.''
   Sylvia Gold, a spokeswoman for the actress, did not immediately
respond to a request for information.
   Miss Welch, 48, appeared in such movies as ``Fantastic Voyage,''
``One Million Years B.C.'' and ``Myra Breckinridge'' in the 1960s
and early 1970s. More recently, she starred in the NBC made-for-TV
movie ``Right to Die.''

   A desert mansion under construction for
TV producer-turned-businessman Merv Griffin was heavily damaged by
fire, authorities said.
   Tuesday's blaze caused about $1 million in damage to the $1.75
million home, fire officials said. Its cause was not determined.
   The house, more than 100 miles east of Los Angeles near Palm
Springs, was 80 percent complete, ``and a little more than half of
it was destroyed,'' said Riverside County Fire Capt. Brenda Seabert.
   Griffin, who has numerous homes, is in the process of building
another one atop a mountain in Beverly Hills. In between house
building, he is attempting to buy the Resorts International
hotel-casino in Atlantic City, N.J., from New York developer Donald
Trump.
   Griffin, 63, taped his last ``Merv Griffin Show'' in September
1986, ending 24 years as a television talk show host. Later, he
created such TV shows as ``Wheel of Fortune'' before selling his TV
production company to the Coca-Cola Co. Fortune magazine has
estimated his worth at $300 million.

   Ms. Benny and Mrs. Janis, both only children of the legends,
opened the 25th season of the Omaha Women's Town Hall lecture
series with reminiscences of their youth.
   Ms. Benny said she grew up in Beverly Hills, attending public

moving to New York to start a career in modeling and acting.
   After failing to achieve much success, she said, she returned to
California, where rearing four children became her career. Ms.
Benny, who is divorced, now lectures on the evolution of comedy.
   Mrs. Janis, a graduate of the Chouinard Art Institute in Los

a reunion.
   Mrs. Reagan took the shy-looking youngsters by the hands Tuesday
while visiting other young heart patients at St. Francis Hospital.
   ``They speak perfect English, too,'' she said.
   The children had returned for their annual checkups at St.
Francis, where they underwent open heart surgery in 1983. Both
received a clean bill of health.
   Mrs. Reagan had learned about the children _ Lee Kil Woo, then
4, and Ahn Hi Sook, then 7 _ through the Rotary Club's Gift of Life
program while she was visiting Korea with her husband in November
1983.
   She arranged to bring them back on Air Force One, and has since
followed their progress. The youngsters were adopted by an American
couple four years ago and live in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   The Gift of Life program provides expenses for childrens' heart
surgery at participating U.S. hospitals.

<HEAD>`National Security' Kept Mishaps Secret at U.S. Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For three decades, serious mishaps at the
Savannah River nuclear weapons plant were kept secret for national
security reasons and in some cases not reported to Washington,
according to federal officials who are trying to change that
attitude.
   One senior Energy Department official has compared the approach
to safety at the Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C., to that
which led to the explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28,
1986.
   And one member of Congress says the facility, which has been
closed since August, should not be allowed to reopen until the
situation improves.
   An Energy Department spokesman, Will Callicott, said that since
the federal government began making atomic weapons in World War II,
``there has always been a mind set, a culture, that we are doing
work that is important for national security and perhaps that may
override any obligation toward public accountablility.
   ``People have historically not been sensitive to the importance
of disclosing things,'' Callicott said. ``Clearly, there is a lot
of information that did not make it up the chain to top management
here at headquarters.''
   Without a detailed review of the record, he said, it would be
impossible to determine exactly what information had reached
Washington and what had been released to the public.
   Energy Secretary John Herrington, since taking office in 1985,
``has given heightened attention to the area of environmental
safety and health,'' and for the first time placed these issues in
the hands of an assistant secretary, Callicott said.
   The Savannah River facility produces plutonium and tritium,
which are used in making nuclear weapons. It is run by E.I. du Pont
Nemours & Co. under contract from the Energy Department.
   A Du Pont inspector, G.C. Ridgely, wrote in a recently released
August 1985 memorandum that 30 ``reactor incidents of the greatest
significance'' occurred there. None, however, were as serious as
the May 1986 disaster at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, according
to congresssional aides.
   One of the most serious mishaps at Savannah River was the
melting in November 1970 of a rod used to start an atomic chain
reaction, causing radioactive contamination of an adjacent room. It
took 900 people three months to clean up the contamination,
according to the memo.
   ``Serious radiation exposure could have occurred because no
outside alarm existed'' and an ``alarm was ignored for two hours,''
the memo said.
   Last Friday, Energy Department officials said the department had
not been informed of the incidents, but on Monday senior department
spokesman C. Anson Franklin said those statements were incorrect
and that the incidents had been reported to the department's
regional office in Aiken.
   He said the information apparently had not been relayed to
headquarters in Washington from the regional office.
   The reactors at Savannah River were closed down after the most
recent incident, in August, and had been scheduled to reopen
Tuesday. But Energy Department officials assured members of
Congress last week that production would not resume until safety
was assured, possibly after 30 days to 45 days.
   ``If they restart those things without having briefed us and
without having convinced us they have solved the safety and health
issues, they will be in serious trouble in the Congress,'' said
Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.
   Synar, chairman of the Energy, Environment and Natural Resources
subcommittee of the Government Affairs Committee, held hearings on
the Savannah River facility last Friday.
   He reacted angrily Tuesday to assertions that national security
considerations ever justified keeping mishaps secret at Savannah
River.
   ``Just because they claim it is national security doesn't make
it national security,'' he said. ``I didn't know that the health
and safety of the workers and the surrounding citizens was a
national security issue.''
   Synar agreed that the department had an institutional problem,
but challenged assertions that Herrington had changed the situation.
   ``They have set up a system that rewards managers in the field
for keeping the lid on bad news,'' Synar said.
   ``I think that there are good people at the Energy Department
that want to make safety a priority,'' he said. ``That attitude
starts at the top. And I haven't seen it. It is very clear that
headquarters has not been supportive of that. There has not been a
system set up that made the operational or field offices
accountable.''
   The most blistering charge last week came from Richard
Starostecki, deputy assistant secretary for safety, health and
quality assurance, in a memorandum discussing the most recent
incident, a small power pulse in August.
   ``The issue was not whether the reactor was out of control; this
time it was not,'' Starostecki said in the memo, which was released
at a congressional hearing.
   ``The more serious issue deals with an institutional problem and
attitudes toward safety,'' Starostecki said.
   ``There are currently some managers within the department with
an attitude toward production reactor safety, which on the face
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program
prior to the Challenger accident,'' he said.

   America now has more than 245 million
residents thanks to strong immigration and an increase in the
natural growth of the U.S. population, the Census Bureau says.
   As of Jan. 1 the national population was 245,110,000, the bureau
said, up from 242,825,000 a year earlier.
   The largest part of the increase was from natural growth _ 1.7
million people. That resulted from 3.8 million births minus 2.1
million deaths.
   In addition there were an estimated 600,000 immigrant arrivals,
the bureau said.
   At 0.9 percent for the year, the overall increase is consistent
with long-term trends, the agency reported. The nation's population
has been growing at about 1 percent annually since about 1960.
   Births last year averaged 15.6 per 1,000 people, up from 15.4 in
1986 but below the 15.7 rate of 1985.
   While this is well above the all-time low of 14.5 recorded in
1976, there has been no consistent trend in recent years.
   Population experts note that the giant post World War II Baby
Boom generation currently has produced many women in their prime
childbearing ages, thus producing more potential mothers to raise
the birth rate.
   Even so, the birth rate is nowhere near the high rate set in the
wake of the World War II, when births climbed to a record 26.5 per
1,000 in 1947.
   Deaths occurred at a rate of 8.7 per 1,000 people, and have been
fluctuating in the 8.5 to 8.7 range since 1977 after declining from
9.4 in 1972.
   There were 2.5 net immigrants per 1,000 people, including an
allowance for illegal arrivals, the bureau said. That's down from
2.7 in 1986 and well below the 3.7 mark of 1980, highest since
World War II.
   The overall growth rate was 0.7 percent last year for whites and
1.5 percent for blacks, both down substantially since 1960.

<HEAD>Court Considers Whether All-White Jury Was Unfair to Black
Defendant</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court is deciding whether
excluding prospective jurors because of race violates a criminal
defendant's right to a jury representing a cross-section of the
community.
   The high court ruled in 1986 that racially motivated
disqualifications violate equal-protection provisions of the law.
   However, Chicago attorney Patricia Unsinn asked the justices
Tuesday to expand on that decision by ordering a new trial for
Frank D. Teague, a black man convicted of armed robbery and
attempted murder.
   An all-white jury found Teague guilty in August 1978 after a
Cook County prosecutor used all of his peremptory challenges _ the
disqualification of potential jurors without stating a reason _ to
exclude 10 blacks from the jury.
   The Supreme Court ruled on April 30, 1986, in a case called
Batson vs. Kentucky, that a defendant's right to equal protection
would be violated if prosecutors disqualified potential jurors
based on their race.
   It later held that the ruling does not apply to convicted
criminals who had exhausted direct appeals in state courts prior to
the announcement of the Batson decision.
   While the Batson ruling came too late to help Teague, his
attorney argued that the exclusion of blacks also violated her
client's Sixth Amendment right to a jury representing a
cross-section of the community.
   ``Because the prosecutor took affirmative action to destroy the
representative makeup of that jury, we did not get the protection
that the Sixth Amendment guarantees,'' Unsinn said.
   Assistant Illinois Attorney General David E. Bindi argued that
it is impossible to ensure a representative cross-section of the
community for every trial and said the fact that Teague's jury was
all white did not necessarily deny him a fair trial.
   ``Cross-sectionalism is not the litmus test of impartiality,''
Bindi said. ``To equate jury impartiality with some form of mix on
the jury ... is to take a dangerous step toward saying that juries
be filled by quotas.''
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in May 1987 that
past Supreme Court decisions make clear the fair cross-section
requirement of the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the jury
itself, but only to the pool of potential jurors from which the
jury is chosen.
   The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case sometime next
year.

   When Kenny Walters used 3,000 $1 bills
to pay the county taxes on his tool-rental business, he thought his
feelings were clear and the matter was closed.
   But Clear Creek County Treasurer Geraldine Thompson may have
upstaged Walters. She returned his change of $110 mostly in
nickels, dimes and pennies.
   ``I guess he was just trying to make a statement,'' said
Thompson. ``I just gave him all the change I could dish out. I
mean, turnabout is fair play.''
   Walters said he enjoyed Thompson's response to his ``silent
protest.'' He said he was trying to make a point when he paid his
$2,890 in taxes in person with an old gunpowder crate full of $1
bills.
   ``I don't mind paying my property taxes,'' said Walters. ``But
sometimes they (county officials) have a tendency not to realize
how much money they're taking from people.
   ``I only get to see $3,000 twice a year _ once when I borrow it
to pay my income taxes and once when I borrow to pay my property
taxes.''
   Thompson said she has known Walters for about seven years and
realized he has an ``ornery'' sense of humor. She said it could
have been worse:
   ``He could have undone the bundles and just thrown them at me.''

   At first, teacher Shirley Cooley wasn't
sure what her third grade students at Greenville Elementary School
could learn from a truckload of pumpkins.
   But her experiment turned out to be a lesson in entrepreneurship
for the youngsters.
   Ms. Cooley lent her class $100 to start their own business,
called the Pumpkin Patch. She then persuaded her brother-in-law,
orchard owner Joe Huber, to give the class more than 300 pumpkins.
   Ms. Cooley's loan covered the cost of paint and brushes, which
the children use to draw goblin faces on the pumpkins. The
youngsters then sold their handiwork back to Huber at $1.50 each.
He, in turn, sells them to the public.
   The students already have made enough to pay off their loan. Ms.
Cooley expects the class to turn a profit of about $500, which will
be used to pay for several field trips. Extra money will be given
to the school to purchase playground equipment, she said.
   ``At the beginning of the year, many of these kids had a
difficult time calculating the value of money and being able to
make the right change, but this project has really gotten through
to them,'' Ms. Cooley said.

   Basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian's long feud
with the NCAA is being refereed by the Supreme Court in a case
testing the collegiate organization's disciplinary authority.
   The court's decision could affect, among other things, the
National Collegiate Athletic Association's investigations into
alleged drug use by some athletes.
   The justices, who granted an NCAA appeal last February, were to
hear arguments in the case today. A decision is expected by July.
   Tarkanian, head coach at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas
since 1973, is trying to preserve the victory he won in lower
courts and avoid a two-year suspension for alleged NCAA violations.
   Following a 30-month investigation, NCAA officials said
Tarkanian arranged for a student to get a ``B'' grade without
attending class, provided free air fare to a student-athlete,
encouraged individuals to give the NCAA false information to impede
its probe, falsely certified UNLV's program as complying with NCAA
rules and failed to comport with high ethical standards.
   The Nevada Supreme Court ruled that Tarkanian was denied
due-process during the NCAA investigation that led to his
suspension. But to reach that conclusion, the state court had to
find that the NCAA, a private organization, acted with governmental
power.
   The justices' handling of that larger issue will affect coaches
and athletes at state-run NCAA member schools across the nation.
   Individuals and private organizations generally cannot violate
someone's constitutional rights. Only a government and its agents
can do that because the Constitution protects against governmental
_ not private _ wrongdoing.
   Courts call the concept the ``doctrine of state action.''
   The NCAA is a private organization representing nearly 1,000
colleges and universities.
   But in the Tarkanian case, the state court said the NCAA was
acting as a surrogate for UNLV, a state university.
   ``The right to discipline public employees is traditionally the
exclusive prerogative of the state,'' the Nevada court said. ``UNLV
cannot escape responsibility for disciplinary action against
employees by delegating that duty to a private entity.''
   Because the NCAA investigators were acting as agents of a state
school, the state court ruled, Tarkanian was entitled to more due
process _ more opportunities to be heard and more information about
the investigation.
   The NCAA, insisting its investigation was not ``state action,''
sought help from the nation's highest court.
   If the justices agree with the Nevada court, the NCAA will find
itself in a curious position. It will have to afford more
due-process rights to coaches and athletes at state-run schools
than those who work for or attend private schools.
   The UNLV program was placed on two years' probation in 1977 for
recruiting violations, and the NCAA that same year ordered the
school to suspend Tarkanian.
   His court fight staved off the suspension, and won him the right
to have the NCAA pay some of his legal fees.

<HEAD>Court Hears Case On Minority Role In Public Works Projects</HEAD>

   The power of states and local governments to
require minority participation in public works projects is being
explored by the Supreme Court in a key affirmative action dispute.
   The justices were to hear arguments today over a Richmond, Va.,
program that set aside 30 percent of the value of all municipal
building projects for minority participation. The court is expected
to decide by July whether the plan should be reinstated.
   The plan was challenged successfully in a lower court by J.A.
Croson Co., a building contractor.
   At stake could be similar set-aside plans established by most
states and some 190 local governments.
   The case also is attracting widespread attention because of what
it might foretell about the court's future approach to other forms
of affirmative action and alleged reverse discrimination.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy is participating in his first case
involving preferential treatment for minorities since joining the
court last February. He replaced Justice Lewis F. Powell, who often
cast the deciding vote on affirmative action issues in the closely
divided court.
   Set-aside programs also have caused some deep divisions and
seemingly contradictory views within the Reagan administration.
   President Reagan, for example, said in 1984 he favored
channeling billions of additional contract dollars to
minority-owned firms. And the administration generally has looked
upon public works set-asides more sympathetically than other
affirmative action quotas it sternly opposes.
   But the Justice Department, responding to an invitation from the
Supreme Court in a case similar to the Richmond dispute, challenged
the constitutionality of set-asides.
   The Richmond plan was declared unlawful in September 1987 by the
4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court said there is
insufficient evidence that Richmond city officials discriminated
against minority-owned businesses in the past.
   Also, the appeals court said the city's 30 percent quota
appeared to be a completely arbitrary figure that ``simply emerged
from the mists.''
   Richmond adopted the plan in 1983 to require that a prime
contractor on any city building project subcontract at least 30
percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least
one-half minority owned.
   The minorities named in the plan are blacks, Hispanics,
Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts.
   The 4th Circuit court, in invalidating the program, relied
heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court ruling that struck down an
affirmative action plan in Michigan designed to protect from
lay-offs the jobs of minority teachers with less seniority than
whites.
   The justices in that case said preferential treatment of
minorities must be narrowly tailored to avoid hurting whites. The
justices also restricted the power of employers to adopt
affirmative action programs when there has not been proof the
employers practiced past discrimination.
   But civil rights groups point to a 1980 Supreme Court ruling
that allows Congress to earmark 10 percent of federal public works
contracts for minority-controlled businesses.
   The court also has upheld other forms of affirmative action
programs in a string of recent decisions.
   Minorities make up about half of Richmond's population, and
minority-owned businesses received less than 1 percent of the value
of city contracts prior to adoption of the set-aside.
   The plan was challenged by J.A. Croson Co. after its bid _ the
only one submitted to install stainless steel urinals and water
closets at the city jail was rejected.
   City officials refused to award the contract even though Croson
said there was only one minority contractor that could help on that
project and Croson considered that company unqualified. Croson also
said the cost of the project would rise by $7,663 if the minority
contractor took part. The city then called for new bids.

<HEAD>Food Companies Deny Breaking International Guidelines On Baby
Formula</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two of the world's largest food distribution
companies have denied charges they failed to follow international
guildelines for marketing infant formula in Third World countries.
   Both the Swiss-based Nestle SA and American Home Products Corp.
responded quickly Tuesday when Action for Corporate Accountability
announced it was renewing a boycott against Nestle products and
extending it to American Home Products.
   Leaders of the Minnesota-based group engineered a seven-year
boycott against Nestle that ended in 1984 when the company agreed
to an infant formula marketing code worked out with the World
Health Organization and UNICEF, an arm of the United Nations.
   Boycott leaders said they were renewing their call for the
marketplace action because Nestle and American Home Products were
not abiding by the agreement.
   ``Nestle has worked diligently to ensure its marketing policies
follow WHO recommendations,'' company spokesman Thad M. Jackson
said in Washington. He said the guidelines allow companies to
provide free or reduced-price formula to hospitals in Third World
nations for babies who ``have to be fed breast-milk substitutes.''
   Carol Emerling, a spokewoman for American Home Products, said,
``This whole activity is based on allegations that we violate the
WHO code _ and we flat out deny it.
   ``The real issue is infant health,'' she said. ``Breast-feeding
is best for infants; we've always said that. But every infant who
is not receiving breast milk has the right to the best alternative
available. That alternative is a scientifically formulated infant
formula that is as close to breast milk as man can make it. And
that is what our infant formula products are.''
   Boycott leader Douglas A. Johnson, chairman of Action for
Corporate Accountability, contended at a news conference that
Nestle and American Home Products and _ to a lesser degree _ other
formula distributors are interpreting the guidelines in a way that
allows them to skirt the intent and encourage mothers who could
breast feed their babies to use formula instead.
   Although Johnson does not have a blanket objection to using
infant formula, he maintains it is wrong for manufacturers to
encourage its use in powdered form in Third World countries where
most mothers typically don't have the money, education and sanitary
facilities to mix it properly.
   The result, he argues, is that thousands of Third World babies
develop often fatal diseases because they drink from bottles with
understrength formula that either does not give them the nutrients
they need or infects them with various germs, or both.
   The fundamental issue is whether formula distributors
effectively get babies and their mothers hooked on formula within
days of birth by making their product available for free
distribution at hospitals and other birthing facilities.
   ``In the hands of the poor, the feeding-bottle often becomes a
passport to death for the young child,'' said Dr. R.K. Anand, a
pediatrician from Bombay, India, present at the news conference.
   The physician said his practice has convinced him of three
things: ``Bottle feeding continues to kill a large number of babies
in India and other developing countries. Even poor mothers can
produce enough breastmilk for their babies for at least the first
four months of life. Restraint on the aggressive marketing of
infant formula is essential.
   ``Otherwise,'' said Anand, ``more and more babies will be
displaced from their mother's breast by big business.''
   Janice Mantell, executive director of Action for Corporate
Accountability, estimated that about $6 billion in infant formula
is sold worldwide each year, half of it in developing countries.
She estimated Nestle has 40 percent to 50 percent of the market in
the Third World and American Home Products about 20 percent.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Congress split by economic and regional
differences has proven again that cleaning up air pollution from
vehicle tailpipes and industrial smokestacks remains the nation's
toughest environmental problem.
   Only once since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 has
Congress been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen the
basic law, and that occurred 11 years ago.
   Two years ago, environmentalists in the House and Senate renewed
the campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog, acid rain
caused by coal-burning factories and power plants and toxic fumes
from chemicals.
   On Tuesday, they tossed in the towel, vowing to try again next
year.
   ``There has not been sufficient willingness to compromise,''
said Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who spent much of 1988 trying
to put together a consensus on a clean air bill. ``As a result, we
will do nothing.''
   Mitchell, citing this summer's smog alerts around the country,
said the technology exists to control air pollution. ``All we lack
is the political will to do so.''
   Among those he cited as resisting compromise were the
environmental lobby and the two behemoths that would be most
affected by such legislation: electric utilities and the auto
industry, domestic and foreign.
   Sen. Robert Stafford, R-Vt., a veteran of clean air wars,
pointed his finger at Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
who held the Environment Committee's bill off the floor for 11
months while he pushed for concessions for West Virginia's coal.
   The bill's death left the nation with no new tools to combat the
ozone and carbon monoxide _ chiefly from vehicle emissions _ that
has grown to the point that upwards of 100 urban areas are
violating air quality standards designed to protect human health.
   Also left in the dust was any new plan to deal with toxic fumes
from chemical plants and the acid-rain chemicals produced by
coal-burning power plants and factories.
   Last month, Mitchell and Richard Trumka, president of the United
Mine Workers union, worked out an acid rain plan that favored West
Virginia's high sulfur coal industry and mandated the use of
expensive stack gas scrubbers by about two dozen large utilities.
   The proposal infuriated senators from Western states with
cleaner burning, low sulphur coal. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., threatened
to filibuster. The environmental lobby's Clean Air Coalition also
criticized the plan, saying that no bill was better than a weak one.
   Southern lawmakers were unhappy because the proposal would have
forced some of their power plants to install scrubbers to solve
what is generally seen in the Capitol as a problem of Midwest
utilities polluting the Northeast.
   For its part, the utilities' lobby, the Edison Electric
Institute, consistently said ``no'' to acid rain controls. It cited
scientific disagreements over the problem and said controls should
await development of clean-coal technology, which is expected to be
cheaper than scrubbers.
   Byrd issued a statement saying he was ``disappointed that a
compromise on acid rain could not be reached this year that would
both enhance the environment and protect the economies of
coal-producing states like West Virginia. ... I will continue to
work to resolve this issue.''
   The fight over acid rain was just part of the complicated
closed-door negotiations over the clean air bill.
   Another major factor in its demise was a proposal to help combat
urban pollution by forcing reluctant automakers to produce vehicles
with cleaner exhaust emissions.
   A key player in this area was Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who
represents an automaking district and who chairs the House Energy
and Commerce Committee.
   Dingell and clean-exhaust advocate Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
were unable to agree on new tailpipe standards, thus paralyzing the
committee and keeping a clean air bill off the House floor.
   Dingell and Waxman held no serious negotiations after August,
taking the position that the Senate should solve its acid rain
problems and send a clean air plan to the House.
   Mitchell and Dingell had even discussed a scenario under which
the Senate would pass the basic acid rain language, the House would
handle the urban pollution provisions and the two bodies would
accept each other's product.
   Matters never got to this point. Stafford said he and some other
pro-environment senators could have taken the Mitchell-Trumka plan
had Byrd agreed to support the anti-smog and toxic chemicals
sections.
   Byrd, however, declined to make this commitment, leaving
supporters of a strong bill unwilling to leave the question of
stricter tailpipe emissions to chance and eventual negotiations
with Dingell.
   Richard Ayres, chairman of the Clean Air Coalition, said the
environmental lobby was unwilling to support the Mitchell-Trumka
plan because ``we can't recommend an acid rain program unless it is
good.''

<TEXT>
   Supporters of a bill to impose tougher
restrictions on textile imports, after failing to override
President Reagan's veto, promise to renew their efforts when
Congress returns next year.
   ``We'll be back,'' Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said Tuesday
after the House voted 272-152 to override Reagan's veto but fell 11
votes short of the two-thirds needed to enact the measure over his
objections.
   The action appeared to close the book on the battle for textile
legislation this year, with two weeks at most remaining before
lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time.
   The bill, designed to protect American industry from foreign
competition, would freeze current textile and apparel imports at
1987 levels and limit future increases to 1 percent annually. The
same would apply to non-rubber footwear except that no future
growth would be allowed.
   Countries that increase their purchases of U.S. farm goods would
get larger shares of the U.S. textiles market. A pilot program
would be established, allowing the government to auction off import
licenses. A special quota would be created for imported silk
neckties.
   Reagan vetoed the measure Sept. 28, saying it represented
``protectionism at its worst'' and would not only narrow consumer
choices but inhibit trade and cost America overseas sales. Sponsors
said it would save American jobs now in jeopardy because of a wave
of Asian textiles and apparel crowding U.S. merchandise out of
stores.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, lobbied furiously for the
override and sponsors said they were close to two-thirds at one
point. ``But we had some guys we just couldn't pull across,'' said
Rep. W.G. Hefner, D-N.C.
   ``Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' Hollings said in a statement.
He claimed the bill was similar to provisions endorsed by Reagan
several years ago before the president became critical of ``this
protectionism nonsense.''
   ``The failure to override the veto means that the next Congress
or the next administration must act to restructure our current
inefficient textile policy,'' Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said
after the vote.
   Textile and apparel workers bused in for the occasion from
various East Coast cities held a flag-waving rally on the steps of
the Capitol at noon, chanting, ``Save our jobs, save our jobs.''
Some then watched glumly from the House galleries as the
legislation met its doom.
   Critics portrayed the measure as guaranteed to spur price
increases that would amount to a fresh tax on consumers.
   ``Stand up for consumers, stand up for America, support your
president's veto,'' urged Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn.
   Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., another of the bill's fiercest
critics, said ``it imposes a tax on consumers of about $20 billion
a year.''
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., sometimes said to occupy ``the textile
seat'' on the House Ways and Means Committee, scoffed at the notion
of new price hikes under the bill and added that import curbs are
common in Asian countries.
   ``They have quotas all over Asia,'' Jenkins said.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, whose home-state shoe factories
have been hammered by imports, urged lawmakers to ignore ``the
ideological rot of an obsolete free-trade policy'' and approve
``this sensible trade bill.''
   A number of lawmakers alluded to upcoming elections and
political pressures arising from the bill.
   If the House ``were to do this by secret ballot, there would be
no doubt about the outcome,'' said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y. ``To
override the president's veto makes no sense. ... Open markets make
us all richer.''
   ``Don't be dissuaded by those who tell you that this is a great
political issue,'' said Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of
the House Ways and Means Committee. ``Bad economics doesn't make
for good politics.''
   Imports surged into the U.S. market in the early 1980s, and
Congress responded with a textile bill that Reagan vetoed on
similar grounds in December 1985. An override attempt failed in the
House in August 1986.
   The textile industry, already protected by 1,400 tariffs,
undertook a wave of modernization as a result and there were many
layoffs as aging plants closed and new ones were automated.
Earnings were up last year, and critics of the bill say the
industry is flourishing.
   But earnings fell 12 percent in the first quarter of this year
and layoffs have increased over the last 12 months.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Low Debate Expectations Could Work in Quayle's
Favor</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Call it the first one-man debate in
presidential campaign history: Dan Quayle versus Dan Quayle.
   Lloyd Bentsen will share the stage for tonight's vice
presidential debate, but it's clearly Quayle's show.
   If the polls are right, most Americans have a positive view of
Bentsen, the lanky, patrician senator from Texas. Few doubt his
qualifications to move up to the office of president, if that were
required.
   Quayle is quite another matter. Opinion polls say most Americans
have serious doubts about the youthful Indiana senator's
qualifications to be president.
   ``People are looking for him to get up there and stumble,'' said
Herb Mabry, a Democratic National Committee member from Georgia,
one of the few Southern states the Democratic ticket still is given
a fighting chance to carry in November.
   ``If Quayle comes across as a person who could lead the country,
it's going to make our job tougher,'' Mabry said.
   When the lights go up in Omaha, Neb., tonight, attention will be
riveted on Quayle. The fact that he is seen as far more likely to
blunder opens a greater opportunity for him to emerge a big winner.
   Will he fall on his face? Will he commit some verbal gaffe that
will dominate coverage of the debate? Can he survive 90 minutes in
front of a national audience of millions?
   No such questions are asked about Bentsen. Obviously, that's a
great danger for the Democratic ticket.
   Perhaps Quayle represents the ultimate political expectations
game, a candidate who can claim victory if he avoids embarrassing
himself, while his opponent goes on stage with the burden of being
portrayed as Mr. Senior Senator, a man who doesn't make mistakes.
   How will voters judge these two candidates? Will they score one
gaffe by Bentsen as the equal of three by Quayle?
   But the Omaha debate can be much more than an expectations game.
   In a sense, neither candidate wants to be seen as debating the
other. Each gains far more by establishing his own credentials, an
easier job for Bentsen than for Quayle.
   But that is the factor that moves the debate beyond the surface
expectations game of can Quayle survive 90 minutes without
stumbling.
   Dorothy English, executive director of the Arkansas Republican
Party, saw the debate as an opportunity for Quayle to ``settle in
the voters minds that he is vice presidential material. If he falls
on his face _ which we certainly do not expect _ then it would go
in the opposite direction.''
   As for Bentsen, Democratic pollster Peter Hart said ``I think
he's looking for two words to be said about him: solid and
competent. He's not debating Dan Quayle. He's in essence telling
you why a Dukakis administration makes sense and why a Bush
administration doesn't make sense.''
   Good advice to a candidate up against an opponent who could win
as long as he doesn't trip over his tongue.
   It may be enough for Quayle to come across to viewers as a
credible United States senator from Indiana, a man who sits across
the aisle from Bentsen, one who often is on the same side of issues
as the Texan.
   Certainly, one expectation is that Quayle will try to make just
that point during the debate, that he will point out his agreements
with Bentsen and the many areas of disagreement both have with
Dukakis.
   That might do it for Quayle. Or it might leave the lingering
question established in the minds of many voters in the weeks
immediately following Bush's decision to place the Indiana senator
on the GOP ticket.
   ``The larger and broader question about Quayle is left
unanswered,'' said Hart. That question is how does he perform ``if
you turn the keys of the free world over to him.''

<HEAD>Bush Campaign Targeting Moderate Democrats as Well as `Reagan
Democrats'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campaign strategists for George Bush
say they are trying to win the nation's most populous state by
pursuing not only the ``Reagan Democrats'' but also more moderate
Democrats who might be attracted to a ``future-oriented''
Republican candidate distinct from President Reagan.
   ``A number of swing voters are not Reagan Democrats,'' Steve
Merksamer, the Bush state campaign chairman, said in reference to
those Democrats who voted for Reagan in the past two elections.
``They are more moderate Democrats,'' who are ``not necessarily in
sinc'' with Reagan's conservative ideas.
   With a Democratic edge in the state's voter registration, the
Republicans must attract Democrats _ as they have in past elections
_ to win the state with the most electoral votes _ 47.
   Public opinion polls show the race virtually even, making
California a critical toss-up state. Its diverse economy and broad
demographic and social makeup makes California an expensive state
in which to campaign, but both candidates are making an all-out
push.
   The Bush campaign will devote most of its resources in the
coming weeks to winning swing voters and Democrats, said senior
campaign consultant Bill Lacy, who is heading the California
effort. He said the Bush forces are confident they have already
shored up their Republican support in the tight contest.
   In comments to reporters traveling with the campaign Tuesday,
Lacy and Merksamer refused to disclose projected budget figures for
the California effort.
   The moderate Democrats, many of whom live in the Sacramento
area, do not respond ``with the same emotional intensity'' to the
so-called value issues that are popular with the Democrats who
crossed party lines to give President Reagan his two general
election victories, said Merksamer.
   The campaign believes they are more likely to be swayed by
speeches like the one Bush made here Tuesday in which he proposed a
program to promote volunteer service by young people, he said.
   The proposal was aimed at showing Bush to be a strong leader
with ``future-oriented'' ideas, Lacy said.
   A TV ad attacking Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis for the pollution in Boston Harbor under his governorship
has played well in California, but the Bush campaign does not see
environmental concerns as decisive in the election, said Merksamer.
   He said it is primarily a coastal population that sees the
environment as a top issue, while voters inland are more concerned
about crime, taxes, and defense both from a foreign policy
perspective and an economic one since much of California's economy
is driven by defense contracting.
   Besides the Boston Harbor commercial, the campaign has been
running a ``crime quiz'' commercial attacking Dukakis, and positive
ads featuring excerpts from Bush's lively speech at the Republican
National Convention in August, and another ``feel-good'' ad
narrated by Bush's wife Barbara.

   Cuban authorities seized a U.S.-registered
yacht in Cuban waters and arrested its three crew members as they
were sailing from Florida to pick up a cocaine shipment in
Colombia, the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said.
   Prensa Latina, in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City on
Tuesday, quoted an Interior Ministry statement as saying coast
guard personnel seized the Rosendo Cardoso on Monday after the
yacht entered Cuban territorial waters.
   The ministry statement identified the three crew members as
German Cardoso Cruz, Juan Abreu Paez and Calixto Evelio Hidalgo
Diaz. It said all were ``of Cuban origin'' and that they left
Marathon, Fla., ``with the objective of receiving a shipment of
cocaine in Colombia.''
   Prensa Latina said the yacht and crew ``were put at the
disposition of competent authorities.''

<HEAD>Honduras Wants United Nations To Evict Nicaraguan Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honduras is calling for the creation of a
United Nations peace force to evacuate thousands of Nicaraguan
rebels based in Honduras and relocate them far from its borders.
   The Honduran proposal, unveiled Tuesday night by Foreign
Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras, also would apply to the
comparatively small number of leftist rebels from El Salvador who
operate out of Honduras.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Tuesday night he
had not seen Lopez Contreras' speech and had no comment.
   Nonetheless, the speech appeared to signal Honduras'
determination to end the tacit cooperation it has been providing to
the United States by allowing the anti-communist rebels to use
Honduras as a staging area for attacks against Nicaragua.
   Underscoring Lopez Contreras' apparent effort to disassociate
Honduras from U.S. policy was his description of the United States,
along with the Soviet Union, as a ``hegemonistic power.''
   Lopez Contreras called on U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to oversee the creation of a peace force comprised of
troops from Canada, Spain and West Germany.
   The force would guarantee the ``non-use'' of Honduran territory
by foreign insurgents, he said, adding that the proposed unit
should be authorized to use force, if necessary, to achieve its
objectives.
   The unit should locate the combatants in Nicaraguan and
Salvadoran territories, ``far away from Honduran borders,'' he
said. ``Their relocation in third countries should be carried out
from sites in Costa Rica and Guatemala. whose governments have
declared themselves neutral,'' he added.
   The proposal represents a revised and updated version of a plan
which the Hondurans set forth in November 1987. At the time,
however, there were relatively few Contras in the border era.
   Honduras, as a front-line state which shares a long border with
Nicaragua, has been a major pillar of American policy toward
Central America for more than six years. As a deterrent to
potential Nicaraguan aggression, the United States maintains about
1,200 troops in the country and has carried out numerous U.S.
military training missions there. Honduras also has been a major
recipient of U.S. economic aid.
   But Honduras always has been uneasy about the presence of the
U.S.-backed Contras along the border, fearing that the situation
could be used by the militarily powerful Sandinista government as
an excuse to invade Honduras. There have been numerous cross-border
incidents involving the two countries.
   The situation in the region has changed radically since
February, when the Congress rejected an administration proposal for
additional military aid to the Contras. Thousands of Contras have
fled across the border to the Honduran base camps where U.S.
foreign aid officials have been carrying out a large scale
humanitarian assistance program.
   Under an agreement the Contras signed with the Sandinistas in
March, the aid was to have been distributed to Contras in several
designated zones inside Nicaragua. But that plan was never
implemented, leaving many Contras no choice but to go to the border
area for sustenance.
   Honduras has watched these developments unfold with a deep sense
of unease, worried about the possibility that the Contras may
settle in the border area for an indefinite period.
   The rebels and the Sadinista government signed a temporary
cease-fire agreement on March 23 but have been unable to agree on a
lasting peace accord.

   Republican Dan Quayle, with two mock debates
and dozens of issues briefings behind him, says he'll ``just be
myself'' when he faces Democrat Lloyd Bentsen in tonight's
nationally broadcast confrontation between the vice presidential
candidates.
   With George Bush's media guru, Roger Ailes, and a host of top
campaign strategists at his side, Quayle arrived in Omaha Tuesday
night. He declined to tip his hand about debate strategy, saying
only, ``tune in and find out.''
   But it's no secret that Quayle will be on the attack against
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, not the Texas
senator, whom the Republicans portray as closer to them on the
issues than to the Democrats.
   ``Dukakis is running for president, and he's the one I'm very
concerned about becoming president. It would be a very troubling
notion for many Americans,'' Quayle told reporters on his campaign
plane en route to Omaha.
   Quayle plans a brief walk-through today of the Omaha Civic
Auditorium, scene of the debate.
   He sounded upbeat and appeared confident Tuesday as he chatted
with reporters in the first such on-the-record session he's had on
his plane.
   ``I'm going to just be myself,'' Quayle said. ``I will be
prepared to answer any and all questions.''
   Quayle said he sees the debate as ``an opportunity to
communicate with the American public in an unedited version.''
   ``They'll be able to see Dan Quayle as I really am,'' he said.
``The American people don't know me. They have a lot of questions
... They don't have any details of who Dan Quayle is.''
   Asked in what areas he was anticipating attacks from Bentsen,
Quayle replied, ``Everywhere.''
   Aides to George Bush were effusive Tuesday in their public
expressions of confidence in the Indiana senator, and denied that
they had tried to boost his odds going into the confrontation by
lowering expectations for his performance.
   ``We are very, very proud of you. We are very, very proud of the
job you are doing for this campaign, and we are very, very proud of
the job we know you're going to do ... in Omaha,'' Bush campaign
chairman James Baker said at a rally at campaign headquarters in
Washington, D.C.
   Quayle's tenure as Bush's running mate has been marked by
intense media scrutiny and controveries over his academic record,
military service and personal life. He has also committed a number
of gaffes and malapropisms during the campaign.
   GOP strategists have said that because Quayle has been portrayed
as a caricature and lightweight candidate he should benefit from
the low expectations for his performance. In essence, they suggest,
anything short of a major blunder will allow him to come away
looking good.
   But Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, said, ``We haven't
done anything at all about lowering expectations.''
   ``I think he'll do fine on all the issues,'' Atwater said.
   Quayle has had two 90-minute mock debates, Saturday and Monday
night, with Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who played Bentsen during
the debate preparation. His aides have been conducting briefings
along with question-and-answer sessions since last week.
   David Prosperi, Quayle's spokesman, said much of the area they
had focused on involved attacks that were anticipated from Bentsen.
   Polls have indicated that voters have doubts about Quayle's
qualifications, but Prosperi resisted suggestions that tonight's
debate could have a critical effect on the election.
   ``This is only part of the campaign. There's a continuous debate
every day and there will be until Nov. 8,'' he said. ``The debate
will be an important part of it, but it's not the end-all.''

   Michael Dukakis returned home to catch up on
gubernatorial duties after courting crucial voters in the
industrial Midwest with a promise of a White House that cares about
the plight of struggling families.
   ``I care about working people and working families and that's
the difference between Mike Dukakis and George Bush and Democrats
and Republicans,'' the Democratic presidential nominee told a rally
Tuesday afternoon in Toledo, Ohio. ``We care.''
   Dukakis was in Toledo to tour its Jeep assembly plant, where he
received a warm welcome from its union workers. Earlier he
addressed students and faculty at Northwestern University in
Illinois, and he ended his campaign day by attending two private
receptions in Washington, D.C., with Democratic Party luminaries.
   Dukakis was spending most of today at the Massachusetts
Statehouse and was scheduled to meet with reporters this afternoon.
He also was attending a rally with supporters after tonight's vice
presidential debate between Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and Republican
Dan Quayle.
   Because of the focus on the space shuttle mission and the vice
presidential debate, Dukakis offered no new proposals this week but
sought to bring together his initiatives under the umbrella issue
of restoring U.S. dominance in the world marketplace. He also
underscored the theme of his campaign's largest advertising effort
_ a four-ad series portraying Bush as a product of media handlers
who has presented no viable solutions to the nation's problems.
   ``He offers slogans and symbols; we offer solutions,'' Dukakis
said. ``This nation didn't become the greatest on earth because we
were satisfied with the status quo.''
   Dukakis also repeatedly likened this year's race to the
Kennedy-Nixon contest of 1960, at one point comparing Bush's
tactics to those of Richard M. Nixon in the race 28 years ago.
   ``They said the same thing about Jack Kennedy in 1960 _ all that
gloom and doom,'' Dukakis said. ``And what was he saying? `We can
do better.'''
   Dukakis aides, while conceding they still trail Bush, have said
privately in the past two days that some of Bush's support appears
to be waning and that Dukakis hopes to attract the growing number
of undecided voters in the campaign's final five weeks.
   ``The stakes are very high and the race is geting even closer,''
Dukakis told his Ohio audience.
   In the Illinois speech, Dukakis delivered a sharply worded
attack on Bush and said his rival was running from ``a record of
failure and walking away from every major challenge he has faced.''
   He told the college audience that he and Bentsen would restore
America's leadership in the world economy through innovative
business and labor partnerships at home and a tough trade stance
abroad.
   Dukakis said Bush was trying to pin the ``gloom and doom'' label
on Democrats because he had no answers to the trade and budget
deficits and the decline of research and development in the United
States.
   ``Cite these facts and George Bush will tell you that you're
downgrading America, the same thing Richard Nixon did in 1960 when
John Kennedy was telling us to look to a new frontier,'' Dukakis
said. ``My friends, if we disregard these facts we endanger
America.''
   He also boasted: ``I'm running for president on my record. Mr.
Bush is running away from his _ a record of failure and walking
away from every major challenge he has faced.''
   There were no new proposals in the speech. Dukakis repeated his
familiar call for business-labor partnerships, tough enforcement of
the new trade law, reduction of the trade and budget deficits and
``some reasonable limits on the merger and acquisition binge that
continues to sweep this country.''

<HEAD>PTL To Sell Assets To Canadian Businessman</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, `Bakker was ...' with 2 grafs to UPDATE with
comment from Bakker.</NOTE>

   PTL announced Tuesday it had negotiated a
sale of its assets for $115 million to a Canadian businessman, a
month after PTL founder Jim Bakker failed in his efforts to return
to the helm of his television ministry.
   Stephen R. Mernick, 34, of Toronto, will pay $50 million at
closing under terms of the deal and pay the balance over five
years, according to a statement handed out prior to a news
conference by a Mernick spokesman.
   Mernick has interests in real estate, clothing, garbage
collection and landfills, the statement said.
   PTL has been under the supervision of U.S. Bankruptcy Court
Judge Rufus Reynolds, who told PTL trustee M.L. ``Red'' Benton that
a buyer must be found by Oct. 14 or he would order the assets sold
to pay creditors. The ministry is estimated to owe more than $130
million.
   Mernick was not at Tuesday's news conference. An Orthodox Jew,
he was in Toronto and didn't travel to Charlotte because Tuesday
was the Jewish holiday of Simhat Torah.
   ``His primary interest as a businessman is to get the maximum
return on his investment,'' Charlotte attorney Joseph Kluttz said
at a news conference.
   PTL's property, mostly in Fort Mill, S.C., includes a television
studio, a hotel and shopping center, a campground, amusement park
and a church. Private housing also has been developed on the
property.
   Bakker, who resigned as head of PTL last year after admitting to
adultery, made a $172 million offer last month for the ministry but
couldn't raise the money.
   ``Tammy and I remain committed to the restoration of the
ministry of PTL,'' Bakker said in a statement through his attorney.
``If the present offer is agreeable to the creditors, the partners
and the court, and God's will is satisfied with the respect to the
ministry of PTL, we will be happy with that outcome.''
   Kluttz said the contract was signed with Benton on Monday after
about three weeks of negotiations.
   Benton also did not attend the news conference. But Kluttz
distributed a statement from Benton saying he would recommend
approval of the bid to Reynolds later this week.
   PTL's religious functions have been separated from its other
operations, and Heritage USA Church is leasing back its facilities
from PTL to continue on-site worship and Christian TV show
production.
   In a Sept. 15 letter to Benton, Mernick wrote: ``While I am not
a Christian, I have a great deal of respect for the depth of the
religious feeling of the many thousands of Christians that have
supported the Heritage Ministry over the years.''
   Mernick cautioned that he could not commit himself on the
ultimate disposition of the property, but left the door open to
keeping at least some of the property as a religious park.
   PTL filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
bankruptcy code in June 1987. Three months earlier, Bakker quit the
ministry after admitting he had a sexual encounter with church
secretary Jessica Hahn. Charges of mismanagement and grossly
inflated salaries for the Bakkers and top aides resulted in an IRS
investigation of PTL and a lawsuit by the ministry to recover $52
million from the Bakkers and their chief assistant.
   PTL's trustee also considered a bid for $113 million from
Canadian real estate executive Peter Thomas. Benton said last week
that another group of investors from New York and Washington also
were interested in the property.
   A hearing on Oct. 17, at which the judge is expected to hear
arguments from creditors seeking liquidation of the assets, has
been set in Columbia.
   At Heritage USA, the PTL complex in Fort Mill, staff members
said they knew little about the new owner or his plans but were
relieved a deal had been struck.
   ``Most of the staff here right now, his name is just being
filtered down. Until more information is disseminated through the
news media, I think the initial reaction from the staff is going to
be `Who?''' said Jerry Knode, retail director for Heritage USA.
   ``But I think there's going to be a real sigh of relief that
everything has come to a conclusion. All of us have been through
the wringer, and we're glad the ringer has stopped.''

<TEXT>
   Michael S. Dukakis is fighting in court for the
rights of governors to veto federally issued training assignments
for the National Guard, a position that a U.S. attorney said was a
``dagger aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   In a hearing Tuesday in federal appeals court, Massachusetts
Attorney General Douglas Wilkins argued that governors have a right
under the ``militia clause'' of the Constitution to veto National
Guard training assignments.
   John Bolton, head of the U.S. Justice Department's civil
division, said ``this is a political case'' and warned that
Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, might regret a victory if
elected president.
   ``The view from Washington is very different from the view from
Boston,'' Bolton said. If each of the 50 governors were allowed to
opt out of controversial training assignments, he said, ``you end
up with potential chaos.''
   Bolton said the state's position amounted to ``a dagger aimed at
the heart of national defense.''
   The issue began when federal authorities ordered 13 public
relations specialists from the Massachusetts National Guard to
train in Honduras and Panama in May and June. Dukakis withheld his
consent and filed suit on Jan. 29 seeking to block the mission.
   However, the court upheld the authority of federal officials on
May 6 on the grounds that National Guard troops are sworn to
federal duty as well as state duty. The mission was carried out.
   The three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said it would review the arguments. Lawyers said it could take
months to issue a ruling.
   Afterward, Dukakis' Statehouse press secretary, James Dorsey,
said Dukakis was trying to uphold a principle endorsed by many
governors of both parties.
   ``There is a very important principle at stake here _ a 200-year
tradition of the states being responsible for the training of the
militia,'' Dorsey said.
   Asked if the Dukakis campaign was concerned that the governor's
position could be used against him in the presidential campaign to
portray Dukakis as ``soft'' on defense, Dorsey shot back: ``Who's
going to make that argument, Dan Quayle?''
   He was referring to Republican vice presidential nominee Dan
Quayle, who came under criticism for seeking a position in the
Indiana National Guard during the Vietnam War, a status that spared
him from combat duty.
   Bolton warned that if Massachusetts prevailed, it would ``permit
governors to interfere in sensitive foreign policy decisions.''
   Specifically, he said, the Constitution gave Congress the power
to enact the 1986 Montgomery Amendment, which prohibited governors
from objecting to National Guard assignments in peacetime unless
their states were facing an emergency such as a flood.
   The Massachusetts case is paralleled by a similar challenge
filed by Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, which was also rejected at
the district court level. The Minnesota case also is on appeal.

<HEAD>House Offers Limited Civil Rights for Its Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House for the first time is offering its
employees limited civil rights protection by establishing a
procedure for workers to contest sexual harassment or
discrimination.
   Supporters called the resolution, which was approved Tuesday on
a 408-12 vote, a first step toward ending the legislative hypocrisy
for which critics fault Congress _ passing laws to protect all
workers in the nation except its own.
   ``Discrimination is just as wrong in Congress as it is anywhere
else,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Rep. Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, predicted Congress would go
further in future years to extend to its workers the protections
offered in fair labor standards laws and by the Occupational Safety
and Health Act.
   The legislation covers only the 12,000 or so employees of the
House, so it takes effect without further action by the Senate or
the president. And because it is a resolution, not a change in the
law, it will have to be re-enacted next year to continue in force.
   Lawmakers voting against the measure were Reps. Bill Dickinson,
R-Ala., Robert Stump, R-Ariz., John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark.,
Robert Badham, R-Calif., Charles Pashayan, R-Calif., Larry Hopkins,
R-Ky., John Dingell, D-Mich., Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., Joseph Gaydos,
D-Pa., Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and Alan
Mollohan, D-W.Va.
   Not voting were Reps. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., Buddy MacKay,
D-Fla., Connie Mack, R-Fla., Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, Brian Donnelly,
D-Mass., Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, Jake Pickle,
D-Texas, Beau Boulter, R-Texas, Mack Sweeney, R-Texas, and Mike
Lowry, D-Wash.
   The change, based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sets up a
House Office of Fair Employment Practices to handle discrimination
complaints. Court interpretations of the law extend its protection
also to sexual harassment cases.
   The office will investigate discrimination charges and is
empowered to mediate cases, determine whether the charges are true
and specify remedies, including job reinstatement or promotion,
back pay and monetary compensation. Reprisals against employees who
complain to the office are prohibited.
   Among cases this year that gave impetus to the move:
   _Rep. Ernest Konnyu, R-Calif., got into political hot water
after reports that he made offensive comments to female staffers
regarding their physiques. In one case, he suggested that a woman
in his office wear high heels instead of flat shoes and instructed
her to turn around so he could see how she looked. Konnyu was
defeated in this year's GOP primary.
   _Tom Pappas, the top aide to Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., committed
suicide by leaping from a 24th-floor hotel room in New York after
The Washington Post reported unorthodox social demands he made of
male aides in Dyson's office.
   _Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., came in for criticism following
reports that he made sexually explicit comments to female aides and
in some cases embraced them so he would ``feel better.''
   Panetta noted that the House has resisted being placed under
regular workplace laws because it would put the executive branch in
the position of enforcing laws on Congress, which lawmakers see as
an infringement on the constitutional separation of powers.
   Panetta said the new rules will let the House police itself. The
new House procedure would permit lawmakers to continue to
discriminate among employees on the bases of geographical and
political preference, so they can choose workers from their home
districts and of their own parties.

   The Iraqi foreign minister complained of
Iranian searches of shipping on the Persian Gulf and insisted that
Iraq's outlet to the Persian Gulf be cleared for navigation before
the latest peace talks progress.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz met with U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar on Tuesday and then spoke to the U.N.
General Assembly.
   Afterward, he told reporters, ``We had a very constructive
exchange of views about the course of the negotiations, and he
(Perez de Cuellar) is going to see my Iranian counterpart.''
   Iraq and Iran renewed peace talks Saturday at U.N. headquarters
in New York after a session in Geneva from Aug. 25 to Sept. 13. The
talks followed a cease-fire Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old war, which
left at least 1 million killed or wounded.
   The statements made by both delegations during the weekend and
by Aziz on Tuesday gave no indication of substantial progress on
major issues.
   When asked Tuesday if Perez de Cuellar had introduced new
proposals to break the deadlock, Aziz answered:
   ``We are discussing all possible ideas, you see, on how to make
further progress, and the discussions went well with his
excellency'' the secretary-general.
   Perez de Cuellar has reportedly suggested that Iraq agree to
postpone discussion of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, its outlet to
the Persian Gulf, until later in the talks, and that Iran stop
searching neutral ships in the gulf.
   The two belligerents would then proceed to deal with exchange of
prisoners of war and withdrawal of troops.
   Aziz told delegates to the 43rd General Assembly that Iran
``accepted the (Security Council's peace proposal) resolution only
because of a crushing military defeat.
   ``This suspicious position on the part of the Iranian delegation
was followed by its insistence on provisions which impose a de
facto arms embargo on Iraq at sea,'' said Aziz. He was referring to
Iran's searches of neutral ships in the gulf.
   Iraq insists the Shatt-al-Arab waterway forming the southern
border between the two nations must be cleared of sunken ships and
silt accumulated during the war.
   ``Shatt-al-Arab is Iraq's only outlet to the high seas,'' Aziz
said Tuesday. He said navigation there must be addressed for ``the
peace to be durable, comprehensive and just.''
   But Aziz denied he was setting a precondition for peace talks,
calling such an interpretation ``a pure lie and deception.''
   Baghdad also says Iran's policy of searching neutral ships in
the gulf for war cargo bound for Iraq violates the cease-fire,
which calls for ending all military activity.
   Iran says it has the right as a nation at war to search ships
for war material bound for its enemy. It says the issue of
navigation on the Shatt-al-Arab should not be included in peace
talks.
   Aziz's speech was moved up at his request from its scheduled
time Friday to Tuesday evening so he could leave for Baghdad early.
Aziz did not explain his premature departure.
   On Saturday, Aziz met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati for direct talks, but the session soon shifted to indirect
talks. The secretary-general and his special mediator, Swedish U.N.
Ambassador Jan K. Eliasson, shuttled between the Iranian and Iraqi
delegations in separate rooms.

   The people who engineered a seven-year boycott
against the Nestle company to fight the promotion of infant formula
in Third World nations called on Tuesday for a renewal of the
protest on an even larger scale.
   Douglas A. Johnson, chairman of Action for Corporate
Accountability, called for a resumption of the boycott at a news
conference, arguing that Nestle has failed to live up to the
agreements it signed in 1984 that ended the original action.
   This time, said Johnson, the group is expanding the boycott to
American Home Products, which it said is the second largest
distributor of infant formula in developing nations.
   While urging an across-the-board boycott of the two companies'
products, protest leaders are asking their followers to focus on
two products from each company: Nestle's Taster' Choice Instant
Coffee and Carnation Coffee-mate Non-Diary Creamer, and American
Home Products' Anacin and Advil across-the-counter pain relievers.
   Action for Corporate Accountability accused both companies of
violating at least the spirit _ and by Johnson's interpretation,
also the letter _ of the World Health Organization and UNICEF Code
of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.
   The code _ which Nestle agreed to as a condition of ending the
earlier protest _ permits donations or sales of formula for
distribution to infants needing breast milk substitutes, and says
the formula may not be used for sales promotion.
   At issue is whether the formula distributors effectively cause
the babies to become hooked on formula within days of birth by
making their product available for free at hospitals and other
facilities.
   Johnson's group, based in Minneapolis, says it is immoral for
manufacturers to encourage the formula's use in powdered form in
Third World countries where most mothers don't have the money,
education or sanitary facilities to mix it properly.
   The group says that thousands of Third World babies drink from
bottles filled with drastically understrength formula that does not
give them the nutrients they need or infects them with germs.
   Boycott leaders said the companies' actions have undercut the
premise that mothers' milk is best, especially for Third World
babies. Representatives of both firms denied the assertion.
   Illness often occurs when the mothers take their babies home,
Dr. R.K. Anand, a pediatrician from Bombay, India, said at the news
conference.
   ``In the hands of the poor, the feeding bottle often becomes a
passport to death for the young child,'' said Anand.
   The physician said that bottle feeding kills large numbers of
babies in India and other developing countries.
   ``Even poor mothers can produce enough breastmilk for their
babies for at least the first four months of life,'' he said.
``Restraining on the aggressive marketing of infant formula is
essential.
   Janice Mantell, executive director of Action for Corporate
Accountability, estimated that about $6 billion in infant formula
is sold worldwide each year, half of it in developing countries.
She said Nestle has 40 percent to 50 percent of that $3 billion
market and American Home Products about 20 percent.
   Nestle, which is based in Switzerland, and the New York-based
American Home Products are huge conglomerates with extensive
holdings and product lines.
   Nestle's better known products, besides candy, include Libby's
canned vegetables and juices, Lean Cuisine diet food and the
Stouffer Hotel Co., which has more than two dozen hotels and
resorts in the United States.
   American Home sells Today Condoms, Preparation H, Dristan and
dozens of over-the-counter drugs, and food products ranging from
Chef Boyardee Pizzas to Jiffy Pop Popcorn.
   A Washington spokesman for Nestle, Thad Jackson, insisted that
the company is in ``total compliance'' with national and
international codes. He also denied that the company is dumping
infant formula in foreign hospitals and said it never gives the
product directly to mothers.
   ``We do not dump supplies in hospitals,'' said Jackson. ``We
only supply materials at their request, and in appropriate
amounts.''
   He said if the supplies requested by the hospitals for
distribution seems ``excessive then we contact the hospital.''
   Carol Emerling, a spokewoman for American Home Products, said,
``This whole activity is based on allegations that we violate the
WHO code _ and we flat out deny it.''
   Ms. Emerling said the company believes that breast-feeding is
best for infants.
   ``But every infant who is not receiving breast milk has the
right to the best alternative available. That alternative is a
scientifically formulated infant formula that is as close to breast
milk as man can make it. And that is what our infant formula
products are.''

<TEXT>
   Some patrons at the Russian Tea Room got lunch
on the house after a construction site problem forced evacuations
from the posh restaurant and nearby buildings, including Carnegie
Hall.
   The buildings were briefly evacuated Tuesday when a construction
crane began swaying as it hoisted an 8,000-pound concrete block
hundreds of feet in the air. The block was lowered and the crane
secured a short time later, authorities said.
   Chuck Snavely, a cellist with the Cincinnati Symphony in town to
play at Carnegie Hall, was eating lunch next door at the Russian
Tea Room when the evacuation was ordered. He got his chicken Kiev
on the house to make up for the inconvenience.
   ``I was ready for dessert when the waiter just came by and said
everybody had to leave the building,'' he said.
   Several other guests who had not yet paid for their meals also
got a free lunch, said Gregory Camillucci, the restaurant's general
manager.

<HEAD>State Governments Healthy Now, Vulnerable to Future Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State governments are vulnerable to new
financial strains in 1989, despite their success this year in
maintaining services without major tax increases, according to a
study by the National Governors Association.
   In its biannual survey, the governors said a drop next year in
federal aid could trigger economic problems for states, since their
budget surpluses are narrowing.
   ``These balances, if they hold as projected, are already at
their lowest point in the 12 years we have been producing the
survey,'' said Raymond G. Scheppach, the NGA's executive director.
   The survey released Tuesday showed revenue collections exceeded
expenditures in all three fiscal years studied.
   But the states are reporting steady growth in spending: up 6.3
percent in fiscal 1987, 6 percent the following year and an
estimated 6.8 percent in fiscal 1989.
   In the 1988 legislative session, 27 states passed tax laws, but
most involved minor changes to conform with the new federal tax
structure. The new tax laws were expected to yield less than an
additional $1 billion, with most of the money generated by motor
vehicle fuel tax increases.
   In general, state economies seem to be growing. While the
Northeast and Far West continue to enjoy solid growth, most states
elsewhere that were hurt by poor farm performances and a downturn
in energy prices seem to be making significant economic and
budgetary improvements.
   Here is an overview of the regions:
   _New England: The region enjoys the lowest unemployment rate and
highest personal income growth in the country. The positive
economic signs are manifested in the highest percentage increase in
state expenditures projected for fiscal 1989.
   _Mideast: Unemployment rates are lower than the national average
and increases in personal income are 1 percent higher than the
national average. General fund expenditures are slightly higher
than the aggregate figure for all states.
   _Great Lakes: The region's unemployment rate is higher than the
national average. In addition, the expected fiscal 1989
expenditures show the lowest growth rate in the country.
   _The Plains: These states have made a recovery from the economic
and budgetary doldrums of a few years ago. Since the March
governors' association survey, the unemployment rate dropped
dramatically from 5.5 percent to 4.2 percent. But the annual growth
in personal income also declined in the same period. The growth in
expenditures is slightly above the national average, with the
exception of North Dakota and Minnesota.
   _Southeast: Unemployment has declined and personal income has
risen since the March survey. But the fiscally troubled states of
Kentucky, Louisiana and West Virginia make an analysis of the
region's economy difficult.
   _Southwest: This region has the highest unemployment rate and
the second lowest percentage increase in personal income, in part
because of the oil bust in Texas, the state that dominates the area.
   _Rocky Mountain states: This area struggles to improve its
economic and fiscal health. Personal income growth is the lowest in
the nation, while unemployment is slightly above the national
average.
   _Far West: Growth here continues strong, with personal income
increasing at an average of 6.7 percent annually, led by Nevada
with a rise of 8.9 percent and Oregon at 7.2 percent. Unemployment
is very close to the national average.

   George Bush wants to tone down his attacks on
Democratic presidential rival Michael Dukakis, a top aide contends,
but Bush continues to sprinkle speeches with a hefty dose of
opponent bashing.
   Bush's chief of staff, Craig Fuller, told reporters on Tuesday
that the Republican presidential candidate wanted to get away from
the appearance of waging a negative rather than issue-oriented
campaign.
   ``He was uncomfortable with a perception forming that his is a
campaign that was not talking about issues as much, because he has
been talking about issues,'' said Fuller.
   He cited Bush's first campaign stop Tuesday as evidence of the
new approach.
   In a speech to the business-oriented Comstock Club of
Sacramento, Calif., Bush made barely a passing reference to
Dukakis. He proposed a $100 million program to encourage community
volunteer service by young people. A new foundation, chaired by the
president, would work with existing volunteer programs and act as a
clearinghouse to help get more youths involved in community service.
   Today's campaigning in Denver included remarks on a companion
topic _ what society can do for children and education.
   But after Tuesday's speech calling for a Youth Engaged in
Service to America program of voluntary charitable activity, Bush
went back to some familiar Dukakis one-liners.
   The barbs he delivered in his stump speech to a rowdy rally on
the steps of the Riverside County courthouse lacked a bit of the
sting that has characterized similar recent speeches.
   But he unveiled a new one-liner commenting on Dukakis' proposal
to reduce the deficit by beefing up Internal Revenue Service
collection of unpaid taxes.
   ``Politicians used to promise a chicken in every pot,'' he said.
``He promises a tax agent in every kitchen.''
   By the time he got to a late-afternoon rally in Albuquerque,
Bush was revved up for attack.
   Referring derisively to his opponent as ``the liberal governor
of Massachusetts,'' Bush said: ``I love calling him that. I love
it.''
   Dukakis, Bush said, ``doesn't even dare use the big `L' word''
anymore.
   He trotted out his environmental attack on Dukakis, ridiculing
the Democrat for making an environmental pitch in California when
he was the governor ``who wanted to dump the crud from
Massachusetts'' in a waste site offshore from New Jersey.
   Bush laced the negative comments into a speech in which he
portrayed himself as an environmentalist, ``in the mold of Teddy
Roosevelt,'' and a man concerned about education and crime and one
who wants to build a more caring nation.
   He noted Dukakis had proclaimed himself tough on crime.
   ``If you believe that, he's got some bottled water from the
Boston Harbor to sell you,'' Bush said in one of his favorite
references to the severe pollution in the governor's homestate
harbor.
   But Fuller maintained this week's agenda would be devoted to
more positive issue-based speeches.
   ``He would like his campaign to talk about issues ... and not be
caught up in an attack on his opponent,'' he said.
   That does not mean that Bush is going soft on Dukakis, said
Fuller, forecasting ``future speeches that draw sharp contrasts
between the two candidates.''
   Bush today was visiting Arapahoe High School where the
intinerary included a tour of the science lab and remarks at an
assembly where National Merit Scholarship finalists will be
recognized.
   Bush then was holding a rally at the 16th Street Mall before
heading off for a campaign stop in Oklahoma City.

   President Reagan signed intelligence
authorizations in 1984 and 1985 giving CIA agents broad
anti-terrorism powers that some administration officials saw as ``a
license to kill,'' according to a published report.
   The authorizations ``deemed'' as lawful any covert actions _
including potentially violent ones _ taken in ``good faith'' by
U.S. intelligence agents against terrorists, according to a report
in Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post.
   The language of the findings seemingly was ambiguous, the Post
said. Actions taken in good faith and as part of an approved
operation would be deemed lawful in advance, but also they ``must
be'' lawful, sources told the Post.
   The newspaper quoted a former White House official, whom it did
not identify, as saying the Reagan orders were a ``go-anywhere,
do-anything'' authority.
   The language of the findings caused disputes among
administration officials, the Post said, because actions that could
be authorized under the findings might conflict with earlier
presidential executive orders banning any direct or indirect
involvement of U.S. intelligence agents in assassinations.
   The Post quoted a source as saying the language was specifically
designed to ``circumvent the assassination ban'' and protect CIA
agents who might take part in foreign strike teams.
   White House spokesman Bob Hall told The Associated Press he knew
nothing about the findings late Tuesday night.
   The Post reported that unidentified White House officials said
Vice President George Bush would have been given a copy of or would
have had access to the findings.
   A Bush spokesman and Bush campaign chairman James Baker III, who
was White House chief of staff at the time Reagan signed the 1984
finding, had no comment, the Post said.
   Reagan signed the first finding on Nov. 13, 1984, shortly after
his landslide reelection victory, the report said, because U.S.
officials had become frustrated with car-bombings at U.S.
facilities and the taking of American hostages.
   Congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the
crucial language in the findings, the report said.
   The authorization was rescinded on April 10, 1985, a month after
a car bomb exploded, killing 80 people in Beirut near the residence
of a leader of one faction of Iranian fundamentalists.
   The second authorization which included similar language was
signed by Reagan on Aug. 11, 1985, two months after the highjacking
of TWA Flight 847 in which American Navy diver Robert Steedham was
killed. The intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of
the second finding, the Post said.

   Molly, the footloose and fancy-free
gorilla, made another exit from the Kansas City Zoo, but this time
it was authorized.
   Molly, who twice had escaped her confines here, was sent to the
Columbus Zoo, where zoo keepers hope she will find happiness in
Ohio with Bongo.
   Bongo, a 31-year-old gorilla, has been raising a son, Fossey,
since Fossey's mother died about a year ago.
   Molly, 12, is being loaned as part of a national breeding
program; the two zoos will share in any offspring. There are about
500 gorillas in captivity.
   In July, Molly propped a branch against the wall of her outside
exhibit and made a break. She was caught after wandering around the
camels and woolly monkeys. Last month, Molly's acrobatics landed
her atop the Ape House. She climbed down, and walked through the
front door.
   No one was hurt in either escape.
   On Tuesday, Molly spent her last day in Kansas City swinging on
her tire and hammock and posing for pictures.

<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco withdrew a
peace proposal to leftist guerrillas because of a wave of rebel
attacks, and the army has been ordered to attack the insurgents, a
cabinet minister said.
   ``It is incomprehensible that the answer by subversive groups to
a generous peace proposal would be so violent and criminal,'' the
minister of government, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, said in a broadcast
interview Tuesday.
   Trujillo is in charge of internal security in Colombia.
   Last month the president offered a cease-fire, negotiations,
pardons to guerrillas who surrendered and a chance for rebel
leaders to speak before congress.
   All six of Colombia's leftist guerrilla groups rejected the
plan, calling it an ultimatum for surrender.
   Gaviria was particularly critical of the country's largest
guerrilla group, the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, known by
its Spanish acronym as the FARC.
   Sunday and Monday FARC attacks killed 12 soldiers, six policemen
and three civilians, the Defense Ministry said Monday.
   ``The government authorizes full institutional support for the
armed forces to confront the guerrillas, because weakness or
complacency doesn't result in peace,'' Gaviria said in an interview
with the Bogota radio station Caracol.
   Minister of Justice Guillermo Plazas said the guerrillas' answer
to ``the olive branch offered by President Barco has been attacks
on the army, blowing up of pipelines and setting off bombs.''
   The FARC has used a cease-fire during the last four years ``to
cheat the government'' by building up its strength, Plazas said in
a broadcast interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.
   The FARC signed a truce with the government of President
Belisario Betancur four years ago. There has been sporadic fighting
between the FARC and government security forces during the truce.
   Another guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, has blown
up the country's main oil pipeline 85 times in the last two years.
   Last Saturday the guerrilla group blew up the pipeline, which
carries 225,000 barrels of oil a day from the Canon Limon field in
the northeast state of Arauca.
   Last Wednesday the National Liberation Army set off a bomb in
Bogota as the car of a Texaco executive was passing by.
   The executive, John Buttle, a Canadian, was not injured.
   And last July the National Liberation Army kidnapped the owner
of General Pipe Co., of Houston, Jake Gambini. There has been no
word on Gambini's fate.

<HEAD>Researchers Hope To Use AZT in Pregnant Women Infected With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pregnant women infected with the deadly AIDS
virus would be treated with the drug AZT in an attempt to protect
their unborn children if an experiment being planned by researchers
gets the go-ahead from review boards.
   ``The reason we think (prevention of infection of the fetus)
might be possible is that AZT prevents the replication of the
virus,'' said Dr. Daniel Hoth, director of the AIDS program at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
   ``It's theoretically possible that the AZT, if it reaches the
fetus, might prevent it from establishing an infection,'' he said,
referring to the drug formally known as azidothymidine.
   Hoth said in a telephone interview Tuesday night that the
studies are still at least several months away, as a formal
proposal has not yet been completed, and the proposal would have to
pass numerous hurdles in the form of review boards concerned with
the safety of such tests.
   Patricia Randall, the institute's spokeswoman, went even
further, saying the likelihood of an early start to such a study is
``still pretty tenuous.''
   ``There's a lot of steps between now and the beginning of a
study with pregnant women,'' she said.
   As of Sept. 26, AIDS had been diagnosed in 74,447 Americans, of
whom 1,185 were children under age 13, and 924 of those children
were infected at birth, according to the federal Center for Disease
Control. Of the 41,925 deaths among AIDS patients, 672 have been
children, the CDC reported.
   ``Most new infections of children with AIDS are related to an
infected mother,'' Hoth said.
   Among the still unanswered questions are exactly how the child
gets infected, he said.
   ``The virus might be transmitted in utero, that is, across the
placenta,'' Hoth said. ``The second possibility is it might be
transmitted at the time of childbirth through some blood-borne
transmission. The third possibility is that the child becomes
infected through close association with the mother after birth,
such as through breast-feeding, although that remains totally
speculative, totally unproven.''
   However, he said, ``It's the widespread opinion of most experts
in the field that one of the most important ways to stop the
infection in children is to prevent the infection by catching it as
early as possible. That leads you to the necessity of treating the
infected mother.''
   The proposal will call for studies on only a few dozen women who
would be in their third trimester of pregnancy to limit the
possibility of birth defects, he said.
   ``These are mothers that may be infected with the virus, but may
not have symptoms of AIDS,'' he said.
   Animal model studies using mice have shown that AZT _ the only
drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for AIDS patients
_ prevents the transmission of viral infection from an infected
mother to the offspring, he said, adding that he believed there
were no birth defects in those studies. However, he noted that
those tests did not involve the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, that causes AIDS, but a closely related retrovirus.
   The side-effects of AZT encountered by some people taking the
drug include a decrease in production of red or white blood cells,
and such problems are a major concern for the researchers, he said.
   ``That's the whole question here,'' Hoth said. ``Will it be
safe? What is the risk-benefit ratio? So we're proceeding
cautiously. There will be consultation with many experts. We have
obstetricians on our team, pediatricians. We'll be talking with
other experts, including ethicists, on this issue.''
   The institutional review boards that would have to approve the
studies once the protocol is completed ``are charged with the
protection of human subjects in clinical trials, so they must
review the protocol with an eye toward the risk-benefit for both
the mother and the child,'' Hoth said. ``Before we send it for
review, we want to have consensus among all of the experts.''
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus
most often is spread through close contact with blood, blood
products or semen from infected persons.
   No one is known to have recovered from AIDS, whose chief victims
have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users.

<HEAD>Broader Protection For Whistleblowers Okayed By House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has approved and sent to the Senate
a bill strengthening protection for whistelblowers who expose
federal waste and mismanagement.
   The measure was approved Tuesday on a 418-0 vote.
   Sponsors said the bill was needed because the Office of Special
Counsel, established to represent the interests of whistleblowers,
was not doing its job.
   The bill is designed to reverse decisions of courts and the
Merit Systems Protection Board _ a federal judicial agency _ that
made it difficult for whistleblowers to win their cases.
   The legislation would define clearly the Office of Special
Counsel's role as one of protecting whistleblowers. In some cases,
the counsel has proceeded against whistleblowers who came to the
office for help.
   The measure would make the Office of Special Counsel an
independent agency. It currently is part of the Merit Systems
Protection Board _ a quasi-judicial body that hears employees'
appeals.
   The bill also would:
   _Alter the burden of proof in reprisal cases against
whistleblowers. The employee would have to show only that the
agency's knowledge of the whistleblowing was a factor in his or her
punishment, rather than a ``significant'' or ``dominant'' factor as
required under current law.
   _Require an agency to demonstrate ``with clear and convincing
evidence'' that whistleblowing was not a material factor in the
personnel action. Currently the courts require a ``preponderance of
evidence,'' an easier standard for government agencies.
   _Expand the definition of prohibited personnel practices to
include reprisals against workers who cooperate with inspectors
general or the special counsel, those who testify in government
proceedings, and those who refuse to obey an order that violates
the law.
   _Allow individuals facing reprisals to appeal their cases
directly to the merit board.

   Singer-actress Cher's boyfriend will face a
misdemeanor charge of reckless driving rather than the felony
assault count he originally faced in a camera-smashing incident
with a photographer, publicists said.
   Rob Camilletti, 24, was arrested June 27 and booked for
investigation of felony assault with a deadly weapon after a
confrontation with Star tabloid photographer Peter Brandt outside
the Benedict Canyon home that Camilletti and Cher share. He was
released on $2,000 bail.
   Camilletti said he lost control of Cher's Ferrari and crashed
into Brandt's car while swerving into the home's driveway to avoid
photographers. He has admitted to smashing Brandt's camera.
   ``He tried to kill me. He tried to run me over at a high rate of
speed,'' Brandt said at the time.
   In a statement released Tuesday by publicists Lois Smith and
Lisa Kasteler, Camilletti said: ``I'm very pleased that the city
attorney understood that I never tried to hit the tabloid
photographer. It's true that I broke the guy's camera and telephone
after the accident, and I intend to reimburse him for that.''
   The release said the city attorney's office concluded that
Camilletti had not intended to run down the photographer.
   ``With this decision not to file any felony charges, I am now
hopeful that Cher and I can get back to some degree of normalcy
with our lives,'' he said.
   The city attorney could not immediately be reached for comment
by The Associated Press as there was no answer at the office
Tuesday evening. An attorney for Brandt also was out of the office.
   At the time, Cher and Camilletti, who is launching his own
acting career, said the crash was the result of weeks of
frustration with photographers they said were harassing them.
   Brandt filed a lawsuit against Cher and Camilletti, seeking
unspecified damages.

   Guerrillas battled government troops
at least seven times during recent days in new truce violations,
and 16 rebels were killed, the Defense Ministry reported.
   Meanwhile, military sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said two relatives of President Daniel Ortega were wounded when
rebels ambushed a civilian vehicle Tuesday in Chontales province.
Government officials did not confirm the report.
   The Defense Ministry statement released Tuesday night did not
say if there were any government casualties in the clashes.
   It said rebels attacked Monday in speedboats with 60-mm mortars
at a government border post 125 miles northwest of Managua. The
post at El Charro is on the Gulf of Fonseca, which is shared by
Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador on the Pacific coast.
   The Ministry said the other clashes occurred Saturday through
Monday in northern Jinotega and southeastern Zelaya Sur provinces.
   Defense Ministry sources said rebels wounded Ortega's relatives
when they ambushed a civilian vehicle Tuesday morning in central
Chontales province.
   They identified the two relatives as Irma Mongrio Rivas and
Alfonso Ortega. Mongrio Rivas suffered a bullet wound in a leg, the
sources said. The extent of Alfonso Ortega's injuries was not known.
   Their exact relationship to the president could not be
determined.
   The temporary truce between the leftist Sandinista government
and U.S.-supported rebels has been in effect on March 21. Each side
has accused the other of frequent violations, and negotiations
aimed at a permanent cease-fire to the 7-year-old civil war broke
down in June.
   The opposition newspaper La Prensa reported Tuesday that three
activists with the Confederation of Trade Union Unity were
assassinated Sunday by gunmen in military uniforms in Leon, 45
miles west of Managua.
   The pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario said three men,
including an army soldier, were arrested in connection with the
shootings.

<HEAD>Simple Bladder Cancer Test May Also Identify Other Cancers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simple urine test that detects bladder cancer
at a treatable stage may be used to help diagnose prostate and some
of the other cancers that afflict nearly a million Americans
annually, researchers say.
   The test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors,
said Dr. Raouf Guirguis of the National Cancer Institute. The
protein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer,
prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma.
   ``It seems to be in all the cancers we have screened,'' Guirguis
said.
   Existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer, involving removal of
tissue, pose risk, are often painful and sometimes do not detect
the cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured, the
cancer institute said.
   But Guirguis, Elliott Schiffman and colleagues, whose study is
published in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute, said
their test can identify bladder cancer at an early, treatable stage.
   They said they do not yet know whether the test will identify
cancers other than bladder cancer at an early enough stage for them
to be effectively treated.
   Cancer will strike 985,000 Americans this year, according to the
American Cancer Society. About 49 percent of cancer patients
survive five years after diagnosis.
   More than 49,000 Americans get bladder cancer each year and
about 10,000 die annually, the cancer institute said. The five-year
survival rate is 77 percent.
   The researchers are now using the test on volunteers from the
Navy, the Army and in Egypt, where bladder cancer is a more serious
problem, Guirguis said.
   If these expanded trials show that the test is accurate, it can
be used as a screening test _ to diagnose cancer _ and as a
follow-up to determine whether treatment has eradicated cancer.
   ``The follow-up of these patients is extremely important,''
Guirguis said.
   Widespread use of the test awaits completion of the large-scale
trials in progress, Guirguis said.
   The test is based on the detection of the protein autocrine
motility factor.
   ``The protein is produced in the transformed or malignant
cells,'' Guirguis said. ``We think it's stimulating the movement of
the cancer cells and aiding their invasion _ metastasis.''
   The researchers used a very sensitive test that allows detection
of minute amounts of a chemical.
   Researchers hope to develop an even simpler version of the test
that would consist of a paper strip that would turn color if the
protein were present, Guirguis said. Such a test could be
manufactured for only a few cents per test, and could thus be used
widely to screen people for cancer.
   For some cancers the test might be used with urine, and for
other cancers it might be used to look for the protein in blood.
   Guirguis and his colleagues said in their report that in
patients with spreading bladder cancer the protein occurs at higher
levels than in patients with localized bladder cancer. And it is
absent in patients without cancer.
   The researchers are trying to make sure the protein is not
secreted in the absence of cancer. They have determined that it is
not present during pregnancy or in inflammatory conditions,
Guirguis said.
   ``That's different from other tests that people have used,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Brazil To Enact New Constitution, Consolidate Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil today is to enact a new
constitution consolidating the country's return to democratic
government after 21 years of right-wing military rule.
   ``This is a historic date for our country,'' President Jose
Sarney told Brazilians Tuesday night in a nationwide TV broadcast.
``We have reached the end of a long path ... My mission of helping
the country through its transition to democracy is fulfilled.''
   The 559 legislators doubling as a constituent assembly worked
for 19 months on the 245-article document that governs everything
from interest rates to mining rights and land reform. The charter
is Brazil's eighth since independence from Portugal in 1822 and
replaces the authoritarian document handed down by military
generals in 1969.
   ``The new constitution will consolidate a representative and
participatory democracy,'' the president of the constituent
assembly, Rep. Ulysses Guimaraes said in a press conference. ``For
the first time the individual will have precedence over the state.''
   Sarney, who at times fought bitterly against left-leaning
measures in the new document, said in his broadcast he would be the
constitution's ``greatest servant.''
   In earlier broadcasts, Sarney made veiled threats that if
certain articles were passed, the military might refuse to respect
the new constitution.
   The constitution removes many of the arbitrary powers used by
the military government during its harsh rule. The document
abolishes the president's power to simply decree laws, ends
censorship, prohibits torture, guarantees political rights and
broadens workers' right to strike and to unionize.
   Nationalistic legislators also managed to limit mineral mining
to national companies and prohibit further oil drilling risk
contracts between the state-run Petrobras, which has a monopoly on
oil exploration and drilling in Brazil, and international companies.
   At the same time, the right-wing scored a victory, managing to
water-down a land reform law that protects ``productive land'' from
expropriation. The law further stalls Sarney's program to
distribute land to 1.4 million peasant families, in a country where
2 percent of landowners hold 60 pecent of arable land.
   Judiciary analysts have said, however, there are many articles
in the hefty document that will be difficult to define or to
enforce in complimentary legislation.
   Guimaraes, 72, said the charter would be respected by all _
including the Armed Forces.
   ``The military period left deep marks. There is an awareness
that the regime is good and from the Armed Forces we have heard
only words of support and confidence in the stability of
democracy,'' Guimaraes said.
   The enactment of the new constituion will be marked by day-long
celebrations starting early today with an open-air mass before the
twin-domed Congress and a reception for delegates from more than 30
Latin American and Portuguese-speaking nations.
   Sarney 58, became president in 1985 after President-elect
Tancredo Neves died before taking office.

   Vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen is
sounding confident about his showdown tonight with Republican Dan
Quayle although the Democrat's staff is downplaying expectations by
expressing concern.
   ``Are you going to be standing behind me as we open the Quayle
season early tomorrow night?'' Bentsen asked a flag-waving crowd of
more than 500 who greeted him at the Omaha airport Tuesday night.
   The Texas senator hammered the Republicans on issues he's bound
to raise, given the chance, in the first nationally broadcast
debate between the two candidates.
   ``Tomorrow night we're going to have 90 minutes to present Mike
Dukakis' vision of America _ an America on the move, an America
that believes in excellence in education for all of our children,''
Bentsen said.
   It would be, he said, ``a Democratic administration that's
committed to protecting Social Security against the Republican
raids that have come year after year with Dan Quayle voting eight
times to cut Social Security.''
   He said the Democrats would pursue health insurance for the
uninsured while ``the opposition has done nothing.''
   ``Mike Dukakis is committed to an America that is number one in
the economy of the world and ... number one in national defense,''
he said, later citing the huge budget deficits of the Reagan years.
   One of Bentsen's goals will be to counter what he contends are
distortions of Dukakis' positions on defense and crime-fighting _
important issues in Texas and other Southern states where Bentsen
is working hardest for the ticket.
   Bentsen has led a nearly cloistered existence for four days,
taking part in issues briefings and conducting mock debates in
Washington, D.C., and later in Austin, Texas. But he set off for
Omaha with a flurry, speaking at a campaign rally at the Texas
state capitol and later at the Omaha airport.
   Campaign staff said Bentsen again would slip behind closed doors
today, except for a quick midday trip to examine the setup in the
auditorium and later the debate itself.
   Bentsen talked casually with reporters on his campaign plane en
route to Omaha, appearing relaxed and upbeat. But his staff
continued to try to blunt public expectations that the powerful
Bentsen would thrash the less experienced Quayle.
   Despite days of practice, aides said the 67-year-old Texas
senator was not adept at the media-age need to boil down his
statements into one- and two-minute sound bites.
   Press secretary Mike McCurry, who was Quayle's stand-in for
Bentsen in mock debates in Austin on Tuesday, said the Democratic
candidate was looking for ``the best way of making a point
memorable or punchy,'' and he was still having trouble with the
time limits.
   ``The red light goes off frequently,'' he said.
   ``It's all a matter of getting ready to present it (his
positions) in two-minute answers and one-minute rebuttals,'' said
Susan Estrich, Michael Dukakis' campaign manager who was helping
brief Bentsen. ``Our counsel to him has been to be himself.''
   Bentsen displayed no sign of being unsure of himself.
   ``Tomorrow is a big day for us, and a big day for this
campaign,'' Bentsen told the crowd of about 1,500 people at the
Austin rally. ``And I can't think of a greater way to start it than
surrounded by friends here on the capitol steps of Texas.''
   Bentsen said the Democrats offered ``proven and tested
leadership.''
   ``George Bush and Dan Quayle hear no questions and offer no
answers. They tell us to lower our sights, to live on our past,
rest on our laurels,'' while the Democrats would offer new
leadership, he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC plans to do some research to find out why
its coverage of the Summer Olympics fell more than 3 rating points
short of the guarantee to advertisers _ a discrepancy that could
cost the network millions.
   Gerald Jaffe, NBC vice president for research projects, said the
network probably wouldn't make the results of the study public,
since it could bear on competition with the 1992 games.
   But among the likeliest contributors: the 14-hour time
difference between Seoul and New York that put live coverage of
such popular events as gymnastics in the morning, and the late
September-early-October timing.
   The games ended Sunday, and NBC's coverage had an average A.C.
Nielsen Co. rating of 17.9 _ not counting opening and closing
ceremonies _ considerably lower than the 21.2 rating NBC had
promised advertisers. The 1984 summer games from Los Angeles had
averaged a 23.2 for ABC.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with television.
   NBC will have to give advertisers as much as $70 million in
commercial time, to make up for what had been promised, according
to the Wall Street Journal.
   CBS has been awarded the TV contract for the next Winter
Olympics, which will be held in 1992, and expects to make a bid for
that year's summer games. The network also is studying NBC's
results.
   But CBS' vice President for marketing, David Poltrack, thinks
the 1988 Olympics suffered mainly from competition with other
sports and from time pressures on viewers, especially students back
in school.
   ``I attribute a lot of the under-delivery of ratings to the fall
scheduling. It's not necessarily typical of what we can expect in
future Olympics,'' said Poltrack. The 1992 games, in Barcelona,
Spain, will be earlier in the summer.
   Nonetheless, NBC's six nights of Olympics coverage last week
took six of the the top 10 spots in the Nielsen ratings and gave
NBC a decisive victory over ABC and CBS. NBC had an average 17.5
rating to ABC's 12.3 and CBS' 11.2. It also provided an important
promotional base for NBC's new fall shows.
   ``The actual performance by the Olympics in key groups (of
viewers) was a really dominant performance. Whether it was as
dominant as anticipated, that's something else,'' said Jaffe.
   The closing ceremonies Sunday fell to a 12.3 rating. NBC had
expected closer to 20.0. CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote''
and the movie ``Cocoon'' out-rated the Sunday coverage, as did
``Liberace'' on ABC. Those four shows made up the rest of the top
10. The closing ceremonies ranked 22 out of 55 shows.
   During the games' first week, ratings tended to climb as the
week wore on. The second week, they tended to decline. Monday's
coverage was the highest-rated show of the week, with a 19.3 rating.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won in the news Nielsens with a
10.0 rating. The ``CBS Evening News'' was second with a 9.8. ``NBC
Nightly News,'' pre-empted on the West Coast by Olympics coverage,
had a 9.6.
   The week's lowest-rated prime-time shows were: ``Live! Dick
Clark Presents,'' ``Wiseguy,'' ``Mutts,'' ``Beauty & the Beast,''
``Equalizer,'' ``Mr. Belvedere _ Sunday,'' ``Deal of the Century,''
``Frank's Place,'' ``First Impressions'' and a paid political
program by Lyndon LaRouche.
   CBS announced Tuesday that due to low ratings it had canceled
``Frank's Place,'' the critically acclaimed comedy starring Tim
Reid as the owner of a Creole restaurant in New Orleans.
   Also Tuesday, the union that represents NBC's technical workers
said the network has offered to buy out the jobs of 140 New
York-based engineers and technicians.
   ``If all 140 people accept, they will pay it, although they are
aiming to cut only 40 positions,'' said Paul McElroy, a spokesman
for Local 11 of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians.
   NBC, like ABC and CBS, has dramatically reduced its payroll
since it was taken over, in its case by the General Electric Co.,
two years ago. About 400 people in the news division lost their
jobs and 110 others are scheduled to go before the end of the year.

   A 28-year-old man who hijacked a
Brazilian jetliner with more than 100 people aboard has died
following a five-hour police interrogation, hospital officials said.
   Raimundo Conceicao, described by authorities as a
``psychopath,'' died Tuesday of kidney failure after five days of
steady progress, according to a medical report released by the
Santa Genoveva hospital in Goiania, 850 miles northwest of Rio.
   On Sep. 29, Conceicao underwent surgery to stop internal
bleeding caused by police bullet wounds suffered as the hijacking
drew to a close.
   On Sunday, Conceicao underwent five hours of intense questioning
by police on the hijacking. Late Monday afternoon, Conceicao was
rushed to the hospital's intensive care unit with soaring blood
pressure.
   The causes of Conceicao's sudden change in condition were
unknown, according to the medical report, but a doctor who asked
not to be identified said Conceicao's soaring blood pressure could
have been prompted by a build-up of intestinal gases during the
interrogation.
   Doctors on Monday refused to let police talk to Conceicao,
saying his health had deteriorated. The contents of Conceicao's
police deposition were not made public.
   On Sep. 29, Conceicao burst into the cockpit of a Brazilian
jetliner on a routine flight from western Brazil to Rio and
demanded the plane be flown to the federal capital of Brasilia.
   He reportedly told negotiators he wanted to crash the plane into
a government building to ``settle accounts'' with the government
over its economic policies.
   The plane was forced to land 125 miles southwest of the capital,
in Goiania, where Conceicao shot and killed the co-pilot and
wounded two others before being wounded by police as he prepared to
change planes.
   On Monday, government officials announced passengers at major
Brazilian airports will now have their baggage checked before
boarding domestic flights. Previously, only passengers boarding
international flights were subject to police checks.

   Vice presidential candidates Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen
applied the final touches to their strategy for tonight's
nationally broadcast debate as the two presidential contenders
vowed to help America's forgotten class.
   Republican Quayle promised to focus his attack on Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, not his debate opponent
Bentsen, when the two running mates clash at the Civic Auditorium
in Omaha, Neb.
   ``Dukakis is running for president, and he's the one I'm very
concerned about becoming president. It would be a very troubling
notion for many Americans,'' Quayle told reporters Tuesday on his
campaign plane from Washington, D.C.
   Bentsen is hoping to counter what he believes are distortions of
Dukakis' record, especially the Democratic presidential nominee's
stand on defense and crime.
   ``Tomorrow night we're going to have 90 minutes to present Mike
Dukakis' vision of America _ an America on the move, an America
that believes in excellence in education for all of our children,''
the Texas senator told a flag-waving crowd of more than 500 people
at the Omaha airport.
   Bentsen's running mate _ the Massachusetts governor _ was
limiting his campaign appearances today, tending to gubernatorial
duties in Boston and later attending a debate-watching party.
   George Bush was speaking to high school students in Littleton,
Colo., before addressing rallies in Denver and Oklahoma City.
   The vice presidential candidates were planning walk-throughs at
the refurbished Civic Auditorium around midday before their own
last minute preparations for the debate.
   Organizers said Tuesday that the 10,000-seat hall was ready for
the debate after workers put the finishing touches on network
anchor booths, patriotic bunting and even a red-carpeted ``spin
valley'' where Democrats and Republicans will expound on their
views of the debate for any reporter who wants to listen.
   ``We think we've got this hall turned into what we want, and
that is a debate hall,'' said Ed Fouhy, producer of the event.
   A national poll released Tuesday found Quayle's presence on the
Republican ticket doing some damage to the GOP cause, and put the
race for the White House at essentially a dead heat.
   In the CBS News-New York Times poll, the Bush-Quayle ticket drew
the support of 48 percent of the 1,034 probable voters surveyed
while Dukakis-Bentsen got 46 percent.
   When the respondents were asked about the presidential nominees,
without their running mates, the support for Dukakis declined to 43
percent while Bush remained at 48 percent. The poll, conducted
Saturday through Monday, had a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points.
   On Tuesday, the Bentsen campaign was setting low expectations
for its vice presidential candidate in the debate, with aides to
the candidate suggesting that he was not adept at boiling down his
positions to one-minute sound bites. The campaign is trying to
dispel the belief that the more experienced Bentsen would manhandle
the junior senator from Indiana.
   Bentsen, however, was buoyed by his chances.
   ``Are you going to be standing behind me as we open the Quayle
season early tomorrow night?'' he asked the airport crowd.
   Quayle was providing few details on his debate strategy, but
promised to ``just be myself'' as he ``communicates with the
American public in an unedited version.''
   ``They'll be able to see Dan Quayle as I really am,'' he said.
``The American people don't know me. They have a lot of questions
... They don't have any details of who Dan Quayle is.''
   Quayle's running mate Bush used a speech in Sacramento, Calif.,
to propose a $100 million program to encourage community volunteer
service by young people.
   ``I want our affluent to help our poor,'' the vice president
said of his Youth Engaged in Service to America plan. ``I want the
young men and women of our tree-lined suburbs to get on a bus, or
the subway, or the metro, and go into the cities where the want
is.''
   Dukakis, meanwhile, told a rally in Toledo, Ohio, that his White
House would care about the plight of struggling families.
   ``I care about working people and working families and that's
the difference between Mike Dukakis and George Bush, and Democrats
and Republicans,'' he said. ``We care.''
   The Democratic nominee also compared Bush's attempts to portray
the Democrats as a party only interested in the nation's negatives
as the same tactic used by Richard M. Nixon 28 years ago.
   ``They said the same thing about Jack Kennedy in 1960 _ all that
gloom and doom,'' Dukakis said. ``And what was he saying? `We can
do better.'''
   In his campaign stops in the Midwest, Dukakis underscored the
theme of his latest ads, titled ``The Packaging of George Bush,''
which depict the GOP nominee as a product of media experts and a
candidate with no solution to the nation's problems.
   ``He offers slogans and symbols; we offer solutions,'' Dukakis
said.
   Aides say the ad series is expected to cost the campaign more
than $1 million.
   The Bush campaign, meanwhile, released an attack ad aimed at
Dukakis' handling of the Massachusetts prison furlough system, said
Bush spokeswoman Sheila Tate.
   The ad shows inmates walking through a revolving door while an
announcer says the state's system gave weekend passes to
first-degree murderers and crime statistics appear on the screen.
   The Bush campaign has repeatedly criticized Dukakis in the case
of Willie Horton, who raped a Maryland woman and stabbed her fiance
while on a weekend furlough.

   Children with AIDS improve dramatically when given
the drug AZT, regaining lost intelligence, speech and the ability
to walk, according to a study.
   However, the drug does not cure the disease, and children
continue to die despite the treatment, researchers said.
   The results of the research were widely publicized when
presented at an international AIDS meeting in Stockholm in June. A
detailed report on the treatment was published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.
   HIV, the AIDS virus, destroys the body's immune system and
damages the brain. In children, these neurological problems are
particularly severe. Youngsters' intelligence falls, and they often
lose their ability to walk and talk.
   The drug AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is already
the mainstay of treatment for adults with AIDS. In the latest
study, doctors gave the medicine to 21 AIDS victims who ranged from
age 1 to 12.
   Of these, 62 percent had clear evidence of brain damage caused
by HIV, and every one improved. Overall, IQ scores rose 15 points,
and in some cases the youngsters' intelligence returned to the
level before they got sick.
   The study by Dr. Philip A. Pizzo and colleagues from the
National Cancer Institute concluded that AZT produced ``consistent
and dramatic improvement in symptoms.''
   The IQ of an 11-year-old boy had fallen from 99 to 71 after the
start of AIDS symptoms. Within nine months of getting AZT, his IQ
was back to 99.
   Even those with no obvious brain damage showed increases in IQ.
The doctors said this may be particularly important, because it
suggests that the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome may have subtle effects on youngsters' mental functions.
   Brain scans also showed that shrunken tissue in the youngsters'
heads had returned substantially after treatment.
   Despite the improvements, however, five of the youngsters died
during the year-long study.

   A high-ranking official of the ruling
party has threatened to strip an outspoken Anglican bishop of his
freedom to worship, but other clergmen have vowed to defy any
infringement on their religious rights.
   Moses Mudavadi, secretary-general of the Kenya African National
Union, threatened to strip Biship David Gitari of his freedom to
worship after the bishop criticized the way the ruling party
adopted resolutions.
   ``You should not be surprised if we, as a KANU government,
removed that freedom from you through Parliament,'' Mudavadi said
to Gitari in comments reported Saturday by Kenya's three
English-language newspapers.
   Anglican Archbishop Manasses Kuria, in a Sunday sermon to a
Nairobi parish, said the Church of the Province of Kenya would not
allow anyone to deny Christians the right to worship.
   ``The freedom of worship is God-given and cannot be taken away
at will by any individual,'' Kuria said.
   Anglican Bishop Alexander Muge, of the Rift Valley Eldoret
province, said Mudavadi's comments marked a ``sad moment for our
independent Kenya.
   ``Prison cells and enough graveyards must be prepared before the
decree is effected because many will continue to worship whether
Mr. Mudavadi likes it or not,'' Muge said.
   Muge and Kuria were quoted by the English-language Daily Nation
and The Standard. The Kenya Times, which is owned by the ruling
party, also reported Kuria's remarks.
   Gitari, bishop of Mount Kenya East diocese, angered politicians
by saying delegates to the party's conference rubber-stamped the
party's resolutions.
   The Kenya African National Union is Kenya's sole legal political
party.
   On Thursday, legislators lambasted Gitari, accusing him and
three other outspoken clergymen of trying to destabilize the
government.
   It was the second time in three months parliamentarians have
suspended legislative business to criticize clergy members, a sign
of increasing friction between the government of President Daniel
arap Moi and Anglican clergy, who have spoken out against alleged
government corruption and human rights abuses.
   Muge said he was briefly detained on July 17 and police kept
parishioners from entering his church after one run-in with the
government.

<TEXT>
   In two days of picketing, the Hollywood
Teamsters' strike has accomplished what scriptwriters failed to
achieve over five months in their walkout: the shutdown of a studio.
   Citing death threats, bomb scares and sabotaged equipment,
Cannell Studios said Tuesday it has halted production on its
television shows ``Hunter'' and ``Sonny Spoon.''
   It said the incidents were related to the strike by 3,200
drivers, laborers and electricians and that production would resume
work only when it is safe.
   In a separate incident, one picket was arrested for battery
Tuesday morning at Universal Studios, said police Lt. Ron Young.
The picket was released on $250 bail.
   A Cannell spokeswoman said production of the NBC-TV programs was
suspended because tires were slashed or deflated on nine vehicles,
a brake line was severed on a semi-trailer, holding tanks were
punctured on a mobile dressing room, a trailer hitch was sabotaged
and at least three employees were physically assaulted.
   Employees also received death threats and the company's Los
Angeles office received a bomb scare, said the spokeswoman, Lisa
Lewinson. The office building, containing several hundred
employees, was evacuated for more than two hours Monday, the first
day of the strike.
   Lewinson said the company was ``outraged by the acts of
violence, vandalism and threats to our employees and property.''
The studio planned to resume production ``as soon as possible with
or without an end to the strike.''
   A Teamster official denied that the union members had done
anything illegal.
   ``All of the members were advised that they were to conduct
themselves in a lawful manner,'' said Ed Prelock, director of legal
and contract affairs.
   ``We're going to do everything that's lawfully permissible and
nothing more,'' he said. ``Sure, there's liable to be emotions.
Hopefully, the reactions are simply that and nothing more. We are
not personally aware of any physical violence.''
   Teamsters pickets were stationed Tuesday at nearly every
Hollywood studio.
   The Teamsters drivers, who transport actors, equipment and props
for television and movie producers, picketed Monday at the Cannell
offices and the outdoor productions of ``Sonny Spoon'' at an
undisclosed location and of ``Hunter'' at the Santa Monica pier.
   At the ``Hunter'' filming, some pickets blew air horns and
banged on a trash container during scenes. Filming was delayed by
more than an hour and the production closed earlier than scheduled
Monday evening, Lewinson said.
   ``Hunter'' stars former pro football player Fred Dryer as a
quick-witted detective; ``Sonny Spoon,'' an NBC adventure program,
features Mario Van Peebles. The Cannell Studios are named after
producer-scriptwriter Stephen J. Cannell, who also created ``The
Rockford Files'' and ``The A-Team.''
   There have been other reported bomb threats related to the
strike, said police Sgt. Roger Jackson. At least one other studio
complained that some replacement drivers had been harassed by
pickets.
   ``These actions will not be tolerated,'' the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers said in a statement. The incidents
``are not only inappropriate, but perhaps illegal. ... We expect
and demand that no further incidents take place. And we call on the
Teamsters to take appropriate action to ensure that their strike be
conducted in a legal and nonviolent atmosphere.''
   The strike against the 217-member alliance began early Monday
after weekend negotiations collapsed. On Thursday, the Teamsters
voted 1,441-196 to reject the contract proposal submitted by the
alliance.
   Unresolved issues include overtime rules for weekend work,
salary rates, wages for out-of-town film and television production
and guidelines for the making of nonunion films. Some drivers are
being asked to take a pay cut from $16.61 to $14 per hour.
   Although the five-month strike by the 9,000-member Writers Guild
of America halted much of the industry's production, it never
caused any the alliance members to close their doors and halt
production.

<HEAD>Antibiotic Appears To Help Some Women With Premenstrual Syndrome</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women suffering from premenstrual syndrome
should react cautiously to a new report suggesting that a common
antibiotic may help ease symptoms in some, says a National
Institute of Mental Health researcher.
   Dr. David Rubinow, a psychiatrist and clinical director at the
institute, said many treatments have been proposed for premenstrual
syndrome but none have been proven to work.
   ``I think the whole area of premenstrual syndrome has been
characterized by a new story and a new treatment every year for the
last 50 years,'' he said.
   He made the comment following an announcement Tuesday that the
antibiotic doxycycline could ease symptoms in women who had an
unrecognized underlying infection. The report by Dr. Atilla Toth, a
gynecologist at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New
York, was published in The Journal of International Medical
Research.
   Rubinow said he was not familiar with Toth's study, but he had
some general comments about premenstrual syndrome, which is one of
his research interests.
   ``While I can't reject the results of this study out of hand
without having an opportunity to review the work, I would simply
urge considerable caution in the interpretation of this data, lest
people run out and demand the latest of a long series of treatments
that may not be effective, at best, and may be associated with
complications, at worst.''
   At a press conference, Toth said that 15 women who were given
the antibiotic and asked to rate their symptoms showed a ``highly
significant improvement in the symptom score at the end of the
month.'' Fifteen others given a placebo showed little change in
symptoms.
   Toth said an estimated 90 percent of women suffer from
premenstrual syndrome during their reproductive years, and about
one-fourth of those have symptoms severe enough to disrupt their
professional or personal lives. The symptoms can include weight
gain, breast tenderness, extreme irritability, fatigue and
sometimes suicidal tendencies, he said.
   He said he does not know how many of the women may have
infections and could therefore be helped by the antibiotic. ``I
don't think there's going to be one approach that's going to answer
the universe of patients that have this difficulty,'' he said.
   Doxycycline is a commonly used drug without severe side effects,
Rubinow said. The danger is that doctors who do not do a careful
evaluation of a patient may prescribe it and miss another
underlying psychiatric or medical condition that could be treated,
he said.
   Toth said seven of the women studied remained free of symptoms
as long as three years after taking doxycycline.
   His explanation is that low-grade infections in these women are
disrupting the lining of the uterus or the function of the ovaries,
producing hormonal irregularities that result in the symptoms of
premenstrual syndrome.

<HEAD>Amnesty Cites Human Rights Abuses In Record 135 Countries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today accused a record 135
nations of abusing human rights in its annual report, but it hailed
the creation of more than 1,000 human rights groups as well as new
laws to protect prisoners.
   The violations charged by the human rights group in its report
include execution of a mentally retarded man in the United States
and killing of unarmed Afghan civilians by Soviet and government
troops.
   Amnesty said the list of offenders for 1987 was the longest it
has published since the organization was founded in 1961.Amnesty,
which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1977, recorded abuses last year
in more than 80 percent of the 159 U.N. member states.
   But it said it was encouraged by the emergence of more than
1,000 human rights groups in recent years and the proliferation of
laws to protect prisoners' rights.
   It added: ``More than ever before in world history, governments
are exposed to the glare of international publicity _ the greatest
weapon we have.''
   It said at least 760 political prisoners were executed in 39
countries in 1987 but estimated the number probably was much higher
because of secret executions. It also reported that governments
used a variety of methods to deflect criticism, including death
squads in Latin America.
   The 278-page report said: ``In at least half the countries of
the world, people are locked away for speaking their minds, often
after trials that are no more than a sham. In at least a third of
the world's nations, men, women and even children are tortured. In
scores of countries, governments pursue their goals by kidnapping
and murdering their own citizens.''
   The report cited the United States, where 25 prisoners were put
to death last year, for executing John Brogdon, a man diagnosed as
mentally retarded. He was executed July 30, 1987, in the Louisiana
electric chair for raping, torturing, and murdering an 11-year-old
girl.
   The group also said ``substanstial doubts'' clouded the
conviction of Edward Earl Johnson, who was executed in
Mississippi's gas chamber on May 20, 1987, for murdering a marshall
in a small town.
   Amnesty opposes the death penalty.
   The report said the Soviet Union released 259 people, most of
them prisoners of conscience. But it added that nearly 200 were
pardoned under secret decrees that falsely implied they were
criminals and ``hid the fact that they had been unjustly imprisoned
in the first place.''
   Authorities held 300 other Soviet prisoners of conscience in
prisons, in exile or in psychiatric hospitals, it said.
   Soviet and Afghan troops, often in reprisal attacks against
anti-communist rebels, killed dozens of unarmed civilians in
Afghanistan, the report said.
   In China, more than 200 convicted criminals were put to death
for offenses ranging from murder and rape to drug smuggling, theft
and ``showing pornographic movies.'' But that figure represents
only a fraction of the total number of death sentences and
executions, the report said.
   Turkey, Czechoslovakia and East Germany closed channels of
information to hide violations, it said, and China, Haiti, Syria
and South Africa clamped down on the reporting of abuses by denying
prisoners access to lawyers or families.
   It said the death from torture of a South Korea student, Park
Chong-chol, in January 1987 sparked widespread protests that
resulted in the prosecutions of eight police officers and the
resignation of government ministers.
   ``Today, even one death can set off waves of anger and protest
worldwide ... It doesn't always happen but it can,'' Amnesty said.
   Among other abuses were the reported massacre by Sudanese forces
of hundreds of unarmed Dinka tribespeople, the summary execution by
Iraq of hundreds of unarmed Kurds, the disappearance of hundreds of
Peruvian farmers seized by government forces, and court-ordered
executions South Africa and Iran.
   The report cited politically motivated killings by
pro-government assassins in Brazil, El Salvador and the
Philippines, as well as arbitrary arrests, torture and killings in
Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Uganda.
   In Western Europe, Spain was cited for torturing Basque
separatist prisoners; Britain for failing to publish a police
inquiry into the killings of six unarmed Irish Republican Army
guerrillas in 1982; and France, Italy, Austria, Greece, Malta,
Norway and Switzerland for jailing draft objectors.
   In Israel, the report said, a court permitted the secret service
to use ``a moderate measure of physical pressure'' in interrogating
suspects.
   Iran executed at least 158 people, although the true number was
probably higher, it said.

   A Michelangelo drawing of the suicide of
Cleopatra, discovered last August, will go on display for the first
time Sunday at the National Gallery of Art.
   The drawing had not been noticed before because it was on the
reverse side of a better known work that had been pasted onto a
backing. It was revealed when conservators removed the better-known
drawing, which also depicts the ancient Egyptian ruler, because it
was not being preserved properly on the backing.
   The well-known drawing on the front illustrates the traditional
story of her suicide, in which she had an asp brought to her in a
basket of figs and put it on her arm. It shows the snake biting her
breast. Cleopatra's hair is carefully dressed and her expression is
calm and melancholy.
   The newly-found drawing, much less finished, shows her hair in
disorder, her eyes staring out at the viewer and her mouth open as
if in a scream. It will be at the gallery's West Building until
Dec. 11.

<HEAD>House Kills Bill to Review Detention of Cubans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has killed a move to set ways for
reviewing the continued detention of Cubans who entered the United
States during the 1980 Mariel boatlift.
   Under legislation defeated Tuesday by a 271-144 vote, Mariel
aliens denied parole would have been given the right to a hearing
before an administrative law judge.
   The hearing would have been required within 90 days after the
end of a Justice Department review, or within 90 days of the
alien's detention by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The legislation provided that to continue detention, the
department would have to prove that the detainee would pose a
threat to the community or would violate reasonable conditions of
release.
   More than 125,000 Cubans came to the United States between April
and October 1980, when Cuba opened its port of Mariel for citizens
wishing to leave. The group included many people with criminal
records and mental illness.

   The Interior Department says its agents
destroyed 51 percent more marijuana plants this summer than they
did in all of last year.
   A department announcement Tuesday said law enforcement officers
were not sure whether the increase ``meant that drug activity
actually is increasing on federal lands or whether it merely
reflects the department's intensified enforcement efforts.''
   The department is in charge of the national parks, battlefields,
monuments, seashores and recreation areas; Indian reservations;
wildlife refuges and other public land, mostly in the West.
   Interior agencies seized and destroyed 166,000 marijuana plants
from mid-June to mid-September this year compared with 110,000
plants in all of last year, the department said.

<HEAD>Reagan Sgns Legislation To Assist Indigent AIDS Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has signed emergency
legislation that extends by six months a federal program providing
costly medicine for indigent victims of AIDS.
   The White House said Tuesday the president had approved the bill
which authorizes spending $15 million to continue supplies of the
drug AZT to such victims through next March 31. The program would
have expired at midnight last Friday, but the House passed the
Senate bill and sent it to the White House.
   The legislation avoids an interruption in the federal program
providing AZT to victims who cannot afford the treatment, which can
cost more than $600 a month. AZT is the only drug approved by the
Food and Drug Administration for use in combating AIDS.

<HEAD>Conrail Barred From Seeking Reimbursements From Amtrak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that Conrail cannot
seek reimbursement from Amtrak for damage claims arising from the
deaths of 16 people last year when a Conrail engine was hit by an
Amtrak passenger train.
   U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch ruled that an indemnification
agreement between Amtrak and Conrail cannot be enforced because of
evidence that gross and willful negligence by the Conrail crew
caused the Jan. 4, 1987 accident.
   The collision occurred north of Baltimore after the Conrail
engineer and brakeman ignored a series of railroad signals before
the freight engine entered the path of an oncoming high-speed
Amtrak passenger train.
   If upheld, the ruling signed late Monday means that Conrail
would be solely responsible for defending more than 60 wrongful
death and personal injury suits that seek millions of dollars in
damages.

<HEAD>Union Leader Slams Labor's Swing To Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Britain's transit
workers union warns that the Labor Party, by moving to the center
to broaden its appeal, could jeopardize its standing with its
strongest supporters.
   ``They want our money and our strength, but they fear our
power,'' Ron Todd, head of the 1.25 million-member Transport and
General Workers' Union, said Tuesday night during a meeting at the
party's annual conference.
   ``There is a real division in the party which needs to be
bridged as a matter of urgency,'' he said.
   Todd's broadside marked the first serious public clash at the
weeklong conference, which party leader Neil Kinnock regards as a
key step toward the adoption of a wholesale review of Labor
policies.
   Todd controls one-fifth of the voting strength of the
policy-making conference through a system under which the bosses of
the Trades Union Congress, the national labor federation, wield
huge blocks of votes allocated according to membership.
   The arrangement dates back to the turn of the century when the
unions founded the party.
   In the 1920s, Labor overtook the centrist Liberals to become,
along with the currently governing Conservatives, one of Britain's
two major parties.
   The first post-World War II Labor government founded the welfare
state and set up the free National Health Service.
   Earlier in the conference, which ends Friday, Todd and other top
union chiefs used their block votes to ensure Kinnock a huge
victory in a leadership challenge by the leader of Labor's left,
Tony Benn.
   The union leaders also endorsed broadly the first phase of a
two-stage policy review which acknowledges a permanent role for
capitalism and drops previous commitments to wholesale
renationalization of state-owned industries sold by Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The unions are themselves divided between moderates and leftists
such as Todd.
   But their near-unanimous stance in Blackpool reflected a tacit
acceptance of Kinnock's argument that the party must modify its
image as the only hope of regaining power after three election
defeats by Mrs. Thatcher.
   Polls show that the clout of the unions, which fund the party
and provided more than $3.3 million for the general election
campaign in 1987, is itself a vote loser for Labor.
   Kinnock's aides said privately they were annoyed by Todd's
outburst soon after the leadership election ballot and the vote on
the policy review.
   The speech partly overshadowed Kinnock's keynote address Tuesday
in which he said Labor must adopt new economic policies. He
rejected charges that he was selling out Socialism.
   ``There is no concession to Thatcherism as great as letting it
win again,'' said Kinnock.
   Todd also is opposed to dropping Labor's electorally unpopular
commitment to scrap Britain's nuclear weapons unilaterally.
   The second- and third-biggest unions, engineers and municipal
workers, are led by moderates who now suggest a reduction in union
voting power in favor of legislators and local party branches at
Labor conferences.

<HEAD>Police Raid Alleged Honasan Hideout, Aquino Admits Failures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today arrested an alleged aide
of former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, and a senior
officer claimed investigators were closing in on the renegade
leader of last year's bloody coup attempt.
   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy military commander of Manila, told
reporters former Master Sgt. Godofredo Gamboa was arrested early
today during a raid on his home in suburban Caloocan City.
   Meanwhile, President Corazon Aquino acknowledged that her
government had failed to resolve many of the country's problems and
restore social justice as promised after the Marcos administration
collapsed.
   Oxales said the raiders also seized a .45 caliber pistol and
assorted ammunition. Gamboa, a former counterintelligence agent,
denied he was involved in any attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   But Oxales claimed Gamboa, who faces illegal weapons charges,
was a ``close contact man'' of Honasan, renegade leader of the Aug.
28, 1987, coup attempt.
   At least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in
the failed coup.
   ``We are closely following the leads we are receiving, and we
are closing in on `Gringo,''' Oxales said. ``To get Honasan, we are
getting those people who are close to him.''
   On Monday, police arrested three renegade soldiers sought in the
failed coup and seized $5,000 dollars in pesos which Brig. Gen.
Rodolfo Biazon said was apparently earmarked to finance another
coup attempt.
   Oxales said information given by one of the three, Capt.
Francisco Baula, helped lead to today's arrest. He did not
elaborate.
   Today's arrest brought to 74 the number of alleged right-wing
extremists taken into custody in recent weeks. They include key
officers who helped seize military and media facilities in Manila
and central Luzon during Honasan's coup attempt.
   Honasan was arrested last December but escaped from a prison
ship in Manila Bay the following April. Honasan played a key role
in the February 1986 military-civilian revolt which toppled
President Ferdinand Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to office.
   But Honasan became disillusioned with Mrs. Aquino because of her
alleged failure to crush the Communist rebellion and rid the
government of corruption.
   Mrs. Aquino acknowledged certain failings during an emotional
eulogy for Joaquin ``Chino'' Roces, a newspaper publisher who
convinced her to run for office but two years later rebuked her
administration publicly for its failures.
   Roces, a leader in the struggle against Marcos, died Friday of
cancer at the age of 75. After receiving the Legion of Honor from
Mrs. Aquino last July, Roces publicly chided her for failing to
establish a ``new moral order'' after the Marcos government
collapsed.
   ``It hurt when he said it, but it had to be said,'' Mrs. Aquino
said, her voice breaking with emotion. ``And he was one with the
moral authority to say it. He has warned us that we, the friends of
democracy, shall have a worse time of it than the clear enemies of
the people if we fail the people.''
   The Aquino government has faced growing criticism in the press
over alleged corruption, mismanagement and the promotion of
officials chosen more for their loyalty to the administration than
their qualifications.
   In another development, the Philippine Constabulary announced
today it had seized a Chinese research vessel off eastern Luzon
after inspectors found weapons and ammunition aboard.
   The Science Research Vessel No. 1 was detained Monday off
Casiguran after three machine guns, eight assault rifles, two
semi-automatic rifles and 4,850 rounds of machine gun ammunition
were found aboard, Capt. Edgardo Ingusan of the 119th Philippine
Constabulary Company said.
   Communist rebels operate in the remote area, which has few
harbors and inadequate roads.
   In Manila, a Chinese embassy spokesman said the vessel dropped
anchor off Casiguran to escape a tropical storm and the weapons
were on board for self-defense.
   China maintains diplomatic relations with the Philippines. Last
April, Mrs. Aquino visited China and was assured by Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping of his government's support for her.

<TEXT>
   A 10-year-old Michigan girl has been
invited to spend a week in Panama as a guest of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega after the two became pen pals, a military official said.
   Sarah York of Negaunee, a town of 5,000 people in northern
Michigan, and her mother, Pauline York, were to begin their visit
today, said Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo.
   ``The girl has risen above the behavior of the adults that
actually direct U.S. politics,'' he said.
   Noriega, Panama's de facto ruler and head of the Defense Forces,
is under indictment in the United States on drug trafficking
charges. He has withstood U.S. economic sanctions against Panama
and diplomatic pressure to force him to resign.
   Lopez Grimaldo said the girl first wrote Noriega on March 3
after she saw him interviewed on television.
   ``I would like to see you in civilian clothes, without the
uniform,'' wrote the girl, who asked Noriega to recommend
literature about Central American politics and history.
   The youngster and the general have corresponded regularly and
exchanged gifts ever since, said Lopez Grimaldo, who made several
letters available to The Associated Press.
   He said the girl will attend the country's Second Agriculture
and Military Fair that begins today and meet with acting President
Manuel Solis Palma.
   The girl and Mrs. York plan to return to Michigan on Oct. 11, he
said.
   ``It is significant that this child has built a type of
spiritual relationship with a man who has been harrassed, badly
treated, persecuted and reviled by the adult politicians of her
country,'' Lopez Grimaldo said.

<HEAD>Vietnamese Siamese Twins In Satisfactory Condition After
Separation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two 7-year-old Siamese twins were in satisfactory
condition today after their separation in a 14-hour operation a day
earlier in Vietnam, a Japanese Red Cross official said.
   A team of 72 doctors and nurses separated twins Viet and Duc in
the operation at Tu Du Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly
Saigon. It was believed the first separation of Siamese twins who
had been joined for more than seven years.
   Yoshiaki Nemoto of the Japan Red Cross quoted Tadateru Konoe,
one of three Japanese observers in the operation, as saying the
twins were ``in satisfactory condition Wednesday morning.''
   The medical team ``will keep a round-the-clock vigil on the two
boys for four days'' until Saturday, Nemoto quoted Konoe as
reporting by phone from Ho Chi Minh City.
   The Japanese Red Cross provided some medical equipment and
medicine needed in the operation, Nemoto said.
   Kyodo News Service quoted a Vietnamese doctor as saying in Ho
Chi Minh City that ``it will take about a week to tell the
outcome'' of the operation.
   Viet and Duc were joined at the pelvis and had a single pair of
legs. With their two torsos, they shared a large bowel, anus,
bladder, genitals, one pair of kidneys and a major artery, leaving
doctors with the difficult ethical question of how to divide their
shared parts and give both a chance of survival.
   Japanese newspapers reported today that each twin received one
leg, while the single organs went to Duc, the more healthy twin.
Viet has been comatose since May 1986.
   Vietnamese officials have attributed a reported rise in the
number of births of Siamese twins in the country to the American
use of defoliants during the Vietnam War, including the central
highlands area where Viet and Duc were born in February 1981.
   The defoliants included Agent Orange, which contains a compound,
dioxin, known to produce birth defects in animals.

<HEAD>Student Government Shuts Down Campus Paper After Satire Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Editors at the California State
University campus here are wrangling with the student government
over censorship after the student politicians shut down the
newspaper over a satiric edition.
   The California State University, Long Beach Associated Students
Senate withdrew funding for The Union last week because of the
newspaper's satire supplement, ``The Grunion,'' which took as its
theme the ``Sexually Frustrated Male.''
   The issue featured phallic illustrations and a photograph of
three nearly nude cavorters.
   Union editor Gary Stark, who is appealing the decision to the
student judiciary, charged the Senate violated its own policies in
its Sept. 28 decision.
   ``Our bylaws specifically state that staffing and editorial
content shall not be subject to the review or approval of the A.S.
Senate,'' Stark said.
   Student body president Roger Thompson said there is no First
Amendment violation because the paper can continue without student
funding.
   ``The $10,000 we give the Union comes from student fees. I have
to ask myself, how appropriate is it to spend $10,000 on this?''
Thompson said.
   Journalism professor Ben Cunningham said there is friction
whenever campus papers are funded by student fees.
   ``It's an unholy alliance that invites this kind of thing to
occur,'' said Cunningham, adding that the editor exercised poor
judgment and the student government overreacted.
   ``If the politicians didn't want to pay for a student newspaper,
this wasn't the time to make the decision. What they did was to
make it very clearly a First Amendment issue,'' Cunningham said.
   The school's administration has remained neutral.

<HEAD>California Chain Pulls Tobacco Products From Shelves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   California's largest supermarket chain began
removing cigars, pipe tobacco and chewing tobacco from shelves
because the products are not labeled as cancer-causing in
compliance with a state law.
   Cigarettes are not involved in the action announced Tuesday by
Vons Cos. Inc. because they already carry a federally mandated
warning label. Several brands of chewing tobacco that carry such
labels also are exempt.
   ``It's the first time we are aware of that a supermarket has
taken product off the shelves in response to Proposition 65,'' said
Deputy Attorney General Craig C. Thompson, the state enforcement
coordinator for the law created by the November 1986 ballot
initiative.
   The law requires the state to identify products and substances
than can cause cancer, birth defects and sterility. Businesses must
warn the public of ``significant'' amounts of the substances.
   Vons has 336 stores in the central and southern parts of
California. It recently acquired 172 Safeway supermarkets in
Southern California.
   The removal of 17 tobacco products produced by five companies
was designed to comply with Proposition 65, said Vons spokeswoman
Vickie Sanders.
   On Friday, state Attorney General John K. Van de Kamp filed a
civil lawsuit against 25 tobacco manufacturers and eight food store
chains, including Vons. The suit claimed the companies failed to
warn consumers of the cancer risk of certain products.
   However, Ms. Sanders told the Los Angeles Times that the
decision to pull the products had nothing to do with the lawsuit.
   ``We did not do it without warning or notice to manufacturers.
This is not a sudden move on Vons' part,'' she said.
   Tobacco manufacturers and distributors were told in August that
Vons would require warning labels on products by Sept. 17, Ms.
Sanders said. That deadline later was extended until Monday, she
said.
   The tobacco industry hoped it could comply with the law by
posting signs in stores and other measures short of attaching
warning labels to their products.
   Norman F. Sharp, president of the Cigar Association of America
and the Pipe Tobacco Council, said in a statement from Washington,
D.C.: ``The warning message is, in fact, reaching the mass of cigar
and pipe tobacco purchasers throughout the state. We do not think
the producers' efforts, which have been timely and responsible, can
be legitimately faulted.''
   Mary Hernandez, assistant manager at Von's Westside Pavilion
store, said she finished pulling the cigars and other items from
shelves late Tuesday. So far, no customers had complained, she said.
   ``You will see bare shelves. There will be a sign up there
telling customers we apologize for the inconvenience, but it is a
necessary inconvenience,'' Ms. Sanders said.
   John Shepherd, a spokesman for Safeway Stores Inc., said the
chain, which has 221 stores in California, gave manufacturers until
Oct. 17 to label products or have shipments refused. Meantime, the
stores have posted warning signs near cigar, pipe and chewing
tobacco displays.

   PTL's trustee has accepted a $115 million
bid from a Canadian businessman for the Christian ministry's
assets, but the buyer, who is Jewish, hasn't said what he will do
with the remnants of Jim Bakker's empire.
   The decision Tuesday came down to who offered ``the most money
and the best terms,'' said bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton.
   ``I'd hoped we could get a bit more for it. But this is not a
bad price,'' said Benton, who spent nearly six months talking with
bidders.
   One of them was Bakker, who nearly a month ago failed to secure
the financing for his $172 million offer.
   Bakker gave a conditional blessing to the winning bid by Stephen
R. Mernick of Toronto.
   ``Tammy and I remain committed to the restoration of the
ministry of PTL,'' Bakker said in a statement. ``If the present
offer is agreeable to the creditors, the partners (PTL's major
donors) and the court, and God's will is satisfied with respect to
the ministry of PTL, we will be happy with that outcome.''
   Mernick, 34, will pay $50 million at closing, which the contract
set at no later than Dec. 31, and the balance over five years, said
his attorney, Joseph Kluttz.
   If approved by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in Columbia, S.C.,
Mernick will own the 500-acre Heritage USA, a Christian retreat and
theme park south of Charlotte in York County, S.C.; the PTL
satellite TV network; and 1,700 undeveloped acres in York County.
   PTL's religious functions have been separated from its other
operations, and the Heritage USA Church is leasing back its
facilities from PTL to continue on-site worship and Christian
broadcasting.
   Mernick, an Orthodox Jew who was celebrating the holiday Simchat
Torah, did not travel to Charlotte to attend Tuesday's new
conference announcing the winning bid.
   Kluttz said Mernick has interests in real estate, clothing,
garbage collection and landfills.
   ``His primary interest as a businessman is to get a maximum
return on his investment,'' Kluttz said.
   In a Sept. 15 letter to Benton, Mernick said he ``would welcome
the opportunity to meet with representatives of any group or groups
that are seriously interested in exploring ways of preserving or
enhancing the Christian orientation of parts or all of the existing
developed assets.''
   Aaron Grubner, Mernick's attorney in Toronto, told The Charlotte
Observer last month that Mernick wanted PTL because ``it's a large
tract of land, and I'm not sure those types of parcels are readily
available.''
   Mernick, who entered the negotiations a month ago, outbid fellow
Canadian Peter Thomas of Vancouver. Thomas offered $113 million,
$46 million of it in cash, but not all would have been payable
until September 1989.
   By signing Mernick's contract, Benton agreed to stop negotiating
with any other bidders and to file a motion with Bankruptcy Judge
Rufus Reynolds recommending Mernick's offer by Friday.
   Other bidders may still present offers directly to the court,
but Benton said his recommendation gives Mernick the upper hand.
   Reynolds has said a firm bid must be submitted by Oct. 14 or he
would order PTL's assets sold to pay creditors, who are estimated
to be owed more than $130 million. He is expected to hold a hearing
on the bid in about a month.
   An assistant to Reynolds, Susanne Robicsek, said the judge
``doesn't have any comment'' on the offer.
   PTL has been in bankruptcy reorganization since June 1987. Three
months earlier, Bakker resigned after he admitted having a sexual
encounter with Jessica Hahn in 1980 and disclosed that money was
paid to silence the former church secretary.
   Some PTL employees were relieved by Tuesday's announcement.
   The pastor of Heritage Village Church, the Rev. Sam Johnson,
said: ``The man is not buying the ministry. He is buying the assets
of Heritage USA. That's important to us because our objective is to
continue to preach the good news of Jesus Christ.''
   ``I'm glad we finally have a buyer and know which way we're
going,'' said Linda Gray, a security administrative assistant. ``I
think the whole staff feels like partying.''

   A $115 million bid by Toronto businessman
Stephen R. Mernick for the PTL ministry was accepted Tuesday by the
ministry's bankruptcy trustee. Other parties who sought to buy the
ministry included:
   _PTL founder and deposed leader Jim Bakker. Bakker claimed
throughout the summer he had a $100 million line of credit, and
later presented a $172 million bid. Though he appeared to be the
leading contender for a time, Bakker failed to meet several
deadlines for producing a $3 million down payment.
   _Charlotte, N.C., businessman George Shinn. Shinn, owner of the
newly formed Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball
Association and the Charlotte Knights Double A baseball team,
originally hoped to use part of the land to build a stadium for his
teams. Shinn never announced the amount of his bid, but published
reports put it around $75 million. He eventually entered a deal to
build a stadium a few miles from PTL.
   _Australian businessman Gavin Morehu. Morehu, described as a
millionaire Christian involved in the import-export business,
initially tendered a $200 million offer, but failed to come up with
$50 million in earnest money.
   _Canadian real estate tycoon Peter Thomas. Thomas, a native of
Vancouver, British Columbia, is a major stockholder in Century 21,
the real estate franchiser, and president of Samoth Capital Corp.
He offered $113 million for the ministry. He withdrew his bid as
Bakker seemed close to success, but re-entered later, and said
Tuesday he was disappointed with the outcome, which still must be
approved by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge. Thomas said he would
keep Heritage USA as a religious retreat.

   A Chinese research vessel was
detained off eastern Luzon after inspectors found weapons and
ammunition aboard, the Philippine Constabulary reported today.
   But a spokesman for the Chinese embassy said the weapons were
for self defense and that Filipino authorities told them the vessel
would be allowed to leave Thursday.
   Capt. Edgardo Ingusan of the 119th Philippine Constabulary
Company said ``Science Research Vessel No. 1'' was detained Monday
off Casiguran after three machine guns, eight assault rifles, two
semi-automatic rifles and 4,850 rounds of machine gun ammunition
were found aboard.
   Intelligence officers flew today to Casiguran, 135 miles
northeast of Manila, to inspect the vessel and question the
skipper, Capt. Chun Yu-xi.
   A constabulary report said the vessel's papers indicated it was
engaged in underwater research.
   Communist rebels operate in the remote area, which has few
harbors and inadequate roads.
   China maintains diplomatic relations with the Philippines. Last
April, Mrs. Aquino visited China and was assured by Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping of his government's support for her.
   Liu Xingshen, a Chinese embassy spokesman, said the ship dropped
anchor off Casiguran to avoid a tropical storm in the area. Liu
said the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said the ship
would be allowed to leave Thursday.
   ``I think if there are arms on this research ship, they are used
for self-defense to prevent attacks by pirates,'' Liu said.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices fell moderately on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average again lost 95.53 points, or
0.35 percent, following Tuesday's 44.51-point drop. The index
gained 72.25 points in the early morning, reaching 27,573.27, but
headed down and closed at 27,501.02 points.
   Since Oct. 1, the index has lost 518.18 points even though the
second half of the fiscal year has begun, when market trading
should be active, dealers said.
   ``There is no negative factor in the economy that should lead
the market to keep losing,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama with the Nikko
Securities. He said increased selling for profit-taking resulted in
the Nikkei's decline today.
   ``Also, there was some cautiousness among investors before the
(announcement of the) U.S. umemployment rate'' for September,
scheduled for Friday, he said.
   But Shimoyama implied the major market-affecting factor was
participants' uncertainty about ailing Emperor Hirohito, whose
condition was reported stable but serious. The 87-year-old Hirohito
has been bedridden and continues to hemorrhage since he vomited
blood Sept. 19.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was estimated
at 1 billion shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 133.48 yen,
up 0.33 yen from Tuesday's close of 133.15 yen. Opening slightly
lower at 133.40 yen, the currency ranged within a tight range of
133.40-133.57 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate was moving very little,'' said a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Participants remained on the sidelines as the release of the
U.S. unemployment figure approaches, and were just adjusting the
amount of currencies they've had,'' he said.

   Heavy readers take heart. The long-awaited second
edition of ``The Oxford English Dictionary'' will weigh in at a
whopping 137 pounds worth of words.
   The venerable OED, world's biggest dictionary, is getting bigger.
   ``We are sure we will sell a lot because the dictionary is the
standard work of reference on the English language and any
substantial library will have to have it,'' said Ludo Craddock,
promotions executive of the Oxford University Press.
   The tumescent tome will span 22,000 pages, fill 20 voluminous
volumes and sell for about $2,500.
   The publishing house, founded in 1584, describes the dictionary
as its most adventurous project since it began the first edition in
the 19th century.
   But the first edition had a mere 44 million words of text and
the second has 59 million. There are 290,500 main entries on
different words, a 15 percent increase from the first edition.
   In addition, there are 157,000 combinations and derivatives and
169,000 phrases making a total of 616,500 ``word forms'' which are
defined. The 1928 edition had 414,825.
   The OED was first published in parts between 1884 and 1928 and a
supplement of new words and words missed the first time was added
in 1933. Together, they made up 13 volumes.
   The last of four additional volumes was finished in 1986 by New
Zealander Robert Burchfield, who spent 29 years on the project. The
publishers had expected it to take seven years.
   Since Burchfield's four volumes, 5,000 new words have been added
_ ``most of them at the beginning of the alphabet as Burchfield was
continually adding as he progressed,'' said Craddock.
   James Murray, a Scottish village tailor's son, was the
dictionary's original editor. He had a flowing white beard and
worked in a garden shed from slips of paper. He died in 1915 when
he was halfway through the letter `S.'
   The new edition also has been computerized, with the vocabulary
of English since 1150 A.D. on a single data base to be available by
home computer.
   The first advertisements for the dictionary are now appearing in
Britain and the United States. The publishers are reluctant to
divulge any other details about the dictionary before it is
officially launched on March 29.
   But this book is big. According to Craddock, the new OED is
``more than five times the size of any other dictionary of the
English language.''

   Four Navy airman were missing at sea and
presumed dead after a search off the coast failed to turn up
survivors of a nighttime crash of a Navy helicopter, authorities
said.
   The SH-3H Sea King helicopter crashed early Tuesday about 80
miles off San Diego while involved in maneuvers with the aircraft
carrier USS Ranger, a Navy spokesman said.
   An 18-hour search for the crew was called off at dusk Tuesday.
   The craft's four crew members were assigned to Antisubmarine
Helicopter Squadron 14 based at North Island Naval Air Station,
said Navy spokesman Fred Wilson.
   The co-pilot was identified as Lt. j.g. Dean A. Patrick, 26, of
Hesperia, Mich. Two crewmen were identified as John J. Taylor, 22,
of Lawrenceburg, Ind., and John Palmquist, 22, of Columbus, Ohio,
both aviation anti-submarine warfare operators, 2nd class.
   The name of the pilot was withheld pending notification of
relatives.
   The crew was conducting ``plane guard'' duty for the Ranger in
which choppers take to the air during carrier flight operations so
they will be in position to quickly rescue ditched fliers if their
planes go down.
   The cause of accident, which occurred shortly after midnight,
was under investigation, Wilson said.
   The Sikorsky-built Sea Kings were introduced to the Navy fleet
in 1965 as the mainstay anti-submarine helicopter assigned to
carrier air wings, and later, to other warships fitted with landing
platforms. The choppers also are used for search and rescue
missions.
   The Navy has begun to replace the older Sea Kings with SH-60B
Seahawks, also built by Sikorsky.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A father who lost his son in a hit-and-run
accident turned detective when he discovered that the man banned
from driving for killing his 14-year-old was driving again.
   Bernard Proctor tracked Gordon Stratton with a camera and video
equipment in a specially converted van to prove Stratton was
violating the driving ban, a court heard this week.
   His evidence helped send Stratton back to prison.
   ``I sat in my van and used a telescopic lens to get pictures of
him coming out of a pub and driving away,'' Proctor said.
   ``I lost count of the footage of video film I used but it was
all worth it.''
   Stratton, 29, pleaded guilty to two charges of driving while
disqualified and was sentenced in south London's Croydon Crown
Court on Tuesday to nine months in jail. He was also banned from
driving for another year.
   Prosecutor Peter Finnigan said that Tim Proctor was killed in
1982 and Stratton was sent to prison in 1983 for nine months and
banned from driving for 4{ years for causing deaths by reckless
driving. He was again disqualified from driving for three years in
1985.
   Finnigan said Proctor heard Stratton was still driving, and
tracked him for several months to gain the evidence he handed over
to police.
   The judge, Sir Donald Farquharson, told Stratton: ``What is
particularly distressing is that having caused the death of a young
boy one would have thought that in those circumstances you would
have been particularly careful not to get involved in driving
offences again.''
   Proctor said Stratton should have got a longer jail term.
   ``He is clearly a danger on the roads,'' he said after the
hearing.

<HEAD>Incidents at O'Hare Raise New Safety Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new series of mistakes by air traffic
controllers at O'Hare International Airport has plagued one of the
world's busiest airports, which already is the subject of a federal
safety investigation, officials say.
   Controllers at the airport made one error Sunday and two Friday,
bringing the number of recorded errors at O'Hare this year to 29,
officials said Tuesday.
   By comparison, Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport has
had six errors this year, and Washington's National Airport two.
   In one incident Friday, two Air Wisconsin jets came near each
other when a controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an
order to descend from 14,000 feet to 11,000 feet, a Federal
Aviation Administration spokesman said.
   In the day's other incident, an American Airlines jet and a
Delta Air Lines jet came within 400 feet vertically and a mile
horizontally when the pilot of the American apparently failed to
repeat an order to reduce speed and the controller did not seek
confirmation, the Chicago Tribune reported today.
   On Sunday, two United Airlines jets came within 500 feet of each
other horizontally after the pilot of one plane apparently followed
an order intended for the other, the newspaper said.
   The FAA requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum
of three miles horizontally or 1,000 feet vertically.
   The incidents occurred just two months after the National
Transportation Safety Board issued a report saying that chronic
understaffing, mandatory overtime, outdated equipment and
inadequate training had contributed to mistakes at O'Hare.
   And now NTSB officials are worried that the trend has not been
reversed, said regional director Carl Dinwiddie.
   The FAA, which has 90 days to respond to the NTSB report, has
not yet replied, said an NTSB spokesman in Washington.
   Both agencies are investigating the recent errors.
   Joe Bellino, regional representative of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, said O'Hare's radar room on Friday was ``a
zoo.''
   With Friday's 3,842 takeoffs and landings _ 11 below the record
set the day before _ there should have been 18 journeyman
controllers and several ``developmental'' controllers on duty.
   But Bellino said there were only 14 controllers in both
categories, and the problem was made worse when the controllers who
made the errors were temporarily relieved of their duties, giving
those who remained even more responsibilities.
   ``We had airplanes all over the sky,'' Bellino said. ``We were
buried all day long.''
   The FAA could not immediately say how many controllers were on
duty Friday, but spokesman Donald Zochert said the total number of
controllers working at the airport has risen from 87 last year to
94 as of Sept. 1. There are now six new developmental controllers
and one new journeyman.

   A story that refers to cruel conduct by a Japanese
soldier during World War II was pulled from a high school textbook
and replaced with an excerpt from ``My Fair Lady'' after
politicians protested to the publisher.
   Sanseido Co., the publisher of the English textbook, decided to
replace the story after members of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party complained that it was inappropriate.
   But the change has led to renewed charges that political and
government influence is being used to gloss over textbook accounts
of Japanese atrocities during World War II.
   The five-page lesson titled ``War'' in Sanseido's ``First
English Series II'' begins with a conversation among Southeast
Asians.
   ```Which nation is the most cruel?' `The Germans.' `No. No. The
Japanese,''' the lesson says.
   The lesson then tells a story about a Japanese soldier in
Malaysia who grabbed a baby from its mother and ``threw the baby up
into the air and ran his sword through it. The baby died on the
spot.''
   The lesson goes on to say, ``War makes people cruel. So we
cannot say one nation is more cruel than another.''
   It also mentions the case of Siamese twins from Vietnam, Duc and
Viet, whose deformity may have been caused by the defoliant Agent
Orange used by the U.S. military in Vietnam.
   ``These stories are sad, but sometimes we have to face
uncomfortable things to make our life better,'' the lesson said.
   Fukuo Ishinabe, director of Sanseido's school textbook
department, said the story was aimed at promoting understanding for
international peace.
   But he said the company agreed to replace the story with an
excerpt from ``My Fair Lady,'' the popular musical, because ``any
material that causes misunderstanding is not good.''
   Liberal Democratic Party politicians claimed the story
exaggerated Japanese soldiers' cruelty during World War II and
lacked historic and scientific background.
   ``We thought no teacher should use such a textbook as this,''
said Iwao Kudo of the Education Division of the party's Policy
Research Council.
   The 120-page textbook was approved by Education Ministry
examiners in July. All textbooks used in Japanese schools must be
approved by the ministry, which often demands changes.
   Other Asian nations have in recent years protested many of those
changes, including changing Japan's ``invasion'' of mainland Asia
to ``advance'' and the toned-down description of the Nanking
Massacre, in which Japanese soldiers killed or raped up to 300,000
Chinese.
   History texts also fail to mention Japan's biological
experiments on war prisoners in Manchuria. Next year for the first
time, one of the 18 approved high school history texts will include
Japan's chemical warfare activities during the war, the ministry's
textbook division said.
   Publishers cannot be forced to make changes once a textbook is
approved, except to correct errors, but Sanseido agreed to replace
its war story, said Hiroyasu Hasegawa of the ministry's textbook
division.
   Shoju Oba, an official of the Japan Teacher's Union, criticized
the deletion.
   ``Authors should be able to publish textbooks with their own
choice of materials free of government inspection in the first
place,'' he said. ``In this respect, the LDP's claim and the
decision of the ministry and the publisher could lead to something
very dangerous.''
   Mitsu Kaneko, a Japan Socialist Party member of parliament,
called on the Education Ministry to restore the story to the text.

<HEAD>NJ Inaugurates Head Start-Funded Center For Children With AIDS</HEAD>

   On a rubble-strewn lot in a poor
neighborhood, officials dedicated a day care center for children
with AIDS that will serve as the model for similar centers
elsewhere.
   ``We think this will be an exemplary project for other cities
and counties,'' said Sydney J. Olson, the assistant secretary of
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, who attended the
dedication Tuesday.
   The center is the first in the United States to operate with
federal Head Start and state money. Similar centers will open soon
in Los Angeles, Boston, Baltimore and Alaska, Ms. Olson said.
   ``Poor children with a terrible disease are a very easy
constituency to forget,'' said Gov. Thomas H. Kean. ``This center,
with its Head Start background, will help children turn trouble
into opportunity.''
   Ms. Olson said New Jersey was chosen for the first center in
part because of the state's high number of AIDS cases.
   ``We desperately need this program,'' said state Human Services
Commissioner Drew Altman.
   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control, New Jersey
has the second-highest number of reported cases of children under
age 13 with AIDS, 163. New York has the most, 364.
   New Jersey ranks fifth in the nation with 5,130 reported cases
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, behind New York,
California, Florida and Texas, according to the CDC. There are a
total of 74,447 cases nationwide, with 1,185 of them among children
under 13.
   AIDS is transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, most
commonly during intimate sexual contact or the sharing of
hypodermic needles. Most children who have the disease contract it
in the womb and are born to women who are intravenous drug users.
   The Head Start center, in a brick building in north-central
Newark, is the result of efforts by community groups, businesses
and local, state and federal governments.
   It will be operated by Babyland Nursery, a neighborhood-based
organization that cares for more than 300 children at three centers
and has programs for children who are abused or face family
violence.
   The center will open Nov. 5 with 10 children ranging from a few
months to 3 years old, and with about six staff members, said Mary
Smith, executive director of Babyland.
   Head Start is a child development program that provides
education, health and social services for low-income children,
mainly ages 3 to 5.
   In addition to child care, Smith said, the center will aim at
educating the community about the need to give children with AIDS
the same love as any child.
   ``These kids will be kissed and hugged and treated in the same
fashion as all our other Babyland children,'' she said.
   She said care-givers will use no special protective wear, since
AIDS cannot be transmitted through casual contact.
   ``When we first started this program we thought (getting AIDS)
would be a real concern,'' she said. ``But actually we had
care-givers from our other programs volunteering to do this
program. They have so much compassion for these children that they
want to work in it.''
   The center eventually will serve up to 30 children, who will be
referred by state agencies working with AIDS victims. The children
will receive daily physical exams and regular treatment from
Newark's United Hospitals Medical Center.
   In the first year of operation, Health and Human Services will
contribute $120,000 in Head Start money to the center; $160,000
more will come from the state.

<TEXT>
   There is an upbeat mood in this northern
Italian fashion capital, thanks to good weather, good exchange
rates at the bank and good clothes on the runway.
   This optimistic feeling was apparent at Monday evening's
black-tie gala at Milan's famed La Scala Opera House in honor of
the Italian fashion industry.
   Highlight of the evening was a concert by Italian soprano Katia
Ricciarelli, who sang arias from Italy's rich operatic repertoire.
   Sitting in the royal box was Prince Albert of Belgium and his
Italian wife, Princess Paola, while the rest of the theater was
packed with Milan's beautiful people from blue-eyed, silver-haired
Giorgio Armani, to one of film director Federico Fellini's favorite
actresses, Sandra Milo.
   Following the concert, the glitzy crowd gathered in the foyer
for a buffet supper, a perfect opportunity to show off their
evening finery.
   The current look is short black velvet cocktail dresses with
taffeta pouf skirts, and sheer black embroidered stockings worn
with spike heels.
   However, by next season these outfits will be relegated to the
back of the closet to make room for the long, languid skirts and
pants that are the hits of the spring-summer 1989 collections being
presented this week.
   The new look is in stark contrast to the short sexy numbers that
were displayed at La Scala. Pale creamy colors, gossamer fabrics,
flat shoes and hemlines that graze the ankle make up the spring
style.
   There's nothing controversial about these clothes, which should
appeal to trend-setters and conservatives alike.
   Flamboyant Gianni Versace toned down his tough sexy style, while
Krizia gave a new softness to her sleek man-tailored suits, and
simplified her extravagant evening wear. Even the ``enfants
terribles'' Karl Lagerfeld and Franco Moschino succumbed to the new
calm mood.
   The Milan fashion vista is expanding, thanks to Laura Biagiotti,
who was the first designer to bring Italian clothes to China, when
she presented her collection in Beijing in April.
   Celebrating her historic visit, twenty Chinese models returned
the favor by appearing in her Oriental inspired spring collection.
   Sitting in the front row was the Chinese ambassador to Italy, Du
Dong, and a delegation of Chinese trade officials.
   There is talk that Biagiotti, a latter day Marco Polo, may
produce some of her famed cashmere creations in China.

   The vote approving continued sales of
alcohol here was a reaction against pressure from ``drys'' after a
bus crash blamed on drunken driving killed 27 people, most of them
children, a ``wet'' says.
   ``This vote is a statement that we're happy with the community
we live in,'' Chuck Webster, leader of Citizens for the Legal Sale
of Alcohol, said after the referendum Tuesday in northern
Kentucky's Carroll County and this county seat.
   In Carrollton, 1,211 voted to continue liquor sales; 450 voted
to ban them. Countywide, 1,173 voted for the status quo, and 750
voted against it.
   ``I'm sorry we didn't win, but we gave the people the
opportunity to say what they wanted,'' said Trudy Mahoney, a
spokeswoman for the anti-alcohol Citizens for a Better Life.
   The referendum was prompted by the fiery May 14 crash of a
church bus and a pickup truck, which killed 24 children. The pickup
truck driver, Larry Mahoney, has been charged with murder, drunken
driving and other counts.
   ``A lot of people took it personally,'' Webster said of the
accident. ``They felt by voting no, it would be accepting some
responsibility for the bus crash.
   ``The man driving the truck was not even from Carroll County. We
would have been having to take that rap for him and we weren't
ready to do that.''
   About 59 percent of those eligible to vote cast ballots,
surpassing the turnout for most presidential elections, said County
Clerk John Tilley.
   ``The voter turnout really pleased me,'' Webster said. ``I've
said all along the greater the turnout, the greater the margin of
victory (for us) will be.''
   Debbie Roeder, a member of Citizens for a Better Life, said
earlier Tuesday that the referendum had been desired for many years.
   ``The bus crash probably did prompt people into action, whereas
before they thought, `What's the sense?''' she said.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Fire On Kabul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas fired rockets into Kabul today
during morning rush hour, killing 11 people and injuring 26 others
in the capital city, the Tass news agency reported.
   Also today, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reiterated
Soviet complaints that Pakistan is to blame for violations of the
U.N. accord providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.
   ``All indications are that in Islamabad, they have a very flawed
idea of international law, state-to-state relations and
treaty-based commitments,'' the newspaper said.
   The Soviet Union said last week it had halted the withdrawal of
its troops from Afghanistan, citing violations of the accord.
   Pravda said the Afghan government has registered more than 1,500
violations of the accord with U.N. monitors.
   Tass said 23 rockets were fired from positions northwest of
Kabul during morning rush hour. It said 11 people died and 26
others were wounded.
   Under the accord signed April 14, the Soviet Union agreed to
withdraw its 100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan in exchange for a
pledge of non-interference by Pakistan and other countries that
have been aiding the guerrillas. The guerrillas are not party to
the agreement.
   Half of the Soviet force in Afghanistan was withdrawn between
May 15 and Aug. 15, and the Soviet Union has until Feb. 15 to
complete the pullout.
   But the Soviet Union charges Pakistan has not moved to shut down
guerrilla camps on its territory and still serves as a conduit for
U.S.-supplied arms.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced one
pro-Soviet government with another and remained to fight the
anti-Marxist insurgents. More than 13,000 Soviet soldiers have been
killed in that time and 35,000 wounded.

<HEAD>Leftist Terror Group Grapo Says It Killed Madrid Policeman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tiny leftist terror group GRAPO has
claimed responsibility for slaying a national police officer, a
radio network reported today.
   The private network SER said it received an anonymous telephone
call Tuesday night in which a man claimed the killing on behalf of
the extreme-left terror group, the 1st of October Anti-fascist
Resistance Group, known by its Spanish acronym GRAPO.
   Two men and a woman took part in the killing early Tuesday in
which one man shot to death a 47-year-old policeman who had been on
duty at an identity card office, police said.
   The man also slightly injured another police officer and a man
and a woman during the shooting, police said.
   Police said GRAPO was particularly active in Spain in 1976-77
when they claimed the killings of 12 policeman and more than 30
terrorist attacks including bombings, shootings and kidnappings.
   Most GRAPO members were jailed in the late 1970s and early
1980s, police said.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told reporters Tuesday that
the GRAPO unit that killed the policeman was made up of two men and
two women.
   Eyewitnesses positively identified three of them in police
pictures as Laureano Ortega Ortega, Encarnacion Leon Lara and Maria
Jesus Romero.
   The second man has not been identified by police, he said.
   Police have sought Ortega and the two women since they were
identified as having been involved in the May 27 shooting death of
a businessman in the northwestern port city of La Coruna.
   The GRAPO group claimed responsibility for that shooting a few
days later in a letter to a newspaper in the southeastern city of
Valencia, police said.
   The three are also wanted for other attacks.
   Corcuera said the four-person GRAPO unit was the sole remaining
active component of the group.

<TEXT>
   Officials in several Asian countries breathed a
sigh of relief today after the U.S. House failed to override a veto
of limits on textile imports, but they fretted over U.S.
protectionist sentiment that gave rise to the bill.
   ``The textile bill is dead,'' trumpeted Hong Kong's director of
trade, Michael Sze.
   But, he added, ``the textile lobby is not going to give up. It
will be looking for ways to make protection for the textiles
industry more palatable to U.S. legislators. This could seriously
threaten Hong Kong's trading interests.''
   In the latest statistics available in Hong Kong, the British
colony exported $3.4 billion worth of clothing and accessories and
$116 million worth of textile fabrics to the United States in 1986.
   The House voted 272-152 in favor of overriding President
Reagan's veto of the bill. The tally fell 11 votes short of the
two-thirds majority needed to override the veto and impose the
restrictions.
   The bill would have frozen 1988 textile and apparel imports at
last year's level and limited growth to 1 percent annually
beginning in 1989. It also would have capped imports of non-rubber
footwear with no provision for future increases.
   Asian countries that sell billions of dollars worth of textiles
and clothing to the United States had expressed alarm as the bill
moved through Congress, criticizing it as protectionist and
unwarranted.
   ``Our concern has been resolved as the effort by the House to
override the presidential veto has failed,'' Mitsuaki Hayashi, a
spokesman for Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
said today.
   Japan exported $118 million worth of textiles to the United
States in 1987, and the ministry had said earlier the U.S.
legislation violated international trade agreements and would hurt
future accords.
   The Foreign Ministry also said it welcomed the
``anti-protectionist efforts made by President Reagan and his
administration.'' But a ministry statement also noted that nearly
two-thirds of the House had voted for a bill that ``contains very
restrictive and discriminatory articles that are not compatible
with free trade.''
   In Thailand, the Foreign Ministry's deputy spokesman,
Prachyadavi Tavedikul, said both Americans and Thais would benefit
from the upheld veto.
   ``We favor free trade. Our people and Americans will gain from
lower textile prices,'' Tavedikul said.

<HEAD>Government Looking at Solidarity Spokesman's U.S. Testimony</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor will look at statements made
by Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz at a U.S.
congressional hearing last month to see if any Polish law was
violated, the government has said.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Tuesday that is was
``peculiar'' for a Polish citizen to appear before a foreign
government and give testimony about affairs in Poland, but he did
not know if any laws were violated.
   The Foreign Ministry planned to establish the facts of the
testimony and a prosecutor will examine the statements for possible
legal violations, Urban said at his weekly news conference.
   Onyszkiewicz, a mathematics instructor at Warsaw University who
has been Solidarity's spokesman since 1981, returned to Poland on
Sunday after a trip to the United States. He was received there by
President Reagan and appeared before a congressional hearing on
Sept. 23.
   During the U.S. visit, Onyszkiewicz urged continued American
pressure on Poland to bring about legal recognition of Solidarity,
the East bloc's first independent trade unon which was banned in
1981 after the imposition of martial law.
   Onyszkiewicz and Jan Nowak, director of the Polish-American
Congress, an organization of Americans of Polish descent, testified
before a congressional committee about human rights in Poland and
treatment of Poles elsewhere, including the Soviet Union.
   The appearance before Congress by Onyszkiewicz was the subject
of criticism in the government-controlled press, which said he was
appearing as a employee reporting to his employer.
   Polish officials frequently criticize U.S. support of Solidarity
over the past several years, saying it makes the banned union an
agent of a foreign power.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
in quiet European trading today. Gold prices barely moved.
   Dealers said the dollar is in a moderate upward trend while the
market waits for Friday's scheduled release of American
unemployment figures for September.
   They said the figures will have no major impact on the dollar if
they show, as expected, a slight decline from August's unemployment
rate of 5.6 percent.
   ``There is no news to trade on,'' said one Frankfurt dealer.
``The market seems to be finished for the year.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.33 yen to a closing 133.48. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 133.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday,
were:
   _1.8655 West German marks, up from $1.8610
   _1.5840 Swiss francs, up from $1.5775
   _6.3540 French francs, up from $6.3285
   _2.1027 Dutch guilders, up from $2.0950
   _1,390.50 Italian lire, up from $1,385.875
   _1.2080 Canadian dollars, down from $1.20965
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6925, slightly cheaper for
buyers than late Tuesday's $1.6945.
   Currency dealers predicted the pound would soften because of
nervousness following the government's decision Tuesday to order
the Kuwait Investment Office to reduce its stake in British
Petroleum Co. PLC.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $397.50 a troy ounce, up
from the $397.45 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $397.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $396.90, unchanged from late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.77 a troy ounce to close at
a bid $400.46.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.22 a troy
ounce, down marginally from Tuesday's $6.23.

<HEAD>Party Leader Announces Leadership Shakeup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Stipe Suvar
has announced a plan to overhaul the party leadership, perhaps
replacing up to one-third of the 165-member Central Committee.
   Suvar said on Sarajevo television Tuesday night that the ruling
Presidium would propose the changes to the Central Committee, which
is to hold a crucial session on Oct. 17.
   ``Very soon new people will be brought into the Central
Committee of the League of Communists and its presidium,'' Suvar
said, according to a dispatch from the official Tanjug news agency.
   He said at the forthcoming meeting the party Presidium ``will
strive ... to determine the criteria of possible responsibility of
its members'' for Yugoslavia's economic and political crisis.
   ``If it fails in this, the Central Committee will assume this
role and anyone who does not win two-thirds of votes of the
membership of the Central Committee will leave this body,'' the
party chief declared.
   He added 43 members of the Central Committee and the presidium
so far have been charged with lack of responsibility.
   The replacement of one-third of the Central Committee is the
maximum permitted by the party statute, except at a party congress.
The party presidium has 23 members.
   Suvar announced that a similar overhaul was expected in the
party leaderships of Yugoslavia's six republics and two autonomous
provinces.
   There have been increasing calls for top-level personnel changes
in the party leadership. Leaders have been blamed for failing to
stop ethnic tensions between ethnic Albanians and Slavs in the
restive Kosovo province and the deteriotating economic and
political situation.
   Yugoslavia is burdened with a 217 percent annual inflation, a 15
percent unemployment rate and a $21 billion foreign debt.
   On Tuesday, about 5,000 workers from the Rakovica industrial
suburb of Belgrade marched on Parliament, protesting low wages and
sagging living standards. Several hundred women did the same this
morning, protesting low standards of living.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy in Laos said today it
is trying to determine the fate of two Americans arrested after
they tried to advertise a $2.4 million reward for the return of
U.S. soldiers in Indochina.
   An embassy spokesman, contacted by telephone in Vientiane, said
the embassy received no response to a note sent to the Laotian
Foreign Ministry asking about the status of the Americans, who were
seized by authorities Sunday.
   Donna Long, 45, and James Copp, 43, had planned to float
thousands of dollars down the Mekong River offering the reward to
any Laotian, Cambodian or Vietnamese who brought an American
prisoner of war to the International Red Cross.
   The two had also planned to cross to the Laotian bank of the
boundary-marking river and advertise the award to local villagers.
   Ross Petzing, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said
Tuesday the two were being held at Ban Sing Samphan in the southern
Laotian province of Champasak. He could not confirm whether they
were still in the village today or had been moved.
   Long, of Jacksonville, N.C., has described herself as an MIA-POW
activist and revealed her plan Sunday to The Associated Press
before making the trip to the river. She was traveling with Copp, a
schoolteacher and Vietnam war veteran from Hampstead, N.C.
   Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel manager who visited the
Americans in Laos Tuesday, said she saw them but was not allowed to
speak to them.
   She said they were being held in a small house in the village.
She said authorities had told her Monday that the two would be
released within three days, but Tuesday refused to say when they
would be freed.
   Pornthipa said the hotel management felt responsible for the two
because they had made contact with the hotel before making the trip
on the river in a rented boat. The Americans speak neither Thai or
Lao and have limited knowledge of the area.
   The two carried $3,000 in single bills as well as some Russian
and Indonesian currency. Bills were stamped in red with the reward
offer and placed in plastic packets.
   The Mekong River forms a boundary with Thailand and then flows
on to both Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The reward money is being offered through the National Steering
Committee for American War Veterans, a private MIA-POW group. The
group says the money has been pledged by 21 Congressmen and the
American Defense Institute, another group concerned with the MIA
issue.
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
from the Indochina war in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three
Indochinese governments deny holding any live Americans.

<HEAD>U.S. Rep. MacKay Wins Democratic Race To Oppose Mack</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay said after
winning the Democratic Senate runoff that he would try to heal
wounds from the divisive race while looking ahead to a ``mainstream
versus extreme'' contest with Republican Connie Mack.
   MacKay said he would meet in Tallahassee today with state
Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter, the defeated Democratic
candidate who pledged to support MacKay less than a week after
accusing the third-term congressman of running the nastiest
campaign in Florida history.
   Unofficial returns from Tuesday's runoff gave MacKay 362,234, or
52 percent of the vote, to Gunter's 330,297, or 48 percent.
   Mack, a former Cape Coral bank president and grandson of the
baseball Hall of Fame manager, is a well-funded conservative whose
candidacy is drawing national Republican help. Mack and MacKay will
face each other on the November ballot for the seat held by
Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles, who is retiring after three terms.
   ``We are the candidacy that can beat Connie Mack,'' MacKay said
Tuesday night. ``I see this election as mainstream versus extreme.''
   Mack agreed that voters faced an ideological decision.
   ``I think the voters in Florida are going to have a very clear
choice between the liberal Buddy MacKay and the conservative Connie
Mack,'' he said.
   The Senate runoff climaxed twisting events that began last
December, when Chiles, 58, announced he wouldn't seek re-election,
saying he was burned out by the Senate and didn't like the high
cost of running for re-election.
   Popular former two-term Gov. Reubin Askew then entered the race
against Mack. But Askew, well ahead in all polls, withdrew May 7,
saying he didn't like all the time spent raising funds.
   Gunter and MacKay jumped in after Askew pulled out, and they ran
one-two in the Sept. 6 primary. But neither received a majority,
making a runoff necessary.
   MacKay, a lawyer from a wealthy landowning family, was endorsed
by Askew, 1986 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Steve Pajcic,
third-place primary finisher Rep. Dan Mica and fourth-place
finisher state Sen. Patricia Frank.
   The runoff campaign was filled with negative advertising and
sharp exchanges in debates, and Democratic officials worried that
Mack would face a crippled opponent in the general election.
   MacKay, 55, attacked Gunter's integrity for his practice each
election of using campaign contributions from the insurance
industry he regulates, including from two companies that later
collapsed in corruption. He also charged that Gunter voted against
desegregation 15 years ago.
   Gunter, 54, charged that MacKay's congressional record betrayed
Israel, Social Security and anti-drug efforts, and he claimed
MacKay was being supported by corrupt defense contractors.
   MacKay warned that the well-funded Mack could exploit Gunter's
alleged ethics problems. Mack, meanwhile, went on the attack
against MacKay, running television and newspaper ads charging:
``Hey Buddy, You're liberal!''
   Gunter lost a 1974 Democratic Senate runoff and won a 1980
Senate runoff only to lose in the general election.

<HEAD>Coup Leader Given Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of two military coups last year was
given a promotion in the army today as this South Pacific nation
approached its first anniversary as a republic.
   Sitiveni Rabuka was third in the army hierachy and a lieutenant
colonel when he staged his first coup May 14, 1987. He mounted a
second takeover four months later and then elevated himself to the
rank of brigadier-general.
   Friday marks the first anniversary of his declaration that Fiji,
a former British colony and once a staunch member of the
Commonwealth, had severed its ties with Britain to become a
republic.
   To mark the event, President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau announced
today that Rabuka now holds the rank of major-general. Ganilau was
the country's former governor-general, and as such official
representative of Britain's Queen Elizabeth 11.
   There was no immediate explanation for the promotion. Ganilau
had opposed Rabuka's aim to change the constitution to give
preference to ethnic Melanesian Fijians in a future parliament over
the Indian community, which has a majority in the 715,000
population.
   Indigenous Fijians account for 47 percent while Indians,
descendants of indentured sugar plantation laborers, comprise 49
percent. Rabuka staged the coups following weeks of civil unrest
against Indian businesses that is widely believed to have been
instigated by an extremist Fijian group.
   Rabuka remains chief of the army and head of the home affairs
ministry, a powerful position because it puts him in charge of
security.
   Rabuka, 40, staged his first coup and overthrew the
multi-racial, Indian-domination government of Timoci Bavadra, just
one month after Bavadra was elected in free elections.
   Four months later, Rabuka carried out a second coup against an
interim government. Rabuka since has handed power to a nominally
civilian government.

<HEAD>Cinematographer Lucien Ballard Dies At 84</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cinematographer Lucien Ballard,
whose high-contrast imagery brought a sharp edge to such films as
``True Grit'' and ``The Wild Bunch,'' died of injuries from a
traffic accident. He was 84.
   Ballard died Saturday at Eisenhower Medical Center, two days
after he collided with a tractor while riding his bicycle near his
home, his son, Tony Ballard, said Tuesday.
   The Oklahoma native, whose career spanned nearly 50 years, shot
more than 100 films, ranging from such serious efforts as ``The
Caretakers'' for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, to
two-reel comedies starring The Three Stooges.
   One of Hollywood's most distinguished cameramen, he worked with
such directors as Sam Peckinpah, Stanley Kubrick, Henry Hathaway,
Dorothy Arzner and Josef von Sternberg.
   But despite an illustrious career, Ballard never received the
industry's top honor, the Academy Award. Although nominated for
``The Caretakers'' in 1963, he lost to James Wong Howe for ``Hud.''
   Two of his most renowned Westerns, Peckinpah's ``The Wild
Bunch,'' and Hathaway's ``True Grit,'' were both filmed in 1969.
Some in Hollywood believed they may have canceled each other out in
the Oscar race for best cinematography that year. ``True Grit''
garnered a best actor Oscar for John Wayne.
   Ballard was planning to go into the lumber business when he
discovered moviemaking after a script girl he was dating took him
to a three-day party whose host was actress Clara Bow.
   Soon thereafter he visited Paramount studios, landing a job as a
film cutter.
   He gained von Sternberg's attention while working as an
assistant camera operator, and the director used him on his 1930
film ``Morocco,'' starring Marlene Dietrich. Ballard also worked
with von Sternberg on ``The Devil Is a Woman'' and ``Crime and
Punishment.''
   Ballard married actress Merle Oberon in 1945, but the couple
divorced four years later.

<HEAD>Search Still On For Suspect in School Shooting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police were searching for a young drifter
believed to be the gunman who shot into an elementary school
playground and wounded a third-grade student before disappearing
into the woods.
   ``We know who the suspect is, but we don't know the motive,''
Lake County Sheriff Noel Griffin Jr. said Tuesday as officers
chopped weeds and cleared brush near Mascotte Elementary in their
search for the rifle used in the shooting of 9-year-old Leah
Wilibanks.
   The bearded man who fired on the approximately 25 children in
the schoolyard Monday wore military-style camouflage clothes and a
punk haircut, shaved on the sides and sticking straight up in the
center, investigators said.
   Griffin wouldn't say how the gunman was identified but did say
he was not a local resident.
   The child was listed in serious condition at Orlando Regional
Medical Center, said spokesman Joe Brown. She was hit by a single
bullet that passed through the upper right arm and chest, officials
said.
   Her grandmother, Dolly Chapman, said the girl asked late Monday:
``Why would somebody shoot me?''
   Mascotte Police Chief Don Page said, ``We don't exactly know the
motive of why anybody would shoot a young child like that.''
   Deputies were stationed at all elementary and grade schools in
this community of 1,600.
   Although scores of officers and residents had joined in the
search Monday, only a few officers were left searching for the
suspect by late Tuesday.
   The sheriff discouraged civilians from trying to take the law
into their own hands.
   ``They should watch their kids ... and leave it to us,'' he said.
   Children in Mascotte and the surrounding towns of Groveland,
Minneola and Clermont would not be allowed on playgrounds for a few
days, said Lake County School Superintendent Freddie Garner.
   Police were on hand to stand guard when the elementary school
reopened Tuesday, and counselors were brought in to talk to the
children. Doors to all schools in the district were locked, and all
principals were instructed to take extra precautions.
   Mascotte Elementary reported more than 150 children absent
Tuesday, out of an enrollment of about 415. Normal absenteeism is
about 20.

   A helicopter taking experts to check flood
damage in this city crashed, killing the pilot and a passenger,
authorities said today. The accident raised the flood's death toll
to 10.
   Officials had said Tuesday that 11 people drowned in the flood
the day before. But they revised that figure downward to eight
before the latest deaths raised the toll today to 10.
   False assumptions and communications problems caused the
mistake, said Bernard Lesterlin, deputy prefect in the region.
   Torrential rains sent a sudden five-foot-deep surge of water and
mud through the streets of this city of 130,000 people about 440
miles south of Paris.
   President Francois Mitterrand toured the devastated streets
Tuesday. About 100 of an estimated 50,000 people with damaged homes
chanted ``compensation, compensation,'' and Mitterrand said the
government would try to meet their needs.
   The French army sent more than 5,000 soldiers to help with
relief and supply work.

   Emperor Hirohito received two more blood
transfusions today, and doctors kept a close watch on the
87-year-old monarch as his fever worsened, palace officials said.
   Hirohito vomited blood Sept. 19 and has continued to discharge a
small amount of blood intermittently. He has received transfusions
totaling 11{ pints of blood.
   Kenji Maeda, head of general affairs at the Imperial Household
Agency, said doctors gave the emperor 0.23 pints of blood after a
transfusion of 0.4 pints earlier today. Maeda said doctors gave him
a smaller amount the second time because too much blood might
strain his heart.
   Hirohito's temperature continued to climb steadily in the
evening and reached 100.94 degrees. His normal temperature is about
95.9. His pulse was 104, up from 81 in the morning.
   The emperor has not been able to consume any solid food except a
few spoonfuls of porridge since falling sick. He is being fed
intravenously.
   Besides whole blood, palace physicians this week began
administering platelets to the emperor. They also sought to
increase intravenous nutrients, including glucose and protein, news
reports said.
   Crown Prince Akihito, Crown Princess Michiko and their two sons,
Prince Hiro and Prince Aya, were among the first family members to
visit Hirohito at his bedside today.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita visited Akihito at his Togu
Palace.
   Nearly 4 million people have signed registries around the
country to wish Hirohito a quick recovery. Fall festivals and other
celebrations have been canceled.

   A U.S. Navy diver beaten and
slain aboard a hijacked TWA jetliner said he hoped the hijackers
would kill him instead of his married Navy comrades, a witness
testified today.
   Diver Robert Stethem made the remark after two Shiite Moslem air
pirates beat him so savagely he was in shock, said Rosemarie Anne
Henderson, a passenger aboard Flight 847.
   ``The young man (Stethem) was crying. He was unable to walk by
himself,'' said Mrs. Henderson, an Australian who was traveling
with her husband and daughter.
   She said Mohammed Ali Hamadi led Stethem down the airplane's
aisle, told her husband to get out of his seat and put Stethem next
to her.
   Hamadi is on trial on charges of murder and air piracy in the
June 1985 hijacking of the Athens-to-Rome flight in which Stethem
was killed and 39 Americans were held captive for 17 days.
   Mrs. Henderson, 52, said she later switched seats with her
daughter and that her daughter talked to Stethem at length.
   ``He said to her that if anyone would have to be killed, he
hoped it would be him, because the others (the five fellow divers)
were all married,'' Mrs. Henderson said, her voice breaking with
emotion.
   ``He was in shock. He also had a bandage around his neck. It had
blood on it,'' Mrs. Henderson said.
   ``He said he thought his knee was broken. He told her he had
been tied up and that when they finished beating him he was hit
over the head with the pistol.''
   ``He was shaking,'' Mrs. Henderson said. ``He said some of his
ribs were broken.''
   Motioning with her hands, Mrs. Henderson said Stethem kept
rubbing an injured hand.
   ``He said he had no feeling (in it),'' Mrs. Henderson said.
   After the plane landed in Beirut, Stethem, 23, of Waldorf, Md.,
was shot and pushed out of the plane. He died on the airport tarmac.
   In testimony Tuesday, an American held during the hijacking
testified that Hamadi appeared proud of Stethem's slaying.
   ``He looked like the fox that got the chicken. He showed
absolutely no remorse,'' said Stuart Dahl, a 34-year-old U.S. Navy
diver.
   Dahl also said he believed Hamadi was the hijacker who shot
Stethem.
   Shaking his finger and pointing directly at Hamadi, he said: ``I
know he was the one that hit me on the back of the head. Although I
did not see him ... I would say he was the one who did it (shot
Stethem).''
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage. His trial
began July 5 and is expected to last until December.
   Dahl, Stethem's Navy supervisor, said that ``immediately, not
more than a minute after the shooting,'' Hamadi came to where he
was sitting in the airplane and hit him on the back of the head
with the butt of the gun.
   ``He was very proud of his power; he was very proud of what he
had done,'' said Dahl.
   Witnesses have given conflicting testimony about who fired the
shot that killed Stethem.
   Dahl's testimony echoed that of pilot John Testrake, who said he
believed Hamadi was the gunman. Other witnesses said they thought
another hijacker shot him.
   Hamadi has admitted being one of the hijackers but has denied
killing Stethem.
   A third diver, 30-year-old Tony Daniel Watson, testified Tuesday
that Hamadi shoved a cocked pistol at his face and seemed ready to
shoot before a flight attendant begged him to stop.
   ``He had a chrome-plated automatic pistol in his hand. He
pointed it directly in my face and pulled back the hammer.''
   ``I was very afraid I would be shot,'' Watson said.

<HEAD>Man Faces Trial in February Takeover of Tuscaloosa School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who faces 110 counts of kidnapping
in the 12-hour takeover of a private school last February was
granted the right to defend himself after promising the judge he
wouldn't disrupt his trial.
   James L. Harvey made the promise to Circuit Judge John M. Karrh
at a pre-trial hearing Monday. Jury selection was to begin this
afternoon.
   Karrh, in granting Harvey's request to represent himself, warned
that the defendant would be taken from the courtroom if he shows
any ``disruptive or obstreperous behavior.''
   The judge also told Harvey he would not allow any statements not
related to the kidnapping charges.
   ``You won't have any problem out of me, I promise you that,''
said Harvey, 43, of Tuscaloosa.
   Harvey is accused in connection with the Feb. 2 takeover of West
End Christian School in Tuscaloosa. Armed with two pistols and a
rifle and wearing ski masks, Harvey and another man entered the
school and held 110 students and teachers hostage, saying he was
trying to draw attention to the nation's homeless and hungry.
   No one was injured in the incident, which ended 12 hours later
with Harvey's surrender on viewing a bogus pardon videotaped by
Gov. Guy Hunt. Charges were later dropped against the other man,
who police said was forced to participate in the takeover.
   The governor is one of 137 witnesses Harvey has subpoenaed.
Hunt's assistant press secretary, Stacy Rimer, said he would
testify.
   Harvey has been held in lieu of $8.4 million bond since Feb. 2.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to more than 10,000 years in
prison.
   ``I would never do anything to hurt anybody,'' Harvey told the
Tuscaloosa News in a telephone call from the county jail Monday.
``It is not inside of me.''
   He said any of his student hostages could have left ``any time
they wanted to walk out.''
   ``All I wanted to do,'' Harvey said, ``was help the many
oppressed people in pain and suffering in bondage and the many
starving people in my country. I do again beg forgiveness from
these children, teachers, parents and every citizen.''
   Because of publicity in Tuscaloosa, Karrh moved the trial to
Huntsville, about 160 miles away.

   Police have ruled out robbery in an
attack on a wealthy financier and the daughter of the late John
Wayne, but say the motive remains unclear.
   ``These are notable people we're dealing with. We don't know
whether the attack relates to their business or personal lives.
There's a lot of different possibilities here,'' said police
spokesman Greg Armstrong.
   Aissa Wayne, 32, and mortgage financier Roger Luby, 52, were
attacked by two men Monday as the couple, who have been dating for
several months, returned to Luby's multimillion-dollar mansion
after jogging.
   ``They grabbed her hair and beat her face against the
concrete,'' said Ms. Wayne's mother, Pilar, widow of the late
actor. ``Her wrists are getting black and blue and she breaks out
crying every 10 minutes.''
   Nothing was stolen, and the attack lasted less than two minutes,
said Detective Sgt. Mike Jackson.
   ``Obviously, somebody hired these guys,'' Jackson said. ``They
went in, did their thing and got out.''
   Among the leads police are checking is a failed real estate
deal, involving a downtown Los Angeles building, that forced Luby
and his estranged wife, Sandra, into bankruptcy.
   Luby, a former American Express executive, told police the
attackers asked him if he was Roger Luby, Armstrong said. Then,
they pistol-whipped the two and cut Luby's ankle, knicking his
Achilles tendon.
   ``The way the attack went down, it looks like she (Wayne) was in
the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Jackson said. ``It was meant
as a message to him.''
   Ms. Wayne said Tuesday that one of the attackers said: ``You're
messing with the wrong guy. Next time, we'll kill you.''
   Luby and Ms. Wayne, whose hands and feet were bound behind them,
were found by Luby's houseboy, who freed them and called police.
They were treated at Hoag Memorial Hospital and released.

<HEAD>Reagan Authorized Free Hand for CIA on Counterterrorism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed intelligence
authorizations in 1984 and 1985 giving CIA agents broad
anti-terrorism powers that some administration officials saw as ``a
license to kill,'' according to a published report.
   The authorizations ``deemed'' as lawful any covert actions _
including potentially violent ones _ taken in ``good faith'' by
U.S. intelligence agents against terrorists, according to a report
in today's editions of The Washington Post.
   The language of the findings seemingly was ambiguous, the Post
said. Actions taken in good faith and as part of an approved
operation would be deemed lawful in advance, but also they ``must
be'' lawful, sources told the Post.
   The newspaper quoted a former White House official, whom it did
not identify, as saying the Reagan orders were a ``go-anywhere,
do-anything'' authority.
   The language of the findings caused disputes among
administration officials, the Post said, because actions that could
be authorized under the findings might conflict with earlier
presidential executive orders banning any direct or indirect
involvement of U.S. intelligence agents in assassinations.
   The Post quoted a source as saying the language was specifically
designed to ``circumvent the assassination ban'' and protect CIA
agents who might take part in foreign strike teams.
   White House spokesman Bob Hall told The Associated Press he knew
nothing about the findings late Tuesday night.
   The Post reported that unidentified White House officials said
Vice President George Bush would have been given a copy of or would
have had access to the findings.
   A Bush spokesman and Bush campaign chairman James Baker III, who
was White House chief of staff at the time Reagan signed the 1984
finding, had no comment, the Post said.
   Reagan signed the first finding on Nov. 13, 1984, shortly after
his landslide reelection victory, the report said, because U.S.
officials had become frustrated with car-bombings at U.S.
facilities and the taking of American hostages.
   Congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the
crucial language in the findings, the report said.
   The authorization was rescinded on April 10, 1985, a month after
a car bomb exploded, killing 80 people in Beirut near the residence
of a leader of one faction of Iranian fundamentalists.
   The second authorization which included similar language was
signed by Reagan on Aug. 11, 1985, two months after the highjacking
of TWA Flight 847 in which American Navy diver Robert Stethem was
killed. The intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of
the second finding, the Post said.

   U.S-Vietnamese teams investigating the
fates of American airmen shot down on bombing missions found two
sets of human remains and the possible site of other remains,
officials said today.
   ``We found partial human remains at two different locations,''
said Bill Bell, leader of the six U.S. military experts. ``Neither
U.S. nor Vietnamese forensic experts have had access to them at
this point. The Vietnamese have pledged to immediately repatriate
any remains so we expect to receive them in the near future.''
   The two teams of experts found the remains and pieces of
aircraft wreckage in an eight-day search of areas in five provinces
around Hanoi. In the search, which ended Tuesday, the investigators
interviewed villagers and inspected sites were planes crashed
during the Vietnam War.
   The teams focused on trying to determine what happened to six
airmen shot down during bombing missions from 1965 to 1967, said
Nguyen Can, head of Vietnam's Office For Seeking Missing Personnel.
U.S. officials said some of the six men were believed to have
survived, although there was no evidence they are still alive.
   Villagers led investigators to remains in Lang Son and Ha Nam
Ninh provinces, said Can. He said the chances of identifying the
remains was improved because teeth were found.
   The remains will be sent to the United States after Vietnamese
experts examine them.
   U.S. investigators said the remains at Lang Son were found in a
graveyard, but they doubted the body was that of an American. They
also reported visiting sites in Ha Nam Ninh and Ha Bac provinces
that villagers said contained remains of Americans.
   The Americans left Hanoi today for Bangkok, Thailand, but were
to return Friday to review their findings and possibly discuss
additional joint work including excavations of the crash sites.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said Tuesday his
government agreed in principle to many more joint investigations
over the next two months to resolve the 70 ``discrepancy cases'' _
including the six airmen _ that the United States considers top
priority. Washington says there is evidence Vietnamese authorities
should have information on these cases, which include airmen who
were captured but never returned after U.S. forces withdrew from
Vietnam in 1973.
   The United States for years urged joint investigations, but
Vietnam previously allowed only one previous joint field project,
the 1985 excavation of a crash site outside Hanoi.
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
from the Indochina war in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three
Indochinese governments deny holding any live Americans.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers protesting
government failure to deal with a severe economic crisis marched on
the Parliament today demanding the ouster of Yugoslavia's communist
leaders, it was reported.
   About 5,000 workers from a factory in the Belgrade suburb of
Rakovica crowded in front of the Parliament, demanding to speak to
Serbian Communist Party leader Slobodan Milosevic, the official
Tanjug news agency reported.
   About 2,000 of the workers entered the building, protesting that
they had been locked inside their factory and prevented from
joining fellow workers in a protest march on Parliament on Tuesday.
   ``We have been betrayed!'' and ``We were locked up!'' they
chanted as they rushed in.
   Milosevic, who is hailed by supporters as the political heir to
the late Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, told them:
   ``You should have trust that we shall carry out our reforms. The
moment you lose the trust, you should replace us.''
   The Rakovica workers _ who earn about $100 a month, or
two-thirds of the national average _ are part of the growing
national unrest in the face of a government austerity program
introduced in May that resulted in huge price rises and wage cuts.
   Today's protest ended peacefully, with the workers leaving after
speaking to Milosevic, said witnesses, who requested anonymity.
   On Tuesday, a cordon of policemen held back another angry crowd
of 5,000 workers from the Parliament building as they chanted
demands for Premier Branko Mikulic and his government to resign.
The workers jeered at Deputy Premier Milos Milosavljevic and
Parliament president Dusan Popovski, who has said he may resign.
   Yugoslavia is facing increasing labor and social unrest in the
worst economic crisis in its postwar history. The foreign debt is
$21 billion, unemployment is at least 15 percent and the official
inflation rate has reached 217 percent. However, it is widely
believed the inflation rate is actually higher.
   Two top Communist Party leaders resigned last week from the
23-member ruling Presidium in reaction to mass rallies organized by
Milosevic supporters in Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six
republics.
   Communist Party leader Stipe Suvar announced Tuesday that up to
one-third of the Central Committee may be replaced at a key meeting
Oct. 17, where a major shakedown is expected over the party's
failure to manage the economic, ethnic and political tensions in
Yugoslavia.
   Party leaders also have been blamed for failing to stop tensions
in the autonomous region of Kosovo between ethnic Albanians, who
are Moslems, and the Christian Slavs.

   College students tested the stage and power
saws whined in the background as workers transformed a sports arena
into a giant television studio for tonight's debate between Lloyd
Bentsen and Dan Quayle.
   Organizers proclaimed the hall ready for business, awaiting only
minor adjustments after the two vice presidential candidates make
personal visits today.
   ``Everything is coming together beautifully here,'' said Janet
Brown, executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on
Presidential Debates. ``We're a little ahead of schedule on the
tasks that have to be performed.''
   The 10,000-seat Omaha Civic Auditorium underwent a radical
facelift in the days following a professional wrestling match on
Sunday, sprouting network anchor booths, hundreds of yards of
patriotic bunting and miles of electrical cable snaking throughout.
The auditorium has been reconfigured to seat 2,000 _ of which only
100 seats are available to the public.
   It even sported a red-carpeted ``spin valley'' where Democrats
and Republicans were to be herded after the debate to present their
side of the debate to reporters.
   ``We're attempting to turn a sports arena into a theater. We're
also creating what is in effect a television studio,'' said Ed
Fouhy, producer of the event. ``We think we've got this hall turned
into what we want, and that is a debate hall.''
   As workers completed their tasks, organizers brought in college
students to play the role of debaters and panelists so technicians
could perfect their camera angles.
   Some final details awaited the visits of the two candidates.
Each has an hour to tour the hall and test such items as the
lecterns, which were set at 48 inches high for both.
   An agreement between the two campaigns allows the lecterns to be
lowered up to three inches so the two candidates would appear the
same height on television. With Bentsen standing a couple of inches
over six feet and Quayle close at roughly six feet, little
adjustment is likely, Fouhy said.
   Many officials downplayed the arena's transformation, saying the
vice presidential debate was just one more show.
   ``We do this every day of the year,'' said Terry Forsberg,
building manager. ``It's not even as massive as some of the
concerts we do. We're used to it.''
   The centerpiece _ the stage setting _ will be a familiar one to
millions of American television viewers. It's the same stage that
was used for last month's debate between presidential contenders
Michael Dukakis and George Bush in Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Workers turned the auditorium into a patriotic showcase, with
400 feet of blue carpet and 100 feet of red and white rope and _
for the human touch _ plants described as ``living green.''
   The preparations were halted temporarily Tuesday afternoon when
a transformer failure darkened half the building and cut power to a
fleet of television trucks parked outside. It was repaired quickly.
   Officials wired in about 500 telephone lines, and had to go
searching for extra electricity for the legion of television
satellite trucks already dotting the streets outside the auditorium.
   ``When you add the television city outside, we had to bring in
extra power,'' Forsberg said.
   But after the effort, officials were confident their handiwork
was ready.
   ``We've made it,'' Forsberg said. ``We made it with plenty of
time to spare.''
   ``We made it, actually, about two hours early,'' Fouhy said.
   Meanwhile, Omaha city officials were putting their best feet
forward, clearing parking garages around the auditorium for
reporters and debate organizers and starting up a bus shuttle from
the airport to downtown.
   Their zealousness drew fire from advocates for the homeless, who
charged they were clearing the homeless out of downtown to avoid
embarrassment. City officials rejected the charges.

<HEAD>Mental Health Commissioner Orders Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state's mental health commissioner has
ordered an inquiry into his department's handling of the case of
James William Wilson, the man accused in the Greenwood school
shooting spree last week that killed two children.
   Joseph Bevilacqua said Tuesday he could not yet assess whether
the mental health department made errors in not committing Wilson,
19, for treatment before his deadly visit to Oakland Elementary
School on Sept. 26.
   Two children died, and nine people, including two teachers, were
wounded.
   ``I, of course, have concerns where you have a situation of the
magnitude of this case in regard to the disruption of the community
and the lives that have been involved,'' Bevilacqua said.
   He said a panel of outside experts and people from within the
department will review Wilson's files and interview people involved
in the case.
   ``We're not blaming anyone,'' Bevilacqua said. ``We're trying to
get an assessment of what happened in a very difficult situation.
And if we should make corrective actions, we will, in fact, make
the corrective action.''
   The department twice since 1986 had rejected attempts by
Wilson's relatives to have him involuntary committed to a state
facility, according to a retired probate judge who had been
involved in the attempts.
   The former judge, Rosemary M. Trakas, told The Greenville News
that Wilson's family twice filed affidavits seeking his commitment
since 1986. She said he was evaluated on both occasions by the
department's Beckman Mental Health Center in Greenwood, and that
the petitions were rejected.
   She said Wilson had been involuntarily committed to the State
Hospital in Columbia for a period ``of just a few months'' in 1983.
He is back in that hospital now, undergoing a psyciatric
examination ordered by a court after the shootings.
   Dr. Willie Moseley of Greenwood, a private psychiatrist who had
treated Wilson, said Wilson checked himself into the mental health
unit at Self Memorial Hospital in Greenwood for 15 days about six
months ago.
   He said after that Wilson, described by his family as
hyperactive, reclusive and fascinated with multiple killers, was
referred to the Beckman center, but that he never went there for
treatment.
   Wilson's father, James T. Wilson Jr., said his son was no longer
covered by the family insurance policy when he turned 19 in April
and that private psychiatric care was too expensive.

   NASA crews today prepared
Discovery for its piggyback ride atop a jet to Florida and repaired
minor damage suffered in the space shuttle's 65 orbits of Earth.
   ``The crews are working, and they will work round the clock
until the orbiter leaves'' Saturday, said Ted Ayers, deputy site
manager for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Dryden Flight Research Facility here.
   The spacecraft, which landed here Monday, had six heat-shield
tiles gouged by debris, apparently during liftoff, said John
Talone, shuttle processing director.
   Workers also found some ``dings'' to a few of the hundreds of
tiles that coat the shuttle, but detected no damage to the
orbiter's brakes, landing gear or tires, Talone said.
   Discovery sat inside the 100-foot-tall ``mate-demate device,'' a
shuttle garage where it is being serviced before its trip aboard a
jet Saturday to its Florida launch site.
   Workers must deactivate fuel cells, photograph tile damage and
replace gouged tiles, purge main engines and orbital maneuvering
engines, and attach locks to prevent control flaps from fluttering
during the piggyback flight.
   Discovery's mission was America's first manned space mission
since the Challenger tragedy in January 1986 that killed seven crew
members.
   ``The vehicle looks beautiful,'' Talone said during a news
conference Tuesday. ``It looks probably as good or better as any
vehicle we've brought in here.''
   Six tiles near the right wing must be replaced because of a
12-inch-long, 6-inch-wide, 1{-inch-deep gouge apparently caused by
debris during the shuttle's launch Thursday, Talone said.
   Talone said officials weren't yet sure if the debris was ice
that formed on the outside of the shuttle's external tank, which
contains supercold fuel.
   ``There's a minor number of traditional dings'' on some other
tiles, caused by the impact of tiny particles during liftoff and
landing, he added.
   After preliminary inspection found no damage, the shuttle's
brakes were shipped to B.F. Goodrich in Ohio for a closer look, he
said. The brakes were improved because of brake and tire damage
during previous missions.
   Talone said NASA workers haven't identified the cause of the
trouble with Discovery's flash evaporators _ a problem that made
the astronauts endure temperatures in the 80s during their flight.
   NASA plans for Discovery to depart Edwards early Saturday,
arriving at Kennedy Space Center in Florida before dark following a
single stop near San Antonio, Texas, Talone said.
   Discovery's next mission is scheduled to start Feb. 18, three
months after Atlantis' planned Nov. 17 liftoff with a classified
Defense Department payload.

<TEXT>
   A small group of top officials today
attended a low-key military parade, the first since President Anwar
Sadat was assassinated, to mark the 15th anniversary of the 1973
Middle East War.
   Sadat was killed at a much more elaborate anniversary parade on
Oct. 6, 1981.
   President Hosni Mubarak, government ministers and a select group
of diplomats were the only spectators allowed inside the high walls
of the Military College for today's two-hour parade, broadcast live
on television and radio.
   The government did not say why it held the parade a day earlier
than the anniversary of the war's start. Egypt considers its
crossing of the Suez Canal on Oct. 6, 1973, and capture of Israeli
positions on the western side as its finest modern-day military
accomplishment.
   The government also did not say why it resumed the military
parade, an annual tradition under Sadat. It was suspended after
Moslem extremists killed the president and seven other people.
   Under Sadat, the parades were held on one of Cairo's largest
streets. The day he died, he wore a white, high-booted uniform with
gold braid. Mubarak, commander of the air force before Sadat chose
him as vice president, stood beside him in uniform.
   Mubarak has not worn his uniform in public since that day.
Today, he wore a dark blue suit and mirrored sunglasses.
   In Sadat's parades, hundreds of gleaming tanks and armored
personnel carriers filled the streets and jet fighter-bombers gave
spectacular aerial shows.
   Today, trailers carrying tanks passed the elevated presidential
box one at a time. A handful of helicopters with Egypt's flag
dangling from them flew overhead for a while, and 15 parachutists
landed on the wide parade grounds. The parade was mainly a show of
the weapons that Egypt and Syria used in the 1973 war, called the
Yom Kippur War in Israel and the 10th of Ramadan War in the Arab
world.
   In a brief videotaped address, Mubarak said Sadat was a brave
hero who decided to make war and won, then decided to make peace.
   Sadat and former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, spurred
by President Carter, signed the Camp David accord in 1979. It is
still the only peace agreement between an Arab country and the
Jewish state.

   The Central Elections Committee today branded
Rabbi Meir Kahane's anti-Arab Kach party racist and anti-democratic
and barred it from competing in the Nov. 1 election.
   ``It was a political lynching,'' Kach candidate Rahamim Cohen
said. Kahane vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The committee's head, Eliezer Goldberg, said: ``The request for
the barring of Kach has been accepted. It is still subject to
judicial review.''
   In 1984, the Supreme Court overturned a similar committee
decision that would have barred Kach from competing in
parliamentary elections that year. Since then, Parliament has
passed a bill banning racism from political activity.
   ``In 1984, we didn't have an anti-racist law. Today we have, and
I hope (Kahane's) appeal to the high court will not be
successful,'' said Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev.
   Bar-Lev, a leading member of the left-of-center Labor Party,
told reporters his party supported the ban even though Labor would
gain if Kach drew votes from the right-wing Likud bloc.
   The disqualification, which was expected, passed 28-5 with three
abstentions. The motion was brought by seven parties, including
Likud and Labor.
   Cohen rejected the charge that the party is racist and called
the Arabs ``a hostile population.''
   ``That is the source of our attitude towards them, not the fact
that they are part of another nation or are another color or
practice another religion,'' Cohen said.
   Kach spokesman Baruch Marzel said the party is confident the
Supreme Court will overturn the decision. ``With the help of God
they will reinstate our list,'' he said.
   Kahane, who was born in New York City and founded the Jewish
Defense League in the United States, founded Kach, which means
``Thus'' in Hebrew. It calls for the ouster of Arabs from all
Israeli-held territory and opposes Jewish-Arab marriages.
   Arguing for Kach's disqualification, left-wing legislators
compared Kahane's anti-Arab platform to the Nazis' anti-Semitic
policies during World War II.
   ``When the Jewish people become the dominant majority does it
also mean they treat (minorities) as those other nations did that
lost all shades of humanity?'' said Haim Ramon of Labor.
   Meanwhile, Labor and Likud traded new allegations over an
alleged wiretapping scandal dubbed the ``Israeli Watergate.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of Likud, was quoted today
in the daily Yediot Ahronot as saying Labor's alleged bugging of
Likud campaign headquarters was a ``shameful phenomenon.''
   Shamir also was quoted as telling a closed forum of supporters
that his party must ``shake the world and do anything to stop them
(Labor)'' from winning the election.
   ``When I consider the possiblity that the Likud may not win, it
drives me mad,'' the Maariv daily quoted him as saying. ``They
(Labor members) are capable of anything, they must be stopped.''
   Likud has asked Attorney General Yosef Harish to investigate
Labor on suspicion it bugged Likud facilities and the home phone of
campaign chairman Moshe Arens. Harish is considering the request.
   Asked about evidence of bugging, Likud spokesman Danny Naveh
would say only that Arens heard crackling in his line, and his wife
spotted prowlers in her yard last week
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, head of Labor, belittled the
charges. ``This is puppet theater, and I don't see any real person
there on stage,'' Peres said Tuesday during a campaign swing
through industrial towns in northern Israel.
   Likud and Labor both claimed victory today in the first major
test of the campaign _ the launching of crucial television ads
Tuesday night.
   Likud presented slick spots with an upbeat jingle, flag-waving
children and a statesmanlike Shamir calling for a fair campaign.
Labor and its policies were rarely mentioned.
   Labor took a more aggressive stand, repeatedly contrasting its
positions to that of Likud. A stern announcer hinted that Likud's
policies would lead to war.
   Both parties referred only briefly to the 10-month Palestinian
uprising in the occupied territories, although both have billed
Middle East peace as the crucial campaign issue.
   Shamir promised that once Likud is in government, it will
``immediately propose peace talks'' with Israel's Arab enemies.
Peres urged voters to ``give me the mandate to bring an end to war
and ensure peace for our country.''

<TEXT>
   A woman who was hospitalized after she
took an overdose of pills during a break in a foreclosure hearing
on her family's farm also was troubled by death and illness in her
family, authorities said.
   Westmoreland Hospital in Greensburg declined to release a
condition report on Ida Depta, 48, of Alverton, but the family's
attorney said she was in stable condition.
   Mrs. Depta was admitted Tuesday after swallowing unidentified
pills from two prescription bottles in a courthouse hallway while
foreclosure negotiations broke for lunch, said paramedic Harley
Gray. The proceedings were then postponed.
   ``She stated to us that all she wants to do is to join her mom
at the cemetery,'' said Deputy Sheriff Eric Sinclair. ``She's just
upset over her mom, her brother is dying of cancer and the possible
loss of the farm.''
   Witnesses said Mrs. Depta's 18-year-old daughter, Julie, was
able to remove some of the pills from her mother's mouth.
   The foreclosure, filed in 1985 by ITT Financial Services of
Greensburg, involves a $111,251 debt by Mrs. Depta and her husband,
Joseph Depta Jr., on a family dairy farm in Westmoreland County.
   The fact that she took the pills in front of other people
``tells me she wasn't so much trying to kill herself as she was
asking for help,'' Ned Nakles Jr., the family's attorney, said
today.
   According to Nakles and court documents, the foreclosure hearing
was the latest in a series of woes for the family. Mrs. Depta's
mother died on Aug. 24.
   Depta was injured in a 1984 traffic accident and has since been
unable to work, which cut into the farm's income. The family also
lost 18 cows when a cow bought from a supplier had a contagious
disease that spread through the herd. The Deptas have taken legal
action against the supplier.

<TEXT>
   Four Soviet observers flew over the English
countryside today armed with tape recorders and cameras to inspect
military maneuvers on British territory for the first time.
   The Soviets are visiting Britain under terms of the 1986
Stockholm Agreement on East-West confidence building measures.
Under the accord, all 35 participating nations must be notified of
each other's large-scale maneuvers.
   The colonels, Anatoli Makhov, Vladimir Greshnikov, Yuri Leonov
and Vladimir Trofimov, landed at London's Heathrow Airport early
this morning and were taken by helicopter to the British army's
Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, 80 miles west of London.
   The Defense Ministry said the exercise, which is codenamed
Drake's Drum, began Saturday and ends Sunday. It extends over 5,500
square miles of southern England and includes several south coast

as airfields and ports, the ministry said.
   After a briefing by Col. John Cooper, chief of staff of the

inspection.
   The ministry said the Soviets will observe the exercise for two
days.

<HEAD>Eastern Earthquake Said Nearly Certain To Strike Within 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans living east of the Rocky Mountains
have a major earthquake in their future _ probably in the next two
decades _ a panel of experts is warning.
   ``Terra firma is an illusion,'' Russell Christesen, chairman of
the board of Ebasco Services Inc., said Tuesday at a symposium
called to discuss earthquake hazards and the federal response. He
said any portion of the nation can be affected by quakes.
   ``The major problem is lack of awareness that there is a
problem,'' added Robert L. Ketter, director of the National Center
for Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New
York at Buffalo.
   ``The public is not concerned because people have not felt a
quake in their lifetime. This (meeting) is an effort to shake up
that complacency,'' Ketter said.
   Ketter warned that a major earthquake is nearly certain to
strike the eastern two-thirds of the nation in the next 20 years,
threatening havoc in a region unprepared for such a disaster.
   While he could not pin down a specific location for the temblor,
he said likely sites include the areas of Memphis, Tenn.,
Charleston, S.C., Boston, and New York City. He also included a
western area on the list: Salt Lake City, Utah.
   The probability of a destructive quake occurring at any
particular spot is low, Ketter said.
   ``However, the probability of one occurring somewhere in the
eastern United States before the year 2000 can be considered better
than 75 percent to 95 percent. Before the year 2010, nearly 100
percent.''
   Unlike Californians, residents of the states east of the Rocky
Mountains have paid little attention to the danger of quakes.
   There are no building codes calling for quake resistant
buildings in the East, Ketter said, and little public notice of the
danger.
   And yet the strongest earthquakes ever to strike the United
States occurred in the Memphis, Tenn.-New Madrid, Mo., region in
1811-1812, Ketter noted. In addition, a disastrous quake shook
Charleston, S.C., in 1886, and other strong quakes have been felt
in the Boston area and along the U.S.-Canadian border.
   A tremor shook Jamaica Bay in New York in the 1800s, he said,
that, if repeated today, would cause as much as $7 billion in
damage in the Brooklyn area.
   While California _ in particular along the famous San Andreas
fault _ has been the subject of great attention, quakes in the East
are less well understood.
   But when they do occur, the rigid rock underlying the states
east of the Rocky Mountains carries the shock to much greater
distances than California temblors.
   The 1811-1812 quakes in the Missouri-Tennessee border region
caused church bells to ring as far away as Boston, 1,000 miles
distant, Ketter said.
   Those quakes are little remembered because the region was only
sparsely populated at the time. If they were repeated today the
result would be havoc, Ketter and others reported.
   Ketter and Robert Chartrand, of the Congressional Research
Service at the Library of Congress, presented a scenario for a new
Memphis-area quake.
   A tremor equivalent to one of the three major shocks of the past
could be expected to kill as many as 200 people, injure 8,000 and
leave an estimated 250,000 homeless in the Memphis vicinity,
Chartrand estimated.
   And Ketter said the potential death toll could range from nearly
700 to almost 5,000 in the six cities nearest the center of the
quake: Memphis; Paducah, Ky.; Carbondale, Ill.; Evansville, Ind.;
Poplar Bluff, Mo.; and Little Rock, Ark.
   Near the epicenter most homes and buildings could collapse;
dams, dikes and embankments would fail; and there would be
landslides. Farther away, masonry houses could collapse, frame
houses shift on their foundations, trees topple and cracks appear
in slopes, Ketter said.
   Chartrand's study forsees a bridge collapse over the Mississippi
River; widespread flooding in the Memphis area; failure of gas,
electric, water and sewer systems; disruption of oil and natural
gas pipelines passing through the region; hospitals damaged and
overwhelmed with patients; transportation disrupted; and other
major problems.

   Crew members trying to pump sea water from a ship's
cargo hold inadvertently flooded the compartment with carbon
monoxide fumes, killing two men and injuring 14 others, including
rescue workers, officials said.
   Rescue workers became endangered Tuesday because they had to
take off their oxygen equipment to squeeze into the hold,
accessible only through a two-foot opening, fire-rescue Capt. Jim
Tolbert said.
   The fumes were generated by a gasoline-powered pump that had
long been used to empty sea water from the cargo hold aboard the
Panamanian-registered Turrialda, city fire spokeswoman Nivia Boaz
said.
   Crew members Stacey Taibel, 55, and Fajaido Alamacio, 30, were
pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at Jackson, Ms. Baderman said.
   One crew member remained in serious condition at Jackson and
three others were in stable condition at Mercy Hospital in Miami. A
fifth crew member, a firefighter and two police officers were in
fair condition today. Six other firefighters were treated and
released after being overcome by fumes.
   A treatment being used for those overcome involved placing them
in hyperbaric chambers, similar to those used to decompress divers,
authorities said.

<HEAD>Former Teacher Indicted In Shooting Of Turkish Premier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Turkish court has indicted a former
teacher in the attempted assassination of Premier Turgut Ozal four
months ago, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
   Kartal Demirag was indicted Tuesday by the State Security Court,
which charged him with attempted premeditated murder for shooting
at Ozal while the premier was delivering a speech to members of his
governing Motherland Party.
   The indictment, which said Demirag held neo-fascist views, also
charged him with carrying an unlicensed weapon and using a false
identity, according to the news agency.
   One of the two shots Demirag fired hit the microphone in front
of the premier and the other struck Ozal's thumb. Bodyguards
returned fire, wounding 20 other people and the gunman.
   Demirag was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison for
knifing a man in a coffeehouse brawl. He escaped from jail in
January and remained in hiding until the assassination attempt.
   No trial date has been set.
   Turkish newspapers reported earlier that Demirag was a member of
the youth organization of the defunct neo-fascist National Movement
Party.
   The party's youth branch, known as the Gray Wolves, participated
in terrorism that claimed about 5,000 lives from 1978 to 1980 and
that led to a military takeover in 1980.
   The indictment said Demirag had a grudge against Ozal for not
declaring an amnesty for right-wing activists after he was elected
premier, Anatolia said.
   Mehmet Ali Agca, the Turkish gunman who shot and wounded Pope
John Paul II in Rome in 1981, also allegedly belong to the Gray
Wolves.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of troops guarded polling
places today and voters stood in mile-long lines to cast ``yes'' or
``no'' ballots on a proposal to extend President Augusto Pinochet's
15-year rule to 1997.
   Power outages blamed on terrorist bombings plunged the capital
and other cities into darkness late Tuesday, but the country was
calm as polls opened at 8 a.m.
   By midmorning, thousands of voters lined up at Santiago voting
centers, waiting patiently under a sunny, cloudless sky in warm
spring weather.
   Chile's 7.4 million registered voters are required by law to
vote. Some voters said they arrived early for fear of trouble later
in the day.
   Pinochet, who voted downtown late this morning, spoke
sarcastically of the blackout by using the slogan of the
opposition: ``It's the joy that's coming.'' But the 72-year-old
army commander told reporters he heard no reports of incidents in
the first hours of voting. ``There are no problems,'' he said.
``The people are voting normally.''
   Pinochet, who campaigned hard across the country for a ``yes''
vote, was asked about the outcome and said, ``I'm always
optimistic.''
   Among early voters was Patricio Aylwin, president o the centrist
Christian Democratic Party and leader of a 16-party coalition
campaigning for Pinochet's defeat.
   ``It's like returning to the times of the republic,'' he
declared after casting his ballot in Chile's first presidential
vote since 1970.
   The downtown was virtually deserted, with shops and offices
closed for election day, a national holiday.
   Radio reports also indicated a heavy turnout without serious
problems in provincial cities and towns.
   If a majority votes ``yes,'' Pinochet will assume a new
eight-year term in March. If most vote ``no,'' an open election
with two or more candidates will take place next year, and the
winner will assume the presidency in March 1990.
   At least eight explosions were heard in Santiago on Tuesday
night, moments after the power outage affected a 1,300-mile stretch
of the country.
   Police said terrorists bombed at least three electrical towers,
but said they had no reports of damage or injuries from the
subsequent explosions, indicating they may have been noise bombs
intended to frighten but not harm.
   The nation's long-idled election machinery was put back in place
for the referendum on Pinochet, who lifted emergency rule and
loosened his tight grip on the opposition in the months preceding
the balloting.
   The first unofficial returns are to be released about an hour
after polls close at 5 a.m.
   The opposition coalition, distrustful of the Interior Ministry's
tabulations, planned a separate vote count. The group says it will
accept as official the results of the National Electoral Service,
which are to be disclosed on Friday.
   Gen. Jorge Zincke, military commander of Santiago, said
officials were ordered to provide access at polling places to an
estimated 500 foreign observers. ``We have nothing to hide,'' he
said.
   About 150,000 members of the armed forces and national police
have been on barracks alert since Sunday.
   If Pinochet's new eight-year term is approved, the military
junta he leads, which theoretically served as the legislative
branch of his government, will be disbanded. A new Congress would
be seated in 1990, with two-thirds elected and the remaining third
appointed by Pinochet.
   Whatever the outcome of the referendum, congressional elections
will be held in 1990, but the legislature will have limited
authority. It will be virtually powerless to amend a 1980
constitution, which gives the military autonomy and a supervisory
role in national policy-making.
   Pinochet has pointed to an improved economy and the promise of
growth and stability if he is retained as president. His critics
say the rich have benefited the most and that human rights abuses
continue under his rule.
   About 3 million of the 7.4 million voters were too young to vote
in 1973, when Pinochet led a bloody coup that toppled the elected
government of President Salvador Allende, a Marxist. Allende died
in the coup.
   In 1978, Pinochet's military government won a vote of confidence
and in 1980, it won passage the a new constitution.
   But both ballots were loosely organized, with no formal voter
registration and few if any protections against fraud, which
opposition groups say was widespread. This time, the opposition has
expressed satisfaction with the safeguards.

   Attorneys announced in court today the
tentative settlement of a lawsuit filed by Canadians who suffered
emotional trauma from mind-control therapy, including doses of the
drug LSD, given them in the 1950s.
   Lawyers for the government and the nine original plaintiffs did
not specify the amount of the settlement during a brief hearing
before U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn.
   But sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the CIA had
tentatively agreed to pay a lump sum of $750,000 to settle the case.
   Lawyers for both sides sought postponement in the trial of the
eight-year-old case that was to begin Thursday, telling Penn that
the Justice Department will soon review the negotiated settlement.
   Outside the U.S. Courthouse, James Turner, an attorney for the
plaintiffs, praised CIA Director William Webster for playing ``a
very important'' role in the agency's decision to agree to the
settlement.
   ``This is a statement that every part of our government is under
the law, that no part of our government is above the law,'' Turner
said.
   Although the tentative settlement is not an explicit admission
of wrongdoing by the CIA, Turner said, ``I don't tcommitments for several
days now, awaiting Friday's report from the Labor Department on the
employment situation for September.
   Many analysts are projecting that the figures will show strong
job growth, which would presumably revive concerns at the Federal
Reserve and elsewhere about inflation.
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber tumbled 4 to 53\. The company estimated
sharply lower third-quarter earnings from continuing operations.
   Kroger rose 3] to 58| in active trading. The investment firm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. sweetened its buyout bid for the
company.
   Pillsbury, target of a $60-a-share takeover bid by Grand
Metropolitan PLC, led the active list and gained 1 to 58.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.13 to 153.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .64 at 298.98.

   The divorce-fixing trial of former Miss America
Bess Myerson, her lover and a judge is ``about money and greed and
the abuse of power,'' a federal prosecutor said.
   But defense lawyers countered in opening statements Tuesday that
the case was unjustified, ``contrived'' and ``ridiculous.''
   Miss Myerson, 64, the city's former cultural affairs
commissioner, is on trial with Carl ``Andy'' Capasso, 43, and
former state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, who presided
over part of Capasso's bitter divorce.
   Alan D. Scheinkman, a matrimonial law expert from St. John's
University, became the first person to testify today.
   He explained the intricate workings of New York's state court
system, in which the Supreme Court, where Mrs. Gable served, is a
low-level court where trials are held. As a prosecutor passed out a
list of legal terms to jurors, Scheinkman also gave the jurors a
quick course in the jargon of divorce court.
   The three defendants face five counts each of conspiracy, mail
fraud and bribe-related charges for an alleged scheme to slash
Capasso's weekly child support and alimony payments.
   Miss Myerson is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job to
Mrs. Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet, who was then 34, shortly after
became cultural affairs commissioner in 1983 to get the judge to
reduce Capasso's temporary support payments to his wife.
   Miss Myerson was named a co-respondent in the Capasso divorce.
   She is also charged with obstructing justice for allegedly
trying to keep Sukhreet Gabel from testifying truthfully before a
federal grand jury.
   ``This is a case about money and greed and the abuse of power,''
Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lawrence told the jury Tuesday. ``It
is about the use of secrets, deceptions and lies to keep the truth
from the public.''
   Miss Myerson, who was Miss America 1945, was forced by the
scandal _ known locally as the ``Bess Mess'' _ to resign her city
post last year.
   Describing her as ``one of the celebrities of New York,''
Lawrence said, ``This case is about whether such privileged people
are above the law.''
   But Capasso's attorney insisted it was the result of a scorned
wife's accusations.
   ``There was no fury as intense and mean-spirited as that of
Nancy Capasso,'' defense lawyer Jay Goldberg said in a loud voice.
   Lawyers for Miss Myerson and Mrs. Gabel attacked the
government's case as purely circumstantial.
   ``It's contrived and ultimately one that is ridiculous,'' said
Myerson attorney Frederick Hafetz.
   Hafetz disputed the government's contention that Miss Myerson
schemed to fix Capasso's divorce because she needed his money. The
attorney said that at the time, she was worth about $10 million.
   Capasso, once a millionaire sewer and water contractor, is
serving a three-year prison term for an unrelated tax conviction.
   Noting Mrs. Gabel's 40 years of public service, her lawyer,
Michael Feldberg, asked if it made sense for her to ``risk
everything she had worked for'' for a job for her daughter.
   He said there were no witnesses to or documents on the alleged
bribery of the judge.
   If convicted of all charges, Miss Myerson would face up to 30
years in prison and $513,000 in fines. Capasso and Mrs. Gabel each
could get up to 25 years and fined $263,000.

   Rep. Jim Bates apologized for what he called
kidding and flirting with the women on his staff, but denied
accusations that his behavior constituted sexual harassment.
   ``I think I've kidded around and flirted around,'' Bates,
D-Calif., said Tuesday. ``I don't know if you could call (them)
advances. I think it was inappropriate. From now on, my behavior is
going to be much more appropriate.''
   Bates, 47, was accused in a weekly newspaper distributed largely
on Capitol Hill in Washington of mistreating his female staff
members by making suggestive comments with sexual overtones and
hugging them.
   The publication, The Roll Call, quoted women on Bates' staff,
whose names were withheld at their request.
   Bates has repeatedly denied specific incidents mentioned in the
story, including an allegation that he wrapped his leg around a
female worker's leg and swayed back and forth while asking about a
legislative project. But he said he regretted any actions that may
have offended those who worked for him or have embarrassed his wife
and family.
   ``In today's workplace, things can be misconstrued, and I think
it's not proper for a public official to be in a position where his
conduct can be even misunderstood,'' Bates said.
   Bates, who is seeking a fourth term in November, faces
challenger Rob Butterfield, considered to be a longshot to upset
him.

statement today. Picks up 9th graf pvs ``Bani-Sadr said...''</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A former president of Iran said an aide to Vice
President George Bush negotiated this week's release of a hostage
held in Lebanon and that Iran received arms _ possibly in a deal to
free the captive.
   A campaign spokeswoman for Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee, termed the remarks by Abolhassan Bani-Sadr ``absolutely
false.''
   Bani-Sadr said Tuesday he did not know if the shipment of
weapons was related to the release Monday of Mithileshwar Singh, a
60-year-old Indian professor and legal U.S. resident.
   ``There has been a delivery of arms to Iran,'' he said. ``Does
that have something to do with the release? I don't know.'' He gave
no details of the purported arms transfer.
   The disclosure of clandestine arms sales to Iran, aimed at
securing the release of the hostages during 1985 and 1986, led to
the Iran-Contra affair. It was the Reagan's administration's worst
foreign policy controversy.
   Bani-Sadr said that according to his information, a man named
Richard Lawless negotiated Singh's release.
   ``It seems he (Lawless) has denied it,'' Bani-Sadr said in
Paris, where he lives in exile. ``I am trying to verify it.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington:
``There is a fellow named Lawless. He is over there. What he's up
to, nobody knows. But he doesn't represent the United States ... He
does not represent the vice president or the president or anybody
else.''
   ``His charges are not true _ from top to bottom,'' Fitzwater
said today. ``Bani-Sadr's full of beans.''
   The presidential spokesman also rejected for the second day in a
row any government connection with Lawless. ``He's not operating
under our instructions,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bani-Sadr said the prior channel for contacts between the United
States and Iran no longer works and a new one has just been
created. He did not elaborate but said a new intermediary had just
left for the United States.
   He would not identify the intermediary either by name or
nationality, saying he did not want to ruin the chances of more
hostage releases.
   Sixteen hostages, including nine Americans, are believed held by
Moslem extremists loyal to Iran.
   Bani-Sadr said Bush has been dealing since last February with
Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament. He said
representatives of both Bush and Democratic presidential nominee
Michael Dukakis have been in Iran for talks.
   Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said in Washington, ``That's not
true. It's preposterous.''
   Bani-Sadr, who fled Iran in 1981, said intense efforts to free
hostages were under way and that he has been told Bush was trying
very hard to work out the release of American hostages in early
October.
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Alixe Glen said in Washington: ``Those
assertions are absolutely false. Absolutely no one is representing
the vice president, the office of the vice president or the
campaign in any dealings with the hostages, or any other dealings
with Iran.''
   The Reagan administration has steadfastly denied that it has
undertaken any talks directly with Iranian officials to get the
hostages released.
   Bani-Sadr said Iran wants the release of Iranian assets frozen
in the United States.
   Iran has filed claims before a joint U.S.-Iranian claims
tribunal for $12 billion in military equipment frozen as a result
of the 1979 Iranian revolution. Tehran also seeks release of
billions of Iranian funds frozen in U.S. banks after seizure of 52
hostages at the U.S. embassy in 1979.
   U.S. officials say $9 billion in financial assets have either
been returned to Iran or paid to its creditors.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on the Soviet leadership shakeup:
   On Friday, it was announced that (Soviet Communist Party
Chairman Mikhail) Gorbachev would succeed retiring Old Guardsman
Andrei Gromyko as president.
   There were other important changes in the leadership, including
the KGB. All were calculated to advance Gorbachev loyalists.
   Perhaps more important, Gorbachev anounced that the Supreme
Soviet, the nation's nominal parliament, would assume a greater
role in everyday management of the country.
   The Soviets (government councils) also were promised more power,
obviously at the expense of the central Communist Party apparatus.
...
   None of this means that the Soviet Union is turning democratic
in the Western definition of that word.
   But it does mean that Gorbachev plans to deal with the Soviet
Union's severe internal divisions with some accommodation and
negotiation.
   The same is almost certainly true of the Soviet Union's foreign
policy.
   That's good news.

   The Rapid City (S.D.) Journal on America's return to space and
Star Wars:
   There were two recent developments in the United States that
bode well for the future of man in space: the successful launch of
a space shuttle, and the official recognition that Star Wars, the
Strategic Defense Initiative, is going to proceed at a much lower
level once President Reagan leaves office. ...
   The space shuttle program was grounded for 32 months after the
Challenger blew apart in early 1986. When the shock of the
explosion eased, the nation discovered it had put too many space
eggs in the shuttle basket. ...
   In addition, the announcement that Air Force Lt. Gen. James A.
Abrahamson, commander of the SDI program for the past five years,
was resigning his post was a milestone in recognizing reality. ...
   For whether Vice President George Bush or Gov. Michael Dukakis
wins the presidency, the Star Wars program is phasing down,
although not out. The only question is, how deeply to cut. ...
   The U.S. is back in space. But, concerning the idea that a quick
technological fix can protect the nation against nuclear war, it is
returning to Earth.

   Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the U.S. space program:
   The flawless landing of the shuttle Discovery ... at Edwards Air
Force Base puts the United States' space program back in business.
   After 2{ years of agonizing reappraisal following the Challenger
explosion, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration showed
the world through the flight of Discovery that it has regained its
directions.
   There is much lost time to be recovered in the space program,
and many decisions to be made.
   But this painful experience has restored NASA's caution without
destroying its will to go on, thereby strengthening it for the
tasks ahead.

   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer on welfare reform:
   Despite rave reviews for the new federal welfare law from
supporters in Congress, the poor should not raise their hopes too
high.
   The lukewarm endorsement of Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., probably
is an accurate appraisal.
   Slattery called the long-awaited legislation ``strictly
marginal.''``It's a coin flip as to whether it will work,'' he
said. ``On a marginal basis, I support this bill. Those who vote
against it may have a better reason than I.'' ...
   During the welfare debate, there was a lot of high-minded
speechifying in Congress about ``raising families out of the mire
of poverty'' and such.
   But political actions, as always, spoke louder than political
talk. Congress will raise $375 million of its new $3.3 billion
welfare bill by taking away from working parents of children 12-14
an income tax deduction for child care.
   And, while telling welfare mothers they must get jobs to support
their families, it refused to raise the minimum wage above $3.35 an
hour.

   Iola (Kan.) Register on the presidential campaign:
   Why did Mike Dukakis put on a helmet, climb into a tank and ride
around in it while the cameras clicked? For the same reason George
Bush toured a flag factory.
   Pollsters told them to. ...
   Hey, are those guys trying to manipulate us? Sure. Blatantly.
   Whenever the winds of public opinion shift, the pollsters detect
the change almost instantly and order a new course. That keeps the
campaigns custom tailored to the ever-shifting national concensus.
   What do the candidates really think about the issues? Who knows.
   But if you want to know what they'll say they think tomorrow
about some piece of campaign business, large or small, just ask
yourself how you feel about it today.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the United Nations' peacekeeping
activities:
   It has been a remarkable year for peace and the United Nations.
We have witnessed considerable progress in the Persian Gulf,
Angola, Cambodia and elsewhere _ in large part because of U.N.
efforts.
   But as U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar reminds
us, ``The recent achievements of the United Nations have neither
been sudden nor fortuitous but are the hard-won results of
persistence and dedication over many years, epitomized by the
peacekeeping activities of the organization.''
   And so it is most fitting that this year's Nobel Peace Prize has
been awarded to U.N. peacekeeping forces. It is, as Perez de
Cuellar so eloquently put it, a tribute to ``idealism, valor and
sacrifice.''
   Recognition is long overdue for the 500,000 troops from 58
countries, including 800 killed in the line of duty, who have
helped keep peace and ease tensions in world hot spots since 1948.
   For 40 years, the world has owed them a debt of gratitude.

   Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on trade restrictions:
   The American consumer won a victory with President Reagan's veto
of a bill that would limit textile and shoe imports.
   Trade restrictions hurt American consumers far more than they
help the protected industries because they invite retaliatory
countermeasures from other countries.
   They allow uncompetitive industries to maintain a sheltered
existence and force consumers to pay more for the products these
industries produce than if the products had to compete with others
from throughout the world.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on steroid use at the
Olympics:
   Evidence of Stanozol (the anabolic steroid detected in a urine
sample submitted by Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter) cost
Johnson his medal and millions of dollars in endorsements. ...
   Athletes, more than any other segment of our society, have been
singled out for their abuse of so-called recreational drugs.
   Wall Street brokers, presidential candidates and newspaper
editors do not undergo the type of scrutiny now expected of
third-string halfbacks in the National Football League.
   This treatment of athletes is unfair.
   But steroids, intended to enhance performance, are a different
story. Rather than abuse his body for a high, an athlete abuses his
body to gain a competitive edge, compromising the sprit of
competition.
   Ben Johnson has become an embarrassment to the nation of Canada
and an object of scorn among ``clean'' athletes. In the end,
however, Johnson is a fortunate man. He was caught, and presumably
will stop this tragic drug abuse.

   Columbia (Mo.) Daily Tribune on gun control:

mattress in his bedroom.
   Apparently Jason got hopped up on heavy metal music and just
decided to act out some of the fantasy that was spinning in his
head. A handgun was handy, so he used it. ...
   When will we wake up and realize the horrible mistake in
allowing people to keep these small, easily concealed handguns? ...
   We ought to ban these small handguns and give police full search
and seizure powers to confiscate them. Seizing handguns would be
infinitely more beneficial to society than seizing marijuana plants.

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on congressional honorariums:
   The decision by two major defense contractors, McDonnell Douglas
and General Dynamics, to suspend temporarily their practice of
paying honorariums to congressmen for speeches is a welcome
reaction to the current investigation of Pentagon fraud. It's not
enough, however.
   Paying members of Congress for speeches is at best a fraud. A
congressman shows up at a function sponsored by a military
contractor ..., makes a brief speech, and pockets upwards of
$2,000. True, the House and Senate have imposed some limits, but
that doesn't make it right.
   Usually the honorariums are paid to congressmen who serve on
committees considering legislation in which the companies or
organizations have an interest. The likelihood of a conflict of
interest on the part of a congressman is obvious.
   At first it sounds plausible to argue that the limitation makes
it unlikely a congressman will be influenced. But many congressmen
receive up to $2,000 from each of several companies.
   When members of Congress take money from companies that do
business with the government, they are at least giving the
impression that their votes are for sale. The people deserve better.

   Daily News of Los Angeles on volunteerism to help the needy:
   In an era of limits, who can best help the poor?
   Republican George Bush implies an answer when he speaks of an
America made better by a ``thousand points of light'' _ his way of
referring to the voluntary efforts Americans must make to help each
other as government programs are reduced.
   The opposite party likes to scoff at such talk, and Bush's
opponent, Michael Dukakis, professes not even to understand it. ...
   There's a strong argument in favor of letting churches and other
groups of private citizens take over some of the front-line
charitable duties that had been assumed in recent years by
government.
   If nothing else, they are much closer than government to the
problems they must deal with.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on removing buried lethal devices in
Afghanistan:
   Afghanistan is sprinkled with hundreds of thousands of booby
traps, mines and the like.
   Happily, the United Nations plans to teach mine and bomb
disposal techniques to selected refugees in Iran and Pakistan, and
to alert millions of others to the danger.
   That is good, but another thought presses forward: Why shouldn't
the erstwhile combatants, in particular the Soviets, do the lion's
share of this work under U.N. supervision?
   Those who sowed these lethal devices should be responsible for
defusing them.

   Spencer (W.Va.) Times-Record on welfare reform:
   Members of Congress took action (last) week that could provide

   The compromise contains among its stipulations one that would
require one adult in a two-parent welfare family to work, receive
on-the-job training or perform community service at least 16 hours
per week, the equivalent of two eight-hour work days.
   This federally mandated work program, coined ``workfare'' since
the idea began to take hold, is not without its critics who prefer
to call the provision ``slavefare.''
   We wonder where they were when the old-fashioned value of
working for what you have or doing without, was being taught.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on recyling garbage:
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency called on state and
local governments the other day to step up programs for recycling
of household wastes.
   At present, only 10 percent of American wastes are recycled,
compared to half in Japan and some West European countries. Another
10 percent is incinerated and most of the rest goes into landfills.
   The federal agency has set a goal of having 25 percent of U.S.
wastes recycled.
   Since Washington is limited in how far it can go to solve an
essentially local problem, the EPA is undertaking a largely
promotional campaign.
   Most people in America's throwaway society don't take to the
idea of segregating household waste. But the growing problem of
disposing of it in an environmentally sound manner soon will
require that state and local governments compel them to do it.
   If Washington can give the recycling process a nudge, that's to
the good.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on Chrysler negotiations:
   A $250 million settlement from Chrysler Corp. does not come

automaker decided to cut operations in Kenosha. ...
   The package is ``the best achievable under the circumstances,''
said Gov. Tommy Thompson.
   That's a good assessment.
   There was talk when Chrysler announced its pullout of two
possible legal actions.
   One was a lawsuit contending that the automaker broke a contract
with the state. The other was a restraining order or injunction
ordering the firm to continue operations (in Wisconsin).
   There is no guarantee either action would have been successful.
   The courts do act oddly at times. But it is hard to imagine a
court telling a corporation that it must continue an inefficient or
unprofitable operation.

   Republican George Bush today declined an
invitation to appear with Democrat Michael Dukakis on the ABC-TV
program ``Nightline'' _ outside the tight restrictions of their
other two debates _ after Dukakis had accepted the offer.
   The network invited both candidates to ``engage in an open-ended
discussion concerning the issues being raised in the 1988
presidential campaign,'' Roone Arledge, ABC News president, said in
a statement.
   Dukakis spokesman Dayton Duncan said today, ``We thought it was
a great opportunity for the American people to get beyond the
slogans and balloons and bring George Bush out from behind the flag
and get him to talk about the issues.''
   Duncan said ABC left open the possibility of Dukakis going on
alone with the program's host, Ted Koppel, but that nothing was
definite.
   Bush spokesman Mark Goodin said the campaign had rejected the
invitation.
   ``We're not going to do it. An open-ended disucussion of the
issues is a debate,'' Goodin said.
   ``We committed the campaign to two debates. The American people
will have, at the conclusion of the debates, an opportunity to look
at both candidates. Frankly, our campaign schedule requires the
candiate to be on the road after the second debate, taking his
message to the voters directly,'' he said.

   A throng of teen-agers at a Christian rock
show broke a barricade as they pushed their way toward the stage
after promoters announced the show's opening act would not perform,
witnesses said.
   A barricade made of scaffolding and plywood gave way under the
rush of fans at the Tuesday night concert by Stryper, a nationally
known group that bills itself as a Christian heavy metal rock band.
   After the problem with the opening act was announced, Stryper's
performance as the main act was delayed for an hour.
   No injuries were reported. A small fire broke out when some
electrical wiring was trampled, according to officials and
witnesses. It was extinguished without incident.
   The barricade, which was intended to separate spectators from
the stage, was removed when it became structurally unsound, said
Paul Johnson, manager of the Bismarck Civic Center. Johnson
estimated the crowd at 3,350.
   ``As soon as the barricade started to bend, the concert stopped
and we assessed the situation,'' said Johnson.
   One of the concertgoers said the rush of fans toward the stage
was caused by the announcement that the opening act, White Lion,
would not appear.

bruises on her ribs.

   U.S. Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay won the
Democratic Senate runoff and said he would try to heal wounds from
the divisive race while looking ahead to a ``mainstream versus
extreme'' contest with Republican Connie Mack.
   State Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter, who Tuesday lost a
runoff to MacKay in his third try at the Senate, put on a MacKay
button today in Tallahassee, the state capital. The two pledged to
put behind what Gunter had called one of the ugliest campaigns in
state history.
   ``We've had our differences, we're together now; we're going to
go forward,'' said MacKay, a third-term congressman.
   Unofficial returns from Tuesday's runoff gave MacKay 362,234, or
52 percent of the vote, to Gunter's 330,297, or 48 percent.
   Mack, a former Cape Coral bank president and grandson of the
baseball Hall of Fame manager, is a well-funded conservative whose
candidacy is drawing national Republican help. He won the GOP
primary on Sept. 6, getting more than half the votes so that a
runoff wasn't necessary.
   Mack and MacKay will face each other on the November ballot for
the seat held by Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles, who is retiring
after three terms.
   ``We are the candidacy that can beat Connie Mack,'' MacKay said
Tuesday night. ``I see this election as mainstream versus extreme.''
   Mack agreed that voters faced an ideological decision.
   ``I think the voters in Florida are going to have a very clear
choice between the liberal Buddy MacKay and the conservative Connie
Mack,'' he said.
   The Senate runoff climaxed twisting events that began last
December, when Chiles, 58, announced he wouldn't seek re-election,
saying he was burned out by the Senate and didn't like the high
cost of running for re-election.
   Popular former two-term Gov. Reubin Askew then entered the race
against Mack. But Askew, well ahead in all polls, withdrew May 7,
saying he didn't like all the time spent raising funds.
   Gunter and MacKay jumped in after Askew pulled out, and they ran
one-two in the Sept. 6 primary. But neither received a majority,
making a runoff necessary.
   MacKay, a lawyer from a wealthy landowning family, was endorsed
by Askew, 1986 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Steve Pajcic,
third-place primary finisher Rep. Dan Mica and fourth-place
finisher state Sen. Patricia Frank.
   The runoff campaign was filled with negative advertising and
sharp exchanges in debates, and Democratic officials worried that
Mack would face a crippled opponent in the general election.
   MacKay, 55, attacked Gunter's integrity for his practice each
election of using campaign contributions from the insurance
industry he regulates, including from two companies that later
collapsed in corruption. He also charged that Gunter voted against
desegregation 15 years ago.
   Gunter, 54, charged that MacKay's congressional record betrayed
Israel, Social Security and anti-drug efforts, and he claimed
MacKay was being supported by corrupt defense contractors.
   MacKay warned that the well-funded Mack could exploit Gunter's
alleged ethics problems. Mack, meanwhile, went on the attack
against MacKay, running television and newspaper ads charging:
``Hey Buddy, You're liberal!''
   Gunter lost a 1974 Democratic Senate runoff and won a 1980
Senate runoff only to lose in the general election.

southern Tanzania and destroyed 39 homes and left 173 people
homeless, Radio Tanzania reported Wednesday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, reported no deaths or
injuries in the fire Sunday at Chawa village in the southeastern
Mtwara region. Officials there said the village was surrounded by
high grass and that the area had not had rain since July.

   Dr. George Hatem, an American physician who
devoted his medical career to eradicating venereal diseases in the
People's Republic of China, has died in Beijing, state university
officials said.
   Hatem, 78, who died Sunday, had been hospitalized since Aug. 4.
He had been diagnosed as having cancer and diabetes.
   Once called the most beloved American in China, he is widely
credited with ridding the world's most populous nation of most
syphilis and gonorrhea, and he had hoped to eliminate leprosy from
the country by the year 2000.
   In mainland China he was known as Dr. Ma Hai-teh, meaning
``virtue from overseas.'' During the 1950s, he became the first
foreigner to become a Chinese citizen.
   Officials at the State University of New York at Buffalo said a
cousin of Hatem's, who had received a cable from the doctor's
widow, informed them of his death.
   Dr. Steven B. Sample, president of the university, presented
Hatem an honorary doctor of science degree last year in Beijing.
   ``Over the past half-century, he led the fight against dreadful
diseases like cholera, venereal disease and leprosy in China and in
the process saved the lives of many millions of Chinese,'' Sample
said.
   The son of Lebanese immigrants, Shafick Hatem _ his first name
was Americanized to George _ grew up in Buffalo.
   His medical career may have had its roots in an influenza
epidemic in 1918, when his entire family was stricken. He recalled
later how his family received care from a kindly doctor who made
house calls and accepted no payment.
   With an undergraduate degree from the University of North
Carolina, Hatem started his medical studies at the American
University in Beirut and received his medical degree from the
University of Geneva in Switzerland. In 1933, he and two other
doctors went to Shanghai to study tropical diseases. Hatem never
came back.
   Shortly after his arrival in China, Hatem became friends with
journalist Edgar Snow. When Mao Tse-tung became head of the
Communist Party, he sent word to Shanghai that he wanted a
``Western-trained doctor and an honest journalist.'' Snow and Hatem
managed to get through the Nationalist army lines to the
Communists, where they first met Chou En-lai, then Mao.
   Hatem returned to Shanghai when the Red Army took over China in
1949.
   As chief of staff of the Chinese Institute of Dermatology and
Venereology, he set up a patriotic health movement. His first
targets were acute communicable diseases such as cholera and
smallpox.
   The next battle, against venereal diseases, involved going to
brothels, treating the infected prostitutes and shutting down the
brothels within 48 hours. The women were retrained in other jobs.
   Hatem is survived by his wife, Ssu-fei; a son; a daughter; a
sister; and two grandchildren.

   Nine people were hospitalized Wednesday
after a hand grenade blew up in an explosives factory near Lisbon,
hospital officials said.
   The grenade exploded Tuesday afternoon at a factory of the
Portuguese Explosives Company in Santa Marta de Corroios, 12 miles
south of Lisbon, said the factory's director, Carlos Pimenta Araujo.
   He said the blast detonated other explosives stored nearby.
   Speaking on Portuguese television Wednesday, Araujo said the
explosion was probably caused by human error.
   Doctors at San Jose Hospital in Lisbon said two of the injured
were in critical condition but the rest of the injuries were not
major.

   Police placed security around seven clinics that
perform abortions today, bracing for more demonstrations of the
type that put more than 350 people in jail on Tuesday.
   Demonstrators said authorities impounded one of their buses,
forcing a delay in the second day of what they called the ``siege
of Atlanta.''
   Police did not immediately confirm the impoundment report but
said they would continue the rough tactics that brought complaints
from demonstration leaders and some civil libertarians. They had
announced last week that the relatively gentle tactics used on
previous demonstrations would be discontinued.
   ``I could not believe the level of brutality that was going on
here,'' protest leader Randall Terry said Tuesday as police dragged
or carried protesters who resisted arrest by crawling on hands and
knees.
   Backers of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue tried but
failed to close three clinics with sit-ins Tuesday and said they
would hit one today but did not identify it in advance.
   Police spokeswoman Myrna May said she had no immediate details
on the group's claim that a bus was impounded, because she could
not get in touch with the officers involved to check it out. A
spokeswoman for the demonstrators said the impoundment would delay
this morning's planned demonstration until afternoon.
   Ms. May said most of those arrested Tuesday were charged with
criminal trespass and that none had posted bail. Court appearances
were scheduled to begin late this afternoon.
   Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Nolte had complained Tuesday
evening that the protesters were not being processed properly or
read their rights.
   Over the summer, the New York-based group led demonstrations at
Atlanta clinics over several weeks during and after the Democratic
National Convention, resulting in 700 arrests. Three of the 700
remain in jail.
   Most clinics followed their usual schedule Tuesday, said Lynne
Randall, executive director of one of the clinics.
   Most of those arrested were charged with criminal trespass and
identified themselves as Baby Jane Doe or Baby John Doe, Ms. May
said.
   That identification tactic was used in earlier protests, with
protesters saying they were expressing solidarity with what they
called the anonymous victims of abortion. Authorities have refused
to release protesters who wouldn't give their real names.
   At a rally Tuesday night at St. Jude the Apostle Roman Catholic
Church in suburbs north of Atlanta, Terry urged about 600 people to
join today's protests.
   But only about 75 people said they would participate, and
remained for coaching on tactics.
   Protesters complained that police treated them with unnecessary
harshness, twisting arms and fingers and using pressure-point holds
just under the ears to force them off the street and into buses.
Some screamed or cried as they were taken away.
   Police asked the protesters if they would walk to the buses
before hauling them off when they refused.
   Gene Guerrero, executive director of the Georgia chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said he asked the city to abandon
pressure-point holds.
   However, he said, ``I've been to a lot of demonstrations and
I've seen a lot of police brutality. I haven't seen that today.''
   Guerrero, who joined abortion rights advocates in helping escort
women through the demonstrators to the clinics Tuesday, said
Operation Rescue was going beyond the limits of free speech.
   ``There is a real interference now,'' he said.
   Protest organizers complained that the police's tactics, which
they had been warned about, led to the injury of the Rev. Doyle
Clark, a demonstrator in his late 50s who is pastor of a church in
Hudson, Ind.
   Clark said he was dropped on his head as police carried him to a
bus, according to Grady Memorial Hospital spokesman William Breyer.
Breyer said Clark, who was being kept in the hospital's detention
unit, would probably be treated and returned to jail.
   In addition to trespass charges, participants in this week's
protests face fines up to $500 for contempt of court if they
violate a Superior Court judge's order limiting the demonstrations.
   The order bans demonstrators from coming within 5 feet of a
clinic's property lines and limits the number of pickets to 25 per
clinic.
   Terry and others said they would ignore the order.
   Terry was arrested Monday night on charges of conspiracy to
commit a crime, but was freed before Tuesday's demonstration after
an unidentified family posted $75,000 bond.

   Federal investigators said today some food
prices have risen faster than warranted by the drought but a Senate
chairman said there's no proof so far of significant price gouging.
   ``Some price increases do appear higher than warranted by the
drought alone,'' Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., told a hearing of
his Senate Agriculture Committee. He said the higher levels were
``most notably in wheat-based food products, such as pasta and
bread, and in some meats.''
   ``But in general there do not seem to have been excessive price
increases across a broad range of products that use the drought as
an excuse,'' he said.
   The hearing was held to unveil a report from the General
Accounting Office on food price increases between July and August.
The report was requested by Leahy and Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., in
July amid speculation that the food industry would seize on the
drought to hike prices.
   A General Accounting Office official, John Harman, told the
committee some price increases found by the congressional
investigative agency could not be explained by the drought. He
pointed to a 6 percent jump in pasta prices between the July and
August checks that the agency made.
   A rise of 3.4 percent would be warranted by the impact of the
drought on durham wheat used to make pasta, he said. He added that
cattle prices dropped as a result of the drought but that was not
reflected by the cost of beef.
   Just why there were some unexplained increases was unclear, he
said.
   It may have been because ``prices of packaging of food products
went up significantly this year,'' GAO aide Mary Kenney told the
panel.
   ``There could have been some labor cost increases ... we don't
know if there were,'' Harman said.
   ``Conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found but
there are some indications out there'' that suggest it could
materialize in the future, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told the
hearing packed with lobbyists from the nation's
multi-billion-dollar food industry.
   ``My advice to consumers is to be comparative shoppers,'' he
said.
   ``Food processors and retailers need to know that we are all
watching and they must be held accountable for any food price
increases not directly attributable to higher costs,'' Leahy and
Dorgan said in a statement released Tueslday night.
   The study showed that the price of ground beef has increased 3
percent, while the price that livestock producers get for cattle
actually has dropped 11 percent since April.
   Rising feed prices have accelerated the sale of cattle and thus
created a buyers' market.
   Fruit prices rose an average of 12 percent, while bread prices
increased 4 percent, according to the GAO.
   The lawmakers stressed that the GAO figures represented national
averages and that there could be differences from one region to
another.
   Two consumer organizations issued a report on Monday saying
there had been no ``price gouging'' in July and August but
``substantial'' increases in beef and some other agricultural goods
in June.
   The report was issued jointly by the Consumer Federation of
America and Washington-based advocacy group, Public Voice on Food,
Health and Policy.

   A U.S. State Department official
said today there was no sign any of the nine American held hostage
in Lebanon would be freed soon.
   A State Department team today began questioning Mithileshwar
Singh, an Indian who was freed from captivity in Lebanon on Monday,
in hopes of learning the fate of the Americans, the Washington
official added.
   The official told reporters at the U.S. Air Force hospital in
Wiesbaden this afternoon: ``One wants to be encouraged that they
(the hostages) will be released, but we really don't know.''
   Asked about the American hostages, he said: ``There are no
indications that others are coming out.''
   The official, who is an expert on hostage issues, requested
strict anonymity, although he was speaking at a news conference
before several dozen journalists. Television crews were ordered not
to film his remarks, and the lights were lowered.
   Earlier today, doctors said Singh was ``in good spirits'' but
would stay in West Germany for another three days of medical tests.
   Dr. Robert W. Gilmore, head of the Air Force hospital, said a
preliminary examination indicated Singh, a 60-year-old diabetic,
received adequate medical treatment during his 20 months of
captivity.
   ``He lost significant weight and muscle mass. But he was
afforded visits by a physician and treatment was appropriate for
his illnesses,'' Gilmore said of the Indian finance professor.
   The doctor said tests done since Singh's arrival confirmed his
previously known medical problems _ diabetes, hypertension and
``possible coronary artery disease.''
   ``Overall Dr. Singh is in good spirits and though very fatigued
has traveled well,'' Gilmore said.
   He said Singh, a resident alien of the United States, would
likely remain in Wiesbaden for another three days of medical tests.
   Singh was freed Monday night in Beirut, and taken to Damascus,
Syria. He was flown from the Syrian capital to the U.S. Air Force's
Rhein-Main Base outside Frankfurt, arriving at 2:20 a.m.
   The former hostage did not speak to reporters upon arriving in
West Germany. He was immediately driven to the Air Force hospital
in Wiesbaden, 24 miles west of Frankfurt.
   Singh's release leaves 16 foreigners missing in Lebanon and
believed held by Moslem extremists. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Armed men dressed as policemen took Singh hostage Jan. 24, 1987,
on the Beirut University College campus in Moslem west Beirut,
along with American educators Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility, and said it freed Singh as a
goodwill gesture. Nearly all the foreign hostages in Lebanon are
believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran.
   In Syria, Singh said the three American educators were ``OK.''
   Then he added: ``It's better for me not to make any statements
because we don't know what might hurt them ... Please let me be
quiet ... It's better for my colleagues.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
U.S. government was doing ``everything possible'' to free the
hostages.
   President Reagan said Tuesday that no negotiations would be held
with the captors. He said liberating the hostages ``has been a
great problem for us and it's very much on our minds.''
   In Paris, former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said an
aide to Vice President George Bush named Richard Lawless negotiated
Singh's release and that Iran received arms _ possibly in a deal to
free him.
   However, former Bani-Sadr said Tuesday he did not know if the
shipment of weapons was related to the release. He gave no details
of the purported weapons transfer.
   He said representatives of Bush, the Republican presidential
nominee, and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis
attended talks in Iran in an effort to free hostages. Spokesmen for
both campaigns denied the assertions.
   Singh expressed regret Tuesday that the Americans were not
released with him.
   ``Thank God I'm free,'' he said. ``But I'm very sorry that my
colleagues and friends are still in captivity. I hope they'll be
free soon.''
   Singh said the four captives ``lived together, but I did not see
anyone else.''

   Dazed survivors wandered the streets of Sverdlovsk
and flames shot 1,000 feet above the city after two freight cars
collided with a coal train and exploded, according to witness
accounts published Wednesday.
   Monday's explosion blasted a crater 200 feet wide and smashed 20
apartment buildings to rubble in the city 850 miles east of Moscow,
reporter Vladimir Sanatin wrote in Komsomolskaya Pravda.
   He wrote that he found a mother who had lived in one of the
buildings wandering in the street and repeating: ``I snatched him
from under the plaster. Seryozha, my son. He's 5 years old. And
he's alive!''
   Four people were killed and 500 sought medical care, the
newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reported. Of those, 90 were
hospitalized.
   Initial reports Tuesday said 280 people sought medical care and
that 87 were hospitalized.
   The latest reports said 359 families were left homeless.
   The explosions blasted a 30-foot-deep crater, set fire to tanks
of oil and gas and blanketed Sverdlovsk with dark smoke, the
government paper Izvestia said.
   The explosions damaged 108 stores, 86 restaurants and seven
hospitals, said Sovietskaya Rossiya. Glass was broken five miles
away from the railyard, Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said firefighters guarded other damaged oil
tanks to prevent the blaze from setting off more explosions.
   The accounts in the state-run media did not identify the
explosives. They said only that they were for use in the domestic
economy.
   The disaster was the latest in a series of major accidents that
have prompted sharp criticism of the heavily used Soviet rail
system.
   An express passenger train crashed on its way from Leningrad to
Moscow on Aug. 17, killing 24 people and injuring more than 100.
   In June, three box cars loaded with explosives blew up in the
industrial city of Arzamas about 240 miles east of Moscow. Eighty
people died in that blast and 229 were injured.
   The press accounts blamed the Sverdlovsk explosion on a
dispatcher who ordered the freight train to halt at the wrong
location on a track leading into the railyard. The cars loaded with
explosives became disconnected from the locomotive and started
rolling away.
   Engineer V. Pimenov managed to reconnect the locomotive, but
could not stop the train before it slammed through a junction into
the coal train, the reports said. A commission was formed to
investigate the accident.

   The Reagan administration is studying
prospects for seeking congressional approval for the release of
$16.5 million in military aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   ``We are analyzing that possibility,'' Fitzwater told reporters
at his daily briefing. ``A final decision has not been made.''
   The spokesman noted that language in the recently-signed
Pentagon appropriations bill permits Reagan to request a separate
congressional vote on whether to release those weapons to the
rebels.
   There is $16 million of stockpiled military goods in Honduras.
It was purchased with earlier money, which has been frozen because
of the peace process and cease-fire between two sides.
   Congressional leaders say chances for approval of such an
maneuver would be a long-shot at best.
   The bill ``authorizes the release of $16 million in lethal
material that had been purchased earlier but had not been delivered
... and it sets forth findings that the president would make in
requesting that release,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said that under the legislation the president must
find that Nicaragua has caused a crisis in Central America, must
consult with the four Central American democracies and must then
justify the request to Congress.
   He said the president's justification for the release of the aid
must also meet two of three conditions cited in the legislation.
   Of the three, Fitzwater said, the administration believed that
two had been met _ continuing unacceptable levels of Soviet aid and
Sandinista violations of the peace accords.
   Fitzwater said the third condition _ that the Sandinistas have
initiated an ``all-out attack'' against the Contras _ was ``an open
question.''
   ``The status is, it's all under consideration and we haven't
made a formal decision,'' the spokesman said.
   Although congressional leaders had once hoped to close their
session by the end of September, continued wrangling over such
matters as anti-drug legislation may keep lawmakers in Washington
until next week.

   Mankind needs to begin considering how it will
cope with a warmer climate in the future, instead of just trying to
figure out ways to head off the ``greenhouse effect'' on the
atmosphere, a scientist said Wednesday.
   ``One effect (of warming) could be to present us with a future
that is remarkably different from the present,'' said William E.
Riebsame of the University of Colorado.
   ``We ought to be thinking, as a society, about how we can adapt
to changes,'' Riebsame, director of the Natural Hazards Research
and Applications Center at the school, told a symposium sponsored
by a consortium of Colorado colleges.
   ``We all know that climate has changed on this planet in the
past ... and it's likely to change again,'' agreed Thomas H. Vonder
Haar, who heads Cooperative Institute for Research in the
Atmosphere at Colorado State University.
   The hot, dry summer of 1988 helped attract considerable
attention to the greenhouse phenomenon. Scientists believe the
effect occurs when increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other
gases trap the heat of the sun, warming the planet, although they
are not sure if this summer was an example or was just unusually
hot.
   Response to warnings about climate change have concentrated on
legislation and international agreements seeking to reduce the
gases involved, in hopes of preventing the overheating of the Earth.
   That is a worthwhile effort, Riebsame said, noting that the
effort could also reduce acid rain and reduce fossil fuel use.
``But some climate change is going to occur anyway,'' he said.
   ``The bottom line is, it doesn't take much change to put you in
new social conditions,'' Riebsame said ``Small changes in means
(averages) can bring large changes in extremes.''
   Some researchers have estimated that the greenhouse effect could
increase the planet's average temperature by 2 degrees to 3 degrees
Celsius (3.2 to 4.8 degrees Fahrenheit) over the next few decades,
Riebsame said.
   That may not sound like much, but the seemingly small numbers
give a false sense of security, he said.
   For example, the decade of the 1930s, the Dust Bowl years that
parched the nation in the worst heat and drought on record,
averaged only 1.2 degrees Celsius above normal, he pointed out.
   ``I'm not saying we're going to hell in a hand basket, but we
need an insurance policy,'' said Riebsame.
   At the least, he said, ``we ought to be looking at past climate
changes and asking ourselves, what would we do if that happened
today to come through with flying colors.''
   Pinning our hopes on avoiding the greenhouse warming would be a
mistake, he said. Instead, research needs to be done on adaptation,
new methods of agriculture, forestry, flexible planning for change
and reconsideration of the policy of seeking a maximum sustained
yield from the land.
   Warming will change crop growth patterns, water availability and
many other things, Riebsame noted. This year, for example, low
water disrupted transportation on the Mississippi River.
   A variety of potential threats have been reported by scientists
looking into the greenhouse effect, including a northward shift in
the major grain growing areas, drought in many areas and melting of
the polar ice caps, resulting in a rise in sea levels that could
threaten coastal communities with inundation.
   The planet's average temperature has warmed about one-half
degree Celsius in the last century, Riebsame noted, a period when
industrial development sharply increased the carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere.

   Michigan computer expert David Brown, owner
of Data Recovery Inc., knew there was a David Brown with a Data
Recovery in California, but the coincidence didn't bother him until
the other was charged with murder.
   David Ira Brown, 39, of Farmington Hills, Mich., said he became
seriously concerned when he learned a friend in the computer
industry had received 20 telexes and calls wanting to know ``what
in God's name had gotten into me.''
   He said he wants everyone, particularly his 100 clients
nationwide, to know that he and his company are different from the
California David Brown and his company.
   The man jailed 2,000 miles away in a case that drew national
attention is David Arnold Brown, 35, of Anaheim, who was charged
last month with murdering his wife for $1 million insurance in 1985
and getting his teen-age daughter to take the blame.
   The daughter, Cinnamon, now 18, was found hours after the
slaying, in a backyard doghouse, suffering from a drug overdose.
She clutched a note that read, ``Dear God, please forgive me. I
didn't mean to hurt her.''
   Prosecutors filed charges against her father after Cinnamon,
having served three years in a youth detention center, began
talking.
   The Michigan Brown, 39, said Tuesday by telephone that he knew
of the California man and the identical business name and had
talked to him about it at least three years ago. ``We kind of
laughed about it,'' he said.
   He learned of the arrest a week and half ago.
   ``A friend that's in the computer business called me at home
Monday (Sept. 26) and said, `Guess who's in jail for murder?' and I
just jokingly said, `I dunno, your brother George?' and he said,
`Sit down.'He says, `David Brown, owner of Data Recovery.' I said,
`What kind of joke is this?' He said, `A guy out in California.'''
   The next day he was installing computer equipment for a customer
when a worker he has known for years came in, sat down and told him
she was going to ask something that no one else had the nerve to
ask.
   She handed him a front-page article on the arrest, he said.
``After I read the article she said, `What have you got to do with
that?' I looked at her and I said, `Well, obviously nothing. I'm
not in jail.'''
   Records at Anaheim City Hall show that David Arnold Brown took
out a license in 1982 for the name Data Recovery@Data Safe
Technology. In 1988 he received a license for the name Data
Recovery.
   David Ira Brown said Data Recovery Inc. was incorporated in
Michigan in 1981.
   The Michigan Brown, who has been married for 17 years, said his
parents advised him to change the name of the company, which does
about $600,000 to $700,000 business a year, but he doesn't want to
because of the reputation he has established.
   He said he hasn't lost any clients but calls ``have been very
sparse this week.''
   ``All of the customers that I have talked with have apologized
up and down for even thinking it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Ghost Haunts Moscow Dormitory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dormitory for women workers has a ghost that
steals boots and plays ``Knock-Knock'' with some of the residents,
a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The labor daily Trud said the ghost was discovered three weeks
ago by three young housepainters who live in the Moscow dormitory.
   It said they had learned to communicate with the specter by a
code system of knocks _ one for yes and two for no.
   When two Trud reporters visited the dormitory, the specter had
stolen a boot, according to the paper's account. The women asked
several questions and got one knock, for yes, after asking whether
the boot was behind a shelf.
   Trud said the painters became aware of the ghost in
mid-September when it knocked loudly on a door and began making the
door open and close one night.
   ``Although specialists are in no hurry to pronounce themselves
definitively, it seems more and more likely that in these and
several other similar situations what is occuring is a rare natural
phenomenon _ a poltergeist,'' the report said.
   A poltergeist is defined as a noisy and usually mischievous
ghost held responsible for unexplained noises, such as rappings.
   Although Soviet society is officially materialist, there is
enormous interest here in flying saucers, the Bermuda Triangle,
ghosts, extrasensory perception and such real or imaginary monsters
as the Abominable Snowman.
   Even the staid Soviet Academy of Sciences has a commission ``on
abnormal phenomena.''
   Trud asked commission chairman V. Troitsky to comment on the
dormitory ghost and quoted him as replying: ``In our country, the
principle is still current that these things can't happen, because
they could never happen.''

<HEAD>White House May Seek Release of Stockpiled Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House is considering asking Congress
to soon release $16.5 million in stockpiled weapons to the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Wednesday.
   ``We are analyzing that possibility,'' Fitwater told reporters
at his daily briefing. ``A final decision has not been made at this
point.''
   Prospects for renewing military aid to the rebels has been
deemed a long shot by congressional leaders, who hope to have the
Senate and House adjourn for the year next week so that lawmakers
can campaign full-time for re-election.
   Congress rejected an administration military aid request last
Feb. 3 and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the Contras
occurred on Feb. 29.
   Some $16.5 million in military equipment has been stockpiled in
Honduras. It was purchased with earlier U.S. aid, but its delivery
was frozen because of the peace process and cease-fire between the
Contras and Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.
   Asked about the possibility of renewed aid, Fitzwater noted that
a provision in defense appropriations bill Reagan signed last
weekend permits the president to request a congressional vote on
whether to release the weapons to the rebels.
   The Pentagon bill ``authorizes the release of $16 million in
lethal material that had been purchased earlier but had not been
delivered ... and it sets forth findings that the president would
make in requesting that release,'' the spokesman said.
   He noted that under the legislation, the president must find
that Nicaragua has caused a crisis in Central America, the
administration must consult with the four Central American
democracies and then report to Congress justifying his request.
   Fitzwater said the president's justification for the release of
the aid must also meet two out of three conditions cited in the
legislation.
   Of the three, he said, the administration believes two had been
met _ continuing unacceptable levels of Soviet aid and Sandinista
violations of the peace accords.
   The spokesman called the third condition _ that the Sandinistas
have initiated an ``all-out attack'' against the Contras _ ``an
open question.''
   ``The status is, it's all under consideration and we haven't
made a formal decision,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Elvis Presley's daughter married a young
musician she's been dating for three years during a private
ceremony this week at the Church of Scientology, her publicist said
today.
   Lisa Marie Presley, 20, and musician Danny Keogh, 23, recited
wedding vows Monday during the small service at the huge Hollywood
headquarters for the church, Paul Bloch said. He offered few
details about the ceremony.
   ``In attendance were the mother of the bride, actress Priscilla
Beaulieu Presley, family and a few close friends,'' said Bloch, who
represents the mother and daughter.
   ``Im thrilled for Lisa Marie,'' Bloch quoted the mother of the
bride as saying. ``Danny is a great guy and I couldn't be happier
for the two of them.''
   It was the first marriage for each.
   Miss Presley is the only heir of the rock superstar, who died in
1977. Under the terms of the singer's will, when she turns 25 she
will inherit an estate that was reportedly estimated to be worth
$50 million as of 1987. The estate includes Presley's landmark,
tourist-attraction mansion in Memphis, Tenn., Graceland.
   Her parents met when Presley was doing military service in
Germany in the late 1950s, when she was 14. They married in 1967
and Miss Presley was born the following year. The marriage ended in
divorce in 1973, four years before Presley died.
   Miss Presley and her new husband were currently on a honeymoon
at an unknown location, said Bloch. They live in Los Angeles.
   ``I have been told they are both very, very happy,'' the
publicist said.
   Miss Presley, whom Bloch described only as a Los Angeles
businesswoman, recently completed an Oldsmobile television
commercial with her mother. ``They always wanted to do something
together,'' said Bloch.
   Bloch had no details on Keogh's career.

   Nine-year-old Leah Wilbanks talked of
fishing with her dad as lawmen expanded their search Wednesday for
a punk-haired gunman who shot the youngster while she did
cartwheels on her school playground.
   The blonde third-grader clutched a new fishing reel and argued
with her father about who would catch the biggest fish when she
gets out of an Orlando hospital.
   She remained in serious condition but ``that little sparkle was
back in her eye,'' her grandmother, Dolly Chapman said late Tuesday.
   Police said a skinny, bearded man in camouflage clothes fled
after firing Monday into the playground filled with children at
Mascotte Elementary School. Residents of this farm and grove
community in central Florida joined the hunt.
   The motive for the shooting was unknown, police said.
   ``I'm just hoping and praying for the big break to come,'' said
Police Chief Don Page. ``It's been an awful stress on mothers and
fathers.''
   Lake County Sheriff Noel Griffin Jr. said officers had
identified ``a good suspect'' believed to be still in the county.
Others described the suspect as a drifter known to have sought odd
jobs around the area.
   Officers combed woods and wetlands, knocked on doors, escorted
school buses and patrolled schools in Mascotte and nearby. A
hitchhiker on the main road through town said different officers
stopped him three times to check him out.
   Leah, an avid angler and cheerleader, was hit in the arm and
chest by one of three shots fired into the fenced playground, said
sheriff's Capt. Randy Swails.
   The gunman wore in his hair in a punk style, spiked on top and
shaved on the sides, police said.
   Twenty-four other third-graders and a physical education teacher
on the playground were not injured.

   There are no signs that the nine
American hostages in Lebanon will be freed soon, despite the
release of an Indian captive, a U.S. State Department official said
Wednesday.
   Doctors said former hostage Mithileshwar Singh was in good
spirits but under tremendous stress.
   The official said a State Department debriefing team started
questioning Singh, an Indian citizen and resident alien of the
United States, in hopes of learning about the American hostages.
   Singh went to the U.S. Air Force Hospital in Wiesbaden early
Wednesday, two days after his captors released him in Beirut in
what they said was a goodwill gesture. Sixteen foreign hostages are
still held in Lebanon.
   ``One wants to be encouraged that they will be released, but we
really don't know,'' the U.S. official said at the hospital.
``There are no indications that others are coming out.''
   The official, an expert on hostage issues, spoke on condition of
strict anonymity at a news conference. Television crews were
ordered not to film the comments, and the lights were dimmed.
   Of those holding hostages in Lebanon, the State Department
official said: ``It is our opinion that they are under the
influence of Iran, and are part of Hezbollah.''
   He added later: ``There are indications that they (the
kidnappers) are backed by Iran, we assume financed by Iran.''
   A team of 10 to 12 State Department officials flew to Wiesbaden
on Wednesday to interview Singh, 60, who was a captive for 20
months.
   Singh said after his release that three American educators
abducted with him were ``OK.''
   ``It's better for me not to make any statements because we don't
know what might hurt them,'' he said. ``Please let me be quiet. ...
It's better for my colleagues.''
   Singh flew to Frankfurt aboard a military transport plane. He
has not spoken to reporters since he arrived in West Germany.
   Dr. Robert W. Gilmore, head of the Wiesbaden hospital, told
reporters that a preliminary examination indicated Singh was given
adequate medical treatment during his captivity.
   ``He lost significant weight and muscle mass. But he was
afforded visits by a physician and treatment was appropriate for
his illnesses,'' Gilmore said.
   Gilmore said the kidnappers allowed a doctor to visit Singh
twice a week.
   He said testing done in Wiesbaden confirmed his previously known
problems of diabetes, hypertension and ``possible coronary artery
disease.''
   ``Overall, Dr. Singh is in good spirits and though very fatigued
has traveled well,'' Gilmore said.
   Gilmore said Singh lost 35 to 40 pounds during his ordeal. He
said the kidnappers agreed to respect Singh's vegetarian diet.
   ``There is tremendous stress,'' Gilmore said, however. ``Singh
is exhausted.
   He said Singh probably would stay for three more days of medical
tests in Wiesbaden, about 25 miles west of Frankfurt.
   Gilmore said Singh told officials that he wants to return to
Colorado after the tests. Singh taught at the now-defunct Western
Colorado University before moving to Beirut.
   His release leaves nine Americans and seven other foreigners
still missing in Lebanon. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was abducted
March 16, 1985.
   Armed men dressed as policemen took Singh hostage Jan. 24, 1987,
on the Beirut University College campus in Moslem west Beirut,
along with Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.
   A group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility. Nearly all the foreign hostages
in Lebanon are believed held by Shiite Moslem groups loyal to Iran.
   The U.S. government has said it is not involved in direct
negotiations with Iran.

   A slow, underground coal fire
discovered by the children plunging sticks into the ground should
be put out as soon as possible because it poses a threat to lives
and property, officials said Wednesday.
   State and local officials who surveyed the site on a wooded
hillside overlooking a city street proposed that the U.S. Office of
Surface Mining consider the fire an emergency to keep it from
spreading.
   The agency sent a representative to investigate.
   The fire was discovered Friday after parents of children who had
been playing on the hillside notified the Fire Department.
   ``They had been sticking sticks in the ground, poking them down,
and when they pulled them back up, they were on fire, and they were
really fascinated by that,'' said Tim Baden, fire chief in this
southeastern Ohio city of 5,000.
   ``When we arrived, there were three or four trees on fire and a
very hot spot on the ground.''
   The fire appeared to be in waste coal from a nearby unmapped
mine believed abandoned since the 1920s, said Mitchell Farley of
the Ohio Department of Natural Resources' Division of Reclamation.
   The fire posed no immediate threat to two houses about 60 feet
away. But as many as 30 houses could be threatened if it spreads
into the coal seam, officials said. Baden also said there was a
possibility of a brush fire.
   Bill Miska of the Office of Surface Mining in Columbus said if
his agency agrees there is an emergency, it will begin a cleanup. A
decision could be reached by Friday.

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas fired rockets at
Kabul during rush hour Wednesday and killed 13 people, disproving
claims that the rebels attack only military targets, Afghan media
reported.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said 34 people were wounded
in the Afghan capital.
   It blamed the attack on ``criminal extremists,'' a reference to
the U.S.-backed rebels who have been fighting the Soviet-backed
government in Kabul for 10 years.
   The broadcast criticized Western media for ``claiming that the
so-called Mujahedeen are attacking military installations only.''
Commanders of the Afghan guerrillas have said they attack only
military targets, not residential areas.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said 26 rockets
``exploded on the streets and squares of Kabul as its four
districts came under intensive shelling.''
   It quoted Afghanistan's official Bakhtar news agency as saying
16 shells hit Kabul suburbs and that the insurgents increased
pressure on the eastern city of Khost. It did not report casualties
in those attacks.
   The Soviet news agency said rebels are subjecting Khost ``to
nearly daily massive rocket and artillery shelling.''
   Tass also said Afghan government forces killed 23 rebels and
captured weapons in strikes at bases in Paktia, Balkh and Samangan
provinces.
   It reported continuing fighting among the rebels in Kuhestan,
Nejrab, Ghazni and Arghandab, and said about 50 insurgents were
killed.
   Radio Kabul said six people were killed in the eastern city of
Gardez in rocket attacks Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning.
Gardez is 60 miles southeast of Kabul.
   The Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda reiterated Soviet
complaints that Pakistan is to blame for violations of the U.N.
accord providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan.
   ``All indications are that in Islamabad, they have a very flawed
idea of international law, state-to-state relations and
treaty-based commitments,'' the newspaper said.
   The Soviet Union said last week it halted the withdrawal of its
troops from Afghanistan, citing violations of the accord.
   Pravda said the Afghan government has registered more than 1,500
violations with U.N. monitors.
   Radio Kabul charged that among the alleged violations, Pakistan
is circulating forged afghanis, the local currency, in Kabul. The
radio offered no details.
   Under the accord signed April 14, the Soviet Union agreed to
withdraw its 100,000 soldiers from Afghanistan in exchange for a
pledge of non-interference by Pakistan and other countries that
have been aiding the guerrillas. The guerrillas are not party to
the agreement.
   Half of the Soviet force in Afghanistan was withdrawn between
May 15 and Aug. 15, and the Soviet Union has until Feb. 15 to
complete the pullout.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979, replaced one
pro-Soviet government with another and remained to fight the
anti-Marxist insurgents.

<HEAD>Wright Tells Ethic Committee He Broke No Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright formally denied to
the ethics committee Wednesday that he broke House rules by talking
openly about a secret CIA operation aimed at undermining
Nicaragua's leftist government.
   Wright, in a letter to ethics chairman Rep. Julian Dixon, said
his Sept. 20 criticism of the CIA's purported secret efforts to
provoke civil disturbances in Nicaragua was based on publicly
available information.
   But the letter left several unanswered questions for the panel,
formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct,
to examine in its informal probe of the allegations against Wright.
   Dixon, D-Calif., called the investigation relatively simple,
particularly compared to the committee's separate and complex probe
into Wright's finances. ``It's not that complicated a matter,'' he
said.
   ``There are two basic elements: what classified information the
speaker may have received, and ... what he said to the press.''
   It is against House rules to publicly disclose classified
information given to the Intelligence Committee.
   On Tuesday, the Intelligence panel voted unanimously to grant
limited access to its files and personnel for the ethics probe _
access that could enable investigators to determine whether Wright
could have based his comments on material disclosed in classified
intelligence briefings.
   The controversy began when Wright told reporters, in answer to a
question, that ``we have received clear testimony from CIA people''
about the covert action, which he described as intended to scuttle
faltering peace talks between the Sandinistas and the Contra rebels.
   In a follow-up interview, the speaker said the spy agency had
not volunteered specific information about its secret activity, but
had acknowledged it only under questioning from members of
Congress. He later said he had been aware of the activity since
August 1987.
   But in his letter to Dixon, Wright said his reference to ``clear
testimony'' referred to 1985 testimony by ``CIA personnel'' before
the World Court.
   Wright did not name the personnel in the letter, but has
previously referred to testimony by David MacMichael, a former CIA
analyst, before the court in 1985. At the time MacMichael had been
dismissed by the CIA and was regarded as a renegade, according to
Intelligence Committee members.
   In Wednesday's letter, he also mentioned written testimony
forwarded to the World Court in 1985 by Edgar Chamorro, a former
Contra leader who left the rebel movement and became a vocal critic
of the CIA's handling of the rebels.
   Wright also said ``the CIA may never have formally
acknowledged'' an intent to provoke Sandinista overreaction and
arrests, as Wright charged in his comments to reporters, ``in any
of its testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, and it is
my impression that Congress has never authorized such activities.''
   The Intelligence Committee chairman, Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio,
said in a statement issued late Tuesday that ``the committee agreed
to respond to the request and to make its members and staff
available ... in connection with any information transmitted'' to
the ethics committee.
   Stokes termed the ethics committee's request for information
``very preliminary'' and added: ``They haven't even started a real
investigation yet.''
   The action appeared _ at least for the moment _ to satisfy
Republicans bent on adding a new layer to the ethics probe already
under way into Wright's financial dealings.
   ``Our concerns ... I think have been satisfied,'' said Rep. Dick
Cheney, R-Wyo., a member of the Intelligence panel.
   Wright has repeatedly defended his comments on several levels.
He has contended that the comments could have stemmed from publicly
available information, but also has said he has a moral obligation
to speak out about actions of the administration which he views as
wrong.

<TEXT>
   The army said Wednesday it will distribute gas
masks to about 37,000 Israelis following reports that Arab
countries may resort to chemical weapons in a war against the
Jewish state.
   The test program will be coupled with studies to try to
determine if the reported use of chemicals in the Persian Gulf war
has prompted Israelis to take the threat seriously, said an army
spokesman.
   The masks will be given to 3,000 residents of the town of
Shelomi on the Israeli-Lebanese border and to about 34,000 people
in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Hasharon, the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymtiy.
   No exact date has been set for the distribution, but the
spokesman said it would take place in the ``near future.''
   ``There could eventually be a decision to distribute the masks
nationwide,'' he said. ``But that would be real far off. This is
only a test case.''
   A 1988 Middle East Military Balance report from Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies said chemical
weapons are an ``integral part'' of military offensive strategies
in Arab countries.
   ``It appears ... that chemical weapons are an important element
in the ... concept of overall strategic parity with Israel,'' the
report said. ``(Chemical weapons) are quickly and easily
attainable.''
   The army spokesman said Ramat Hasharon and Shelomi were chosen
for the test because studies show them to be representative of the
general population.
   ``It's possible people have become more aware of the threat of
chemical weapons,'' he said. ``But without that awareness, it's
pretty useless to give them the masks.''
   In August, the army began equipping troops with newly developed
pills that increase immunity to chemical weapons.

<HEAD>North Korea Says South Fired At Guard Post In DMZ</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   North Korea accused South Korean troops Wednesday
of firing at one of the North's guard posts in the demilitarized
zone separating the countries.
   The North also accused the South of deliberately increasing
tensions after the Olympic Games.
   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said the ``grave
military provocation'' occurred in the eastern portion of the DMZ
at about 1:20 p.m.
   ``Today they fired several pinpoint shots at our side's post
from an artillery piece which they had carried into the DMZ by
stealth,'' said the English-language report monitored in Toyko.
   It said the alleged shooting threatened North Korean military
personnel and damaged facilities at the post.
   The news agency charged that the alleged attack ``vividly
proves'' that proposals by the South Korean government for dialogue
and detente between the countries were ``hypocrisy and deception.''
   On Tuesday, South Korean President Roh Tae-woo called for summit
talks with Kim Il Sung, leader of the communist North, and said he
was ready to cooperate to end tension between the two countries.
   ``Our people and People's Army soldiers are watching with
heightened vigilance the moves of the (South Korean government) in
deliberately rendering the situation strained as soon as the
Olympic Games ended,'' KCNA said.
   The North decided to boycott the Olympics, which ended on Oct. 2
in Seoul, after the International Olympic Committee turned down its
request to be a co-host.
   The Korean Peninsula was divided at the end of World War II.

   The age-old war against marauding grasshoppers
is being waged with some promising new biological weapons, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   In one development, two commercial firms _ Evans BioControl Inc.
of Broomfield, Colo., and Bozeman Bio Tech of Bozeman, Mont. _ have
adapted USDA technology for producing and storing a parasite,
Nosema lucustae. Department studies show the parasite kills 50
percent to 60 percent of grasshoppers in three to four weeks.
   The basic tests and development were done by the department's
Agricultural Research Service at the agency's Rangeland Insect
Laboratory in Bozeman by J.E. Henry and colleagues.
   Henry said the parasite is available to homeowners and ranchers
through regional agents and on contract to government agencies,
which use it on a large scale in the West. Grasshoppers cause an
estimated $400 million in damage to grass and crops each year, he
said.
   Spores of the parasite are put on wheat bran flakes to form a
bait. After the insects eat the bait, the organism ``attacks the
pest's fat cells and depletes its energy stores,'' Henry said in a
report issued here.
   The parasite remains in the grasshopper population because sick
females pass it on to offspring, and survivors eat dead relatives,
he said.
   Meanwhile, another development involves an agreement with Evans
Biotechnical to field test another natural killer, grasshopper
entomopoxvirus, the agency said. In laboratory tests, the virus
kills 20 percent to 30 percent of the grasshoppers right away and
stunts the growth of an additional 20 percent to 30 percent.
   Doug A. Streett, an entomoligist at the agency's Bozeman
laboratory, said Evans BioControl plans to produce the virus and
mix it with the parasite for tests on 1,000 acres in the West.
   Streett said that in combination the two ingredients may work
more rapidly to kill the grasshoppers.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Examines Affirmative Action Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday
that programs to reserve some public works contracts for minorities
cause reverse discrimination, while proponents said they break down
rigid racial barriers.
   The justices explored the power of state and local governments
to give preferential treatment to minority-owned businesses in a
key affirmative action case from Richmond, Va., to be decided by
July.
   At stake could be set-aside programs adopted by most states and
some 190 local governments.
   The Richmond plan was intended to fight racial discrimination,
``a scourge of our society,'' said John Payton, a lawyer
representing the city.
   Black participation in the construction trades had been ``close
to zero,'' he said. ``The evidence is stark and dramatic'' that
blacks were excluded systematically from entering and advancing in
the industry.
   ``Other remedies had no impact. They simply weren't working,''
he added.
   But Walter Ryland, representing building contractor J.A. Croson
Co., said setting aside part of the contracts for minorities is
reverse discrimination.
   ``If (city officials) wanted to attack societal discrimination,
they could do it by racially neutral means,'' he said.
   Croson successfully challenged the set-aside after the company
lost a city contract for failure to include a minority-owned
business as a subcontractor.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September 1987
there is insufficient evidence that city officials discriminated
against minority-owned businesses in the past and it said the
plan's quota appeared to be completely arbitrary.
   Richmond adopted the plan in 1983 to require that a prime
contractor on any city building project subcontract at least 30
percent of the value of the project to firms that are at least
one-half minority owned.
   While the minorities named in the plan include Hispanics,
Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts, the primary beneficiary
would be blacks _ who make up around half of Richmond's black
population.
   The Supreme Court has been closely divided on affirmative action
disputes, and Wednesday's hour-long argument session provided few
hints on the likely outcome of the Richmond case.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the court's newest member and
possibly the key to the outcome of the case, pressed the lawyers on
both sides to explain their positions.
   ``Is (the set-aside) the most narrowly tailored remedy'' for
racial bias, he asked? Kennedy suggested that the quota could mean
higher costs for city projects.
   Payton replied ``there is no real constitutional question''
posed by that possibility. ``Richmond can decide that is the cost
of remedying'' past discrimination.
   Kennedy, participating in his first affirmative action case
since joining the court last February, replaced Justice Lewis F.
Powell, who often cast the deciding vote on programs involving
preferential treatment for minorities.
   The Richmond case also may help foretell the court's future
approach to other forms of affirmative action and alleged reverse
discrimination. The justices in a recent string of decisions
generally have upheld preferential treatment for minorities and
women.
   Ryland challenged Richmond's motives in adopting the set-aside
policy. Noting that the city council had a black majority and that
the city's population is around 50 percent black, he said the plan
``could be just a pork-barrel thing.''
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that the court in
1980 upheld a similar 10 percent quota adopted by Congress for
federal building contracts.
   Congress also might adopt pork-barrel legislation, Rehnquist
said, ``but we give it a presumption of validity.''
   How Richmond selected a 30 percent quota is one of the issues at
the heart of the case.
   Ryland said the figure was ``pulled out of the air'' and was
``so high it can force a particularly serious impact on non-minorty
firms.''
   But Payton said 30 percent is a reasonable compromise in a city
that is half black and where historically minority-owned businesses
received less than 1 percent of the value of city contracts.
   Set-aside programs also have caused some deep divisions and
seemingly contradictory views within the Reagan administration.
   President Reagan, for example, said in 1984 he favored
channeling billions of additional contract dollars to
minority-owned firms. And the administration generally has looked
upon public works set-asides more sympathetically than other
affirmative action quotas it sternly opposes.
   But the Justice Department, responding to an invitation from the
Supreme Court in a case similar to the Richmond dispute, challenged
the constitutionality of set-asides.

<HEAD>President Signs Bill Relieving Tribes of Administrative Chores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Wednesday signed a bill
designed to ease administrative burdens on Indian tribes in
connection with a program to transfer some governmental powers from
Washington to the tribal governing bodies.
   The bill amends a law, enacted in 1975, that provides for tribes
to contract for health, housing, social and government services
that otherwise would be provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
   The new legislation responds to requests from tribes who said
the 1975 act imposed burdensome administrative requirements on them.
   Among other things, the bill exempts tribal construction
contracts from federal procurement rules and regulations and
provides that money not spent in one fiscal year can be carried
over to the next year.
   The bill also contains a provision saying the secretaries of the
interior and health and human services shall reduce funding to
Indian tribes if directed to do so by a member of Congress in a
statement accompanying a conference committee report.
   Reagan said this provision is unconstitutional because only the
two houses of Congress and the president can take actions altering
the legal duties of executive branch officers. However, he said,
the rest of the bill remains valid despite the unconstitutional
provision.

<HEAD>Teller's Memory for Scent Helps Bank Recover Missing Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank teller who mistakenly handed out $25,000
instead of $250 put police on the scent after realizing the
customer smelled like a certain Chinese restaurant, police said.
   The customer _ who turned out to be a busboy at the Three
Happiness Restaurant _ had been sent to Lakeside Bank on Tuesday to
get change for $500 _ half in coins and half in $1 bills.
   The teller grabbed $100 bills by mistake, put them in a counting
machine and sent the man off with $250 in coins plus $25,000 in
bills, said Sgt. John Roberts.
   When the mistake was discovered, the teller was unable to name
the person to whom she had given the windfall. But her nose gave
police the only lead they needed.
   ``The young lady who made the error recalled the individual who
came to get the change had a certain odor about him characteristic
of one of the restaurants in Chinatown,'' Roberts said.
   The teller picked the exact restaurant, telling police that the
aroma came from the cooking oils used there. Police recovered the
money from the unidentified busboy, who had hidden it at a
relative's home, police said.
   Authorities were prepared to charge the busboy under laws
governing theft of lost or mislaid property, but the bank declined
to prosecute to preserve good relations with customers in
Chinatown, Roberts said.
   Michael Moy, manager of the restaurant, said Wednesday that the
25-year-old busboy had been fired but that he was sympathetic
toward the young man, who undoubtedly considered his find ``lucky
money.''
   ``The mistake was from the bank, not from the boy,'' Moy said.
   After the teller discovered her error, she went to the
restaurant to speak to the busboy, but he denied any role, and
police were summoned, Roberts said.
   Jim Porcaro, a spokesman for the bank, said of the teller he
would not identify: ``It was an oversight that was corrected.''

<TEXT>
   Two polls released Wedneday found the
presidential contest narrowing sharply in Rhode Island, next to the
Massachusetts home of Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   A Brown University poll showed Dukakis and Republican George
Bush in a statistical dead heat in Rhode Island. A separate survey
for station WLNE-TV gave Dukakis a lead of 48 percent to 39 percent
over the vice president.
   The Brown survey of almost 400 likely voters found 40 percent
backing Dukakis and 36 percent supporting Bush. Because the
survey's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percent, the Dukakis
lead was statistically negligible.
   In June, a Brown poll found Dukakis with a 50 percent to 26
percent lead over Bush. The latest poll was conducted from Sept. 26
to Sept. 29, immediately after the candidates' first debate in
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   WLNE's poll was conducted from Sept. 29 to Oct. 1 and included
400 Rhode Island adults, not all of whom said they were likely to
vote. Its margin of error was 4.9 percent.

<HEAD>Two Sets Of Remains Recovered In Unprecedented Joint Search</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-Vietnamese teams retrieved two sets
of human remains in an unprecedented joint search of the
countryside for airmen missing in the Vietnam War, officials said
Wednesday.
   But U.S. investigators said one of the sets of remains, found at
Lang Son province bordering China, was found buried with the
remains of Vietnamese and probably is not American.
   Bill Bell, a U.S. team leader, said searchers found areas where
other remains might be buried and recovered pieces of aircraft
wreckage. They finished their eight-day search through five
provinces near Hanoi on Tuesday.
   The U.S. specialists left Wednesday for Bangkok, Thailand, but
planned to return to Hanoi on Friday to discuss their findings and
the possibility of more joint work, including excavations of crash
sites.
   The teams trekked through steep leech-infested mountains in
pouring monsoon rains to reach sites where six airmen were shot
down during the war, which ended in 1975. They interviewed
villagers who witnessed the crashes.
   Villagers led investigators to two sets of remains, in Lang Son
and Ha Nam Ninh provinces, said Nguyen Can, head of Vietnam's
Office For Seeking Missing Personnel.
   Can said the remains will be given to the United States after
preliminary analysis by Vietnamese forensic experts. He said
Vietnam does not have equipment for identifying the teeth, the key
part of both sets of remains.
   The six airmen were downed while on bombing missions from 1965
to 1967, Can said. U.S. officials said some of the airmen were
believed to have survived the crash but there was no evidence they
remain alive.
   ``In all the places, we talked to people who witnessed the
crashes, but none of them reported seeing any live airmen''
involved in the six cases, Bell said.
   Bell said villagers turned over pieces of wreckage when they
heard the Americans were searching the area. The teams used metal
detectors to locate areas where possible wreckage was covered over,
he said.
   U.S. bombers struck North Vietnam beginning in March 1965 and
over the next four years dropped more than 605,000 tons of bombs.
   The joint project was a breakthrough because it was the first
time Vietnam allowed U.S. experts to probe the countryside and
because it may resolve some cases Washington considers top priority
among the 1,757 missing in Vietnam.
   The six airmen are among 70 ``discrepancy cases'' that the
United States says Vietnamese authorities should have information
on. Such cases include airmen the communists captured but never
returned after U.S. forces withdrew from Vietnam in 1973.
   Vietnam's Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said Tuesday that
Hanoi agreed in principle to many more joint investigations over
the next two months.
   The two countries agreed on the joint work in June, but Vietnam
suspended cooperation after criticizing Washington for refusing to
take the first steps to establish diplomatic relations.
   Vietnam previously allowed only one joint field project, the
excavation of a B-52 bomber outside Hanoi in late 1985.
   Can said the Americans paid all costs of the latest joint
investigation and provided a computer and vehicles to help in the
operation.

   Republican George Bush has given up some of the
ground he had gained in his Democratic rival's home state of
Massachusetts, according to a presidential poll published Wednesday.
   The survey, conducted over three days by KRC Research of
Cambridge for the Boston Herald and WBZ-TV, gave Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis a 43 percent to 39 percent
lead over the vice president, still within the poll's 5 percent
margin of error. The poll of likely voters also showed 18 percent
undecided.
   A Sept. 1 poll published by the Herald showed Bush and Dukakis
in a 42-42 percent tie. A July poll had Dukakis with a 14 percent
lead.
   According to the Herald, a poll conducted for WBZ-TV last month
had Dukakis ahead 45-40. A Boston Globe poll published last week
showed Dukakis with a 48-40 edge.

<HEAD>White House Denies Reagan Signed Order Authorizing Assassinations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House denied Wednesday that
intelligence authorizations signed by President Reagan in the
mid-1980s gave CIA agents latitude to use assassinations in the
fight against terrorism.
   But chief spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged that language
in two intelligence findings in 1984 and 1985 subsequently was
rescinded by the National Security Council, though he wouldn't say
why.
   Reagan's spokesman took strong exception to a Washington Post
report Wednesday which said phrasing in the earlier documents
amounted to a ``license to kill'' for intelligence agents.
   Fitzwater suggested that the Post story was an attempt to
embarrass the administration during the election campaign. But he
stopped short of saying precisely that, telling reporters to ``make
your own judgment.''
   ``I think this is an extraordinary cheap shot. It's not true,''
he said.
   Fitzwater's harsh statements at the daily White House news
briefing mirrored comments he made Sept. 28, 1987 on a book by Bob
Woodward, assistant managing editor of The Post for investigative
reporting, entitled ``VEIL: The Secret Wars of the CIA.''
   The book among other things described intelligence findings
signed by Reagan in 1984 and 1985 which contained language
interpreted by some in the administration as providing a means for
U.S. spies to make an end run around a 1981 Reagan executive order
flatly prohibiting assassinations.
   On September 1987, Fitzwater, responding to the revelations in
Woodward's book, said Reagan ``was never aware of ... never
authorized ... any assassination efforts.''
   On Wednesday, he said, ``This an old story being rehashed again,
interestingly timed, but has no foundation.'' Woodward was a
co-author of the story that appeared in Wednesday's editions of The
Post.
   The authorizations ``deemed'' as lawful any covert actions _
including potentially violent ones _ taken in ``good faith'' by
U.S. intelligence agents against terrorists, according to the
report.
   Fitzwater denied that the intelligence findings could have been
construed as sanctioning assassination in attempts to combat
worldwide terrorism.
   ``I'm not going to give you a specific definition ... (of the
phrasing in question) because I don't know and ... because we
wouldn't discuss it anyway,'' he said. ``But the purpose was to
authorize counterintelligence activities to counter terrorism.''
   ``The point is they did not authorize assassinations, period,''
Fitzwater added. ``Because there's an executive order in effect
that said they didn't. Because the president said they didn't.''
   ``It was rescinded when a new terrorism finding was made in May
of 1986. It was omitted, but I don't know why. And then when they
(intelligence findings) were all reviewed again in May of '87, it
was firmly and specifically omitted.''
   The Post story said Reagan signed intelligence authorizations in
both 1984 and 1985 giving CIA agents broad anti-terrorism powers.
   It reported that unidentified White House officials said Vice
President George Bush would have been given a copy of or would have
had access to the findings.
   Bush also denied the report Wednesday, saying, ``If we weren't
in polite company, I'd tell you what I thought about a report like
that.'' Asked during an appearance in Littleton, Colo., if it were
true, Bush said ``Absolutely not. To circumvent the law against
assassinations is absolutely criminal.''
   Reagan signed the first finding on Nov. 13, 1984, shortly after
his landslide re-election victory, the Post report said, because
U.S. officials had become frustrated with car-bombings at U.S.
facilities and the taking of American hostages.
   Congressional intelligence committees were not informed of the
crucial language in the findings, the report said. Fitzwater denied
that Wednesday, saying there had been notification.
   The authorization was rescinded on April 10, 1985, a month after
a car bomb exploded, killing 80 people in Beirut near the residence
of a leader of one faction of Iranian fundamentalists.
   The second authorization which included similar language was
signed by Reagan on Aug. 11, 1985, two months after the highjacking
of TWA Flight 847 in which American Navy diver Robert Stethem was
killed. The intelligence panels were briefed after the signing of
the second finding, the Post said.

<HEAD>Environment Group Sues Government to Halt CFC Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental group said Wednesday it had
sued the Environmental Protection Agency seeking to force it to
order a complete end to the use of chemicals that destroy the
earth's protective ozone layer.
   The suit by the Natural Resources Defense Council challenges the
adequacy of the partial cutbacks that EPA ordered for five major
chlorofluorocarbon compounds, or CFC's, on Aug. 1.
   Those regulations paralled provisions of the 1987 treaty by
major producing nations pledging themselves to a 50 percent
reduction in CFC output by 1998.
   EPA Administrator Lee M. Thomas last week said new analyses show
that the 50 percent cut will not protect the ozone layer high in
the stratosphere and the chemicals in question should be phased out.
   The ozone layer reduces the amount of cancer-causing ultraviolet
rays from the sun that reach the earth's surface. The CFC
compounds, normally inert, rise through the atmosphere to the ozone
layer, where those same ultraviolet rays break them apart and free
chlorine to destroy the ozone.
   CFC's are used as refrigeration fluids, solvents and plastic
foam blowing agents. Many countries still permit their use as
aerosol propellants, a use banned in the United States in 1978.
   ``The United States is the single largest contributor to
world-wide emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals,'' responsible
for about 30 percent of global use, said David Doniger, an attorney
for the council. ``We have a responsibility to clean up our own
house.''
   Doniger argued that the United States ``leads best when it leads
by example.'' He said the EPA could pressure other countries to
follow suit by banning imports of products made with CFC's unless
the importing country also was committed to ending CFC use.
   He said EPA's refusal to go beyond the treaty in its regulations
``appears to reflect a deal struck within the administration last
summer'' to placate a faction that believed no treaty was necessary.
   EPA spokesman Dave Cohen said Doniger's ``notion of a deal is
untrue and silly.''
   ``Our goal all along has been to get the nations of the world to
the table and agree to the deepest reductions we could possibly
get,'' Cohen said.
   ``We feel only a global solution will truly help the ozone
layer,'' and unilateral U.S. action could be counterproductive by
leading other nations to conclude they could safely increase their
use of CFC's as a result, Cohen said.
   The suit was filed in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Stipe Suvar
called for a shake-up in the ruling Politburo and the
policy-setting Central Committee after weeks of ethnic and economic
protests, state-run media said Wednesday.
   About 5,000 workers marched on Parliament on Wednesday for the
second straight day. Workers have stepped up strikes and
demonstrations over the communist government's failure to reduce
217 percent inflation and unemployment, which is at 15 percent.
   Radio Belgrade said 140,000 Serbs attended two rallies in
central Serbia to push demands for greater Serbian control over the
autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs.
   Thousands more flag-waving Serbs attended a similar rally in
Novi Sad, 42 miles north of the capital, according to Radio
Belgrade and the state-run Tanjug news agency. Crowd estimates
ranged from 30,000 to 80,000.
   Suvar said Tuesday night that the 162-member Central Committee
probably will vote on personnel changes in the Politburo on Oct. 17
in a session expected to be a major showdown between factions in
the party leadership. State newspapers reported his comments
Wednesday.
   He said the Politburo will meet before Oct. 17 ``to determine
the criteria of possible responsibility of its members'' for the
country's worst economic and political crisis since World War II.
   ``If it fails in this, the Central Committee will assume this
role, and anyone who does not win two-thirds of the committee's
votes will have to leave the presidium (Politburo),'' he said.
   As the top body of Yugoslavia's only political party, the
Politburo is the most powerful institution in the country. It has
23 members, but two resigned last week under mounting criticism.
   Suvar also said about one-third of the Central Committee
membership will be changed by the end of the autumn.
   ``Very soon new people will be brought into the Central
Committee of the League of Communists and its presidium,'' Suvar
said.
   Suvar announced that a similar ``cadre renewal'' was expected in
the party leaderships of Yugoslavia's six republics and two
autonomous provinces.
   Yugoslavs have become increasingly vocal in demanding top-level
personnel changes. Leaders have been blamed for failing to defuse
tensions between the mostly Christian Serbian minority and the
largely Moslem Albanian majority in Kosovo.
   In addition to high inflation and double-digit unemployment, the
country has a $21 billion foreign debt.
   Yugoslav and foreign observers believe major personnel changes
at the Oct. 17 meeting will be aimed at reducing tensions between
different factions within the party.
   Senior leaders who have been denounced in public and are widely
expected to be sacked during or before the meeting include Stane
Dolanc, the nation's vice president from Slovenia; Josip Vrhovec, a
Croatian member in the collective presidency; and several officials
from the autonomous provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo.
   Among those who expect to emerge victorious from the meeting are
hard-line Serbian officials and their supporters, led by the
Serbian republic's party boss, Slobodan Milosevic.
   Milosevic, riding a wave of popularity in the largest republic,
advocates more central control over the provinces.
   On Wednesday, for the second straight day, Milosevic addressed a
crowd of angry workers at Parliament and promised reforms.
   About 5,000 workers booed two other Communist leaders outside
Parliament on Tuesday.
   During the TV interview, Suvar rejected suggestions that the
introduction of a multiparty system in this single-party state
would resolve the crisis.
   He said that a type of a multiparty system already exists
because each of the republics and autonomous provinces has its own
communist party, but that the system does not work.

   A 3-year-old girl who tumbled into a
sewer opening survived by holding on to a pipe and bobbing for 45
minutes in 10-foot-deep water until rescue crews arrived,
authorities said.
   Elizabeth Marie Tong apparently fell into the 18-foot-deep
opening while playing with a friend at a construction site near her
home Tuesday evening.
   A woman who had been horseback riding in the area discovered the
child. ``She was a real trooper,'' said Elizabeth Winstead, who
called for help and talked to the girl to keep her calm.
   The young girl complained of being cold, but appeared to be
uninjured in the fall, said fire rescue spokesman Wayne Doolittle.
   The opening was about 4 to 5 feet in diameter. To keep her head
above water, the child, who fell in at about 7 p.m., wrapped her
arms around a 10-inch diameter pipe, Ms. Winstead said.
   ``I told her to hang on,'' she said, adding, ``I didn't know the
water was that deep.''
   Rescue crews lowered a ladder into the opening and climbed down
to get her.
   ``She was very lucky. She could have easily drowned,'' Doolittle
said Wednesday.
   The child was examined at Baptist Medical Center and released to
her parents. ``She's doing fantastic. She looks really good,'' said
Dr. John Stimler.
   Normally, Public Safety Director John Keane said, sewage station
openings are locked to prevent such accidents.
   ``We don't know why that lift station was not locked,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Gulps Pills At Foreclosure Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman gulped pills in an apparent
suicide attempt during a break in a foreclosure proceeding where
she risked losing a dairy farm that has been in the family for at
least four generations, authorities said.
   ``Just about everything bad that could happen to people happened
to these people,'' attorney Ned Nakles Jr. said Wednesday of Ida A.
Depta and her family. ``The woman got caught up in such a feeling
of hopelessness.''
   Mrs. Depta, 48, of Alverton took the prescription pills from two
bottles in front of other people in a courthouse hallway Tuesday
afternoon.
   ``That tells me she wasn't so much trying to kill herself as she
was asking for help,'' said Nakles, who represents the estate of
Mrs. Depta's late mother, Irene Bowser.
   Mrs. Depta remained in Westmoreland Hospital. Officials withheld
her condition and other details at the family's request.
   Nakles said he did not know what kind of pills she swallowed.
   The incident occurred in the Westmoreland County Courthouse,
where negotiations were under way to settle an attempt by ITT
Financial Service to foreclose on the family's 100-acre dairy farm
in southwestern Pennsylvania.
   The lender sued in 1985, claiming Mrs. Bowser and the Deptas
defaulted on a $111,000 loan secured by the farm's 1984 estimated
market value of $220,000. Mrs. Bowser, who died in August, had
diabetes and was nearly blind, Nakles said.
   Mrs. Depta ``stated to us that all she wants is to join her mom
at the cemetery,'' said Deputy Sheriff Eric Sinclair. ``She's just
upset over her mom, her brother is dying of cancer, and the
possible loss of the farm.''
   Witnesses said the Deptas' 18-year-old daughter was able to pull
some of the pills from her mother's mouth.
   Misfortunes at the farm caused some of the Deptas' money
problems.
   Eighteen dairy cows died of an udder disease, and the Deptas
were forced to have water hauled to their cattle after the farm's
well was fouled around the time a gas well was drilled nearby,
Nakles said.
   In addition, Mrs. Depta's husband, Joseph, was unable to work
because of neck, back, shoulder and leg injuries from an auto
accident in 1984, according to court documents. Depta also was
treated for depression that year.

<HEAD>Report Says Doctors Can Do More To Help Incontinence Sufferers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten million Americans suffer from urinary
incontinence and most could be helped if doctors would apply proven
treatments in more cases, a National Institutes of Health committee
concluded Wednesday.
   ``We're not talking about rocket science here,'' said Dr. John
W. Rowe, chairman of the 15-member consensus development panel.
``This is something we can do tomorrow.''
   The committee report calls for family physicians to pay more
attention to incontinence problems in their elderly patients and
educate themselves about threatment. It also urges patients to be
more assertive in expecting adequate treatment if they are
incontinent.
   And it called for more research into the causes of incontinence,
a field the experts said has largely been overlooked in the quest
for answers to more exotic medical ailments.
   Their fundamental point, however, was that the existing
treatments often do not get to the people who need them because of
a widespread and erroneous belief, even by many doctors, that
incontinence is a natural consequence of aging.
   ``This is an issue we can no longer neglect,'' Rowe said at a
news conference wrapping up the panel's three-day meeting. ``Most
cases can be cured or improved.''
   He said more than half of those suffering from the problem are
not even evaluated, let alone treated.
   Rowe, a professor from The Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New
York City, offered this hypothetical remark from doctor to
incontinent patient as all too familiar: ``Well, what do you
expect, my dear. After all, you are 82.''
   He said the patient should reply: ``I expect to get responsible,
adequate medical care.''
   One specific recommendation was for legislation requiring the
manufacturers of adult diapers to carry a label message emphasizing
that most incontinence is treatable and that anyone suffering from
it should get a full medical evaluation.
   ``Many people with incontinence turn prematurely to the use of
absorbent materials without having their difficult properly
diagnosed and treated,'' the report said.
   There are several treatments for the various causes of
incontinence, which is defined in the report as ``a symptom rather
than a disease.''
   The condition can be treated with drugs, surgery or behavioral
techniques, which include exercises and biofeedback.

<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democrat Lloyd Bentsen said he was ``feeling
great'' and ready for his prime-time showdown Wednesday night with
Republican Dan Quayle.
   The Texas senator, preparing for the most important night of his
vice presidential campaign, appeared relaxed as he headed to the
Omaha Civic Auditorium for a lighting and microphone check a few
hours before the 90-minute debate with his GOP counterpart.
   What would he try to accomplish in the debate? he was asked.
``Win,'' he replied.
   Bentsen spoke by telephone with Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis in Boston. ``We had a good visit,'' Bentsen said, adding
that Dukakis' advice was to ``just be myself.''
   Dukakis and Bentsen planned a reunion Thursday at a steel plant
rally near Longview, Texas.
   Bentsen arrived in Omaha on Tuesday night after four days of
intense preparations, first in Washington and then in Austin,
Texas. He took time to spend with his wife and three children and
planned to work out in the hotel gym to help him relax before the
debate.
   B.A. Bentsen accompanied her husband to the private tour of the
debate site Wednesday afternoon. Afterward, according to press
secretary Mike McCurry, Bentsen, 67, picked up his wife and carried
her off the stage. ``She looked like she was willing to go with him
anywhere,'' he said.
   Much of his preparation was devoted to making Bentsen
comfortable with the format of the debate, which limited the
candidates to two-minute answers and one-minute responses, aides
said.
   ``It's a matter of taking the language of the U.S. Senate and
putting it in a form that's suitable for television,'' McCurry said.
   Although his advisers admitted helping Bentsen ``frame his
answers,'' McCurry said, ``we have not armed him with a lot of cute
one-liners. That's not really his style.''
   ``I think we'll leave the one-liners to Roger Ailes and Dan
Quayle,'' said Dukakis aide Leslie Dach, referring to the
Republican media strategist who has been coaching the GOP candidate.
   Bentsen and other Democrats have tried to exploit public
uneasiness about Quayle's qualifications for the job, and public
polls show Quayle is a drag on the Republican ticket. A strong
performance by the 41-year-old Quayle could turn that around.
   ``I don't think people are going to judge this just by the fact
he doesn't stumble,'' Dach said. He said Quayle needed ``an
extremely strong performance'' to overcome the public's doubts.

<TEXT>
   The Central Elections Committee decided
Wednesday that Rabbi Meir Kahane's anti-Arab Kach Party is racist
and cannot run in the Nov. 1 parliamentary elections. The party
said it would appeal to the Supreme Court.
   The committee acted after the rival Labor and Likud parties
joined in condemning the American-born rabbi's party as racist and
anti-democratic. The committee is made up of members of the
Knesset, Israel's parliament, in proportion to each party's
representation.
   In another development, Attorney General Yosef Harish said there
was insufficient evidence for him to investigate charges that Labor
bugged Likud headquarters, Israel radio reported.
   Kach member Rahamim Cohen, who defended his party before the
committee, said: ``This was a political lynching. I personally feel
the Supreme Court will cancel this decision.''
   Israel's Supreme Court has upheld disqualification of a
political party only once, in 1965 when it ruled against a party
called Socialist List whose members allegedly belonged to an
outlawed group pledged to destruction of Israel.
   In 1984, it overruled an Elections Committee decision to
disqualify Kach, which had won a Knesset seat, occupied by Kahane,
in the 1984 election.
   After that committee decision, the Knesset passed a law barring
racist parties from running for office.
   The Kach platform calls for expulsion of the 2.2 million Arabs
living in Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Committee members voted 28-5, with three abstentions, to ban
Kach. The opposition came from three small religious parties.
   Kahane, born in Brooklyn, N.Y., established the Jewish Defense
League in the United States before moving to Israel and founding
Kach, which means ``Thus'' in Hebrew.
   His party's popularity has grown because of anti-Arab sentiment
fed by the 10-month-old Palestinian revolt in the occupied lands.
Recent polls indicated it could win up to three of the 120 Knesset
seats Nov. 1.
   Dan Meridor of Likud said of the election committee vote: ``This
was a difficult decision. We are depriving (the party) of a
fundamental right.''
   Many references were made to the Jews' own past as a persecuted
people during the committee debate, which lasted nearly four hours.
   ``Now that the Jewish people have become the majority, will they
treat people as did other nations which lost all semblance of
humanity?'' asked Chaim Ramon of Labor. ``The Nazis started the
same way with the same phrases.''
   Cohen denied Kach ideology was racist.
   ``Our attitudes toward the Arab population do not stem from
racist motives but from security considerations, because the Arab
population is a hostile population. Orthodox Jewish law obligates
every Jew to keep himself apart from the gentiles and not to
assimilate.''
   Kahane says his party platform is based on Orthodox law.

   A minor fuel explosion damaged one of the

   The explosion occurred Tuesday in a hangar at the Marine base
here while a soldier tested a newly replaced fuel pump, Gunnery
Sgt. Dean Chamberlain said.
   Sgt. Adam W. Shelburg suffered a broken leg, Chamberlain said.
   The explosion caused a small fire that was extinguished before
it could spread to the other helicopter in the hangar, Chamberlain
said.
   The military and engineers from Sikorsky, the helicopter
manufacturer, will investigate.
   Chamberlain said the base uses several helicopters to transport
the president and does not anticipate any reduction of service
because of the explosion.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay and
his defeated rival for the Democratic Senate nomination joined
forces Wednesday against the Republican nominee after their
bruising primary battle.
   MacKay, who won Tuesday's runoff against Insurance Commissioner
Bill Gunter, said he didn't think the divisive primary would harm
the Democrats' chances in November to claim the seat being vacated
by Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   MacKay faces U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, the grandson of the Hall of
Fame baseball manager of the same name, in the Nov. 8 general
election. Chiles is retiring after three terms.
   ``We're not going to lose this election because our party's
divided,'' MacKay, a three-term congressman, said after his 52
percent to 48 percent victory over Gunter.
   ``Though our experience had its pitfalls, had its ups and downs
and there was some pain, it was a much better exercise in the
Democratic process than the performance of `Cardboard Connie,'''
Gunter said at a news conference before attaching a MacKay sticker
to his suit.
   ``I'm proud to support him (MacKay) and will do all that I can
to ensure his election,'' he added.
   Mack said he knew the Democrats would nominate the most liberal
candidate. He adopted the tactic of GOP presidential nominee George
Bush in painting Democrats as liberals outside the mainstream.
   ``I am conservative. I am proud of being conservative,'' Mack
said during a stop in Tallahassee. ``The state of Florida is
conservative. I believe the things that I have talked about in the
past year are in the mainstream, and that's what the debate is
about.''
   Even before the runoff Tuesday, Mack ran commercials going after
MacKay, saying: ``Hey Buddy, You're Liberal!''
   MacKay cited Mack's support of former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North, who has campaigned for Mack, as an example of extremism. He
also brought up a zero rating assigned to Mack by the National
Council on Senior Citizens, who represent an important segment of
Florida's population, and environmentalists' criticism of Mack.
   ``I'm in the mainstream,'' MacKay said. ``He's in the extreme.''

<HEAD>Senate Paves Way for Approval of International Copyright Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 89-0 approval Wednesday of
legislation paving the way for the United States to join a
century-old agreement among 76 nations that grants global
copyrights to literary and artistic works.
   ``Adherence to the convention will greatly benefit the United
States,'' said Sen. Pat Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on patents, copyrights and
trademarks. ``It will provide the guidelines which govern the
copyright regulations between nations.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, ranking Republican on the panel,
agreed. ``Our participation will provide benefits to American
copyright holders and artists.''
   The bill would change U.S. copyright law, paving the way for
Senate consent to ratification of the treaty, signed in Berne,
Switzerland, on Sept. 9, 1886. Ratification will come on a separate
vote.
   The Berne Convention, which has been signed by 76 nations,
spells out minimum copyright standards, detailing what is protected
and how long the protection lasts.
   The pact prohibits member nations from discriminating against
copyrighted works of other member nations. It also provides for
copyright protection to take effect in other countries
automatically without the necessity of government formalities, such
as providing official notice of a copyright.
   The chief dispute over the legislation involved how best to
protect what are known as ``moral rights'' _ the authority of a
writer or artist to guard the integrity of his work against what he
thinks are damaging changes or misuse.
   Artists have generally argued for stiff coverage in U.S. law of
moral rights. Critics have said that strong coverage is
unnecessary, although they support the idea of protecting the
artistic integrity of works.
   American copyright law doesn't cover moral rights. The Berne
Convention requires signing nations to protect in law the right of
an artist to ensure the integrity of his work. However, that
protection doesn't have to be part of copyright law.
   The bill approved Wednesday sidesteps that issue, providing that
neither the measure nor adherence to the Berne Convention expands
or contracts a copyright holder's rights to object to any change in
a protected work.

<HEAD>Lawyer Questions Constitutionality of New Sentencing System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer urged the Supreme Court on Wednesday
to strike down a new sentencing system for people convicted of
federal crimes, saying, ``Judges are supposed to stay out of
political controversies.''
   Washington lawyer Alan Morrison attacked federal sentencing
rules that took effect last Nov. 1 because the seven-member
commission that issued them included three federal judges.
   Judges participating in a political process ``that could fairly
be called horse-trading'' is unconstitutional because it impugns
the federal judiciary's neutrality and impartiality, Morrison
argued.
   The job of passing laws about sentences for federal crimes
belongs to Congress and not to judges, Morrison said.
   But Solicitor General Charles Fried, the government's top
courtroom lawyer, called the U.S. Sentencing Commission's work a
constitutionally acceptable attempt to resolve ``grave, invidious
and inexplicable disparities in the sentencing process.''
   At issue is the validity of the commission, created by Congress,
and the validity of the sentencing rules it issued.
   More than 90 federal trial judges have refused to use the new
sentencing rules, declaring them and the commission
unconstitutional. But at least 60 of their colleagues have upheld
the system, imposing sentences under the new rules.
   By the time the justices announce their decision, expected by
July, thousands of defendants will be subject to resentencing _
regardless of which way the court rules.
   If the justices uphold the system, those defendants sentenced by
judges who refused to apply the new rules will have to be
resentenced. If the justices invalidate the system, those
defendants sentenced under the new rules will have to be
resentenced.
   The commission estimated that by Jan. 1, more than 10,000
federal court defendants will have been subjected to the new
sentencing system.
   Congress created the commission in the Sentencing Reform Act of
1984, legislation aimed at eliminating what some called unjustified
disparities in sentences.
   The law empowers the commission _ with its members appointed to
six-year terms by the president _ to tell federal judges what
sentences should be imposed for various crimes.
   The rules generally stiffened the prison time federal convicts
were required to serve. They also eliminated parole and curtailed
credit for good behavior.
   Morrison, representing a man who pleaded guilty in federal court
to conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine, argued that ``the
laying down of broad rules causes (the three commission member)
judges to be embroiled in political controversy.''
   ``Judges appointed for life must maintain their neutrality and
impartiality,'' Morris said.
   Fried acknowledged that having judges serve on the commission
raises certain ``policy concerns,'' but said those concerns ``have
no grounding as constitutional prohibitions.''
   Several members of the court, most persistently Justices Anthony
M. Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, asked Fried questions that appeared
to challenge his assertion of the commission's constitutionality.
   Representing the commission, Chicago lawyer Paul Bator said the
constitutionally required separation of the political branches does
not bar Congress from establishing an independent agency to make
laws about sentencing.
   He said Congress could give the Supreme Court the same authority
over federal sentencing without any constitutional violation.
   The test case before the justices stems from the prosecution of
John M. Mistretta, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess and
distribute cocaine after his arrest last year in Kansas City.
   Before Mistretta's sentence was imposed, he challenged the new
sentencing rules. A trial judge dismissed the challenge and
sentenced Mistretta to 18 months in prison, to be followed by a
three-year term of supervised release.
   Mistretta then appealed to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, but the Supreme Court granted Fried's request that it
decide the constitutional issue while the case is pending before
the appeals court.
   The case is U.S. vs. Mistretta, 87-1904.

   A man charged with taking more than 110
students and teachers hostage at a school Feb. 2 questioned jurors
himself as his trial on 110 counts of kidnapping opened under
extraordinary security.
   James L. Harvey, 43, of Tuscaloosa, served as his own attorney
during jury selection. A pool of 65 potential jurors awaited
questioning.
   Those entering the courtroom had to pass through metal
detectors, and Madison County Chief Deputy Sheriff Charlie Norment
said 17 deputies were on hand to protect the 104 schoolchildren
subpoenaed as witnesses by Harvey.
   Dressed in a light blue suit with a dark blue tie, Harvey
brought his legal papers into the courtroom in a brown grocery sack
Wednesday. He laid a red-covered Bible on the defense table, where
he sat by himself.
   He won the right to represent himself on Monday after promising
not to disrupt the trial.
   Harvey is accused in a 12-hour takeover of the private West End
Christian School in Tuscaloosa.
   Armed with two pistols and a rifle and wearing ski masks, Harvey
and another man entered the school and held 110 students and
teachers hostage, saying he was trying to draw attention to the
nation's homeless and hungry.
   No one was injured. The standoff ended with Harvey surrendering
after viewing a bogus pardon videotaped by Gov. Guy Hunt.
   Harvey has been held on $8.4 million bail. If convicted, he
could be sentenced to more than 10,000 years in prison. Charges
were later dropped against the other man, who police said was
forced to participate.
   Judge John M. Karrh ordered the trial moved to Huntsville about
160 miles away because of publicity.
   Harvey asked prospective jurors whether they knew anyone
connected with what he called ``the incident,'' whether they
believed in the presumption of innocence for a defendant, whether
they had any relatives in law enforcement and whether they believed
in statute law vs. ``the constitutional law _ the moral law that we
live under in a society.''
   District Attorney Charles Freeman asked prospective jurors
whether they would automatically consider someone insane ``just
because he committed an illogical crime.'' None said they would.
   The prosecution subpoenaed no children, instead summoning
officers, reporters, the school's headmaster and teachers. Hunt,
who was subpoenaed by Harvey, will testify Friday.
   A Hunt spokeswoman, Stacy Rimer, said the governor made it plain
to Harvey the day of the takeover that he had no power to grant a
pardon.
   ``He always felt he did what was right because the lives of all
those students and teachers were at stake,'' she said.

   A sheriff's deputy answering the alarm discovered the curious
family sitting on a desk among the literary reference books,
somewhere between Greek and Latin authors and the ``Critical Survey
of Long Fiction.''
   ``They seem to prefer history and the reference department,''
said circulation manager Carol Rouse. ``They read a better class of
literature than the average person.''
   The animals apparently had been nesting in the library for some
time before breaking through the ceiling tiles.
   On Tuesday night, animal control officials put a ladder covered
with burlap up to the hole in the ceiling to entice the mother, in
part because they believed she might have other babies still in the
roof.
   The strategy worked, and on Wednesday the library was open again
with the presumably well-informed raccoons roaming above the
ceiling, Ms. Rouse said.

<HEAD>Germ Mail Ban Draws Opposition</HEAD>

   A proposal to ban the mailing of germs and
dangerous toxins has drown vigorous opposition, Assistant
Postmaster General Frank R. Heselton said Wednesday.
   As a result, final action on the ban has been postponed until
the issue can be more fully studied, Heselton reported to a House
Post Office and Civil Service subcommittee.
   And, Heselton said, the Postal Service has contacted the federal
Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Transportation
for assistance in developing safety standards for hazardous mail.
   Of 508 comments received after the proposed rule was made
public, only seven favored the ban, Heselton said. Opposition, for
various reasons, came from doctors, laboratories, colleges and
universities, medical centers, pathologists and biologists and
state and federal health groups, among others, he said.
   The plan to exclude germs and toxins from the mail was announced
in June in the wake of reports that the military had increased
shipments of such items.
   The action was taken ``to ensure the safety and health of ...
customers and employees,'' the Postal Service said in announcing
the decision. ``The Postal Service is concerned that some customers
are planning increased use of the mails for sending disease germs
or hazardous toxins (etiologic agents).''
   Opponents of the restriction contended that there is no record
of anyone ever being infected by handling mailed germs or toxins,
however.
   They said the ban would increase the costs of shipping medical
materials for testing purposes, possibly slow down such testing and
might lead mailers to improperly package and misidentify such items
in order to mail them.
   The Postal Service does not want to increase medical costs or
have a negative impact on medical diagnosis or research, Heselton
said, but it must also be able to protect both its employees and
the public.
   ``It may be possible to reduce the risk by reducing the quantity
permitted for medical purposes per parcel, and requiring better
packaging and more expeditious means of movement in the mail,'' he
said.
   Postal workers in Kansas City last year expressed concern about
blood and other medical samples mailed to a laboratory there for
testing, when some packages were found leaking. Mail handlers were
supplied with gloves, masks and other protective gear at the time,
and the packaging for the samples has since been improved.
   Postal regulations already prohibit the mailing of a variety of
items, including strike-anywhere matches, explosives, fuses, many
poisons, most flammable liquids and certain chemicals.
   Many other items, such as corrosives, compressed gases,
herbicides, pesticides and certain other poisons, can be mailed
only in certain types of packages and in specific quantities.

<TEXT>
   This town's casket race is such a
``monumental'' effort, Chuck Darling says, that it took five years
to put together a second one.
   Now, the caskets and contestants are ready for the race Saturday
over a 75-yard obstacle course, said the president of the Rotary
Club in this town of 2,000, about 250 of whom work at Goodwater's
three casket manufacturers.
   Darling said each casket will contain one ``live corpse'' borne
by six pallbearers who will have to run around two tombstones,
through a pit called a grave, over sawdust called grave dust and
through cross ties and auto tires.
   The person in each casket will carry a cup of water in a two-cup
measuring container. If an ounce or more is spilled, the team is
disqualified.
   Two first-place prizes are $140 and a trophy shaped like a
casket. If the two of the 20 or so teams finish in a ``dead heat,''
the prize will be shared.
   Goodwater's casket manufacturers will provide their wares for
the race.
   ``They are major industries and we want to show appreciation to
them,'' said Darling, a pharmacist. As was done before the first
race, in 1983, a casket promoting the event is on display at a
service station in the heart of town.
   ``We hold our fall festival every year, but the casket race is
such a `monumental' effort for so many people we couldn't `handle'
it every year,'' Darling said.
   He said the town's casket business ``is pretty much booming.
People are dying to get one.''

   Legislation to force the recall of lead-lined
water coolers and to ban the manufacture of coolers that are not
lead-free was passed Wednesday by the House and sent to the Senate.
   The bill, approved on a voice vote, would give the Consumer
Product Safety Commission a year to require manufacturers and
importers of lead-lined coolers to either repair, replace or give
refunds on such coolers.
   The proposal would authorize spending $90 million through 1992
for a grant program to assist schools to test for lead
contamination and replace drinking water plumbing containing lead.
   The bill also would authorize a three-year, $66 million program
of technical and grant assistance to detect and prevent lead
poisoning of children, who are more susceptible to poisoning than
adults.

   A 16-year-old shot and killed his parents

   ``This is a tragedy we wish would have never happened,'' said
Walker County Sheriff Jack Trotter. ``These folks were good people
and well thought of in the community. The people over there feel

   The teen-ager, whose name was not disclosed because of his age,
was arrested Tuesday and jailed without bail on arson and murder
charges in the slayings Monday of Louis Albert Best, 47, and
Phyllis Jane Chaney Best, 40.
   The bodies were discovered in the couple's burned-out trailer.
Mrs. Best was shot in the neck, her husband in the head,
authorities said.
   District Attorney Charles Baker declined to discuss a possible
motive. He said his office will seek to have the teen-ager tried as
an adult.
   ``We're going to review the evidence in relation to the charges,
and there is a possibility that those charges will be upgraded to
capital murder,'' Baker said.
   The couple lived in the trailer for about a year while a

   A member of a fraternity that was

has been convicted of sexual battery against a Florida State
University student.
   Sean Charles Russell, 23, insisted the 18-year-old woman agreed
to have sex with him at his apartment after a party Jan. 7 at the
Pi Kappa Alpha house. The jury deliberated about two hours Tuesday
before returning the verdict.
   Russell, who is being held in jail, faces 4{ to 7 years in
prison, said prosecutor Marty Moore. No sentencing date was set.
   The woman told police she left the party about 2 a.m. and
volunteered to give Russell a ride home. She said she went inside
his apartment, drank beer and kissed Russell, but she did not
consent to sex.
   Three other members of the fraternity are awaiting trial on
charges they raped a 18-year-old freshmam during a March fraternity
party and then carried her to a neighboring frat house so it would
appear she was assaulted there.
   No trial date has been set. The Pi Kappa Alpha chapter at
Florida State was kicked off campus as a result of the charges.

   President Reagan unveiled the cornerstone of
the Holocaust Memorial Museum on Wednesday and challenged the
Soviet Union to relax its restrictions on Jewish emigration,
saying, ``Let these people go.''
   ``In these days of glasnost, we hear talk of liberalizing
attitudes toward Judaism in the Soviet Union,'' the president told
about 1,500 people gathered in a tent at the museum site near the
Washington Monument.
   But he said ``there are still tens of thousands, maybe even
hundreds of thousands'' of Jews waiting to leave the Soviet Union.
   ``And here, as we lay this cornerstone and vow that the Jewish
people will never stand alone against tyranny, I want to ask the
Soviet leaders a question: Where are those exit visas? Where are
they?'' he said.
   ``You and I and all Americans of good will are united in the
challenge I propose to the Soviet leaders today,'' he said. ``I
say: let these people go.''
   The president, assisted by Harvey M. Meyerhoff of Baltimore,
chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Commission, pulled a gold
cord to reveal the chunk of pink North Carolina granite that will
stand at the corner of the museum.
   The museum, being built with private funds on land donated by
the federal government, is expected to open late in 1990 to
commemorate th Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews and other
persecuted people were killed in Europe by Adolf Hitler's Nazis.
   Reagan said the museum ``will examine the nature and meaning of
the continuing curse that is anti-Semitism.''
   ``I think all of us here are aware of those, even among our own
countrymen, who have dedicated themselves to the disgusting task of
minimizing or even denying the truth of the Holocaust,'' he said.
   ``This act of intellectual genocide must not go unchallenged and
those who advance these views must be held up to the scorn and
wrath of all good and thinking people,'' he said.
   ``We know that the United Nations, whose peacekeepers were
honored only last week for their service to the world, has yet to
repeal its infamous resolution equating Zionism and racism,'' the
president said. ``We know where such intellectual infamy can lead.''
   Later, the president met in the White House Rose Garden with
emigres Yury and Tanya Zieman and their daughter, Vera, 12. The
family arrived in the United States Aug. 12 after a wait of more
than a decade for permission to leave the Soviet Union. Zieman is a
mathematician and computer scientist and his wife is attending
school. They live in Belmont, Mass.

<HEAD>US Says Soviets Take `Unconstructive Approach' On Berlin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department accused the Soviet Union
on Wednesday of taking an ``unconstructive approach'' on a proposal
by President Reagan to expand air links to West Berlin.
   ``They must understand that progress in East-West relations
cannot bypass Berlin,'' spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said. She did
not say whether the Soviets had actually turned Reagan down, but
she implied they had.
   ``The problem has much to do with differing interpretations of
the agreement governing the status of the city,'' said another U.S.
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The president, in a speech at the Berlin Wall on June 12, 1987,
urged the expansion of air service to Berlin and promotion of more
international conferences, youth exchanges and sporting events
there.
   The city, which was the capital of Nazi Germany in World War II,
has been administered since then by the four allied victors: the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   While Bonn is now the capital of West Germany, the three Western
countries keep trying to strengthen ties with West Berlin, which is
110 miles inside East Germany, a Soviet ally.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has called repeatedly for
tearing down the Berlin Wall, which effectively separates East and
West.
   ``We are disappointed by the Soviets' unconstructive approach to
the initiative,'' Mrs. Oakley said. ``They must understand that
progress in East-West relations cannot bypass Berlin, and that
stability in and around the city can only be maintained over time
by taking steps to meet the legitimate aspirations of Berliners for
positive change.''
   She said the United States would continue to press for progress
on the initiative and its goals.
   ``I am not going to get into the details of their communication
this,'' the spokeswoman said of the Sept. 15 Soviet response.
``Obviously, we feel that it was not forthcoming. But we're going
to continue to press them on it.''

   The Reagan administration on Wednesday urged
Soviet authorities to stop using violence to break up peaceful
protests in the Baltic republic of Lithuania.
   ``The United States government deplores the recent pattern of
systematic violence by the Soviet authorities directed against
peaceful demonstrations in Lithuania,'' said State Department
spokesman Ben Justesen.
   ``The unjustified and unprovoked attacks have injured more than
a dozen individuals,'' he said, reading a prepared statement.
   Activists in Lithuania and two other Baltic states, Latvia and
Estonia, have become increasingly restive under the policy of
greater openness in the Soviet Union. They have focused their
protests against the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact under which Germany
annexed western Poland the Red Army occupied the Baltic states and
eastern Poland.
   The U.S. government does not recognize Soviet authority over
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   Soviet authorities have been cracking down on ethnic unrest,
most recently last week in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.
   Activists in Vilnius told The Associated Press that riot police
wielding truncheons dispersed tens of thousands of demonstrators.
   The State Department statement said that ``in the Sept. 28
demonstration in Vilnius, more than 10 persons were injured by
police to prevent the non-violent expression of political views.''
   ``During the past weeks, organizers of peaceful demonstrations
have been injured by unknown persons in attacks believed to be
officially sanctioned,'' the statement said. ``We call upon the
Soviet authorities to refrain from the use of force against
peaceful marchers and to discipline those officials responsible.''

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency said
Wednesday it will ban manufacture of the coyote-killing compound
used in baited collars for sheep, a move expected to anger ranchers
and state officials in the West.
   The agency also said Wednesday that it was ordering a temporary
halt to sales of strychnine pesticide products, which are used
mainly against field rodents.
   The agency said it will cancel the federal pesticide license of
the only manufacturer of sodium fluoroacetate, known as ``Compound
1080,'' which is put into baited sheep collars. The producer, Tull
Chemical Co. of Oxford, Ala., failed to provide data requested by
EPA, agency spokesman Al Heier said.
   The federal Agriculture Department, the Wyoming Agriculture
Department, the Montana Livestock Department and Ranchers Supply
Co. of Alpine, Texas, have licenses to use and sell the product.
All will be permitted to continue distributing and using them, but
they will have to submit safety data on their use to EPA.
   Agency spokesman Al Heier said the collar's users ``are going to
have to work like heck to get an alternate supply of the chemical.''
   Heier said another manufacturer could attempt to win a license
by providing the information the EPA wants.
   EPA also said it was suspending all licenses for use of Compound
1080 against rodents, in which it is dispersed in pellets.
   The Nixon administration banned the use of Compound 1080 in
1972, after its widespread use in baited carcasses by ranchers led
conservationists to protest that it was killing eagles and other
wildlife.
   But pressure from ranchers prompted EPA to reverse itself in
1985 and permit Compound 1080 to be used in closed collars on
sheep. Coyotes puncture the collar and ingest fatal doses when they
seize sheep by the neck.
   The agency also announced Wednesday that it was temporarily
suspending all licenses for sale of strychnine products. At the
same time, the agency said it had temporarily canceled licenses, a
more serious action, for sale and above-ground use of all
pesticides containing strychnine. This temporary cancelation is
effective immediately.
   The suspension of strychnine products would halt the sale, but
not the use, of the pesticide. The temporary cancellation of
licenses for use of above-ground strychnine halts that product's
use, but allows the pesticide to be used below ground.
   The squirrels can devastate otherwise productive land, and the
only alternative to strychnine, sometimes applied from the air, is
manual application of poisonous phosgene gas in below-ground
burrows.
   Most strychnine licenses are held by state and local governments
in the West and the U.S. Agriculture Department.
   The strychnine temporary cancellation complies with the order of
a federal court in Minnesota issued in April requiring the agency
to halt above-ground use while it developed means to protect
non-target species. The agency has appealed the order but has lost
a request for a stay.
   The suspensions are the result of failure of state and local
governments to provide EPA with safety data, Heier said.
   Except for the strychnine temporary cancellation, all the
actions are effective in 30 days unless license holders request
hearings. If those hearings are held, the products may still be
used.

   Hundreds of youths rioting against
inflation virtually took over the capital's central district
Wednesday, setting cars ablaze and breaking shop windows while
police looked on, witnesses reported.
   The rioters, mostly schoolboys and university students, were
protesting a constantly increasing cost of living and consequent
reductions in real wages.
   Algeria has been hit by several strikes recently and new ones
were reported Wednesday at the offices of the carrier Air Algerie,
the post office and in various industries.
   Gangs of several hundred youngsters were seen overturning cars
and setting them afire on the main shopping streets, Didouche
Mourad and Mohamed Ben M'Hidi.
   They broke windows of shops and government-owned department
stores and attacked the information office of the Polisario
independence movement of the Western Sahara. Glass littered the
streets for well over a mile.
   One group of rioters stopped a bus, made the driver get out and
then broke all the windows, witnesses reported. The offices of the
West German airline Lufthansa and the Czechoslovak airline CSA were
wrecked, as were many shops that did not get their metal curtains
down quickly.
   At the Lufthansa office, counters were overturned, reservation
computers ripped out and documents scattered in the street.
   Rioters also invaded libraries, cafes and restaurants. A
nightclub called ``Blue Note'' was destroyed.
   About 100 young rioters brought bottles from inside the club and
used them as projectiles. Others carried the furniture from the
government's National Publicity Agency and set fire to it front of
the central post office.
   Security forces did little to stop the rampage, but several
vehicles carrying riot police with tear gas launchers took
positions at midday around the main Air Algerie office near the
lower end of Didouche Mourad. It office was not damaged.
   Young people were seen hurling stones at small groups of police
in side streets.
   Workers who struck an auto parts factory in late September said
they had not had a raise in years. Their strike led to a
confrontation with police.
   Employees of the plant earn the equivalent of $270-$330 a month
while many prices have soared because of new government economic
policies intended to ``rationalize consumption'' and encourage
production.
   Bread is subsidized and still sells for about 17 cents, but beef
costs nearly $12 a pound.
   Strikers and protesters also complain of shortages. Butter, for
example, has not been available for about a month.
   President Chadli Bendjedid says the reforms are necessary but
his government announced Tuesday in conjunction with the General
Union of Algerian Workers, the country's only labor union, that an
effort would be made to provide more staples at lower prices.

   The state is expected to ask a judge
Thursday to make public a grand jury's investigation of the Tawana
Brawley case that reportedly concludes the black teen-ager lied
when she said she was kidnapped and raped by six whites.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams likely will go before state
Supreme Court Justice Angelo J. Ingrassia asking that he release
the grand jury report, Gary Fryer, a spokesman for Gov. Mario
Cuomo, said. In New York, the Supreme Court is the trial-level
court.
   Lanie Accles, spokeswoman for Abrams, said she had no comment on
any anticipated actions by the grand jury.
   The New York Times reported last month that the grand jury
concluded overwhelming evidence indicates the 16-year-old former
Wappingers Falls girl made up the story, perhaps to avoid
punishment for late nights out.
   Miss Brawley was found Nov. 28, 1987, her body smeared with
excrement and racial slurs. She claimed she had been held captive
and raped, but the teen-ager and her family refused to cooperate
with investigators, saying they couldn't get justice from the legal
system.
   Miss Brawley and her advisers denounced the Times report and
denied that she had staged the incident.

   Legislation to extend to Senate staffers the
same protection against job discrimination that most American
workers received 24 years ago was introduced Wednesday by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz.
   The bill is similar to a measure approved by the House for its
employees on Tuesday.
   The House voted 408-12 to give the protections of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 to the 12,137 people who work for House members,
committees or in various Capitol offices.
   It means that discrimination on the basis of race, color,
national origin, religion, sex, handicap or age will be illegal in
the House.
   In introducing the Senate bill, McCain said such action was
``long, long, overdue.''
   ``For too long, the Senate has operated under different rules
from other employers,'' McCain said. ``For too long, the Senate has
exempted itself from rules regarding discrimination. We need to ask
ourselves some questions: Are we fair to our employees? Is it
really fair for them not to have the same safeguards that all other
citizens throughout the country enjoy?''

<HEAD>Report Urges Better Information Systems for Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The spread of electronic data systems poses
the need for Congress to improve the way the government distributes
information, the congressional Office of Technology Assessment said
Wednesday.
   The report said existing laws and the government's methods for
information dissemination, established by Congress largely during
the pre-electronic era, have been overtaken by technology.
   ``The government is at a crucial point where opportunities
presented by the information technologies, such as productivity and
cost-effectiveness improvements, are substantial,'' the agency said.
   Bibliographic, reference, statistical and scientific and
technical information produced by the federal government is
particularly well-suited to electronic formats.
   But the major federal information systems _ the Government
Printing Office document sales program, the Depository Library
Program and the National Technical Information Service _ are
limited largely to paper and microfiche.
   Full use of electronic technologies could help these agencies,
OTA said.
   ``What OTA tells us in their report is that the methods we
depend on to transmit information have reached their limits, and
that new technologies are waiting to change the way government
communicates,'' said Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House
Committee on Science, Space and Technology.

   Four Americans said Wednesday they will
float dollar bills down the Mekong River to spread news of a $2.4
million reward for U.S. prisoners of war they say are alive in the
``black hole'' of Laos.
   Two other Americans, also from the National Steering Committee
for American War Veterans, were arrested this week while on a
similar mission.
   Laotian authorities on Sunday arrested Donna Long, 45, of
Jacksonville, N.C., and James Copp, 43, a Vietnam War veteran from
Hampstead, N.C., after they crossed the Mekong River in a rented
boat and landed in a village in Laos. The river forms the boundary
with Thailand, then flows to Cambodia and Vietnam.
   The six, four of whom are Vietnam War veterans, have said they
hope to trace American prisoners of war they believe are still
being held in the communist countries of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam.
   ``We call Laos the black hole of the MIA issue,'' said committee
chairman Ted Sampley, a former Green Beret from Kingston, N.C.
   The other members of the group are William Sullivan, of
Jacksonville, N.C., a Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War; Lynn
Hampton, of Winter Haven, Fla., who served in the war as a nurse;
and Bruce Adams, a dentist from Laramie, Wyo.
   On Thursday, the four plan to travel to the northeastern Thai
city of Ubon and drop $2,000 into the Mekong River at the same spot
from which their colleagues left for Laos.
   Long and Copp carried about $3,000 as well as other currency
they planned to drop into the river or give to Laotian villagers.
Each dollar bill was stamped with the reward offer and wrapped in a
plastic bag.
   The members of the new expedition, who say they will not attempt
to cross the Mekong River, said Long and Copp had apparently ``gone
above and beyond what we asked them to do.''
   ``We're not Rambo types. We did not come over here in any kind
of militant mode,'' said Adams, whose brother Stephen was declared
missing in action in Laos 22 years ago. ``I don't want my brother's
bones back. I want the flesh and blood that goes with the man.''
   The U.S. government lists 2,393 Americans as missing in action
in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. The three governments deny holding
any live Americans.
   But the group, which claims the U.S. government has neglected
the issue, says it's convinced there are still American POWs in
Laos based on reports by refugees of having seen Americans, and
other evidence.
   Sampley said the money the group brought with them was pledged
by 21 congressmen, private individuals and corporate donors.
   The group of six were to have traveled together, Sampley said,
but airline reservations problems forced Long and Copp to arrive in
Thailand before the others.
   Ross Petzing, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Bangkok, said
Tuesday that Long and Copp were being held at Ban Sing Samphan in
the southern Laotian province of Champasak. He could not confirm
whether they were still in the village or had been moved to the
capital, Vientiane.
   Pornthipa Vajarabukka, a Thai hotel manager, said she visited
Long and Copp on Tuesday in a small house in the village, but was
not allowed to speak to them. She said authorities told her Monday
the two would be released within three days.
   Pornthipa added that she felt responsible for Long and Copp _
who speak neither Thai nor Lao _ because the Americans had
contacted the hotel before their trip across the river.
   It was not known if Long and Copp had floated money down the
river, and details of how they were arrested were not available.
   A U.S. Embassy official in Laos, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Wednesday that the Laotian government has not
responded to an official query about the two Americans.

<HEAD>U.N. Sources Say Iran Agrees To Stop Searching Ships In Persian
Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has agreed to stop searching ships in
international waters of the Persian Gulf which it suspects of
carrying war cargo to Iraq, sources in the United Nations said
Wednesday.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said Iraq
agreed to postpone discussing ownership of the disputed
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the gulf. Iran has a
long gulf coastline with numerous ports.
   Breakthroughs on these two issues could help end the stalemate
in the Iran-Iraq peace talks that began Aug. 25 in Geneva. The two
neighbors in the oil-rich gulf, at war for eight years, agreed on
Aug. 20 to a U.N.-sponsored truce.
   The sources said U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
proposed the compromises during talks that began last week with the
foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq. Those talks ended Wednesday.
   Under the proposals, Iran will no longer stop vessels flying a
neutral flag in international gulf waters and the Strait of Hormuz,
and Iraq consented to discuss its claims to Shatt-al-Arab later in
the negotiations, the sources said.
   Both parties will begin arranging a withdrawal of their forces
to the internationally recognized border and will discuss
repatriation of prisoners of war, they added.
   No announcement of the compromise will be issued until peace
talks resume in Geneva later this month because Iraq wants to wait
and see if Tehran honors the agreement, the sources said.
   In addition, Perez de Cuellar and the Iranian and Iraqi
diplomats agreed not to discuss details of their talks while
progress is being made in negotiations between their lower-ranked
representatives.
   Iraq's insistence that Shatt-al-Arab be cleared of sunken ships
and dredged to remove silt has blocked progress in the talks.
   To be taken up later in the peace talks is the issue of whether
both nations share rights to the waterway under a 1975 treaty or
whether Iraq has sovereignty over the whole passage and both its
banks, the sources reported.
   Baghdad also complained that Iran's searching of ships for
Iraq-bound war cargo violated a U.N. Security Council resolution
calling for the parties to ``discontinue all military activities on
land, at sea and in the air.''
   Iran held that searching for war cargo was a right that nations
at war generally are recognized to have.
   The Iran-Iraq war broke out in September 1980 when Iraqi forces
invaded western Iran after weeks of border skirmishes.
   More than 1 million casualties are estimated to have resulted
from the war.

<TEXT>
   Egypt marked the 15th anniversary of the
last Middle East war Wednesday with its first military parade since
President Anwar Sadat was assassinated in 1981.
   President Hosni Mubarak, Sadat's vice president and successor,
watched from an elevated viewing box.
   On Oct. 6, 1981, Mubarak stood beside Sadat when Moslem
extremists bolted from a truck and sprayed the ground-level
reviewing stand with bullets that felled the president.
   Sadat and seven others died in attack led by an army lieutenant.
Twenty-eight people were wounded, but Mubarak was unhurt.
   On Wednesday, only Mubarak, his ministers, diplomats and other
officials were allowed into the suburban Military College to watch
the parade, which was televised and broadcast on radio.
   Earlier, Mubarak laid a wreath at Sadat's tomb and that of Gamal
Abdel Nasser, leader of the 1952 coup that ended the Egyptian
monarchy. Sadat was an army lieutenant colonel in Nasser's Free
Officers, who were responsible for the coup.
   In a videotaped speech broadcast before the wreath-laying,
Mubarak praised Sadat as a hero for engineering the surprise attack
on Israel that began the 1973 war and for signing a peace treaty
with the Jewish state six years later.
   Wednesday's parade mainly celebrated the military exploits of
the 1973 conflict.
   In Sadat's time, the annual military parade would fill one of
metropolitan Cairo's largest streets with tanks, artillery and men.
In Wednesday's parade, tanks, missiles and other heavy weapons
passed the reviewing stand on truck-drawn trailers.
   Since Sadat's death, Egypt's annual commemoration of the 1973
war has been limited to a televised speech by Mubarak on Oct. 6,
the anniversary of the capture of Israeli positions in the occupied
Sinai Peninsula that constituted Egypt's only success in four wars
with Israel.
   No explanation was given for either the decision to have a
parade this year or moving the celebration forward a day.
   The Oct. 6 parade became a tradition under Sadat, who watched
the displays dressed in a resplendent military uniform. On the day
he died, Sadat wore a white, gold-braided uniform with high boots.
   Mubarak, a former fighter pilot, was dressed in an air force
uniform on that day.
   It was his last public appearance in military uniform. On
Wednesday, he wore a blue suit and mirrored sunglasses.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Cautions Romania's Ceausescu on Maverick Policies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cautioned visiting
Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu on Wednesday that his maverick
policies may discredit socialism and the entire East bloc.
   Gorbachev, who has headed the Soviet Communist Party since 1985,
said, ``The notion of socialism will be formed on the basis of
evaluating the combined experience of socialist nations. The
success of each of them will be a common ideological achievement.
But the failure of any can, alas, mean a common setback too.''
   In reply, Ceausescu lauded the ``traditions of cooperation and
revolutionary solidarity'' between his country and the Soviet
Union, but asserted Romania's right to chart its own political
course.
   ``One should always bear in mind the fact that the revolutionary
process is unfolding in each country in different conditions,''
Ceausescu, who heads Romania's Communist Party, said.
   Their remarks at a Kremlin luncheon were reported by the
official Soviet news agency Tass. Ceausescu, accompanied by his
wife Elena and by Romanian officials, arrived in Moscow on Tuesday
for talks with the Soviets.
   Ceausescu has balked at following Gorbachev's social and
economic reform program, known by its Russian-language name of
``perestroika'' or restructuring.
   Gorbachev noted that ``all the socialist countries have their
own distinctive features,'' but said common action by the Soviet
Union and its allies was necessary.
   ``It is the initiative and identity shown by each fraternal
country in its contribution to achieving the objectives of their
concerted policies that broaden the range of socialism's influence
on international processes,'' he said.
   Gorbachev also made a pitch for his own economic, political and
social reforms, which he said were becoming part of Soviet life,
although not as fast as had been hoped.
   ``We see this as the best proof that perestroika will definitely
succeed,'' he said.
   Ceausescu has stirred a storm of protest in Hungary and
elsewhere over his plan to raze up to 7,000 villages, including
about 800 ethnic Hungarian communities, and resettle the population
in so-called agro-industrial centers.
   Romania has also drawn fire for stalling the 35-nation review
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna over
human rights provisions to be included in a final document.
   Gorbachev did not refer directly to those disputes, but
mentioned the need for ``respect for the rights and freedoms of
each citizen,'' and for ``the observance of legality and of the
rule of law.''
   On his visit to Romania in May 1987, Gorbachev implicitly
criticized in a televised speech the nepotism and personality cult
Ceausescu promotes in that country.
   He also demanded higher-quality goods to be delivered from
Romania, where widespread food and energy shortages make life
difficult for the country's 25 million people.
   Ceausescu admitted in a speech Monday that Romanian industry has
failed to meet export targets for this year.
   One issue likely to be discussed during Ceausescu's visit is
Romania's desire to obtain more Soviet crude oil and raw materials
in return for Romanian wheat, meat and agricultural products.

   Cher's boyfriend was charged with reckless
driving and malicious mischief Wednesday over a confrontation June
27 in which his car crashed into a photographer's outside the home
he shares with the actress.
   The misdemeanor offenses are less serious than the felony charge
of assault with a deadly weapon on which Rob Camilletti, 24, was
booked.
   ``There was insufficient evidence of any attempt of assault,
based on the statements of witnesses,'' said Mike Qualls, spokesman
for the City Attorney's office.
   Camilletti was driving Cher's black Ferrari when it hit a car
belonging to Peter Brandt, a photographer for the entertainment
tabloid Star. Camilletti was released on $2,000 bail.
   The bagel maker and aspiring actor said he lost control of his
car while trying to swerve into the driveway to avoid the
photographers. Brandt accused Camilletti of trying to kill him and
sued the couple for unspecified damages.
   ``I'm very pleased that the city attorney understood that I
never tried to hit the tabloid photographer,'' Camiletti said in a
statement. ``It's true that I broke the guy's camera and telephone
after the accident, and I intend to reimburse him for that.''
   ``With this decision not to file any felony charges, I am now
hopeful that Cher and I can get back to some degree of normalcy
with our lives,'' Camilletti said.
   ``I think he should have been charged with assault with a deadly
weapon. No, I'm not pleased with these charges,'' said Brandt. ``I
guess the city attorney thought it was an accident. But I'm glad
they filed something.''
   Reckless driving carries up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000
fine, and the two counts of malicious mischief could bring up to 18
months in jail and $6,000 in fines.

   A fire sparked by a welder's torch spread
smoke through three floors of a hospital building Wednesday,
forcing the evacuation of about 50 outpatients. No one was injured
in the fire, authorities said.
   The evacuated patients were moved to another hospital building
or onto buses, while nurses, doctors and staff waited outside, many
of them wrapped in white hospital blankets to fend off the cold and
an intermittent drizzle.
   Only the basement and first and second floors of Everett Tower,
the main building of Oklahoma Memorial Hospital, had to be
evacuated, said hospital spokeswoman Kathy Kirk. The lowest floor
on which patients are housed is the fourth floor, she said.
   A welder's torch ignited insulation in a ceiling around an
elevator shaft in the building's southeast corner, and the smoke
spread quickly, setting off alarms, said fire department spokesman
Jon Hansen.

<TEXT>
   Explosions damaged two court
buildings Wednesday night in suburbs of Cape Town and Johannesburg,
police reported.
   They said one was hurt in the blast outside Cape Town and there
were no immediate reports of injuries in the Johannesburg explosion.
   In another development, an organization opposed to the military
draft said police put tight restrictions on its leader Wednesday.
   The first of the two explosions occurred shortly after 7 p.m. at
the Stellenbosch Magistrates Court about 25 miles east of Cape
Town, police said. The second took place about two hours later at
the Alexandra Magistrates Court in a small business district that
separates the impoverished black township of Alexandra from
affluent white suburbs of Johannesburg.
   Police did not give details of damage to either building or the
cause of the explosions.
   At least 148 bombings have taken place in South Africa since the
government declared a nationwide state of emergency June 12, 1986,
including a record 29 in September.
   President P.W. Botha's government has blamed virtually all of
them on the the outlawed African National Congress, the main
guerrilla group fighting white domination.
   Anti-apartheid activists suggest, howeer, that recent attacks on
anti-apartheid groups and public facilities frequented mostly by
blacks were the work of right-wing whites.
   The End Conscription Campaign said its national secretary,
Alastair Teeling-Smith, was ordered not to speak with journalists,
prepare material for publication or attend any gathering convened
for the purpose of criticizing government policy.
   He and his organization oppose the mandatory military service
required of white South African men. It has appealed unsuccessfully
for alternative non-military service for men politically or morally
opposed to joining the army.
   Military service for other race groups is voluntary.
   Teeling-Smith's group was banned Aug. 22, three weeks after 143
white males _ including doctors, lawyers and scientists _
publically announced their refusal of military service.

   Jim Bakker said Wednesday he's not out of
the PTL picture, even though it appears most of the assets of the
television ministry he founded will be bought by a Canadian
businessman.
   ``It's not over till it's over, as I've been saying,'' Bakker
said in front of the new Jim and Tammy Information Office about two
miles from Heritage USA, site of PTL's Christian theme park and
television studios. ``It seems every few weeks we go through it's
been sold again, and sold again.''
   PTL's court-appointed trustee, M.C. ``Red'' Benton announced
Tuesday he had signed a contract with Stephen Mernick of Toronto to
buy the ministry's assets for $115 million. Benton had identified
other potential buyers but had not previously gotten to the
contract stage.
   Charlotte, N.C., attorney Joseph Kluttz said his client Mernick
will pay $50 million at closing for the deal and pay the $65
million balance over five years.
   Mernick has not said what he plans to do with Heritage USA, but
wrote in a Sept. 15 letter to Benton that he would consider
``preserving or enhancing the Christian orientation'' even though
he is an Orthodox Jew.
   PTL must sell its assets to pay creditors as soon as possible
under an order from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds in
Columbia.
   Bakker, who left the now crumbling evangelical empire in March
1987 amid a sex-and-money scnadal, said he would not consider the
ramifications of a PTL sale ``until I hear the final gavel of the
judge.''
   ``It still has to be ratified by the judge, by the creditors,
and then it's still subject to the condition upon transfer of the
satellite contract _ (which) is a non-transferrable contract, so
that has to be approved,'' Bakker said.
   ``Then Mr. Mernick has 30 days to just walk away with no
penalties, if he wants to,'' Bakker said.
   ``That to me is not as strong a deal as I would have liked to
have seen, anybody who can just walk away without losing something
has a pretty good deal on his side.''
   Benton has said other bidders may present offers directly to the
bankruptcy court, but he said his recommendation gives Mernick's
offer a strong upper hand. Reynolds is expected to hold a hearing
on the sale about a month from now.
   Bakker proposed a $172 million plan to buy the ministry's
assets, but his bid lost credibility last month when he could not
come up with a $3 million down payment.
   Convinced he still can put together a deal and eventually
restore his television ministry, Bakker has assembled a staff that
shares his faith.
   ``We know Jim and Tammy will be restored, we just don't know
what route God will use to accomplish that,'' said Lin Robertson,
who was answering one of the many phones ringing at the information
center.
   ``And when they get back to Heritage, it will be done in such a
way that everybody will know it was done by the hand of God, not by
the hand of man,'' Ms. Robertson said.
   ``God is moving on Jim's behalf,'' said Joyce LeBaron, referring
to the Bakkers hoped-for return to television.
   ``We're really not concerned about Mr. Mernick, we're not upset
about it at all,'' said Peggy Licata. ``It's just an interim
thing.''

   A student who failed an economics test
twice but made good class grades is suing the University of Central
Florida to either receive a master's degree in business
administration or get her $5,000 tuition back.
   ``After paying all my dues and having a good average, I just
feel abused,'' said Nora Roth, 48. ``I really don't want their
money. I just want what I earned, which is a master's degree.''
   The dean of the school's College of Business, Clifford Eubanks,
defended the test format that requires students to review all the
material they have learned: finance, management, marketing and
economics.
   After passing the three other parts of the test, Mrs. Roth
failed the economics section. She hired a tutor, crammed for
another semester and took the test again but failed once more.
   Mrs. Roth, who commuted 100 miles round-trip for two years from
Cocoa Beach to the Orlando school for classes, filed suit last week
with the help of her husband, Kenneth, who is a lawyer.
   She alleged the test is unfair because each of the business
school's economics professors hold different theories and place
emphasis on different facets of the subject. Her test was prepared
by a professor she did not study under and included material she
had never studied, she contended.
   Eubanks said Tuesday the comprehensive test is common at
colleges across the country.
   Most of the school's MBA candidates are part-time students,
Eubanks said, and they spend up to five years earning the degree. A
comprehensive test ensures that students retain the material they
learned at the beginning, he said.
   Eubanks said it was not uncommon for students to fail the test
several times and that Mrs. Roth can take it again.

<HEAD>Stop & Shop Settles Coupon Dispute For Nearly $5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stop & Shop Cos. Inc. will return $4.9 million in
coupons and other benefits to consumers under a settlement in a
1985 price-fixing case, it was announced Wednesday.
   ``This settlement will return money to the wallets of shoppers
who were deprived of the discounts they were entitled to in the
first place,'' state Attorney General James Shannon said in a
statement.
   Sandy Bouzoukis, spokeswoman for Braintree-based Stop & Shop,
said the supermarket chain ``reached the settlement with the
attorney general to avoid the further consumption of time and cost
of litigation'' without admitting liability or wrong-doing in the
case.
   The attorney general sued Stop & Shop, Waldbaum Inc. and First
National Supermarkets in 1985, charging them with conspiring to
terminate double coupon offers between 1978 and 1982.
   The charges against Waldbaum were resolved in a $2.6 million
settlement in 1987. The case against First National is still
pending in federal court.
   Under the settlement, Stop & Shop will distribute $3 million in
coupons to western Massachusetts households in January, February
and March.
   Consumers will be able to redeem the $2 coupons when they make
purchases of $20 or more in western Massachusetts stores. Each
coupon will be valid for 14 days.
   In addition, the supermarket chain will issue 1.6 million $1
coupons which will be redeemable on purchases of $10 or more at
eastern Massachusetts stores. The distribution dates for these
coupons will be announced later.
   The coupons will be included in newspaper inserts and mailers
delivered to households and in advertising circulars available at
Stop & Shop stores. Stop & Shop operates 60 stores in the state.
   ``I urge consumers to take full advantage of this settlement by
cutting out the coupons and redeeming them,'' Shannon said.
   Stop & Shop also agreed to donate $100,000 in high-protein food
to the Western Massachusetts Food Bank and to reimburse the state
$200,000 in litigation costs.

<HEAD>President Aquino Acknowledges Failure To Solve Nation's Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino acknowledged
Wednesday at the funeral of a leading critic of her government that
her administration had failed to solve the country's problems.
   She also stressed the need to uplift the lives of poor Filipinos
during an emotional eulogy for newspaper publisher Joaquin Roces,
who persuaded her to run for office but later rebuked her for her
failures.
   Roces, 75, publisher of The Manila Times and a key figure in the
struggle to oust former President Ferdinand Marcos, died Friday of
cancer. Prominent business and government leaders attended his
funeral.
   After receiving the Legion of Honor from Mrs. Aquino in July,
Roces publicly chided her for failing to establish a ``new moral
order'' after the Marcos government fell in February 1986 and she
was swept into the presidency.
   ``It hurt when he said it, but it had to be said,'' the
president said, her voice breaking with emotion. ``And he was one
with the moral authority to say it. He has warned us that we, the
friends of democracy, shall have a worse time of it than the clear
enemies of the people if we fail the people.''
   The Aquino government has been under fire in the press on
charges of corruption, mismanagement and promotion of officials
chosen more for loyalty than for merit.
   The banned Communist Party of the Philippines sent a statement
to news agencies Wednesday hailing Roces' role in anti-Marcos
protests and his later criticism of the Aquino government.
   In a raid Wednesday, police meanwhile arrested Master Sgt.
Godofredo Gamboa, a purported aide of former Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan. A senior officer said investigators were
closing in on the elusive Honasan, who was arrested in December but
escaped from a prison ship in Manila Bay in April.
   Col. Manuel Oxales, deputy military commander of Manila, told
reporters that raiders seized a .45 caliber pistol and ammunition
at Gamboa's home in suburban Caloocan city. Gamboa, a former
counterintelligence agent, denied involvement in any attempts to
topple Mrs. Aquino, but Oxales said the sergeant was a ``close
contact man'' of Honasan.
   Gamboa faces weapons charges.
   Wednesday's arrest brought to 74 the number of alleged
right-wing figures taken into custody in recent weeks, including
key officers of last year's failed coup which left at least 53 dead
and more than 300 wounded.
   Honasan played a major role in the military-civilian revolt
which toppled Marcos and propelled Mrs. Aquino to office. He grew
disillusioned with Mrs. Aquino, however, complaining that she
failed to crush the communist rebellion, now in its 19th year, and
rid the government of corruption.

<HEAD>New Ads Go After Record On Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The campaign of Democratic presidential
nominee Michael Dukakis on Wednesday unveiled four new television
ads attacking Republican rival George Bush for his record on
education, environment, drugs and Social Security.
   Some of the ads, each lasting 30 seconds and dealing with one of
those four themes, began airing nationwide Wednesday night, Dukakis
media spokeswoman Lorraine Voles said Wednesday in a telephone
interview from Boston. She had no information on how long the ads
would run.
   The ads said the administration dealt secretly with Manuel
Antonio Noriega, ``the Panamanian drug lord,'' Bush ``personally''
weakened environmental regulations, ``personally'' cast the
tie-breaking vote to cut Social Security'' in 1985 and ``sat by
while college loans for working families were cut.''
   Three of the ads bore the pro-Dukakis tag line, ``The best
America is yet to come.''
   The ads carry lines questioning the sincerity of Bush's stances
and suggesting he has made election-year conversions. ``And now
suddenly George Bush tells you he's going to be the
environmentalist president?'' says one. ``And now suddenly George
Bush says he'll be the education president?'' says another.
   Ms. Voles said the new ads will be running while a set of four
ads dealing with ``the packaging of George'' continues. Those ads
depict Bush's consultants sitting around a table trying to
``package'' a candidate who has no positions that the American
people can support.
   An earlier ad called ``New Era'' is also airing.

<TEXT>
   In the Soviet Union a theft is committed every 40
seconds on the average, one rape every hour and a premeditated
murder every 90 minutes, the government newspaper Izvestia reported
Wednesday.
   Izvestia made the figures public in an article marking the 70th
anniversary of the Ministry of Interior's Criminal Investigation
Department, in charge of tracking down crime suspects.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for
``glasnost,'' or openness, more is becoming known about crime _ a
subject once virtually taboo in the state-run media.
   As one example, Radio Moscow revealed in March that 9,000 people
were murdered in the country in 1987.
   Extrapolating from the figures printed by Izvestia, which the
paper said came from the Criminal Investigation Department, 2,160
thefts, 24 rapes and 16 murders take place in the Soviet Union on
an average day.
   On a yearly basis, that would total 788,400 thefts, 8,760 rapes
and 5,840 premeditated murders for the nation as a whole.
   Detailed crime incidence reports are still not made public in
the Soviet Union, but officials in Moscow maintain that violent
crime is far less of a problem than in the United States. They cite
the small number of privately owned firearms as one major reason.

<TEXT>
   A second national poll has found Democrat
Michael Dukakis closing on George Bush in the presidential race,
although a newer survey released Wednesday gave the Republican a
slightly better lead.
   Both surveys found many voters expressing concern about Bush's
running mate, Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   The newer poll, an ABC News-Washington Post survey conducted
from Sept. 28 through Tuesday, put the race at 51-44 percent with
the Republicans in the numerical lead. The poll of 1,196 likely
voters had an error margin of about four points.
   In the other survey, a Harris poll conducted last week, the
Republicans won support from 49 percent of 1,235 likely voters, to
46 percent for the Democrats. It also was a dead heat, given the
three-point margin of error.
   A Harris poll early last month put the race a bit wider, at
50-44 with Bush and Quayle ahead. Similarly, a CBS News-New York
Times poll released Tuesday put the race at 48-46, tightened from
49-44 later last month.
   The ABC-Post and Harris polls were released on the night of
Quayle's debate with Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the Democratic
vice presidential nominee. Like other polls, both found doubts
about Quayle's qualifications for office.
   In the ABC-Post poll, 40 percent said Quayle was qualified to be
vice president, but 33 percent said not; the rest didn't know. By
contrast, 67 percent said Bentsen was qualified and just 7 percent
said not.
   In the Harris poll, conducted Sept. 24-29, only a third believed
Quayle was qualified to be president if that became necessary. When
respondents were asked their preference for vice president only,
Bentsen beat Quayle solidly, 59-37. And voters by 56-25 percent
said Dukakis had done better than Bush at picking a running mate.

   The State Department on Wednesday dismissed as
``pure fantasy'' an assertion by an Iranian opposition leader that
the Reagan administration secretly negotiated with Tehran for the
release of American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``There have been no negotiations, no direct contacts between
the United States and Iranian officials,'' said spokeswoman Phyllis
Oakley. ``There may be private individuals who misrepresented
themselves as speaking on behalf of the U.S. government. They are
not.''
   Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said Tuesday in
Paris that Richard Lawless, a former U.S. official, had negotiated
on behalf of Vice President George Bush with a representative of
Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   In reply, Mrs. Oakley said: ``We have flatly denied anyone is
speaking on behalf of the U.S. government.''
   Lawless, president of a Washington-based trade investment firm
known as U.S.-Asia, denied through a business partner that he had
engaged in any talks with Iranians about the hostages.
   In a statement Lawless relayed through partner Therese Shaheen,
he said, ``I categorically deny, and state for the record, that I
am involved either directly or indirectly in any discussions or
negotiations with any party related to attempts to secure the
release of hostages in Lebanon.''
   Ms. Shaheen said Lawless can produce passport and charge card
travel records that prove he was not in that part of the world
during the time that Bani-Sadr says he was involved. Lawless is a
former State Department employee who served in Seoul, South Korea;
Vienna, Austria; and Tokyo, Japan, Ms. Shaheen said.
   The New York Times and The Washington Times, quoting sources
they did not identify, reported Wednesday that Lawless worked for
the CIA at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul in the 1970s, during the same
period Bush's national security adviser, Donald Gregg, served with
the CIA in Korea.
   In addition, The New York Times quoted an unidentified former
government official as saying that Lawless had worked in the CIA's
operations directorate until several years ago.
   The State Department's Biographic Register said in its 1974
edition that Lawless had worked as an ``area analyst'' for the
Pentagon and the State Department.
   Mrs. Oakley said the United States had urged other governments
to use their influence to secure the release of the nine Americans
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian bands.
   But she said none of the messages exchanged between the U.S. and
Iranian governments through other countries dealt specifically with
releasing the hostages.
   ``That would involve dealings, negotiations,'' the spokeswoman
said. ``There have been no negotiations on this issue.''
   Asked if Lawless or any other private individual had negotiated
with Iran, Mrs. Oakley said: ``I don't know of anybody who has done
that. But that doesn't exclude the possibility that there may be
somebody out there, as we speak, who says `I'm speaking for the
U.S. government.' I`m just trying to be very prudent and cautious.
But I don't know of any names of anyone who is doing this.''
   She added: ``Only U.S. government officials are authorized to
speak on this matter, and none have.''
   Her immediate comment on Bani-Sadr's assertions were two blunt
words: ``Pure fantasy.''
   With the arrival of Mithileshwar Singh, a freed Indian hostage,
at the U.S. military hospital in Wiesbaden, West Germany, and a
lack of indications the nine Americans would be released, a State
Department task force set up Monday to deal with the situation was
disbanded Tuesday evening.
   President Reagan, talking to reporters, said he has heard
nothing to indicate other hostages might soon be set free. ``We
desperately are hoping, continuing to try,'' he said.
   But he also said, ``I've never been able to explain ... the
Iranians, what their strategies are and what they do. But obviously
we could not do any negotiating with them unless and until the
hostages are released.''
   Mrs. Oakley said Singh, a legal U.S. resident, would travel to
the United States after a thorough medical examination in
Wiesbaden, but his plans had not jelled.
   She said a preliminary checkup in Damascus, where he had been
taken by Syrian forces after his release Monday in Beirut,
confirmed he had ``previously known problems'' of diabetes,
hypertension and possible coronary artery disease and had lost a
considerable amount of weight and muscle mass during his 20-month
captivity.
   ``He was treated with appropriate medicines, is in good spirits
and has traveled well,'' Mrs. Oakley said of the 60-year-old
chairman of the business administration department at the Beirut
University College.
   Singh had been held by the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine. Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian
and a Belgian remain in captivity in Lebanon, according to the
State Department's Office for Counter-Terrorism. Three of the
Americans are believed held by the group that freed Singh.

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A glaucoma patient here complains she is
going blind waiting for permission to legally use marijuana, and a
federal official acknowledged Wednesday that the application
procedure is complicated.
   Elvy Musikka was tried in August on charges of growing marijuana
plants in her back yard. She and her physician successfully argued
that using the drug was the only way to relieve glaucoma's pressure
on her eyes.
   After her arrest, she applied to the Food and Drug
Administration for a federal program to receive pot legally for
medical treatments.
   That was six months ago. Tuesday she said she is already blind
in the right eye, and slowly losing the remaining sight in her left
eye waiting for her application to be processed.
   Faye Peterson, a spokeswoman for the FDA in Washington, said by
law she cannot discuss details of Ms. Musikka's case. But she noted
that even the Drug Enforcement Administration is involved in
clearing applications.
   ``It not only involves this agency, it involves the DEA and the
National Institute on Drug Abuse,'' she said. ``It's not just a
simple matter of saying, `FDA, give us permission.'''
   Appearing with Ms. Mussika at her news conference was
stockbroker Irvin Rosenfeld, who suffers from a rare disease that
causes tumors to grow in his bones. Marijuana enhances the
medication he takes and helps ease the pain. He is one of only two
Broward residents permitted to use the drug legally.
   ``I know how many hours it takes to fill out the paperwork,''
said Rosenfeld. ``This is how they put me off for 5{ years.''
   Since her acquittal by Broward Circuit Judge Mark Polen, Ms.
Musikka said she has been getting marijuana when she can from
friends. It's either that or lose her remaining sight, she said.
   ``Anyone that's helping me now is breaking the law,'' she said.
``They're human people, compassionate people who care.''
   Bob Randall is president of the Alliance for Cannabis
Therapeutics, a Washington-based organization that helps people
legally get marijuana for medical purposes.
   ``We are publicly watching a human being go blind because of an
unresponsive federal government,'' said Randall, who won the legal
right to use marijuana to treat his glaucoma 12 years ago.
   He said it could take a lawsuit against the FDA to force action
on Ms. Mussika's application.
   Ms. Musikka was born with congenital cataracts and developed
glaucoma as she grew up. Glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness
in the United States, increases pressure on the eyeball and optic
nerve and causes a progressive loss of sight.

   An Indianapolis woman facing sentencing for
neglect in the death of her four-year-old son was sterilized to
gain a judge's leniency, her half-brother said Wednesday.
   Melody S. Baldwin, 29, underwent the procedure Tuesday at
Wishard Memorial Hospital. Marion Superior Court Judge Roy E. Jones
had suggested he would be lenient with Baldwin if she were no
longer capable of having more children.
   ``She didn't like it, but said she wanted to do it, mainly to
cooperate with the court,'' James D. Slagle said following a bond
hearing for Baldwin.
   Baldwin gave birth to a son Sunday and gave him up for adoption,
defense attorney Michael J. Donahoe said.
   She pleaded guilty June 10 to neglect of a dependent and, in
exchange, prosecutors dropped a murder charge. The charges said she
``knowingly administered'' lethal doses of two psychotropic drugs
to her son 4-year-old son, Joshua, between Aug. 28 and Sept. 3,
1986.
   She faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Jones
granted a defense motion Wednesday to reinstate a $5,000 bond for
Baldwin and set sentencing for Nov. 9.
   Slagle said he felt his half-sister is not guilty of neglect and
said she entered into the plea agreement because she was
``threatened'' with the possibility of a 20- to 50-year prison term
on the murder charge.

   A comprehensive settlement in Central
America will be impossible to achieve without an understanding
between the United States and Soviet Union, the foreign minister of
Honduras said Wednesday.
   Carlos Lopez Contreras said a major defect of the Central
American peace plan signed Aug. 7, 1987 is its assumption that the
five nations involved could solve their own problems.
   The minister termed this view as ``simplistic'' and said in an
interview the only reason Honduras endorsed the plan was to avoid
being portrayed as an obstacle to peace.
   Lopez Contreras made his statements one day after he spoke to
the U.N. General Assembly and urged the creation of an
international peace force to evict the U.S.-backed Contra rebels
from Honduran territory.
   Thousands of rebels have settled in the border area since
Congress ended military aid to the Contras earlier this year.
   The foreign minister proposed that military units from Spain,
Canada and West Germany carry out the evacuation, using force if
necessary.
   His proposal appeared to represent a break with Reagan
administration policy but the State Department said it was
reviewing the plan with an open mind.
   ``We will give the Honduran proposal serious consideration,''
said State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said. in
Washington.
   Even if a peacekeeping force is agreed to, such a force only
would represent a partial solution, Lopez Contreras said.
   ``We cannot stop the Soviets from supplying arms to the
Sandinistas,'' he said. ``That is an issue that has to be addressed
by the United States.''
   If there is ``not a minimum of understanding between them, it is
going to be absolutely impossible to reach any kind of settlement
in Central America,'' Lopez Contreras declared.
   He said international organizations such as the United Nations
cannot expect Honduras by itself to resolve a problem created in
part by superpower policies.
   The Soviet position, reiterated in talks in Washington last
month, is that the Kremlin would cease arms deliveries to Nicaragua
if the United States suspends lethal aid to its allies in Central
America. The Reagan administration has rejected that proposal.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union said
after his talks in Washington on Sept. 23 that the gap between the
two countries' positions had not narrowed.
   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams is expected to hold
additional discussions with Soviet officials on Central America
later this month.

   Republican Dan Quayle and Democrat Lloyd
Bentsen prepared Wednesday for their prime-time debate, each man
eager to aid his presidential ticket and trade in his Senate seat
for the vice presidency.
   Debate sponsors looked for a television audience in the
millions, presidential standardbearers George Bush and Michael
Dukakis among them.
   For the 67-year-old Bentsen and the 41-year-old Quayle, the
stakes couldn't be higher in a presidential campaign that remained
too close to call. One poll suggested that the Indiana senator's
presence on the Republican ticket was working against Bush.
   Republicans hoped Quayle could reassure voters that he has the
maturity and qualifications to serve as vice president. Democrats
looked to Bentsen to attract undecided moderate and conservative
Democrats to Dukakis' side.
   Bentsen and Quayle both spent the day in final preparations,
taking a close look at the stage where they would face off for
their 90-minute televised encounter.
   ``We're ready,'' said Quayle. ``You're going to see Dan Quayle
as he really is.''
   Bentsen said he was ``feeling great.'' Asked what he would try
to accomplish in the debate, he replied simply, ``Win.''
   The 10,000-seat Omaha Civic Auditorium was condensed into a
2,000-seat theater decorated in red, white and blue for the debate.
Just 100 of the seats were available to the public, the rest
reserved by the campaigns.
   The two camps flew dozens of high-profile supporters to Omaha to
provide immediate post-debate partisan analysis of the encounter,
including many Senate colleagues of Bentsen and Quayle.
   Bush, campaigning in Colorado, declared he was ``not worried a
bit'' about Quayle's performance. Dukakis spent the day at the
Statehouse in Boston and said the public would see ``a very strong,
thoughtful, mature Senator Lloyd Bentsen,'' a slap at Quayle's
youthfulness.
   The vice presidential confrontation was the second of three
planned debates in the fall campaign. Dukakis and Bush squared off
late last month in North Carolina and are expected to meet again
late next week at a site to be determined, probably Los Angeles.
   With the Republicans owning a slight edge in the polls in the
race for the White House, Quayle was hoping to use the debate to
reassure the voters that his youth is not a liability. Bentsen and
the Democrats have sought to depict the Indiana senator as an
inexperienced young man ill-equipped to be a heartbeat away from
the presidency.
   Polls have indicated Quayle is a drag on the Republican ticket.
A CBS poll released earlier in the week suggested that Bush had a
slightly larger lead over Dukakis when voters were queried only
about the top of the ticket.
   A pair of surveys released Wednesday reiterated those concerns.
An ABC News-Washington Post survey conducted from Sept. 28 through
Tuesday put the race at 51-44, with the Republican ticket in the
numerical lead.
   A Harris poll, conducted last week, gave the Republican ticket a
49-46 lead.
   However, the ABC-Post survey showed that 40 percent of the
people believed Quayle to be qualified to become vice president,
compared with 67 percent for Bentsen. The Harris survey said a
third believed Quayle to be qualified to be president if that
became necessary, and Bentsen beat Quayle 59-37 when voters were
asked their preference for vice president.
   The ABC-Post survey of 1,196 had an error margin of about four
points. The Harris survey Sept. 24-29 of 1,235 likely voters had an
error margin of three points.
   While Quayle's youth and his Vietnam-era service in the National
Guard have made him a controversial candidate, Bentsen has had to
fend off questions about the numerous differences between his own
moderate views and those of Dukakis.
   Quayle has said he was eager to prove himself to the viewing
voters.
   ``The American people don't know me,'' he said Tuesday as he
traveled to Omaha with a host of top Bush strategists, including
media adviser Roger Ailes. ``They have a lot of questions .... They
don't have any details of who Dan Quayle is.''
   Both men prepared carefully for the encounter, reading thick
briefing books, enduring sessions with their handlers and
participating in mock debates.
   Oregon Republican Sen. Bob Packwood played the role of Bentsen
in Quayle's practice sessions. Rep. Dennis Eckart of Ohio played
the role of Quayle for Bentsen's workouts.
   While presidential debates have become more or less a familiar
landmark on the campaign trail, televised vice presidential
encounters are rare.
   Only two previous such confrontations have been held, the first
one in 1976 between Democrat Walter F. Mondale and GOP Bob Dole,
and the second one four years ago between Bush and Democrat
Geraldine Ferraro.
   As the two vice presidential candidates squared off, the ad wars
continued.
   A new set of 30-second Dukakis ads to be aired nationally
starting Wednesday made a more direct attack on Bush and his record
on drug enforcement, education, the environment and Social
Security. The four ads said the administration dealt secretly with
Manuel Antonio Noriega, ``the Panamanian drug lord,'' Bush
``personally'' weakened environmental regulations, ``personally''
cast the tie-breaking vote to cut Social Security'' and ``sat by
while college loans for working families were cut.'''

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 14
Palestinians in street clashes Wednesday, Arab hospital officials
said, and the army reported two soldiers injured when a firebomb
hit their jeep in the occupied West Bank.
   Jerusalem police made a house-to-house searches of two Arab
neighborhoods for the second day in a row, looking for suspected
rioters, police spokesman Alex Lapidot said.
   The sweep, involving 150 policemen, was one of the largest in
Jerusalem since the Palestinian uprising began last Dec. 8.
   Nitham Abu Hawelah, 23, of the West Bank's Balata refugee camp,
died Wednesday after being hit by nine bullets in a clash with
troops more than a week ago, officials at Jerusalem's Mukassad
Hospital said.
   The fatality brought to 281 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. Six Israelis
also have died in the violence.
   An army spokesman said the two soldiers were hit by a firebomb
as they drove through Tulkarem. Israel television reported that one
trooper suffered moderate to serious burns while the other was
lightly injured.
   The army put a curfew on Tulkarem and started to comb the area.
   At least 14 people were arrested in Abu Tor and Silwan on the
southern outskirts of Jerusalem, and a police crackdown which
started late Tuesday was to continue until Thursday, police and
Israel television said.
   The detainees ``are suspected of participating in stone-throwing
incidents and other disturbances,'' Lapidot said.
   Among those arrested in Jerusalem was Ibrahim Hamde, a preacher
at Al Aqsa mosque, one of the holiest shrines of Islam. Israel
radio called him a radical religious leader and said he was
suspected of distributing underground leaflets.
   Silwan and the Arab sector Abu Tor have been major trouble spots
since the Palestinian uprising began. Both are part of Arab east
Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after the 1967 Middle East war.
   Lapidot said police also were searching for tax evaders in the
two neighborhoods. Underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising
have called on their followers to stop paying taxes to the Israeli
authorities.
   About a dozen Arabs were hustled out of their homes in pajamas
and handed court summonses for tax evasion, reporters at the scene
said.
   Troops shot and wounded nine Arabs, including an 11-year-old boy
and three teen-agers, in clashes in the West Bank city of Nablus,
Arab hospital officials said. One of the wounded, 16-year-old Jihad
Dib, was shot in the head and listed in critical condition at
Mukassad Hospital.
   The military command confirmed five casualties and said it was
investigating the other reports.
   In Balata, news of Hawelah's death sparked a stone-throwing riot
and the army clamped a curfew on the camp's 12,000 residents.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip's Beach refugee camp, soldiers
wounded five Arabs, three of them teenagers, Arab hospital
officials said.
   They said an 18-year-old was hit in the eye by a plastic bullet.
The army said it was checking the reports.
   Israeli troops detained Naela Ayesh, 28, a Palestinian employee
of the U.S.-based Save the Children organization in Gaza City, army
officials said. They gave no reason for the arrest.
   In another development, army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron
defended the use of plastic bullets at a closed-door meeting of the
parliamentary Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee, Israel radio
and newspapers reported.
   Shomron was quoted as saying the army was using the bullets to
stop riots before they got out of hand and to prevent fatalities.
   But the figures he presented seemed to contradict his claim.
Shomron told the legislators that in the last three weeks, since
the massive use of plastic bullets began, 11 Palestinians have been
killed and 267 wounded, compared with the previous three weeks in
which 10 Arabs were killed and 137 wounded.

   A former State Department employee denied
emphatically Wednesday an Iranian opposition leader's assertion
that he was involved in negotiating a release of American hostages
in Lebanon.
   In a statement released by the co-owner of his trade and
investment consulting firm here, Richard Lawless said: ``I
categorically deny and state for the record that I am involved
either directly or indirectly in any discussions or negotiations''
on the nine hostages.
   Former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said Tuesday in
Paris that Lawless had negotiated in behalf of Vice President
George Bush with a representative of Iranian Parliament Speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani, in an attempt to get American hostages
liberated.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater and State Department
spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley both denied that anyone had been engaged
in such negotiations with Iranians or Iranian government figures
under U.S. auspices or that Lawless is a government employee.
   ``He's not operating under our instruction or direction or
anything like that,'' Fitzwater said of Lawless. ``What is private
status is, I don't know.''
   Lawless was in his office Wednesday, but Therese Shaheen, a
co-owner of the business, spoke on his behalf in an interview.
   She said they felt Lawless' reputation ``had been harmed'' by
Bani-Sadr's allegations made after hostage Mithileshwar Singh, an
Indian-born U.S. resident, was released from 20 months of captivity
by pro-Iranian forces.
   Lawless said in the statement that ``I have never in my entire
life had any direct or indirect contact with any Iranian government
officials or any Iranian nationals claiming to represent the
Iranian government or any Iranian-related interests.''
   Bani-Sadr had said Lawless was attempting to negotiate the
release of the hostages on Bush's behalf. Last week, an Israeli
newspaper, The Nation, said U.S. government officials were engaged
in secret talks with Iranians in Geneva aimed at setting the
hostages free and improving relations between the United States and
Iran.
   Bani-Sadr also said a shipment of arms furnished by the United
States was destined for Iran.
   ``Those charges are not true,'' Fitzwater said. ``Bani-Sadr is
full of beans.''
   President Reagan and other administration officials have
repeatedly denied that any such direct talks are taking place, or
have taken place.
   Lawless, president of the consulting firm, U.S.-Asia, also said,
``I deny that I have any active relationship with anyone on the
staff of Vice President Bush or the Bush campaign organization
which relates in any way to this or any similar issue.''
   ``I have maintained this position in numerous discussions,'' he
said.
   Lawless worked for the CIA at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, South
Korea, between 1973 and 1975, the same years that Bush's national
security adviser, Donald Gregg, served for the CIA at that mission,
The Washington Times reported Wednesday.
   Gregg, however, has seen Lawless fewer than a half-dozen times
since 1975, and only in social settings, the newspaper quoted its
sources as saying.
   The New York Times, which also reported Wednesday that Lawless
had served in the U.S. Embassy in South Korea when Gregg was there,
quoted an unidentified former government official that Lawless had
worked in the CIA's operations directorate until several years ago.
   Spokesmen for Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, have
said that Lawless has no relationship with Bush or with the
election campaign.
   ``We never confirm or deny CIA allegations of employment,'' said
Bill Devine, a spokesman for the intelligence agency.
   Ms. Shaheen said that ``we showed Richard's passport, plane
tickets and so forth'' in an attempt to dissuade CBS News from
reporting his purported activities on behalf of the hostages, but
the network broadcast the report earlier this week.
   ``He couldn't possibly have been there'' taking part in any
discussions about the hostages, she said of Lawless. ``So Bani-Sadr
said he (Lawless) knows a couple people in the Bush campaign. ...
It was like, two and two make a thousand. ... We think it is
politically inspired by Iran.''
   Lawless is a former State Department employee, who was described
as an area analyst beginning in June 1972. He went to Seoul in
1973, according to a biographic register published by the
department.
   Ms. Shaheen said Lawless also had assignments at the U.S.
embassies in Vienna and Tokyo before founding the consulting
business.
   ``Primarily our business is in the Far East,'' she said, ``90
percent of it.''
   ``The story here is, why are the Iranians fabricating this
story,'' she said. ``Because that is the story here because they
have nothing to prove'' their allegations.
   ``It's the biggest hoax since ... whatever,'' she said.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Receptive to Honduran Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua expressed strong interest
Wednesday in a Honduran proposal for creation of an international
peace force to oversee the removal of Nicaraguan rebels from
Honduran territory.
   Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel D'Escoto, told The
Associated Press in an interview that he requested an urgent
meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and
Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras to discuss the
proposal.
   Lopez Contreras recommended in a speech to the General Assembly
Tuesday night that military forces from Canada, Spain and West
Germany be sent to Honduras to carry out the proposed mission.
   Lopez Contreras said the peace force would be asked to evict
Salvadoran rebels from Honduras, as well as the U.S.-supported
Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras.
   ``We would like to give him the benefit of the doubt,'' D'Escoto
said, adding that Honduras has made such proposals before but never
followed up on them.
   At least 10,000 Nicaraguan insurgents have settled along the
Honduran side of the country's border with Nicaragua since the U.S.
Congress suspended military aid to the rebels last February. They
depend on U.S. assistance for their survival.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said
the administration will give the Honduran proposal ``serious
consideration.''
   The Contras' use of Honduran territory as a springboard for
attacks inside Nicaragua has produced numerous cross-border clashes
between the two countries over the years.
   D'Escoto said he canceled plans to leave New York Thursday
morning so he can pursue the Honduran initiative. He said he is
willing to remain until a ``viable and acceptable request'' is made
to the United Nations by the secretary-general.
   He said Lopez Conteras made a similar proposal to the
Organization of American States last November but that Honduras did
not press the matter.
   The Reagan administration has said for years that military
pressure by the Contras is necessary to ensure democracy in
Nicaragua. The dismantling of the Contras would almost certainly
lead to the consolidation of the leftist Sandinista government and
to an escalation of its efforts to undermine its neighbors, the
administration has maintained.
   D'Escoto said Nicaragua has long favored establishment of a
verification commission to ensure that each Central American
country does not interfere with its neighbors.
   Lopez Contreras said in an interview with the AP earlier
Wednesday that even if a peace force is agreed to, it would
represent only a partial solution.
   He said one main source of Honduran concern is continued Soviet
military aid to the Sandinista government, which U.S. officials
have estimated at $400 million for the first eight months of 1988.
   ``We cannot stop the Soviets from supplying arms to the
Sandinistas,'' Lopez Contreras said. ``That is an issue that has to
be addressed by the United States.''
   He said that without a minimum of understanding between the
superpowers, ``It is going to be absolutely impossible to reach any
kind of settlement in Central America.''

   The government has tentatively settled a
lawsuit charging the CIA used nine Canadians as human guinea pigs
in mind-control research that included heavy doses of LSD, lawyers
in the case said Wednesday.
   The tentative out-of-court settlement, negotiated by attorneys
for the Canadians and the Justice Department, was announced on the
eve of trial at a hearing before U.S. District Judge John Garrett
Penn, who has presided over the case for eight years.
   Neither side would discuss the amount of the proposed
settlement, which is still subject to final approval by top-level
Justice Department officials. But sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the CIA agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of
$750,000.
   The proposed settlement amounts to ``a statement that every part
of our government is under the law, that no part of our government
is above the law,'' said James Turner, the plaintiffs' lead
attorney.
   ``This is a case of principle and that principle has been won
here,'' he added.
   The $9 million lawsuit claimed that CIA-financed research into
mind-control left permanent psychological or emotional damage on
the nine patients who underwent treatment in the late 1950s at the
Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University in Montreal.
   The research conducted by the institute's director, the late Dr.
Ewen Cameron, included week-long sleep induced by drugs, doses of
LSD and unusually intense electroshock therapy.
   Only two of the plaintiffs were given LSD during the period the
CIA financed Cameron's research. But Cameron gave the drug to
several others during other visits to the institute.
   All the patients underwent treatment that Yale University
psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton described in a deposition as
deviating from ``the standard and customary psychiatric therapies''
of the period.
   The treatments also included sensory deprivation and what
Cameron called ``psychic driving'' _ the repeated playing of
recorded messages into a patient's ear for 16 hours.
   Other experts deposed by lawyers in the case questioned the
effectiveness and safety of the treatments, but the government has
contended that Cameron's work was well within the accepted bounds
of professional conduct.
   The CIA began researching the effects of LSD and other
mind-altering substances in 1953 under Project MK-ULTRA to counter
brainwashing techniques believed to have been developed in the
Soviet Union and China.
   LSD was not then a well-known drug in the West and CIA officials
feared that Communist bloc nations would use it to alter the
behavior of American diplomats.
   The 1953 suicide of Dr. Frank Olson, who was among a group of
CIA and Army scientists who were given after-dinner liquors laced
with LSD, prompted the agency to conduct further research with
unwitting subjects under stricter medical controls.
   Two years later, the CIA founded the Society for the
Investigation of Human Ecology as a front to finance medical
research on unsuspecting subjects. Cameron received nearly $60,000
from the organization between 1957 and 1960.
   Stanford University psychiatrist Harvey Weinstein said his
82-year-old father, ``still remains a shadow of the man he was''
when he sought treatment for anxiety at Cameron's clinic.
   Once a ``very, dynamic, successful'' Montreal businessman, Lou
Weinstein came home from the hospital as ``somebody who doesn't
know who he is, or what he is or where he is,'' the son said in a
telephone interview.
   ``The man who came out of the hospital was a stranger,'' Dr.
Weinstein said.
   The elder Weinstein gradually improved but not until after he
sold his dress manufacturing business, said the psychiatrist, whose
book ``Father, Son and CIA'' was recently published in Canada.
   The government contended in court papers that Cameron did not
know he was receiving CIA money, though the plaintiffs argue that
he was aware of CIA interest and sought the research grants.
   An internal CIA investigation of Project MK-ULTRA in 1957
concluded that some of the research activities ``are considered to
be professionally unethical and in some instances border on the
illegal.''
   But the plaintiffs contend that the officials who supervised the
project were allowed to continue their work unsupervised and
unreprimanded despite this finding.
   The lawsuit was originally filed by nine plaintiffs, but earlier
this year Penn dismissed the claim of Dr. Mary Morrow because she
had filed her claim too late.
   But Turner said Morrow would receive a share of the settlement
with the remaining plaintiffs. Morrow was placed in the treatment
program after she had applied to Cameron for a research fellowship
at the institute.
   During the brief hearing before Penn, Assistant U.S. Attorney
John O. Birch stressed that the settlement was still subject to
negotiation pending final Justice Department approval.
   ``We are going to make a recommendation in the very near
future,'' Birch told Penn, who granted a request by both sides to
postpone Thursday's start of the trial to give the Justice
Department time to review the details of the tentative deal.
   ``It's a not over `til the fat lady sings situation, and she
hasn't sung, Birch said.
   But Turner told Penn: ``to say that it is till in negotiation is
not my understanding of the posture.'' The lawyer later told
reporters that he was assured that it was very unlikely the Justice
Department would reject the settlement.
   Turner praised CIA Director William Webster's ``very important''
role in reaching the agreement to settle the case.

   Lisa Marie Presley, who stands to inherit
millions from her father's estate, has wed a musician she dated for
three years, her publicist said Wednesday.
   The 20-year-old daughter of Elvis Presley wed Danny Keough, 23,
this week in a private ceremony at the Hollywood headquarters of
the Church of Scientology, said the publicist, Paul Bloch.
   ``In attendance were the mother of the bride, actress Priscilla
Beaulieu Presley, family and a few close friends,'' said Bloch, who
represents the mother and daughter. It was the first marriage for
each.
   ``I'm thrilled for Lisa Marie,'' said the mother of the bride.
``Danny is a great guy and I couldn't be happier for the two of
them.''
   The couple live in Los Angeles. Their honeymoon plans were not
disclosed.
   Presley died in 1977. His will stated that when his daughter
turns 25 she will inherit his estate, including his mansion,
Graceland, now a tourist attraction in Memphis, Tenn. The estate
was valued at $50 million in 1987.
   Bloch had no details on Keough's career and he wasn't listed
with the American Federation of Musicians Local 47, which covers
Southern California.

<TEXT>
   Military street patrols killed seven more
looters in Rangoon and Mandalay, bringing the number of people
slain since the Sept. 18 military coup to about 440, the state
radio reported Wednesday.
   Rangoon radio said the shootings occurred Tuesday. It and other
official media have described most of those killed since the coup
as looters or other ``destructive elements.''
   Soldiers are imposing strict rules against public gatherings and
looting. Vendors, gamblers and others who once crowded the
sidewalks of Rangoon have disappeared.
   Civil servants and factory workers reported to their jobs for
the third day but many left by early afternoon, apparently because
of a lack of work in ministries and state enterprises crippled by a
long general strike. All government employees were ordered back to
work Monday under threat of dismissal.
   Two new youth organizations, the People's Youth Federation and
the All Burma United Youth Organizations, registered as political
parties Wednesday with a commission that is to supervise elections.
The political leanings of the two groups were not immediately known.
   Three main opposition political parties have registered _ the
Democracy Party, National League for Democracy and People's
Democracy Party _ but have not said whether they will participate
in the elections.
   Burma's most powerful party, widely believed to be backed by the
new government, has not registered because of its ``complicated
position,'' party sources said Wednesday.
   The National Unity Party, under another name, was the only legal
party for 26 years of repressive military rule and operated with
government funds. It has been ordered to divest itself of
government assets like all other parties.
   Party sources said this would prove difficult because the
organization, formerly called the Burma Socialist Program Party,
had substantial holdings in real estate and other fixed assets
acquired all or in part from government funding.
   Under a Sept. 27 decree, political parties that use state funds,
vehicles and other property cannot apply for registration.
Financing for the Burma Socialist Program Party included $10
million to $13.3 million annually in government funds.
   Western diplomats say Gen. Saw Maung and his new government back
the National Unity Party but are observing legal requirements in an
attempt to quiet anti-government feelings.

   Police torpedoed a planned second day of sit-ins
and arrests at abortion clinics Wednesday by impounding a bus and
increasing security at clinics where 343 were arrested a day
earlier.
   Fourteen protesters were arrested, and at least three were
dragged to police vans. Most demonstrators, however, limited
activities to praying and singing hymns.
   City Solicitor Raines Carter said the 14 arrested Wednesday were
charged with giving a false name, unlawful assembly and refusing to
obey a police officer.
   Some of the protesters arrested Tuesday began posting bond
Wednesday after identifying themselves. Protest organizers have
encouraged those arrested to call themselves only ``Baby John Doe''
or ``Baby Jane Doe'' and remain in jail.
   The bus was impounded as it took demonstrators from a silent
vigil at one clinic to a demonstration at another.
   ``The officer determined (the bus) to be unsafe for operation.
When it was stopped there was smoke coming out and it was crowded
with too many people,'' said police spokeswoman Myrna May. She said
she did not know how many were aboard.
   Protesters on Tuesday complained that police treated them with
unnecessary harshness, twisting arms and fingers and using
pressure-point holds just under the ears to force them into buses.
   Some screamed or cried as they were taken away, and four were
treated for apparently minor injuries.
   George Napper, Atlanta commissioner of public safety, said he
believed there were isolated arrests ``in which police could have
acted more gently'' but that he thought the overall reaction was
justified.
   Demonstrators on Wednesday arrived gradually at the Feminist
Women's Health Clinic, where police arrested one for trying to jump
a barricade and two others for assaulting a woman trying to enter
the clinic, Maj. W.W. Holley said.
   About 50 police, including several on horses, were posted at the
small clinic.
   On Tuesday night about 75 people at an anti-abortion rally
stayed behind for tactical training and said they would take part
in Wednesday's action and face arrest, but fewer than that were in
evidence at the clinic.
   Joseph Foreman, a leader of Operation Rescue, which is
organizing a week of attempts to close Atlanta abortion clinics,
said demonstrators would try to cross police lines ``only if we see
a woman preparing to go in and kill her child.''
   He claimed the police lines kept women out. ``So there is no
need for us to risk arrest,'' he said.
   Lynne Randall, the clinic director, denied that the
demonstration is stopping abortions and said the protesters were
``acting like thugs.''
   She said several patients had arrived at the clinic. ``They
might postpone it,'' she said. ``Our appointment numbers are the
same, they are just distributed differently.'' She said the clinic
usually sees 10 to 50 patients a day.
   Around midday at least two women were ushered into the clinic.
Foreman contended both were actually employees trying to give the
impression that the clinic was operating.
   Police announced last week that they would use rougher tactics
on demonstrators this week than they did during the Democratic
National Convention in July, when Operation Rescue first organized
protests in Atlanta.
   During those demonstrations and several that followed during the
summer, more than 750 people were arrested. Hundreds refused to
identify themselves, making it impossible to free them on bond and
causing crowded jails.
   Many of the 360 jailed Tuesday used similar tactics.
   Napper said Wednesday's rougher arrests and an injunction
limiting demonstrators' activities were partly responsible for
Wednesday's low turnout.
   He said the department has had to pull officers from other
assignments and close the police academy and put recruits on the
job to protect the clinics.

<HEAD>IRA Bomb Fails To Detonate Under Prison Warden's Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prison warden and his wife
escaped an IRA assassination attempt Wednesday because a bomb
planted in the undercarriage of their car failed to explode.
   The attempt on Thomas Murtagh's life was made a day after Brian
Armour, 48, vice president of the Prison Officers Association, was
killed by an IRA bomb that blew up his car as he drove through
Protestant east Belfast.
   In a statement released to local media, the outlawed Irish
Republican Army said a 2-pound bomb did not explode as planned
while Murtagh, 46, and his wife drove away from their home in
Lisburn, 7 miles southwest of Belfast.
   It said when the Murtaghs parked the car in a shopping center
lot, attempts to detonate the explosive were abandoned ``to avoid
any danger to civilians.''
   ``Today, Murtagh was lucky,'' the statement said. ``He and his
cohorts will not always be so lucky.''
   The IRA accused Murtagh of ``repressive measures'' against Irish
nationalist prisoners and said he was responsible for the
strip-searching of female inmates when he ran Armagh prison in the
early 1980s.
   Police would not confirm that Murtagh, now warden of the
Hydepark center for young offenders in Belfast, was the target of
Wednesday's bomb. A spokesman said only that the late-model Honda
belonged to the wife of a prison officer.
   Murtagh and his wife were in a shopping center department store
at midday when a telephone caller told a radio station about the
bomb, the police spokesman said.
   A British army bomb squad destroyed the device in a controlled
explosion about 2{ hours later, he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``The terrorists must have been aware when they planted the
device that the vehicle could have been used by any member of the
family,'' the police spokesman said.
   The IRA is fighting to drive the British from Northern Ireland
and unite the predominately Protestant province with the Irish
Republic, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.
   Its statement claimed guerrillas got through tight security
around Murtagh's home to plant the bomb. The house is about 150
yards from a British army barracks.
   According to the IRA, the bombs planted Tuesday and Wednesday
contained an explosive made in Czechoslovakia called Semtex.
   Police believe the IRA obtained the lightweight, odorless
explosive through Libya. The explosive has featured prominently in
attacks this year on security forces and commercial targets.

<HEAD>3-year-old Boy Cleared in Shooting Death of Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old boy who shot and killed his father
as the man beat the child's mother said afterward he would have
done it again.
   ``I killed him,'' the boy reportedly said afterward. ``Now he's
dead. If he would have hit my mother, I would have shot him again.''
   Prosecutors said Tuesday they won't take any legal measures
against the child, who wasn't identified, because he couldn't have
acted intentionally.
   ``We feel that this is an act that a 3-year-old cannot
contemplate,'' Ron Schigur, head of the Wayne County Prosecutor's
Office juvenile division said Tuesday. ``I mean, he can't form any
kind of intent. ...
   ``There just doesn't seem to be any reason to pursue it.''
   The boy's mother, who spoke Tuesday on condition neither she nor
her son be identified, said, ``It was an accident; it just
happened.''
   The boy, now 4, shot and killed Sherwood Cannon, 47, on June 18.
The decision on what to do about the case was delayed pending the
results of toxicology tests, said assistant prosecutor David Wolock.
   The tests showed Cannon had a blood alcohol level of 0.08
percent at the time of the shooting, just above Michigan's legal
level of impairment.
   Detroit homicide detectives at first refused to believe the
youngster could have fired the gun. But they said gunpowder residue
tests showed the child was the only one in the room who did fire a
gun.
   The city's top homicide investigator, Inspector Gerald Stewart,
said it would be unusual for a toddler to have the strength to pull
a trigger. Stewart said detectives gave the boy the weapon
unloaded, asking him to show how he used it.
   ``We checked to see if that was possible,'' Stewart said. ``It
was.''
   According to the police report, Cannon and his 25-year-old
girlfriend, the boy's mother, were having a barbecue at their home
when the woman changed a musical tape Cannon had been playing.
   Cannon became angry, saying she was making a fool out of him,
the report said. He began grabbing and pushing the woman and went
and got a .25-caliber automatic he kept hidden from the children.
   The 3-year-old was among at least four children in the house who
were watching the late-night fight, the report said.
   Cannon walked into the room with the gun, but set it on a table,
saying he didn't need it. He then grabbed his girlfriend, threw her
to the floor and held her down as she yelled he was hurting her.
   A shot was fired and Cannon asked, ``Who got shot?''
   Then, he said, ``It's me.''
   Cannon fell over, mortally wounded in the back.
   Two other adults and three of the children in the room told
police the boy had picked up the gun, aimed it at his father and
fired.
   The boy's mother said Tuesday he had cried a little after the
shooting and then fell asleep for a while. That night at police
headquarters, the boy smiled and posed for a Polaroid photo that
homicide detectives often take of suspects. A detective let the boy
keep one.
   His mother said she considered counseling for her son,
especially after his pre-school teacher said he had been having
crying spells, but she didn't get around to it because the family
moved after the shooting.

<HEAD>Nearly 1,000 Kurdish Refugees Return To Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VEDAT ERDAMAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HABUR, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 1,000 Kurdish refugees returned to
Iraq on Wednesday as the deadline neared for a government amnesty,
two months after they fled to Turkey claiming Iraq dropped chemical
bombs on their settlements.
   The 966 Kurds were taken by bus and truck from a tent city in
Yuksekova to a border post in Habur and then across a bridge over
the Tigris River into Iraq.
   They were among 60,000 Kurds who flocked to five tent cities in
southeastern Turkey last August during an army offensive against
Kurdish rebels in the mountains of northeastern Iraq.
   Regional Gov. Hayri Kozakcioglu told a news conference another
group of Kurdish refugees, numbering 1,500, was due to be
transferred to Iraq Thursday. He said Iraq assured the Turkish
government the refugees will be safely settled back in the villages.
   Iraq on Sept. 6 proclaimed a ``general and comprehensive''
amnesty for the Kurds at the urging of Turkey. Iraq has said that
thousands accepted the amnesty, but only a few were confirmed to
have returned.
   The deadline for the amnesty is Thursday evening. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Inal Batu said Turkey is trying to persuade Iraq
to extend the amnesty period.
   Batu told reporters in Ankara the Kurdish refugees signed papers
saying they were returning home voluntarily under terms of the
amnesty.
   Returning refugees said that when they left their villages, the
danger was very real.
   ``When the Iraqi planes came to our villages dropping chemical
bombs, we had no other chance but to escape,'' said Eyup Seydu, a
38-year-old refugee. ``But I decided to go back after the amnesty.
I am not afraid, I have done nothing wrong.''
   Iraq has denied it used chemical weapons against the Kurds,
though it has acknowledged using such weapons in its 8-year-old war
with Iran.
   Suleyman Fettah, 61, who was returning to his village of Rekani
in northern Iraq with his 14-member family, said he never wanted to
leave his village and that Kurdish guerrillas ``forced us to flee.''
   The Wednesday group included 501 children and 245 women. The
refugees, carrying a few belongings such as blankets or mattresses,
looked exhausted after the 20-hour trip to the border aboard 16
buses and four trucks.
   Turkey initially asked the International Red Cross to supervise
the Kurds' return, but the Red Cross declined after Iraq refused to
grant its request for further guarantees on behalf of the refugees.
   The Kurds, 20 million people living in a region where the
borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq converge, have been fighting for
independence for the past century.
   The latest rebellion, led by Massoud Barzani, president of the
Kurdish Democratic Party, in alliance with Jamal Talabani's
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, tried to take advantage of the
Iran-Iraq war.
   But after an Aug. 20 cease-fire in the war, Iraq sent seasoned
troops against the Kurds.

   Canadian air chilled the upper Midwest on Wednesday and brought
wet, blustery weather to the Great Lakes region.
   Cold air flowing from the north over Lake Ontario produced
scattered showers and thunderstorms over western New York state.
Small hail pelted Oswego, and pea-sized hail was reported near
Saratoga Springs.
   Showers fell along the southern shores of Lake Erie in northwest
Pennsylvania and the southern shores of Lake Michigan. Rain showers
mixed with light snow over upper Michigan. Light rain dampened
Oklahoma and southern Kansas.
   Thunderstorms formed over northern Arizona, southern Utah and
southern Nevada, and showers and thunderstorms also were over
central Colorado and along the Atlantic Coast of Florida.
   Heavier rainfall in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly half an inch at Tulsa, Okla., and a third of an inch at
Mcconnell Air Force Base, at Wichita, Kan.
   Temperatures dipped to the middle 30s in Illinois Tuesday night,
and were in the 30s Wednesday afternoon in parts of Minnesota,
Kansas and Nebraska.
   Frost or freeze advisories were issued for Wednesday night in
Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. Ohio and the northern
and central Appalachians were warned to expect a freeze, and
Kentucky frost.
   By contrast, temperatures were in the 70s in the south half of
Texas, the Gulf Coast region, northern Florida, eastern parts of
the southern Atlantic Coast states, inland northern California and
the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah. Temperatures in the 80s
were recorded in southern Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 37
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 99 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
   Several cities had record low temperatures for the date
Wednesday morning, including 31 at Burlington, Iowa; 34 at Calico
Rock, Ark.; 24 at Eau Claire, Wis., 35 at Harrison, Ark.; 34 at
Kansas City, Mo.; 26 at Norfolk, Neb.; 31 at Ottumwa, Iowa; 26 at
Sioux City, Iowa; 24 at Waterloo, Iowa; and 25 at Yankton, S.D.
   Thursday's forecast called for showers scattered in northern
Maine, western New York, eastern Oklahoma and southwest Missouri.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms were expected in southern
Florida, Arizona and Utah. Cloudy skies were predicted in the
middle Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 40s in the northern
Great Lakes, the lower Great Lakes, most of New York state and
northern New England; the 70s and 80s in southeast Washington,
Oregon, along the Pacific Coast, northern and central California,
the northern and central Intermountain region west of the central
Rockies, the southern Rockies, Texas except the Panhandle, the Gulf
Coast region, Florida and southern Georgia. Temperatures should be
between 90 and 105 degrees in the desert Southwest and inland
valleys of southern California. The remainder of the nation should
have highs in the 50s and 60s.

<HEAD>`Choctaw Kid' Who Survived 1946 Alcatraz Breakout Attempt Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clarence Carnes, a career criminal who
gained notoriety for a failed escape attempt from Alcatraz in 1946
that resulted in seven deaths, has died in prison here. He was 61.
   Officials at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners said
Wednesday that a preliminary autopsy revealed complications
relating to kidney problems that could have led to Carnes' death
Monday.
   At age 18, Carnes, who had the nickname ``Choctaw Kid,'' became
the youngest prisoner ever incarcerated at Alcatraz, the now-closed
federal prison on an island in San Francisco Bay, in 1945.
   The next year he was drawn into a daring escape plot that
quickly went awry. Two guards were killed and several were wounded.
The six inmates who participated got control of little more than
one cell house.
   Marines on their way home from Okinawa helped prison guards from
as far away as Leavenworth, Kan., retake the prison.
   When it was over, three prisoners were dead. Two others, Miran
Edgar Thompson and Sam Shockley, were later executed. Carnes was
spared the death penalty because he refused to murder several
guards he was assigned to kill.
   Carnes spent the next six years in a cell adjoining Robert
Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud had donated $200 to the
defense fund for Carnes, Shockley and Thompson from royalties from
his book, ``Digest of Bird Diseases.''
   Carnes was born to impoverished Indian parents in Oklahoma. He
committed his first crime at age 8, stealing candy bars at school.
   In 1943 he was sentenced to life in prison after he pleaded
guilty to murdering an Oklahoma service station attendant during a
holdup.
   Carnes was released to federal parole on Dec. 21, 1973. He lived
in the Kansas City area after that, but his parole was revoked
twice for minor infractions, mostly because of a drinking problem.
He was to be released from prison again next month.

   A man was in custody Wednesday charged
with abducting and raping two mentally disabled boys whom he took
on a five-day trip around central Florida, tying them to beds to
keep them from escaping.
   The desperate families had been distributing fliers and even
consulting a psychic in their efforts to find the boys, ages 13 and
14.
   ``I was so relieved,'' said the mother of the 13-year-old Port
St. Lucie boy. ``So much time had elapsed. I thought for sure they
were dead.''
   John Halpin, 31, was arrested Tuesday and jailed without bail on
charges of sexual battery and false imprisonment.
   The boys disappeared Sept. 29 after they decided not to ride the
school bus home from their school for mentally disabled children.
   Halpin allegedly picked them up with promises of a motorcycle
and a stereo.
   He released them Monday, according to Indian River County
sheriff's Capt. Larry Tippins.

   A police recruit who needed a liver
transplant after collapsing during rigorous training was showing
signs of emerging from a coma, his family said Wednesday.
   Pittsfield Mayor Ann Everest Wojtkowski said the family of
Timothy Shepard told her the 25-year-old Pittsfield police cadet
had been able to recognize his mother and pregnant wife and respond
to questions by shaking his head.
   Asked whether he was out of the coma, sister-in-law Becky
Shepard told The Associated Press: ``It's hard to say, it's a slow
process coming out of a coma,'' She added, ``there are signs that
he's coming out though.''
   Spokesmen at the Pittsburgh hospital where Shepard is being
treated would only say that Shepard remains in critical condition
after undergoing a liver transplant last week.
   The mayor said doctors have been able to remove Shepard from a
respirator for brief periods.
   A total of 16 cadets were hospitalized for dehydration and
exhaustion after Shepard collapsed on the first day of training,
Sept. 19.
   The Agawam academy was closed on the third day of training and
classes were moved until the drinking water could be checked. It
was found untainted, and all the cadets except Shepard have since
been released from hospitals.
   State Police Lt. William J. Shea, one of two state troopers who
took over the class this week after the original state police
instructors requested reassignment during the investigations,
described the morale of the cadets as ``pretty good under the
circumstances.'' But he said the classes were constantly being
interrupted by investigators from the attorney general's office.
   A task force assembled by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis also is
preparing to launch an inquiry into training at regional police
academies, as is a special 11-member state House committee.
   John Callahan, a former district attorney and past president of
the Massachusetts Bar Association chosen to head the governor's
board, said his group of legislators, police officials and doctors
would first meet Thursday.
   Callahan said he expected the focus of the inquiry would be the
physical and psychological training given recruits at the Agawam
academy and the state's six other regional police academies.
   State health officials and others have blamed extended exercise
without adequate water for the hospitalization of nearly one-third
of the recruits in the class.

<HEAD>High Court Clears Way For November Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN WILDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court cleared the way
Wednesday for democratic elections to be held in Pakistan on Nov.
16.
   Benazir Bhutto's opposition Pakistan People's Party is widely
expected to win at least a simple majority in any freely held
elections.
   The court removed the last hurdle in the way of scheduled
elections this November by blocking a move to reconvene the
National Assembly dissolved by the late President Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq.
   In a unanimous decision, it upheld a lower court ruling last
week that Zia's move in May was unconstitutional, but also found no
grounds to restore to power the old Muslim League government of
Prime Minister Mohammed Khan Junejo.
   The high court said in a statement that while its findings might
imply that the Junejo government stands revived, ``We are not
unmindful of the fact that the whole nation is geared up for
elections and we do not propose to do anything which makes
confusion ... which would be the result if the vital process of
election is interrupted at this juncture.''
   Mohammed Khan Naqshbandi, a spokesman for the Muslim League,
said Junejo and other party leaders would abide by the decision and
would drop their demands to reinstate the former Cabinet and
reconvene the legislature.
   ``Our position has been vindicated that Zia's decision to
dissolve the National Assembly was unconstitutional, illegal and
uncalled for,'' he said.
   It was the second time this week that the high court ruled
against the late military strongman. Zia and several of his top
generals were killed in a plane crash on Aug. 17.
   The Supreme Court ruled Sunday in favor of a petition by Ms.
Bhutto challenging Zia's July decree that the elections in November
be on a non-party basis. The court said the constitution guaranteed
that candidates could run on party tickets, rather than as
individuals under Zia's plan.
   The last democratic elections, held in 1973, swept Ms. Bhutto's
father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, into power as Pakistan's first
popularly elected prime minister.
   Bhutto was deposed by Zia in a military coup in 1977. Zia had
him hanged two years later.
   Zia ruled under martial law until 1985, when he allowed
elections on a non-party basis. The opposition boycotted the voting
and candidates favoring the pro-Zia Muslim League swept the
elections.
   Zia shared power with the Junejo government for three years,
then stunned the nation by abruptly firing the prime minister and
his Cabinet on May 29 and dissolving the National Assembly. Zia
accused them of corruption, incompetence and of failing to
implement his program of Islamization.
   Junejo denied the charges and called Zia's move illegal and
``arbitrary.''
   Zia scheduled elections for mid-November on a non-party basis.
   After his death, Zia, Senate chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan assumed
the presidency and pledged that the elections would proceed on
schedule. He left it to the courts to decide whether the polls
should be open to political parties.
   The Federal Election Commission has announced that voting for
the National Assembly will be held Nov. 16 and for provincial
assemblies three days later.
   The commission estimates that about 46 million of Pakistan's 107
million people are eligible to vote.

   Federal officials acted Wednesday to reduce peak
air traffic at O'Hare International Airport in reaction to a report
that mistakes by controllers there this year are already more than
double the number in 1987.
   Controllers at O'Hare made two errors Friday, another Sunday and
another Tuesday, bringing the number of recorded mistakes at O'Hare
this year to 30, said Don Zochert, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Chicago.
   In all four cases, planes were allowed to get too close to each
other, officials said. No one was injured.
   Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport has had six errors
this year, and Washington's National Airport two, officials said.
   In 1987, there were 12 errors by air traffic controllers at
O'Hare, which has been the subject of an investigation by the
National Transportation Safety Board, Zochert said. The airport is
one the world's busiest.
   ``I can't explain the reason (for the errors),'' Zochert said.
``That's the question everybody wants the answer to and if there
was an easy solution we'd have it.''
   Late Wednesday, the FAA called a news conference to say flights
to Chicago would sit on the ground in the cities where they
originate when there is too much traffic over O'Hare, spokeswoman
Barbara Dettmer said.
   During peak periods _ usually between 4:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. _
the maximum number of planes allowed to depart and land would be
reduced to about 155 per hour from 180, Ms. Dettmer said.
   The latest incidents came just two months after the safety board
issued a report saying that chronic understaffing, mandatory
overtime, outdated equipment and inadequate training had
contributed to mistakes at O'Hare.
   Despite the rise in mistakes, O'Hare remains a safe airport,
Zochert said.
   Michael Benson, a spokesman for the NTSB in Washington, said the
board met with FAA officials Wednesday to discuss the ``new rash of
operational errors. We got a positive feeling the FAA will be
taking steps.''
   In Tuesday's incident, a United Airlines jet and a smaller
Simmons Airlines plane came within 500 feet of each other while
approaching O'Hare, he said.
   On Sunday, two United jets came within 500 feet of each other
after the pilot of one plane apparently followed an order intended
for the other.
   On Friday, two Air Wisconsin jets came near each other when a
controller apparently mistakenly gave one of them an order to
descend, the FAA said.
   In a second incident Friday, an American Airlines jet and a
Delta Air Lines jet came within 400 feet vertically and a mile
horizontally when the pilot of the American jet apparently failed
to repeat an order to reduce speed and the controller did not seek
confirmation, the FAA said.
   The FAA requires airplanes in the area to be separated a minimum
of three miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   Joe Bellino, regional representative of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, said O'Hare's radar room on Friday was ``a
zoo.''
   With Friday's 3,842 takeoffs and landings _ just below the
all-time record of 3,853 set the day before _ there should have
been 18 journeyman controllers and several ``developmental''
controllers on duty. Developmental controllers have fewer
responsibilities than the journeymen.
   But Bellino said there were only 14 controllers working and the
problem was made worse when the controllers who made the errors
were temporarily relieved of their duties, giving those who
remained even more responsibilities.
   The FAA could not immediately say how many controllers were on
duty Friday, but Zochert said the number of controllers working at
the airport has risen from 87 last year to 94 as of Sept. 1.

<HEAD>New Chief Ideologist Charts Middle Course In Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Soviet chief ideologist appeared to chart
a middle course in the first major speech since he was elected to
the ruling Soviet Politburo, voicing support for reform as well as
for strong central authority.
   Vadim A. Medvedev's speech to an international conference on
contemporary socialism was made Tuesday and reprinted Wednesday by
the government newspaper Izvestia. The speech appeared to show some
slight differences from the beliefs of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Medvedev, a political economist, was named a member of the
Politburo on Friday by the policy-making Central Committee. He also
was named to head a party commission on ideology, indicating he
also assumed the ideology portfolio once held by Yegor K. Ligachev.
   Ligachev is widely believed to favor a more conservative
approach to social problems than Gorbachev. Medvedev's speech
appeared to stake out a middle ground, balancing the need for
reform with maintenance of political authority.
   ``We proceed from the fact that the socialist economy is
impossible without the strong role of the center,'' Medvedev, 59,
told the conference.
   He also seemed to say the criticism allowed by Gorbachev's drive
for greater openness, or ``glasnost,'' had gone too far.
   ``Unfortunately, there have been some irresponsible attempts to
cast a shadow over Lenin's inheritance, over the basic values of
socialism,'' Medvedev said.
   ``And how else can those statements appearing in the press be
interpreted that claim that the command-administrative system
resulted from Lenin, those attempts to deny the socialist nature of
our system, that even doubt the rightness of our choice for
socialism?''
   Medvedev did, however, say socialism now faces the need for
``deep qualitative rejuvenation.''
   In his 3{ years since becoming Communist Party chief, Gorbachev
has often mentioned the common interests of the West and the
socialist camp. Medvedev, however, said it was ``outdated'' to
maintain capitalism and socialism were developing on a parallel
course.
   ``Certainly, there could not be any merging, any convergence of
the two systems,'' the new Politburo member said. ``Each will
develop in accordance with its own rules.''

<HEAD>20 Injured In Campus Violence; Guerrillas Slay Three</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>

   Twenty people, including journalists, police
and students, were wounded by rocks and buckshot Wednesday during
protests at Peru's largest university, school officials and
witnesses said.
   Meanwhile in the Andes highland city of Ayacucho, police said
leftist guerrillas slit the throats of two men and shot a woman to
death for their alleged collaboration with government forces.
   University of San Marcos officials, students and reporters at
the disturbance said the injuries occurred as dozens of riot police
fired tear gas and buckshot to disperse 300 campus protesters. The
protesters in turn threw rocks at police.
   At least 60 demonstrators were taken away by police in paddy
wagons. Police refused to discuss the confrontation.
   A Peruvian photographer for the British news agency Reuters and
a cameraman for Viznews, a television news service, received minor
injuries when they were hit with buckshot fired by police, Reuters
said.
   An Associated Press photographer said he saw several police and
students wounded in a ``hail of rocks and buckshot'' during the
second straight day of campus disturbances at San Marcos, Peru's
largest university with about 45,000 students. The university is
four miles west of downtown.
   San Marcos Rector Jorge Campos said protests increased after the
school announced last week that it might have to close due to a
lack of operating funds.
   Campos said the government, which recently imposed austerity
measures to combat severe economic woes, has not responded to the
school's request for $5.2 million in funding.
   A column of Shining Path rebels late Monday raided Muyurina, a
farming village outside Ayacucho, and executed the three during a
kangaroo trial in the central plaza.
   Police said villagers were forced to witness the slayings.
   The Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that has waged an
insurgency for eight years, has executed hundreds of highland
peasants amid similar mock trials to punish suspected government
collaborators and scare other peasants from acting against the
rebellion, officials say.
   The impoverished farmland surrounding Ayacucho, 225 miles
southeast of Lima, was the birthplace and remains the stronghold of
the Shining Path. The fighting has spread throughout the central
Andes, down to the populated coast and into the eastern jungle,
claiming at least 12,000 lives.

   A man living in an apartment complex killed
his downstairs neighbor Wednesday by accidentally firing a pistol
through the floor, police said. The victim was shot in the chest
while lying in bed.
   William Howard Tate, 43, fired his .45-caliber automatic without
realizing it was loaded, police said.
   ``It's like the old saying that more people have been killed
with unloaded guns than with loaded guns,'' said Sgt. Will
Beechinor.
   Beechinor said Tate was showing the weapon to his wife the night
before. When he awoke in the morning, he noticed the gun was
half-cocked.
   He pulled the hammer back to let it down and the gun fired,
Beechinor said.
   The shooting was ruled accidental by the Travis County medical
examiner, Beechinor said.
   The victim's identity was not immediately released.

<HEAD>Rebels Attack Three Colombian Towns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas firing antitank
rockets and submachine guns attacked three northeastern towns
Wednesday and captured 18 policemen, a police colonel and a mayor's
office said.
   Three people died and 15 were wounded during the attacks on the
towns of Puerto Wilches, San Pablo and Cantagallo.
   The attacks came as Colombia's largest labor union, the Unified
Workers' Central, launched a series of marches to protest low
wages, inflation and right wing death squads that have killed more
than 100 labor leaders in the last two years.
   The army said in a communique that it raided suspected guerrilla
hideouts in five cities and foiled guerrilla plans to set off bombs
in the cities.
   The statement gave no further details about the reported raids
in Bogota, the capital, and in the cities of Medellin, Cali,
Bucarmanaga and Neiva.
   Armored personnel carriers and army jeeps mounted with machine
guns patroled streets in the five cities Wednesday.
   A total of about 300 guerrillas belonging to the Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces and the National Liberation Army
attacked the three towns, police Col. Luis Enrique Montenegro said
in a broadcast interview with the Bogota radio station Caracol.
   The strongest attack came in Puerto Wilches, where guerrillas
destroyed the police station with shoulder-fired rockets, said
Montenegro, who heads the national police force in the northeast
state of Santander.
   Two policemen were wounded and a woman caught in the crossfire
died of a heart attack, the colonel said. Two civilians were
wounded, he said.
   Two guerrillas were killed and seven were wounded in the
fighting in Puerto Wilches, the colonel said. The town is 185 miles
northeast of the capital of Bogota.
   In San Pablo 18 policemen were captured after officers ran out
of ammunition in an attack on their headquarters, an unidentified
employee with the mayor's office said in a broadcast interview with
the Bogota radio station RCN.
   San Pablo is 200 miles northeast of the capital.
   In Cantagallo, near Puerto Wilches, four soldiers were wounded,
Montenegro said.

   Leander Perez Jr., the former district
attorney who lost his father's legacy of power in Plaquemines
Parish in fights with his brother, died Wednesday of a heart
attack. He was 68 years old.
   ``He was brought into the Meadowcrest Hospital emergency room by
ambulance in critical condition and he died at the hospital,'' said
hospital spokeswoman Ann Wilder.
   Perez, who lived in New Orleans, apparently suffered the heart
attack during a business meeting at Idlewild Plantation, the family
estate in Belle Chasse, said A.R. Johnson, a close friend of Perez.
   Perez was a son of the fervent segregationist who built one of
the most dominant political machines in Southern history _ ruling
Plaquemines for more than four decades, first as district attorney
and later as Commission Council president.
   Before he died in 1969, Judge Leander Perez _ so known because
he had briefly held an appointed federal judgeship at the start of
his political career _ saw Leander Jr. anointed as district
attorney and his other son, Chalin, as council president.
   Leander Jr., who first became district attorney in 1960, did not
run in 1984. He never announced his decision or said why he made
it. He reportedly had been hospitalized that year for circulation
problems.
   Perez also had serious political troubles since he and Chalin
had begun feuding in the late 1970s, and in 1979 Leander Perez
began investigating the parish council.
   A grand jury indicted Chalin Perez in 1981 on charges of misuse
and abuse of parish property and finances. The panel was dismissed
later that year, just as it was about to indict the district
attorney and the family-owned Delta Development Corp. on charges of
stealing millions of dollars in mineral royalties from parish-owned
lands.
   Perez and former state District Judge Eugene Leon were indicted
on malfeasance charges because of that dismissal, but were
acquitted in February 1986.
   Chalin Perez was ousted as parish president in 1983, the same
year that a lawyer unearthed an old legal document revealing that
Judge Perez had secretly acquired control of parish lands in the
1930s.
   The parish sued the Perezes, but two courts ruled that the
parish had filed its lawsuit 33 years too late.
   Those courts eventually were overruled by the state Supreme
Court, and the parish dropped $80 million in claims against the
family in September 1987 for about $12 million and control of the
oil-rich lands, on which it expects to earn $3 million a year.
   Perez is survived by his wife, Aphra, whom he married after the
death of his first wife, Catherine; four children, and their
children.

   Two gunmen held at least eight
customers hostage for an hour at a bank in this Pacific coast town
Wednesday but released them when police entered the building, a
state police official said.
   No one was injured and the two would-be robbers were arrested,
said Joel Velazco Flores, a state police commander.
   ``They didn't have time to get the loot,'' Velazco Flores said.
   He said the men, armed with pistols, entered the Banoro bank
shortly after 9 a.m. (noon EDT) and held from eight to 10 of the
customers, ``whoever they wanted,'' next to the vault. An
undetermined number of other people also were in the bank, he said.
   About 50 state, city and federal police and highway patrolmen
surrounded the block where the bank is located, he said. Then 20 to
25 of them entered through different doors, using a megaphone to
urge the assailants not to shoot, he said.
   ``They obeyed,'' Velazco Flores said.
   He identified those arrested as Francisco Lopez, 22, and Paulino
Paredes Quintero, 23, both of Los Mochis.
   In April, six heavily armed men took more than 42 hostages in a
24-hour siege in Los Mochis at a branch of the National Bank of
Mexico. Five people were killed and 15 wounded.
   Unconfirmed reports said those robbers took about $13,000 from
the bank, but officials would not confirm the amount. After
releasing the hostages, the gunmen were allowed to leave in an
armored car but were later arrested.

   Here is the text of Wednesday night's debate
between vice presidential candidates Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
and Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind.
   Moderator: Good evening. On behalf of the Commission on
Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this vice
presidential debate. I'm Judy Woodruff of PBS's MacNeil@Lehrer News
Hour and Frontline. My colleagues on the panel are Jon Margolis of
the Chicago Tribune, Tom Brokaw of NBC News, and Brit Hume of ABC
News.
   The importance of tonight's debate is underscored by two facts:
both George Bush and Michael Dukakis said their selection of a
running mate would reveal a lot about themselves; and, based on the
history since World War II, there is almost a 50-50 chance that one
of the two men here tonight will become president of the United
States. The candidates are Senator Dan Quayle, the Republican
nominee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic nominee. For the
next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates following a
format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two
campaigns. However, there are no restrictions on the questions that
my colleagues and I may ask this evening. By prior agreement
between the two candidates, the first question goes to Senator
Quayle, and you have two minutes to respond.
   Senator, you have been criticized, as we all know, for your
decision to stay out of the Vietnam War, for your poor academic
record. But more troubling to some are some of the comments that
have been made by people in your own party. Just last week, former
Secretary of State Haig said that your pick was the dumbest call
George Bush could have made. Your leader in the Senate, your leader
in the Senate, Bob Dole, said that a better qualified person could
have been chosen. Other Republicans have been far more critical in
private. Why do you think that you have not made a more substantial
impression on some of these people who have been able to observe
you up close?
   Quayle: The question goes to whether I am qualified to be vice
president and, in the case of a tragedy, whether I'm qualified to
be president. Qualifications for the office of vice president or
president are not age alone. We must look at accomplishments, and
we must look at experience. I have more experience than others that
have sought the office of vice president. Now let's look at
qualifications, and let's look at the three biggest issues that are
going to be confronting America in the next presidency. Those three
issues are national security and arms control, jobs and education,
and the federal budget deficit. On each one of those issues I have
more experience than does the governor of Massachusetts.
   In national security and arms control you have to understand the
relationship between a ballistic missile, a warhead, what
throw-weight, what mega-tonnage is; you better understand about
telemetry and encryption; and you better understand that you have
to negotiate from a position of strength. These are important
issues because we want to have more arms control and arms
reductions.
   In the area of jobs and education, I wrote the Job Training
Partnership Act, a bi-partisan bill -- a bill that has trained and
employed over three million economically disadvantaged youth and
adults in this country. On the area of federal budget deficit, I
have worked eight years on the Senate Budget Committee, and I wish
that the Congress would give us the line-item veto, to help deal
with that. And if qualifications alone are going to be the issue in
this campaign, George Bush has more qualifications than Michael
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen combined.
   Moderator: Senator Bentsen, Senator Bentsen. I'm going to
interrupt at this point and ask once again that the audience please
keep your responses as quiet as possible. We know that many of you
here are for one candidate or another, but you are simply taking
time away from your candidate, and more likely than not, you'll be
causing the partisans for the other candidate to react again on _
when their candidate speaks _ so please. Senator Bentsen, you have
one minute to respond.
   Bentsen: This debate tonight, is not about the qualifications
for the vice presidency. The debate is whether or not Dan Quayle
and Lloyd Bentsen are qualified to be president of the United
States. Because Judy, just as you have said, that has happened too
often in the past. And if that tragedy should occur, we have to
step in there without any margin for error, without time for
preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in
the world _ that of running this great country of ours. To take
over the awesome responsibility for commanding the nuclear weaponry
that this country has. No, the debate tonight, is a debate about
the presidency itself, and a presidential decision that has to be
made by you. The stakes could not be higher.

   Q: Senator Bentsen -- a question for you, and you also have two
minutes to respond. What -- while this -- is not so much your
qualifications, but your split on policy with Governor Dukakis. He
has said that he does not want a clone of himself, but you disagree
with him on some major issues -- aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, the
death penalty, gun control, among others. If you had to step in to
the presidency, who's agenda would you pursue? Yours, or his?
   Bentsen: Well, I'm delighted to respond to that question,
because we agree on so many things, and the vast majority of the
issues. We agree on the fact that we have to cut this deficit, and
Governor Dukakis has been able to cut that deficit ten budgets in a
row in the State of Massachussetts, while he lowered the tax burden
on their people from one of the highest to one of the lower in the
United States. That is a major sense of achievement, and I admire
that. And I'm just delighted to be on the ticket with him. Governor
Dukakis and I agree that we ought to have a trade policy for this
country, that we've seen this administration more than double the
national debt, that they've moved this country from the number one
lender nation in the world to the number one debtor nation in the
world under their administration, that they have not had a trade
policy, that they've let trade be a handmaiden for the foreign
policy objectives of the country, that this country has exported
too many jobs and not enough products.
   And as I worked to pass a trade bill through the United States
Senate, they threw roadblocks in the way every step of the way, but
we passed a trade bill that has this premise: that any country that
has full access to our markets, we're entitled to full access to
their markets. Now, that means that we're going to stand tough for
America, and we're going to protect those jobs, and we're going to
push American products, and we're going to open up markets around
the world. We'll show leadership in that respect and turn this
deficit in trade around. That's the sort of thing that Michael
Dukakis and I will do to bring about a better America for all of
our people.
   Q: Senator Quayle, a minute to respond.
   Quayle: As you noticed, Senator Bentsen didn't tell you very
much about what Governor Dukakis would do _ Governor Dukakis, one
of the most liberal governors in the United States of America. The
one thing he tried to point out about Governor Dukakis is that he's
cut taxes. The fact of the matter is, Senator Bentsen, he's raised
taxes five times. He just raised taxes this last year, and that's
why a lot of people refer to him ``Tax Hike Mike.'' That's why they
refer to the state of Massachusetts as Taxachusetts. Because every
time there's problem the liberal governor from Massachusetts raises
taxes. I don't blame Senator Bentsen for not talking about Governor
Michael Dukakis; he's talking more about his record. If I had to
defend the liberal policies of Governor Michael Dukakis, I wouldn't
talk about it either.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Wife `Imagined' Her Brother Had AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Dornan said his wife's
mistaken public statement that her brother suffered from AIDS was
prompted by worry and imagination, according to a newspaper report
published Wednesday.
   Dornan and his wife, Sallie, are ``very relieved and obviously
extremely happy,'' that her estranged brother, Doug Hansen, doesn't
have the disease, Dornan told the Orange County Register in an
interview.
   The comments from Dornan, a Republican who has been critical of
the gay lifestyle, apparently did little to end an unusual and
highly public family feud.
   At a public meeting Sept. 18, Mrs. Dornan vividly described the
plight of a brother dying of AIDS as she was apologizing for
shouting, ``Shut up, fag,'' to a gay activist in the crowd. Asked
who the brother was, she said, ``Dougie.''
   Dornan criticized his brother-in-law, a 51-year-old landscape
architect from San Diego, for discussing the matter with the news
media.
   Hansen in interviews denied that he is gay and that he suffered
from the fatal malady. The congressman said his wife believed it
wrong for her brother to go public with his rebuttal of her
assertions.
   ``She thinks Doug owes her an apology for going to the press
instead of her,'' Dornan said.
   Dornan, seeking re-election to a third term in Congress, said
the description stemmed from his wife's worries about her brother
and from pictures she had seen of AIDS victims.
   ``She'd been worrying and it came out as a reality instead of a
fear _ that's the one mistake Sallie made,'' Dornan said.
   ``Sallie is just a walking heart,'' Dornan said. ``I think she
had imagined this so often, she thought she had seen them.''
   Hansen later called reporters to deny he had AIDS. Though he has
friends who are homosexual, he said, he belives the gay lifestyle
is wrong.
   Hansen tested negative for the AIDS virus in a test arranged by
the Los Angeles Times.
   Hansen said he hadn't seen his sister since their mother's
funeral in 1983, and Dornan said he has seen Hansen only once in 30
years.

   Scientists, scholars, writers and artists from
countries with restricted freedom of expression will work at 15
American colleges under a program established by the Ford
Foundation, sponsors said Wednesday.
   Miklos Haraszti, a dissident writer from Hungary, arrived at
Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson in September, becoming the
first fellow of the International Academy for Scholarship and the
Arts.
   The Ford Foundation has given a $100,000 grant to establish the
program, said Leon Botstein, president of Bard College, which will
serve as its administrator.
   The fellows will reside for at least one academic year at the
American colleges, pursuing their work while teaching.
   ``Serious and gifted scholars and artists from all over the
world who need the opportunity to think, study, investigate and
write without restriction will be served,'' said Botstein. ``In
return, our students, faculty and staff can only benefit by their
presence.''
   The sponsors said applicants for the fellowship will most likely
be among three categories:
   _Emigrant artists and intellectuals who are living in Europe or
the United States but who are unemployed or underemployed.
   _Individuals who seek to leave their homeland, perhaps
permanently, as a matter of conscience.
   _Individuals who would like to come to the United States but who
intend to return to their homeland, despite any political or
economic pressures that may await them.
   The program also will include Dartmouth College in Hanover,
N.H.; Davidson College in Davidson, N.C.; Vassar College in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; St. Augustine College in Raleigh, N.C.; Lincoln
University in Oxford, Pa.; and nine other schools not yet chosen.

   George Bush on Wednesday proposed a $3.9 billion
``invest in our children'' plan focusing on school programs and
environmental and quality-of-life issues Bush said will foster
stronger children through ``a family that functions and an
environment that motivates.''
   The package, including some proposals Bush has made before,
would be aimed at helping poor people through tax code revisions
and Medicaid efforts, and would also include anti-crime and
anti-gang sections as well as efforts to remove toxic substances
from school environments.
   A 32-page summary released by the Republican's presidential
campaign also includes proposals to require Medicaid coverage for
poor children and to give the states $10 million for developing
programs against hazardous radon gas.
   Bush called for a national survey of schools in 1990 to detect
and get rid of radon, and also for ``strict standards'' covering
manufacturers who use lead in development of consumer products.
   Although Bush said in a remark at a Arapahoe High School that
``I don't see this problem in terms of money,'' campaign adviser
Deborah Steelman said the entire package would cost about $3.9
billion in federal money for the first year of a five-year plan.
   Included in that figure is a previously announced $2.2 billion
tax credit program for child care. Steelman said the new Medicaid
proposals would amount to some $300 million.
   ``Why are some children still in trouble after 50 years of
liberal programs aimed at helping them?'' Bush asked. ``Because
liberalism didn't help _ it often made the problem worse.''
   The vice president took some time out from his campaign duties
to telephone running mate Dan Quayle and wish him well in his
debate Wednesday night with Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, according to
Bush's chief of staff Craig Fuller.
   During the 10-minute conversation, Bush told Quayle, ``Relax, I
know it will go well.''
   Bush has been favorably impressed with Quayle, Fuller said.
``When the American people get a chance to see the Dan Quayle we
know they will all be favorably impressed,'' Fuller said.
   The vice president watched the debate from Fort Worth, Texas.
   ``He's doing good, good opening, right out of the ball park, the
Canseco of American politics,'' Bush said, referring to Oakland A's
baseball player Jose Canseco in describing Quayle's response to the
first question of the debate to a group of reporters he had invited
to watch the opening of the event. ``He hit it the first answer,
home run.''
   Bush also traveled Wednesday to Oklahoma City, where the oil
industry is struggling through tough times.
   ``You're back,'' Bush told a rally. ``Oklahoma is coming
strong.''
   Promising to decontrol natural gas, Bush said Dukakis is an
opponent of the energy industry but ``is now trying to fool the
American people by acting like he cares about the energy industry.''
   At the high school in the Denver suburb of Littleton, Bush said,
``Our future will be as strong tomorrow as our children are today.
And our children will be as strong as their education allows. Their
eduction will be as strong as their schools. But something more is
required: a family that functions and an environment that
motivates.''
   Included in the plan is a call to phase in affordable Medicaid
coverage for pregnant women and infants with incomes up to 185
percent of the poverty level. Bush also would expand on current
Medicaid coverage for children of families with incomes below the
poverty level by providing health-care education for those families.
   The proposals were an elaboration on Bush's remarks in his first
debate with Democratic rival Michael Dukakis that he wanted to
allow the poor to ``buy into'' Medicaid, said Steelman.
   Bush said he would also expand the Maternal and Child Health
Block Grant program to provide health and Medicaid information for
pregnant women and provide case management ``as an essential
component for high risk in teen-age pregnancies that are likely to
result in low birth weight.''
   He also called for mandatory Medicaid coverage ``of functionally
disabled children who would have to be in a hospital or other
institution without such coverage for home care.''
   In other areas, he called for:
   _ Mandatory child support levels and enforcement, and a
``nationwide parent locator system'' to track down delinquent
parents.
   _ Case management and counseling to teach parents about health
care and nutrition.
   _ Encouraging states to make drug testing a condition of bail,
probation and parole.
   _ A focus on crime in the schools with creation of a Justice
Department anti-gang unit to work with local jurisdictions.
   _ Legislation to give the federal government concurrent
jurisdiction over juveniles committing federal crimes, so that the
federal government can act ``if the state fails to vigorously
prosecute juveniles.''
   _ Housing vouchers to get assistance to low-income families, a
system he said would provide three times as much assistance as
building housing for the same price.
   In giving spending projections for the newly announced programs,
Steelman said the anti-gang unit portion would run about $50
million, new Medicaid for mothers and infants at 185 percent of the
poverty level would be $300 million with another $80 million for
case management in Medicaid.
   The radon and lead programs would cost $30 million, and a
program to help turn over subsudized housing to tenants would cost
$80 million, she said.

<HEAD>Eastern Airlines Plane Impounded After Cocaine Found Aboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered an Eastern Airlines
jetliner impounded Wednesday when nearly 20 pounds of cocaine were
found aboard, but an airlines spokeswoman said the plane was later
allowed to take off.
   The Lockheed L-1011 was preparing to leave Bogota for Miami and
New York Wednesday morning when police found the cocaine during a
routine search, Colombia's Civilian Aeronautics Administration said.
   A judge ordered the plane impounded until the National Drug
Board, a part of the Ministry of Justice, can decide whether the
plane should be seized or the airline fined.
   In Miami, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the plane was
allowed to leave after a hearing Wednesday and Flight 505 left four
hours behind schedule.
   ``The plane was confiscated but it was returned to us,'' Ms.
Ceremsak said. She said she did not know if Eastern had posted a
bond.
   Ms. Ceremsak said ground workers found the cocaine in a closet
but that company officials could not immediately determine when the
drug was placed in the plane.
   ``It was found by a cleaning crew in the rear of the aircraft
near the lavatories, in the cabin,'' she said.
   The plane arrived in Bogota Tuesday and had spent night at the
airport after arriving from Miami on Tuesday, the spokeswoman said.
   The impoundment appeared to be in reaction to U.S. Customs
officials having impounded jets belonging to Avianca Airlines of
Colombia several times in the last three years after cocaine was
found aboard them in Miami.
   Four months ago Avianca said it would no longer haul cargo from
Bogota to Miami because of the millions of dollars in fines it has
had to pay in the United States as a result of cocaine being found
in its cargo, especially in flower shipments.
   A few hours before the cocaine was found aboard the Eastern
plane Wednesday, police searching cargo on the tarmac of Bogota's
El Dorado international airport found 83.6 pounds of cocaine in
boxes of carnations bound for Boston. They were to be loaded aboard
a plane flown by Aerosel, a Colombian cargo airline.

   Moderator: John Margolis, a question for Senator Bentsen.
   Q: Sen. Bentsen, you have claimed that Vice President Bush and
the Republicans will raid the Social Security trust fund, and you
have vowed to protect it, but as chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, you must know that there is something to the argument of
your fellow Democrat, Bob Strauss, that some restraint on Social
Security growth may be needed, or at least some decision to tax
most Social Security benefits as regular income. In fact, you once
voted for, and spoke for, a six-month delay on cost-of-living
adjustment increases for Social Security. Senator, aren't you and
Gov. Dukakis using this issue politically, rather than dealing with
it responsibily?
   Bentsen: Well, I must say I hate to disappoint my good friend,
Bob Strauss, but we have a contract with the American people on
Social Security, and Social Security is an issue where Sen. Quayle
voted eight times to cut the benefits on Social Security.
   Quayle (interjecting) That's wrong.
   Bentsen (continuing) When this administration came in and tried
to cut the benefits, the minimum benefits _ $122 a month for
widows, for retirees _ tried to cut the benefits for 62-year-old
retirees by 40 percent, tried to do an end-run on Social Security
when they first came in after promising not to cut it, to cut it by
some 20 billion. And while we were working together to reform the
Social Security system and to be certain that that money was going
to be there for people when they retired, at that point they tried
a $40 billion end-run to cut Social Security. Now, the record is
clear.
   And we saw Vice President Bush fly back from the West Coast to
break a tie in the United States Senate. He doesn't get to vote
very often in the Senate but he made a special trip to come back
and vote against a cost of living increase. Now, when you talk
about Social Security the people that are going to protect it are
the Democrats who brought forth that program. And I think it's very
important that we now see these kinds of end-runs by this
administration. When they talk about the fact that they're going to
continue to cut this budget, I know too well what their track
record is. And we should be concerned about that kind of an effort
once again after the election is over.
   Moderator: Sen. Quayle, your response.
   Quayle: Sen. Bentsen, you know that I did not vote to cut Social
Security benefits eight times. What I have voted for, and what Sen.
Bentsen has voted for, is to delay the cost-of-living adjustments.
Sen. Bentsen, two times in the United States Senate, voted to delay
the cost-of-living adjustment. The governor of Massachusetts at a
governors' conference supported a resolution to delay the
cost-of-living adjustment.
   And, Jon, you're right, they use this for political advantage.
What they try to do time and time again is to scare the old people
of this country. That's the politics of the past. In 1983,
Republicans and Democrats dropped their political swords and, in a
bipartisan effort, saved the Social Security system. Republicans
and Democrats banded together because we know that this program is
not a Republican program, it's not a Democrat program; it's a
program for older Americans. And that program is actuarially sound
to the turn of this century.

   Moderator: Jon, a question for Senator Quayle.
   Q: Senator, since coming to the Senate, you have voted against
environmental protection legislation about two-thirds of the time.
These include votes against pesticide controls, the toxic waste
superfund, and health and safety protection from nuclear wastes.
Senator, do you consider yourself an environmentalist? And, if you
do, how do you reconcile that with your voting record?
   Quayle: I have a very strong record on the environment in the
United States Senate. I have a record where I voted for the
Superfund legislation. I have a record where I voted against my
president on the override of the Clean Water Act. I have voted for
the major pieces of environmental legislation that have come down
and been voted on in the United States Senate. This administration,
and I support this administration in its environmental effort, has
moved in the area for the first time to deal with the ozone
problem. We now have an international treaty, a treaty that is
commonly referred to as the Montreal Treaty. For the first time we
are talking about the impact of CO2 to the ozone layer. That's
progress for the environment. We are committed to the environment.
I take my children hiking and fishing, walking in the woods, in the
wilderness. Believe me, we have a commitment to preserving the
environment.
   If you bring up the environment, you can't help but think about
the environmental policy of the governor of Massachsetts. He talks
about being an environmentalist. Let me tell you about his
environmental policy. The Boston Harbor, the Boston Harbor which is
the dirtiest waterway in America. Tons of raw sewage go in there
each and every day. What has the governor of Massachusetts done
about that? Virtually nothing. Then he has the audacity to go down
to New Jersey and tell the people in New Jersey that he's against
ocean dumping. This is the same governor that applied for a license
to dump Massachusetts sewage, waste off the coast of New Jersey.
Who has the environmental record? Who has the environment
interests? George Bush and I do.
   Moderator: Senator Bentsen?
   Bentsen: Well this late conversion is interesting to me. When
they talk about Boston Harbor, and he says he hasn't done anything,
the facts are he has a $6 billion program underway on waste
treatment, and it was this administration, their administration,
that cut out the money early on to be able to clean up water and
made it impossible to move ahead at that time on Boston Harbor.
   We're the authors, the Democratic party, of Clean Air, of Clean
Water, of the Superfunding. I'm one who played a very major role in
passing the Superfund legislation. And every environmental
organization that I know, every major one has now endorsed the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. And I'm one who has just received the
environmental award in Texas for the work I've done to clean up the
bays, to clean up the water off the coast of Texas. Now I think we
know well who's going to help clean up this environment. The record
is there, the history is there and Dukakis and Bentsen will be
committed to that.

   Moderator: Tom Brokaw, a question for Senator Quayle.
   Q: Thank you Judy. Senator Quayle, there's been a lot of talk
during this course of this campaign about family, it was the
principle theme as I recall it in your acceptance speech in New
Orleans. Tonight I'd like to ask you about the 65 million American
children who live with their families in poverty. I'd like for you
to describe to the audience the last time that you may have visited
with one of those families personally, and how you explain to that
family your votes against the school breakfast program, the school
lunch program and the expansion of the child immunization program.
   Quayle: I have met with those people, and I met with them in
Fort Wayne, Indiana at a food bank. And you may be surprised Tom,
they didn't ask me those questions on those votes because they were
glad that I took time out of my schedule to go down and to alk
about how we're going to get a food bank going and making sure that
a food bank goes to Fort Wayne, Indiana. And I have a very good
record and a commitment to the poor, to those that don't have a
family, want to have a family. This administration and a George
Bush administration will be committed to eradicating poverty.
Poverty hasn't gone up in this administration. It hasn't gone down
much either, and that means that we have a challenge ahead of us.
But let me tell you something, what we have done for the poor. What
we have done for the poor is that we, in fact -- the homeless bill
-- the McKinney Act, which is a major piece of legislation that
deals with the homeless. Congress has cut the funding that the
administration recommended.
   The poor and poverty -- the biggest thing that we have done for
poverty in America is the Tax Simplification Act of 1986. Six
million working poor families got off the payroll. Six million
people are off the taxpaying payrolls because of that tax reform,
and they're keeping the tax money there. To help the poor, we'll
have a commitment to the programs, and those programs will go on.
And we are spending more in poverty programs today than we were in
1981. That is a fact. The poverty program we are going to
concentrate on is creating jobs and opportunities so that everyone
will have the opportunities that they want.
   Q: Senator Bentsen, your response.
   Bentsen: I find that very interesting, because he has been of no
help at all when it comes to passing the most major welfare reform
bill in the history of our country, one where we're working very
hard to see that people can get off welfare, break that cycle, take
a step up in life, doing the kinds of things that we did there to
let them have Medicaid for a year. That's a positive thing that's
done. What also frustrates me with the kind of report that I just
heard here is the kind of votes he's cast against child nutrition
programs, the fact that he has voted against money that we needed
for further immunization, the denial of polio shots to kids where
the parents couldn't afford to get that kind of a shot. Now I don't
really believe that is identifying with the concerns of people in
poverty.

   Moderator: Tom (Brokaw), a question for Sen. Bentsen.
   Q: Sen. Bentsen, I'd like to take you back to the question that
Judy (Woodruff) asked you about your differences with Michael
Dukakis on Contra aid. After all, Contra aid is one of the cutting
issues of foreign policy of this country in the last eight years.
You and Michael Dukakis seem to be diametrically opposed on that.
   I have been told that in a closed session of the U.S. Senate,
you made one of the most eloquent and statesmanlike speeches in
behalf of Contra aid that anyone had made in the eight years of the
Reagan term; that, in fact, you alluded to the threat the
Sandinista regime could pose to your own state of Texas. Gov.
Dukakis, on the other hand, has described the Contra aid policy as
``immoral and illegal.'' Is he wrong?
   Bentsen: Gov. Dukakis and I have disagreed on the Contra program
-- no question about that. But my big difference with this
administration is they look at the Contra aid program as the only
way to resolve that problem. The concentrate on that. And I really
think we have to give peace a chance. And that's why I've been a
strong supporter of the Arias plan, a plan that won the Nobel prize
for President Arias, the president of Costa Rica. I believe that
you have to work with the leaders of those other Central American
countries to try to bring about the democratization of Nicaragua by
negotiation, by pressure, by counseling, by diplomatic pressure _
that we ought to be trying that first.
   But in concentrating so much just on the Contras, this
administration has not paid enough attention to the rest of Central
America. The concern I have is that we have a country with 85
million people sharing a 2,000-mile border with us with half of
those people under the age of 15, a country that has had its
standard of living cut 50 percent in the last six years. Now, we
ought to be concerned about that and we ought to be involved. I was
born and reared on that Mexican border. I speak their language. I
spent a good part of my life down there. Gov. Dukakis speaks
Spanish, too. He's spent a good deal of time in Central and South
America.
   And we believe that we ought to be working together with a new
alliance for progress, bringing in other countries to help. Bring
in Europeans, the Spanish who have a real affinity for that area.
Bringing in the Japanese, who have a great capital surplus now and
looking for places to invest it. Those are the policy things I
think we could do to bring about peace in that area, to help raise
that standard of living and give them the kind of stability where
democracy can proceed and can prosper and bloom.
   Those are the kinds of things that we'd be committed to in a
Dukakis_Bentsen administration, to try to make this world a better
place in which to live.
   Moderator: Sen. Quayle, your response.
   Quayle: There's no doubt, in a Dukakis administration that the
aid would be cut off to the democratic resistance in Nicaragua and
that is unfortunate. The reason it is unfortunate _ because it is
beyond me why it's okay for the Soviet Union to put in billions of
dollars to prop up the communist Sandinistas, but somehow it's
wrong for the United States to give a few dollars to the democratic
resistance.
   There's a thing called the Monroe Doctrine, something that the
governor of Massachusetts has said has been superseded. I doubt if
many Americans agree with that. I think they believe in the Monroe
Doctrine. Sen. Bentsen talked about the entire Central America.
There's another issue that Michael Dukakis is wrong on in Central
America and that's Grenada. He criticized our rescue mission in
Grenada, according to a UPI report _ criticized that, yet 85
percent of the American people supported our rescue mission and we
turned a communist country into a non-communist country. The
Governor of Massachusetts is simply out of step with mainstream
American.

   Moderator: Brit Hume, a question for Senator Bentsen.
   Q: Good evening, Senator Bentsen, Senator Quayle. I'm sort of
the clean-up man in this order, and I've been asked by my
colleagues to try to deal with anything that's been left on base.
Senator, I have a follow-up question for you, Senator Quayle. But
Senator Bentsen, I first want to ask you a question about PAC
money, something I'm sure you're prepared to talk about. Governor
Dukakis has tried to make ethics a major issue in the campaign. And
he has you as a running mate, a man who leads the league, at last
count, in the receipt of PAC money _ that being the money raised by
the special interest organizations. That is the kind of campaign
financing which Governor Dukakis finds so distasteful that he has
refused to accept any of it. Do you find that embarrassing, Senator?
   Bentsen: No, I don't find it embarrassing at all because you
have to remember that PAC money is the result of the last campaign
reform bill, one that talks about employees have greater
participation. And what I've done in PAC money is just what my
opponent in my campaign has done in his campaign. He has, he's been
raising PAC money, too. So what you have to do is comply with the
laws as they are, whether you're paying taxes, or you're playing a
football game; whether you like those laws or not you comply with
them.
   Now, I have been for campaign reform and have pushed it very
hard. I believe that we have to do some things in that regard. But
I've noticed that the Senator from Indiana has opposed that
campaign reform and voted repeatedly against it. The things we have
to do, I believe, that will cut back on ``soft money,'' for
example, which I look on as frankly, one of those things that we
have had to do because the Republicans have done it for so long,
but I think it's a loophole, frankly.
   But campaign reform, changing the rules of the game, is
something we tried repeatedly in this session of the Congress, but
only to have the Republicans lead the charge against us and defeat
us. And I wish that Senator Quayle would change his mind on that
particular piece of legislation and give us the kind of a campaign
reform law that I think is needed in America.
   Moderator: Senator Quayle, your response.
   Quayle: Senator Bentsen is the number one PAC raiser. As a
matter of fact, he used to have a $10,000 Breakfast Club. A $10,000
Breakfast Club. It only cost high-paid lobbyist special interests
in Washington to come down and have breakfast with the chairman of
the Senate Finance Committe _ the one that oversees all the tax
loopholes in the tax code _ $10,000. I'm sure they weren't paying
to have Corn Flakes.
   Well I'll tell you the kind of campaign reform I'm supporting,
Senator Bentsen, I think it's time that we get rid of PAC money.
Support our legislation where we totally eliminate contributions by
special interests and political action committees, and let's have
the individual contribute and the political parties contribute.
That's the kind of campaign reform that Republicans are for. They
want to get rid of this special interest money and rely on the
individuals, and also the political parties.

   Moderator: Brit, your question for Senator Quayle. Once again,
let me caution the audience: please, keep your reaction as quiet as
possible. Brit.
   Q: Senator, I want to take you back, if I can, to the question
Judy asked you about some of the apprehensions people may feel
about your being a heartbeat away from the presidency. And let us
assume, if we can, for the sake of this question, that you become
vice president and the president is incapacitated for one reason or
another and you have to take the reins of power. When that moment
came, what would be the first steps that you'd take and why?
   Quayle: First I'd say a prayer for myself and for the country
that I'm about to lead. And then I would assemble his people and
talk. And I think this question keeps going back to qualifications
and what kind of vice president and this hypothetical situation if
I had to assume the responsibilities of the president what I would
be. And, as I have said, age alone -- although I can tell you,
after the experience of these last few weeks on the campaign, I've
added 10 years to my age -- age alone is not the only
qualification. You've got to look at experience, and you've got to
look at accomplishments. And can you make a difference?
   Have I made a difference in the United States Senate where I
served for eight years? Yes I have. Have I made a difference in the
Congress that I served for twelve years? Yes I have. As I said
before, looking at the issue of qualifications, and I am delighted
that it comes up, because on the three most important challenges
facing America -- arms control and national security, jobs and
education, and budget deficit -- I have more experience and
accomplishments than does the governor of Massachusetts.
   I have been in the Congress and I have worked on these issues.
And, believe me, when you look at arms control and trying to deal
with the Soviet Union, you cannot come at it from a naive position.
Youy have to understand the Soviet Union. You have to understand
how they will respond. Sitting on that Senate Armed Services
Committee for eight years has given me the experience to deal with
the Soviet Union and how we can move forward. That is just one of
the troubling issues that's going to be facing this nation. And I
am prepared.
   Q: Senator Bentsen?
   Bentsen: Well, I can't leave something on the table that he's
charged me with, so let's get to that one. When you talk about the
``Breakfast Club,'' as you know that was perfectly legal. And I
formed it and I closed it down almost immediately, because I
thought the perception was bad. But it's the same law. It's the
same law that lets you invite high-priced lobbyists down to
Williamsburg; and bring them down there and entertain them playing
golf, playing tennis and bringing Republican senators down there,
to have exchanged for that contributions to their campaign.
   It's the same kind of law that let's you have honorariums, and
you've collected over a quarter of a million dollars of honorariums
now, speaking to various interest groups. And there's no control
over what you do with that money. You can spend it on anything you
want to. You can spend it on golf club dues, if you want to do
that. Now that's what I've seen you do in this administration, and
that's why we need campaign reform laws and why I support them and
you, in turn, have voted against them time and time again.

   Striking Hollywood drivers and three
production companies agreed to an order Wednesday barring the
drivers from intimidating studio employees and disrupting film and
television production.
   To stem the increasingly violent atmosphere surrounding the
Teamsters strike, the Cannell Studios, Lorimar Studios and MTM-CBS
Studios joined in a temporary restraining order with the Teamsters
which was approved by Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin.
   The Teamsters agreed to observe new rules about the size of
picket contingents, how close they can come to studio gates and the
distance between the marchers and the pace at which they walk so as
to not obstruct traffic.
   The restrictions will be considered more fully at hearing Oct.
18. The walkout, affecting 3,200 drivers, laborers and
electricians, began Monday.
   The Cannell Studios closed down production on its shows
``Hunter'' and ``Sonny Spoon'' on Tuesday after a series of reports
of violence, including death threats, physical assaults and slashed
tires.
   Even as the Teamsters and the producers met in court, there were
more reports of confrontations. Location filming on the CBS series
``Murder, She Wrote'' was disrupted Wednesday when pickets
encouraged passing motorists to honk their horns, according to
security guard Charles Loust.
   Loust said that several replacement drivers went home early
because they were being harassed by pickets. Teamster officials did
not respond to interview requests.
   The Teamster drivers transport actors, equipment and props for
television and film producers. Joining the Teamsters on the picket
lines are 1,000 members of two other Basic Crafts unions, the
electricians and the laborers. The Hollywood plasterers and the
plumbers, the remaining Basic Crafts guilds, are not on strike.
   Issues in the strike include overtime rules for weekend work,
salary rates, wages for out-of-town film and television production,
seniority and guidelines for the making of nonunion films. Some
drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from $16.61 to $14 per
hour.
   The producers maintain that the Teamsters must help manage
mounting production costs and increased competition. Overall, the
contract proposal represents an increase in employment and
salaries, the producers say.

   Four members of Congress have called on the
South Korean government to curb violent demonstrations in Seoul
that they charged were instigated ``by militant Korean film
distributors who seek to retain their monopoly on U.S. film
distribution.''
   The demonstrations occurred outside a Seoul cinema where ``Fatal
Attraction,'' a U.S. motion picture hit, was booked through direct
royalty contract with the American exporter, cutting out the South
Korean middlemen, they said in a letter to South Korean Ambassador
Park Tong-jin.

Downey, D-N.Y., Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., and Frank J. Guarini,
D-N.J., all members of the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee
_ was released Wednesday by the Motion Picture Association of
America, which represents major Hollywood studios.
   ``Menacing crowds'' have blocked access and threatened the lives
of cinema owners and employees of U.S. distribution companies,
broken into cinemas, defaced the screens, spray-painted the seats
and let loose dangerous snakes, the letter said, quoting ``on-site
reports'' from Seoul.
   A Sept. 24 Associated Press dispatch from Seoul said
demonstrations halted operations at two theaters, there were no
clashes or arrests and participants included numerous Korean movie
celebrities protesting U.S. ``economic and cultural invasion.''
   ``These demonstrations are progressing unchecked by your
government,'' the letter said.
   There was no immediate comment from the South Korean Embassy.
   The dispute stems from a 1985 South Korean government agreement
with MPAA's export arm authorizing direct distribution of major
Hollywood productions, with the exporters splitting profits with
the theaters.
   The Motion Picture Export Association of America last month
filed a formal unfair trade complaint with the U.S. government
charging that South Korea and its film industry were violating the
pact with obstructive tactics such as involved censorship
procedures and other bottlenecks making it economically impossible
for U.S. distributors to open their own offices in the country.

<HEAD>`Killing Fields' Survivor Assails U.N. For Seating Khmer Rouge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Times photographer Dith Pran, a
survivor of Cambodia's killing fields, denounced the United Nations
on Wednesday for letting the Khmer Rouge be part of the Cambodian
U.N. delegation.
   ``I am still shocked when I see the Khmer Rouge flag on U.N.
territory. How would you feel if you were Jewish and you saw
Hitler's flag flying at the U.N.?'' Dith Pran asked a crowd of
about 250 demonstrators at a vigil outside U.N. Headquarters.
   The Khmer Rouge toppled the U.S.-backed Cambodian government in
1975, trapping Dith Pran in his country. Like most of the
population, he endured famine and forced labor on a collective
farm, but escaped to Thailand in 1979 and from there joined his
family in the United States.
   Dith Pran's ordeal, and that of his people, were the focus of
the film ``The Killing Fields.''
   Cambodia's U.N. delegation called Wednesday for Vietnam's
withdrawal from their country, and said a political solution to the
nation's troubles must be based on national reconciliation among
all parties, including the Khmer Rouge, which ruled until 1979.
   But Son Sann, prime minister of the government-in-exile fighting
the Hanoi-installed government in Phnom Penh, said an international
conference should adopt measures to prevent Vietnam's return or the
``illegal and violent seizure of power by one of the parties,'' a
reference to the Khmer Rouge.
   An estimated 2 million of Cambodia's 8 million people died from
Khmer Rouge executions, famine and civil unrest before Vietnam
invaded the country in late 1978 and ousted Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge
regime.
   Wednesday's vigil to protest the Khmer Rouge presence, organized
by the Oxfam America famine relief agency, coincided with
Cambodia's speech to the 43rd General Assembly.
   Oxfam's executive director John Hammock and several of its
officers began a three-day fast Wednesday to protest Khmer Rouge
membership in the United Nations.
   Dith Pran did not join them.
   ``I starved almost four years already; I did enough myself,'' he
said.
   Oxfam, Dith Pran, and many Cambodians fear that the
Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, the best armed of the three groups
fighting the current government in Phnom Penh, will seize power.
   Hanoi has said it will withdraw 50,000 of its 120,000 occupation
troops from Cambodia this year, and all will be out by early 1990.
   Among those pessimistic about the future of Cambodia is Dith
Pran's friend, Sydney Schanberg, the Pulitzer Prize-winning former
correspondent for The New York Times.
   Schanberg lingered almost unnoticed at Wednesday's vigil and
declined to be interviewed, saying this was an occasion for the
Cambodians to be heard. But he said he could not believe China
would desert its longtime ally, the Khmer Rouge.
   In the U.N. General Assembly, Son Sann assailed Vietnam's
occupation forces.
   Son Sann's non-communist Khmer People's National Liberation
Front, and forces loyal to former Cambodian head of state Prince
Norodom Sihanouk make up the U.N.-recognized delegation along with
the Khmer Rouge.
   Under the U.N. Charter and international law, the United Nations
says it cannot recognize a government imposed on a country by
outside force, such as the present Cambodian government installed
by Hanoi.

<HEAD>Bells Peal Across Brasilia As Brazil Enacts Eighth Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Church bells rang in this modernistic
capital Wednesday as Brazil enacted its eighth constitution,
consolidating the switchover from military rule to civilian
government that began in 1985.
   The 559 legislators, who for 19 months battled over the
245-article document, cheered and shouted ``Brazil is changing!''
as the president of the Constituent Assembly, Ulysses Guimaraes,
declared law the new document.
   ``I declare enacted the constitution of liberty, of dignity, of
democracy and social justice,'' Guimaraes, 72, said in a voice that
struggled above thunderous applause. ``May God help us enforce it.''
   Brazil's new democratic charter leaves behind the old
authoritarian document that was handed down by military generals in
1969.
   The enactment was the last step in Brazil's return to fully
democratic rule begun in March 1985, when Jose Sarney became
Brazil's first civilian president since a 1964 right-wing military
coup.
   ``We have created a new Brazil, a new social and economic
order,'' Dante de Oliveira of the governing Democratic Movement
Party said after the ceremony. ``We have taught the world an
important lesson, peacefully overturning an authoritarian regime.''
   The new document, a mixture of left-leaning, conservative and
nationalistic articles that touch almost all aspects of life from
land reform to interest rates, granted none of the arbitrary powers
used by the repressive military government during 21 years to rule
the country.
   The new charter bans censorship, removes the president's power
to simply decree law and outlaws torture, which in the past was
used against the military government's political opponents.
   But many of the articles were confusing. Several such as a
reduced work week, more maternity leave and extra pay for overtime
immediately became law; 154 would need complimentary legislation to
become effective.
   One such confusing article limited ``real'' interest rates to 12
percent though no one knows what ``real'' interest rates in
inflation-ridden Brazil are. Inflation in Brazil is averaging more
than 350 percent over the last 12 months.
   One of the most controversial articles fought over by
legislators, who shouted each other down in day-long debates and
often resorted to physical violence, set presidential elections in
November 1989. Brazilians haven't voted for president since 1960.
   Representatives from 21 Latin American and Portuguese-speaking
nations watched legislators enact Brazil's eighth constitution
since the country gained independence from Portugal in 1822.

   A 14-year-old boy fleeing police in a
stolen car apparently shot himself in the head early Wednesday
after he crashed into a ditch, police said.
   Timothy Dale Wilson of Ashland was found dead in the driver's
seat, and a .38-caliber revolver car reported stolen Tuesday from
an Ashland home was found in the car, police said.
   Police said Wilson was born in Vietnam and adopted as an infant,
but had been living with foster parents since early last summer
after stealing his father's car.
   The chase began at 12:50 a.m. when Ashland police spotted a car
that had been reported stolen Tuesday morning. Police from Ashland,
Talent and Phoenix were following Wilson when the car crashed on
Highway 99 in Phoenix.
   Police Chief Vic Lively said the car had been stolen sometime
Monday night in Ashland. The revolver and two knives, reported
stolen Tuesday from a house in Ashland, were found in the car with
Wilson, police said.
   Police said a young man with a gun tried to rob a waiter at a
Medford restaurant Tuesday night. The waiter later identified
Wilson as the gunman.
   News of Wilson's death stunned officials at Ashland High School,
where he was a freshman.
   ``He was bubbly, he was outgoing,'' said Randy Rogney, a school
counselor. ``He was fun to be around. The kids here are in shock.''
   Vice Principal Jeff Schlecht said he never had any trouble with
Wilson.
   ``He had a ready smile, you could kid him and he'd kid back,'
Schlecht said.
   Wilson's father said the boy's adoptive mother died when he was
six. ``I don't know what his basic mental problem was that
triggered him off,'' Bob Wilson said. ``He was a good son.''

<HEAD>OMAHA, Neb.: time again.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Moderator: Jon Margolis, question for Sen. Quayle.
   Q: Sen. Quayle, in recent years the Reagan administration has
scaled back the activities of the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, prompted in part by Vice President Bush's task
force on regulatory relief. The budget for the agency has been cut
by 20 percent, and the number of inspections at manufacturing
plants have been reduced by 33 percent.
   This has had a special effect in this area where many people
work in the meat-packing industry, which has a far higher rate of
serious injuries than almost any other injury, a rate which appears
to have been rising, although we're not really sure because some of
the largest companies have allegedly been falsifying their reports.
Would you acknowledge to the hundreds of injured and maimed people
in Nebraska, Iowa, and elsewhere in the Midwest that, in this case,
deregulation may have gone too far and the government should
reassert itself in protecting workers' rights?
   Quayle: The premise of your question, Jon, is that somehow this
administration has been lax in enforcement of the OSHA regulations,
and I disagree with that, and I'll tell you why. If you want to ask
some business people that I've talked to periodically, they
complain about the tough enforcement of this administration.
   And furthermore, let me tell you this for the record, when we
have found violations in this administration there has not only
been tough enforcement, but there have been the most severe
penalties _ the largest penalties in the history of the Department
of Labor _ have been levied when these violations have been found.
   There is a commitment, and there will always be a commitment, to
the safety of our working men and women. They deserve it, and we're
committed to them. Now, the broader question goes to the whole
issue of deregulation, and has deregulation worked or has
deregulation not worked? In my judgment, deregulation has worked.
We have a deregulated economy and we have produced through low
taxes, not high taxes, through deregulation, the spirit of
entrepreneurship, the individual going out and starting a business,
the businessman or woman willing to go out and risk their
investment and start up a business and hire people _ we have
produced 17 million jobs in this country since 1982.
   Deregulation as a form of political philosophy is a good
philosophy. It's one that our opponents disagree with. They want a
centralized government. But we believe in the market; we believe in
the people. And yes, there's a role of government and the role of
government is to make sure that those safety and health and welfare
of the people is taken care of. And we'll continue to do that.
   Moderator: Sen. Bentsen?
   Bentsen: I think you see once again a piece of Democratic
legislation that's been passed to try to protect the working men
and women of America. And then you've seen an administration that
came in and really didn't have its heart in that kind of an
enforcement. A good example of that is the environmental protection
laws that we were talking about a moment ago. This administration
came in and put in a James Watt and Anne Gorsuch. Now that's the
Bonnie and Clyde, really, of environmental protection. And that's
why it's important that you have people that truly believe, and
trying to represent the working men and women of America. Most
employers do a good job of that, but some of them put their profits
before people. And that's why you have to have OSHA, and that's why
you have to have tough and good and fair enforcement of it. And
that's what a Democratic administration would do to help make this
working place a safer and a better place to be employed.
   Moderator: Jon Margolis, another question for Senator Bentsen.
   Q: Sen. Bentsen, since you have been in the Senate, the
government has spent increasing amounts of money in an effort to
protect the family farmer. But most of the subsidies seem to go, do
go, to the largest and richest farmers, who presumably need it
least, while it's the smaller farmers who are often forced to sell
out, sometimes to their large farmer neighbor who's gotten more
subsidies to begin with.
   Despite the fact that I believe you, sir, are rather a large
farmer yourself, do you believe it's time to uncouple the subsidy
formula from the amount of land a farmer has and target federal
money to the small- and medium-size farmer?
   Bentsen: Well, I've supported that. I voted for the 50,000
limitation to get away from the million dollar contributions to
farmers. You know, of the four that are on this ticket, I'm the
only one that was born and reared on a farm, and still involved in
farming. So I think I understand their concerns and their problems.
Now, I feel very strongly that we ought to be doing more for the
American farmer, and what we've seen under this administration is
neglect of that farmer.
   We've seen them drive 220,000 farmers off the farm. They seem to
think the answer is, ``Move 'em to town.'' But we ought not to be
doing that. What you have seen them do is cut farm assistance for
the rural areas by over 50 percent. We're seeing rural hospitals
close all over the country because of this kind of an
administration. We've seen an administration that has lost much of
our market abroad because they have not had a trade policy. We saw
our market lost by some 40 percent. And that's one of the reasons
that we've seen the cost of the farm program, which was only about
$2.5 billion when they took office, now go to about $25 billion.
Now we can bring that kind of a cost down and get more to market
prices if we'll have a good trade policy.
   I was, in January, visiting with Mr. Takeshita, the new prime
minister of Japan. I said, ``You're paying five times as much for
beef as we pay for in our country -- pay for it in our country --
six times as much for rice. You have a $60 billion trade surplus
with us. You could improve the standard of living of your people.
You're spending 27 percent of your disposable income on food. We
spend 14 or 15 percent. When you have that kind of a barrier up
against us, that's not free and fair trade, and we don't believe
that should continue.
   We would be pushing very hard to open up those markets, and
stand up for the American farmer. And see that we recapture those
foreign markets, and I think we can do it with a Dukakis-Bentsen
administration.
   Moderator: Sen. Quayle.
   Quayle: Sen. Bentsen talks about recapturing the foreign
markets. Well, I'll tell you one way that we're not going to
recapture the foreign markets, and that is if, in fact, we have
another Jimmy Carter grain embargo. Jimmy --Jimmy Carter grain
embargo -- Jimmy Carter grain embargo set the American farmer back.
You know what the farmer is interested in? Net farm income. Every 1
percent of increase in interest rates -- a billion dollars out of
the farmer's pocket. Net farm income -- increase inflation another
billion dollars.
   Another thing that a farmer's not interested in and that's
supply management the Democratic platform talks about. But, the
governor of Massachusetts, he had the farm program. He went to the
farmers in the Midwest, and told them not to grow corn, not to grow
soy beans, but to grow Belgium endive. That's what his -- that's
what he and his Harvard buddies think of the American farmer. Grow
Belgium endive. To come in and to tell our farmers not to grow
corn, not to grow soy beans, that's the kind of farm policy you'll
get under a Dukakis administration, and one I think the American
farmer rightfully will reject.

   Moderator: Tom Brokaw, a question for Senator Bentsen?
   Q: Senator Bentsen, you were a business man before you entered
the U.S. Senate. Let me offer you an inventory, if I may: lower
interest rates, lower unemployment, lower inflation, and arms
control deal with the Soviet Union. Now, two guys come through your
door at your business, and say, ``We'd like you to change,''
without offering a lot of specifics.'' Why would you accept their
deal?
   Bentsen: You know, if you let me write $200 billion worth of hot
checks every year, I could give you an illusion of prosperity, too.
This is an administration that has more than doubled the national
debt, and they've done that in less than eight years. They have
taken this country from the number one lender nation in the world
to the number one debtor nation in the world. And the interest on
that debt next year, on this Reagan-Bush debt of our nation, is
going to be $640 dollars for every man, woman and child in America,
because of this kind of a credit card mentality. So, we go out and
we try to sell our securities, every week, and hope that the
foreigns will buy them. And they do buy them, but every time they
do, we lose some of our economic independence for the future.
   Now they've turned around and they've bought 10 percent of the
manufacturing base of this country. They bought 20 percent of the
banks. They own 46 percent of the commercial real estate in Los
Angeles. They're buying America on the cheap. Now when we have
other countries that can't manage their economy down in Central and
South America, we send down the American ambassador. We send down
the International Monetary Fund and we tell them what they can buy
and what they can sell and how to run their economies. The ultimate
irony would be to have that happen to us because foreigners finally
quit buying our securities.
   So what we need in this country is someone like Mike Dukakis who
gave 10 balanced budgets in a row there and was able to do that,
meet that kind of a commitment, set those tough priorities. We need
an administration that will turn this trade policy around and open
up those markets, stand tough with our trading partners to help
keep the jobs at home and send the products abroad.
   Moderator: Senator Quayle?
   Quayle: Senator Bentsen talks about running up the debt. Well
the governor of Massachusetts has run up more debt than all the
governors in the history of Massachusetts combined going back to
the days of the Pilgrims. I don't believe that that's the kind of
policy that we want. The question went to the heart of the matter,
Tom. You asked the question that why would we change? Well we have
changed since 1980. We've got interest rates down. We got inflation
down. People are working again. America is held in respect once
again around the world. But we're going to build on that change.
   And as we made those positive change of lower interest rates,
lower rate of inflation, the governor of Massachusetts fought us
every step of the way. We are proud of the record of accomplishment
and the opportunities and the hope for millions of Americans _ hope
and opportunity of these Americans is because of the policies that
we have had for the last eight years and we want to build on that
and change it for even the better.
   Moderator: Tom, a question for Senator Quayle.
   Q: Senator Quayle as you mention here tonight, you actively
supported the invasion of Grenada which was the military operation
to rescue some American medical students and to rescue an island
from a Marxist takeover. If military force was necessary in that
endeavor, why not use the military to go after the South American
drug cartels and after General Noriega for that matter on a
surgical strike, since drugs in the minds of most Americans pose a
far greater danger to many more people?
   Quayle: You're absolutely right. You're absolutely right the
drug problem is the number one issue.
   Q: But would you please address the military aspect of it?
   Quayle: I will address the military aspect if I may respond. The
military aspect of the drug problem is being addressed. As a matter
of fact, we are using the Department of Defense in a coordinated
effort on reconnaissance, but I don't believe that we're going to
turn the Department of Defense into a police organization. We are
using our military assets in a prudent way to deal with
interdiction. And we've made some success in this area. Seventy
tons of cocaine have been stopped.
   But, you know, when you look at the drug problem, and it is a
tremendous problem and there are no easy solutions to it, it's a
complicated problem. And it's heading up the effort to try to
create a drug-free America, which is a challenge and a goal of all
of us. Not only will we utilize national defense and the Department
of Defense, but we've got to get on the demand side of the ledger.
We've got to get to education, and education ought to begin at
home, and it ought to be reinforced, reinforced in our schools.
   And there's another thing that will be more important than the
premise of this question on a hypothetical of using troops. We'll
use military assets. We're not going to, we'll use military assets,
but we need to focus on another part of this problem, and that
problem is law enforcement. And here's where we have a major
disagreement with the governor of Massachusetts. He is opposed to
the death penalty for drug kingpins. We believe people convicted of
that crime deserve the death penalty, as does the legislation
that's in the Congress that's supported by a bipartisan group,
including many Democrats of his party. He also was opposed to
mandatory drug sentencing for drug dealers in the state of
Massachusetts. You cannot have a war on drugs, you cannot be tough
on drugs and weak on crime.
   Moderator: Senator Bentsen.
   Bentsen: It's interesting to see that the senator from Indiana,
when we had a resolution on the floor of the United States Senate
sponsored by Senator Dole, that this government would make no deal
with Noriega, that the senator from Indiana was one of the dozen
senators that voted against it. It's also interesting to see that
one of his campaign managers that's trying to help him with his
image, was also hired by Noriega to help him with his image in
Panama.
   What we have seen under this administration, we have seen them
using eight Cabinet officers, 28 different agencies, all fighting
over turf. And that's one thing we'd correct under the
Dukakis-Bentsen administration. We'd put one person in charge in
the war against drugs, and we'd commit the resources to get that
job done. Now, Mike Dukakis has been able to do that type of thing
in the state of Massachusetts by cutting the drug use in high
schools while it's going up around the rest of the country, by
putting in a drug educational program that the Drug Enforcement
Agency said was a model for the country. We'd be doing that around
the rest of the country. That's a positive attack against drugs.

   Moderator: Brit Hume, a question for Senator Quayle.
   Q: Senator, I want to take you back to the question that I asked
you earlier about what would happen if you were to take over in an
emergency and what you would do first and why. You said you'd say a
prayer and you said something about a meeting. What would you do
next?
   Quayle: I don't believe that it's proper for me to get into the
specifics of a hypothetical situation like that. The situation is
that if I was called upon to serve as the president of this
country, or the responsibilities of the president of this country,
would I be capable and qualified to do that? And I've tried to list
the qualifications of 12 years in the United States Congress. I
have served in the Congress for 12 years; I have served in the
Congress and served eight years on the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   I have traveled a number of times; I've been to Geneva many
times to meet with our negotiators as we were hammering out the INF
Treaty. I've met with the Western political leaders -- Margaret
Thatcher, Chancellor Kohl -- I know them; they know me. I know what
it takes to lead this country forward. And if that situation
arises, yes, I will be prepared, and I'll be prepared to lead this
country if that happens.
   Q: Senator Bentsen.
   Bentsen: Well once again, I think what we're looking at here is
someone that can step in at the presidency level at the moment, if
that tragedy would occur. And if that's the case, again you have to
look at maturity of judgment, and you have to look at breadth of
experience. You have to see what kind of leadership roles that
person has played in his life before that crisis struck him. And if
you do that type of thing, then you'll arrive at a judgment that I
think would be wise one, and I hope that would mean that you say,
``We're going to vote for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen.''
   Moderator: Brit, a question for Senator Bentsen.
   Q:: Senator, I want to take you back, if I can, to the
celebrated ``breakfast club.'' When it was first revealed that you
had a plan to have people pay $10,000 a plate to have breakfast
with you, you handled it with disarming, not to say charming,
candor. You said it was a mistake and you disbanded it and called
the whole idea off, and you were widely praised for having handled
it deftly. The question I have is, if the Washington Post had not
broken that story and other media picked up on it, what can you
tell us tonight as to why we should not believe that you would
still be having those breakfasts to this day?
   Bentsen: (Laughs) Well, I must say, Brit, I don't make many
mistakes, but that one was a real doozie. And I agree with that.
And, as you know, I immediately disbanded it; it was perfectly
legal. And you have all kinds of such clubs on the Hill, and you
know that. And -- but I still believe that the better way to go is
to have a campaign reform law that takes care of that kind of a
situation. Even though it's legal, the perception is bad. So I
would push very strong to see that we reform the entire situation.
I'd work for that end and that's what my friend from Indiana has
opposed repeatedly, vote after vote.
   Moderator: Senator Quayle?
   Quayle: He disbanded the club, but he's still got the money. He
is the number one receiver of political action committee money.
Now, Senator Bentsen's talked about reform. Well, let me tell you
about the reform that we're pushing. Let's eliminate political
action committees to special interest money. There's legislation
before the Congress to do that. That way we won't have to worry
about breakfast clubs or who's the number one PAC raiser. We can go
back and get the contributions from the working men and women and
the individuals of America. We can also strengthen our two-party
system, and it needs strengthening, and rely more on the political
parties than we have in the past. That's the kind of campaign
reform that I'm for, and I hope the senator will join me.

<HEAD>Union, Electric Boat Officials Negotiate At Federal Mediation
Agency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Union negotiators and officials representing
the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corp. met with
federal mediators for eight hours Wednesday to try to settle a
3-month-old strike at the company's main shipyard in Groton, Conn.,
that has crippled the submarine maker.
   Negotiating teams for the Metal Trades Council and the company
met behind closed doors at the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service before breaking up at 9:15 p.m. without announcing a
resolution.
   The bargaining session was scheduled to resume Thursday morning.
   Officials refused to discuss or characterize Wednesday's talks,
saying representatives for both sides said they were asked by the
federal agency not to discuss the negotiations. .
   ``I can't make any comment on whether we're optimistic or
pessimistic. We're just going to meet tomorrow and see what
happens,'' said mediator Thomas Carroll.
   Wednesday's meeting was the first major bargaining session since
both sides broke off talks after meeting Aug. 11 and 12 with the
federal agency. Union officials requested the new round of talks.

<HEAD>Ex-Wife: Chambers Killed Bean During Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KEENE, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Marlow police chief Robert Chambers
killed his drinking buddy with a hatchet when the man tried to
protect Chambers' estranged wife, she said in an interview
published Wednesday.
   As he lay dying outside Chambers' home on Sept. 15, 1978,
Russell Bean, then 25, looked at Deborah Wentworth, told her to
take care of his children, and said he loved his wife, Sylvia,
Wentworth told The Keene Sentinel.
   Chambers declined to comment on the account, referring the
Sentinel's questions to his lawyer, Mark Sisti, who also declined
to comment.
   Since Bean's skeletal remains were unearthed in March in
Chambers' front yard, Chambers, 36, has said only six words
publicly about the case: ``I did not kill Russ Bean.'' He was
arrested April 15.
   Sisti tried to bar the state from presenting Wentworth's
testimony to a grand jury in May, questioning her competence and
citing a history of psychiatric treatment.
   Wentworth testified to the grand jury that prosecutors asked to
issue a murder indictment. The grand jury, whose proceedings are
secret, returned no indictment, leaving Chambers a free man.
   He is living with a policeman-friend in Hinsdale and working as
a logger, the job he held 10 years ago. Phones calls to the
residence went unanswered.
   Wentworth also could not be reached.
   Police, acting on tips from Chambers' relatives, began digging
in his front yard on March 11. They told police that Robert
Chambers' father, Clifton, told them Chambers came to him one night
10 years ago and said he had accidentally killed Bean in a fight,
and that father and son had buried the body with a backhoe. Clifton
Chambers died of a cerebral hemorrhage March 9.
   Bean's body was uncovered on March 14 and an autopsy indicated
he was struck with something, but authorities have never said what.
When Chambers' relatives told them Bean was killed with a hatchet
that was thrown into a quarry, police later drained the quarry, but
found nothing.
   Chambers has resigned as Marlow's part-time police chief, a job
he held three years.
   The Sentinel said it interviewed Wentworth, 36, as well as
investigators whom it did not identify and many of the people
interviewed by police in their investigation.
   Not long after Bean's death, his wife Sylvia and her three
children moved in with Chambers, whom Wentworth had left several
months earlier with Chambers' two sons. Sylvia Bean and Chambers
subsequently married, though she moved out and filed for divorce
after Bean's body was dug up.
   According to the paper, Sylvia _ then married to Bean _ said
Robert Chambers and her husband went out drinking and partying
constantly until she finally told Bean it had to stop. She said he
agreed, but that on Sept. 15, 1978, Bean left with Chambers around
6 p.m.
   According to Wentworth and sources familiar with her grand jury
testimony, Wentworth hitchhiked with suitcases to Chambers' rural
home that evening. Chambers and Bean arrived a few minutes later,
and when Chambers saw her, he got angry and called her vulgar names.
   Bean tried to come to her defense, she told the paper, but
Chambers pushed her toward Bean, saying he could have her, an
apparent reference to an affair Bean and Wentworth had had earlier.
   Wentworth told the paper that when Bean stepped between her and
Chambers, Chambers picked up a hatchet and hit Bean several times
in the head and once in the chest.
   She told the Sentinel that Chambers then forced her into his
truck, threw her suitcases in back, and drove her the short
distance to Newell Pond, where he beat her again, threatened her
and left. Again a motorist picked her up.
   ``If I can find whoever picked her up, I hope (Wentworth) told
them something,'' Sgt. Richard Rondo, chief state police
investigator in the case, told the Sentinel.
   Police investigated Bean's disappearance, but closed the case,
assuming Bean abandoned his family.

   Moderator: Jon Margolis, a question for Sen. Bentsen.
   Q: Senator, we've all just finished _ most America has just
finished one of the hottest summers it can remember, and apparently
this year will be the fifth out of the last nine that are among the
hottest on record. No one knows, but most scientists think that
something we're doing, human beings are doing, are (sic)
exacerbating this problem and that this could, in a couple of
generations, threaten our descendents' comfort and health and
perhaps even their existence.
   As vice president, what would you urge our government to do to
deal with this problem? And specifically, as a Texan, could you
support a substantial reduction in the use of fossile fuel, which
might be necessary down the road?
   Bentsen: Well, I think what you can do in that one, and which
would be very helpful, is to use a lot more natural gas, which
burns a lot cleaner. And what Mike Dukakis has said is that he'll
try to break down those regulatory roadblocks that you have in the
regulatory agency that denies much of the passage of that natural
gas to the Northeast, where you, in turn, can fight against acid
rain, which is another threat because it's sterilizing our lakes,
it's killing our fish.
   And it's interesting to me to see in the resume of Sen. Quayle
that he brags on the fact that he's been able to fight the acid
rain legislation. I don't think that that's a proper objective in
trying to clean up this environment. But the greenhouse effect is
one that has to be a threat to all of us, and we have to look for
alternative sources of fuel, and I've supported that very strongly.
   The Department of Energy is one that has cut back substantially
on the study of those alternative sources of fuel. We can use other
things that'll help the farmer. We can convert corn to ethanol, and
I would push for that very strong. So absolutely, I'll do those
things that are necessary to put the environment of our country
number one, because if we don't protect that, we'll destroy the
future of our children, and we must be committed to trying to clean
up the water, clean up the air, and do everything we can not only
from a research standpoint, but also in the applied legislation to
see that that's carried out.
   Moderator: Sen. Quayle?
   Quayle: Vice President George Bush has said that he will take on
the environmental problem. He has said further that he will deal
with the acid rain legislation and reduce millions of tons of the
SO-2 content. That legislation won't get through the Congress this
year, but it will get through in a George Bush administration, a
George Bush administration that is committed to the environment.
Now the greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue. It
is important for us to get the data in, to see what alternatives we
might have to the fossil fuels, to make sure that we know what
we're doing. And there are some explorations and things that we can
consider in this area. The drought highlighted the problem that we
have. And, therefore, we need to get on with it. And in a George
Bush administration, you can bet that we will.
   Moderator: A question for Sen. Quayle.
   Q: Senator, as vice president, your most important contribution
would be the advice you gave the president. One of the most
troubling facts that's going to face the new administration is the
fact that the United States has now become the world's largest
debtor nation. In 1987, foreigners underwrote our debts to the tune
of about $138 billion.
   Last week, a top official of the Japanese Economic Planning
Agency bragged that Japan now is in a position to influence the
value of the dollar, of our interest rates, and even our stock
prices, and he warned that one day maybe they'd do just that. If
you were vice president of the United States and Japan did that,
what would you tell the president to do?
   Quayle: When you look at dealing with this total problem -- not
just with the Japanese, but the underlying question on this total
world debt problem -- you have got to see why are we a debtor and
what is attracting the foreign investment into our country today,
whether it's the Japanese or others.
   I would rather have people come over here and to make
investments in this country rather than going elsewhere, because by
coming over here and making investments in this country, we are
seeing jobs. Do you realize that today we are producing Hondas and
exporting Hondas to Japan? We are the envy of the world.
   The United States -- some of Sen. Bentsen's supporters laugh at
that. They laugh at that, because they don't believe that the
United States of America is the envy of the world. Well, I can tell
you, the American people think the United States of America is the
envy of the world.
   Moderator: Sen. Bentsen -- oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
   Quayle: We are the greatest nation in this world and the
greatest economic power. Now, there's been some talk in Congress
about forgiveness of debt. Forgiveness of debt is wrong.
Forgiveness of international debt would be counterproductive. And
I'd like to see those that talk about forgiving debt, Senator
Bentsen, to go out and talk about the farmer that's in debt that
doesn't have his forgiven. That's not the kind of policy George
Bush will have.
   Moderator: Sen. Bentsen.
   Bentsen: Well, I've told you what I'd do about trade and trying
to help turn that situation around. But we also should do is get
them to give us more burden-sharing when it comes to national
defense. We have a situation today where on a per capita basis,
people in western Europe are spending about one third as much as we
are in our country. And then when you go to Japan, where we're
spending 6{ percent on defense of the democracies, they're spending
1 percent.
   I met with some of the Japanese business leaders, talking to
them about it. And I said, ``You know, we have 50,000 troops here
in Japan, protecting the democracies of Asia. And it costs $3.5
billion a year. You're the number two economic power in the world.
You ought to measure up to that responsibility and carry some of
that cost.''
   I said, ``If we were not doing what we're doing, we'd have a big
budget surplus.'' And I said, ``You'd have chaos, because you get
55 percent of your oil from the Persian Gulf and you wouldn't have
the U.S. Navy down there to take care of that.'' Now, the senator
from Indiana, when we passed a resolution in the United States
Senate to ask for burden-sharing on that cost to keep those sea
lanes open from the Japanese, he voted against that. I don't
understand that.

   Moderator: Tom Brokaw, a question for Senator Quayle.
   Q: Senator Quayle, I don't mean to beat this drum until it has
no more sound left in it, but to follow up on Brit Hume's question,
when you said that it was a hypothetical situation, it is sir,
after all the reason that we're here tonight, because you are
running not just for vice president. And if you cite the experience
that you had in Congress, surely you must have some plan in mind
about what you would do if it fell to you to become president of
the United States as it has to so many vice presidents just in the
last 25 years or so.
   Quayle: Let me try to answer the question one more time. I think
this is the fourth time that I have had this question and _
   Q: Third time.
   Quayle: Three times, that I've had this question and I'll try to
answer it again for you as clearly as I can because the question
you're asking is ``What kind of qualifications does Dan Quayle have
to be president?'' What kind of qualifications do I have and what
would I do in this kind of a situation? And what would I do in this
situation?
   I would make sure that the people in the Cabinet and the people
and advisors to the president are called. I'll talk to them and
I'll work with them. And I will know them on a first-hand basis,
because as vice president, I'll sit on the National Security
Council and I'll know them on a first-hand basis because I'm going
to be coordinating the drug effort. I'll know them on a first-hand
basis because Vice President George Bush is going to recreate the
Space Council and I'll be in charge of that. I will have day-to-day
activities with all the people in government.
   And then if that unfortunate situation happens, if that
situation which would be very tragic happens, I will be prepared to
carry out the responsibilities of the presidency of the United
States of America. And I will be prepared to do that. I will be
prepared not only because of my service in the Congress, but
because of my ability to communicate and to lead. It is not just
age, it's accomplishments, it's experience. I have far more
experience than many others that sought the office of vice
president of this country. I have as much experience in the
Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency. I will
be prepared to deal with the people in the Bush administration if
that unfortunate event would ever occur.
   Moderator: Senator Bentsen?
   Bentsen: Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack
Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack
Kennedy. What has to be done in a situation like that, (Applause)
in a situation like that is to call in the joint _
   Moderator: Please, please, once again you're only taking time
away from your own candidates.
   Quayle: That was really uncalled for Senator.
   Bentsen: You're the one that was making the comparison, Senator,
and I'm one who knew him well. And frankly, I think you're so far
apart in the objectives you choose for your country that I did not
think the comparison was well taken.
   Moderator: Tom, a question for Senator Bentsen.
   Q: Since you seem to be taking no hostages on the stage, let me
ask you a question about the American _ nine still in brutal
captivity in the Middle East. Senator Bentsen you have been
critical of the Iran-Contra affair. But tell me, does the
Dukakis-Bentsen ticket have any realistic plan for getting the
American hostages being held in the Middle East released in any due
time?
   Bentsen: Tom, that's one of the toughest problems that any chief
executive will face because you can't help but have the sympathy
for that family and for those hostages in themselves. But the one
thing we ought to have, know by now is that you can't go out and
make secret deals with the Ayatollah. You can't trade arms for
hostages. When you try to do that there's no question but what you
just encourage more taking of hostages. And that's been the result
by this dumb idea that was cooked out, cooked up in the White House
basement.
   And I want to tell you that George Bush, attending 17 of those
meetings and having no record of what he said _ if Lloyd Bentsen
was in those meetings, you would certainly hear from him, and no
one would be asking, ``Where is Lloyd?'' Because I would be making,
I would be saying, ``That's a dumb idea and now let's put an end to
it.'' And I would speak up on that type of thing. So all you can do
on that is to continue to push, use every bit of diplomatic
pressure you can, what you can do in the way of economic pressure
in addition to that. And that's what you strive to do to have a
successful release, finally, of those hostages. But not to
encourage more taking of hostages.
   Moderator: Senator Quayle?
   Quayle: There's no doubt about it that arms for hostages is
wrong, and it will never be repeated. We learn by our mistakes. But
there have been a number of successes in foreign policy in this
administration. But the question goes to a very difficult one: How
do you do it? No one has the answer. If they did we'd, we'd
certainly do it. But we won't keep trying, we'll keep trying, we'll
keep the doors open. And hopefully some day Iran, and others who
control those hostages, will want to return to civilized
international community. And they can do that starting now by
releasing those hostages that are held illegally.

<HEAD>Quayle Prepared for Most Asked Question _ On His Qualifications</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One question, asked time and time again,
towered over all others in Wednesday night's vice presidential
debate between Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen: could the Indiana
senator allay doubts about his qualifications for the office?
   The question showed Quayle at his most prepared, looking
straight into the camera, his gestures under control, citing his
12-year record in Congress.
   ``I have more experience and accomplishments than does the
governor of Massachusetts,'' he said, referring to Democratic
presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   As the debate progressed, the qualifications question came up
again and again and Quayle responded each time without an obvious
misstep. You could almost hear George Bush sigh with relief.
   Did you see anything that made you wince, Bush campaign chairman
James A. Baker III was asked immediately after the debate. ``I
didn't see anything that made we wince. When you think about what
might have happened, we have to be pretty happy,'' he said.
   If the winner of this debate were determined by advance
expectations, Quayle had a claim to victory.
   He walked on stage with both his supporters and opponents
wondering if he would stumble badly. He disappointed those who
hoped he would.
   But it was not clear whether Quayle eliminated the doubts. That
may not be known until Americans vote on Nov. 8.
   How he came across to the millions of TV viewers could be
critical in determining which ticket gets the support of the large
number of undecided voters.
   Poll after national poll indicated that voters had questions
about Quayle's qualifications. By contrast, few Americans
questioned Bentsen's ability to assume the presidency if called
upon.
   When Quayle compared his experience to that of John F. Kennedy,
it precipitated the sharpest clash of the 90-minute debate.
   ``Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine,'' said Bentsen, looking at
his 41-year-old opponent. ``Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.''
   ``That was uncalled for, senator,'' retorted Quayle.
   The format helped. All the questions were asked by a panel of
four journalists. The candidates had no opportunity to question
each other directly.
   But the panel kept the focus on the qualifications issue. Four
times Quayle was asked to cite his qualifications or say what he
would do if suddenly he became president.
   ``I don't mean to beat this drum until it has no more sound,''
said NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw as he raised the question once again.
   Obviously prepared for the question, the Indiana senator looked
straight into the camera and declared that ``age alone is not the
only qualification.''
   He cited his involvement in congressional debates on defense and
arms control, his authorship of job training legislation and his
service on the Senate Budget Committee.
   During his minute to respond to the same question, Bentsen
sought to up the stakes, to turn the question not to qualifications
for the No. 2 job.
   ``The debate tonight is about the presidency itself,'' he said.
   Bentsen took some heat himself on the question of his
differences with Dukakis on several major issues such as aid to the
contra rebels in Central America, gun control, abortion, and the
death penalty.
   The Texas senator was asked whose agenda he would follow if he
became president.
   He never responded to that question.
   Instead, Bentsen gave his stock answer, saying that ``we agree
on so many things, on the vast majority of the issues.''
   The Texan also had to respond to questions about his ``Breakfast
Club,'' a short-lived fund-raising device under which lobbyists
paid $10,000 for the privilege of having breakfast with the
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
   When the existance of the club was publicized, Bentsen dropped
it.

   Moderator: Brit Hume, a question for Senator Bentsen.
   Q: Senator, much of the Dukakis and Bentsen campaign of late has
been devoted to the notion that Senator Quayle isn't ready for the
vice presidency and perhaps the presidency. And certainly nothing
that you have said here tonight suggests that you think otherwise.
I wonder if you think it's really fair for you to advance that view
in light of the fact that you ran for the presidency, not the vice
presidency, in 1976, having not yet completed one full term in the
Senate and having previously served three terms in the House almost
a quarter of a century earlier, when in fact your time in
Washington was about equal to what he has now?
   Bentsen: Well, I think what you have to look at is the record of
a man who has served his country -- served his country in war,
headed up a squadron in combat, a man who built a business, knew
what it was to meet a payroll, create jobs, and then serve in the
United States Senate; and one who has been able to bring about some
of the kinds of legislation that I've been able to bring about in
my service there.
   I must say I didn't do a very good job of running for the
presidency, and I'm well aware of that. But what we're looking at
today is trying to judge, once again, the breadth of experience and
the maturity of someone taking on this kind of a task. That's the
judgment that has to be exercised by the people of America. It's a
presidential decision that you're facing, and it's a very important
one, because we're talking about who's going to lead this country
into its future, and you can't have a more important responsibility
than that one.
   Q: Senator Quayle?
   Quayle: When you look at qualifications, you look at
accomplishments as well as experience. And one of the
accomplishments that I'm proudest of is the authorship of the Job
Training Partnership Act that has trained and educated and employed
over 3 million young people and adults that are economically
disadvantaged.
   And we did it in a way that we got the private sector to involve
itself with the public sector on Private Industry Councils
throughout America that serve over the service delivery areas. We
have 51 percent of that Private Industry Council that are
businessmen and women; we have members of unions; we have
community-based organizations; we have education leaders. And what
we've been able to do is establish a program that's working, that's
putting people back to work. That is an accomplishment, and that is
an accomplishment that I will take with me into the White House.
   Moderator: Brit, a question for Senator Quayle.
   Q: Senator, I want to ask you a question, and it may be a little
off the subject of politics, it's aimed to get more at the question
of what sort of person you are. I hope that, Senator Bentsen, if
you choose to, you might choose to answer the same question in your
rebuttal time. Senator, can you identify any work of literature or
art, or even a film that you have seen or read or experienced
anywhere in the last two years that has had a particularly strong
effect on you, and tell us why?
   Quayle: In the last six months I think there are three very
important books that I read that have had an impact. The three
books are: one, Richard Nixon's ``Victory in 1999,'' Richard
Lugar's -- Senator Richard Lugar's ``Letters to the Next
President,'' Bob Massey's Alexandra -- ``Nicholas and Alexandra,''
which deals with the fall of the Russian empire and the coming of
Leninism in 1917.
   Those three books, which I read over the last spring vacation
and early summer, had a very definite impact because what former
President Nixon and Senator Richard Lugar were talking about was a
foreign policy as we move toward the 21st century. And the
historical book of the downfall of the Czar and the coming of
Leninism -- combining those three books together gave me a better
appreciation of the challenges that we have ahead of us. In Senator
Lugar's book he talks about the advancement of human rights around
the world. He talked about his leadership effort in the Philippines
and South Africa, where we now see human rights and advancement of
the Reagan agenda.
   Former President Nixon talked about what we're going to do after
detente and arms control, and how we're going to pursue new arms
control with the Soviet Union. He talked a little bit about how we
deal with the Soviet Union. And this is one of the differences
between George Bush and Michael Dukakis, because George Bush
understands to deal with the Soviet Union and to get progress, you
must deal from a position of strength. And the governor of
Massachusetts doesn't understand that. I understand it, and a
George Bush administration will pursue that policy.
   Q: Senator Bentsen?
   Bentsen: I think reading -- pardon me -- I think reading ``Winds
of War'' and ``Guns of August'' back to back, I think that really
shows you how we make the same mistakes too often, over and over
again. And it seems to me that the senator from Indiana is
beginning to do that one. As I look on the progress that's been
made toward disarmament and cutting back on nuclear weapons, and
see what Ronald Reagan has been able to do with the INF Treaty --
and I think he deserves great credit for that one -- I see a
situation where the senator from Indiana has now jumped off the
reservation when we talk about building on what Ronald Reagan has
done, and opposes what Ronald Reagan wants to do, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff and the secretary of defense, and says, ``Let's go slow on
doing further disarmament and trying to get to the next treaty.'' I
think that's a mistake.
   I think that you have to deal with the Russians from strength,
and we have to understand that you have to have a strong modernized
nuclear deterrent. But I think we can make substantial progress,
and we ought to take advantage of it. I think he's arrived at a
very dangerous judgment in the question of war and peace, and it
concerns me very much, because I saw him also try to sabotage the
INF Treaty when it was on the floor of the United States Senate,
with what he was doing there. He's listening once again --
   Moderator: Senator --
   Bentsen: to the winds of the radical right. My light was still
on, Judy.

<HEAD>Organizers Reject Criticism of Debate Staging as `Nonsense'</HEAD>

   Organizers scorned criticism of the staging
of Wednesday night's debate between Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen as
``a lot of nonsense'' which ignores the reality that the event is
essentially a television show.
   Ed Fouhy, executive producer of the 90-minute confrontation
between the two vice presidential candidates, says it's his
business to fret about such seemingly trivial details as camera
angles and the height of lecterns on the stage of the Omaha Civic
Auditorium.
   ``This is a television program, and we've got some of the best
production people in the world doing it,'' Fouhy said.
   Sharing Fouhy's concerns are the Democratic and Republican
contenders' campaign managers, who were eager to exploit the TV
format to best advantage. In the past week of mock debates and
briefings for the candidates, the medium was truly the message.
   Bentsen, for example, who is accustomed to the leisurely pace of
Senate debate, spent days struggling _ with limited success _ to
distill his debating points into those punchy, quotable ``sound
bites'' that TV demands.
   About an hour into their debate, Bentsen unleashed what he had
learned. When Quayle summoned up the name of former President John
Kennedy, Bentsen stared and him and said sternly: ``You're no Jack
Kennedy.''
   The two warmed up with mild-by-comparison jabs over campaign
finances, but in general the two candidates stuck to carefully
scripted performances from the moment they strode onto the red,
white and blue decorated stage.
   Mike McCurry, press secretary for the 67-year-old Democratic
senator from Texas, said before the debate that Bentsen was having
trouble observing the strict time limits specified for the debate _
two-minute answers to questions and one-minute rebuttals.
   ``The red light goes off frequently,'' McCurry said.
   Quayle, 41, seems more comfortable in a TV setting, has been
coached by GOP nominee George Bush's media mastermind, Roger Ailes.
Deflecting reporters' questions about his debate strategy, the
Indiana senator said confidently that they should ``tune in and
find out.''
   During the debate, Quayle stood casually with one foot propped
on the podium, his face occasionally tightening when the audience
laughed at a defense of his environmental record and during several
tough questions tossed at him by panelists.
   The League of Women Voters withdrew as sponsors of the second
scheduled debate between Bush and Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis in Los Angeles in mid-October, complaining that campaign
strategists had turned the event into a ``charade'' by grabbing
tight control of the mechanics of TV coverage.
   Fouhy told reporters that restrictions demanded by the two
campaigns were minor. He said the biggest was the decision not to
show the audience of 2,000 people in the hall during the debate,
except for fuzzy, ``over the shoulder'' shots.
   `A lot of nonsense has been spoken and written about the
shots,'' Fouhy said. ``That's simply wrong. You direct a television
program so people watching at home have a good idea what's
happening.''
   Janet Brown, executive director of the bipartisan debate
commission sponsoring the Quayle-Bentsen clash, said it's natural
that both sides will fight hard for any advantage in a closely
fought presidential race.
   `I'm very pleased with all the arrangements,'' Ms. Brown said.
``It's been a helpful exchange, a productive exchange, it's been a
very honest exchange from all three parties.''
   Fouhy noted that the first Bush-Dukakis debate on Sept. 25 was
viewed by an estimated 35 million households. He said details of
the staging are crucial because ``millions of people are going to
watch this debate on television.''
   The intense interest in this year's campaign has put the
smallest details of the debates under scrutiny. Debate rules, for
example, allow only a three-inch variation in the height of the
candidates' lecterns. The final decision is made after each
candidate makes his allotted one-hour visit to the hall, closed to
reporters, a few hours before the debate begins.
   Little appearing on camera has been left to chance. Even the
journalists on the debate panel _ NBC's Tom Brokaw, Jon Margolis of
the Chicago Tribune and ABC's Britt Hume _ drew lots to determine
the order in which they asked questions.
   Fouhy said moderator Judy Woodruff of public broadcasting's
MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour will use gentle persuasion rather than
cutting off the microphones of any candidate who talks beyond his
time limit.
   Though the main floor of the Civic Auditorium was turned into a
large TV studio for the debate, the scene was much more informal
one level below, where most of the 1,500 reporters covering the
debate could watch on TV monitors.

   Moderator: Jon Margolis, a question for Sen Quayle.
   Q: Sen. Quayle, I want to go back to the matter
   of qualifications, which I think for most people is more than
just
   -- more than just your -- how long you've been in the Senate --
   Quayle: Jon, we can't hear you.
   Q: You can hear now?
   I want to go back to the question of qualifications, which I
think for most people is more than just how long you've been in the
Senate and how long you've been in public life. There's also a
question of candor and of consistency. And several of the things
you've said, both here and earlier, I think have raised some
reasonable questions.
   Each of them alone might seem rather trivial, but I think
together they create a pattern that needs to be asked. You've
talked a few times today about the Job Training Partnership Act,
which you authored. In fact, I believe you co-authored it with
another senator whom you almost never name. Earlier in the
campaign, when you were asked why you got a very -- a desk job in
the National Guard, after being trained as a welder -- you said, at
the time, you had a very strong background in journalism, which at
that time was summer jobs at your family-owned newspaper (about)
which you have not been very forthcoming about what they were, as
you have not been very forthcoming about your college record. Now,
you'll have to say -- you have, at least the males on this panel
have earlier agreed that your record was probably comparable to
ours.
   But, nonetheless, these examples of sort of overstatement and
exaggeration, and not being forthcoming, this is what has led a lot
of people to question this part of your qualifications. Not your --
not your experience, but your character. Would you like to set some
of these things straight now, as to what you did in your summer
jobs in college, what your grades were like, and would you like to
identify your co-sponsor of the Job Training Partnership Act.
   Quayle: All in two minutes?
   Q: Sure.
   Quayle: Let me -- let me start with the underlying premise that
somehow I haven't been straight forward, and I have, and let's go
-- right to the very first question: The Job Training Partnership
Act. I was the author of that. The co-author in the United States
Senate was Sen. Kennedy. I was the chairman of the employment and
productivity subcommittee _ chairman of the committee _ write (sic)
that legislation. Chairman of the committee write (sic) the
legislation, and then they go out and get co-sponsorship. And when
you are the chairman of the committee, and you sit down and you
write the legislation, you are the author of that.
   And I'm proud to have been the author of that, because you know
what we had, we had a CETA program, that spent $50 billion dollars
-- from about 1973 through 1982. And when we concluded that program
-- when we concluded that program, unemployment was higher than
when it began. It was a program that didn't work, and the Job
Training Partnership Act does work.
   Now, the issue of releasing all of my grades. I am, and I stand
before you tonight, as the most investigated person ever to seek
public office. Thousands of journalists have asked every professor
I've had, all my teachers, and they know -- and I've never
professed to be anything but an average student. I have never said
that I was anything more than that, but it's not whether you're an
average student, it's what are you going to do with your life? And
what am I going to do with my life? I have committed it to public
service since I was 29 years of age: Elected to the House of
Representatives, elected to the United States Senate when I was 33,
and now ....
   Moderator: Senator? Sen. Bentsen?
   Bentsen: I have absolutely no quarrel with Sen. Quayle's
military record, but I do strongly disagree with him on some of the
issues. You make great patriotic speeches, and I enjoy them. But I
don't understand your vote on veterans' issues. Sen. Quayle has one
of the worst voting records in the United States Senate on
veterans' issues. And one of them that particularly bothers me,
sponsoring legislation to put a tax on combat pay and disability
pay for veterans, for fighting men and women of America _ tax on
disability pay when lying there in the hospital, people who have
sacrificed for our country. I think you ought to explain that to
the people of America, and you ought to explain it tonight.
   Moderator: Jon, a question for Sen. Bentsen.
   Q: Senator, you're chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and
you're generally considered rather an orthodox conservative on
fiscal matters, meaning someone who would be very concerned about
the budget deficit. With everybody in politics afraid even to
mention taxes or Social Security cuts or even very much restraint
in defense spending, would you now list a few specific programs
which would reduce or eliminate -- which you would reduce or
eliminate to cut the deficit by about $50 billion, the deficit
which is expected to be about $135 billion this fiscal year?
   Bentsen: One of them that I'd work on, and I do this as a
farmer, I'd try to turn the situation around where we have seen the
subsidy payments go from two and a half billion to ten times that
under this administration. And the way I would accomplish that was
with a tough trade policy -- opening up those markets, getting
those prices back up to market prices. We can do that if we have an
aggressive trade policy for our country, if we make trade a number
one priority and not trade it off for some foreign policy objective
of the moment. That means we have to stand up for the American
farmers, and that cuts back on the regulation on American farmers.
   That's a positive way to accomplish that. In addition to that,
we'd do some of the things that I think have to be done insofar as
doing a better job of procurement, particularly when we're talking
about some of our military things that we should buy. I know that
I've fought very hard to put in an independent inspector general
for the Defense Department, but the senator from Indiana opposed me
on that.
   But we were finally able to put that into effect, and we saved
over a quarter of a billion dollars this year -- almost enough to
buy a squadron of F16s. Those are the kinds of things that I'd work
on, and one of the things I learned in business is that you can
expect what you inspect. So we'd be doing a much tougher job of
auditing to try to get rid of some of these kickbacks to
consultants on military contracts, to be much more aggressive on
that. In addition, those types of things would bring the interest
rate down. I'd try to turn this trade deficit around and that too
would help us and help us very substantially.
   And I'd get rid of some things like these planes that you're
going to have that the Administration wants that will fly from New
York to Tokyo and take those investment bankers over there in four
hours. I don't think we can afford a piece of technological
elegance like that. I'd strike that sort of thing from the ticket.
I don't know how many people have ridden the Concorde. Not many.
But I voted against it (and) said it would be a financial disaster,
and it's been just that. So those are the types of things that I
would work on.
   Moderator: Sen. Quayle.
   Quayle: The way we're going to reduce this budget deficit -- and
it is a challenge to make sure that it is reduced -- is first to
stick to the Gramm-Rudman targets. The Gramm-Rudman targets have
worked. We've reduced the federal budget deficit $70 billion.
Senator Bentsen voted against Gramm-Rudman -- the very tool that
has been used to bring the federal budget deficit down.
   We're going to need all the tools possible to bring this federal
budget deficit down. We need the tools of a line-item veto. A
line-item veto that 43 Governors in this country have, but not the
President of the United States. The president of the United States
needs to have a line-item veto when Congress goes ahead and puts
into appropriations bills unrequested and unecessary spending. Let
the president put a line through that, send it back to the
Congress, and the let the Congress vote on it again. Congress has
got to help out in reducing this budget deficit as much as the
executive branch.

   Moderator: Tom Brokaw, a last question for Senator Bentsen.
   Q: Senator Bentsen, I'd like to ask you about your split
personality during this election year. You're running on a ticket
with Michael Dukakis, a man who is opposed to the death penalty, a
man who is in favor of gun control and at the same time, you're
running for the United States Senate in the state of Texas where
your position on many of those same issues is well known and
absolutely opposed to him. How do you explain to the people of
Texas how you can be a social conservative on those cutting issues
and still run with Michael Dukakis on the national ticket?
   Bentsen: Michael Dukakis wasn't looking for clone. I think it's
part of the strength and the character of this man that he reaches
out and that he wants someone that will speak up, and that I'll do.
I've seen many chief executives come into my office and say,
they're going over and tell the president of the United States off,
they're going to pound the desk, and go into that office and turn
to jello. Now, I dealt with many a president, and I don't hesitate
for a minute to speak up.
   But when you're talking about something like the death penalty,
where Michael Dukakis and I do disagree, what you really ought to
get to is what's being done against crime and what kind of progress
he's been able to make. In the state of Massachusetts, he has the
homicide rate down to the lowest of any industrial state. It's
substantially ahead of the national average. He's been able to do
that with a educated program for the people of that state by adding
some 15-hundred new police officers. He's done it in turn by the
leadership that I think he will bring to the ticket when he becomes
president of the United States. And fighting drugs, he's taken it
down some 4 percent in the high schools of that state while it's
gone up around the rest of the nation.
   But you would see him as president of the United States being
very aggressive in this fight against crime and having that kind of
a successful result. And that's one of the reasons I'm delighted
and proud to be on the ticket with him. Sure we have some
differences, but overall we have so many things we agree on. This
situation of a trade policy, of cutting back on the deficit, those
are positive, plus things and major issues facing our nation.
   Moderator: Senator Quayle?
   Quayle: One of the things that they don't agree on is in the
area of national defense, national defense and how we're going to
preserve the freedom in this country. Michael Dukakis is the most
liberal national Democrat to seek the office of presidency since
George McGovern.
   He is for, he is against the MX missile, the Midgetman, cutting
two aircraft carriers. He is opposed to many defense programs that
are necessary to defend this country. That's why former Secretary
of Defense and former Energy Secretary in the Carter administration
Jim Schlesinger in an open letter to Time magazine asked Governor
Dukakis, ``Are you viscerally anti-military?'' Jim Schlesinger
never got an answer and the reason he didn't is because the
governor of Massachusetts doesn't want to answer former Secretary
Jim Schlesinger on that very important question.
   Moderator: Tom, a last question for Senator Quayle.
   Q: Senator Quayle, all of us in our lifetime encounter an
experience that help shapes our adult philosophy in some form or
another. Could you describe for this audience tonight what
experience you may have had and how it shaped your political
philosophy?
   Quayle: There are a lot of experiences that I've had that have
shaped my adult philosophy, but the one that I keep coming back to
time and time again, and I talk about at commencement addresses, I
talk about it in the high schools, I talk about it when I visit the
job training centers, and it's the advice that my maternal
grandmother Martha Pulliam, who's 97 years old _ we are a
modern-day four-generation family. The informa-, the advice that
she gave me when I was growing up is advice that I've given my
children and I've given to a number of children, a number of
people, and it's very simple, it's very common sense. And she says
``You can do anything you want to if you just set your mind to it
an go to work.''
   Now the Dukakis supporters sneer at that, because it's common
sense. They sneer at common sense advice, Midwestern advice,
Midwestern advice from a grandmother to a grandson, important
advice, something that we ought to talk about, because if you want
to, you can make a difference. You, America, can make a difference.
You're going to have that choice come this election. Everyone can
make a difference if they want to.
   Moderator: Senator Bentsen?
   Bentsen: I think being born and reared on the Rio Grande, to
have spent part of my life seeing some of the struggles that have
taken place in one of the lowest per capita incomes in the United
States, and that's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to try to
assist on education. And when I found that the bankers in that area
found that they could not handle the loans because of some of the
detail and the expense, couldn't make a profit on it, I went down
there and helped form a non-profit organization to buy up those
loans from them and to manage them, and do it in a way where they'd
continue to make those loans.
   Now they have, and they've educated more than 20,000 of those
students, loaned out over $100 million. And it hasn't cost the
taxpayers of this country one cent. It's one of the reasons I've
worked so hard to bring better health care to the people, because
what I've seen in the way of poverty down there in that area, and
the lack of medical attention, and trying to see that that's turned
around, why I worked so hard on the welfare reform bill, to give
them a chance to break these cycles of poverty, the chance for a
step up in life.
   Moderator: Senator.
   Bentsen: Judy, something's happened, but my light's still on.

   Bentsen: All right.
   Moderator: We're sorry about that, if that's the case.
   Bentsen: Okay.
   Moderator: Thank you. Thank you, Senator Bentsen. Thank you,
Senator Quayle. We have now come to the end of the questions. And
before I ask the candidates to make their closing remarks, on
behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I'd like to thank
all of you for joining us. Senator Quayle, yours is the first
closing statement.
   Quayle: Thank you. Tonight has been a very important evening.
You have been able to see Dan Quayle as I really am, and how George
Bush and I want to lead this country into the future. Thank you,
America, for listening, and thank you for your fairness.
   Now you will have a choice to make on election day. You will
have a choice of whether America is going to choose the road of
Michael Dukakis or the road of George Bush as we march toward the
21st century. The road of Michael Dukakis comes down to this:
bigger government, higher taxes _ they've always believed in higher
taxes, they always have and they always will _ cuts in national
defense. Back to the old economics of high interest rates, high
inflation and the old politics of high unemployment.
   Now, the road of George Bush is the road to the future and it
comes down to this: an America second to none, with visions of
greatness, economic expansion, tough laws, tough judges, strong
values, respect for the flag and our institutions. George Bush will
lead us to the 21st century, a century that will be of hope and
peace. Ronald Reagan and George Bush saved America from decline. We
changed America. Michael Dukakis fought us every step of the way.
It's not that they're not sympathetic. It's simply that they will
take America backwards. George Bush has the experience, and with
me, the future -- a future committed to our family, a future
committed to the freedom. Thank you, good night and God bless you.

   Moderator: Senator Bentsen -- Senator Bentsen, your closing
statement.
   Bentsen: In just 34 days America will elect new leadership for
our country. It's a most important decision, because there's no
bigger job than governing this great country of ours and leading it
into its future. Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen offer you
experienced, tempered, capable leadership to meet those challenges
of the future. Our opposition says, ``Lower your sights, rest on
your laurels.'' Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen think America can do
better. But America can't just coast into the future, clinging to
the past. This race is too close. The competition is too tough. And
the stakes are too high.
   Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen think America must move into
that future united in a commitment to make this country of ours the
most powerful, the most prosperous nation in the world. As
Americans we honor our past, and we should. But our children are
going to live in the future. And Mike Dukakis says the best of
America is yet to come. But that won't happen -- taking care of our
economy -- just putting it on automatic pilot. It won't happen by
accident, it's going to take leadership and it's going to take
courage, and the commitment and a contribution by all of us to do
that.
   I've worked for the betterment of our country, both in war and
peace, as a bomber pilot, as one who has been a businessman and a
United States senator, working to make this nation the fairest and
the strongest and the most powerful in the world. Help us bring
America to a new era of greatness. The debate has been ours, but
the decision is yours. God bless you.
   Moderator: Thank you both. Thank you.

   Michael Dukakis on Wednesday accused George Bush
of politically exploiting one ``tragic'' case involving a
Massachusetts furlough program, said campaign momentum has shifted
to him and promised ``five long, tough, aggressive weeks'' up to
the election.
   The Democratic presidential nominee also praised the performance
of his running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, in the vice presidential
nominee's debate Wednesday night with Republican Dan Quayle.
   ``The most important qualification for the vice president is
that he's ready at a moment's notice to assume the presidency of
the United States,'' Dukakis told a rowdy rally with supporters
shortly after the debate. ``Tonight Lloyd Bentsen demonstrated that
he was the only one on that stage who's ready.''
   Dukakis, who spoke to Bentsen immediately after the debate, said
the Democrat's performance should tell the American people ``about
how I make presidential decisions and the way George Bush makes
presidential decisions.''
   ``Tonight that was no contest,'' he said.
   Earlier, Dukakis used the debate to joke about the beginning of
the American League playoff series between the Boston Red Sox and
the Oakland Athletics.
   ``Our campaign is picking up steam,'' Dukakis told a news
conference at the Massachusetts Statehouse, where he spent a day
off the campaign trail catching up on gubernatorial duties. ``You
can sense it. You can feel it. And I think it's because the
American people want to move forward.''
   Republican nominee Bush has made his criticism of a
Massachusetts furlough program a staple of his campaign and on
Wednesday night aired a new television ad accusing Dukakis of
running a ``revolving door'' prison system. At the center of Bush's
attacks is a case in which an inmate on furlough raped a Maryland
woman and assaulted her fiance.
   Dukakis, who earlier this year signed legislation tightening
eligibility requirements for the program, said Bush was exploiting
that case despite a comparable federal program.
   ``The vice president's record on crime and the fight against
drugs is pathetic,'' Dukakis said. ``It's been a failure and in my
judgment this is an effort to use the one case with a tragic
occurrence for political reasons. The vice president knows that the
federal government has a very extensive furlough program, knows
that Governor Reagan in California in the 70s had a very extensive
furlough program and tragedies as a result of that.''
   That answer came in response a question about suggestions by
Texas Democrats that Dukakis was trailing in that key state despite
have a Texan running mate because he had not responded forcefully
enough to Bush's attacks on crime, gun control and other issues.
   Dukakis promised he would return the salvos soon, and aides said
they would come as soon as Thursday, when Dukakis planned to visit
Texas with Bentsen.
   ``We have five, long, tough, aggressive weeks to go and believe
me we'll be tough and aggressive in Texas and across this country
and I think we're going to beat them in Texas,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis also defended his new ads portraying Bush as an
issue-less candidate controlled by advisers.
   ``I wanted to express the very strong feeling that I have and
that I think many have that the Bush campaign is essentially a
packaged candidacy and it's important for people to understand
that,'' said Dukakis.
   A new set of 30-second ads to be aired nationally starting
Wednesday made a more direct attack on Bush and his record on drug
enforcement, education, the environment and Social Security. The
four ads said the administration dealt secretly with Manuel Antonio
Noriega, ``the Panamanian drug lord,'' Bush ``personally'' weakened
environmental regulations, ``personally'' cast the tie-breaking
vote to cut Social Security'' and ``sat by while college loans for
working families were cut.''
   The governor also rejected assertions by a former Iranian
official that the Democratic nominee had an emissary seeking to
establish a line of communication with Iran and said he hoped the
former official's assertion that Bush had an aide involved in
hostage negotiations was untrue.
   ``I would hope that, and I believe, that these efforts to
release the hostages have nothing to do with this campaign,''
Dukakis said. ``These families and these hostages have been through
too much pain and too much agony and too much tragedy as it is. ...
Certainly nobody representing me or someone authorized by me is
engaged in those kind of discussions.''
   As for the debate, Dukakis opened his news conference by saying
it was a day ``that we've been waiting a long time for.''
   Dukakis, seemingly discussing the debate, said he was ``a little
nervous'' and that he had been told by aides to try to lower
expectations.
   ``I'm rejecting the advice of my staff,'' Dukakis said as
reporters leaned forward for his prediction. ``The Red Sox are
going to win.''
   His prediction proved wrong. The Red Sox lost 2-1.
   On a more serious note, Dukakis said he expected Bentsen to ``do
himself and the Democratic ticket proud.''

   Emperor Hirohito's temperature remained well above
normal early Thursday and doctors gave him another blood
transfusion to counteract internal bleeding, palace officials said.
   The 87-year-old Hirohito, who fell ill when he vomited blood
Sept. 19, received four-tenths of a pint of blood in the
transfusion Thursday morning, officials said.
   He received 0.63 pints of blood from two transfusions Wednesday,
said Kenji Maeda, head of the general affairs department of the
Imperial Household Agency. The world's longest-reigning living
monarch has received 11.98 pints since falling ill.
   Maeda told reporters the emperor's temperature was 100.58
Thursday morning. Wednesday morning his fever was 98.6 and
increased to 100.94 in the afternoon.
   Hirohito has not been able to consume solid food except for a
few spoonfuls of porridge. He is being fed intravenously.
   Crown Prince Akihito, Princess Michiko, and their two sons
visited Hirohito at his palace home Wednesday. Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita visited Akihito at his Togu Palace.
   The emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of
Japan.

   For three decades, serious mishaps at the
Savannah River nuclear weapons plant were kept secret for national
security reasons and in some cases not reported to Washington,
according to federal officials who are trying to change that
attitude.
   One senior Energy Department official has compared the approach
to safety at the Savannah River Plant, near Aiken, S.C., to that
which led to the explosion of the shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28,
1986.
   And one member of Congress says the facility, which has been
closed since August, should not be allowed to reopen until the
situation improves.
   An Energy Department spokesman, Will Callicott, said that since
the federal government began making atomic weapons in World War II,
``there has always been a mind set, a culture, that we are doing
work that is important for national security and perhaps that may
override any obligation toward public accountablility.

   A simple urine test that detects bladder cancer
at a treatable stage may be used to help diagnose prostate and some
of the other cancers that afflict nearly a million Americans
annually, researchers say.
   The test detects a protein associated with the spread of tumors,
said Dr. Raouf Guirguis of the National Cancer Institute. The
protein also has been found in patients with kidney cancer,
prostate cancer and a nervous system cancer called neuroblastoma.
   ``It seems to be in all the cancers we have screened,'' Guirguis
said.
   Existing tests to diagnose bladder cancer, involving removal of
tissue, pose risk, are often painful and sometimes do not detect
the cancer until it has spread and can no longer be cured, the
cancer institute said.
   But Guirguis, Elliott Schiffman and colleagues, whose study is
published in today's Journal of the National Cancer Institute, said
their test can identify bladder cancer at an early, treatable stage.

   Supporters of a bill to impose tougher
restrictions on textile imports, after failing to override
President Reagan's veto, promise to renew their efforts when
Congress returns next year.
   ``We'll be back,'' Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., said Tuesday
after the House voted 272-152 to override Reagan's veto but fell 11
votes short of the two-thirds needed to enact the measure over his
objections.
   The action appeared to close the book on the battle for textile
legislation this year, with two weeks at most remaining before
lawmakers adjourn to campaign full time.
   The bill, designed to protect American industry from foreign
competition, would freeze current textile and apparel imports at
1987 levels and limit future increases to 1 percent annually. The
same would apply to non-rubber footwear except that no future
growth would be allowed.

   A Congress split by economic and regional
differences has proven again that cleaning up air pollution from
vehicle tailpipes and industrial smokestacks remains the nation's
toughest environmental problem.
   Only once since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970 has
Congress been able to agree on major amendments to strengthen the
basic law, and that occurred 11 years ago.
   Two years ago, environmentalists in the House and Senate renewed
the campaign to escalate the battle against urban smog, acid rain
caused by coal-burning factories and power plants and toxic fumes
from chemicals.
   On Tuesday, they tossed in the towel, vowing to try again next
year.
   ``There has not been sufficient willingness to compromise,''
said Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine, who spent much of 1988 trying
to put together a consensus on a clean air bill. ``As a result, we
will do nothing.''
   Mitchell, citing this summer's smog alerts around the country,
said the technology exists to control air pollution. ``All we lack
is the political will to do so.''

   Political parties are wrangling over a
wiretapping scandal dubbed the ``Israeli Watergate'' but are
speaking little of the Palestinian uprising as a critical election
campaign enters its home stretch.
   The quarrel over claims of wiretapping came Tuesday at the
conclusion of the Jewish High Holidays. It ended weeks of subdued
campaigning for the Nov. 1 Parliamentary elections that will
determine the future make-up of the government.
   Officials of the right-wing Likud bloc accused the
left-of-center Labor Party of bugging Likud campaign headquarters
and wiretapping the home phone of Likud's campaign chairman Moshe
Arens. They demanded that Attorney General Yosef Harish
investigate, but he reserved decision, according to Israel radio.
   Likud spokesman Danny Naveh said he had ``serious suspicions
that this is an Israeli Watergate,'' referring to the scandal that
forced then-President Richard Nixon to resign in 1974.
   Asked about evidence, Naveh said Arens heard clicking on his
telephone line and the minister's wife saw prowlers in her yard
last week.

   Organizers scorned criticism of the staging
of Wednesday night's debate between Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen as
``a lot of nonsense'' which ignores the reality that the event is
essentially a television show.
   Ed Fouhy, executive producer of the 90-minute confrontation

business to fret about such seemingly trivial details as camera
angles and the height of lecterns on the stage of the Omaha Civic

   The White House denied Wednesday that
intelligence authorizations signed by President Reagan in the
mid-1980s gave CIA agents latitude to use assassinations in the
fight against terrorism.
   Reagan said he was ``quite upset'' about a published report
saying there had been such authorizations and said his 1981
executive order prohibiting assassinations ``continues until this
day.''
   White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged that
language in two intelligence findings in 1984 and 1985 subsequently
was rescinded by the National Security Council, though he wouldn't
say why.
   Reagan's spokesman took strong exception to a Washington Post
report Wednesday which said phrasing in the earlier documents
amounted to a ``license to kill'' for intelligence agents.

   Since 1981, CBS' ``Simon & Simon'' has led a
charmed life, or a star-crossed one, depending on how you look at
it.
   It's the eighth season for this odd-couple detective series. The
show's been up, down and around. It was a flop its first time out,
and CBS renewed it only at the eleventh hour. Then it became a hit,
until it ran into ``The Cosby Show'' and NBC's Thursday night
juggernaut.
   There was even a brouhaha a few years ago when CBS tried to move
the show's locale from San Diego to Los Angeles. San Diego, still
smarting over the loss of ``Harry O.,'' mounted a postcard campaign
that caused CBS to back down.
   ``They've been beating on us for eight years,'' said Gerald
McRaney, who co-stars with Jameson Parker as brother detectives.
``They can't get us down for the count. I think the show has
survived for the most part because we've got good scripts. And we
don't take ourselves too seriously.
   ``The relationship between the brothers and the notion of a
family make it work. That would have worked in Elizabethan theater.
Loyalty and integrity. People like to see those values reaffirmed.''
   ``Simon & Simon,'' which returns Saturday, tells the story of
two brothers who are unalike, yet supportive of each other. McRaney
is Rick, rough, eccentric, laid back, who'd rather pluck his guitar
and have fun. Parker is A.J., conservative, a snappy dresser, whose
ambition and hard work keeps their detective agency on track.
   ``A lot of detective shows steer clear of comedy,'' said
McRaney. ``That makes us one of the few one-hour comedy shows on
the air. We do a few serious episodes. But we have a sibling
rivalry, and that's what makes it fun.
   ``From the beginning, Jameson and I participated in shaping the
show. We weren't just hired help. The creator, Philip DeGuere,
wanted us to be a part of it. I've directed five shows and written
one. We read through the scripts every week and our suggestions are
listened to seriously.''
   The show was originally set in Florida and was called ``Pirate's
Key.'' That was before ``Miami Vice,'' and neither Universal
Television nor CBS was too keen on filming it in Florida. The
locale was changed to San Diego, although most of the show is
filmed in Los Angeles.
   Mary Carver, who plays mother to the pair, is still with the
series. But other cast members have come and gone as the show has
changed through the years. Jeannie Wilson and Eddie Barth from the
original cast have left, as has Tim Reid, who was Detective
Downtown Brown. Reid stars in ``Frank's Place'' on CBS.
   This summer, McRaney worked on two TV movies. ``The People
Across the Lake,'' a Gothic mystery co-starring Valerie Harper, was
shown on NBC this past Monday.
   He also took a small role in the CBS movie ``Where the Hell's
the Gold?'' so he could spend some time with his fiancee, Delta
Burke of ``Designing Women.'' The Western comedy also stars Willie
Nelson and Jack Elam.
   ``We shot it in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico,''
said McRaney, who has a second home in Telluride, Colo. ``We used a
narrow-gauge railroad which runs through some beautiful country. My
ambition is to rob the Durango & Silverton Railroad from horseback.
My partner and I want to take a dollar from the engineer.''
   McRaney is also at work creating a new comedy series for himself
for that day when ``Simon & Simon'' finally does come to an end. He
also has a script for himself and Miss Burke for a lighthearted
mystery set in New Orleans. They spent a month in New Orleans this
summer and spent a week on the Mississippi Queen riverboat.
   Wedding plans are indefinite, but Miss Burke, who's from
Florida, and McRaney, from Mississippi, do want to tie the knot in
an old Southern plantation house.

<HEAD>For Indian Surgeon, the Impossible Dream Comes True</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1969, like thousands of other bright,
young Indian professionals, Naresh Trehan went abroad to further
his education.
   In less than two decades, he was one of the top heart surgeons
in New York City with an income of $1.5 million a year, an
apartment on Fifth Avenue, a beach-front house on Long Island and
two cars in the garage.
   He wanted to come home, to bring his wife and two children back
to their own country, but his professional achievements and
aspirations had reached too high. During exploratory trips back to
India, he found no place where he was willing to work.
   So he set out to fulfill a new dream: a world-class heart
hospital in India, equipped with state-of-the-art computers and
staffed with Indians who had set career goals their country could
not accommodate.
   His Indian dream became a reality when the 170-bed Escorts Heart
Institute and Research Center opened in New Delhi in mid-September.
   ``It's like climbing a new mountain,'' the 42-year-old Trehan
said. ``It's a passion for me to come back and train others.''
   In New York, Trehan performed heart bypass operations and heart
transplants. He was director of cardiovascular surgery at the
Manhattan Veterans Administration Hospital, and he remains an
assistant professor of surgery at New York University.
   Some years at least 10 percent of his patients were fellow
Indians. Trehan reasoned that wealthy Indians who go abroad for
heart surgery would pay comparable prices for the same quality of
treatment at home _ while saving the cost of air fare and the
hassle of travel.
   Their fees would help offset free or subsidized treatment for
others.
   Trehan enlisted a wealthy industrial family to help bankroll the
new hospital, whose start-up cost was budgeted at $20 million and,
according to Trehan, will probably rise. News of the project spread
by word of mouth among Indian doctors working in the United States
and Western Europe.
   ``I was always thinking that we could do it here,'' said Dr.
Sunil Sharma, who quit a job at George Washington University
Hospital in Washington, D.C., to become the Escorts center's chief
bacteriologist and infection control officer.
   Sharma, 33, declined to disclose present salary but said it is
about one-tenth of what he made in Washington.
   The main attraction, he said, was the chance to live and work
among his own people.
   ``The standard of living is so high abroad, but we are more
emotionally attached to our patients here,'' Sharma said. ``In the
States, everybody is afraid of malpractice (suits), but here we
treat from the core of our hearts.''
   Of the 30 doctors now on staff at Escorts, 12 have returned from
abroad.
   There were more mundane problems to deal with in establishing
the new heart center.
   ``This hospital is going to be 100 percent fly-proof,'' Trehan
declared as he strode across the polished-stone lobby to the front
door where a powerful downdraft of air from the ceiling thwarts
entry of flies and mosquitos.
   Flies seem to be a standard part of hospital life in India,
along with families who camp in the courtyards and hallways, cook
meals and try to keep track of a noisy assortment of half-naked
children.
   At J.P. Narain Hospital, one of New Delhi's largest, it is
possible to walk in off the street and wander through corridors and
wards without being questioned. People lie on the floors, and
barefoot women in tattered saris flail the hallways with twig
brooms that stir up dust without sweeping it away.
   At the Escorts center, security guards check visitors for passes.
   ``We are training our staff to a totally different level,''
Trehan said. ``And for the first time, we have introduced a
housekeeping service similar to that in hotels.''
   A formula was reached with the government under which 40 percent
of all outpatients and 10 percent of all inpatients would be
treated free of charge. About 25 percent of the rest would be given
subsidized rates, while the rest would pay full costs.
   Trehan, as the center's executive director, will still perform
surgery and plans to work for free if patients can't afford his
bill. The other doctors had to agree to do the same.
   One of the hospital's first patients was Santosh Rani Arora, a
46-year-old widow. A bout with rheumatic fever 22 years ago left
her with a severe aortic disease that causes her heart valves to
leak.
   Surgery in 1970 and 1983 failed to solve the problem, according
to her sons Sunil and Anil, both government civil servants.
   The sons expressed concern about being able to afford Escorts'
charges, but Trehan told them they could pay $352 for an
angiography test that normally would cost about $463.
   Later, when the family had left, Trehan said he expected to
perform surgery on Mrs. Arora.
   ``I can forgo my fee,'' he said. ``I expect that we can help
them out with the rest, and they can come up with whatever they can
so we can recover the cost of some of the consumables (supplies and
medicine).''

<HEAD>Divisive Tax Reform Rekindles Scottish Nationalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scottish nationalists are counting on
a widely unpopular reform of property taxes to lift them out of a
decade-long spell in the cold.
   They talk of a Scottish-style Boston Tea Party, and while the
tax is not the trigger that will blast Scotland out of the United
Kingdom, it is helping to stoke what the Scotsman newspaper calls
``a creeping resurgence of nationalism.''
   The poll tax, as the sweeping reform is known, is central to
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's crusade against socialism and
high-spending left-wing local governments in Britain. But to many
Scots, it is a highhanded edict from a thoroughly English prime
minister who, they believe, has no mandate north of the border.
   The Scottish National Party, which seeks outright independence
for the 5.2 million Scots, is organizing a non-payment campaign.
The tax also is a springboard for the more broadly based movement
seeking devolution _ limited self-government under an elected
Scottish parliament.
   Scotland's yen to end the 281-year-old union with England has
always ebbed and flowed. In the mid-1970s it was powerful enough to
force a referendum on devolution, but collapsed when the referendum
failed to deliver a change.
   The Scottish Nationalist Party plummeted from 11 seats in the
650-member House of Commons in London to just two. But last year it
gained an extra seat, and made significant advances in the May
local elections. And while it has never commanded a plurality of
Scottish votes, polls consistently indicate that three-quarters of
Scots favor self-government.
   The 1970s surge was prompted by a sense that Scotland wasn't
getting enough revenue from its offshore oil boom.
   Now it's the poll tax, or community charge as the government
calls it, which takes effect in Scotland in April and will spread
to the rest of Britain a year later.
   Basically it shifts local taxation from property to people,
requiring each local authority to calculate its expenses, and
accordingly set a uniform sum to be paid by every resident over age
18.
   The government says it is fairer, simpler and makes local
government more accountable, because municipalities will no longer
be able to use funds collected from middle-class homeowners to
finance generous social programs for those who pay little or no tax.
   While replacing the property tax, the poll tax, expected to
average about 260 pounds ($340) a year per adult, is in addition to
the national income tax that Scots and all others in Britain must
pay.
   But the poll tax provides for 80-percent rebates for those with
low incomes.
   The government estimates one-third of Scots will receive
rebates, but a recent opinion poll reports 70-percent disapproval
of the poll tax, with 52 percent of Scots believing they will be
worse off and only 18 percent expecting to benefit.
   Judging by election results, Scotland doesn't share Mrs.
Thatcher's distaste for socialism. Her Conservative Party's share
of the Scottish vote has fallen from 50 percent in 1955 to 24
percent in last year's general election, and the party holds only
10 Scottish seats in Parliament, compared with the socialist
opposition Labor Party's 50.
   Scottish National Party lawmaker Alex Salmond calls non-payment
``the greatest moral and political challenge that the Tory
government has yet faced in Scotland.''
   But the Labor Party risks being upstaged by the Nationalists,
because it has voted not to espouse civil disobedience, fearing it
would appear unfit for government.
   A dozen of Labor's Scottish members of Parliament in London are
defying party policy, and one of them, Denis Kanavan, has already
been fined 50 pounds ($85) for refusing to register for the poll
tax.
   ``It's not good enough for Labor to tell people to stop the tax
through the ballot box,'' Kanavan said in an interview. ``We tried
that and won last year in Scotland, but we failed to stop it,''
   But opinion polls indicate that only 24 percent of Scots are
likely to refuse payment, and more than 90 percent have registered
for the tax.
   The litmus test is likely to come sometime this autumn or next
spring when Glasgow's Govan district holds a by-election to fill a
vacant parliamentary seat.
   The polls favor victory for Labor, whose candidate, Bob
Gillespie, is one of the rebels refusing to pay the tax. But
anything less than a crushing Labor victory will be seen as a boost
for the Scottish Nationalist Party, which is fielding Jim Sellars,
a former Laborite.
   The Nationalists' Scotland-wide support has risen from 17 to 23
percent in recent polls, and they believe that once poll tax
assessments start reaching Scottish households, that support will
soar.

<HEAD>Campaign '88: Parties' Fat Cats Are Back and Spending Big</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite Watergate-inspired curbs on election
spending, millions of dollars are pouring into Republican and
Democratic campaign treasuries from fat cat contributors this fall,
and it's all legal.
   Documents made available to reporters recently show that both
political parties are avidly courting the kind of big-money
donations that were tarnished by revelations of Watergate-era
abuses and then supposedly curtailed by election law reforms of the
1970s.
   The biggest Republican contributor is Nicholas Salgo, former
U.S. ambassador to Hungary, who was listed as giving more than
$500,000 to his party. The Democrats say a couple of unidentified
unions are giving $200,000 each.
   Both parties are going after individuals willing to give
$100,000 or more. The GOP claims it has 115 such givers so far in
the 1988 campaign. The Democratic National Committee counts 100 fat
cats, with a goal of doubling the number.
   These funds are known as ``soft money'' because federal law
prohibits unions and corporations from making direct contributions
to federal election campaigns, and limits individuals to giving
$1,000 in presidential primaries only.
   In the general election, the presidential nominees are forbidden
to accept any private donations because each receives $46.1 million
from a Treasury fund supported by the voluntary $1 checkoff on
individual income tax returns, plus $8.3 million from his party.
   So millions of dollars in soft money are funneled through the
parties to finance political activities at the state and local
level, which are not subject to federal regulation. Even at that
level, the parties have no trouble finding ways to use soft money
for activities, such as voter registration and TV commercials, that
clearly benefit their presidential candidates.
   ``What is happening in 1988 is, it's becoming clearer and
clearer (that) soft money is making a joke of the campaign finance
laws,'' said Ellen Miller, director of the Center For Responsive
Politics, a research organization that advocates tightening
campaign finance laws.
   The list of soft money receipts released by the Democrats, which
covers only June and July, included $4.8 million of about $15
million the party has raised in soft money so far.
   No public accounting of soft money is required, and the
Democrats say they will make no further fund-raising disclosures
until after the Nov. 8 elections.
   Robert Farmer, fund-raising chief for Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis and head of the ``Victory Fund,'' says the party has a $50
million goal this year, with about $20 million coming from
big-spending individuals.
   The GOP files showed $10 million in soft money raised through
mid-September but did not include details of an additional $16
million raised by a ``Victory 88'' operation and slated for
separate accounts in each state.
   Party officials say the Victory 88 goal is to raise $25 million
in the states, while another soft money program, ``Team 100,'' will
bring in about $15 million.
   Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee, frequently
attends glittery fund-raising events in banquet halls or private
homes to help bolster the GOP's ``Victory '88'' effort. Farmer
mines the telephone network of wealthy Democratic donors and
concentrates on big-ticket galas featuring Dukakis.
   While raising millions of dollars in soft money, the two major
parties are stretching the rules to the limit. But they nonetheless
are acting legally under guidelines which the Federal Election
Commission is under court order to tighten up.
   Despite the federal ban on direct contributions to the
candidates, party officials make support for Bush or Dukakis a big
part of their pitch to potential donors.
   ``We make it quite clear that they are not contributing to
Michael Dukakis,'' said Don Sweitzer, finance director for the
Democratic National Committee. ``Michael Dukakis is on the
Democratic ticket and therefore he benefits indirectly from these
funds. They're inspired by the head of the ticket to support the
entire ticket.''
   Florida developer Joe Zappala, co-chairman of Republicans' Team
100 group of $100,000 donors, said that ``when you talk about
George Bush, people are fairly receptive.''
   Zappala's tactic goes like this: ``You apprise people of the
cost to run an election. It's expensive. We tell them we are
running behind in fund raising. We don't want to lose an election
because we are running out of money.''
   The Democrats, traditionally the fund-raising underdogs, say
they have collected $38 million toward their $50 million goal this
year. Of that sum, Sweitzer said, about $15 million is in soft
money.
   Contrary to the ominous warnings in Zappala's pitch, the GOP
National Committee boasts $67 million in overall receipts so far
this year.
   Of that total, $13 million is soft money being raised in state
accounts toward a goal of $25 million, plus nearly $10 million that
has come from fat cat donors, pricey galas and the party's
``Eagle'' program of $10,000-per-year givers.
   Both parties say it's not easy persuading individuals to give
$100,000 or more, but there seem to be plenty of willing donors.
   ``People are surprised they can give that much,'' Zappala said.
``There's been a lot of concerns about the federal legal limits. We
explain to them it is legal.''

   More than 200 contributors have forked over
$100,000 or more to their favorite political party, as the
Republicans and Democrats compete for fat cat donations that skirt
federal election laws.
   The biggest GOP donor listed in documents recently released was
Nicholas Salgo, former U.S. ambassador to Hungary, who gave more
than $500,000.
   McDonald's heiress Joan Kroc gave the Democrats $1 million, a
contribution that isn't reflected in party records.
   The so-called ``soft money'' is being funneled into
state-related political activities that ultimately will benefit GOP
nominee George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis. Direct private
contributions to the candidates' general campaigns are forbidden
under federal law.
   The records show that on the corporate level, several companies
spread their wealth to both political parties. Among them,
Coca-Cola gave $50,000 to the Democrats and $75,000 to the
Republicans. Atlantic Richfield gave $35,000 to the Democrats and
$135,900 to the Republicans.
   Philip Morris gave the Republicans $36,350 and the Tobacco
Institute, the industry's lobbying organization, gave $17,500 to
the GOP. Both gave the Democrats $850 each.
   The American Medical Association gave the Democrats $31,375 and
the Republicans $25,000. Dow Chemical gave the Democrats $5,850 and
the Republicans $20,000. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. gave
the Democrats $425 and the Republicans $11,000.
   The Republicans received $18,650 from Southern Air Transport of
Miami, which figured in the Iran-Contra affair as the carrier used
by former White House aide Oliver North's secret network to ferry
arms and supplies to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Not all members of the GOP ``Team 100'' group of $100,000 givers
are reflected in the records because some may have given money
through state accounts which are kept separately, said Phil Smith,
finance director of the Republican National Committee.
   In the Democrats' $100,000 category were Eli Broad, Los Angeles;
Anne Cox Chambers, Atlanta; Richard D. Cohen, Boston; Mark B.
Dayton, Minneapolis; Richard J. Dennis, Chicago; Susie Field, Los
Angeles; Steven Grossman, Summerville, Mass., who gave $95,000;
Alan M. Leventhal, Boston; Raymond D. Nasher, Dallas; Ronald O.
Perelman, New York; Carl Rheuban, Los Angeles; Blanchette
Rockefeller, Washington; Linda and Howard Sterling, Los Angeles;
Bruce Sundlun, New York, and Lew Wasserman, Universal City, Calif.
   Unions and corporations that gave $100,000 to the Democrats
include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees; Great Western Resources of Houston; Machinists
Non-Partisan Political League of Washington, and the National
Education Association.
   For the Republicans, the $100,000 roster of individual givers
included Joy Silverman, New York; Trammell Crow, Dallas; Lawrence
Bathgate II, Lakewood, N.J.; David Murdock, Los Angeles; Janet
Silvestri Cafaro, Hubbard, Ohio; Howard Wilkins, Wichita, Kan., and
Melvin Sembler, Treasure Island, Fla..
   The GOP list of $100,000 corporate givers included Atlantic
Richfield of Los Angeles; Occidental Petroleum of Los Angeles; A.G.
Spanos Construction of Stockton, Calif., and R.J. Reynolds
Industries of Winston-Salem, N.C.
   The GOP had many receipts in the $50,000 to $100,000 range
including Dresser Industries of Dallas, Pepsico of Purchase, N.Y.,
and Kershaw & Associates of Boston.

   Here in brief are some 1988
presidential-election predictions by economists and other
academics, and how they came up with them:
   Data Resources Inc., an economic consulting firm in Lexington,
Mass., predicts Bush will win the election with 55 percent of the
vote. The DRI model studies economic growth and inflation in the 12
months before the election.
   Ray Fair, economics professor, Yale University, predicts Bush
will win with 51.8 percent of the vote. His model focuses on the
inflation rate for the two years before the election and per capita
economic growth for six to nine months before the election.
   Allan Lichtman, history professor, American University, predicts
a Bush victory based on answers to 13 yes-no questions on the
economy, the candidates' charisma and the record of the incumbent
party.
   Harold Zullow, psychology professor, University of Pennsylvania,
predicts a 5 percent victory margin for Dukakis. His model is based
on how optimistically the candidates address problems in their
acceptance speeches at the political conventions.

<TEXT>
   Fiat, Italy's largest auto maker, on
Wednesday confirmed printed reports that it is holding preliminary
talks with Chrysler Corp. aimed at exploiting the U.S. automaker's
extensive distribution network.
   Fiat officials emphasized that the commercial agreement being
considered would boost sales of Alfa Romeo models.
   Alfa Romeo, taken over by Fiat in January 1987, sells about
6,000 of its sportscars in the United States each year. It hopes to
sell 60,000 of its brand-new 164 sedan on the U.S. market by the
end of 1990.
   A Fiat spokesman denied the talks included any possible joint
venture to produce components. He also ruled out a possible
exchange of shares between the two companies.
   Fiat's relationship with Chrysler dates back to a number of
years. Chrysler was one of the first companies to install robots
supplied by a Fiat automation unit.

   The House narrowly has sustained President
Reagan's veto of a bill that would have tightened curbs on imports
of textiles and apparel.
   The House on Tuesday fell 11 votes short of the two-thirds
necessary to override the veto and turn the bill into law.
   Supporters said the measure would save jobs, but opponents said
it would mean price increases amounting to a fresh tax on consumers.
   The bill would have frozen 1988 textile, non-rubber footwear and
apparel imports at last year's level. It would have allowed a 1
percent annual increase in imports of footwear and apparel
beginning in January.

light trucks in the 1988 model year.
   Sales were up 0.7 percent from the 1987 model year, when 15.5
million were sold. The 1988 total does not include a few of the
small-volume foreign makers, which were scheduled to release

   Expectations were that sales would be flat or down slightly,

<HEAD>Oil Prices Steady, But Outlook Remains Bearish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Analysts say the outlook for crude oil futures
prices remains negative, despite recent stability.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. crude, rose 1 cent Tuesday to settle at $13.07 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract skidded 86 cents over Friday and Monday to $13.06 a
barrel, the lowest close for a near-term WTI contract since August
1986.
   Concerns about oversupply of crude have brought prices down by
about $2 a barrel over the past five weeks. Those concerns were
heightened Monday by Saudi Arabia's threat to step up its crude
output unless other members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries abide by their OPEC production quotas.
   Oil prices opened higher Tuesday amid rumors that OPEC would
move its ministerial meeting, scheduled for November, up to later
this month, said John Azarow, a trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc.
   An early meeting raises speculation over the prospect of an
agreement among OPEC members to rein in the cartel's production.
   But the rally, which analysts said was based on technical
factors, soon ran out of steam. The November crude contract went as
high as $13.30 a barrel before slipping back.
   ``We're still in a bear market,'' said Jim Fiedler, a trader
with E.D.&F. Man International Futures Inc. ``The market was
expecting a rally of up to the $13.70 level and they haven't been
able to get it.''
   Besides OPEC rumors, there was no news to affect trading,
analysts said.
   ``The main thing goes back to the concerns about the Saudi
overproduction,'' Fiedler said.
   Among refined products traded on the Mercantile Exchange, the
November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.87 cent to
41.11 cents a gallon, while home heating oil rose 0.39 cent to
38.17 cents a gallon.
   Azarow said some of the movement in refined products was due to
seasonal factors, such as a decline in driving that lowers demand
for gas and the onset of cooler weather that increases heating oil
use.

   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. hasn't yet
launched a formal hostile takeover of Kroger Co., but in sweetening
its buyout proposal for the supermarket giant it has outlined plans
to keep stepping up the buyout pressure.
   Kohlberg Kravis late Tuesday offered to pay $64 a share in cash
and securities for each of Kroger's 78.6 million outstanding
shares, an indicated total of $5.03 billion, and repeated its
request to meet with the Kroger board.
   The amount of the latest proposal topped not only the buyout
firm's previous offer of $58.50 a share, or about $4.6 billion, but
also the proposed $4.6 billion restructuring plan that Kroger's
board of directors approved last month to thwart any outside
takeover.
   Furthermore, Kohlberg Kravis indicated that if Kroger decided to
go through with the restructuring, the firm was willing to buy the
surviving company _ and it hinted Kohlberg also might be willing to
take its offer directly to Kroger shareholders.
   ``We have come forth with what we believe is an exceptional
offer for your company's shareholders and we are confident that, if
given the opportunity, your shareholders would embrace it,''
Kohlberg Kravis said in a letter to the board of Cincinnati-based
Kroger.
   Kohlberg Kravis announced its sweetened offer after the close of
stock trading Tuesday in New York. Kroger shares dipped 87{ cents
to $55.37{ a share in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The Kroger Company's management, legal and financial advisers
are reviewing the second unsolicited proposal from KKR,'' Paul
Bernish, a spokesman for Kroger, said late Tuesday. He said the
company had no further comment.
   Kroger has been resisting overtures from Kohlberg Kravis and the
Haft family of Maryland, which had offered $4.32 billion, or $55 a
share, for Kroger.
   Kohlberg Kravis specializes in leveraged buyouts _ purchases
made with mostly borrowed money that is repaid with funds from the
target company's operations or the sale of its assets.
   The firm rarely has engaged in an outright hostile takeover,
partly because the success of its deals often depends on having
existing management remain with the target company.
   But as its coffers have bulged with money from investors anxious
to participate in buyouts _ Kohlberg Kravis has an estimated $5.6
billion warchest that can be used as equity to leverage about seven
times that amount _ pressure has mounted for the firm to be more
aggressive in creating deals.
   Kohlberg Kravis' sweetened offer includes $50 in cash, $11 in
debt securities and $3 in stock of the new company that Kohlberg
Kravis would create from Kroger. The investment firm's earlier
offer contained the same cash portion of $50 but only $8.50 in
securities.
   Kroger's restructuring announced Sept. 13 would pay stockholders
a special dividend of $40 a share in cash, securities valued at $8
plus stock in the surviving company, valued at $5 to $10 a share.
   Kohlberg Kravis said that if Kroger undertook the plan, Kohlberg
would be willing to acquire the stock in the restructured company
for $13.50 a share _ $10 in cash and $3.50 a share in debentures.
As such, Kroger stockholders would realize a total of $61.50 a
share in cash and securities from both parties.
   The investment firm noted the alternative, post-retructuring
buyout would be for $2.50 a share less than its up-front offer, and
said the difference reflected its estimates of financing fees
Kroger would have to pay under the restructuring plan, plus
Kohlberg's added costs in financing Kroger debt incurred in the
restructuring.
   Kroger's restructuring also includes layoffs and the sale of
operations, in order to streamline the company and cut costs.
   Kroger operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 935 convenience
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states. The company also
processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside
customers.

<HEAD>Pillsbury Fighting Takeover Bid From Britain's Grand Met</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In launching a $5.17 billion bid for
Pillsbury Co., Britain's Grand Metropolitan PLC is proposing to
strip Pillsbury of a division that has helped make the company
vulnerable to a takeover.
   Grand Metropolitan said in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that if its $60-a-share bid begun Tuesday
succeeds, it would sell Pillsbury's Steak & Ale and Bennigan's
restaurant operations.
   The under-performing full-service restaurant division was
restructured in January, resulting in a $91 million charge that has
dragged down earnings. The restructuring also precipitated
management changes, including the hiring of former General Foods
Corp. chairman Philip L. Smith as its own new chairman in July.
   Grand Metropolitan indicated it would sell Steak & Ale and
Bennigan's because of state laws prohibiting a company from owning
both alcoholic beverage makers and retailers.
   Pillsbury is using that issue to challenge the takeover bid,
although by Tuesday it had not actually or approved of the offer.
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, Smith said Pillsbury had
sued to block the acquisition in 13 states, contending a buyout by
Grand Met would violate liquor laws prohibiting producers from
owning liquor retailers.
   Courts in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas,
Pennsylvania and Missouri have issued temporary restraining orders
enjoining Grand Met from acquiring any Pillsbury stock, and a
Delaware court has rejected Grand Met's effort to stop those
actions, Pillsbury said.
   Grand Met, a $10 billion a year diversified company, is one of
the world's biggest wine and spirit makers, with brands that
include Smirnoff Vodka, J&B Scotch, Gilbey's Gin, Watney and Ushers
ale and Almaden wines.
   In a separate statement, Pillsbury said that its board would
review the offer ``at an appropriate time.''
   Smith said at the company's annual shareholders' meeting in
September that one of his chief goals was keeping the company
independent. But on Tuesday, industry analysts doubted Pillsbury
could defend itself against the takeover bid and remain independent.
   Pillsbury stock soared by $18.50 a share to $57.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange Tuesday, the first trading session after Grand
Met made its offer.
   ``It's going to be a bid that Pillsbury management is going to
have difficulty defending against,'' said John M. McMillen, an
analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. ``I think
they'll fight it initially _ attempt to fight it _ but I think it's
a losing battle.''
   Ian A. Martin, Grand Metropolitan's chief executive for U.S.
operations, said Tuesday in Minneapolis that he is ``very
interested in doing this thing in a gentlemanly manner.''
   Pillsbury's struggling restaurant division, which includes the
Burger King fast-food chain, provides about half Pillsbury's $6.2
billion in annual revenue. Martin said Grand Metropolitan would
keep Burger King but would sell Distron, Pillsbury's in-house
distribution system for Burger King.
   London-based Grand Metropolitan also owns hotels, the Alpo pet
food company, Pearle vision centers, and a chain of betting offices
in England and Ireland.
   Analysts speculated Grand Metropolitan was most interested in
Pillsbury for its Green Giant vegetable, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and
Van de Kamp's frozen fish operations.
   Martin said there were good prospects for marketing Pillsbury's
food products overseas, especially its microwavable foods. Further,
Grand Metropolitan proposed in a letter to Smith that Minneapolis
become the headquarters of a Grand Met international foods group.
   Martin, who met with a number of state officials while waiting
for a response from Pillsbury, said Grand Metropolitan decided to
move aggressively with a tender offer because Pillsbury officials
had indicated that ``if anyone came near the drawbridge, they would
have a real cat-and-dog fight.''
   Grand Metropolitan filed suit on Monday in Delaware Chancery
Court to invalidate Pillsbury's ``poison pill'' takeover defense,
which would make a hostile merger prohibitively expensive.
Pillsbury is incorporated in Delaware.
   Pillsbury also might seek protection from Minnesota lawmakers,
who met in special session last year to pass legislation protecting
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp. from a possible hostile
takeover bid by the Haft family.

<HEAD>LTV Corp. Putting Steel Bar Division Up For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LTV Steel Co. of Cleveland, a subsidiary of
Dallas-based LTV Corp., plans to sell its Ohio-based steel bar
division as part of the parent company's reorganization under
federal bankruptcy laws.
   ``The company had indicated several months ago that it did not
intend to reorganize with what it considered marginally profitable
operations,'' said Joseph Coyle, director of the United Steel
Workers of America District 27.
   LTV Corp. has hired Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to help find a
qualified buyer for the division.
   Shearson also recently helped LTV Steel find a buyer _ Warren
Consolidated Industries Inc. _ for its Warren mill and its Republic
Drainage Products plant in Canton.
   LTV Steel's bar division employs about 5,400 salaried or hourly
workers, and the union represents about 4,200, with 3,200 at Ohio
operations in Canton and Massillon.
   Company representatives met Tuesday in Canton with public and
union officials.
   ``There's always uncertainty and some apprehension. The company
assured us it's their intention to sell to a purchaser with a
commitment to keep it profitable and more profitable in the
future,'' Coyle said.
   J. Peter Kelly, LTV Steel executive vice president, said at a
news conference following the meeting there was no deadline set for
a sale.
   ``The process will necessarily take a considerable period of
time,'' Kelly said. ``Precisely what that will be is impossible for
us to forecast, but it is nothing that is going to happen tonight,
next week or even next month.''
   Separate management, marketing, sales, customer service,
engineering and research operations already exist in the bar
division, LTV Steel President David H. Hoag said in a statement.
   ``The bar division is well positioned and prepared to operate
apart from LTV Steel,'' Hoag said. He described the division as a
leading producer of high quality carbon and alloy steel bars.
   Raymond A. Hay, LTV chairman and chief executive officer, said
the steel segment is trying to focus on flat-rolled and tubular
products.
   ``We have concluded that LTV Steel must focus its resources on
its large, modern flat-rolled facilities in order to maintain a
leadership position in production of high-quality, value-added
steels for critical engineering applications,'' Hay said in a
statement issued from Dallas.

<TEXT>
   NBC says it will offer buyouts to as many as 140
engineers and technicians in an effort to trim at least 40
employees from its work force.
   Dom Giofre, a spokesman for the television network, said the
buyout offer was prompted by the recent sale of NBC's radio
operation and by the winding down of 1988 political coverage.
   ``I don't think this really comes as a real surprise to
anyone,'' said Michael Sherlock, NBC President of Operations and
Technical Services.
   He said only employees in New York are involved.
   NBC has has dramatically reduced its payroll since it was
acquired by General Electric Co. two years ago.
   About 400 people in the news division have lost their jobs and
another 110 are scheduled to go before the end of the year.
   The engineers and technicians were scheduled to be notified
beginning today in a series of meetings with supervisors.
   ``If all 140 people accept, they will pay it, although they are
aiming to cut only 40 positions,'' said Paul McElroy, a spokesman
for Local 11 of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians.
   Workers will have until Nov. 10 to accept the voluntary offer.
   Those who accept will continue to receive regular paychecks as
well as health and other benefits through the end of the year. The
balance of the severance would be paid in a lump sum on Jan. 2,
Sherlock said.
   Currently, NBC employs about 1,000 technicians, down by 300
since a 118-day strike in 1987.

   America's growing love affair with light trucks
towed the auto industry to its third-best year on record, as car
makers reported selling 15.6 million vehicles in the 1988 model
year.
   The 0.7 percent increase over the 15.5 million vehicles sold
during the 1987 model year was fattened by strong sales of
U.S.-made light trucks, including pickups, minivans and sports
utility vehicles.
   The overall increase came despite a slight dip in sales of cars,
the automakers reported Tuesday.
   Foreign and domestic car makers reported car sales slipped 1.4
percent to about 10.4 million cars in the model year ended last
Friday from about 10.5 million cars sold during the year before.
   But sales of light trucks rose 4.2 percent to 5.1 million in
1988, from 4.9 million in the 1987 model year.
   Leading the way were U.S.-made trucks, rising to 4.4 million
vehicles this year, compared just less than 4 million last year, an
11.2 percent increase. Sales of light trucks made outside the
United States tumbled 24.9 percent to 724,584 vehicles in the 1988
model year from 961,465 in the year before.
   ``There has been a lot of competition for trucks on the domestic
and foreign side,'' said Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America
in San Francisco. ``That has...given the appearance and the
actuality that you can swing a good deal in that market.''
   But overall car sales have drooped. Industry leader General
Motors Corp. was the only loser among the Big Three in the 1988
model year, with sales of about 3.6 million U.S.-made cars between
Oct. 1, 1987 and Sept. 30, 1988, down 4.9 percent from the
3,719,267 domestically made cars it sold the year before.
   Ford Motor Co.'s sales rose 2.9 percent to 2.14 million cars in
1988 from 2.07 million in 1987. Chrysler Corp. sales rose 3 percent
to about 1.05 million cars in 1988 from 1.01 million during the
year before.
   Overall sales made it a stronger-than-expected model year, which
analysts had anticipated would see sales of about 15 million
vehicles or less.
   ``I think it's particularly surprising in light of what the
initial expectations were post-Oct. 19 of last year'' when the
stock market crashed, said analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear,
Stearns & Co. of New York.
   ``I was looking more for 14 million in that period. I had to
consistently raise it through the period,'' he said.
   The model year ended on a downturn for the automakers as
September sales of imported cars and trucks fell to 268,362
vehicles, down 16.6 percent from the 321,656 vehicles sold during
the same month last year.
   Sales of U.S.-made cars and trucks dipped 2.2 percent in
September, to 895,861 vehicles from 916,410 vehicles during
September 1987.
   GM showed the largest car sales decline in the Sept. 21-30
period, dropping 15 percent to 116,028 cars this year from 136,483
during the same period last year.
   Ford's late September sales fell to 70,813 cars, down 14.3
percent from 82,606 during the period last year.
   Chrysler's late-September sales dropped 4.5 percent to 33,314
cars this year from 34,898 last year.

<HEAD>Bidding War Expected For Oil Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Getty Petroleum Corp. executive says a bidding
war has erupted over bankrupt Clark Oil & Refining Corp., a leading
Midwest discount gasoline marketer.
   Stephen Salzman, Getty's senior vice president, said Tuesday
that his company plans to submit a bid for Clark and other assets
of Apex Oil Co. that will top the $650 million offered by
Toronto-based Horsham Corp.
   Salzman said Getty's proposal will be filed in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in St. Louis by late Monday. Getty is based in Jericho, N.Y.
   Bruce Walter, a Horsham vice president, promised a battle for
the company.
   ``It had been our intention to acquire Clark Oil,'' he said.
``We've invested a significant amount of time and money in
developing and structuring this transaction,'' he said. ``We will
not give up the fight easily.''
   Clark, acquired by Clayton, Mo.-based Apex Oil in 1981, owns
about 958 gas stations in 12 states as well as a dozen fuel
terminals and two small factories in Illinois.
   Under terms of a plan submitted in bankruptcy court five weeks
ago, a Horsham subsidiary would acquire Clark and other Apex
properties, including a Colorado ski resort, for cash and the
assumption of debt at a discount.
   Among Horsham's partners in the deal is Samuel Zell, the Chicago
investor whose burgeoning business empire includes Itel Corp.
   Zell said recently that he and Horsham want Clark because they
believe the refining and marketing business will be a steady
money-maker during a period of anticipated low oil prices.
   Under the timetable set by the bankruptcy court, the rival bids
will be reviewed next week. A full hearing on the purchase will be
held Oct. 31, when the judge could approve one of the proposals.

   The stock market was widely mixed today as
traders bided their time awaiting the latest government statistics
on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.38 to
2,090.68 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 458 up, 365 down and
508 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.77 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said nothing had taken place to stir the market out of
its recent lethargy.
   Traders have been leery of making big commitments for several
days now, awaiting Friday's report from the Labor Department on the
employment situation for September.
   Many analysts are projecting that the figures will show strong
job growth, which would presumably revive concerns at the Federal
Reserve and elsewhere about inflation.
   Kroger rose 3| to 58~ in active trading. The investment firm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. sweetened its buyout bid for the
company.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .07 to 152.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .61 at 299.01.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 3.20 to
2,102.06.
   Declines outnumbered advances by about 6 to 5 among issues
listed on the NYSE, with 636 up, 769 down and 527 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 157.76 million shares, against 130.38
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>McKesson Drops Plans to Acquire Alco, Northwestern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McKesson Corp., the nation's largest drug
distributor, has called off its proposed acquisition of Alco Health
Services Corp., the nation's third largest drug wholesaler.
   In Tuesday's announcement, the companies sited a decision by the
Federal Trade Commission to move to block the merger.
   McKesson offered $500 million in June for Alco, based in Valley
Forge, Pa., and extended the offer five times when the companies
couldn't agree on the price.
   The FTC on Monday authorized its staff to seek a preliminary
injunction against the plan.
   McKesson also said on Tuesday it will abandon plans to buy
Northwestern Drug Co. of Auburn, Wash. McKesson offered about $200
million for the drug wholesaler.
   The National Association of Retail Druggists contends the
McKesson-Alco merger would give the companies 50 percent of the
drug distribution market in the United States, according to Tim
Feagans, an attorney for Alco.
   The commission said both the acquisition of Alco and
Northwestern could significantly reduce competition.

   The 12-nation Commission of European Communities
formally opened a permanent delegation to China, the organization's
external relations commissioner said Wednesday.
   The delegation, headed by Ambassador Pierre Duchateau, will
promote economic cooperation and trade between China and the EC as
well as coordinate efforts between its 12 member nations, Willy De
Clercq told a news conference.
   The commission is the central body of the European Economic
Community, which is China's top supplier of high technology and
third largest trading partner after Hong Kong and Japan. Trade
between China and the community totaled $12.44 billion in 1987, De
Clercq said.

   A new $50 million agreement between Scandinavian
Airlines System and Texas Air Corp. is designed to strengthen the
competitive positions of both companies, officials say.
   Separately, a report published today said Texas Air is holding
discussions to sell its East Coast air shuttle to developer Donald
Trump. According to unidentified sources quoted by The Wall Street
Journal, the pricetag on the three-city shuttle is in the $200
million range.
   As evidence the shuttle is up for sale, Journal sources noted
that planes and lounge areas have been refurbished, and attendants
are getting new uniforms. The service is run by Eastern Airlines.
   Texas Air declined comment on the Journal report, said Mark
Johnson, a spokesman for the airline company. Representatives of
Trump weren't immediately available for comment.
   Some say Trump might use the shuttle, which operates between
Washington, New York and Boston, to help draw people to his hotel
and casino properties in Atlantic City, N.J.
   Trump already operates a helicopter service between New York and
Atlantic City.
   Under Texas Air's agreement with SAS, the Scandinavian airline
will lease airport gates in the New York area and have the right to
buy up to 10 percent of Texas Air's stock on the open market.
   The accord, signed Tuesday, also includes provisions for
coordinating marketing, reservations and scheduling, and the
companies will establish a joint training program for airline
workers.
   Texas Air, the largest U.S. airline company, owns Continental
Airlines and Eastern Airlines, which have been hurt by financial
losses, labor problems and complaints about service.
   SAS, renowned for service but weak in scheduling connections to
the United States, has been seeking ways of positioning itself to
exploit the era of European deregulation that will begin in 1992.
   ``Our aim is to maximize efficiency and provide the best
professional service to business travelers anywhere in the world,''
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo told reporters at a New York press
briefing.
   Under the agreement, SAS will pay Continental $15 million to
lease three gates at Newark International Airport in New Jersey,
beginning next spring. SAS will pay Eastern $10 million for a
similar lease arrangement at New York's John F. Kennedy
International Airport in 1991.
   SAS also will pay Texas Air $25 million.
   SAS will have the right to buy up to 10 percent of Texas Air's
stock on the open market, and SAS officials said they intended to
make the purchases within six months.
   Texas Air stock was the most actively traded issue Tuesday on
the American Stock Exchange, declining 12{ cents to $14.25. The
company has 39.9 million shares outstanding.
   Jan Carlzon, SAS president and chief executive officer, will
become a member of Texas Air's board of directors.
   The marriage of a financially pressed U.S. airline company and a
service-oriented European carrier makes sense for both, analysts
said.
   SAS will get the access to U.S. routes that it is seeking while
Texas Air will get cash that it needs, noted Anthony Hatch, an
analyst for Argus Research Corp.
   The agreement is not unprecedented, but it combines elements of
existing arrangements in a new way. United Airlines, the biggest
U.S. carrier, signed an agreement with British Airways late last
year setting up a worldwide marketing partnership.
   But unlike the accord between SAS and Texas Air, the
United-British Airways combination doesn't include an equity stake.
SAS' equity stake in Texas Air ``helps them cement the alliance,''
Hatch said.
   As European deregulation approaches, similar accords between
major airlines in the United States and Europe are likely to crop
up, said Andrew Geller, an airline analyst for Provident National
Bank in Philadelphia.
   In another case, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd., an Australian
conglomerate owned 50-50 by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and
transportation company TNT Ltd., has a 20 percent stake in America
West Airlines, based in Tempe, Ariz. The two do not have a
cooperative agreement.
   Officials of SAS and Texas Air said they began discussions for
such an alliance about nine months ago, at Lorenzo's initiative.
SAS has similar arrangements with Thai International Airways of
Thailand, and recently purchased a stake in Argentina's national
carrier.
   Continental currently has services from Newark International
Airport to London and Paris, and from Miami to London. SAS, heavily
used by business travelers, flies between Scandinavia and four U.S.
cities: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle.
   The Scandinavian flag carrier, 50 percent owned by the
governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, has tried to develop
what its management calls a ``global axis'' strategy to provide
travelers with the most convenient connections through a network of
cooperation pacts with other carriers.

   Acid rain is more widespread than
earlier believed, with more than half of Europe's lakes and rivers
contaminated, according to a report to an international conference
which ended Wednesday.
   The report to the U.N.-sponsored Convention on Long-Range
Transboundary Air Pollution said the extent of the damage could be
much worse, since the research was mainly based on information
provided by the countries concerned.
   ``In some cases, it is too late to do anything,'' said Kaarle
Kenttamies, head of the Finnish Environment Ministry team which
conducted the survey commissioned by the Nordic Council of
Ministers.
   ``In other countries, particularly the peripheral regions such
as Scandinavia and southernmost Europe, there is still hope,''
Kenttamies said.
   ``But many small lakes and rivers, especially in central Europe,
are dead and only a 100 percent drop in sulphur emissions can save
them,'' he said. Dumping a heavy dose of lime also helps reduce
acidity, he said.
   The year-long research showed nearly all smaller bodies of water
in central Europe can no longer be used as sources of drinking
water, Kenttamies said.
   The conference, which drew participants from the United States,
the Soviet Union and nine west European nations, urged the Economic
Commission for Europe to adopt stricter measures to fight pollution
caused by nitrogen and sulphur emissions.
   ECE-member countries have decided to start a joint transboundary
pollution monitoring project in 1989 to study environmental changes
caused by acid rain.
   The research is aimed at an in-depth study and classification of
data as well as creating an integrated monitoring system on
acidification across Europe and northern America.
   ``Despite certain opposition to such research, particularly in
the United States and Great Britain, we can safely say that
acidification is one of the worst pollution problems of the
1980s,'' Kenttamies said.
   Kenttamies rejected as ``nonsense'' the argument that no
conclusive evidence exists that fossil fuel-fired power stations
are a main contributor to acid rain.
   ``Whatever people say, I've seen enough reports and been to
enough conventions like the one here today to know that we have
such conclusive evidence,'' he said.
   The high cost of fighting acid rain is a problem for countries
which rely heavily on fossil fuels. Britain and Poland, both heavy
coal users, are the only European nations which refused to join the
``Thirty Percent Club'' whose aim is to reduce 1980-level sulphur
emissions 30 percent by 1993.
   Acid rain in Scandinavia, mostly from industrial centers in
eastern and western europe, also has contaminated lakes and forests.
   Finns were recently shocked to learn of heavy pollution in what
had been considered virgin Lapland in northern Finland caused by
massive Soviet copper and nickel works from industries in the Kola
Peninsula, according to reports.
   A joint commission, currently meeting in Yalta, was set up by
the Finns and the Russians to study cross-border pollution, which
is threatening the livelihood of northern Finns dependent on
reindeer husbandry.

<HEAD>Milken Aide Compelled To Testify Before Grand Jury</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Grafs 1-6 new with comment by Dahl's attorney, picks up 6th

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aide to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
high-yield bond financier Michael Milken recently was compelled to
testify before a federal grand jury investigating the securities
firm, the aide's lawyer said Wednesday.
   James Dahl was forced to appear before the grand jury in the
last few weeks under a compulsion order obtained by the Manhattan
U.S. attorney's office, Dahl's lawyer Peter Fishbein told The
Associated Press.
   The Wall Street Journal characterized Dahl's appearance as a
breakthrough for the government in its extensive probe into the
business affairs of Milken and Drexel, who are fighting Securities
and Exchange Commission charges of securities fraud and could face
possible criminal indictments soon.
   But it was unclear from the Journal account how Dahl's
appearance represented a breakthrough. The content of his remarks
to the grand jury were not disclosed.
   ``Dahl is not a cooperating witness,'' Fishbein said. ``He was
compelled to do that by a court order. If he didn't testify he
would have been put in jail.''
   Fishbein said the order contained a provision for immunity from
prosecution, which is specified in the federal law for obtaining
such orders. The attorney declined to comment on what Dahl may have
told the grand jury.
   Officials at the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office did not
immediately return telephone calls for comment. Their policy,
however, is to refrain from commenting on grand jury matters.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the firm doesn't comment on
grand jury proceedings. But he said Drexel's lawyers had advised
the firm that grants of limited immunity were not unusual in such
investigations.
   Dahl, who is still employed by the firm, works in Drexel's West
Coast-based high-yield bond department, headed by Milken.
   The Journal said Dahl was the first Drexel official to break
ranks and cooperate with the government's inquiry since the SEC
filed its civil charges against the firm and Milken Sept. 7,
accusing them of insider trading, stock manipulation, defrauding
clients and other violations.
   Those charges, denied by the defendants, stem largely from
claims by now-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who turned
state's evidence after paying a record $100 million fine to the
government two years ago for insider trading. Federal investigators
have been working to substantiate Boesky's assertions with other
evidence but there are indications they have been frustrated in
obtaining supporting testimony from others.
   Lawyers for Drexel and Milken, meantime, have been fighting
aggressively to obtain whatever evidence the government has to
prepare their defense. They also have challenged the objectivity of
the federal judge assigned to the case, Milton Pollack, on grounds
his wife has an interest in a Drexel-financed deal.
   In a related matter, another federal judge ruled the government
has the right to freeze funds of innocent partners in an unindicted
investment partnership, when other partners are accused in a
racketeering case.
   The Tuesday decision by U.S. District Judge Robert Carter is
significant because the case involving Princeton-Newport partners,
a small partnership based in Princeton, N.J., represents the first
time the government has brought racketeering charges against
securities professionals.
   Carter's ruling apparently gives the government broad authority
to tie up a firm's legitimate businesses, even when it isn't
accused of a crime. The implication is enormous for Drexel if any
of its employees are similarly accused of racketeering by a grand
jury.

<HEAD>Choices Proliferate in CDs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that such former best sellers as stocks and
mutual funds have fallen out of favor, financial institutions are
busy these days pushing a hot new idea _ certificates of deposit.
   Not just plain vanilla CDs, mind you, though you can certainly
still get those stodgy old-timers if you want them.
   What we're dealing with now are rising-rate CDs, floating-rate
CDs, CDs with no set maturity dates, even CDs that effectively let
you make a legal bet on your favorite sports team or the outcome of
the November election.
   All this hasn't happened just by chance. The stock market crash
last fall and the wide swings in interest rates over the past
several years have brought big changes in the marketplace where
brokers and bankers sell their merchandise.
   ``I choose to think of it as a rebirth of investor prudence,''
says William Brennan, a Valley Forge, Pa., adviser on tax and
investment planning.''
   ``Today's low tax rates and market turmoil have reinstated
preservation of principal as a justifiable objective for personal
planning.''
   In this environment, CDs are a natural choice for financial
marketers to seize upon. Thanks to today's high level of real
interest rates (as compared with the inflation rate), they can
offer a reasonable return, with the backing of federal deposit
insurance.
   And thanks to financial deregulation, the once-rigid format of a
certificate of deposit has become very flexible.
   In general, financial advisers say, that is a plus for savers
and investors. But they caution that it takes a lot of care to
distinguish the substance from the sizzle in the new generation of
CDs.
   There is no real harm, for instance, in buying a CD whose yield
will vary depending on the outcome of the Super Bowl or the
election, as long as you have enough financial leeway to play that
kind of game with your money.
   A little no-nonsense calculation may cool your enthusiasm for
such a deal, which don't really offer much of a payout or loss.
   With one ``presidential'' CD now on the market, the newsletter
100 Highest Yield calculates, if the candidate of your choice wins
with 59 percent of the popular vote (the amount President Reagan
got in his 1984 landslide), you would receive an extra $10.13 over
the next four years on a $1,000 deposit.
   If you opt to shop purely for yield and safety, the choices are
still bewilderingly large.
   Newsletters like 100 Highest Yields, in North Palm Beach, Fla.,
and Income & Safety, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., compile lists of
top-yielding CD offerings by banks and savings institutions around
the country.
   Even with federal deposit insurance, it makes sense these days
to check out the status and prospects of some faraway institution
before you mail off a large deposit check.
   Alternatively, you can do your CD shopping at brokerage firms,
which may have certificates from a wide variety of insured
institutions to offer.
   ``Brokerage houses not only seek out the highest-paying
institutions to provide CDs for their customers, but they also
frequently negotiate special package deals that lead to higher
rates than the same banks offer directly to the public,'' says the
Income & Safety newsletter.
   It may be possible to liquidate a CD investment bought from a
broker before maturity without paying a penalty, since most brokers
endeavor to maintain a continuous ``secondary'' market in the CDs
they sell.
   You probably won't have to pay a commission when you buy or
sell. But if you are thinking of selling before maturity, check
into the ``spread'' _ the difference between the broker's bid and
asked prices.
   Just possibly, the spread might be as large as or larger than
the early withdrawal penalty.

<HEAD>SmithKline Sweetens Severance Package For Workers Facing Layoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers who promise not to sue SmithKline
Beckman Corp. over their layoffs will receive a sweetened severance
package, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday.
   In a three-page letter last week to about 3,000 workers in the
Philadelphia area, SmithKline said those who sign a waiver will
receive more severance pay, career counseling and extended health
benefits.
   Henry Wendt, chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
letter a ``similar package for voluntary resignation in designated
areas will be announced later this year.''
   Workers who don't sign the waiver will be eligible for the
standard severance package, and some longtime workers will be
eligible for an enhanced pension whether they sign a waiver or not.
   SmithKline announced last week it would eliminate 1,600 jobs,
mostly in Philadelphia, as part of a $400 million restructuring
that will include the public sale of 17 percent of its Beckman
Instruments division.
   Bernard Shaeffer, vice president for research for Hay-Huggins
Co. Inc., a Philadelphia benefits-consulting firm, said companies
commonly ask employees to sign a waiver in return for enhanced
separation benefits.
   The company said employees who earn a weekly paycheck _
including most production workers and secretaries _ would receive
two to three times as much as they would under the standard plan,
if they sign the waiver.
   For example, a 17-year employee earning a weekly paycheck would
normally get 18 weeks of severance pay. Under the enhanced plan,
that worker would receive nearly 56 weeks of pay.
   Workers paid twice a month _ including managers and supervisors
_ would get 25 percent more than the normal severance.
   For example, a 10-year veteran's severance pay would last six
months and a week instead of the standard five months.
   The career counseling will be available to all who sign the
waiver. Normally such transition assistance is only offered to
upper-level employees, a company spokesman said.
   SmithKline will continue to pay its share of health benefits for
six months after termination instead of three months.
   A company spokesman said employees would be encouraged to review
the severance package for at least 10 days before deciding whether
to sign the waiver.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators estimated today it will
cost between $45 billion and $50 billion to clean up the ailing
savings and loan industry, increasing earlier projections by more
than a third.
   M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which regulates the nation's 3,000 S&Ls, told Congress this summer
the cost would be $31 billion.
   Today he revised his figure upward to bring it more in line with
other government estimates, including the $45 billion to $50
billion projection of Congress' General Accounting Office. But the
figure is still far short of private estimates ranging from $75
billion to $100 billion.
   Noting that the bank board has resolved 122 cases so far this
year at a cost of $20 billion, Wall said it would cost an
additional $24.9 billion to $29.9 billion for the work that remains
to be done.
   Wall said that cost could be covered by the current resources of
his agency, but only if a special assessment on healthy thrift
institutions is extended over the next 30 years.
   S&Ls currently pay 21 cents a year in regular and special
assessments to the bank board to insure every $100 in deposits,
nearly double the 8 cent per $100 regular assessment paid by
commercial banks.
   The special assessment for thrifts had been scheduled to be
phased out. When Wall suggested earlier this summer that the
assessment would have to continue over 10 years, he unleashed a
flood of protests from industry lobby groups.
   The bank board's new estimate comes at a time of rising debate
over whether taxpayers will be required to rescue the thrift
industry. Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire,
D-Wis., said last month that taxpayers likely will have to
contribute $20 billion to fixing the problem.
   However, Wall, who spoke with reporters in advance of testimony
scheduled today before the Senate Budget Committee, said some
institutions would not survive under a continuing special
assessment. But he added: ``I don't think we're to a taxpayer
bailout yet.''
   The updated estimate reflects industry losses during the
April-June period of this year, and the bank board's cost of
resolving cases through September, which have been greater than
originally anticipated, Wall said.
   Money-losing institutions posted red ink of $5.1 billion in the
second quarter. That was only partly offset by $1.5 billion in
profits made by 71 percent of the industry.
   Wall said it is difficult to calculate the effect of the higher
costs of the federal budget deficit because only certain kinds of
government assistance count toward the deficit.
   However, Bruce Steinberg, an analyst with Merrill Lynch,
estimates that the budget deficit will be inflated by nearly $15
billion a year over the next three years under a cost estimate of
$50 billion.
   Meanwhile, the House Banking Committee today is considering
legislation sponsored by Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., to expand
the bank board's authority to borrow money by selling bonds from
the $10.8 billion authorized last summer to $15 billion.
   Wall said he opposes the legislation because it places emphasis
on the bond sales, which are not obligations of the federal
government and are thus more expensive than the bank board's
preferred method of issuing promissory notes to shore up troubled
institutions.

<TEXT>
   All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest airline,
said Wednesday it will buy six Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets at a total
cost of $720 million.
   ANA spokesman Takayuki Shimada said the company will sign the
contract soon with Boeing Co., the giant U.S. aircraft manufacturer.
   He said ANA chose the 370-seat aircraft, which uses a two-man
cockpit crew, because it is fuel efficient and can fly farther than
current models.
   Shimada said the planes would be used on the Tokyo-Washington
and Tokyo-London routes.
   The first of the six aicraft will be delivered in May 1990,
Shimada said.
   Japan Air Lines, the nation's largest airline, has ordered 20 of
the 747-400 aircraft from the Seattle-based company.
   ANA, which flies mostly domestic routes, has 75 Boeing aircraft,
11 Lockheed Tristar jetliners and 16 Japanese-made YS-11 airplanes.

<HEAD>Measuring The Quality of Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asked in a survey to name five companies they
associate with quality products, 1,005 Americans most often named
General Electric, General Motors, Ford, IBM and Sears.
   Nothing really surprising in that, or in the second five _ AT&T,
Sony, Chrysler, RCA (a GE subsidiary) and Procter & Gamble _
because they wouldn't be so big unless they were doing something
right.
   What is surprising is that the characteristic most often cited
in determining product quality is how well the name is known,
outranking such considerations as workmanship, price, performance,
durability and style.
   The response to a Gallup survey for the American Society for
Quality Control suggests how difficult it is to evaluate the mind
of the American consumer in dealing with manufactured products.
   But if it is difficult to measure attitudes toward the most
tangible of products, it is even more so in dealing with services,
which are produced in even greater abundance in the American
economy.
   How, for example, do you measure the quality of an insurance
policy when you do not even understand its contents? You know when
an automobile runs well; you might never know how well your policy
performs until you have an accident.
   Cost comparisons are more difficult too. Some life insurance
policies actually provide better coverage and higher cash value at
a lower price than others. But only geniuses or actuaries are
likely to know the difference.
   As a result, the perception of service quality is more likely to
be on the basis of interaction with specific individuals, such as
insurance agents.
   Price for example, ranked sixth as a service quality determinant
in the Gallup poll, behind ``courteous, polite treatment,'' the
satisfaction of needs, past experience, recommendations and
promptness.
   High on the list were such determinants as attitude and
helpfulness of personnel, friendliness and personal atttention. Far
down the list was ``company name,'' a factor that seemed to play a
large role in rating product quality.
   Unlike the product quality survey, Gallup didn't rate individual
companies in a survey on service. Instead, it limited responses to
perceptions of quality in segments of the service industry, with
these results:
   On a scale of 1 to 10, or worst to highest, banks received the
highest evaluation, with a 54 percent majority ranking their
service at 8 or better. It was the only one to exceed 50 percent.
   Ranked second were hotels, at 44 percent, followed by hospitals,
airlines and insurance companies (a tie), automobile repairs and
local government. Compared with a similar survey in 1985, banks,
hotels, auto repairs and local government services improved.
Insurance companies, hospitals and airlines fell.
   Featured on the down list were airlines, which provoked the
observation from the Gallup folks that ``since 1985, the one
service which experienced the greatest decrease in high quality
ratings is the airlines.''
   For the airlines it was the equivalent of a downdraft. In the
1985 survey, 47 percent of those interviewed perceived airline
quality as rating no lower than an 8 on the 10-level scale. In
1988, only 32 percent rated airlines that high.

<HEAD>Kuwaitis Call for Dropping Britain as Investment Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDUL-JALIL MUSTAFA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government kept silent Wednesday about
Britain's move to slash Kuwait's stake in British Petroleum Co.
PLC, but many business people said Kuwait should consider ending
all investment in Britain.
   Britain ordered the Kuwait Investment Office on Tuesday to
reduce its 21.68 percent stake in British Petroleum to 9.9 percent
within a year, saying the holding threatened the interests of the
Britian public.
   British financial analysts said the investment office, which is
owned by the Kuwaiti government, could lose hundreds of millions of
dollars.
   The Kuwaiti government, which said Tuesday that it was
``extremely dissatisfied'' with the ruling, withheld further
comment as officials considered the implications of the order.
   But the thrust of opinion in economic circles was that Britain
should be dropped as investment market.
   Oil-rich Kuwait has an estimated $85 billion invested abroad,
mainly in the United States, Britain, France, West Germany and
other Western European countries.
   Recent investments have been made in Asia, including China,
through the Kuwait Investment Office, which is based in London.
   The state-run radio and television network ignored the British
decision in news broadcasts, although pro-government newspapers
published the report on their inside economic pages.
   The state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp., which owns the stake in
British Petroleum, declined comment. So did the office of Kuwait's
oil minister, Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah.
   In London, Michael Walter, a lawyer with the law firm Stephenson
Harwood, which is representing the Kuwait Investment Office, said:
``We haven't decided what we are going to do, nor have we ruled out
any possible course of action.''
   ``One of the things I am looking at is whether the commission's
finding is open to (a court) challenge,'' he said.
   The Kuwait Investment Office announced last Nov. 18 that it had
purchased 10 percent of British Petroleum's shares. The holding was
gradually increased to 21.68 percent after the British government
put its remaining one-third stake in the oil company up for sale on
the stock market.
   The British Mergers and Monpolies Commission said Tuesday that
Kuwait's holding in British Petroleum ``may be expected to operate
against the public interest'' and recommended it be cut.
   Lord Young, Britain's trade secretary, accepted the findings and
told the Kuwait Investment Office to reduce the British Petroleum
stake.
   Leading Kuwaiti economists and investment decision-makers
strongly criticized the British move, labeling it ``unjustifiable''
and ``a mistake.''
   ``It's the worst reaction on the part of a country that promotes
a free market economy and deals a blow to this ideology, especially
as the decision is taken when a Conservative government, which
supports the policy of privatization and capitalization, is in
office,'' said Jassim al-Saadoun, chairman of the Shell Economic
Consultancy Bureau.
   ``It's an unjust decision and impairs economic freedom,'' he
said.
   Al-Saadoun predicted Kuwait would respond by reducing its
investment in Britain or by asking the British government to buy
part of Kuwait's holding or extend the 12-month deadline.
   Ziad Taqi, head of the economic department at the National Bank
of Kuwait said, ``It's a bad and annoying decision which has an
adverse impact on the local market.''
   If Britain wanted to remain a free market economy that attracts
both private and government institutions ``it should not have dealt
such a blow to Kuwait,'' he said.
   Taqi said the British government should have stepped in earlier
to express its opposition since Kuwait gradually built up the
British Petroleum stake.
   ``I think the British decision will prompt the (Kuwaiti)
government to reconsider its investment in Britain,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boom In Luxury Hotels Could Turn Into A Glut For Chicago</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES J. GANS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four luxury hotels have opened in downtown
Chicago in the last year and three more are set to open over the
next 18 months, but some industry officials fear a glut of
high-priced rooms could turn the city's hotel boom into a bust.
   Since last October, the Nikko, the Fairmont, the Swiss Grand and
the Hotel 21 East have opened their doors, adding 2,000 more rooms.
Three more hotels _ the Four Seasons, the Intercontinental and the
Hyatt Suites _ are set to open by March 1990, with 1,000 more rooms.
   All are priced at the upper end of the market, with room rates
starting at $160 a night.
   ``Obviously, it's going to have a serious impact on the hotel
industry in the Chicagoland area,'' said Arnold Karr, executive
director of the Hotel@Motel Association of Illinois, which
represents 260 hotels throughout the state.
   ``The market is not capable of absorbing all the new rooms,'' he
said. ``That doesn't mean the new hotels won't succeed, but there
may be a shakeout among the other hotels.''
   Karr said there was little new hotel construction in the city
between 1981 and 1987, but the expansion of the McCormick Place
convention center in 1986 helped spur the current boom.
   He said the city's hotel industry would be able to handle a
normal 4 to 5 percent yearly increase in the number of rooms, but
the recent boom has suddenly caused a 16 percent increase, from
about 18,000 before 1987 to 21,000 at present.
   Occupancy rates were about 70 percent last year, and could drop
by 2 percent this year due to the hotel expansion, Karr said. He
estimated that it would take three to four years for the market to
absorb the new rooms.
   He said the new hotels should have ``some staying power''
because they are part of major chains with strong financial backing
and extensive reservations and marketing systems.
   But he said the glut could hit older downtown hotels as well as
suburban hotels, which previously could count on spillover bookings
when the downtown hotels were fully booked.
   Jerry Roper, president of the Chicago Convention and Visitors'
Bureau, conceded that some older or suburban hotels could suffer
some fallout, but denied there was any glut.
   ``I don't see it as a glut,'' he said. ``I see it as an
opportunity for economic development in the city, for providing new
jobs, because we do have the demand.''
   The new hotel rooms would make it easier for Chicago to attract
new business, said Mark Albian, the convention bureau's market
research manager.
   ``Unlike New York, Chicago has a lot of potential left for
tourism and corporate business,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, around Chicago hotel managers are gearing up for the
increased competition.
   Don DePorter, regional vice president for the Hyatt Corporation,
said it is normal for a new hotel to lose money for the first two
to five years as it tries to find its market niche.
   But he said, ``I don't think it's going to be a bust ... because
the city has been starving for rooms,'' he said. ``It's only a glut
if we don't do anything about it.''
   DePorter said Hyatt would try to book more small group business
into its suburban hotels to make up for the expected lost bookings.
   At the Swiss Grand Hotel, which opened in August, general
manager Costas Vafopoulos, said its links to Swissair should help
generate business and the hotel would offer ``European-style
service'' catering to international travelers.
   ``We see great prospects and opportunities in the downtown
Chicago area,'' he said. ``We feel the competition is healthy.''
   Victor T. Burt, general manager of the 67-year-old Drake, one of
Chicago's oldest luxury hotels, said he expects the recently
refurbished hotel ``will hold its own'' because it has a loyal
clientele.
   ``I think next year is a big question mark,'' he said. ``No one
really has the answer to whether Chicago can support all these new
hotels.''

<HEAD>Union Carbide Sues Seven Japanese Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp.'s legal charges that
seven Japanese companies manipulated the price of a raw material
for computer chips are ``utterly baseless,'' one of the defendants
claims.
   Union Carbide sued Monday in U.S. District Court, asking for a
jury trial and an order prohibiting the seven from fixing prices
and controlling the export to Japan of polysilicon, the raw
material for silicon wafers.
   The lawsuit seeks damages for the losses Union Carbide suffered
as a result of the alleged conspiracy.
   The defendants are Komatsu Electronic Metals Co.; its parent
firm, Komatsu Ltd.; Mitsubishi Metal Co. Ltd.; Mitsubishi
subsidiary Nippon Silicon Co. Ltd.; Osaka Titanium Co. Ltd.;
Shinetsu Handotai Co. Ltd.; and Tokuyama Soda Co. Ltd.
   Komatsu Electronic Metals Co., together with its parent, Komatsu
Ltd., issued a joint statement calling the charges baseless.
   ``Although Union Carbide calls it an antitrust suit, its
complaint is really part of an ongoing contract dispute with KEM,
arising out of UCC's unfounded interpretation of its contract with
KEM,'' it said.
   The statements said Union Carbide is trying to recoup
``self-inflicted losses resulting from its own flawed business
decisions at the expense of a Japanese company that has adhered
fully to the letter and the spirit of its contractual obligations.''
   The suit by Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide claimed Komatsu
Electronic and other companies that purchased the material and
produced silicon wafers formed a ``polysilicon buyers' cartel'' in
1983.
   According to the lawsuit, the Japanese companies arranged to
``deplete inventories, to refrain from bidding against one another
for fixed supplies in order to minimize open market price increases
and otherwise set purchase prices.''
   Union Carbide said several U.S. polysilicon manufacturers have
been forced to exit the merchant market because of the defendants'
action.
   The defendants and other Japanese companies banded together and
pose as a silicon-wafer industry study group. However, they
secretly exchanged information about business costs, pricing,
supply and demand and strategic plans to the detriment of
non-Japanese companies, the suit said.

   The European Economic Community
Commission Wednesday proposed EEC-wide patent legislation to
protect biotechnology inventions in the 12-nation trade bloc.
   National patent laws differ so much from one EEC nation to the
next that ``lack of legal certainty and lack of sufficient
protection is commonplace in the Community in this field,'' the
commission said.
   EEC scientists are at a disadvantage compared to their
colleagues in the United States and Japan, whose laws offer
``considerably more protection through patentability that is
currently available in Europe,'' the commission said.
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has already granted a
patent on a man-made mouse from Harvard University. Japan is
expected to grant similar patents shortly.

<HEAD>Some Farmers Get Drought Insurance Checks; Others Battle Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois farmers who received
controversial drought insurance coverage have begun to receive
payments, but for those involuntarily left without policies, the
legal fight continues, officials said Wednesday.
   Richard Carlson, assistant director of the state Insurance
Department, said the Chubb Group has mailed checks for more than $5
million to Illinois farmers who received the insurance coverage.
   Chubb, a New Jersey-based insurance group, has estimated that
1,058 Illinois farmers applied for coverage but only 263 of them
received drought insurance policies. Another 715 farmers accepted
the company's double-premium refund offer.
   Agents in the drought-stricken Cornbelt advertised the insurance
and accepted premium payments late this spring _ when many farmers
already suspected it would be a very dry growing season.
   When underwriters realized that 10 times the $30 million
intended issue had been sold, they raised the issue to $40 million
and issued policies only if applications were made by June 15.
   Those who received insurance coverage were guaranteed payments
if the rainfall in their counties from June through August was
below certain levels.
   Carlson said most payments to Illinois farmers are in the
$8,000-20,000 range. However, he said two farmers at Sheldon in
Iroquois County received $128,000 and $177,000 respectively.
   Carlson said Chubb so far has made drought insurance payments to
five farmers in Ford County, 29 in Iroquois County, 32 in Kankakee
County, 54 in Livingston County and one each in Champaign and
McLean counties.
   But many other farmers still hope to receive the drought
insurance they thought they purchased _ and the payments that would
boost their income significantly.
   One farm family told the Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette that they
paid an $18,000 premium but did not receive a policy. Instead, they
said Chubb refunded twice that amount as a ``goodwill'' gesture.
   However, the family said what they want is the insurance and the
payment they would be due under the coverage _ more than $160,000.
   Farmers who paid premiums all over the country are party to a
class-action suit in federal court in Cincinnati that seeks to
force Chubb to extend the coverage to anyone who paid a premium and
still wants the insurance.
   The state Insurance Department is trying to determine how many
Illinois farmers paid premiums and did not receive policies, so it
can calculate how much Chubb would owe to farmers in the state.
   Carlson said his department then is likely to file charges
against Chubb, focusing on the fact that the company did not clear
the policy with state officials before offering it for sale.
   ``Our bottom-line interest is protecting state farmers and
forcing the company to satisfy our farmers,'' said Carlson.

   Share prices ended higher Wednesday, as players
scurried to cover short positions in a rising market.
   Dealers also said players were encouraged by the market's
resilience Tuesday in the face of bearish news.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 19
points, or 1 percent, higher at 1,826.3, slightly off its
mid-afternoon best level of 1,827.9. The index opened unchanged at
1,807.3, its weakest level for the day.
   By recent standards, volume was relatively healthy, as 570.8
million shares changed hands, compared with the 442.3 million
shares traded Tuesday.
   Traders said they also were encouraged by Wall Street's ability
to rally from a 12-point deficit reached in early New York trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 2.67 points at 2,104.73 as
the London session came to a close.
   Few stocks bucked the upward trend, dealers said. Of the
100-share index stocks, only 10 closed lower, and five were
unchanged.
   The buoyant market was created by players with short positions,
or agreements to sell shares, who had to catch up with the rising
market, dealers said.
   One salesman said shares went higher in the absence of selling
pressure. In addition, players now feel more confident about
entering the market after its rally late Tuesday in the face of
news of a share sale by Grand Metropolitan PLC to help finance its
bid for Pillsbury Co. and the government-ordered reduction of
Kuwait Investment Office's stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC.

<HEAD>Magazine: Americans Expect Economic Problems, But Not at Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two-thirds of Americans surveyed want
to see the rich pay more taxes, while an increasing number of
people are growing disenchanted with the new tax law, according to
a poll released Wednesday.
   The sixth annual Money magazine survey on Americans and their
money also found many respondents expect the economy to run into
problems in the coming months. But those surveyed don't expect to
see their own financial situations worsen.
   The findings of the survey, conducted by Lieberman Research
Inc., were based on questionnaires completed by 2,370 adults
nationwide. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3
percentage points.
   The survey, conducted last spring, was the first taken after
taxpayers had their initial encounter with filing returns under the
new tax law.
   Thirty-five percent of the respondents said the new law was less
fair than the old statute, while 17 percent said it was more fair,
15 percent said it was as fair, and 33 percent said they did not
know.
   In contrast, in a poll taken in October 1986, 22 percent of the
respondents said the new law was less fair, while 30 percent said
it was more fair, 11 percent said it was as fair and 37 percent did
not know.
   Asked whether they thought they would pay more or less taxes
under the new law, 37 percent said they thought they would pay more
taxes, 14 expected to pay less and 26 percent said they thought
their taxes would remain the same. Twenty-three percent said they
did not know.
   The survey indicated that most Americans want to see the wealthy
taxed more heavily.
   Sixty-nine percent of the respondents said they would be more
likely to vote in this election year for a candidate who supported
higher taxes for people earning more than $100,000 a year. Nine
percent said they would be less likely to vote for such a
candidate, while 22 percent said this campaign stance would not
affect their vote.
   Respondents were generally not sure over whether they thought
they would be better off financially under a Republican or
Democratic administration.
   Nearly half of those surveyed _ 46 percent _ had no opinion on
the matter. Twenty-eight percent said they would be better off
under a Democratic administration, while 26 percent said they would
be better off under the GOP.
   A majority of respondents expected the economy to run into
obstacles such as double-digit inflation, unemployment and a
serious recession.
   Fifty-three percent of those surveyed said they expected the
United States to have serious economic problems during the next
year, while 47 percent said they do not expect the economy to have
serious troubles.
   But most of the respondents did not expect economic problems to
worsen their own financial situations. Forty-seven percent expected
their financial situations to be better in one year's time.
Forty-three percent said they expected their financial situations
to be the same, while 10 percent expected their situations to get
worse.
   Asked how comfortable their standard of living was, 59 percent
of respondents said their standard of living was comfortable, while
41 percent said their standard of living was not comfortable. That
breakdown was unchanged from the 1987 and 1985 surveys, and little
different from the 1986 poll.
   Respondents' view of their standard of living increased along
with their income levels. For example, 83 percent of respondents in
upper income households said their standard of living was
comfortable, compared with 27 percent of those in lower-income
households.
   Upper-income households were defined as those with annual
incomes over $50,000, while lower-income households earned under
$15,000 a year.
   The survey was taken more than six months after the October 1987
stock market crash.
   As a result of the crash, 28 percent of the total respondents
and 48 percent of the stockholders said they had made changes in
the way they handle their finances, such as making more
conservative investments or saving more.
   Seventy-two percent of the total sample and 52 percent of the
stockholders said they had made no changes.

   The stock market showed some scattered gains
today as traders bided their time awaiting the latest government
statistics on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 0.18 to 2,102.24 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 747 up, 581 down and
513 unchanged.
   Analysts said nothing had taken place to stir the market out of
its recent lethargy.
   Traders have been leery of making big commitments for several
days now, awaiting Friday's report from the Labor Department on the
employment situation for September.
   Many analysts are projecting that the figures will show strong
job growth, which would presumably revive concerns at the Federal
Reserve and elsewhere about inflation.
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber tumbled 4 to 53\. The company estimated
sharply lower third-quarter earnings from continuing operations.
   Kroger rose 3\ to 58{ in active trading. The investment firm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. sweetened its buyout bid for the

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.37 to 153.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .57 at 299.05.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 131.86 million shares with two

<HEAD>Partner Buys Royal Admiral to Stave Off Carnival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bid to merge two of the nation's largest cruise
lines was thwarted Wednesday when a Norwegian partner in Royal
Admiral Cruises Ltd. bought 70 percent of the company's stock for
$561 million, heading off a similar offer by Carnival Cruise Lines
Inc.
   The surprise announcement was made in Oslo, Norway, by Royal
Admiral minority stockholder Arne Wilhelmsen. He divulged that his
company, the Anders Wilhelmsen & Co. group, has exercised its right
of first refusal to purchase the balance of Royal Admiral's shares.
   ``This transaction will give Royal Admiral the flexibility and
opportunity to boldly move ahead with Royal Admiral's expansion
plans,'' Wilhelmsen said.
   He also announced his company is negotiating the formation of a
joint venture with an entity related to the Pritzker family, the
owner of the Hyatt and Hyatt International chain of 144 hotels.
   Royal Admiral's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard D.
Fain said that under the proposed deal with the Pritzkers,
Wilhelmsen would turn around and sell them 50 percent of the cruise
company's stock.
   ``I think we're pleased that the situation has been clarified
and the uncertainty has been eliminated,'' Fain said. .
   Wilhelmsen's decision to exercise his right of first refusal
ended Carnival's identical $561 million offer for the 70 percent of
Royal Admiral's stock not already owned by Wilhelmsen. The two
cruise lines are based in Miami.
   Carnival President Micky Arison was cautious about the
announcement, saying only that ``we understand Wilhelmsen now has
30 days in which to close the transaction.''
   Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher said the company would have no
further comment until it had studied the deal.
   Royal Admiral is the holding company for both Royal Caribbean
Cruise Lines and Admiral Cruises.
   Royal Admiral has eight large cruise ships, including the
world's largest, the 2,300-passenger Sovereign of the Seas, and is
building a new 1,600-passenger vessel in France. Carnival has about
the same number of ships, RCCL spokesman Rich Steck said.
   ``Pretty soon we're going to be announcing that we are building
one or two sister ships for Sovereign Of The Seas,'' Steck added.
   Wilhelmsen beat a deadline of October 10 to exercise his option
and in the past month has arranged for financing for the purchase
through Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse and Bank of Nova Scotia.
   Wilhelmsen was one of the three original partners in RCCL when
it was founded in 1970. Earlier this year he and another partner
formed Royal Admiral by joining it with Admiral Cruises, Steck said.

   Some food prices climbed above levels
explainable by the summer drought but no widespread price gouging
of grocery shoppers has been found thus far, congressional
investigators said Wednesday.
   ``Some price increases do appear higher than warranted by the
drought alone,'' Senate Agriculture Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,
D-Vt., said after receiving the report from the General Accounting
Office.
   After weighing the congressional investigative agency's
findings, however, he told a hearing of the committee that ``in
general, there do not seem to have been excessive price increases
across a broad range of products that use the drought as an
excuse.''
   Retail pasta prices increased 10.4 percent, cereal 7.1 percent
and white bread 8.2 percent from January through June, GAO
officials told the Agriculture Committee. They said 43 percent of
the pasta and cereal price rise and 57 percent of that for white
bread came before June.
   Pasta, cereal and white bread prices rose more between June and
August than they did in the same period last year, the GAO said.
   The fierce summer heat and shortage of rainfall, which surfaced
as an urgent problem in June, wrought some of its worst damage in
the northern Grain Belt where durum wheat used to manufacture pasta
is produced.
   Farm prices for durum as well as hard red spring wheat, a
primary ingredient in white bread, did increase this year in
contrast to 1987 but alone would not have explained the rise at the
retail level.
   As drought scorched feed and pasture lands, livestock producers
increasingly sold cattle for slaughter, creating a buyers market
and driving down prices. The decrease, however, was not reflected
in any savings for consumers at the supermarket, the investigators
said.
   Just why some prices rose beyond levels explainable as a
byproduct of the drought remains something of a mystery, GAO
officials said.
   It may have been because ``prices of packaging of food products
went up significantly this year,'' Mary Kenney of the GAO told the
committee.
   ``There could have been some labor cost increases ... we don't
know if there were,'' said John W. Harman, associate director of
the GAO's resources, community and economic development division.
   Senators said it would be unjust to put the blame for
unwarranted price increases on farmers, who receive only a minor
portion of the price that consumers pay for food.
   The price of farm commodities accounted for 30 percent of the
price of all food products last year. The bulk of the price tag
reflects transportation, processing, packaging, advertising and
other marketing expenses.
   After hearing the data, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said that
``conclusive evidence of price gouging has not been found but there
are some indications out there'' that the problem could develop
next year.
   The Agriculture Department has been trying to calm concerns
about unwarranted price increases. It estimates that the drought
will tack 1 percent onto the consumer price index for food this
year and perhaps 2 percent next year. Prices would be affected next
year because the drought has reduced stockpiled surpluses of some
crops, which drives up their prices.
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said he did not rule out that price
increases prior to June were related to the drought. He said he had
been expecting ``a hot dry summer'' and that the food industry,
``with its excellent sources of intelligence,'' might have done the
same.
   Steven D. Maurer, director of the Ohio Department of
Agriculture, appealed to the committee not to condemn farmers for
any increases.
   ``The farmer's share of the food market dollar has remained
relatively constant,'' he said.
   Food wholesaler-retailer Richard F. Bondareff, president of
Bonfeld Inc., said that his Virginia-based food stores have fought
to hold the line on prices, and in some cases kept them level
despite increases charged by suppliers for fear that higher price
tags would give competitors an edge.
   ``We try to do the right thing because of the competitive nature
of the business,'' he told the committee.

   Corn and soybean futures prices edged downward
while wheat prices advanced Wednesday at the Chicago Board of Trade
in a sluggish market under the influence of good harvesting
conditions and limited demand.
   Profit-taking among corn and soybean traders after Tuesday's
rallies pressured prices, held down by an outlook for favorable
harvesting weather for the next several days in the Corn Belt.
   An anticipated overnight frost in southern Missouri and other
key soybean-growing regions that would have threatened crops failed
to materialize and helped keep the lid on buying enthusiasm in the
bean pit, said Cathy Leow, assistant vice president at Thompson
McKinnon Securities, Inc. in New York.
   Wheat gained support from continued expectations that signing of
the U.S.-Soviet grain pact is near, she said.
   ``Anticipation is that once the U.S.-Russian agreement is
signed, the Soviets are likely to be given credit, and once they
get their credit, they'll be in the market to buy,'' Ms. Leow said.
   But, she said, activity in the grain and soybean pits remained
slow.
   ``When you've got good harvesting conditions and limited demand,
the market's going to be pretty sluggish,'' she said.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.26 a bushel; corn was {
cent to 2\ cents lower with December at $2.93\ a bushel; oats were
1 cent to 2{ cents lower, with December at $2.46} a bushel; and
soybeans were 3{ cents to 8{ cents lower, with November at $8.24 a
bushel.

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range today
as traders bided their time awaiting the latest government
statistics on the employment situation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.66 to 2,099.40
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 713 up, 628 down and

   Analysts said nothing had taken place to stir the market out of
its recent lethargy.
   Traders have been leery of making big commitments for several
days now, awaiting Friday's report from the Labor Department on the
employment situation for September.
   Many analysts are projecting that the figures will show strong
job growth, which would presumably revive concerns at the Federal
Reserve and elsewhere about inflation.
   Goodyear Tire & Rubber tumbled 4 to 53\. The company estimated
sharply lower third-quarter earnings from continuing operations.
   Kroger rose 3[ to 58] in active trading. The investment firm of
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. sweetened its buyout bid for the
company.
   Pillsbury, target of a $60-a-share takeover bid by Grand
Metropolitan PLC, led the active list and gained ~ to 57~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.27 to 153.20. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   About 3,500 members of the United Auto
Workers union walked off their jobs Wednesday at a Chrysler Corp.
assembly plant when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline.
   ``We worked through the night trying to resolve the issues but
were unable to reach an agreement,'' Chrysler spokesman Lloyd
Northard said in Highland Park, Mich., following the 10 a.m. CDT
walkout. ``Our labor relations people are still there trying to
reach an agreement.''
   Northard declined to specify the issues keeping the two sides
apart. A national agreement between Chrysler and the UAW was
reached in May.
   Chrysler's working agreements with 138 UAW locals expired at
midnight Sept. 14, but had been extended on day-to-day bases,
Northard said. Although many local agreements have been reached,
UAW Local 110 in Fenton notified the company last week it was
imposing Wednesday's deadline.
   A strike authorization vote was taken several months ago by
Local 110. Its members gave 88 percent approval last week to
extending the strike deadline beyond a Sept. 30 date that had been
set.
   Local president George Burr said negotiations were ongoing.
   ``We're prepared to go around the clock,'' Burr said. ``I'm not
going to break (them) off if we're getting somewhere.''
   Long-wheelbase minivans are assembled at the plant, where a
five-week walkout to protest stalled contract talks was staged by
UAW Local 110 members in 1985.

<HEAD>SAS Employees Denounce Texas Air Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees of Scandinavian Airlines
System in Denmark reacted angrily when they heard that SAS had
signed a cooperation deal with Houston-based Texas Air Corp.,
newspaper reports said Wednesday.
   ``Texas Air Corp. is owned and managed by Francisco Lorenzo, who
is notorious in the aviation world. The entire existence of the
company is based on a poor product and unethical and often illegal
treatment of the employees,'' SAS' unions said in a statement.
   The labor groups branded Texas Air Chairman Lorenzo a ``union
buster'' and a strongly anti-union employer, the Copenhagen
newspaper Berlingske Tidende said.
   In the deal announced in New York Tuesday, SAS will get leases
on airport gates in the New York area and the right to buy up to 10
percent of Texas Air's stock on the open market.
   SAS will pay Texas Air $50 million under the accord, which also
includes provisions for coordinating marketing, reservations and
scheduling as well as training of airline personnel.
   ``Of all partners, (SAS President Jan) Carlzon has chosen the
worst possible,'' flight attendants union Chairman Per Espersen was
quoted as saying in the tabloid Ekstra Bladet.
   Lorenzo is a ``bandit whose contempt for humanity in this world
was exceeded only by (former Ugandan dictator) Idi Amin,'' Espersen
was quoted as saying.
   ``The allegations against Frank Lorenzo and Texas Air are no
doubt correct, but our Danish employees should realize that
American trade unionism has a completely different style than it
does here,'' SAS Vice President Frede Eriksen was quoted as saying.
   SAS, which is 50 percent owned by the governments of Sweden,
Denmark and Norway, has tried to develop what its management calls
a ``global axis'' strategy to provide travelers with the most
convenient connections through a network of cooperation pacts with
other carriers.

   The chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board said Wednesday that his agency can no longer cover the cost
of rescuing ailing savings institutions without placing ``an
exceedingly heavy burden'' on the industry.
   M. Danny Wall, whose agency regulates the nation's 3,000 S&Ls,
told the Senate Budget Committee it will cost $45 billion to $50
billion to clean up the industry, boosting an earlier projection by
more than one-third.
   In July, Wall said it would cost $31 billion, an increase in
turn from a previous estimate of $22 billion.
   Noting that the bank board has resolved 122 cases so far this
year at a cost of $20 billion, Wall said it would cost an
additional $25 billion to $30 billion for the work that remains to
be done.
   As much as $10 billion of the cost remaining could be spent
between now and the end of the year to rescue dozens of additional
institutions, he said.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., chairman of the committee,
complained that Wall's shifting estimates ``offer little
reassurance to the taxpayer'' and said, ``We could be hearing about
a $100 billion problem just in time for Christmas.''
   Chiles also said the bank board, by issuing promissory notes
that are counted toward the federal budget deficit, was spending
billions of dollars without congressional authorization. That, he
said, would result in other programs, such as anti-drug efforts,
being squeezed.
   Wall's projections now are in line with other government
estimates, including the $45 billion to $50 billion projection of
Congress' General Accounting Office. Private analysts have put the
price tag as high as $100 billion.
   However, while the GAO said its cost estimate meant Congress
will have to appropriate taxpayer dollars, Wall said his agency's
resources could cover the cost. But, he said, that would place ``an
exceedingly heavy burden on the thrift industry.''
   Currently, the board's fund insuring deposits in S&Ls up to
$100,000 gets all of its money from healthy institutions, which pay
a special assessment amounting to more than double the regular
assessment paid by competing commercial banks for deposit insurance.
   Wall said the only way the bank board can get by without
additional funding would be to abandon plans to phase out the
special assessment and continue it for 30 years, a move sure to
provoke an outcry from S&L lobbyists.
   Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C., speaking at a separate session of the
House Banking Committee, argued that forcing the industry to pay
more could push healthy S&Ls into insolvency.
   The House committee voted 29-22 to approve a bill sponsored by
Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., that would increase from $10.8 billion
to $15.8 billion the bank board's authority to borrow through
bonds. The board has so far issued $3.75 billion of the 30-year
bonds, which are in turn paid off through the industry assessment.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., said
the bill could come before the full House as soon as Thursday. He
said the Senate would be ``hard put'' to reject the bill since it
had supported $15 billion in bond authority last summer when
Congress authorized the $10.8 billion.
   La Falce said his bill was intended to give the agency a way to
raise money without resorting to promissory notes that ultimately
could have to be paid off by taxpayers.
   But Neal said, ``If we burden the healthy thrifts with billions
of more dollars in interest payments, we run the risk of making the
problem worse.''
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, said a taxpayer bailout will be
needed sooner or later and that LaFalce's bill ``is just a ploy to
show we are trying to do something before the election.''
   The bill also requires the bank board to provide Congress with
all documents on its rescue deals within 15 days. Legislators have
complained that the agency has kept so much information private
that they have no way of judging the deals or estimating their
impact on the budget deficit.
   In a related matter, the full House postponed until Thursday
action on a bill creating a commission of experts to study the S&L
crisis and recommend solutions early next year. The Senate passed a
similar bill last month.

<HEAD>Analysts Say New Offer Puts Pressure on Kroger Co.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York investment company's latest offer
to buy the Kroger Co. for $5.03 billion may force Kroger's
management to accept the bid and abandon an effort to remain
independent, analysts say.
   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., a New York City-based company
known for corporate takeovers, improved its offer Tuesday to $64 a
share for the Cincinnati-based supermarket giant.
   The new offer may outweigh Kroger's proposed corporate
restructuring plan and force Kroger's management to give way so
that stockholders can get a better deal, analysts said.
   Kroger's management declined Wednesday to make a public
statement on the newest offer. ``All we've said is, we're reviewing
their proposal,'' Kroger spokesman Paul Bernish said.
   Kohlberg Kravis' offer is its second since it entered the Kroger
bidding war two weeks ago with a $4.6 billion bid, offering $58.50
per share.
   ``I think the purpose of this is a preemptive strike to keep
Kroger from wasting more time,'' said security analyst Gary Giblen
of the Houston investment company Rotan Mosle Inc. ``They're trying
to give Kroger an offer that is so demonstrably superior to
anything they (Kroger) can offer that they'll be forced to
capitulate.''
   The Haft family of Landover, Md., which controls Dart Group
Inc., opened the bidding Sept. 19 with an unsolicited offer of $55
per share, or $4.32 billion.
   Ryan Mathews, senior editor of the trade publication Grocery
Marketing, said Kohlberg's new bid intensifies pressure on Kroger's
management because of management's fiduciary duty to stockholders.
   ``They can't reject it out of hand,'' Mathews said.
   Analyst Elizabeth Shiels of Hilliard Lyons Inc. in Louisville,
Ky., said a better offer still could be made.
   ``I don't find it as compelling as I would have expected from
KKR,'' she said of Kohlberg's new offer. ``I think Kroger has done
enough public education on the value of the company that this isn't
a hands-down winner.''
   The new offer proposes paying $50 in cash, $11 in debentures and
a continuing equity interest in the company valued at $3 for each
of Kroger's 78.6 million shares.
   The offer tops by $7 a share Kroger's own offer to shareholders
in its board-approved restructuring plan, which would force Kroger
to lay off an undetermined number of employees at its headquarters.
The company also would sell some supermarkets, convenience stores,
mass-merchandising stores and real estate.
   The restructuring plan offers shareholders a $40 cash dividend,
a debenture with an $8 trading value and equity, or stub stock,
estimated at $9 per share, for a total value of $57.
   Kohlberg Kravis also presented an alternative offer, in the
event Kroger proceeds with its restructuring, to buy all of
Kroger's stub shares for $13.50 each _ $10 in cash and $3.50 in
debentures.
   Kohlberg Kravis said that would give the shareholders $61.50 per
share _ the $40 cash dividend from Kroger, $10 from Kohlberg and
$11.50 in debentures.
   The $2.50-per-share difference in Kohlberg's two proposals
represents the estimated cost of additional financing fees Kroger
would have to pay if it proceeds with restructuring, plus
Kohlberg's costs in refinancing the added debt Kroger would incur.
   ``We trust you will agree that this extra $2.50 per share in
value should be paid to your shareholders and not to your
lenders,'' Kohlberg Kravis partner George R. Roberts wrote in a
letter to Kroger chairman Lyle Everingham.
   Kohlberg Kravis said in its first offer that it would keep
Kroger's headquarters in Cincinnati if it buys the 105-year-old
company. The privately held Kohlberg Kravis has controlling
interests in about 30 companies, including Beatrice Cos.,
Owens-Illinois, Safeway Stores, Duracell Holdings and Stop & Shop
Cos.
   Fortune magazine estimated the combined 1987 revenues of
Kohlberg's companies at $38 billion.
   Dart Group has not said whether it would keep Kroger's
headquarters in Cincinnati.
   In response to Kohlberg's newest offer, Dart executive Robert
Haft said, ``We would be interested in working with Kroger
management to enhance their restructuring program by providing
additional equity.'' He did not elaborate.

<HEAD>State Leaders Don't Fear Grand Metropolitan As They Did Dart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED STYCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British company
bidding to take over Pillsbury Co., isn't terrifying state
officials, lawmakers and charitable organizations as Dart Group
Corp. did when it tried to seize Dayton Hudson Corp. last year.
   ``I think it's certainly not a similar situation in many
respects,'' Senate Minority Leader Duane Benson, IR-Lanesboro, said
Wednesday.
   ``It doesn't appear to be a situation in which (Grand
Metropolitan) may come into the community, plunder and leave when
they're done.''
   Both Pillsbury and Dayton Hudson are Minneapolis-based companies
that have earned favorite-son status for their high levels of
charitable giving and general community do-gooding.
   Last year, Minnesotans were horrified when Dart, controlled by
the Haft family of Maryland, tried to acquire Dayton Hudson in a
hostile takeover.
   The Hafts, with a reputation as corporate raiders who made
millions from profits on the sale of stock acquired from companies
they tried to take over, were considered poor corporate citizens.
   The Minnesota Legislature rode to the rescue and swiftly acted
on Dayton Hudson's request to pass tough anti-takeover legislation
in a one-day special session.
   But because Pillsbury is incorporated in Delaware, the new
Minnesota anti-takeover laws offer no help to the food conglomerate.
   And, because Grand Metropolitan has quickly presented itself as
a responsible company that would do little to upset the status quo,
Benson said, the state may not be as hasty to help Pillsbury as it
was to help Dayton Hudson.
   ``It's going to be tough to do for them (Pillsbury), because
they're incorporated in Delaware, not here,'' Benson said. ``It
would have to be pretty specific legislation.''
   House Speaker Robert Vanasek, DFL-New Prague, agreed.
   ``I'm not too excited about seeing a Minnesota-based company
being taken over by one that's headquartered outside the United
States, but I don't think there's really anything we could do about
it,'' Vanasek said.
   Still, he said, ``The Dart group has a terrible reputation when
it comes to being raiders, and at least Grand Met seems to be a
pretty solid company.''
   Vanasek, Benson and other state leaders, including Gov. Rudy
Perpich, met with Grand Metropolitan officials Tuesday, the day
they officially made their $5.17 billion bid for Pillsbury.
   Ian Martin, chief executive of Grand Metropolitan's U.S.
operations, who had asked for the meeting, said the company wasn't
seeking political favors, only a ``level playing field'' in dealing
with Pillsbury.
   ``I thought after having gone through the whole Dayton Hudson
situation, this was strange,'' Benson said. ``It was a reversal.
Dart certainly didn't come to talk to us.''
   But Benson thought the presentation was helpful.
   ``I think it certainly gave us a chance to understand their
point of view and what their attempts are,'' he said.
   ``I got the impression that they're not a corporate raider. If
they're successful at taking Pillsbury over, they'll keep that high
community identity.''
   State Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch said corporate
takeovers have changed since the Dayton Hudson deal. Now, companies
like Grand Metropolitan quickly approach politicians and the news
media to fend off negative publicity.
   ``What they (Grand Metropolitan) were trying to do was to
communicate the sincerity of their offer and that they do have a
background as a good corporate citizen,'' said Hatch, who also
attended Tuesday's meeting.
   Not only has Grand Metropolitan handled the situation
differently than Dart, Hatch said, but Pillsbury has handled it
differently than Dayton Hudson, which acted immediately after Dart
started its takeover attempt.
   Pillsbury, in a statement Tuesday, said its board would review
the Grand Met offer ``at an appropriate time.'' Company officials
refused to make further comment on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Prices Surge With Bullish News From Ivory Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of cocoa surged Wednesday at the Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange in New York on reports that the Ivory Coast _ the
world's largest producer _ would not be lowering farmer cocoa
prices.
   The expected move would come at a time when world cocoa prices
are at a 13-year low, and traders took the reports as an indication
that the Ivory Coast will continue to withhold cocoa from the world
market, analysts said.
   In other markets, oil prices plummeted, cattle futures prices
were mixed, hog prices were mostly lower, frozen pork bellies
declined, corn and soybeans slid, wheat prices advanced and gold
and silver prices rallied.
   The surge in cocoa prices comes at a time when world stocks are
at record level, and the Ivory Coast is about to begin harvesting
their new crop, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Talk that the African nation won't lower prices paid to cocoa
famers was ``taken as a sign by the market that the Ivory Coast ...
may perhaps continue (their) very limited sales policy,'' and that
could turn the surplus into a deficit, she said.
   Cocoa prices were $39 to $61 higher with the contract for
delivery in December at $1,228 a ton.
   At the New York Mercantile Exchange, reports of burgeoning
supplies and rumors about OPEC defections sent oil futures prices
plunging.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate dropped 47
cents to settle at $12.60 a barrel in heavy, hectic trading. The
benchmark U.S. crude traded as low as a $12.28 barrel during the
session.
   Crude oil was 12 cents to 47 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in November at $12.60 a barrel; heating oil was .41 cent
to .52 cent lower with November at 37.76 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gas was .55 cent to 1.67 cents lower with November at
39.44 cents a gallon.
   Profit-taking among corn and soybean traders after Tuesday's
rallies pressured prices at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   An outlook for favorable harvesting weather for the next several
days in the Corn Belt added pressure, analysts said.
   An anticipated overnight frost in key soybean-growing regions
that would have threatened crops failed to materialize and helped
keep the lid on buying enthusiasm in the bean pit, said Cathy Leow,
assistant vice president at Thompson McKinnon Securities, Inc. in
New York.
   Wheat gained support from continued expectations that signing of
the U.S.-Soviet grain pact is near, she said.
   Wheat prices settled 3 cents to 4\ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.26\ a bushel; corn was {
cent to 2 cents lower, with December at $2.93{ a bushel; oats were
1 cent to 2{ cents lower, with December at $2.46} a bushel; and
soybeans were 3 cents to 8{ cents lower, with November at $8.23 a
bushel.
   There were few outside influences at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the cattle market was ``undergoing some short-term
liquidations'' after reaching new contract highs in feeder cattle
on Tuesday, said Paul Hare, a Chicago analyst with Linnco Futures
Inc.
   Hog traders were hedging their positions in anticipation of
lower prices this fall, he said.
   Live cattle prices settled .40 cent lower to .35 cent higher,
with the contract for delivery in October at 72.02 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .43 cent lower to .15 cent higher with October
at 81.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .50 cent lower to .33 cent
higher with October at 40.20 cents a pound; and pork bellies were
.10 cent to .75 cent lower with February at 49.45 cents a pound.
   Trading was lackluster with few fundamental factors at the New
York Commodity Exchange and volume was thin as traders protected
their positions, analysts said.
   Gold was $2.60 to $2.70 higher, with October at $400.80 a troy
ounce; silver was up 5 cents in all contract months, with October
at $6.298 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Navy Switches Raft Contract Amid Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy said Wednesday it is rejecting life
rafts made by a West Virginia company and has hired B.F. Goodrich
Co. to finish the job.
   Allegations were made earlier this summer about the quality and
reliability of Mark 6 rafts produced by Rubber Crafters Inc. of
Grantsville, W.Va., said Navy spokesman Lt. Ken Ross.
   ``In light of these allegations, we are in the process of
testing the Rubber Crafters rafts we have in the fleet to make sure
there are no defective rafts there,'' he said.
   The Navy signed a $9.9 million contract with Goodrich to produce
850 of the same type of life rafts that are the subject of an
investigation, according to Ross. The new contract calls for the
rafts to be delivered to the Navy by April 1990, although they may
be ready sooner.
   Rubber Crafters had been building the Mark 6 rafts since 1984,
he said. The company is being investigated by the Defense
Department and the FBI.
   Federal agents raided the company's plant and offices Aug. 8,
according to The Pittsburgh Press.
   ``We have stopped accepting rafts from Rubber Crafters. We have
a need for additional rafts in the fleet, so we let the contract to
BF Goodrich,'' Ross said.
   Rubber Crafters had delivered 2,200 rafts and was under contract
to deliver another 1,300, he said. The company won the contract by
outbidding Goodrich.
   The Press quoted a federal affidavit as saying Rubber Crafters
used inferior materials, covered up defects, falsified test results
and altered boat serial numbers.

<TEXT>
   Gold prices climbed back above the
$400-a-troy-ounce level in New York trading Wednesday, while the
dollar marked time as traders awaited the release of new economic
figures.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid of $400.30 for a
troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $2.70 from late Tuesday's
$397.60.
   On the Commodity Exchange, a troy ounce of gold rose to $400.80
from $398.10 on Tuesday.
   Gold prices rose as traders followed the fortunes of crude oil
futures, said Jim Paul, director of futures research at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Bullion traders have been selling recently as the price of oil
plunged. Lower oil prices are a harbinger of lower inflation and
reduce the attractiveness of gold, which is a traditional hedge
against higher inflation.
   Oil prices continued to skid Wednesday, but Paul said gold
traders were heartened by the fact that the near-term contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, struggled back
from its lows of the day. The contract closed down 47 cents at
$12.60 a barrel, after having been down nearly 80 cents at one
point.
   ``The fact that (oil) was down 80 cents makes 40 cents look not
too bad,'' Paul said.
   Gold was down in earlier overseas trading. It fell in London to
a late bid price of $396 a troy ounce, compared with late Tuesday's
$397.45. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid $395.40 compared with
$396.90 late Tuesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.77 to close at a bid $400.46.
   Silver rose in New York after falling in London. Silver closed
at $6.298 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange, up from late
Tuesday's $6.248. In London, silver traded at a late bid price of
$6.19 a troy ounce, compared with Tuesday's $6.23.
   Meanwhile, the dollar was little changed in light trading.
   ``I think we're just poised and waiting to see how the
unemployment numbers come out on Friday,'' said Jack Barbanel, a
first vice president with Gruntal & Co. Inc. in New York. ``Most of
the trade stayed on the sidelines.''
   The Labor Department is scheduled to release September
unemployment figures on Friday. Barbanel said dollar traders are
also waiting for the Commerce Department's report next week on the
trade deficit.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.33 yen to a closing 133.48 yen from
Tuesday's 133.15 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher
rate of 133.65 yen, and in New York, the dollar rose to 133.38 yen
from 133.31 yen late Tuesday.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6955 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6945 late Tuesday.
The dollar was marginally higher against the pound in New York,
where sterling was quoted at $1.69385, down from $1.6952 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.86475 West German marks, up from
1.8646; 1.5826 Swiss francs, down from 1.58265; 6.3440 French
francs, down from 6.3460; 1,3900.00 Italian lire, up from 1,389.50;
and 1.20945 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2082.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.8625 West German marks, up from 1.8610; 1.5865
Swiss francs, up from 1.5775; 6.3540 French francs, up from 6.3285;
2.1020 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0950; 1,390.475 Italian lire, up

<HEAD>Banking Commissioner: Report Indicates Continuing Difficulty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas banks lost $2.9 billion in the six months of
1988, more than three times what they lost the first half of 1987,
says a report released Wednesday by Texas Banking Commissioner
Kenneth Littlefield.
   The report indicates continuing financial difficulty for Texas
banks, said a release by the Department of Banking.
   First RepublicBank's $1.9 billion provision for possible loan
losses contributed greatly to the loss, according to the report.
First RepublicBank now is under North Carolina National Bank.
   Texas banks' equity capital declined $3.5 billion, total assets
decreased $14.7 billion, and total deposits declined $12 billion
between June 30, 1987, and June 30, 1988, Littlefield noted.
   ``What it does show is that there are still problems in the
Texas banking industry,'' said Mark R. Largent, the financial
analyst who prepared the report.
   ``Although the state has problems, not all the problems are
equally troubling in all areas or for all size banks,'' he said.
   Average bank performance generally deteriorates the larger the
institution, the report said. The bigger banks generally have an
increasingly greater share of problem credits and foreclosed real
estate as a percentage of total assets, loans and primary capital,
it said.
   The 38 banks with assets of more than $500 million accounted for
$2.7 billion of the $2.9 billion loss, with FirstRepublic Banks
representing a $2.2 billion loss.

<HEAD>General Dynamics Gets Smaller Sub Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy on Wednesday awarded the General
Dynamics Corp. a $617.4 million contract for a new Trident missile
submarine, slashing more than $26.6 million off the price it paid
last year.
   Navy officials said the award demonstrated they had been right
in pressing a Virginia shipyard to compete against General Dynamics
more than a year ago, even if General Dynamics ultimately succeeded
in protecting its monopoly on the huge subs.
   ``It shows the benefits of competition,'' said Lt. Ken Ross, a
Navy spokesman. ``That previous competition ... is still bearing
fruit.''
   The contract awarded Wednesday represents the first of two
options in a contract initially awarded by the Navy in January
after competitive bidding between General Dynamics and the Newport
News Shipbuilding & Drydock Co.
   The award to General Dynamics' Electric Boat Division in Groton,
Conn., covers the one Trident submarine authorized by Congress in
the fiscal 1989 budget and will be the 16th in the line.
   The fixed-price contract specifies the Trident should be
delivered by October 1994. The Navy has said it wants to order at
least 20 Tridents and possibly more.
   With the exception of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the
Trident program was the last major Navy shipbuilding program to be
opened to competition. Newport News Shipbuilding, a division of
Tenneco Inc., enjoys a monopoly on the construction of aircraft
carriers, in part because no other shipyard has the massive
facilities required to build that type of ship.
   In November 1987, Newport News accepted a Navy request that it
compete against General Dynamics in the Trident program. It
submitted a bid for the fiscal 1988 sub as well as option bids on
the two additional boats expected to be purchased in fiscal 1989
and fiscal 1990.
   General Dynamics did the same, and last Jan. 5 the Navy
announced General Dynamics had succeeded in preserving its monopoly
by underbidding Newport News. The Navy awarded the firm a $644
million contract for the fiscal 1988 submarine, without revealing
what either company had bid for the two option years.
   Ross said Wednesday the Navy believes it will save roughly $100
million over the life of the contract if the second option is also
exercised.
   The spokesman said the latest award reverses what has been a
spiraling price for the huge vessels. The fiscal 1986 submarine
cost the Navy about $587 million. The price climbed to $615 million
in fiscal 1987, then rose again in January to $644 million.
   ``This contract is cutting more than $26 million off that fiscal
1988 buy,'' Ross said.
   The 560-foot Trident submarines _ also known as the Ohio class _
are considered the most survivable leg of America's nuclear
arsenal. Each of the vessels can carry 24 long-range, multi-warhead
nuclear missiles and remain submerged for months at a time.
   Each of the subs, when completely outfitted with nuclear
reactors and government-furnished equipment, cost more than $1.4
billion. Eight of the submarines are already commissioned on active
duty and a ninth _ the USS Tennessee _ will soon join them.

<HEAD>Eastern Recalls 300 Furloughed Flight Attendants Effective Oct. 21</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines on Wednesday announced the recall
of 300 furloughed flight attendants, which follows the recent
layoffs of more than 3,000 employees to streamline the money-losing
carrier's operations.
   The furloughed flight attendants are being recalled effective
Oct. 21 because of the popularity of a long-term leave of absence
program, said Eastern spokesman Robin Matell.
   The program was offered as ``a way of minimizing the impact of
furloughs,'' and more volunteers were attracted than had been
anticipated, Matell said. More than 500 flight attendants took the
leave offer.
   Now 300 fired flight attendants will be recalled on the basis of
seniority, Matell said.
   Last week, a federal appeals court in Washington struck down a
lower court judge who had barred Eastern from carrying out the
furloughs. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the union's
contention that the layoffs were part of a union-busting campaign
by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp. and its Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   Along with the furloughs, which took effect Sept. 10 and
represented Eastern's largest layoff plans in its 60-year history,
the carrier eliminated service to 14 cities and closed its Kansas
City hub.
   Eastern's recall coincides with a seasonal increase in flights
to core markets along the East Coast and into the Caribbean and
Latin America.
   Matell said additional employees also may be recalled.
   ``We have to evaluate staffing needs and determine what's
what,'' he said.

<HEAD>UNCTAD Chief Executive Welcomes Reaction To Reduction Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior U.N. official said Wednesday he is
pleased with the initial response from the international community
to a proposal that commercial lenders write off 30 percent of their
loans to 15 highly indebted Third World countries.
   But Kenneth Dadzie, Secretary General of the U.N. Conference on
Trade and Development, made clear that consensus on how to cope
with the debt crisis is far away.
   In a press statement, however, he voiced confidence that the
proposal, outlined in UNCTAD's 1988 report last month, ``served as
a catalyst for a rethinking of positions and will continue to do
so.''
   The countries targeted by the UNCTAD plan account for about 60
percent of Third World debt totaling some $500 billion. They are
Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ecuador,
Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Uruguay,
Venezuela, and Yugoslavia.
   Dadzie said that while the plan called for 30-percent cut of
commercial bank debt, ``our calculations can (perhaps) be improved
in either and upoward or downward direction.''
   He saiid it is increasingly obvious that large-scale debt
reduction ``cannot be accomplished by credit markets acting on
their own'' but that it required concerted action by creditors.
   Dadzie said recent statements by France, Japan and the director
oof the International Monetary Fund suggest ''that the need for
official action is gaining acceptance.''
   ``The form of the support, however, remains unclear,'' he added,
speaking of a ``highly complex situation.'' Dadzie's statement was
issued at the end of a two-week session of UNCTAD's 131-nation
governing body, the Trade and Development Board.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. agreed to hand
over a list of its stockholders to a group of dissident
shareholders Wednesday and said the group's attempt to wage a proxy
fight against Zenith management would not trigger the company's
takeover defense.
   Zenith agreed to give the list to Brookhurst Partners just
before a hearing in Delaware Chancery Court over the group's
attempt to wage a proxy battle to pressure the company into putting
itself up for sale.
   Just 20 minutes into the hearing, Zenith also surrendered on the
issue at stake in the proceeding: whether Brookhurst's proxy
solicitation would trigger Zenith's ``poison pill'' takeover
defense.
   Stephen Herrmann, Zenith's attorney, declared that the consent
solicitation of Sept. 14 would not trigger the rights plan, even if
15 percent of the shareholders' proxies were obtained by Brookhurst
Partners.
   This means Brookhurst is now free to solicit shareholder support
in its efforts to replace some company directors and sell Zenith.
   Brookhurst, which owns 6.1 percent of Zenith's stock, is
proposing to reduce the board from 10 members to six and replace
three of the six with its own candidates.
   Zenith, the only remaining U.S. television maker, is
incorporated in Delaware, but based in Glenview, Ill., north of
Chicago.
   The company has indicated its desire to remain independent, and
until Wednesday had resisted giving the shareholder list to
Brookhurst.
   Zenith has been fighting a losing battle against low-priced
imported televisions. Despite the success of its highly regarded
computers, Zenith suffered losses over the past three years,
including a $19.1 million loss last year on sales of $2.36 billion.

<TEXT>
   A California supermarket chain that pulled
tobacco and cigars from its shelves to comply with a new state law
on product labeling hinted Wednesday that all its food and drug
suppliers face a similar fate if they don't comply with the statute.
   Vons Cos. revealed it had given its suppliers 45 days notice
that they must either certify their products as free of dangerous
chemicals or label the products in keeping with California's
Proposition 65.
   Vons, which has 345 supermarkets in Southern California, pulled
pipe tobacco and cigars from its shelves this week because they
don't carry health warnings, as do packages of cigarettes and
chewing tobacco.
   Proposition 65, an initiative approved by California voters in
1986, requires warning notices in stores, the workplace, and other
areas where people might be exposed any of 242 substances _
including tobacco _ on a state list of chemicals known to cause
cancer or birth defects.
   Vons notified 2,000 manufacturers, suppliers and brokers they
must either certify their products as free of chemicals on the list
or label the products, spokeswoman Vickie Sanders said Wednesday.
That notice, in letters mailed Sept. 21, gives the suppliers 45
days to comply, she said.
   While the letter doesn't specifically threaten to remove
unlabeled products from the shelves, the tobacco action underlines
the chain's emphasis on labels.
   Safeway Stores Inc., Lucky Stores Inc. and Alpha Beta Co. have
mailed similar notices, spokesmen for the grocers said, although
Alpha Beta's letters don't specifically threaten to pull unlabeled
tobacco from the shelves.
   One of the authors of the toxins initiative hailed Vons' move as
the start of a wide trend toward product labeling. But the author,
David Roe of the Environmental Defense Fund, contended the El
Monte-based grocery chain did so only under threat of a lawsuit.
   ``What you see Vons doing is enforcing the law against the
manufacturers,'' Roe said from the fund's Oakland office. ``They're
saying, `Don't stick us with the warning.'''
   Previously, he said, California markets had resisted labeling
and contended that an industry-funded, toll-free telephone
information number on chemicals in food constituted sufficient
warning to consumers under Proposition 65.
   Two tobacco lobbying groups, the Cigar Association of America
and the Pipe Tobacco Council, contended the industry has met the
law's requirements by sending stores warning signs that can be
posted on shelves. Distribution of those signs and a program of
periodic media advertisements on the hazards of cigars and pipe
tobacco began in February, said Norman Sharp, who is president of
both Washington, D.C.-based groups.
   The antitoxins law sets penalties of $2,500 per violation per
day for failure to post warnings of hazardous chemicals. Rather
than designating a state agency as enforcer, the measure allows
citizens or the state attorney general to sue businesses which
don't comply.
   The grocers' notices to their suppliers all followed an
announcement Aug. 2 by several environmental groups that they were
prepared to sue seven supermarket chains and a drugstore chain over
tobacco labeling. On Friday, state Attorney General John Van de
Kamp took up the case from the environmental groups and filed suit
in state court against Vons, Lucky, Alpha Beta, Safeway, Ralph's,
Raley's, Albertson's and Thrifty Drugs.

   Volkswagen United States on Wednesday said it
was recalling about 1,700 late-1988 model Jetta cars to inspect and
replace, if necessary, a brake vacuum unit.
   Volkswagen said it was possible the unit could separate during
heavy braking, which would, in turn, diminish braking power.
   The company said in a news release it was aware of no accidents
or injuries due to the problem.
   Owners of the vehicles are being notified by mail. Inspection
and replacement of the unit, if necessary, would be free to the

   Unions at Eastern Airlines reacted angrily
Wednesday to a report that Texas Air Corp. was discussing the
possible sale of its East Coast air shuttle to developer Donald
Trump.
   The pilots union warned it would seek a court order to block any
such deal, and the head of the machinists union suggested his union
would do the same.
   The unions successfully blocked an attempt earlier this year by
Texas Air to transfer the shuttle operation from Eastern to a new
subisidiary.
   According to unidentified sources quoted by the Wall Street
Journal, the pricetag on the three-city shuttle was in the range of
$200 million.
   Texas Air spokesman Mark Johnson said the company had no comment
on the Journal report. Trump and his representatives also declined
comment.
   The New York Times, in its Thursday editions, quoted Trump as
saying he was close to agreement on a deal, and a contract could be
signed by next week. The newspaper also quoted unidentified
executives it said were close to the deal as saying Trump would pay
more than $300 million cash for the shuttle.
   Trump was dealing directly with Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo
in the deal, the Times quoted its sources as saying.
   The report came a day after Texas Air signed an agreement with
Scandinavian Airlines System giving the European carrier leases on
airport gates in the New York area and the right to buy up to 10
percent of Texas Air's stock on the open market.
   SAS will pay Texas Air $50 million under the accord, which also
includes provisions for coordinating marketing, reservations and
scheduling as well as training of airline personnel.
   In Miami, Eastern pilots union spokesman Ron Cole said the union
``will take whatever steps are necessary to legally protect Eastern
from the sale or transfer of any more of its assets.''
   The leader of the Machinists union said Eastern employees
probably would challenge any sale of the shuttle.
   ``We stopped the spinoff to Texas Air. It's something we will
have to look at as it relates to our ongoing litigation,'' said
Charles E. Bryan, head of the Machinists union at Eastern.
   The Machinists filed a federal suit earlier this year to block
the plan to make Eastern's shuttle a separate subsidiary of Texas
Air. Texas Air later dropped that effort.
   While stressing they did not know if the report was true, some
Wall Street analysts said Trump might use the shuttle, which
operates between Washington, New York and Boston, to help draw
people to his hotel and casino properties in Atlantic City, N.J.
Others expressed skepticism.
   ``I think it makes some eminent sense,'' said Julius Maldutis,
an airline analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.
   One skeptic, John Pincavage of PaineWebber Inc., suggested it
would be difficult for Trump to revamp the shuttle to accommodate
traffic to Atlantic City. The shuttle service, one of the most
profitable operations of ailing Eastern, is mainly geared toward
business passengers.
   Texas Air would more likely sell aircraft or routes to raise
cash, rather than a lucrative shuttle operation, Pincavage said. He
suggested that discussions with Trump could be a way of putting a
pricetag on the shuttle in case Eastern declared bankruptcy and it
had to be sold.
