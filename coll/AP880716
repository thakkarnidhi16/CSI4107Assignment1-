   A swarm of bees attacked a group of
young campers on a nature hike, stinging several of them up to a
dozen times and sending 12 children to hospitals, authorities said.
   ``All we could do was run and swat,'' said Stephen Hill, 10, who
was stung in the back, neck and arms.
   Twelve of the 30 children suffering stings were hospitalized
briefly and released in good condition, said spokesmen for
University Community Hospital in Tampa and East Pasco Medical
Center in Zephyrhills.
   ``You could literally almost pull (the insects) off of them,''
said Shari Brown, head counselor for Tampa's Palnez Summer Day Camp.
   A group of 42 children, ages 6 to 11, and counselors were
exploring the Rapids Trail in Hillsborough River State Park when
they were suddenly attacked by the swarm.
   During the onslaught, youngsters scattered screaming through the
woods, trying to get off the trail, Ms. Brown said. Two of the four
counselors were stung several times as they attempted to round up
the hysterical children.
   A few of the children who had run ahead of the group may have
disturbed the bees, which could have been feeding or defending a
nearby hive, park manager Perry Smith said, adding that he didn't
know what kind of bees they were.
   Park personnel who later walked the trail could find no sign of
the bees or a hive.

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced For Using Morgue Body To Fake Own Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who tried to fake her own
death by using an unclaimed corpse from the morgue has been
sentenced to two years in prison for falsely claiming a body.
   Among the many flaws investigators found in the scheme were the
fact the defendant weighed 65 pounds less than the corpse and
lacked its tattoos.
   Sandra P. Hall, 35, who is halfway through a four-year probation
term for welfare fraud, was sentenced Thursday in Los Angeles
County Superior Court for falsely obtaining an unclaimed body. She
had pleaded no contest to the charge.
   Her mother, Helen M. Tilch, 59, of the Los Angeles suburb of San
Fernando, has pleaded no contest to similar charges for helping Ms.
Hall in the scheme and faces a possible prison sentence.
   Deputy District Attorney Janice L. Maurizi contended the women
concocted the scheme to elude probation officers and creditors. Ms.
Hall, who told authorities she got the idea from a television
program, said she was trying to escape from an abusive ex-husband.
   ``The people you are dealing with here have been involved in
schemes all their lives,'' said Los Angeles police Detective
Stephen Fisk.
   Ms. Hall, who lives in Tulare County, and her mother obtained
the remains of Jane Doe No. 70, an unidentified, partly decomposed
body at the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.
   Identifying herself as Sharon J.T. Agee, Ms. Hall claimed that
the corpse was her sister, Sharon P. Hall. Her mother backed up the
story.
   After having the body cremated, they sent a copy of the death
certificate to probation officials.
   A probation officer reviewing the alleged death noticed the
physical discrepancies while reading the autopsy report, and
contacted police. Jane Doe No. 70 weighed 195 pounds to Ms. Hall's
130, and the corpse also had numerous tattoos.
   Further checks found the fingerprints from the body were
different from Ms. Hall's.

   Engineers today sought the source of
a small gas leak in a space shuttle steering engine, a new problem
NASA officials said could further delay the first shuttle flight
since the Challenger explosion.
   Experts were probing deep into Discovery's left Orbital
Maneuvering System engine pod in an effort to locate the leak. But
the leak was so tiny it was difficult to isolate, and the process
could take several days, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   Launch pad workers detected an odor of nitrogen tetroxide gas
Friday while preparing Discovery for its planned early September
launch, she said. It was in a pod covering one of the two engines
used to maneuver the shuttle in orbit.
   Nitrogen tetroxide serves as an oxidizer in the engines,
providing oxygen to ignite the fuel when the shuttle is in
oxygen-poor space.
   Officials could not say whether the leak would further delay the
launch, already postponed several times since NASA set a liftoff
date for last February, Malone said.
   ``It will depend on where the leak is and how severe it is,''
Malone said.
   Officials said they believed the leak was in one of three
places: a power valve, an oxidizer tank filter or a jet thruster.
   If the leak is too inaccessible to be repaired on the pad,
Malone said Discovery might have to be returned to an assembly
building, a move officials estimated could delay the launch by
several weeks.
   When initially detected, the leak rate was 15 parts per million,
considered very minor, Malone said. The rate later dropped to 3 or
4 ppm, she said.
   Discovery is being readied for the first space shuttle flight
since the Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts 2{
years ago.
   Elsewhere, engineers at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah
continue to inspect a solid fuel booster rocket damaged last week
when a joint was mistakenly overpressurized.
   A ground test-firing of the rocket has been delayed from late
July until at least mid-August while experts consider what repairs
have to be made.
   The test, the fifth full-scale firing of the redesigned rocket,
is considered essential before Discovery can be committed to
flight. A faulty booster rocket joint triggered the Challenger
explosion.

   Two female teachers were fired
after partially undressing in front of their 1st and 2nd grade
pupils as part of a sex education class, a city education
administrator said.
   ``The teachers were fired because the concensus here was that
they went overboard in their sex education demonstration,'' Osvaldo
Feliz Oliveira, the administrator who dismissed the teachers, said
Friday. ``It's one thing for kids to see this kind of thing on TV
and another to see it in the classroom.''
   He said the teachers were fired Wednesday after an inquiry
determined that they showed parts of their bodies to the pupils
during the class on April 23. He identified the teachers as Maria
Calabressi Tresoldi, 29; and Maria Vicente Barbosa, 24.
   Another teacher who observed the sex education class and the
parents of some pupils were among 20 people who testified at the
administrative inquiry in the town of Osorio, 990 miles southwest
of Rio de Janeiro.
   The administrator said the incident prompted parents of some
pupils to transfer them to another school.

   A judge declared a mistrial Friday in
the case of an airline pilot accused of murdering his wife and
destroying her body with a chain saw and wood chipper.
   After 17 days of deliberations, a juror refused to continue or
even to reappear in the courtroom so the case could be recessed
until Saturday, Superior Court Judge Barry Schaller said in
announcing the mistrial Friday night.
   State's Attorney Walter Flanagan said he would decide next week
whether to seek another trial.
   ``Twelve people took an oath to do a job and 11 were willing to
do so and one was not,'' Flanagan said.
   The jury had declared itself deadlocked about 4:35 p.m. Friday.
But Schaller ordered jurors to continue to try to reach a verdict
in the trial of Richard Crafts, which started April 4.
   Schaller said juror Warren Maskell Jr. of Preston told him: ``I
am sorry, but after voting eight times in at least a week with the
same results, I cannot continue to deliberate in a clear and open
mind. I am truly sorry.''
   A source who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press that Maskell was the lone juror who refused to
vote for conviction.
   Crafts, a 50-year-old pilot for Eastern Airlines and part-time
police officer, was arrested in January 1987 and charged with the
murder of his Danish-born wife, Helle. The arrest came after body
parts were found by state police on the banks of the Housatonic
River in Southbury.
   Mrs. Crafts, a 39-year-old stewardess for Pan American World
Airlines and mother of three young children, was last seen on Nov.
18, 1986 when co-workers dropped her off at the Crafts' Newtown
home after an overseas flight.
   Defense attorney J. Daniel Sagarin said his client was
disappointed by the outcome, saying Crafts wanted a verdict so ``he
could go back to his children.'' Sagarin said he would seek a
reduction in Crafts' bond next week. Crafts has been held in lieu
of $750,000 bail since his arrest.
   Maskell, 47, suffered head injuries in a car accident on Friday,
July 1. He was hospitalized briefly, but he told Schaller when
court reconvened July 5 that he felt he was able to continue
deliberations.
   The judge said that while the 12-member jury was sending out for
supper Friday night, Maskell left the jury room and refused to
return.
   The judge quoted Maskell as saying, ``I'm out of there and I'm
not going back in there.''
   The judge said an effort was made to ``let the situation cool
off,'' but Maskell wouldn't budge, despite requests from several
other jurors that he join them.
   Schaller said he decided then to have the jurors return to the
courtroom and recess until Saturday morning for one more attempt at
deliberations, but Maskell refused, telling a bailiff that he
wouldn't come unless he was ``carried in.''
   At that point, the judge said, he asked the jury's foreman in a
note if further deliberations would be useful, and the foreman
responded in writing, ``Yes. Definitely.'' Maskell responded to the
same question in another note, ``I do not believe so.''
   Prosecutor Flanagan said he agreed with the defense that the
court was left with no alternative but to declare a mistrial.
   Earlier Friday, the jury sent the judge a note saying that there
was a ``strong majority,'' but that it was at an impasse and
desired further instructions. It didn't say whether the majority
favored conviction or acquittal.
   Schaller told the jury that those in the minority should closely
examine the views of the majority in an effort to reach a unanimous
verdict.
   He said a dissenting juror should consider whether his or her
doubt is a reasonable one when it makes no impression on the other
jurors.
   The defense objected to the instructions.
   Prosecutors said they didn't know how Crafts killed his wife,
but they presented evidence they said proved he used a chain saw
and wood chipper to dispose of her body.
   More than 100 witnesses and 650 exhibits were presented over 53
days of the trial, which was moved to New London from Danbury
because of pretrial publicity over the case.

<TEXT>
   The chief negotiator of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and the head of the private Arms
Control Association say the Reagan administration is trying in its
waning months to scuttle the accord.
   Gerard C. Smith, the former negotiator, and Spurgeon Keeny Jr.,
head of the arms control group, leveled the accusations Friday as
President Reagan weighed conflicting opinions from his senior
advisers on what to do.
   The U.S. military joint chiefs of staff urged him to hold to the
treaty while William F. Burns Jr., head of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency, recommended that he charge Moscow with a
``material breach'' of the treaty.
   The Reagan administration, meanwhile, is awaiting a response
from Moscow on a date for a five-year review of the ABM treaty,
considered a cornerstone of the arms control process.
   At issue is the Soviet phased array radar station at Krasnoyarsk
that Reagan has already labeled a violation of the 1972 treaty in
two reports to Congress. While the Soviets deny any infraction,
even many liberal critics of the administration's arm control
policy question the legality of the facility.
   The treaty limits U.S. and Soviet defenses against ballistic
missiles and stands in the way of Reagan's quest for a space-based
defense against Soviet rockets.
   Keeny said that although the Soviet installation ``is
inconsistent with the ABM treaty's provisions, labeling Krasnoyarsk
as a material breach would be a gross exaggeration of its military
and legal significance and clearly is designed as a last-gasp
effort to kill the ABM treaty in the waning days of the
administration rather than solve the problem.''
   Former negotiator Smith said ``having been blocked by Congress
from killing the treaty through reinterpretation, it appears the
administration is trying to find another way to kill the treaty.''
   A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press that even if Reagan accepted the advice of Burns
and other hard liners, it did not mean he would abandon the treaty.
   The chiefs recommended that Reagan not charge the Soviets with a
material breach because that could lead to an unraveling of the
treaty, the official said. ``The chiefs are convinced if that
happens the Soviets are in a better position to take advantage of a
breakout,'' the official said.
   This puts the chiefs at odds with Burns, who takes a harder
stance on the treaty than the military but would give the Soviets
time to level the facilities before the United States retaliated.
   Reagan is not likely to make a decision until a date for review
is set with the Soviets. ``We're still working on it,'' the
official said.
   Reagan's senior advisers discussed the issue at an unpublicized
meeting last week of the National Security Planning Group and did
not reach a consensus.
   Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, declined on Monday
to discuss the options presented to Reagan. ``No decision has been
made,'' the spokesman said. ``The issue is under review.''
   Fitzwater said ``there are sound and valid arguments on both
sides of the question'' and that Reagan would make a decision
``before the review.''
   The treaty constrains defenses against ballistic missiles on the
theory a potential aggressor might hold back if his country faced
retaliatory devastation.
   The treaty limits how fast and far the United States can go in
its search for a space-based defense against ballistic missiles
that uses such sophisticated technology as laser beams and kinetic
energy.
   The program, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative,
is being carried out under what the Reagan administration describes
as a ``strict interpretation'' of the 1972 treaty. A broader
interpretation would provide more leeway, while scrapping the
treaty would remove all legal restraints.

   Despite rumbles of discontent from Jesse Jackson,
Michael Dukakis is confidently predicting Jackson will campaign
actively for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket in the fall campaign.
   ``I want him involved, I want his staff people involved,''
Dukakis said Friday in a wide-ranging interview in the governor's
office at the Massachusetts Statehouse.
   Jackson had shown disappointment over Dukakis' choice of Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the vice presidential nomination, but on
Friday he called the idea of a convention challenge to the choice a
``moot question.''
   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager, said the campaign ``has
no present plans to put Jesse Jackson's name up for vice
president.''
   Sitting in shirt sleeves in his office, Dukakis sounded upbeat
as he looked ahead to his trip to Atlanta for the Democratic
convention that will culminate a marathon campaign Wednesday by
naming him the party's presidential nominee.
   ``I can't remember a time when we've (the Democrats) been more
together,'' said Dukakis.
   In the interview, he also:

<TEXT>
   _Said he had pretty much decided on Bentsen when he met with
aides in his kitchen on Monday night. ``The discussion I had with
folks there was not unhelpful, but I was more interested in talking
to them about how we handle it, what are the mechanics of this.''
   _Denied the decision already had been made before Paul Brountas,
the lawyer who headed his vice presidential search, met with
Jackson earlier the same day. ``No, no, I didn't say that,'' he
said when asked if that were the case.
   _Said ``That's for you to decide'' when asked if Vice President
George Bush's appearance at the United Nations on Thursday to
explain the United States' position on the downing of an Iranian
airliner was more political than diplomatic. ``I'm not going to
second guess the vice president,'' he said.
   _Abruptly dismissed the notion that a mediator _ former
President Jimmy Carter was suggested _ was needed to resolve
differences between him and Jackson. ``We don't need mediators,''
he said. ``We talk and continue to.''
   _Said of the state budget crisis that has been a potential
embarrassment, ``I'm going to have a balanced budget by the end of
this week.'' The state legislature has met into the night all week
in an effort to come up with a $400 million defecit-closing plan.
Aides said Dukakis expected to sign a bill hours before flying to
Atlanta on Sunday.
   Dukakis said that he thought the Democrats reflected ``a broad
national consensus'' on such issues as trade, plant closings,
health care and the environment.
   ``I think that's the reason you just don't have these deep
ideological divisions that you often have had in the past.''
   He said his staff and Jackson's have ``very good relations'' and
that he hoped to ``begin to bring (Jackson aides) into the campaign
in important, responsible positions. The sooner we can get on with
that the better.''
   The nominee-to-be acted unconcerned about the perception he had
so far failed to put his stamp on the upcoming convention.
   ``There are 4,000 delegates who worked very hard to get elected
to that convention,'' he replied. ``They make the decisions. In the
last analysis, they're going to decide who the nominees are,
they're going to decide what kind of a platform we have. ... And
that's whose convention it is.''
   ``My job is go to the convention, to win the nomination and to
make sure the person I've asked to serve as my running mate gets
the nomination, to work hard with the delegates to get a good
platform and at the same time to begin the final drive,'' he said.

   A House subcommittee has asked the head of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to respond to a
published report that she vetoed a staff recommendation for a
federal safety standard on the rollover of sport utility vehicles.
   The request was made Friday in a letter to NHTSA Administrator
Diane Steed from Reps. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, and John Dingell,
D-Mich.
   The lawmakers asked for ``all internal letters, notes,
memoranda, studies, etc.'' connected with her decision to reject a
petition to set safety standards for the Jeep-like vehicles and
recall those that fail to meet the standards.
   The lawmakers cited a Wall Street Journal report of May 23 which
said that according to internal agency documents, Ms. Steed last
summer vetoed a recommendation from four major NHTSA departments to
establish such a standard.
   A NHTSA spokesman said there was no one at the agency
immediately available to respond to the lawmakers' comments.
   Since 1984, NHTSA's regulations have required a special label to
be placed on all utility vehicles warning of possible rollovers
following sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers. And last April, the
agency announced it was issuing a consumer information pamphlet
about special precautions drivers of the on- and off-road vehicles
should take.
   ``A warning label and a pamphlet may not be enough,'' said
Luken, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce transportation
subcommittee. ``NHTSA's recent report to Congress showed that in
1986 the death rate from rollovers for utility vehicles was more
than double that for passenger cars.''

<HEAD>Rights Commission Puts Off Adoption of Asian Discrimination Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is
delaying adoption of an extensive report showing that some groups
of Asian Americans tend to earn more than American whites.
   Several commission members said Friday they want the report to
be reviewed by experts on Asian discriminatio. One said the report
could lead to more prejudice against Asian Americans.
   The 289-page report, ``The Economic Status of Americans of Asian
Descent,'' examines census, immigration and other statistics on six
ethnic groups: Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, Asian Indians
and Vietnamese.
   The report by economists on the commission staff says that
native-born U.S. citizens of Japanese and Korean descent earn more
than Caucasians, while those with Chinese heritage earn about the
same and Filipinos and Indians earn less.
   Commission member Mary Frances Berry, expressing concern that
the report might downplay discrimination, said, ``I'm trying to
keep the job from being done on Asian Americans that has already
been done on black men.'' The commission released a report in 1986
that showed that income gaps between black and white men had
decreased dramatically since the 1940s.
   Ms. Berry, one of three black members of the commission, which
includes no Asian Americans, said income is not the only measure of
discrimination and there is a danger that when other Americans see
how well Asian immigrants are doing financially, discrimination
will increase.
   Commissioner Robert A. Destro said the commission does not want
to be in the position of saying to minorities: ``See, everything is
okay. You make a lot of money anyway.''
   Six of the seven commission members voted to postpone adoption
of the report prepared by the commission staff until at least its
September meeting in Los Angeles. The commission is an independent
federal agency, with half its board members appointed by the
president and half by Congress. One seat on the board is vacant.
   The report says there is no evidence the across-the-board
discrimination that existed against Asians in the 1960s exists in
the 1980s.
   ``Adjusting for changing skills and characteristics, the
earnings gap between Asian and non-Hispanic white men decreased
dramatically between 1960 and 1980,'' says an executive summary
included in the report. ``This finding suggests that the economic
progress of Asian men was aided by a decline in anti-Asian labor
market discrimination.''
   The report, however, shows differences between Asian men and
women, between Asian Americans born in the United States and recent
immigrants, and among the six ethnic groups examined.
   It looks at an Asian American population of 3.26 million, making
up about 1.5 percent of the U.S. population.
   It cites evidence that new immigrants from Asia initially earn
less than similar non-Hispanic white immigrants but that they end
up earning more after about 11 years in this country.
   Asian women, both immigrants and native-born, tend to earn more
than white women, the report said. It noted that that more Asian
American women work, partly because the more closely knit family
structure with many relatives often living together allows other
family members to take care of children.
   Poverty rates for U.S.-born Chinese, Japanese and Korean
families are lower than the general population, while poverty rates
for Filipino and Indian families are higher, and Vietnamese
immigrant families have substantially higher levels of poverty,
according to the report.
   James Cunningham, assistant staff director who oversaw the
project, said the data raise several questions requiring further
research, including the possibility of discrimination at higher
levels of employment.
   He said that Asians are over-represented in professional jobs
but under-represented in managerial positions. ``We don't know
whether this is by choice or because of discrimination,''
Cunningham said.
   He said that while Asians are showing overall success in many
areas and discrimination has decreased, prejudices still affect
some Asian groups.
   ``This is by no means to say there is an Asian success story,''
he said.

   A federal task force headed by Secretary of
Agriculture Richard Lyng will visit Indiana, Missouri, Tennessee
and Ohio on Tuesday as it kicks off a tour of 10 drought-stricken
states.
   A schedule released Friday by the White House shows stops in
Mansfield, Ohio; Lafayette, Ind.; Jackson, Tenn., and Cape
Girardeau, Mo., on Tuesday.
   On Wednesday, the group is to tour locations around Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, Aberdeen, S.D., and Grand Forks, N.D.
   The inspection trip will wind up Thursday with stops at St.
Cloud, Minn.; Lacrosse, Wis., and Midland, Mich.
   The group will return to Washington on Thursday afternoon.
   President Reagan announced plans for the inspection trip during
his own visit to drought-afflicted farm areas in Southern Illinois
on Thursday,.
   On the return flight to Washington aboard Air Force One,
Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said he believed there were
11 states on the tour, giving rise to erroneous reports that
Oklahoma would be included.

   Federal prison officials are being ordered to
transfer into the general prison population two women who were held
in an isolation unit at a Kentucky institution because of their
radical political beliefs.
   U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker, in a ruling Friday, said
``the designation of prisoners solely for their subversive
statements and thoughts is the type of overreaction that the
Supreme Court has repeatedly warned against.''
   Parker barred the Bureau of Prisons from ``considering a
prisoner's past political association or personal political
beliefs'' in deciding on transfers within federal prisons.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union's National Prison Project, the Center for
Constitutional Rights, the People's Law Office and private
attorneys challenging regulations that allowed the isolation of
prisoners based on their political beliefs or affiliations.
   It was filed on behalf of three women held in the high-security
isolation unit at the Federal Correctional Institution in
Lexington, Ky. Lawyers for the women said they had been treated so
inhumanely that they might be permanently psychologically harmed.
   Parker ordered the Bureau of Prisons to rewrite its regulations
and to transfer Silvia Baraldini and Susan Rosenberg, alleged
members of leftist political groups, into the general prison
population.
   ``Defendants may be concerned that the two plaintiffs will
persuade inmates within the general prison population to share
their political views but those fears cannot be accommodated at the
expense of constitutional rights,'' he wrote in his opinion.
   He added: ``The treatment of the plaintiffs has skirted
elemental standards of human decency. The exaggerated security,
small group isolation and staff harassment serve to constantly
undermine the inmates' morale.''
   A third prisoner represented in the lawsuit, Sylvia Brown, had
not been placed in the isolation unit because of her political
beliefs and was not covered by transfer order, said the ACLU's
Alexa Freeman.
   Adjoa Aiyetoro, lead counsel for the prisoners, said the ruling
was a ``tremendous victory.''
   ``The decision vindicates the rights of prisoners to hold
beliefs based on conscience,'' she said.
   Elizabeth Sink, a cooperating attorney with the Center for
Constitutional Rights, hailed the ruling and said the isolation
unit ``is an example of the human rights violations that this
country engages in.''
   John C. Cleary, who represented the Bureau of Prisons in the
lawsuit, declined to comment on the ruling. At a hearing before
Parker last month, Cleary argued that the women were transferred
into the unit because they posed ``a risk of external assault on
the prison.'' He said there was no medical evidence to support
claims they had suffered psychological harm.
   The bureau has announced plans to close the Lexington unit and
transfer prisoners to a new high security unit at Marianna, Fla.
Parker warned the bureau to be careful that conditions at the new
unit ``do not lead to wanton and unnecessary inflictions of
psychological pain.''
   ``Consigning anyone to a high security unit for past political
associations they will never shed unless forced to renounce them is
a dangerous mission for this country's prison system to continue,''
he said.
   ``This court is afraid that the Marianna facility will
automatically assume many of the problems haunting the Lexington
unit.''
   Rosenberg is serving a 58-year term for possessing weapons and
explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in New Jersey and
is one of seven recently indicted in the 1983 bombing of the U.S.
Capitol.
   Baraldini was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy in aiding
a $1.6 million Brink's armored car heist in Nyack, N.Y., in 1981
that left a guard and two police officers dead. Rosenberg was
linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled Brink's
robbery.

<HEAD>Bess Myerson Pleads Guilty To Shoplifting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Miss America and television
personality Bess Myerson pleaded guilty Friday to shoplifting,
seven weeks after her arrest at a department store.
   Miss Myerson, 64, was arrested by South Williamsport Police
Chief Charles Smith May 27 after leaving the Hills store with $44
in merchandise. She said at the time, and reiterated in a statement
handed to reporters Friday that she was only ``leaving the store to
lock (her) car'' and planned to return and ``pay for the
merchandise.''
   Her attorney delivered the signed guilty plea to the retail
theft charge Friday morning to the office of District Justice John
M. McDermott.
   ``I represent that I make this plea knowingly, voluntarily and
intelligently. I plead guilty,'' the form signed by Miss Myerson
said.
   McDermott fined Myerson $100, plus $48.50 court costs.
   ``That's the normal fine and costs for a first offense,'' he
said. ``It's over with.''
   According to published reports, Miss Myerson was also arrested
for shoplifting in London in the early 1970s.
   However, Assistant District Attorney Kenneth Osokow said that
based on the state crimes code, the London offense cannot be
considered a prior retail theft arrest here because it occurred
prior to the adoption of the new state shoplifting law.
   The fine was paid by Miss Myerson's attorney when he delivered
the guilty plea. The $150 bail she posted at the time of her arrest
is being returned to the New York City resident, who faces federal
charges for allegedly trying to influence the judge handling the
divorce of her reputed lover, Carl A. Capasso.
   Capasso is serving a sentence at nearby Allenwood Federal Prison
Camp for tax evasion.
   Myerson reigned as Miss America in 1945 and most recently served
as New York City cultural affairs commissioner.

   More than 5,000 hunters met Friday's
deadline to apply for just 235 licenses in Florida's first
alligator hunt in 25 years. The lucky winners won't be allowed to
use guns.
   Once an endangered species, the American alligator now numbers
about 1 million in Florida and is increasingly encountering humans
as the state's people population also grows.
   A 4-year-old girl was killed by an alligator in May near her
family's lakeside home in Englewood, in southwest Florida, but
planning for the hunt had been under way long before that.
   The Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission gave final approval
Friday, during a meeting in Ocala, for the trapping and killing of
up to 3,425 alligators in 20 wildlife management areas during the
30-day hunt this fall. That quote assumes that not every hunter
will get his full 15-animal limit.
   Commission spokesman Scott Ball said 15,000 applications were
printed and he was surprised that only 5,000 people applied.
   ``A lot of people have been calling up in the last few days that
have been procrastinating and kicking themselves for waiting until
the last minute,'' said Ball. ``They are asking about next year.''
   The sanctioned hunts will occur only at night and trappers will
have to use snares, harpoons, spears or similar weapons to get a
gator close enough to kill. The only firearm allowed will be a
``bangstick,'' a pole with a shotgun shell on the end that is used
to kill a gator once it is snared and brought up to a boat, said
Ball.
   Part of the motivation for hunting gators may be economic. Gator
meat sells for about $5 a pound; hide sells for about $40 a foot.
   Florida residents selected by lottery for the hunt will have to
pay a $250 license fee, plus a $30 tag fee for each gator they
catch up. Out-of-state hunters will have to pay $1,000 for the
licenses.
   In addition to the license fees and tag fees, those awarded
licenses will have to go through a six-hour training course in
early August, said Ball.
   The targeted reptiles will have to be at least 4 feet long.
   The tag fee is to pay for inspection and verification that hides
being prepared for market are legal.
   ``It's tightly regulated so that only legal hides will be
brought to marketplace,'' said Ball. ``There are only a few
processors of hides. We keep an eye on them.''
   Since the mid-1960s, alligator hunting virtually has been banned
except for isolated experimental hunts since 1982 and the removal
of nuisance alligators in populated areas.

<HEAD>Actor Timothy Dalton Begins Filming of Latest Bond Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filming of the latest James Bond
movie, ``License Revoked,'' starring actor Timothy Dalton in a
reprise role, is ready to begin in Mexico City, United Artists
announced.
   Dalton, 42, is cast as the suave British secret agent opposite
Robert Davi, who plays a tyrannical Latin American drug lord. Cast
as femme fatales are Carey Lowell and Talisa Soto. Filming is set
to begin Monday, the studio said.
   In ``License Revoked,'' Bond is cashiered by the British Secret
Service as he becomes embroiled in a personal mission of vengeance.
   The Hamlet-like role should be a cinch for Dalton, a
Shakespearean actor whose stage credits include ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' and ``Taming of the Shrew.''
   The 20-week production schedule will be shot on locations in
Mexicali, Durango, Vera Cruz, Isla Mujeres, Acapulco and Key West,
Fla.
   ``License Revoked'' will be the 18th James Bond film, if you
count the Peter Sellers' spoof ``Casino Royale,'' and is produced
by Albert R. ``Cubby'' Broccoli, the veteran Bond filmaker, and
Michael G. Wilson. The director is John Glen.

   Pop singer Jonathan ``Chico'' DeBarge was
dropped from the Sheriff's Department anti-drug telethon this
weekend after he was arrested for investigation of ferrying 2.2
pounds of cocaine, officials said.
   ``I wouldn't say it's embarrassing. We didn't want to send out
the wrong message,'' telethon organizer Sgt. Richard Shaw said
Friday.
   The telethon begins this afternoon and runs through early Sunday
to raise money for the Substance Abuse Narcotics Education program,
or SANE. The 3-year-old program is designed to help elementary
school students avoid drugs.
   DeBarge, 22, was free on $500,000 bail in Grand Rapids, Mich.,
after his arrest last week for investigation of transporting
cocaine from Los Angeles to Michigan. Although free, DeBarge may
not leave the area without permission, federal authorities said.

   The wife of Soviet emigre writer
Alexander Solzhenitsyn denied a German radio report that she and
her husband would return to their homeland for a visit and that his
works would be published there.
   The Munich-based Bayerischer Rundfunk radio station said
Solzhenitsyn and his wife planned to visit the Soviet Union in
November or December and that the Soviet Union wanted to publish
all his works, including the novella ``Cancer Ward'' and the
non-fiction ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' an expose of terror and
hopelessness in Soviet labor camps.
   It said the information came from its correspondent in New York
City.
   But Natalya Solzhenitsyn said, ``I never talked to (an) unnamed
reporter from New York.''
   ``Everything is (a) lie. Everything is false,'' Mrs.
Solzhenitsyn said Friday in a telephone interview from her home in
Cavendish, Vt.
   Solzhenitsyn incurred the wrath of the Soviet Union's leadership
with novels such as ``The First Circle.'' In February 1974,
Solzhenitsyn was arrested, formally accused of treason, stripped of
his citizenship and deported to the West.
   He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970.

   Dr. Whitney Houston? The pop singer liked
the sound of it after receiving an honorary doctorate degree from
Grambling State University for her contribution to the arts through

   Houston, who never attended college, is a two-time Grammy winner

from her New Jersey home by her parents, John and Cissy Houston.
   She urged the new graduates of this predominantly black
institution in northeast Louisiana to do their best.
   ``You have been living in a never-never land,'' she said. ``You

   Actor James Garner has been released from
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one week after surgery to correct a
weakness in the main artery carrying blood to his heart.
   ``He made a spectacular recovery _ we had thought he might be in
for two weeks ... but today he walked out after just a week,''
hospital spokesman Ron Wise said following the actor's release
Friday.
   The 60-year-old former star of ``Maverick'' and ``The Rockford
Files'' was scheduled to have the operation three months ago but
doctors decided he first had to undergo quintuple heart bypass
surgery.
   Garner, who won an Emmy for ``Rockford,'' recently appeared with
Bruce Willis in the film ``Sunset.''

   Joe DiMaggio, the Hall of Fame New York
Yankee centerfielder, was in ``excellent'' condition and in high
spirits following successful surgery to repair an abdominal aortic
aneurysm, his doctor said.
   The 74-year-old baseball great also was buoyed by a telegram
from President and Nancy Reagan, his cardiologist Dr. Philip Samet
said Friday. DiMaggio entered the hospital Monday and went into
surgery Thursday.
   ``He's doing great. He's making excellent progress from surgery
and will be moved out of the surgical intensive care unit sometime
over the weekend,'' said Lori Fagenholz, a Mount Sinai Medical
Center spokeswoman.
   ``Joe is getting inundated by flowers, cards and telephone
calls,'' she said.
   DiMaggio, who had a pacemaker implanted in 1987, elected to have
the aneurysm repaired after it suddenly showed signs of growth. An
aneurysm is a weakening of an artery wall that permits it to
balloon out. It can be fatal if it ruptures, Ms. Fagenholz said.

   Michael J. Fox, who plays the smart aleck
Alex Keaton on NBC's ``Family Ties,'' plans to tie the knot with
actress Tracy Pollan, his former girlfriend on the show, according
to the actor's agent.
   An assistant to Fox's agent Peter Benedek said Friday that Fox
was getting married but he wouldn't disclose where or when.
   However, a source close to the actor said Fox would ``be married
by Sunday night.'' Another source said the wedding would take place
in a country inn, probably in Vermont, where Fox owns a 100-acre
homestead.
   Both sources demanded anonymity.
   Ms. Pollan, 27, played the girlfriend of Fox's character on the
popular sitcom before going on to film roles.
   Fox, 26, started dating Ms. Pollan last spring after her
break-up with actor Kevin Bacon, People magazine reported in May.
The couple also co-starred in the film ``Bright Lights, Big City.''

<TEXT>
   A Marine Corps major who lost a lung
when he was wounded in Vietnam gave up a grueling run Friday from
the lowest point in North America to the highest mountaintop in the
continental United States.
   Hallucinating, suffering from cramps and dehydration, and
showing a temperature of 101.6 degrees, Maj. John Bates quit the
run on the flank of Mount Whitney that he had begun in Death Valley
on Wednesday night.
   Bates, 42, said he was ``done in'' by a steep 11-mile grade and
temperatures of more than 100 degrees Friday, the Los Angeles Times
reported.
   ``I tried to climb into a bush thinking it was my wife's car,''
he said, managing a weary smile. ``I was also violently
regurgitating anything I ate.''
   Bates left Badwater, Calif., at 282 feet below sea level, at 8
p.m. Wednesday. His goal was to beat the existng record to the
summit of Mount Whitney, at 14,464 feet, some 146 miles away.
   The run's fastest recorded time is 45 hours, 15 minutes, set by
Gil Cornell of Lone Pine in 1987.
   Bates previously ran the course in September 1986, posting his
personal best time of 63 hours, with two eight-hour sleep breaks
during that run.
   ``He picked one of the toughest terrains in the world at a real
bad time of the year,'' said Russell Marsh, acting chief ranger at
Death Valley National Monument.
   ``We are talking about an average temperature of 120 degrees and
a ground-floor temperature of 200 degrees.''
   Bates 36-year-old wife, Stephanie, who was accompanying the
Marine in a camper said she found that her husband's temperature
was 101.6 degrees.
   Over his objections, she said, ``I decided to drive him into
Lone Pine.
   ``He said, `No, just let me rest a little longer.'
   ``I said, `Try to fight me.' I knew he could not.''
   Bates lost a lung when a Viet Cong bullet hit his chest Dec. 17,
1966. During the war, he also caught grenade shrapnel in his left
knee and lost all feeling in two toes after stepping on a trap.
   Bates, who is en route to his next assignment at the Marine
Corps Air Station at Kanehoe, Hawaii, said he was making the run
for personal satisfaction.
   ``It also gives publicity to the Marine Corps and disabled
Vietnam veterans by showing there is a lot more they can do with
their lives,'' he said.

   Anglican bishops representing 70
million faithful worldwide face bitter divisions over ordination of
women as priests and bishops when they open an international
conference this weekend.
   ``The omens are not good for the 12th Lambeth Conference.
Inevitably it will be dominated by questions about women priests
and women bishops,'' said an editorial in the Church of England
independent weekly, Church Times.
   ``It seems that bishops advocating and bishops resisting the
ordination of women are on a collision course,'' the weekly said.
   The three-week meeting of the Lambeth Conference, held every 10
years, officially opens on Sunday with a service in Canterbury
Cathedral and closes with another there on Sunday, Aug. 7.
   Anglicans are the world's largest group of Christians after the
estimated 700 million Roman Catholics.
   The conference, which will discuss the work of the church,
relations with other Christians and social questions, has been
overshadowed by the controversy over women priests, already
ordained in some of the Anglican Communion's 27 provinces but
rejected in others.
   Even more divisive is the possibility that Anglicans in the U.S.
Episcopal Church will consecrate their first woman bishop this year.
   Bishops in many provinces have said that while they might
tolerate women priests, the prospect of a woman bishop could lead
to severing of ties between their churches and the Anglican
Communion.
   Each province is self-governing, unlike the Catholic Church,
which is ruled centrally by the pope in the Vatican. But the state
Church of England is looked to for guidance, and its spiritual
head, Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, is the world Anglican
leader.
   Last week, the policy-making General Synod of the Church of
England voted to proceed with draft legislation to admit women to
the priesthood, rejecting Runcie's advice not to do so because it
might split the church. England could have its first woman priest
by 1993 if Parliament agrees.
   Runcie warned that women's ordination could be an added
hindrance to unity with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches,
which have all-male priesthoods.
   The draft rules propose compensating clergymen with payments up
to about $50,000 if they quit the church because they feel they
cannot work with women priests.
   England's Movement for the Ordination of Women says that about
1,000 women have been ordained, most of them in the United States,
Canada and New Zealand. Opponents say the true figure is about 700.
   Churchmen opposed to women priests on grounds of scripture and
tradition say while they might eventually accept them, they would
never accept a woman bishop because bishops are followers of the
apostles of Jesus Christ, founder of Christianity, who were all men.
   Runcie has warned that because some bishops would not tolerate
women bishops, the Anglican Communion might divide into a
federation of loosely linked regional churches, each with its own
conference to replace the Lambeth Conference.
   ``We have lost members because of the ordination of women, and
we still have members who are distressed about it,'' said
Memphis-based U.S. Episcopalian Bishop Alex Dickson of the Diocese
of West Tennessee, when he arrived in Canterbury.
   ``I am concerned that we remain sensitive to people who oppose
women's ordination and that we make room for them.''
   The first Lambeth Conference was held in 1867 and attended by 76
bishops, at Lambeth Palace, official London residence of the
archbishop of Canterbury.
   Runcie has personally invited each of the 577 bishops to the
12th Lambeth Conference. About 380 of them have said they will
bring their wives, who will hold their own conference.

   A flag-waving union rally
degenerated into a car smashing Friday as union workers protested
wages paid by a Japanese company and other builders of a hotel and
convention complex at Walt Disney World.
   Union protesters, incensed about wages paid to construction
workers building on Disney property, pulled down 300 feet of a
construction fence when the rally turned violent.
   About 50 surged onto the Swan and Dolphin hotel property and
used sledgehammers, ax handles and their feet to demolish a
security guard's Toyota. Tires were slashed on another vehicle.
   The rally, which drew about 400 union members, got off to a
peaceful start as state AFL-CIO President Dan Miller charged that
for the first time in 20 years, contractors building on Disney
property weren't paying wages set in a union agreement.
   Miller focused much of his anger at Aoki Corp. of Tokyo, which
along with two partners is building the complex on Disney land. He
said builders are paying workers $2 to $4 an hour less that the $8
rate cited in union construction contracts.
   The Toyota was demolished, and the unruly crowd dispersed
quickly when there were shouts that the police were coming. No
arrests were made.
   One protester who remained, union bricklayer John Brady, said:
``Violence is not the way, but our people are frustrated. They see
foreign companies coming in to take American jobs. They feel that
they're being sold down the river.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union and China criticized the
United States for downing an Iranian airliner over the Persian
Gulf, but the Security Council is likely to consider a compromise
that distributes the blame.
   Iran failed to get Security Council members to condemn the
United States Friday for the July 3 attack that left 290 people
dead, and most nations said the urgent priority is to end the
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The Soviet Union said the U.S. Navy must withdraw from the gulf
in favor of a U.N. peacekeeping force.
   ``This tragedy has demonstrated once again that the U.S. naval
fleet must leave the gulf without delay,''said Valentine V.
Lozinskiy, the deputy Soviet representative.
   Iran had asked for the Security Council meeting on the shooting
down of the Airbus A300 by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes. The
15-nation Security Council adjourned the matter until Monday after
debating the gulf disaster for a second day on Friday.
   The council president for July, Ambassador Paulo
Nogueria-Batista of Brazil, is trying to draft a document that
would be acceptable to everyone and save face for Iran.
   Iran's presence at the meeting was its first appearance at the
council, which it has boycotted since the beginning of the
Iran-Iraq war in 1980.
   Diplomatic sources said council members feel Iran must achieve
something at the meeting or it will continue boycotting the council
and continue rejecting a year-old Security Council resolution that
demands an immediate cease-fire.
   On Thursday, Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati of Iran
condemned the United States before the council, and Vice President
George Bush said the Vincennes acted in self defense when fired on
the airliner.
   Pentagon officials said the cruiser's officers thought the
Airbus A300 was an Iranian F-14 on an attack course.
   Thirteen nations spoke Friday, including Britain, China, France,
Italy, Japan, West Germany, Yugoslavia, Algeria and Argentina.
   At a news conference Friday, Velayati said: ``The attitude of
the U.S. administration is similar to a rich man's son who drives
when he's drunk. He thinks money can buy everything, and that is
not true.''
   The Soviet speech, like others, was moderate, and Moscow sent
only its second-ranking delegate to the debate.
   In 1983, the Soviet Union vetoed a Security Council resolution
condemning it for shooting down a South Korean airliner over its
territory. That disaster killed 269 people.
   All speakers Friday deplored the tragedy, but also said that the
most important task is to end the war through implementation of
U.N. Resolution 598, which calls for a truce, withdrawal to
recognized borders, prisoner exchange and an investigation of who
was responsible for the war.
   Iraq has said it will accept the resolution if Iran does, but
the Iranians insist that Iraq be branded the aggressor before a
truce. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after several border
skirmishes.
   John Birch, deputy British representative, defended a nation's
right to have its warships defend its shipping in international
waters.
   If the Security Council's demand for a cease-fire had been met,
Birch said, ``we should not be considering here today another
horror born of this senseless conflict.''
   Pierre Brochand, the French deputy representative, said the
international community ``cannot pass judgment on such a tragic
error without the results of an inquiry. We should take into
account the conditions prevailing in the region ... fraught with
insecurity because of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Chinese ambassador Li Luye said the United States was
responsible and ``the question of responsibility should not be
ignored if repetition of such a tragedy is to be avoided.''
   He also opposed ``big-power military involvement in the gulf
region because it only further complicates the situation and may
further exacerbate the conflict.''
   ``We appeal to Iran and Iraq to cooperate in ernest with the
secretary-general and the council in good faith on the basis of
598,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese magazine says the U.S. Navy's
missile attack on an Iranian jetliner derailed hostage talks
between the United States and Iran.
   Ash-Shiraa said Friday that talks between negotiatiors for the
two countries had been held in a European country and ``covered
many details.''
   The report said ``a number of American hostages were to be
released in south Beirut in return for a public change in the
American political stand on the Gulf War in favor of Iran.''
   It said the talks in Europe broke down after the Navy shot down
the Iran Air jetliner July 3, killing all 290 people on board. The
United States said its forces mistook the plane for a jet fighter.
   The report carried no further details of the alleged talks and
cited no sources.
   Ash-Shiraa gained international fame in 1986 when it broke the
story of secret U.S. arms sales to Iran to win release of American
hostages. But the magazine's recent reports on the 18 foreign
captives held in Lebanon have not been accurate.
   In a separate report, the magazine said members of a West German
delegation held talks in Christian east Beirut with representatives
of a pro-Iranian group holding West German hostage Rudolf Cordes.
   ``The German delegation has returned home after the talks
reached a dead end,'' the report said. The magazine did not report
the cause of the impasse.
   Cordes, 53, a businessman with Hoechst AG, a West German
chemical firm, was kidnapped Jan. 17, 1987 in Moslem west Beirut.
The pro-Iranian Holy Warriors for Freedom claimed responsibility
for his abduction.
   Nine Americans are among the foreign captives in Lebanon. The
longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Quotes From the Presidential Campaign Trail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some comments from the presidential
campaign trail:
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, ruling out Jesse Jackson's notion to have
former President Jimmy Carter play play peacemaker in their
pre-convention disagreements: ``We don't need mediators.''
   
   JIMMY CARTER, saying he thinks Dukakis and Jackson can work out
their differences on their own, without his help: ``I don't think
they need any mediation. I think what is needed is to just have a
better means of communication between one another.''
   
   WALTER MONDALE, former Democratic presidential candidate,
warning against heightened tensions between Dukakis and Jackson:
``We always have rising tensions about this time; it's inherent.
... But I believe this is a year where Democrats understand these
fights, if they're carried on too far, become too personalized,
they set poison down into the roots that can be difficult to deal
with.''
   
   JESSE JACKSON, preaching accommodation rather than discord: ``We
simply cannot win without each other. We can only win with each
other. It is in our distinct advantage to find common ground.''
   
   BOB DOLE, saying the wide gap that exists between the outlook of
Dukakis and his vice presidential running mate will not occur on
the Republican ticket: ``You're going to find only shades of
difference in our philosophy, not this chasm you find between
Dukakis on the one hand and Lloyd Bentsen on the other.''

   Los Angeles drug gangs are spreading
cocaine and violence in cities nationwide and may become a new form
of organized crime unless they are stopped soon, the Los Angeles
County district attorney warns.
   ``This isn't organized crime as we understand that today. But I
think it's the genesis of a new form of organized crime involved in
drug trafficking,'' District Attorney Ira Reiner said Friday.
   ``If we don't stamp it out throughout the country now, while it
is still manageable, we can come back 10 years from now and talk
about the full-blown problem of organized crime, because that is
what it will be,'' he said.
   Reiner was among about 50 law officers from 11 Midwest and
Western cities who attended a two-day conference to develop a
national strategy to fight the spread of Los Angeles drug gangs.
   Members of 25 Los Angeles street gang ``sets'' or factions have
been reported dealing drugs in more than 45 cities, authorities
said.
   The gangs are spreading to medium-sized cities because of
increased pressure from police in Southern California and declining
drug prices in that area, where cocaine is abundant.
   ``It's fair to say that these gangs are trying to take over the
retail distribution of cocaine in many parts of the country,'' said
Frank Storey, agent in charge of the Kansas City FBI office.
``Their major objective is to open up new markets and increase
revenue in their operations.''
   Authorities say members of two prominent rival drug gangs from
Los Angeles, the Crips and the Bloods, have infiltrated cities from
Alaska to Washington, D.C., selling cocaine and its powerful
derivative, crack.
   Last year, 387 people died in gang-related violence in Los
Angeles, about half of them innocent bystanders. More than 110
people have died in the city so far this year, including a San
Diego State University student who police say was gunned down for
wearing a red shirt. Red is the color of the Bloods, and the Crips
wear blue-colored clothing.
   Participants in the seminar discussed development of a national
computerized data bank to keep track of the movements of
gang-related drug dealers, Storey said.
   Larry Kramer, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department,
said authorities also agreed to try prosecuting gang members on
federal charges more often.
   ``The federal penalties are enhanced and much more severe,''
Kramer said. ``There is, quite frankly, much more certainty of a
protracted penalty through the federal system. ... I think you'll
see more prosecutions federally.''
   Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Charles Brantley, who directs a
gang-fighting force known as Operation Safe Streets, said he
advised fellow law officers to act quickly to crack down on Los
Angeles drug-gang members infiltrating their communities.
   ``Of course, everyone knows that in Los Angeles we've reached
the point where we're really fighting a hard battle,'' Brantley
said. ``But in some of these cities that only have 50 or 60 gang
members, now's the time to stop it. Get in there and take care of
it. Get the support of city councils, the courts, the district
attorneys and stop it now before it gets bad.''

<HEAD>US, Vietnam Agree On Resettling Political Prisoners</HEAD>

   Vietnam could begin allowing political
prisoners to emigrate to the United States in the next several
months, Vietnam's official news agency said today.
   The Vietnam News Agency quoted a statement by U.S. and
Vietnamese negotiators as saying that the two nations reached
preliminary agreement on releasing prisoners from so-called
``re-education'' camps.
   The joint statement said that while further talks are needed,
``both sides are hopeful that the processing of released detainees
can begin within the next several months,'' the news agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Bangkok, said the statement was issued
Friday after two days of talks in Hanoi between teams led by
Vietnam's deputy foreign minister, Tran Quang Co, and Robert L.
Funseth, U.S. senior deputy assistant secretary of state for
refugee programs.
   The statement said Funseth reaffirmed President Reagan's 1984
commitment to welcome for resettlement former detainees and their
families who had close ties with the United States or its ally, the
South Vietnamese government.
   Co in turn reaffirmed Vietnam's policy to let these people
emigrate, it said.
   Vietnam had demanded that the United States guarantee that the
former prisoners would not be allowed to conduct anti-Vietnamese
activities once they were resettled. Vietnam has accused U.S.
authorities of helping Vietnamese emigres seeking to overthrow the
communist government.
   The Vietnamese side reaffirmed that Vietnam will not encourage
them to engage in anti-U.S. activities, the news agency said.
   The United States ended its combat role in the Vietnam War in
1973. In 1975, South Vietnam fell to the communist forces of North
Vietnam and the two Vietnams were reunited under a communist
government.
   The statement said the U.S. team ``declared that the released
re-education center detainees coming to the United States would be
subject to all U.S. laws, including those affecting the activities
of U.S. residents toward other countries.''
   The joint statement said the two sides discussed ways of
speeding the processing of applications of former prisoners. A
limited number of former prisoners have gone to the United States
through the United Nations-sponsored Orderly Departure Program,
under which Vietnamese refugees and migrants leave their homeland
on regular flights.
   The North Vietnamese communists established the huge network of
re-education camps, which usually combined manual labor with
ideological study, after defeating South Vietnam in April 1975.
   The U.S. State Department estimates that about 900,000 former
U.S. government employees or South Vietnamese officials have spent
time in the camps, which the human rights group Amnesty
International has condemned but Vietnam has called lenient
punishment for ``war criminals.''
   The United States renewed it interest in the prisoners after
Nguyen Van Linh, the pragmatic Communist Party chief, urged
national reconciliation and freed hundreds of former South
Vietnamese officials in September 1987 and February this year.
   Vice Minister of Information Phan Quang said on Feb. 11 that
only 150 former officials remained held.

   Contra rebels violating a truce with
the Sandinista government attacked three times in northern and
central Nicaragua, and one civilian and three rebels were killed,
the Defense Ministry said.
   The statement Friday said nothing of any government casualties.
The U.S.-backed rebels and the leftist government have accused each
other of truce violations on and off since the cease-fire began
March 21.
   The ministry said that in one of the attacks on Thursday, three
Contras died in a shootout with an army patrol in northern
Matagalpa province.
   It also said the Contras ambushed an army truck in northern
Jinotega province, kidnapping 16 people on board, and that four
other people were abducted by the rebels and a civilian was killed
in central Chontales province.
   The Sandinistas celebrate nine years in power next Tuesday. The
insurrection they led in July 1979 ended 42 years of rule by the
rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty.
   Representatives from both sides have held meetings to try to
reach a peace accord without success. The last round of talks in
June ended in deadlock and no new meetings were scheduled.
   The army announced on Friday a series of military exercises to
defend Managua, the capital, in case of attack. The Sandinistas
have long claimed the United States eventually plans to invade
Nicaragua.
   On Monday, the Sandinistas expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard
Melton and seven other U.S. diplomats, accusing them of conspiring
to undermine the government.
   The Interior Ministry announced Friday night the suspension of
the radio program ``El Despertar'' (The Awakening) for
``transmitting false information.'' The statement, read over
state-run radio, did not say how long the suspension would be in
effect.
   Last week the government closed down the Roman Catholic Church's
Radio Catolica; suspended publication for 15 days of the only
opposition newspaper, La Prensa, and this week expropriated Ingenio
San Antonio, the country's leading sugar refinery.
   Business leaders called the takeover of the company, belonging
to the wealthy Pellas family, a setback for private enterprise.
   Washington reacted to the expulsion of U.S. diplomats by
ordering out Nicaraguan Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann and seven
embassy colleagues.
   Tunnermann reluctantly bowed to the order and departed on
Friday, five minutes ahead of the deadline imposed by the State
Department.
   In Managua, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto issued a statement
saying Tunnermann would remain as Nicaragua's ambassador to the
Organization of American States in Washington ``until this
controversy can be elucidated.''
   The statement reiterated Nicaragua's position that as OAS
ambassador, Tunnermann cannot be barred from Washington despite his
expulsion as ambassador to the United States.
   Nicaragua called on the InterAmerican Legal Committee to resolve
the dispute.

   Rejecting Jackie Presser's choice of an heir,
the Teamsters are returning power to one of its veteran ``old
guard'' East Coast leaders at a time when the union is under siege
both from without and within.
   The Teamsters' 17-member executive board on Friday elected
William J. McCarthy, 69, of Boston to succeed the late Presser as
president of the 1.6-million-member union.
   McCarthy, who has headed the Teamsters' operations in New
England for the past two decades, beat out Secretary-Treasurer
Weldon Mathis, 62, of Atlanta, by a 9-8 vote, said several sources.
   Presser, who died a week ago after being incapacitated most of
the past 18 months with cancer, had named Mathis in 1985 to the
union's No. 2 post and appointed him interim president in May, just
before Presser was to undergo brain surgery.
   The struggle for the top post was the most contentious, and most
open, in the union's 85-year history.
   Behind McCarthy's successful challenge was veteran Teamster
power broker Joseph Trerotola of New York, at 70 the union's
longest-standing vice president and head of its 15-state Eastern
Conference since 1969.
   ``The Presser forces lined up behind Mathis and the Trerotola
forces lined up with McCarthy,'' said one source, who, like the
others, would talk about the wrangling for power only on the
condition of anonymity.
   Mathis remains the union's secretary-treasurer.
   The turnover at the top of the nation's largest union occurs
just two weeks after the Justice Department filed suit to seize
control of its affairs, claiming the entire Teamsters leadership
has been corrupted by organized crime figures.
   McCarthy's election also reflects wide-scale disenchantment with
the recently negotiated National Master Freight Agreement, the
union's biggest contract covering 200,000 Teamsters in the
interstate trucking industry.
   The three-year accord negotiated under Mathis' leadership during
Presser's absence was rejected by 64 percent of the rank-and-file
members casting ballots in a ratification vote last spring.
   However, under the Teamsters' constitution, it takes a
two-thirds membership vote to nullify an accord once it is
initialed by the union's negotiators.
   McCarthy, breaking from past Teamster traditions to keep
disputes within the union's hierarchy behind closed doors, actively
campaigned against the freight accord.
   Upon his election Friday, he indicated he will try to reopen the
trucking industry contract for new negotiations.
   ``I don't know what I can do but I plan to do everything I can
to improve on it and get the wishes of our membership,'' he said.
   McCarthy has presided over the 8,000-member Teamsters Local 25
the Charlestown section of Boston for 33 years and headed the
international union's operations in New England for two decades.
   Asked by a reporter Friday what Presser would have thought about
his election, McCarthy confirmed his reputation among leaders of
other labor unions as being a tough bargainer _ and possessing a
quick temper.
   ``Who knows? Maybe he would roll over in his grave,'' he
replied. ``I don't know what he was thinking. Why don't you try to
locate him. That's a goofy question, I'll give you a goofy answer.''
   McCarthy declined to elaborate on the power struggle with Mathis.
   ``The great strength of this board is that we will argue and
fight about an issue but when the majority vote is taken, everyone
stands behind the decision,'' he said.
   However, at least two union board members objected to declaring
the vote for McCarthy unanimous, a Teamster tradition when the
mantle is passed from one president to another, one source said.
   Both McCarthy and Mathis are viewed by leaders of other unions
as being ``clean'' _ with no major ties to organized crime figures
in contrast to the ties that the government alleges that Presser
and former Teamster presidents Roy Williams and Jimmy Hoffa had.
   Other than being listed as a defendant like all of the Teamster
vice presidents in the federal suit to take over the union,
McCarthy's name surfaced only once in the 200 pages of documents
the government filed two weeks ago to support its takeover case.
   In a transcript of an FBI-wiretapped conversation on May 9,
1984, convicted New York crime boss Anthony Salerno is quoted as
recognizing McCarthy's name as the Teamsters' ``head boss of the
East Coast.''
   Salerno was quoted as saying in the tapped telephone
conversation with John Tronolone, a reputed Cleveland organized
crime figure, that McCarthy is ``very friendly'' with a man that
Salerno identified only as Cass.
   In view of the government's unprecedented attempt to take over
the entire union, McCarthy said Friday he has a ``tough job ahead.''
   ``It should be condolences, not congratulations,'' he said.

   Nicaraguan rebels,
shaken by U.S. aid reductions and dissidents demanding more
democracy within the Contra movement, are seeking to reorganize the
Nicaraguan Resistance.
   Leaders of the Contras from Miami, Venezuela, Costa Rica and
other points will meet in the Concorde Hotel on Sunday and Monday
to resolve issues that threaten to split the rebels fighting the
leftist Sandinista government.
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Danilo Valle said his government was
disturbed that the Dominican government would allow ``groups and
people who not more than two days ago threatened to commit
terrorist acts and assassination attempts against Sandinista
government leaders to come here to organize themselves.''
   Dominican Foreign Minister Favio Herrera said the meeting would
be a ``private affair'' and the government would not permit the
Contra leaders ``to issue extemporaneous declarations beyond those
strictly related to the private character of the meeting that might
affect the cordial relationship maintained with the Nicaraguan
government.''
   The Nicaraguan Resistance groups several different
anti-Sandinista forces following the dissolution of the umbrella
organization National Union of Opposition over a year ago.
   Adolfo Calero heads the conservatives, Azucena Ferrey the
Christian Democrats, Adolfo Robledo the Social Democrats, Aristides
Sanchez the liberals, and Alfredo Salazar the southern opposition.
Col. Enrique Bermudez heads the labor, agrarian and business
sectors as well as the Miskito Indians, and Pedro Joaquin Chamorro
represents the ``independent'' sector.
   According to the organization's by-laws, each group can send
seven delegates to the meeting.
   The five members of the organization's directorate are expected
to be either replaced or ratified in their positions.
   The five are Calero, Salazar, Ferrey, Sanchez and Chamorro.
   Dissident Contra commanders, backed by Calero and Chamorro, have
demanded the removal of Bermudez as military chief. They accuse the
former National Guard colonel of being inefficient, corrupt and too
close to supporters of Anastasio Somoza, the right-wing dictator
ousted by the Sandinistas in 1979.
   The dissidents have been booted out of Honduras and lost their
commands. Since then Calero and Chamorro have rarely been seen with
Sanchez, Cesar and Ferrey.
   The possibility of renewed aid surfaced Thursday after the
Sandinistas violently broke up a non-violent demonstration in
Managua, closed a Catholic radio station and the opposition
newspaper La Prensa, arrested 40 opposition leaders and expelled
U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton.
   In a show of bipartisan unity, the U.S. Senate approved Thursday
a non-binding resolution warning Nicaragua's government that
military aid to the Contras could resume unless it reverses what it
described as ``dramatic new steps in brutality'' against its own
citizens.
   In what some senators called a ``carrot and stick policy,''
adopted on a 91-4 vote, the Senate also said it was ready to extend
U.S. economic aid to Nicaragua if the Sandinistas fully comply with
commitments made a year ago and ``proceed to permit the
establishment of a democratic system.''
   The Contras normally once had six directors. One of the seats
has been empty since Alfonso Robelo quit and moved permanently to
Central America.
   Sources speaking on condition of anonymity say Calero, whose
brother Mario was just indicted in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. for
illegally supplying mercenaries to the Contras, may also resign or
be voted out of his post, and it is possible Chamorro would go with
him.
   The dissidents have proposed as a compromise that Bermudez be
bumped up to the empty director's seat, getting him out of the
military command without humiliating him, but the directors have
never endorsed that idea.

<TEXT>
   Soviet and Chinese pressure on North
Korea will help prevent terrorist attacks on the 1988 Olympics,
U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said today.
   ``I think everybody will be exerting their influence in a
positive way. I feel that the Olympics will go off in good style,''
he told newsmen shortly before landing in the South Korean capital
en route from Beijing.
   He said the South Koreans were also ``doing such a fine job in
putting into place all the measures that deter any kinds of
disturbances.''
   But on the eve of Shultz's arrival, the United Nations Command
accused North Korea of trying to undermine the games.
   ``Your attempts to contrive an atmosphere of danger on the
Korean peninsula, in a transparent attempt to undermine the
upcoming Seoul Olympics, will not succeed,'' said U.S. Rear Adm.
William T. Pendley, chief UNC delegate to the Military Armistice
Commission.
   Arriving for his seventh stop on a nine-country Asian and
Pacific visit, Shultz was driven straight from the airport to the
Olympic Village and Olympic Park.
   He toured the living quarters at the Olympic Village, which will
house up to 15,000 athletes and officials during the Sept. 17 to
Oct. 2 event. He also was driven through one of two major sports
complexes studded with futuristic stadiums and outdoor sculptures.
   The electronic scoreboard flashed a welcome message when Shultz
and his party entered the main, 10,000-seat swimming stadium.
   Olympic security is one of the key issues Shultz is expected to
discuss when he meets President Roh Tae-woo, Foreign Minister Choi
Kwang-soo and other South Korean government and opposition leaders.
   Also scheduled for discussion are South Korea's recent
initiatives at reconciliation with North Korea, U.S.-Korean trade
problems and America's continuing military role in South Korea.
   He called President Roh's recent proposal to ease tensions with
North Korea as ``a very important step.
   ``It's too bad the North Koreans brushed it off. It may well be
that they will take a second look,'' Shultz told reporters.
   He said the United States would have to carefully assess North
Korean actions in light of Seoul's initiatives. Shultz said
U.S.-North Korean relations had been moving in a positive direction
until the destruction of a South Korean passenger airliner Nov. 29
near Burma, with the deaths of all 115 people aboard.
   North Korea denied all involvement in the alleged bombing.
   In remarks to reporters before arriving in Seoul, Shultz said
that in preparing for the Olympiad the South Koreans were alert to
the placement of surface-to-air missiles within range of Seoul and
the recent introduction of an advanced Soviet warplane in North
Korea.
   The Soviet Union, according to Washington, last year provided
North Korea with SAM-5 missiles and more recently a small number of
advanced MIG-29 jets.
   But Shultz also stressed that Moscow has ``flatly'' said the
North Koreans would not interfere with the Olympic Games, which
they are boycotting after failing to become co-hosts of the event.
   Shultz said he had received similar assurances from the Chinese,
who like the Soviets, will be competing in the Olympics.
   During his trip to Seoul, Shultz may run into some criticism in
discussing U.S.-South Korean trade relations.
   The United States has urged economically booming South Korea to
liberalize its regulations on some U.S.imports to offset a trade
deficit running at about $10 billion.

<HEAD>From Forks To Frying Pans, Chicago Murder Weapons Run The Gamut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From forks to frying pans, the diversity of
weapons wielded by the city's murderers could fill dozens of Agatha
Christie mystery books.
   The weapon of choice in Chicago for doing in a neighbor,
relative or worst enemy remains the firearm, says the 1987 Murder
Analysis Report, a compendium of statistics about murder in the
Windy City compiled by the police department.
   But last year, people in Chicago were killed with an almost
A-to-Z arsenal of weapons, from an ashtray in one case to wooden
boards in five slayings, the report shows.
   One person was murdered with an axe, another was killed with an
electric fan and a third was apparently burned to death with hot
grease, says the report, which lists the type of weapon and the
number of cases in which it was used without elaborating on the
circumstances.
   ``They say necessity is the mother of invention,'' said Chicago
police Officer Patrick Camden of the department's news affairs
office. ``People grab whatever's handy, I guess.''
   That's usually the case, says Stuart Kaminsky, who is something
of an expert on the art of murder as the author of 21 murder
mysteries.
   ``It sounds like these might be exotic murders, done by some
fiendishly clever criminal,'' says Kaminsky, who lives in suburban
Evanston and has written such mysteries as the Toby Peters and
Inspector Rostnikov series.
   ``But it seems to me that in most of these cases, when exotic
weapons were used, they were probably domestic cases where people
grabbed what was handy when the emotions of the moment took over,''
he said in a telephone interview Friday night.
   Camden noted that the report, though depicting a diversity of
dastardly deeds, contains some good news: the number of homicides
in Chicago dropped from 744 in 1986 to 691 in 1987.
   In the nation's third-largest city, 374 people were killed last
year with firearms, 175 were killed by cutting or slashing
implements and 142 lives were ended with other weapons, the report
found.
   The most widely used firearm was the .38-caliber revolver,
employed in 126 shooting deaths, the report said. Murderers used
semi-automatic pistols to kill 76 people and shotguns to blast away
20 others.
   Under the cutting and slashing category, one person was murdered
with a bayonet, one with a saber and one with a screwdriver. Two
people died at the hands of fork-wielding killers, three were
stabbed to death with a carving knife and two with a boning knife.
   A simple kitchen knife was the most-used weapon in this
category, involved in 88 murders, followed by a pocket knife, used
in 29 slayings, the report said.
   In the ``other'' category, 10 people were beaten to death with
baseball bats, one with a hammer, three with bricks, one with a
rake and another with a shovel. Most beating deaths _ 54 _ were
committed with the most accessible weapons: the hands, fists or
feet, the report shows.
   The report notes that matches were used in two killings, but
Camden says in those cases a lighted match was tossed on a person
soaked with gasoline.
   ``While these appear to be creative, I think truly creative
killers are rare,'' Kaminsky said. ``I think the more clever the
killer the less likely he is to use an exotic weapon because that
draws more attention, making it more likely the person will get
caught.''

   Three white lawmen accused of beating to
death a black jail inmate arrested for drunken driving have been
acquitted on charges they violated his civil rights, but face a new
trial on murder charges.
   The state district court jury's verdicts Friday drew angry
reactions from the black community in this East Texas town.
   ``If there's justice for all in a free society, then it seems
like there's justice for whites only in this society,'' said Will
Smith, a preacher from the Church of Christ. ``The message is to me
that as black folks, we better be careful.''
   Suspended Hemphill Police Chief Thomas Ladner, 41, and Sabine
County deputies James ``Bo'' Hyde, 35, and Bill Horton, 58, were
charged in the death of Loyal Garner Jr., a truck driver who was
jailed in Hemphill Christmas night.
   The three now face murder charges in Tyler, about 65 miles
northwest of here, where Garner died in a hospital two days after
he was jailed. Defense attorney Paul Buchanan said he would file
pretrial motions today contending the upcoming trial places the men
in double jeopardy. That trial is to begin Monday.
   In February, an inquest jury in Tyler ruled that Garner died of
head injuries. A pathologist had testified that Garner suffered
severe brain hemorrhaging after apparently being struck on the head
at least twice.
   Corrine Garner, the victim's wife, said she was disappointed by
the verdicts, handed down after 11 hours of deliberations by a jury
that included a black woman.
   ``I guess we'll have to go to Tyler,'' she said, referring to
the murder charges.
   Garner's mother, Sarah, said, ``I'm not worried. It's not what
I'm going to get, I turn it over to God. It's what God's going to
get. I'm going to keep on hoping.''
   Conviction by the district court jury of violating Garner's
civil rights could have meant a maximum life sentence for each of
the lawmen.
   ``It was the right result,'' said John Seale, Ladner's attorney.
``This was the most hard-fought case I've ever been involved in.''
   The lawmen refused to talk to reporters Friday, as did the
jurors.
   Special prosecutor John Hannah said he would take the case to
the U.S. Justice Department and urge them to file indictments of
conspiracy to violate Garner's civil rights.
   ``This could sound like sour grapes from the losing side, but I
do have a right to seek justice elsewhere. The results were
unfair,'' Hannah said.
   Garner, 34, of Florien, La., and two others were arrested on
suspicion of drunken driving Christmas night just outside Hemphill.
He allegedly was beaten unconscious that night in the county jail.
   The lawmen took the stand during the two-week trial and denied
they struck the fatal blows.
   Prosecutors relied on testimony by Alton Maxie, who was arrested
and jailed along with his brother Johnnie Maxie and Garner, that
Ladner hit Garner with a night stick on the head at least four
times.
   ``When Ladner hit him, Loyal put his hand over his head,'' Alton
Maxie testified. ``Ladner caught him around the neck and pushed him
out the door ... I heard Loyal say, `I just wanted to call my
wife.' They brought him back in and sat him up and just let him
slide down the wall.''
   Ladner acknowledged hitting Garner once, but said it was a
glancing blow because Garner threw up his arms to defend himself.
The chief said he did not know how Garner received blows to both
sides and the top of his head.
   Horton said Garner was asked if he needed medical attention.
   ``He said he didn't want to go anywhere with us, or something
like that,'' Horton testified.
   Maxie said he heard more beating sounds after the officers took
Garner out of the jail's drunk tank.

<HEAD>Study: Feds Fail to Aggressively Prosecute Safety Violators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government has successfully
prosecuted only two cases of workplace safety violations over the
past eight years despite tens of thousands of deaths on the job
every year, a new study says.
   ``There are at least 100 good criminal cases every year where
deaths have occurred and where employers knowingly and willfully
violated federal regulations,'' said Joseph Kinney, executive
director of The National Safe Workplace Institute, a year-old
non-profit group in Chicago that conducted the study.
   An estimated 60,700 workers die on the job each year, the
institute said.
   While the U.S. Justice Department has had only two successful
prosecutions since 1980, California successfully prosecuted 112
cases in that time under that state's operation of a federally
funded safety program, the institute found. California has since
dropped its program, and supporters are seeking its reinstatement.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten defended the federal
system.
   ``When we get a (criminal) case that has prosecutorial merit, we
prosecute it,'' he said Friday.
   ``It is often more appropriate to file and to prosecute such
cases in state court, where you have a wider variety of laws that
apply.''
   Kinney said 50,000 of the estimated 60,700 workplace deaths each
year were from disease, most often cancer.
   ``But there are 10,000 traumatic deaths each year ... and
another 1.8 million injuries, and 60,000 or those result in
permanent disability,'' he added.
   ``People think of these kinds of things as being part of our
(labor) past,'' Kinney said, ``but this is our present.''
   The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
empowered to seek criminal sanctions against employers in 28 states
who violate workplace safety standards. That agency also is charged
with monitoring programs in the remaining 22 states, which choose
to operate federally funded workplace-safety programs themselves.
   California stopped administering its program in July 1987, when
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed state funds used to
supplement the operation. Labor groups have filed lawsuits and put
an initiative on the November ballot seeking reinstatement of the
program.
   The study noted that after OSHA cites an employer for safety
violations, the case is reviewed by seven different offices before
the Justice Department will bring it to trial.
   ``Instead of trying to determine how justice can be done,
they're trying to disqualify these cases. There isn't even one
full-time staff member assigned to these cases,'' Kinney said.
   But OSHA spokesman Frank White said the agency's civil penalties
can be effective. As an example, he pointed to a $4.2 million fine
against Bath Iron Works in Maine for safety and health violations.
   ``We think it's not the best use of our resources to chase
corporate outlaws,'' White said.
   The study concluded that the federal government's reluctance to
bring criminal prosecution has discouraged state and local
prosecutors from pursuing safety violators.

<HEAD>Mandelas Cancel Birthday Reunion In Protest Gesture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of jailed black
leader Nelson Mandela says she wants to focus attention on other
victims of apartheid and has spurned a government offer to visit
her husband on his 70th birthday.
   Winnie Mandela decided to spend the day at home on Monday rather
than accept the offer of a six-hour visit with her husband, who has
been jailed for 26 years, said family lawyer Ismail Ayob.
   ``She has taken this decision as both she and Mr. Mandela have
never sought any special privileges for themselves,'' he said
Friday.
   The visit would have been the longest reunion with Mandela,
leader of the outlawed African National Congress, since he was
jailed in 1962 for leaving South Africa illegally and inciting
unrest.
   While serving a five-year term, Mandela was sentenced to life in
prison in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the
government.
   The government confirmed the cancellation of the visit.
   Ayob said the Mandelas' decision was meant to ``focus attention
on the tens of thousands of mothers, sisters and daughters and to
the fathers, brothers and sons who have never had the privilege of
spending the day with their loved ones who remain in incarceration
for their opposition to apartheid.''
   The government, meanwhile, has been cracking down on various
events scheduled to honor Mandela on his birthday.
   Activists in Cape Town said 11 blacks organizing a sports
festval to commemorate Mandela's birthday were arrested Friday,
raising to about 25 the number of people detained in the area in
connection with the planned birthday celebrations.
   The government also has banned a huge charity concert planned
for Sunday near Soweto, Johannesburg's main black township. The
action was denounced as ``silly, vindictive and spiteful'' by Helen
Suzman, a parliament member for the anti-apartheid Progressive
Federal Party.
   Organizers in Cape Town said they would go ahead with a concert
on Sunday, planned for an indoor hall to avoid restrictions on
outdoor gatherings. But an indoor concert planned in Durban also
has been banned by police.
   Sports events are not covered by the restrictions. The Cape Town
activists said they did not know why police had detained the
organizers of a sports festival scheduled for today in Guguletu, a
black township.
   The Western Cape Teachers Union said its posters promoting a
Mandela tribute Friday night had been covered by stickers saying
``Cancelled.'' Hundreds of anonymous pamphlets criticizing Mandela
appeared overnight in the mixed-race township of Athlone.
   Under security regulations, organizers of all outdoor events
except sports activities and funerals must obtain permission from
authorities.
   Huge celebrations are also planned in London and Amsterdam this
weekend to commemorate Mandela's birthday.
   Numerous foreign governments, meanwhile, issued messages Friday
in honor of Mandela's birthday.
   Among those calling for Mandela's release were West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and
Sweden sent a message to Mandela on Friday saying they would press
for his release.
   The Italian government in Pretoria said it imported a copy of
Bernardo Bertolucci's film, ``The Last Emperor,'' because Mandela
wanted to see it. The Prison Service said it had not been informed
of any plans to deliver the film to Pollsmoor.

   A woman who secretly gave birth in an
airliner restroom concealed the pregnancy from her husband after he
raised questions about her weight gain while they were having
marital problems, a lawyer said.
   The husband, Louis Locasto, saw his 3-day-old daughter for the
first time on Friday and said he would fight to gain custody of
her. Social workers filed court documents seeking to keep the baby
for another 10 days.
   ``We'll make allegations regarding the behavior of the mother
that resulted in the need for us to intervene on behalf of the
child,'' said Robert McMillan, head of San Mateo County's
Children's Protective Services.
   Those allegations, filed in court Friday, are confidential,
McMillan said.
   Christina Marie Locasto, 24, surrendered to police Thursday and
was charged with felony child endangerment for leaving the newborn
under the restroom sink. She pleaded innocent and was released
after posting $50,000 bail.
   Locasto appeared shaken at a news conference Friday. He did not
speak, deferring to his lawyer, and Mrs. Locasto did not attend.
   ``We are going to request in court Monday that the child be
released to him as its father, and there are no charges against
him'' as an unfit parent, said his attorney Vicki Yeley.
   Attorneys for Mrs. Locasto say she also wants her daughter back.
   A closed hearing Monday in juvenile court will determine whether
to continue the county's temporary custody of the child; a
permanent custody hearing will be held later.
   Locasto told investigators he did not know his wife was pregnant
or had given birth during a flight Wednesday from Newark, N.J., to
San Francisco.
   Locasto suspected his wife was pregnant but she denied it when
he questioned her about the weight she had gained around her waist,
Yeley said.
   Mrs. Locasto told investigators the couple was having marital
problems at the time, but that those problems have since been
resolved, Yeley said, adding that Locasto has no reason to doubt
the infant is his.
   Earlier Friday, the New York City couple visited their baby at
Mills Memorial Hospital in San Mateo, about 30 miles south of San
Francisco, where the brown-haired, blue-eyed girl was in good
condition.
   Mrs. Locasto held her daughter and spoke to the pediatrician
caring for her. The parents said they will name the girl ``Alyssa
Frances.''
   San Mateo County sheriff's detectives say Mrs. Locasto expressed
no interest in the baby after she surrendered.
   ``She never has said one thing about the kid. She never asked
how it was,'' said sheriff's Sgt. Bob Morse. She admitted giving
birth to the child and putting her under the lavatory's sink, he
said.
   Mrs. Locasto is accused of delivering the full-term baby in the
lavatory of a United Airlines DC-10 just before it took off and
leaving her in a pile of blood-soaked towels under the sink.
   After the delivery, Mrs. Locasto resumed her seat with her
husband and two daughters, ages 18 months and 6 years, police said.
The 6-year-old is Locasto's from a previous marriage.
   Flight attendants, thinking Mrs. Locasto suffered from severe
diarrhea, sealed the restroom during the 5{-hour flight.
   A cleaning crew found the whimpering but healthy infant 20
minutes after Flight 35 landed in San Francisco.
   Sheriff's detectives used the passenger list to trace Mrs.
Locasto to a relative's home in Los Altos, 25 miles south of San
Francisco.

   A woman who was raped inside her home by an
intruder while police searched outside and left says the city
knowingly operated a flawed 911 telephone emergency system that
resulted in the attack.
   The woman and her husband made the charge in a lawsuit filed
against the city Friday in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court.
Their names were not disclosed.
   The lawsuit contends the city failed to adequately screen and
train employees for its 911 communications center and failed to
correct procedures ``so deficient that the continued maintenance of
them was outrageous and shocking to the conscience.''
   The woman's attorney, Jan Swensen, said the city advised
residents to dial 911 for emergency help and then failed to provide
that help.
   City Public Safety Director Glenn Cannon and city Solicitor Dan
Pellegrini declined to comment on the lawsuit.
   After an investigation, Cannon ordered 911 operators to pass on
detailed information about emergency calls and to question police
about how they resolve calls before officers are permitted to leave
the scene.
   Cannon also reprimanded five police officers and three 911
workers for failing to respond properly.
   The woman told police she dialed 911 at about 11:15 p.m. on Feb.
2 after she heard someone trying to break into her second-story
apartment in the city's Point Breeze neighborhood.
   While she was talking to the 911 operator, officials said a man
with a knife burst into the room and tore the telephone cord from
the wall. The 911 operator thought the woman had hung up, officials
said.
   When the intruder saw police walking around the house and heard
them knocking on her door, he threatened the woman and said he had
``nothing further to lose and that he might as well rape'' her, the
woman said.
   Police searched outside for several minutes and left,
authorities said. They didn't break down the woman's door because
911 operators failed to tell them that the woman reported the
break-in herself and that the call abruptly broke off, authorities
said.
   Police have made no arrests in the attack.

<HEAD>Former Soviet Soldiers In Afghanistan Blast Amnesty Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL CORMIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Soviet soldiers who deserted or were
captured while fighting in Afghanistan said they would refuse an
offer to return to their homeland because they feared retribution
from Soviet authorities.
   But a man who jumped to his feet during their news conference
Friday and identified himself as a Soviet diplomat said the men
would face no harm if they returned.
   ``Don't be shy. If you wish to be in contact, call the Soviet
Embassy in Washington,'' he called out to the former soldiers.
``Nobody will drag you out of the United States.''
   As other audience members jeered him, he strode to the front of
the room to put printed leaflets on the table in front of the men.
   He identified himself as Dmitry Titov of the Soviet Mission to
the United Nations. The leaflets bore a Soviet statement of July 4
that announced an offer of amnesty to soldiers who turned against
their country during its 8{-year war in Afghanistan.
   The news conference featuring the former soldiers was sponsored
by Freedom House, a New York-based human rights group. The six were
brought to the news conference by Freedom House, which had sought
their release.
   R. Bruce McColm, executive director of the organization, said he
called the meeting to urge the establishment of an international
commission, not linked to the Soviet Union, to address the issue of
Soviet and Afghan prisoners of war.
   He said a commission could ensure the estimated 200-300 Soviet
POWs remaining in the hands of anti-communist mujahedeen fighters
have a choice whether to return home or defect. Freedom House
estimates that many are deserters and some actually are fighting
for the insurgents.
   Friday's news conference, conducted in Russian and English
through an interpreter, was punctuated by outbursts in both
languages.
   Taras Derevlyany, 20, a private who left his army post on the
Kabul-Jalalabad highway three weeks after arriving in Afghanistan
in May 1987, looked in the direction of Titov and said, ``I don't
need your amnesty. America is a free country.''
   He paused and added, ``I give up my Soviet citizenship.''
   Derevlyany and the others said they felt the Soviet intervention
was a mistake and told how they were sickened by what they called
the Soviet slaughter of civilians, including children, in bombing
runs and ground attacks.
   ``I don't want to go back to the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``What
will people think of me? `He's a deserter, a traitor.'''
   Vladimir Romchuk, 22, a Soviet army deserter in 1985 who was
held by Afghan rebels until his release to the West in April, also
looked at the official and said, ``Yes, I am a deserter in your
eyes. But I am a happy person here.''
   The man identifying himself as a Soviet official afterward
called the news conference a politically orchestrated event that
apparently had only ``a few cases'' in mind and not the welfare of
all POWs left in Afghanistan.

   Nicaragua's ambassador to the United States,
who left Washington just minutes before a State Department deadline
for his departure, called his expulsion arbitrary and illegal.
   Carlos Tunnermann left Washington on a commercial flight five
minutes before the expulsion order took effect at 5:30 p.m. EDT
Friday.
   About a dozen police officers were at the airline's gate at
National Airport to make sure Tunnerman got on the plane. Two
police cars followed the jet out to the runway and waited for it to
depart.
   He spent Friday night in Mexico City and was expected to leave
today for Managua.
   At an airport news conference here, Tunnermann said his
government was right to expel U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton. But
he said the Reagan administration, which expelled him in
retaliation, had no basis for expelling Nicaraguan diplomats.
   ``If we expelled Melton we had reasons to do so because Melton .
.. was interfering in internal affairs of Nicaragua in the spirit
of destabilizing our government,'' he said.
   He said Melton attended meetings where participants discussed
replacing the Nicaraguan government.
   ``My work was absolutely diplomatic. We do not question the
decision of the United States, even though it was unjustified, but
in the case of Melton we were right,'' he said.
   Nicaragua expelled Melton and seven other U.S. Embassy officials
on Monday. A day later, the Reagan administration gave Tunnermann
and seven other embassy officials 72 hours to leave the country.
   The administration also described the action as retaliatory, but
said Tunnermann and the military attache, Maj. Pedro Sampson, had
abused their privilege of residence.
   Tunnermann called that ``a very vague charge.''
   For Tunnermann, it was an unhappy ending to his 3{-year stay in
Washington in the somewhat lonesome role as the Sandinista
government's chief defender in Washington.
   Tunnermann served both as ambassador to the United States and to
the Organization of American States, and he maintained throughout
that the United States had no right to expel him, citing guarantees
contained in the OAS charter.
   Shortly before leaving on his flight to Mexico City, he took a
parting shot at the administration, insisting that the U.S. action
threatened the independence of the OAS and saying his government
would seek recourse through OAS legal channels.
   In Mexico, he said the United States should have given the OAS a
list of the alleged abuses but did not.
   ``Today it's Nicaragua, tomorrow, another country,'' he said.
``This is the height of arbitrariness.''
   Nicaragua's expulsions of U.S. diplomats came the same day the
government closed a Roman Catholic radio station and an opposition
newspaper and one day after government troops violently suppressed
an anti-government demonstration.
   U.S. House and Senate condemnation of Sandinista leaders for the
crackdown on the opposition has revived the possibility that
Congress could approve new military aid for the U.S.-backed rebels
known as Contras.
   A temporary cease-fire with the rebels has been in effect since
March 21, but talks to extend it into a permanent agreement
collapsed in June. Each side accuses the other of violating the
truce.
   In Managua, Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto issued a statement
saying Tunnermann would remain as Nicaragua's ambassador to the OAS
``until this controversy can be elucidated.''
   Tunnermann repeatedly challenged U.S. officials to present
evidence of the wrongdoing he and Sampson were alleged to have
engaged in. The administration has said it was under no obligation
to provide details.
   Tunnerman's wife, Rosa, said she and the couple's seven
children, will remain in the Washington area where they have a home
in a fashionable section of suburban Maryland.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against Treasure Hunters</HEAD>

   A federal judge has ruled that a sunken 17th
century Spanish galleon found a year ago belongs to the state of
Florida, not the two men who have claimed it and up to $500,000 in
booty.
   Under Friday's ruling, Peter Leo and Dominic Addario of Jupiter
would have to surrender the treasure, including 2,500 gold and
silver coins, a large silver bar dated 1652, a small gold bar and
several cannons.
   The treasure, worth $300,000 to $500,000, will remain in the
hands of a conservator while the ruling is appealed. U.S. District
Judge Stanley Marcus banned any other salvagers from taking
artifacts from the wreck in Jupiter Inlet.
   The two men, who have incorporated under the name Jupiter Wreck,
Inc., discovered the sunken galleon last summer buried in the sand
about 100 yards off the inlet's beach.
   Last August the state Department of Natural Resources sought an
injuction to stop them from exploiting the galleon. The department
said the wreck belonged to the state and the men needed a license
to remove anything.
   Leo, 33, and Addario, 39, represented by attorney David Horan,
who also worked for Key West treasure hunter Mel Fisher in a score
of similar actions, countered by seeking an injuction barring the
state from interfering with them, but Marcus ruled against them.
   Horan said Marcus' decision contradicted previous rulings by
Chief U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in a Fisher case, and
that he would appeal it to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.

<HEAD>Flight Delays Leave Thousands Stranded In British Airports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNE APPLEBAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of tourists began their summer holidays
by camping at British airports as the aftereffects of a Greek air
traffic controllers' strike wreaked havoc on already busy summer
flight schedules.
   On Friday, the average delay in flights from Britain to the
Mediterranean was six hours, with some flights delayed up to 48
hours at Manchester's airport in north England and up to 24 hours
at London's Gatwick Airport.
   Director Keith Mack of the Civil Aviation Authority said he
expected the congestion at British airports to worsen this summer
with possible further job action by air traffic controllers in
Spain and France.
   And it won't be any better next year unless improvements are
made in Europe's outdated air traffic control system, he said.
   ``With the kinds of traffic levels we've been experiencing, it's
going to be several years before we have a system which can deal
with that sort of increase,'' he said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. television interview.
   Mack said that the improved British economy, rainy summer
weather and a the proliferation of cheap holiday tours were also to
blame for the extended delays.
   ``Suddenly people had more money to spend on holidays abroad and
they all wanted to head for the sun,'' he said.
   The number of travelers passing through British airports
increased by 30 percent from 1981 to 1987. During the same period,
London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports rose to become the two
busiest in Europe.
   At Gatwick, which handles most of Britain's charter flights,
spokesman Dave Hurst said most travelers were well behaved despite
the long delays.
   ``They've taken the `phlegmatic Brit' approach and realize the
airport staff are not to blame,'' he said.
   Up to 4,000 travelers camped out in Gatwick each night in the
past week. They consumed daily 10,000 pints of beer, 20,000 cups of
tea and coffee, 6,000 sandwiches and 10,000 breakfasts, according
to Gatwick's catering manager Peter Ransome.
   Hurst said Gatwick brought in extra cleaning staff, extended
restaurant hours and employed magicians, clowns and jugglers to
entertain children.
   Manchester's Ringway Airport began turning people away Friday,
saying it had reached full capacity. Passengers at Luton airport
north of London began returning home after flights were delayed
indefinitely.
   Flights from Britain to southern Europe now must get permission
from seven different air traffic control towers. This multinational
system is likely to grow more cumbersome as the number of European
flights is expected to double by the year 2000.
   Outdated air traffic control facilities were also cited as the
cause of a series of near-collisions involving British planes
flying south in February.
   To deal with these problems, transport ministers of the
12-nation European Economic Community met in June and agreed to set
up an emergency telephone link between Europe's five busiest air
centers _ London, Frankfurt, Paris, Rome and Madrid _ and a crisis
center coordinating all West European air traffic during the four
or five busiest weekends of the summer.
   The Greek air traffic controllers' strike ended Wednesday, but
French controllers are threatening job action Monday in a dispute
over pay, conditions, and pensions.
   Spanish controllers have staged ``flow control'' actions
limiting the number of flights which can land in Spain, and have
also threatened work stoppages to protest bad conditions.

<HEAD>Ten More Deaths in Bangladesh, Flood-Related Diseases in New Delhi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of 10 more deaths raised the
toll from monsoon floods in Bangladesh to 210, and the annual heavy
rains caused flooding and health problems in wide areas of
neighboring India.
   All 10 who died Friday in Bangladesh were children, including
four who died of diarrhea contracted from impure water, newspapers
reported today.
   In the Indian capital of New Delhi, at least 18 people have died
of gastroenteritis brought on by flood conditions, and 500 other
cases of the disease are being treated, Indian news reports said
today.
   The independent Times of India newspaper said at least 76 cases
of cholera developed in New Delhi. Most of the cholera and
gastroenteritis cases were reported in slum areas with few drainage
or sewage facilities.
   Fifteen people were killed and 25,000 driven from their homes
late Thursday night when floods swept through the town of Surat in
India's Gujarat statae, the United News of India reported.
   The deaths brought to 65 the number who have died in flooding
brought on by monsoon rains across India in the past three weeks.
Floods have affected the Indian states of Assam, Bihar, Kashmir and
Uttar Pradesh.
   In Bangladesh, four children died from diarrhea in Habiganj
district in the country's northeast Friday, the independent
Bengali-language newspaper Khabar reported.
   It said six other children drowned when caught in flood-swollen
ponds in the neighboring district of Kishoreganj and in
Brahmanbaria district east of the capital at Dhaka.
   Officials at the Flood Control Ministry in Dhaka said today that
water levels were receding in most flooded areas except
Brahmanbaria and Manikganj, southwest of the capital.
   At least 3,000 people were forced out of their homes by floods
Friday in Manikganj, the officials said.
   In Narsigdi, Bangladesh's main handloom center, about 10,000
weavers were driven from their jobs as waters rushed into loom
houses, officials in the town near Dhaka said by telephone.
   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad toured some flooded areas
Friday and told local officials to step up projects for immediate
relief and begin rehabilitation programs in areas where water was
receding.
   ``We shall face the flood as boldly and efficiently as we did
during last year's flooding, the worst in 70 years,'' Ershad told
flood victims in Netronka district.
   Last year, the army was credited with saving many lives as
massive floods hit this impoverished nation of 105 million people.
Still, the 1987 floods claimed 1,200 lives.

   The morning drive to work can be a
bore, but when a real boar got loose on a south Chicago highway,
things picked up.
   The large male hog apparently fell off a pig-hauling truck on
the Calumet Expressway on Friday morning, police said.
   ``At 6:09 a.m., somebody calls the state police and reports a
large pig in the roadway,'' said Capt. Anthony Lucito of the
Calumet City police. ``It's big. I'd say between 700 and 1,000
pounds. It's no small pig.''
   While traffic on the expressway was stalled, police spent about
30 minutes looking for the ponderous porker, he said, and it didn't
put up much of a fight.
   ``It was skinned up from falling off the truck,'' Lucito said.
   By Friday afternoon, the big hog was resting comfortably in a
cage at the dog pound, Lucito said. ``We're watering it down and
giving it a lot of food,'' he said.
   State police will return the pig if its owner claims it,
officials said.
   It's not all that unusual for pigs to fall off big trucks that
haul them around the country, state police Sgt. Sterling Bosco said.
   ``I had it happen to me about 10 years ago. I had a little pig
on I-55. Me and a couple of other guys tackled it and I put my
handcuffs on it,'' Bosco recalled, chuckling.
   ``The next guy I arrested I told him, `Hey, you know, I last
used these handcuffs on a pig.'''

<DATELINE>WICHITA FALLS, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Corpus Christi resort manager who
once warned tourists about straying into Wichita Falls apologized
for insulting the city and handed out T-shirts calling for ``Peace
in Our Time.''
   Stern Feinberg Jr. said Friday he never meant to offend this
city of 100,000 on the North Texas plains when he mailed out a
promotional letter asking Texas tourists to think of his hotel on
their next trip.
   ``Summer is coming and you will probably want to take an auto
trip through Texas,'' the letter began. He included a map, saying
``without a good map you might wander aimlessly around the state
and something awful (could) happen to you, like ending up in
Wichita Falls.''
   Jim Lonergan, publisher of the Wichita Falls Times Record News,
heard about the promotion and alerted the city's Board of Commerce
and Industry. Feinberg was invited to visit the city and Lonergan
guaranteed his personal safety.
   Feinberg and Corpus Christi Mayor Betty Turner took Lonergan up
on the offer and spent a day in Wichita Falls.
   Flanked by civic leaders, Feinberg and Mrs. Turner began their
tour at the city's 54-foot-high waterfall, where he was mockingly
arrested for breaking a city ordinance by taking off his shoes and
climbing high along the rocks around the waterfall.
   ``Aw, he'll fall. We'll get sued,'' one spectator groaned as he
watched Feinberg, whose hobby is rock climbing, scamper along the
boulders.
   Feinberg finished the day by passing out the T-shirts that said:
``Peace in our Time'' across the back, along with: ``I Survived the
Wichita Falls-Corpus Christi Summit, July 15, 1988.''

<HEAD>Woman Found Incompetent To Stand Trial Second Time In Letterman
Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who claimed to be David
Letterman's wife will undergo psychiatric treatment before a judge
considers for the third time whether she is competent to face
charges that she broke into the TV talk show host's home and stole
his car.
   Superior Court Judge James Bingham on Friday ordered 36-year-old
Margaret Ray, of no known address, to return to court Oct. 14 for
reconsideration of his second finding that she is incompetent to
stand trial.
   Bingham ordered the woman to undergo six months of psychiatric
treatment in the state hospital where she has been a patient for
the past several weeks.
   The judge ruled last month that although Ray could understand
the charges, she was unable to assist in her defense. She has been
held in lieu of $25,000 bail and treated at Fairfield Hills
Hospital.
   Bingham allowed another psychiatric examination after Ray
objected to the first report by a doctor who found she was
``delusional.''
   The second psychiatrist, Sander H. Fogle of Fairfield Hills,
told Bingham on Friday that he also believed Ray couldn't assist in
her defense.
   Fogle testified that Ray would be helped by six months of
psychotherapy and lithium treatments.
   Police allege that Ray broke into Letterman's New Canaan home in
May while he was out of town and lived there for several days
before stealing his car.
   She was arrested May 22 at a Lincoln Tunnel toll booth in
Weehawken, N.J. Authorities became suspicious when the woman and
her 3-year-old son drove up in Letterman's 1988 Porsche 911 but
couldn't pay the $3 toll.
   Ray told police she was Letterman's wife and the boy was the NBC
talk-show host's son.
   Three days later she was released from jail after Letterman
asked police to drop the charges. That afternoon she allegedly
again broke into Letterman's house. Ray faces two counts of
second-degree burglary and one count of first-degree larceny.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury in the final trial stemming from the
Howard Beach racial attack found three of the four defendants
guilty of misdemeanor riot charges but acquitted them all of felony
charges.
   William Bollander, Thomas Farino and James Povinelli, all 18,
were found guilty Friday of second-degree riot, punishable by up to
a year in prison. They were acquitted of first-degree riot, a
felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years.
   John Saggese, 20, was found innocent of both counts.
   The case stemmed from the Dec. 20, 1986, attack by a white gang
on three blacks in the Howard Beach section of Queens. One of the
blacks, Michael Griffith, 23, was killed when struck by a car as he
fled the gang.
   ``I'll deal with it, that's all. I'm going to beat this,''
Bollander said after the verdict.
   ``I prayed,'' said Saggese. Displaying a small religious object,
he said, ``I had my hand on this the whole time.''
   Saggese said he told his friends and co-defendants, ``I'm sorry.
   ``I feel a year and a half of torture is over for me, but not my
friends. They're not guilty, but we're going to stick together.''
   Friends and relatives wept and embraced as the guilty verdicts
were read, then cheered at Saggese's acquittal.
   The verdict came after the jury said it was deadlocked earlier
in the day, prompting the government to offer a plea bargain of
youthful offender status and probation, according to sources on
both sides of the case. The offer was rejected.
   ``To the day I die, I'll know I did the right thing,'' said
Bollander, fighting back tears, referring to the decision to reject
the plea bargain.
   Bollander's attorney, Todd D. Greenberg, said all three will
file an appeal immediately after their Sept. 14 sentencing. But
Richard La Rosa, attorney for Farino, said, ``We'll have to see.
It's an expensive process.''
   The jury told state Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos in a
noontime note: ``We are not at an impasse. We are against a
mountain.''
   Demakos, however, noted that there had been five weeks of
testimony, and said, ``This is far too an important matter ... for
you, after a trial of this length, simply to throw in the sponge. I
ask that you reason with each other and listen to reason.''
   Griffith's mother said after the verdict, ``Now is not for
rejoicing. Now is for prayer.''
   On Thursday, a separate jury in the case cleared Thomas
Gucciardo, 19, of all charges, including attempted murder. The jury
foreman said the defendant had not been positively identified.
   Three youths were convicted of manslaughter in December in the
attack, and a fourth youth was acquitted. Two other teen-agers
pleaded guilty to felony riot charges just prior to the second
trial.
   Felony riot involves ``tumultuous and violent conduct'' by a
group of more than 10 people. Misdemeanor or second-degree riot
involves such conduct by a group of more than four people.

   Fire devasted a hotel in northern Paris early
today, killing four people and injuring several more, including
American, West German, British and Belgian tourists, police said.
   The names of the foreigners injured in the blaze were not made
public, and officials said the four dead had not been identified.
   The fire started at about 3:30 a.m. on the fourth floor of the
Hotel St. Vincent de Paul on rue d'Hauteville, in a run-down
neighborhood a few blocks from the Gare du Nord train station.
   By the time firemen got it under control, the building was

known, but appeared to be accidental.
   The manager of the hotel, Bernard Bonhomme, was among the
injured taken to a hospital for treatment. The others were not

<DATELINE>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven weeks after her arrest, former
Miss America Bess Myerson changed her plea to guilty to charges
that she shoplifted jewelry, cosmetics and other items from a South
Williamsport discount store.
   Miss Myerson, 64, was arrested by South Williamsport Police
Chief Charles Smith after leaving the Hills Department Store on May
27 with $44 in merchandise. She said at at the time, and reiterated
in a statement handed to reporters Friday, that she was only
``leaving the store to lock (her) car'' and planned to return and
``pay for the merchandise.''
   Her attorney delivered the signed guilty plea to the retail
theft charge Friday morning to the office of District Justice John
M. McDermott.
   ``I represent that I make this plea knowingly, voluntarily and
intelligently. I plead guilty,'' the form signed by Miss Myerson
said.
   McDermott fined Myerson $100, plus $48.50 court costs.
   ``That's the normal fine and costs for a first offense,'' he
said. ``It's over with.''
   According to published reports, Miss Myerson was arrested for
shoplifting in London in the early 1970s.
   However, Assistant District Attorney Kenneth Osokow said that
based on the state crimes code, the London offense cannot be
considered a prior retail theft arrest here because it occurred
before to the adoption of a new state shoplifting law.
   The fine was paid by Miss Myerson's attorney when he delivered
the guilty plea. The $150 bail she posted at the time of her arrest
is being returned to the New York City resident, who faces federal
charges for allegedly trying to influence the judge handling the
divorce of her reputed lover, Carl A. Capasso.
   Capasso is serving a sentence at nearby Allenwood Federal Prison
Camp for tax evasion.
   Myerson reigned as Miss America in 1945 and most recently served
as New York City's cultural affairs commissioner. She reportedly is
worth $16 million.

<TEXT>
   A Frenchman killed aboard a Greek cruise
ship during an attack by gunmen was himself a terrorist, the Greek
government said, but people who knew him denied the allegation.
   Sources also said an Arab passenger was arrested for possible
involvement in the bloody assault on stunned passengers sunbathing
on the City of Poros cruise ship.
   Nine people were killed and 98 were wounded in Monday's attack
when men fired automatic weapons and hurled hand grenades at
tourists when the ship was about 16 miles off the Greek coast in
the Aegean Sea.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Friday
that an Arab man was being interrogated at police headquarters in
central Athens about possible involvement in the attack. They
declined to give details.
   Claims of responsibility have been attributed to three groups,
but none of the claims could be authenticated.
   One claim came in a letter purportedly sent by the Jewish
Defense League to the Greek Embassy in the Netherlands, the
state-run Athens News Agency reported today.
   The letter claims the Jewish extremist group staged the massacre
to protest Greece's support of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, the agency said. Leaders of the group could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   In Lebanon on Wednesday, a previously unknown group calling
itself the Organization of the Martyrs of the Popular Revolution in
Palestine claimed responsbility.
   Earlier, the Islamic Jihad organization purportedly claimed
responsbility in a telephone call to a French radio station from
Cairo.
   The Greek government statement identified the slain Frenchman as
Roland Vigneron, 23, and said he was involved in the attack.
   The statement also said the government had not ruled out that
another man identified as a terrorist, Mohammed Zozad, was among
the dead.
   It said police confirmed that the massacre was linked to a car
bomb explosion that killed two men near the ship's home dock about
six hours before the attack. The two were in the car when the bomb
apparently went off by mistake.
   ``Both actions were carried out by the same terrorist group,''
the statement said.
   The government statement said eight witnesses identified
Vigneron as one of the terrorists. It said he died of injuries at
Tzanneion Hospital in Piraeus, a port near Athens, where the
injured were rushed after the attack.
   In Paris, French television said a Frenchman named Laurent
Vigneron died in the attack.
   Greek authorities spell foreign names phonetically in Greek
script because they are unfamiliar with the Latin alphabet. They
apparently confused Roland with Laurent.
   Laurent Vigneron's parents confirmed he died of wounds at
Tzanneion Hospital.
   Reached by telephone in Mehun-sur-Yevre in central France,
Christine Audejean, the mother of Laurent Vigneron's girlfriend,
said she could not believe he was a terrorist. She said her
daughter, Annie, accompanied Vigneron on the cruise and is now
missing.
   ``We've known Laurent for two years. He's a very sweet boy, very
calm. They were lovers leaving on a honeymoon. They were going to
get engaged the following week,'' she said.
   She said both were engineering students in France.
   Mrs. Audejean said Vigneron was probably mistaken for a
terrorist because he had dark hair and complexion.
   The French Foreign Ministry said Friday it was not aware of any
evidence of Vigneron's involvement and asked Greek authorities to
provide an explanation.
   Police speculated that guns, grenades and explosives inside the
car that exploded were intended for hijacking the ship. They said
the terrorists may have been seeking freedom for Mohammed Rashid, a
Palestinian jailed in Greece for entering the country with a forged

   The former Conrail engineer who caused an
Amtrak crash that killed 16 people faces three more years in prison
for conspiring to obstruct an investigation of the accident, the
worst in Amtrak history.
   Rick L. Gates is already serving a five-year prison sentence on
a state charge of manslaughter by locomotive. The federal term
ordered Friday by U.S. District Judge Norman Ramsey will be served
consecutively.
   Gates drove three linked Conrail engines through a closed track
switch and into the path of a high-speed Amtrak passenger train
near Chase, Md., in January 1987. The accident also left 175 people
injured.
   Gates, 34, of suburban Essex was charged April 1 in federal
court with four counts, including conspiracy, obstruction of an
agency investigation and two counts of making false statements to
investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Gates pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy for lying to NTSB
investigators about following safety procedures and smoking
marijuana with his brakeman before the crash. Prosecutors agreed to
dismiss the other charges.
   The brakeman, Edward Cromwell, was granted immunity from federal
and state prosecutors for his cooperation in the case.
   The prosecution sought the maximum sentence, five years in
prison. Gates' attorney had requested that Gates be sentenced to
two or three years in prison, with all but six months suspended,
and supervised probation after he is released.
   Relatives of victims said Gates' sentence was not as important
as federal legislation to mandate drug and alcohol testing of
transportation workers.
   ``I don't want to be Mr. Gates' judge. I think we need to focus
on finding the next 10 or 20 Ricky Gates out there before they kill
people,'' said Roger Horn of Baltimore, whose 16-year-old daughter
was killed in the crash.

   A Bhopal magistrate today issued a fourth
summons for former Union Carbide Corp. Chairman Warren Anderson to
appear in court on criminal charges stemming from the 1984 Bhopal
gas disaster.
   Kanhaiya Lal Sisodia, chief Bhopal judicial magistrate, approved
the summons after a government lawyer complained earlier papers
were not served because Anderson and Union Carbide were ``trying to
avoid being prosecuted in India.
   ``How can the marriage procession go ahead without the
bridegroom?'' government attorney U.S. Prasad told a hearing in
this central Indian city.
   Sisodia also ordered Robert Kennedy, now chairman of the
Danbury, Conn.-based corporation, to appear in court here Sept. 24
in connection with the criminal charge against Union Carbide.
   Kennedy was not named as a defendant when the case was filed in
December.
   The criminal charge against Union Carbide, Anderson and other
company officers is one of four legal actions filed before Indian
courts stemming from a massive leak of lethal gas on Dec. 3, 1984,
from a pesticide plant run by a Carbide subsidiary.
   Nearly 3,000 people were killed and at least 20,000 seriously
injured in what is regarded as the world's worst industrial
accident.
   The criminal charges accuse Carbide and the others of homicide
and causing injury. Before today, the court had issued three
summonses for Anderson.
   Prasad, attorney for the Central Bureau of Investigation, the
Indian equivalent of the American FBI, said the papers could not be
served because ``Union Carbide is suppressing his address in the
U.S.A.''
   Anderson has not been located depite the efforts of the Indian
Foreign Ministry and Interpol, Prasad said.
   The former Carbide chairman came to India at the time of the
1984 disaster and was arrested and jailed. But he was freed on
$1,785 bail put up by the accountant of the subsidiary, Union
Carbide of India Limited.
   Sisodia ordered accountant A.M. Kuruvila to appear in court
after Prasad argued bail papers required Kuruvila to present
Anderson in court when required.
   In addition to the criminal charges, the Indian government has
filed a $3 billion civil damage suit maintaining negligence by
Union Carbide caused the gas leak. Union Carbide argues the leak
resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   The two sides also are arguing in the Indian courts over a $270
million interim judgment for damages against Carbide. India
maintains the amount is not enough. Carbide says the ruling amounts
to a pre-judgment before the case is actually decided.
   In addition, Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located, has
filed a suit accusing Union Carbide of contempt of court for its
request that the judge hearing the damage suit remove himself from
the case because of bias.
   District Judge M.W. Deo turned down the request, denying any
bias.

   A ghoulish case in which prosecutors
presented body fragments as evidence that an airline pilot murdered
his wife and used a wood chipper to dispose of her corpse ended in
a mistrial after a hold-out juror refused to deliberate any longer.
   Juror Warren Maskell Jr. of Preston adamantly refused to discuss
the case of defendant Richard Crafts any further Friday evening
after 17 days of deliberations. He also refused to heed a judge's
order to return to the courtroom so the case could be recessed
until today.
   A source who spoke on condition of anonymity said Maskell was
the lone juror who refused to vote for conviction.
   Superior Court Judge Barry Schaller, who declared the mistrial
Friday night, said Maskell informed him: ``I am sorry, but after
voting eight times in at least a week with the same results, I
cannot continue to deliberate in a clear and open mind. I am truly
sorry.''
   ``Twelve people took an oath to do a job and 11 were willing to
do so and one was not,'' said the prosecutor, State's Attorney
Walter Flanagan.
   The prosecutor said he was not ready to discuss whether he would
retry Crafts, 50, of Newtown for the alleged murder, by unknown
means, of his Danish-born wife, Helle. He previously had indicated
he would, if necessary, seek a second trial.
   Defense attorney J. Daniel Sagarin said his client was
disappointed by the outcome, saying Crafts wanted a verdict so ``he
could go back to his children.''
   Crafts, a pilot for Eastern Airlines and part-time police
officer, was arrested Jan. 13, 1987, after body fragments,
including splintered pieces of human bone and a partial tooth, were
found by state police.
   Mrs. Crafts, a 39-year-old stewardess, was last seen Nov. 18,
1986.
   The case was believed to be the first murder prosecution in the
state without a body, and lawyers said the deliberations were the
longest by a Connecticut jury in a criminal case in recent memory.
   The jury declared itself deadlocked Friday afternoon, but
Schaller instructed jurors to continue deliberating.
   The judge said Maskell left the jury room and refused to return.
Schaller quoted Maskell as saying, ``I'm out of there and I'm not
going back in there.''
   Escorted by sheriff's deputies, Maskell left the courthouse
before the other jurors. His son said late Friday his father would
have a comment in a couple days.
   Prosecutors said they didn't know how Crafts allegedly killed
his wife, but they presented evidence they said showed he used a
chain saw and wood chipper to dispose of her body.
   More than 100 witnesses and 650 exhibits were presented over 53
days of the trial, which was moved to this southeastern Connecticut
city from western Connecticut because of pretrial publicity.
   Much of the state's case was based on circumstantial evidence:
Crafts was the last person to see his wife alive and she had
planned to start divorce proceedings after a private detective she
hired found evidence of his marital infidelity.
   The state conceded that its experts could only say with
certainty that one body part _ a partial, crowned tooth _ belonged
to Mrs. Crafts.
   Crafts told the jury he believed his wife was still alive.

   An 8-year-old boy who was revived after he fell
into a freezer while searching for Popsicles never regained
consciousness and later died.
   Doctors said Friday it was a miracle the youth had even been
resuscitated. ``We've never had anyone survive so long. This is
what makes it so unusual,'' said Dr. Stephen Evans of St. Joseph
Hospital in Lorain.
   The heartbeat and body temperature of 8-year-old Joseph Krogg
were restored by doctors several hours after the boy arrived at the
hospital Thursday night, but he made no further progress. He was
airlifted to Rainbow Babies' and Children's Hospital in Cleveland,
where he died at 4:02 p.m. Friday.
   ``He was put on life support, and he never regained
consciousness,'' said Jane Yousey, a Rainbow spokeswoman.
   The youth was reported missing by his parents about 5 p.m.
Thursday, said Detective Sgt. Joe Monia of the Sheffield Lake
Police Department. His father, Dale Krogg, found him at 6:30 p.m.
when he went to the freezer in the garage to get meat for dinner.
   Joseph apparently fell into the freezer while trying to reach
some Popsicles, and the lid closed and latched, Monia said.
   Evans had told Krogg that the chances of resuscitating his son
were one in a million.
   Doctors warmed Joseph's body, on which icicles had formed, by
running tubes of warm saline through his stomach and bladder and
wrapping him in electric blankets.
   About 11 p.m. Thursday, Joseph's heart began to beat again, and
by 1 a.m. Friday he had a strong pulse, adequate blood pressure and
his temperature returned to normal, Evans said.

   Recent rain in central and south Alabama haven't helped cities'
water supplies enough to lift surcharges and limits on outdoor
watering.
   Northern Alabama has missed most of the rain and the region's
top crop, cotton, is in a critical situation, said John Trotman,
state director of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service.

   Georgia's carpet industry may be forced to reduce production and
lay off workers if the drought continues for an extended period,
industry officials said.
   ``It is something you don't like to think about, but if you
don't have water, you can't run your mills,'' said John A. Shaheen,
vice chairman of World Carpets Inc. in Dalton.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ILLINOIS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The drought has inflicted serious damage to wildlife along the
Illinois River, even though the water level has remained near
normal.
   Wayne Herndon, a biologist with the state Department of
Conservation, said the drought, now nearly midway through its
second summer, has damaged the river's backwater lakes, virtually
eliminating a year's supply of the river's gamefish.
   The mercury hit 100 degrees Friday at O'Hare International
Airport, bettering the previous high for the day of 99 and
establishing a second record by giving the city its fifth
100-degree or better temperature of the summer. Chicago sweltered
through four 100-degree days in 1934, 1947 and 1953.

   Thunderstorms brought rain, lightning and 70 mph winds to
northern Indiana Friday night, causing widespread power outages in
the city of Fort Wayne and apparently causing a toy factory to
collapse. No injuries were reported.
   The Indiana Board of Health issued a heat warning as
temperatures soared above 100 and humidity levels boosted the heat
index to more than 110 degrees. The National Weather Service said
the conditions likely would continue through the weekend.

   Severe thunderstorms spawning tornadoes and strong winds rolled
across central Kansas Friday night. A tornado touched down near
Clay Center, destroying an unoccupied mobile home and damaging
barns and hog sheds. High winds also damaged trees and power lines.

   Agriculture Commissioner Ward ``Butch'' Burnette returned from
Oregon, saying he had prospects for perhaps 10,000 tons of hay,
badly needed by cattle producers. One railroad, CSX Transportation
Corp., offered to bring the hay free of charge from Chicago if the
Union Pacific or Burlington Northern lines could get it to Chicago.
   Thirty tons of Oregon hay arrived by jet in Louisville, courtesy
of United Parcel Service. That shipment, like several others, was
earmarked for distribution Monday.

   Severe thunderstorms accompanied by high winds and hail moved
over much of Michigan on Friday, downing trees and causing power
outages. Concern over the effects of the drought on the timber
industry outweighed relief brought by the showers.
   ``You have to take more precautions, and you can't use certain
machinery with exhaust systems that send sparks that might set a
fire,'' said Matt Repar, who has been logging for 28 years.
   The U.S. Forest Service has banned all machinery with internal
combustion engines from the Upper Peninsula's Hiawatha National
Forest after noon. John McGregor of the state Department of Natural
Resources has said that if the drought keeps up, the state may ban
commercial logging.

   A brief thunderstorm brought little relief following record heat
that helped kill 3,000 young turkeys near Princeton and prompted
health warnings.
   Friday's high of 102 degrees in the Twin Cities topped the
previous record for the date, 101 degrees i 1931. With the ``heat
index'' _ the summertime equivalent of the wind-chill factor _
forecasters said 102 degrees felt like 114.
   ``This is the kind of situation that is really bad for the sick

   Thunderstorms rumbled over much of the nation today after hot,
moist and unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico clashed with a cold
front from Kansas to Wisconsin to whip up tornadoes, damaging
winds, hail and rain.
   In Nebraska, three tornadoes were reported in the Omaha and
Council Bluffs areas Friday, damaging more than 100 homes and
flipping railroad cars. Trees and power lines were damaged or
downed in Omaha.
   In Kansas, the same line of thunderstorms spawned a tornado near
Wakefield; caused 55 to 60 mph winds at Abilene; produced damaging
winds at Minneapolis, and blasted Ellsworth with 1}-inch hail.
   Thunderstorms swirling through Wisconsin and Minnesota ripped
down trees and brought hail nearly 2 inches in diameter.
Thunderstorms also produced damaging winds in portions of Indiana
and Michigan.
   In lower Michigan, Kent County was pummeled by 1{-inch hail. A
building roof was destroyed and several trees were damaged in Emmet
County.
   In Florida, tornadoes touched down at Tarpon Springs, where
there was damage to several unoccupied trailer homes. Two tornadoes
were reported near Palatka.
   Today's forecast called for rain and thunderstorms from northern
and central New England across inland New York, through Florida and
the central Gulf of Mexico coast; showers and thunderstorms
scattered over northern Indiana and northern Illinois, and
generally sunny weather over the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s and 80s over northern
New England, inland New York, Michigan, Wisconsin and from
Minnesota across the northern tier of states through Washington
into northern Oregon; in the 70s and 80s along the California
coast; the upper 90s and 100 degrees from southern West Virginia
across southern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee,
northern Georgia, much of Mississippi, Kansas, central Texas,
western Colorado and northern Utah; near 115 degrees through the
desert Southwest, and in the 90s through the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 97 degrees at
Glendale, Ariz.

   The government today released a lawyer and
critic of the government who was detained in May after he met with
a U.S. diplomat, officials said.
   A statement released by the Home Affairs Ministry said Francis
Seow, a former solicitor general and ex-president of the country's
Law Society, was freed on condition that he not travel outside
Singapore or associate with foreign diplomats.
   Seow was detained May 6 under Singapore's Internal Security Act
after he met with U.S. diplomats including E. Mason Hendrickson,
then-first secretary of the U.S. Embassy's political section.
   The government expelled Hendrickson, saying he meddled in
Singapore's internal affairs by allegedly encouraging Seow and
other lawyers to contest the governing People's Action Party in the
next general election.
   Washington rejected the allegations, insisting Hendrickson's
actions were within accepted diplomatic bounds, and in turn ousted
a diplomat from Singapore.
   The Home Affairs Ministry statement said today that the order
releasing Seow would be ``revoked if Seow acts in any manner
prejudicial to the security of Singapore or breaches any
restrictive condition.''

   Soviet military teams set out today to inspect
missile facilities in Oklahoma, Texas and Alabama in their second
round of inspections under the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
treaty.
   Under the procedures outlined in the treaty, the Soviets
announced which sites they would visit minutes before they departed.
   The first team of 10 Soviet inspectors, accompanied by 10
escorts from the U.S. sites, announced where they wanted to go at 4
a.m. EDT, were in a bus by 5 a.m. and en route to Ft. Sill, Okla.,
before 6 a.m., said Cmdr. Kendell Pease, spokesman for the On-Site
Inspection Agency set up under the treaty.
   The treaty was signed last December by President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their Washington summit.
   Contacted on his car telephone en route to Washington's Dulles
Airport with a second team traveling to Longhorn Army Depot in
Marshall, Texas, Pease said the operations was ``moving like
clockwork.''
   He said two other teams picked separate facilities at Redstone
Arsenal in Huntsville, Ala. Those teams also were en route after
making their site selection known at 6 a.m., Pease said.
   ``We're ready and we're making it work,'' he said.
   The 40 Soviet inspectors had arrived in Washington Thursday
aboard an Aeroflot plane and were flying to the sites in Air Force
C141 aircraft. They were to return to Washington within 24 hours
after the inspections for a flight back to Moscow.
   The Soviets were to verify the number of missiles and related
components to be destroyed under the treaty. The elimination of
6,000 Soviet missiles under U.S. scrutiny is to begin Aug. 1 at
five sites in the Soviet Union, but U.S. officials have not yet
informed Soviet authorities when they will begin destroying about
2,000 U.S. weapons.
   The Soviet teams had between four and 48 hours after their
arrival to notify U.S. authorities which of five locations they
intended to inspect, and Pease said they met that deadline with the
selection of Fort Sill.
   Five Soviet teams arrived on the West Coast at the beginning of
this month to inspect INF sites there, and 23 Soviets have been in
Magna, Utah, since July 2 in Magna, Utah, preparing a permanent
inspection station at the Hercules Plant No. 1 where U.S. missiles
were produced.
   The Soviet side is to inspect 26 sites in the United States and
Europe, and 12 U.S. teams are to visit 133 sites within the current
60-day ``baseline inspection'' period authorized in the treaty,
Pease said. He said 40 Soviet sites have already been visited by
U.S. teams.
   At Redstone, one Soviet group is visiting a launch repair
facility and the other a missile storage area, Pease said.
   The treaty calls for the elimination of all intermediate-range
missiles within three years. Destruction of U.S. missiles is to
take place at the Texas site, in Pueblo, Colo., and Davis Monthan
Air Force Base outside Tuscon, Ariz.
   At Longhorn in Texas, inspectors will see that there are no
missiles now, Pease said. Future teams can then track the missile
components and witness the elimination when it takes place, he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Will Resume Processing Applications So Soviets Can Leave</HEAD>

   The U.S. Embassy said today it will resume the
processing of thousands of Soviets seeking refugee status in
America but stranded in the Soviet Union because of a lack of State
Department funds.
   Many of the prospective refugees or their relatives in the
United States will now be asked to help pay their way to America,
the embassy said.
   The U.S. mission's action, announced in a statement, will begin
Monday. It follows criticism in Washington of the State
Department's decision to delay the emigration of Soviets granted
refugee status because of a surge in their numbers and a shortage
of money.
   That decision has left hundreds of Soviets in limbo. They had
sold their homes, quit their jobs and traveled to Moscow in the
expectation of receiving quick permission to leave for the United
States.
   On Friday, a group of 23 U.S. senators and nine House of
Representatives members called for revoking the suspension of
refugee processing begun July 1, which U.S. diplomats in Moscow say
has frozen the applications of about 3,400 people.
   In a letter, the senators told President Reagan: ``This decision
sends a terrible signal to those seeking freedom all over the
world, and could give the Soviets the opportunity to claim that it
is America and not the Soviet Union which is impeding emigration.''
   Last month, the embassy gave permission to a record 2,063
Soviets, 94 percent of them Armenians, to emigrate to the United
States. That was more than in all of fiscal year 1987, which ended
Sept. 30.
   U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock told reporters last week that
processing of the refugees was scheduled to resume on Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 1989 fiscal year, when more funds would become
available.
   But the Saturday statement said that starting Monday, ``the
embassy will interview immediately the approximately 400 applicants
who came to Moscow in the initial few days after July 1 so they can
proceed to Rome for entry processing to the U.S.''
   The mission said it would work with the other 3,000 Soviets ``to
seek every possible means to facilitate their timely departure for
the United States.''

   Hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky has more than his
share of titles, but ``Canada's most eligible bachelor'' won't be
among them after today.
   Canadians have been treating Gretzky's marriage to American
actress Janet Jones as their version of a royal wedding, with the
ceremony, the gifts, the ring and even the bride's background
coming under intense scrutiny.
   The 27-year-old Edmonton Oilers star is regarded as a national
treasure, a Mr. Clean who acts as ambassador-without-portfolio for
the sport he loves. He makes an estimated $2.5 million annually.
   Given his squeaky clean stature, it's not surprising his
Edmonton marriage to an actress from Missouri who posed for the
March 1987 issue of Playboy magazine has set the nation abuzz.
   ``What I can't figure out is why he chose to marry a Playboy
bunny when he could have the pick of the crop,'' complained one
letter to the Edmonton Sun.
   But wedding guest Gordie Howe, a hockey hall of famer, described
the bride as ``OK, if you like them young and beautiful,'' and the
Toronto Star heralded ``the royal wedding of a Canadian prince and
his starlet lady.''
   Canadians have learned all about Miss Jones' former flings with
tennis pro Vitas Gerulaitis and actor Bruce Willis, while Gretzky's
former girlfriend, Vickie Moss, was tracked down in Los Angeles for
comment.
   Rumors got so out of hand that Gretzky intervened to assure
reporters he did not pay more than $200,000 for Miss Jones'
three-carat wedding ring; honeymoon plans do not include Lear jets
and private yachts; and guests will drink Canadian champagne, not
Dom Perignon.
   ``We want it to be as first-class as possible, but it is not a
million-dollar wedding like everyone says. We're from sensible
families,'' said Gretzky, who didn't deny buying his bride a
$207,500 Rolls Royce as a wedding gift.
   Miss Jones, 27, is from Bridgeton, Mo., and has appeared in the
films ``American Anthem,'' ``The Flamingo Kid,'' ``A Chorus Line''
and ``Police Academy 5.''
   To accommodate the 700 guests, the Roman Catholic Church waived
its rules to permit the Anglican groom and Methodist bride to wed
in St. Joseph's Basilica, the city's largest church.
   Miss Jones flew in from Los Angeles with her $40,000 wedding
gown. Her sister, Jeannette, is her maid of honor, while former
Edmonton Oiler goalie Ed Mio is best man.
   The couple met in 1982 when Gretzky was a guest on the TV disco
show, Dance Fever, where Miss Jones was a dancer.
   Gretzky began rewriting the record books after entering the
National Hockey League in 1979.
   Until an injury sidelined him part of last season, he won eight
straight Hart Trophies as the league's most valuable player and was
its leading scorer seven times. With Gretzky back for the playoffs,
the Oilers won their fourth Stanley Cup championship in five years.

   National Guardsmen today patrolled Council
Bluffs, Iowa, after tornadoes ripped through two Missouri River
communities, injuring at least 64 people, damaging more than 100
homes and flipping railroad cars.
   ``It's an absolute miracle no one is dead,'' Council Bluffs City
Councilman Stanley Grote said Friday after thunderstorms packing
tornadoes and wind gusts up to 92 mph slammed into Omaha and its
neighbor across the river.
   Trees up to 48 inches in diameter snapped in Council Bluffs and
others as tall as 100 feet were uprooted at an Omaha golf course.
The twisters also downed power lines, started fires and overturned
rail cars in a two-mile stretch in Council Bluffs.
   Omaha Public Power District and Iowa Power and Light said an
estimated 100,000 residences were without power. Authorities said
crews worked through the night and ``still had a long way to go''
before restoring all power.
   Council Bluffs Mayor Tom Hanafan ordered an overnight curfew to
forestall looting and Guardsmen patrolled the streets.
   More than 2 inches of rain caused street flooding in parts of
Omaha and hail was reported throughout the area.
   In the worst two-mile stretch in Council Bluffs, the tops of
hundreds of trees were sawed off by a twister, sidewalks were
uplifted and roofs were blown off houses.
   There were at least three sightings of tornadoes in the area
Friday afternoon, the National Weather Service said today.
   An Omaha man was in serious condition today with neck and
possible internal injuries after a tree fell on a car he was in.
Another man in the car was in fair condition. Most injuries were
minor, officials at three hospitals said.
   Lightning and high winds knocked at least one radio station off
the air, and the Council Bluffs Nonpareil was forced to use Omaha
World-Herald presses to put out its Saturday edition because of the
power outage in Council Bluffs.
   Exits off Interstate 29 into Council Bluffs were closed late
Friday and the Iowa Highway patrol sealed off the most heavily
damaged area.
   ``We went to the hallway and we were praying very hard.
Emphasize that we were praying real, real hard,'' said Council
Bluffs resident Lu Guzenhauser, who was baby sitting when the storm
hit her westside neighborhood.
   Ms. Guzenhauser and the two children escaped injury even though
part of the tool shed behind her house was hanging from power lines
in the front of her home after the storm. Five blocks away two
houses were destroyed.
   Bonnie Nusser was upstairs with her three children when the
tornado hit their Council Bluffs home.
   Thirty seconds later, the house was destroyed, but the family
was safe under a pile of rubble in the backyard.
   ``We were in the hallway upstairs and the house just started
sliding. I just grabbed for the kids and held on,'' she said. ``I
had two of them with me so the thing I was thinking was `Where's
the third?'
   ``We landed outside in the backyard under a pile of rubble. My
son was under that pile of rubble where the stairs were,'' she
said, pointing to where her home used to be. Denny Nusser, 17,
suffered a cut arm. No one else in the family was hurt.
   ``We found a camera and a tennis racket and a shoe,'' Mrs.
Nusser said. ``I think I'm going to build a bomb shelter.''

<HEAD>Country's Top Executives to Meet on Nagorno-Karabakh Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass reported Saturday that the executive
committee of the Soviet parliament will meet this week. It was
believed the topic of discussion would be the dispute involving
Nagorno-Karabakh, in the Azerbaijan republic.
   Armenians, who want to annex the region to their republic, have
been saying for weeks that they believed the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet would meet Monday. The Tass dispatch was the first
official confirmation that, but the report didn't say what would be
discussed.
   The dispatch was from Stepanakert, the main city in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``The situation in the Nagorno-Karbakh Autonomous Region is
becoming more tense with the approach of July 18, the day when a
meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R. is
to be held,'' the news agency reported.
   Armenians make up more than three-quarters of Nagorno-Karabakh's
160,000 residents. They have said the Presidium session will be
crucial to their decision on whether to continue a general strike
and street rallies pressing their demands for the region's
annexation.
   Tass said a general strike continued and food was in short
supply in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The Delaware-sized region has been part of mostly Moslem
Azerbaijan since 1923. Armenians are mostly Christian.
   Last month, the Armenian parliament endorsed the annexation
demand, but Azerbaijani lawmakers refused to give their consent.
   The Nagorno-Karabakh legislature voted Tuesday to secede from
Azerbaijan and join Armenia, but the Azerbaijan parliament declared
the move illegal.
   Central Communist Party officials ruled out a transfer of
Nagorno-Karabakh in February, but the central government has not
reviewed the matter.
   The issue erupted in violence in February, when riots in the
Azerbaijani city of Sumgait killed 32 people, most of them
Armenians.

   Widows and orphans of assassination
victims led a solemn peace rally Saturday and appealed for an end
to the spate of killings that has gripped this city since May.
   About 1,000 women attended a Mass and joined a march in downtown
Angeles. After the march, they recited the rosary and offered a
``prayer for peace.''
   At least 38 people were killed in Angeles, home of the U.S.-run
Clark Air Base, in May and June. The city is 50 miles north of
Manila.
   Communist gunmen, who killed three Americans near the air base
last year, claimed responsibility for four of the recent killings
but attributed most to government forces and common criminals.
   Saturday's marchers held placards that pleaded for forgiveness
instead of revenge and ``Love, not hate.'' They clutched white
ribbons that organizers said symbolized peace.
   Widows took turns appealing for an end to the violence.
   Erlinda Cura, widow of human rights lawyer Ramos Cura who was
killed last month, said that while her husband's death was tragic,
``his blood will serve as a seed for us and his children to
continue fighting for his aspirations and principles.''
   Marina Tabliga, widow of slain army Sgt. Ric Tabliga, asked
assassins to spare other families, saying ``the suffering we widows
are experiencing is enough.''

   A British brigidier general and a Danish lieutenant
colonel drowned while attempting to rescue several children who
were caught in rough surf off a beach south of Rome, authorities
reported today.
   A spokeman for the NATO Defense College in Rome, where the two
victims were enrolled in a course, identified the officers as Brig.
Gen. Russell Maynard from southern England and Lt. Col. Niels Erik
Thorn of the Danish army.
   Hometowns and ages for both men were not immediately available,
said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   He said the two officers and several colleagues and their
families were having a barbecue on a beach at Fregene, a town about
15 miles from Rome, when the children got caught in the surf.
   Among the youngsters was a child of Maynard, the spokesman said.
   He said lifeguards and members of the beach party pulled the
children safely to shore.
   Funeral arrangements were pending, the spokesman said.
   The 6-month-long course at the defense college runs through
July, he said.

<HEAD>Delegates See Dukakis as Dependable, Honest, Dull, Short</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats on the verge of nominating Michael
Dukakis for president see themselves picking a dependable but dull
fellow who has done well at his current job but lacks some
experience he would need for the new one.
   A handful of them suggest that the 5-foot-8-inch governor of
Massachusetts could use lifts in his shoes.
   Results of an Associated Press survey of delegates to the
Democratic National Convention found that while many give Dukakis
credit for his performance as governor, a roughly equal number are
concerned about his lack of experience in national and
international affairs.
   ``I suspect they (the Republicans) will make much of foreign
policy issues, but I've never seen an election decided by foreign
policy issues,'' said William Winpisinger, a delegate from Maryland
and president of the Machinists union.
   ``What happens at home is what counts, and he's got a good
record on that,'' Winpisinger said.
   More than 1,900 delegates _ about 46 percent of the 4,161 total
_ responded to the opinion survey and 583 gave Dukakis high marks
for his record and experience as governor, his skills as a manager
and his ability to deal with economic issues.
   However, 553 said he is weak in the areas of foreign policy,
national issues and in dealing with Congress.
   One hundred cited Dukakis for his honesty.
   ``And I think that's going to be a big issue in this campaign
... the Reagan administration sleaze factor,'' said Montana state
Rep. Dan Harrington, a Dukakis delegate. ``Dukakis has shown he's
above all that.''
   Asked to name Dukakis' strength, Elana Stampfer, an Oregon
delegate, replied: ``his managerial skills. Everyone thinks that's
boring, but I think it's exciting to have someone who will actually
be able to run government well.''
   ``Boring'' is one of the words that pops up repeatedly in
delegates' assessments of Dukakis.
   Of those responding to the survey, 288 said he was dull or
described his personality as cold, aloof, humorless or arrogant.
   ``How can I say this politely? The one weakness is he is
boring,'' said Gloria Johnson, a Jackson delegate from Maryland.
   ``He lulls his audiences to sleep,'' said Robert Williams, a
Jackson delegate from Oregon. ``You start out listening to him, but
by the middle of his speech, you've forgotten what he's said.''
   It also appears, according to the delegates, that being called a
liberal is more a curse than a compliment.
   Seventy-six classified the liberal label as a weakness, while
just three said it was a strength.
   On a more personal level: ``He's short,'' said Chris Fairchild,
a Dukakis delegate from Michigan. ``I really, honestly think that's
going to be trouble for him. How many presidents do you know that
were short?''
   Becoming a nominee for president of the United States may give
Dukakis a larger-than-life stature.
   ``When I saw him this week, he'd taken on an aura he didn't have
six months ago,'' said Sue Pate, a Dukakis delegate from Texas.
``So you didn't notice him being short.''

<HEAD>Shultz Says Soviet, Chinese Pressure Will Deter Olympic Attacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
said Saturday he is confident that pressure from the Soviet Union
and China will deter North Korea from staging terrorist attacks at
the Olympic Games.
   Shultz, on the seventh stop of a nine-nation Asian tour, also
reaffirmed Washington's commitment to the security of South Korea.
   ``I think everybody will be exerting their influence in a
positive way. I feel that the Olympics will go off in good style,''
Shultz told reporters shortly before landing in the South Korean
capital after leaving Beijing.
   On the eve of Shultz's arrival, the United Nations Command
accused North Korea of trying to undermine the Olympics by making
war threats and ``contriving tensions.''
   ``Your attempts to contrive an atmosphere of danger on the
Korean Peninsula, in a transparent attempt to undermine the
upcoming Seoul Olympics, will not succeed,'' said U.S. Rear Adm.
William T. Pendley, chief UNC delegate to the Military Armistice
Commission.
   Olympic security is one of the issues Shultz is expected to
discuss when he meets President Roh Tae-woo and other government
and opposition leaders this week. U.S.-South Korean trade and
America's continuing military role in South Korea also are slated
for discussion.
   Shultz said that in preparing for the Olympics, the South
Koreans were alert to the placing of surface-to-air missiles within
range of Seoul and the recent introduction of an advanced Soviet
warplane into North Korea.
   According to Washington, the Soviet Union has provided North
Korea with SAM-5 missiles and a small number of advanced MIG-29
jets.
   But Shultz stressed that Moscow has promised that the North
Koreans would not interfere with the Olympic Games. North Korea is
boycotting the games because its demand to be a co-host was
rejected.
   Shultz said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze recently
gave assurances to President Reagan. ``He said flatly something
like, `We know the North Koreans well, and I can assure you that
there will be no _ underline no _ terrorist attacks made during the
Olympics.'''
   Shultz said he had received similar assurances from the Chinese,
who like the Soviets, will compete in the Olympics.
   Local newspapers said Shultz may propose opening a trade
representative office in North Korea on condition that the
communist state promise not to disrupt the Olympics.
   The newspapers, quoting unnamed government sources, said South
Korea would request prior consultations in case the United States
took such action.
   Shultz reaffirmed Washington's commitment to the defense of
South Korea and said U.S.-South Korean relations are ``in excellent
shape.'' The United States has about 42,000 troops in South Korea
under a mutual defense pact.
   ``Our security cooperation remains the bedrock of our
relationship,'' Shultz said. ``Let there be no misunderstanding:
for more than 40 years Americans have been prepared to commit their
lives and their resources to the security of the republic of
Korea.''
   Shultz may run into some criticism in discussing U.S.-South
Korean trade relations. ``Of course there is a certain resentment
here for the push that we are making to open their markets,'' he
said. ``But so be it. We'll keep pushing, because after all we have
our own interests too.''
   He noted that South Korea was America's seventh-largest trading
partner and said ``economic openness, such as a greater market
access for competitive products'' was essential to a healthy global
economy.
   The United States has urged economically booming South Korea to
liberalize its regulations on U.S.imports, including cigarettes,
beef and agricultural commodities, to offset a trade deficit of
about $10 billion.

<TEXT>
   Like Jesse Jackson himself, the
``Rainbow Express'' caravan changed often on the long trip to
Atlanta, running cool and then hot, long stretches of highway
punctuated by fiery speeches in steaming churches.
   As Michael Dukakis and top Democratic officials listened for
words of confrontation or conciliation from Jackson, he rolled
southward for three days from Chicago.
   In a way, the bus trip was a throwback to the days of candidates
barnstorming slowly across the country instead zipping from region
to region in jet airplanes. But there was also the flavor of 1988,
with more than 100 reporters transmitting stories from the caravan
_ stories that showed up within hours or even minutes in newspapers
or on television.
   Friday night, from his Nashville stop, Jackson appeared live on
ABC-TV's ``Nightline.''
   The caravan itself was a wild-card assortment of buses, station
wagons and bristling security vehicles.
   At the head sat Jackson, mainly apart from the hustle and
bustle. He traveled with advisers and his children, allowing
reporters and photographers to join him for 10 minutes or so at a
time, occasionally waving at photographers who pulled alongside in
cars.
   His was the best-appointed bus, equipped with a kitchen,
television, microwave oven and staff area.
   None of the buses was jammed, and on one leg of the trip two
reporters rattled around one of the buses as the only passengers.
Clearly, length of the caravan _ photographed from news helicopters
each time it pulled from a city _ was important.
   The caravan left few ripples as it wound its way to Atlanta.
Construction workers stared curiously and occasionally waved at the
buses festooned with banners and posters. As they entered each
city, small knots of bystanders gawked, but the real crowds waited
in the churches where Jackson held all of his public events.
   It wasn't until Saturday that campaign officials moved to expand
the caravan, hoping to assemble a big motorcade to give Jackson a
horn-honking, crowd-pleasing entry into the convention's host city.
   When announced, the caravan had been billed as a sort of rolling
juggernaut, picking up steam as it headed toward the national
nominating convention and capped with a triumphant arrival in
Atlanta with thousands of supporters picked up along the way.
   All that changed the first night.
   ``We're not picking up passengers,'' Jackson said. ``Because of
travel time, we're not encouraging additional passengers.
   ``This is not Atlanta for show business, this is Atlanta for
serious business,'' said Jackson, as he launched one of the great
rolling media expresses.
   Instead, Jackson spent his time in a complex and subtle
long-distance link with certain nominee Dukakis, a kind of dance
that played itself out as the buses rolled from the inner-city
ghetto of Chicago to the rolling hills of Tennessee.
   For most of the trip, there were about 120 reporters, 20 or 30
assorted backers and a dozen or so delegates _ including Tom
Moynahan, an Indianapolis real estate agent who also happens to be
a delegate for Dukakis.
   ``Let me make my loyalties clear up front,'' he said, adding he
wanted to express appreciation for Jackson registering new
Democratic voters, an important thing for someone running for local
office like Moynahan.
   Moynahan gradually blended into the rolling city. He doggedly
stuck with the group, fighting his way through mobs of reporters to
register at hotels and make his way into churches to hear Jackson
speak.
   His station wagon tailed the convoy and he was a required
interview for reporters searching for a new angle.
   The long, deliberate procession kept the focus squarely on
Jackson, just as Dukakis might have been expected to be moving to
the center of the spotlight.
   At stops along the way, Jackson ran sort of an update service
for reporters on his latest contacts with Democratic leaders.
   But there were also the stops at inner-city churches in several
cities, giving Jackson a chance to shine in his fiery preacher's
role before excited audiences. At such times, the caravan turned
from its insular self.
   In Nashville, thousands gathered to hear Jackson in a tiny
Baptist church that seated only a couple of hundred.
   As crowds pressed against the door and reporters fought their
way through, fire officials abruptly locked the doors, insisting
legal capacity had long since been exceeded.
   Inside the church, a wall of television cameras separated
parishioners from the pulpit, and one of the bigger cheers of the
evening came when church officials announced that television camera
operators couldn't stand on pews and had to lower their cameras.
   The crowd's loyalties were clear when Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore
Jr. was introduced to scattered boos, though he later drew cheers
with talk of defeating ``Reagan, Reaganism and Bush.''
   When he promised to campaign throughout the fall with Jackson
for the ticket of Dukakis and Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the man who
got the No. 2 slot Jackson sought, there ws silence.
   When Jackson said ``I want to win and I want you in,'' the house
came down.

   The Teamsters' election of a veteran ``old
guard'' East Coast leader to succeed Jackie Presser as its
president exposes a major rift in the nation's largest union at a
time of its greatest peril.
   Whatever his faults, the 61-year old Presser, in his five years
as the Teamsters' president, had tried to counter an image of the
nation's largest union as an adjunct of organized crime.
   He launched an aggressive public relations campaign and opened
the union, at least partially, to more public view. He also moved
the Teamsters back into the mainstream of the labor movement,
directing its reaffiliation with the AFL-CIO last October after 30
years of warfare between the two bodies.
   Presser died on July 9, and some see the election this past week
of William J. McCarthy, 69, of Boston, over Presser's handpicked
heir, Secretary-Treasurer Weldon Mathis, as a repudiation of those
efforts. McCarthy was picked by a 9-8 majority among the 17 members
of the Teamsters executive board.
   His victory, according to several sources in the union, was
orchestrated by Teamster power broker Joseph Trerotola of New York,
who at 70 is the most powerful vice president and head of Teamsters
operations in 15 East Coast states.
   ``The old East Coast guys won over the progressives,'' said one
source close to the Teamsters, adding that the battle is likely to
be refought at the Teamsters' next convention in 1991. ``Two years
from now, you're going to start seeing people campaigning like
crazy.''
   Neither Trerotola nor McCarthy has ever been indicted.
   And McCarthy is described by other union leaders in the Boston
area as being stubborn, headstrong and sometimes a maverick _ but
free of ties with known mob leaders.
   ``He's a hard-nosed (expletive),'' said one official with
another union, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ``but he's
clean. Nobody's ever had any words about him and he has a great
rapport with all of the other unions in Boston.''
   Trerotola also is described as ``clean.'' But Trerotola
developed the nickname ``Joe Shrugs'' within the union because he
feared dealing with corruption in some Teamster locals in New York
and New Jersey, according to Steven Brill, author of a 1978
best-selling book on the union, ``The Teamsters.''
   Presser, himself under indictment at the time of his death on
charges of embezzlement and labor racketeering, had pushed Mathis,
62, of Atlanta, as his successor in the event of his death.
   Mathis and Walter Shea, a veteran Teamster bureaucrat who had
directed the union's headquarters staff during the reigns of
Presser and his two predecessors, Roy Williams and Frank
Fitzsimmons, had the closest ties of any of the union's national
leaders with the AFL-CIO.
   Both were instrumental behind the scenes in the Teamsters'
decision last October to reaffiliate with the labor federation,
three decades after being expelled on charges of corruption. And
AFL-CIO officials were known to be enthusiastic about either one of
them succeeding Presser.
   According to sources within the Teamsters, McCarthy and
Trerotola both initially opposed rejoining the AFL-CIO, although
McCarthy said upon his election that he intends ``to do everything
possible to work as a team'' with the federation.
   Spurring McCarthy's victory, according to several sources, was a
belief that Presser's focus on raising the union's political and
public profile as a strategy for fighting the corruption
allegations had backfired.
   As evidence of that, they cite Presser's indictment in 1986 even
though government documents indicate that FBI agents may have
encouraged him to perpetuate a payroll-padding scheme, on which the
charges are based, in their use of him as a government informant.
   And despite Presser's open courtship of the Reagan
administration for five years, the Justice Department just two
weeks ago filed a civil lawsuit seeking to impose a government
trusteeship over the entire union.
   The government's preparation of the suit had been leaked to
reporters a year ago. Hints from prosecutors that other AFL-CIO
unions would be targeted next was a major impetus behind the
Teamsters' reaffiliation last fall.
   Mathis had been considered a shoo-in for succeeding Presser,
particularly after the union's constitution was rewritten in 1986
to name him as interim president instead of Trerotola if Presser
was incapacitated.
   Just before undergoing brain surgery in May, Presser passed
those reins to Mathis, naming him interim president for 120 days.
   However, at about the same time, 64 percent of the voting
rank-and-file members had just cast ballots against the National
Master Freight Agreement, the union's largest contract negotiated
under Mathis' leadership with the interstate trucking industry.
   McCarthy, who openly opposed the contract, said Friday that he
will try to reopen it and ``get the wishes of our membership.''
   But he also indicated a reluctance to allowing the public much
more of a view into the Teamsters' internal decision-making.
   ``I don't think it's any of your business,'' he told reporters
seeking the breakdown of the vote on his election. ``I got enough
votes to become the president.''

   With both expectations and leverage in short
supply, the Reagan administration is weighing new approaches for
dealing with the increasingly defiant leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   Administration officials believe that U.S. ability to influence
events in Nicaragua was drastically reduced following the cutoff of
military aid to the Contra rebels last February. It is now groping
for alternatives, none of which appear promising.
   For lack of other options, the administration has been turning
increasingly to diplomatic action for dealing with the Sandinistas.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz discussed the issue during his
visit to Central America two weeks ago and plans a return trip on
Aug. 1.
   But some administration officials believe that diplomatic
pressure, in the absence of military pressure, will not have any
noticeable impact on the Sandinistas.
   Still, Shultz apparently believes he must continue the struggle
no matter how long the odds. He is attempting to find a way in
which the United States and the four Central American countries
friendly to the United States _ Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras
and Costa Rica _ can devise a common strategy for pushing the
Sandinistas toward democracy.
   President Reagan has expressed support for a new Contra aid bill
introduced by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., but there appears to be
little appetite among Democrats, especially in the House, to take
any action that would jeopardize the tenuous truce in place since
March. The bill calls for $27.1 million in humanitarian aid and $20
million in lethal aid.
   Hostility toward the Sandinistas has grown in the Congress since
the expulsion of eight U.S. diplomats from Managua last week, and
there is now faint hope among Contra aid supporters that this and
other Nicaraguan actions may produce some defections in Congress in
support of the administration.
   Congressional distaste for recent Nicaraguan crackdowns on press
freedoms and civil liberties was demonstrated in lopsided votes in
both houses this past weeks on resolutions condemning the
Sandinistas.
   Despite staggering economic problems, reflected in a four-digit
inflation rate, the Sandinista government remains militarily strong
and its behavior recently has fulfilled the worst fears of
administration officials.
   As officials see it, the lack of military pressure on the
Sandinistas has emboldened them to shelve the tentative steps they
had taken toward creating democracy and to move aggressively
against the U.S. diplomatic presence in Managua.
   Ambassador Richard Melton, who was expelled along with seven
colleagues this past week, believes Nicaraguan authorities took
that action as a means of intimidating opposition leaders who saw
the U.S. diplomatic presence in Managua as a source of
encouragement.
   Under Melton's guidance, the embassy placed high priority on
maintaining contact with and on providing psychological support for
the anti-Sandinista leadership.
   As a further blow to the opposition, the Sandinistas have shut
down an independent newspaper and radio station and arrested more
than 40 persons who participated in an anti-government
demonstration last Sunday.
   Nicaraguan authorities maintain that the two media outlets had
violated the law and that last Sunday's protest at Nandaime turned
violent at the instigation of the protestors.
   According to U.S. officials, the Sandinistas now feel they can
move with impunity against their domestic enemies because the
government has little to fear.
   They believe that the Sandinistas have largely written off the
United States as a potential threat, reasoning that the prospects
for renewed Contra military aid are slim. This is partly because
the administration, now in its waning months and weary from
previous battles, lacks the will to continue the fight with the
same passion as before.
   But Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., echoed the sentiment of many
lawmakers when he said that recent events have enhanced the
prospect of renewed military aid.
   ``I still do not believe that military aid to the Contras is the
best policy,'' he said. ``But if the Sandinistas continue to
reaffirm that they are anti-democratic, if they continue to be
repressive, if they adhere to the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, they
will give us no alternative but to consider refunding the Contras,
and with military aid.''

   Leaders of the seven-nation Warsaw Pact
ended their summit today by calling for a mutual East-West
moratorium on increases in military spending and talks before the
end of the year on reducing conventional arms.
   The Communist allies also signed a statement expressing concern
about the effects of the arms race on the environment.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev departed for Moscow several
hours after the meeting, ending a six-day visit to Poland. Other
Warsaw Pact leaders also were returning home today.
   In a joint communique released at the end of a two-day summit,
Warsaw Pact leaders said they support negotiations with NATO ``on
freezing and reducing military expenditures and on announcing, on
principles of reciprocity, a moratorium on increasing (military
spending) for one to two years.''
   The state-run news agency PAP said the statements signed
Saturday contained ``important new ideas (that) serve to
consolidate positive European and world tendencies in questions of
disarmament and making them irreversible.''
   Deputy Foreign Minister Henryk Jarosek was quoted by PAP as
saying the statement on reducing conventional arms and troops has
``great significance.'' ``The countries of the Warsaw Pact spoke
for starting new disarmament negotiation during 1988,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   Jarosek said at a later news briefing that huge stockpiles of
weapons and massive troop deployments on both sides ``make it
difficult for further improvement in the international climate and
negatively affect socioeconomic development of all states.''
   Jerzy Nowak, another Foreign Ministry official, said the summit
talks were more open that in past Warsaw Pact meetings.
   ``The style is definitely different in the sense of rejecting
some ceremonial approaches and the repeating of long empty formulas
which were used very often in these bodies before,'' he said.
   On Friday, the first day of the summit, Romanian leader Nicolae
Ceausescu urged the other leaders to press for new talks on banning
battlefield nuclear weapons from Europe.
   As Gorbachev and the other East Europe Communist Party chiefs
conferred Friday, Gorbachev's wife Raisa traveled to the former
Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and paid tearful tribute to the 4
million people who died there during World War II.
   Conference host Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland, speaking at
a dinner attended by the leaders Friday, said the East bloc nations
have launched a ``peace offensive.''
   Pact members have recently put forward ``a number of valuable,
original initiatives'' in the area of arms control, he said.
``Their active character and importance were underlined today at
this meeting.''
   Ceausescu, in a dinner toast published by the state-run news
agency PAP, called for new East-West talks on the subject of
tactical nuclear weapons that remain outside the scope of the new
U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap intermediate-range nuclear missiles.
The treaty covers missiles with ranges between 300 and 3,000 miles.
   The treaty was a step toward disarmament, but ``the dangerous
course of events has not yet been radically changed toward detente,
cooperation and peace,'' the Romanian leader said.
   He proposed that ``talks on complete removal of any
shorter-range nuclear weapons from the European continent should be
started as soon as possible,'' along with planned talks this fall
on reducing conventional forces.
   Jaruzelski, whose toast was distributed to reporters, pointed to
proposals that Gorbachev made in a speech Monday to the Polish
Parliament as an example of ``new, long-range thinking.''
   Gorbachev urged a renewed effort to break a deadlock with the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization over reducing conventional
forces in Europe. He suggested a pan-European conference and a
withdrawal of some Warsaw Pact air forces in exchanges for the
West's giving up plans to deploy 72 F-16 fighter-bombers in Italy.
   The proposals already have been rejected by the United States.
   The leaders met in the stately Council of Ministers Palace where
the Treaty of Warsaw setting up the alliance was signed in 1955.
   Other leaders taking part in the summit were Erich Honecker of
East Germany, Todor Zhivkov of Bulgaria, Karoly Grosz of Hungary
and Milos Jakes of Czechoslovakia.

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>

   This is one of a series of periodic reports
compiled by Associated Press bureaus on how the U.S. presidential
election campaign is viewed abroad.

<TEXT>
   Here is some of what newspapers abroad had to say last week on
Gov. Michael Dukakis' choice of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his
Democratic running mate in the November presidential election:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANADA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Montreal Gazette (independent): ``Mr. Dukakis' choice seems
astute, even though he now will have to bend over backward to make
sure Jesse Jackson and his supporters stay on board. Mr. Bentsen
brings quite a dowry to this marriage of convenience. He gives the
prospective Democratic ticket extensive experience in Washington,
something Mr. Dukakis lacks. He is a noted fund-raiser. He may help
Mr. Dukakis attract voters on the right. He brings geographical
balance to the Democratic ticket, and he will give ... George Bush,
who has Texan connections of his own, a fight for that important
state's votes.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Globe and Mail of Toronto (national, independent): ``Mr.
Bentsen was the better choice for a winning ticket. He reassures
conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans that Mr. Dukakis ..
. is not an ideological liberal, and this large group of cross-over
voters is critical to Mr. Dukakis' prospects.
   ``Mr. Jackson is too volatile a personality to be that close to
the presidency, despite his admirable and potent campaign on the
progressive wing of the Democratic Party.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Financial Times (independent): ``Mr. Bentsen brings
indisputable qualifications, if no fire, to the ticket. Eighteen
years a senator, and, never forget, the man who defeated George
Bush to make it to the upper chamber, he has the Washington
experience Mr. Dukakis lacks. ...
   ``The real reason why the lot has fallen on Mr. Bentsen is
because of where he is from. Texas may be a law unto itself but it
is the third largest state of the union, the Democrats must carry
it and the formidable Bensen machine is likely to be more effective
with him on the ticket. ... His mere presence alongside Mr. Dukakis
is explicitly designed to tie Vice President George Bush, a
neo-Texan, down to a part of the country he thought he had in his
pocket and to a state which once rejected him, at the hands of a
man called Bentsen.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Times of London (independent): ``Mr. Dukakis may be tainted
with Massachusetts liberalism, but Mr. Bentsen gives the appearance
of comfortable Southern conservatism.
   ``Mr. Dukakis is accused of haste and brashness; Mr. Bentsen, at
67, has the solid values of age. While Mr. Dukakis has no
experience of national political office, Mr. Bentsen is a skilled
manipulator of the levers of Washington power. Mr. Dukakis is
`ethnic'; Mr. Bentsen is patrician. ...
   ``It is clear that Mr. Dukakis intends to rely on his running
mate for delivering those Southern Democrats who voted for Mr.
Reagan. To that end his reassuring pro-defense and pro-business
attitudes will help. The fact that he is a self-made millionaire
(from insurance) will not hurt. He has always been a stout defender
of oil interests, and that will stand him in good stead in Oklahoma
and Louisiana, where the oil industry has been badly winded by the
price decline.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MEXICO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Excelsior of Mexico City (independent): ``Why choose Bentsen?
In reality, it's a very lucid political maneuver. No candidate from
the Northeast can win a presidential election in the United States
without the support of two fundamental states: Texas and
California. Perhaps with this step by Dukakis, geopolitics might
become more favorable to the luck of the Democrats, or at least the
domination of Texas where Bush has an undeniable weight will be
disputed.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MALAYSIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The New Straits Times of Kuala Lumpur (pro-government):
``Although a conservative, Senator Bentsen is credited with a
strong civil rights record. And although he may have ideological
differences with the main protagonist on the Democratic ticket, he
is said to be politically shrewd and competitive, and he commands a
strong political organization in Texas that can be brought to bear
in the South.
   ``In other words, he can still be an asset to Governor Dukakis
in the crucial presidential campaign.''

   The strong opposition showing in Mexico's
general election demonstrated how badly the Institutional
Revolutionary Party miscalculated the people it has governed for
nearly 60 years.
   The PRI failed to gauge the depth of discontent brewing in a
devastated economy, and it underestimated an increasingly
sophisticated nation.
   Spoiled and overconfident after years of unchallenged rule and
landslide victories _ allegedly padded by fraud _ the PRI was put
on the spot in the July 6 elections.
   Mexicans used their votes to deliver a sharp kick to the party
shins.
   They gave PRI's presidential candidate, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, the smallest margin of victory in party history _ just
over 50 percent _ and forced PRI to give up Senate seats for the
first time.
   The PRI, which has never lost a presidential, gubernatorial or
senate race since it was founded in 1929, suffered unprecedented
losses in Congress, although it kept control of both houses.
   With four Senate seats, however, the leftist opposition now has
a guaranteed forum for the next six years. And both the right and
the left will have a greater voice in the lower house.
   The PRI, although it came out of the elections bruised and
divided, is clearly still running Mexico. Salinas takes office Dec.
1.
   Future elections will reveal the strength, shape and staying
power of the opposition.
   The PRI was created by survivors of the 1910-1921 revolution,
who vowed to bring stability and social and economic justice to
Mexico. But while Mexico changed radically over the decades, the
PRI didn't keep up.
   After World War II, Mexico entered a period of unparalleled
development. Industries, the recently nationalized oil fields and
petrochemical production expanded. Tourism flourished. The economy
grew 5 percent to 6 percent every year from the early 1960s to 1980.
   Only one out of four Mexicans could read and write in 1940. Now
eight out 10 are literate. Forty years ago, almost three-quarters
of the people lived in the countryside. About 60 percent are now
city dwellers.
   Mexico City has become the largest metropolitan area in the
world. The city that was home to 3.1 million people in 1950 grew to
nearly 20 million _ almost a quarter of the nation's estimated 85
million people.
   Sustained post-war progress and the oil boom of the 1970s
created a growing middle class based on the American model.
   The PRI, however, remained a party of power-hungry peasants,
laborers and bureaucrats, an institution run by the sons and
grandsons of its founders.
   The oil boom triggered a wild government spending-and-borrowing
spree and high-level corruption.
   When oil prices fell in 1982, the economy came unraveled.
   Since then, the average Mexican's spending power has been cut in
half. Last year, inflation hit a record 159.2 percent.
   Now, it takes a full day's minimum wage to buy two pounds of
meat. Many families go without.
   The bust left a society of frustrated consumers watching with
envy as television families in trendy clothes enjoy the latest
products, which are out of reach of most Mexicans.
   The public ire grew this year under an economic austerity
program that enabled Mexico to keep up payments on its $104 billion
foreign debt but further eroded Mexicans' buying power.
   The PRI began realizing it was in trouble as the election
approached, but it underestimated how many people would vote
against the system.
   When returns began coming in, stunned party insiders realized
the PRI had lost Mexico City to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate
of a leftist coalition, who talked about social compassion,
national pride and a moratorium on debt payments.
   Cardenas and the rightist opposition candidate, Manuel J.
Clouthier of the National Action Party, or PAN, took almost half
the vote _ even though results may have been distorted by fraud.
   The election left Salinas, the architect of the economic
austerity plan, without a solid mandate for change.
   Throughout the campaign, Salinas insisted he wanted an honest
victory that would give him an undisputed green light to modernize
the party and the economy.
   Instead, his victory was not clean enough or big enough to
silence either the party's traditional faction or the public voices
of economic discontent.
   ``He has a party in shambles, he has no program left, he has no
constituency. All he has is a presidency _ and an empty one at
that,'' said Adolfo Aguilar, a Mexican political analyst and
Carnegie Endowment fellow.
   Salinas will have to tread carefully among his plans to
challenge the bloated bureaucracy, the corrupt unions, the blatant
patronage system, the political bosses and the privileged elite he
has inherited.
   His closest associates say privately that the outcome of the
vote was more credible than in previous Mexican elections, when the
PRI won with huge majorities.
   They also say the sobering result _ a message from the
electorate that the old ways simply are no longer acceptable _
gives them the mandate to unleash reform within the party.
   The strong opposition showing could force Salinas to fashion
economic policies with an eye to the social consequences, and to
their impact on ordinary people.
   ``I think the opposition's fate rests on Cardenas,'' Aguilar
said. ``He has to make people believe that the election was
worthwhile, even if he lost. If Cardenas fails to lead, the PRI
will regain its old confidence.''

   A gang hacked eight bus passengers to
death with sickles Saturday in southern Tamil Nadu state, the
United News of India reported.
   Four people were injured, the news agency said.
   UNI said at least 15 people forced their way onto the bus and
attacked the passengers.
   The killings were believed to be in retaliation for the murder
of a president of a local village council in January, police told
UNI.
   A man identified as Muniyandi, who was accused of planning the
murder of the village leader, and seven of his accomplices were
traveling on the bus when the attack occurred, the news agency said.
   It was not immediately clear if Muniyandi, who uses a single
name, and his associates were among those killed.
   The men were traveling to a local police station, where they
have been required to report periodically since being charged with
the murder.
   The attack occurred near the town of Kumuthi, 300 miles
southwest of the Tamil Nadu state capital, Madras.

   Jesse Jackson said today he hopes to
resolve his differences with Democratic presidential nominee-to-be
Michael Dukakis, but his campaign picked up petitions needed to
place Jackson's name in nomination for vice president.
   Jackson campaign representatives picked up the nominating papers
for both president _ the office for which Jackson has campaigned
all year _ and vice president, the post he wanted after Dukakis
clinched the top spot, a convention official confirmed today.
   The official in the office of the secretary of the convention,
asking that her name not be used, said the representatives picked
up the forms Friday.
   Jackson said later that night that he would not put his name in
nomination for the vice presidency, but left open the possibility
someone else might.
   ``I'm not putting my name into nomination, but if it were to
happen it certainly is an option that would be within the rules of
the convention. It would not be breaking precedent,'' Jackson said
on ABC News' ``Nightline.''
   For anyone to place his name in nomination, a candidate must
sign his approval under party rules.
   ``We should be expected to use every rule that we can to advance
our cause and expand our Democratic Party. I think we're going to
have a lively convention but it should be a wholesome and healthy
one,'' Jackson said on ABC.
   Jackson's convention manager, Ron Brown, today declined comment
about the vice presidential question and would not say if it was
discussed at a late-night meeting of Jackson's top advisers with
the candidate in Nashville, Tenn.
   Top staffers from the two camps were to meet after Jackson's
splashy arrival in Atlanta this afternoon to discuss reaching an
agreement.
   Jackson again said he is not angry at Dukakis for picking Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for vice president, that he wants to negotiate
his role in the party for the fall and beyond.
   ``That is unresolved conflict....I'm simply saying we are not
connected,'' Jackson said. ``I hope within the next few days we
will be connected because we want to win....We must have
partnership and we must be included.''
   He also laid out some of his public demands of Dukakis, while
saying they must be satisfied in private.
   ``I suppose what we are looking at now is where does the
progressive wing fit in the Democratic National Committeee, where
does it fit in the campaign, where does it fit in that circle of
people who will be making decisions about policy and priorities? If
we win, where does it fit in transition?'' he said.
   As he nears Atlanta, Jackson has been reaching out to party
notables, campaigning Friday night in a packed Nashville church
with former rival Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr.
   ``We need the politics of inclusion that Jesse Jackson has
preached all over this country,'' Gore said. ``Jesse Jackson's
campaign is a step toward hope.''
   Rebuffed by Dukakis in his bid to use former President Jimmy
Carter as a mediator, Jackson said he'd called New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, who ``understands the steps that are now necessary.''
   However, Jackson said, ``I have no idea'' what role Cuomo might
be able to play.
   Jackson had suggested that Carter could serve as an intermediary
between the two camps, but Dukakis rejected that idea earlier
Friday.
   Jackson simply shrugged and said ``no comment'' when asked about
Dukakis' stance.
   ``I see this tension we're going through as normal and
healthy,'' Jackson said. ``That should be the purpose of Atlanta,
to move us from battleground to common ground.
   ``At this stage of several previous Democratic conventions, we
were not even at this stage,'' Jackson said.
   With the opening of the Democratic National Convention just days
away, Jackson has made it clear throughout his trip that he's yet
to settle his differences with Dukakis. But at the same time he's
been sending signals he's willing to do so, continuously hinting of
the benefits he can bring to the Democrats next fall.
   ``Matters of substance have not yet been resolved,'' Jackson
said. In fact, he said, stalled platform negotiations haven't
resumed, after being jolted earlier in the week by the naming of
Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as Dukakis' choice for the vice
presidential nomination.
   Brown, Jackson's convention coordinator and chief negotiator
with the Dukakis staff told the Los Angeles Times Friday that
Jackson is insisting he be granted a ``partnership'' in the fall
campaign that includes ``participation in the decision-making
process.''
   If Jackson's objectives are not met, Brown warned that even if
Jackson supports the Democratic ticket, ``Jackson's constituency is
not going to feel motivated to come out and vote for the ticket in
large numbers.''
   ``I have not encouraged or discouraged anyone about what they
should do on Thursday,'' Jackson said, referring to the final day
of the convention when the vice presidential nomination is
scheduled.
   On the other hand, Jackson and Dukakis have talked twice in
recent days, and agreed to a ``diplomatic initiative'' where top
advisers from the two camps meet tonight.

   With both expectations and leverage in short
supply, the Reagan administration is weighing new approaches for
dealing with the increasingly defiant leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   Administration officials believe that U.S. ability to influence
events in Nicaragua was drastically reduced following the cutoff of
military aid to the Contra rebels last February. It is now groping
for alternatives, none of which appear promising.
   For lack of other options, the administration has been turning
increasingly to diplomatic action for dealing with the Sandinistas.
Secretary of State George P. Shultz discussed the issue during his
visit to Central America two weeks ago and plans a return trip on
Aug. 1.
   But some administration officials believe that diplomatic
pressure, in the absence of military pressure, will not have any
noticeable impact on the Sandinistas.
   Still, Shultz apparently believes he must continue the struggle
no matter how long the odds. He is attempting to find a way in
which the United States and the four Central American countries
friendly to the United States _ Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras
and Costa Rica _ can devise a common strategy for pushing the
Sandinistas toward democracy.
   President Reagan has expressed support for a new Contra aid bill
introduced by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., but there appears to be
little appetite among Democrats, especially in the House, to take
any action that would jeopardize the tenuous truce in place since
March. The bill calls for $27.1 million in humanitarian aid and $20
million in lethal aid.
   Hostility toward the Sandinistas has grown in the Congress since
the expulsion of eight U.S. diplomats from Managua last week, and
there is now faint hope among Contra aid supporters that this and
other Nicaraguan actions may produce some defections in Congress in
support of the administration.
   Congressional distaste for recent Nicaraguan crackdowns on press
freedoms and civil liberties was demonstrated in lopsided votes in
both houses this past weeks on resolutions condemning the
Sandinistas.
   Despite staggering economic problems, reflected in a four-digit
inflation rate, the Sandinista government remains militarily strong
and its behavior recently has fulfilled the worst fears of
administration officials.
   As officials see it, the lack of military pressure on the
Sandinistas has emboldened them to shelve the tentative steps they
had taken toward creating democracy and to move aggressively
against the U.S. diplomatic presence in Managua.
   Ambassador Richard Melton, who was expelled along with seven
colleagues this past week, believes Nicaraguan authorities took
that action as a means of intimidating opposition leaders who saw
the U.S. diplomatic presence in Managua as a source of
encouragement.
   Under Melton's guidance, the embassy placed high priority on
maintaining contact with and on providing psychological support for
the anti-Sandinista leadership.
   As a further blow to the opposition, the Sandinistas have shut
down an independent newspaper and radio station and arrested more
than 40 people who participated in an anti-government demonstration
last Sunday.
   Nicaraguan authorities maintain that the two media outlets had
violated the law and that last Sunday's protest at Nandaime turned
violent at the instigation of the protestors.
   According to U.S. officials, the Sandinistas now feel they can
move with impunity against their domestic enemies because the
government has little to fear.
   They believe that the Sandinistas have largely written off the
United States as a threat, reasoning that the prospects for renewed
Contra military aid are slim. This is partly because the
administration, now in its waning months and weary from previous
battles, lacks the will to continue the fight with the same passion
as before.
   But Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., echoed the sentiment of many
lawmakers when he said that recent events have enhanced the
prospect of renewed military aid.
   ``I still do not believe that military aid to the Contras is the
best policy,'' he said. ``But if the Sandinistas continue to
reaffirm that they are anti-democratic, if they continue to be
repressive, if they adhere to the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, they
will give us no alternative but to consider refunding the Contras,
and with military aid.''

<HEAD>City Council Votes To Require Sprinklers In Most High-rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by a fatal fire in California's
tallest building May 4, City Council has voted to require
sprinklers in about 350 high-rises.
   The 13-0 vote Friday applies to older commercial and industrial
buildings exempt from sprinkler requirements enacted in 1974.
   Council members also indicated they would act to require
sprinklers in more than 100 older residential towers, but said that
measure would take time to develop because rent-control laws allow
the costs of sprinklers to be passed on to tenants.
   ``It could translate up to $150-per-month rent increases,'' said
Richard McCaughey, a legislative analyst. ``We don't want to put
little old ladies out on the street.''
   The 62-story First Interstate Bank building was having
sprinklers installed when it caught fire. One person died and 40
were injured in the blaze that gutted 4{ floors. The building was
not subject to the 1974 sprinkler ordinance. Under the new
ordinance, which applies to pre-1974 buildings more than 75 feet
tall, or about seven stories, owners would have three years to
install sprinklers.
   An automatic one-year extension would be granted for buildings
requiring major asbestos removal as part of the installation.
   A bill in the Legislature requiring sprinklers in high-rises
across the state would give owners more time to install the devices.
   Geoff Ely, executive director of the Building Owners and
Managers Association of Los Angeles, said he was disappointed by
the council's action and is now pinning his hopes on the state
legislation.
   Ely said his group isn't trying to stall but wants to make sure
that when the sprinklers are installed they are quality systems put
in by reputable contractors.

   Israeli soldiers shot and wounded three masked
protesters who raised Palestinian flags Saturday in the West Bank
town of Nablus, the army and hospital officials said.
   Scattered protests were reported in other parts of the West Bank
and in Arab east Jerusalem. A 13-year-old boy and a woman were
reported injured.
   The army command said an Israeli patrol saw four masked men in
Nablus raise Palestinian flags and throw stones. The Palestinian
flag is outlawed in Israel and the occupied territories.
   The army said the soldiers were forced to respond with gunfire
and that they wounded three protesters.
   Officials at Nablus' St. Luke Hospital identified two of the
victims as Mohammed Abdallah, 21, who was shot in the abdomen, and
Mohammed Hamir, 19, who was shot in the leg. Doctors at Al Ittihad
Hospital said they treated 21-year-old Mahmoud Al Kasar for a
bullet wound in his leg.
   Since the Palestinian uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, 222 Palestinians and four Israelis have been
killed.
   Troops clamped a four-hour curfew on the Jalazone refugee camp
near the West Bank town of Ramallah, an army spokesman said. He
said the step followed disturbances in the camp.
   Ramallah Hospital officials said they treated Mahmoud Hattab,
13, and Jamil Abu Radaha, 28, after the Jalazone incident. They
said the teen-ager was beaten by soldiers and the woman was hit by
rubber bullets.
   ``I tried to protect Mahmoud, my neighbor, and a soldier pushed
me away and later fired at me,'' a local Palestinian reporter
quoted the woman as saying.
   Palestinian reports said there were more protests in several
villages around Ramallah.
   In the southern part of Jerusalem, a firebomb was hurled at an
Israeli car Friday night, and police arrested two Palestinian
suspects, Israel radio reported. There were no injuries in the
firebombing.
   Police reported several stone-throwing attacks in Arab east
Jerusalem on Saturday and said a window of a police vehicle was
smashed.

<HEAD>Pentagon Probers To Take Close Look at Radar Signals From Iranian
Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon investigators will be taking a close
look at whether the USS Vincennes detected radar signals emanating
from the Iran A300 Airbus that it mistook for an F-14 fighter and
shot down, military and industry sources say.
   Publicly available evidence suggests that the Airbus was not
using its weather or navigational radar, which send out different
signals than radar aboard an F-14 and could easily have been
distinguished by equipment aboard the Vincennes, according to
Pentagon officials.
   ``If an F-14 is using its target acquisition radar, it is a very
specific signal, and one which you can easily identify,'' Pentagon
spokesman Dan Howard told reporters on July 5, two days after the
incident.
   Pentagon and industry sources said it would be common practice
for either an attacking F-14 or an Airbus making the 175-mile run
in clear weather between Bandar Abbas, Iran, and Dubai, in the
United Arab Emirates, not to turn on its radar.
   ``The Iranians know ... when they paint something with their
target illumination radar, that we can detect it and we can
identify the target very specifically from that information,''
Howard said.
   ``It's not necessary to turn a lot of this equipment on if you
know the location already from other sources,'' he said. ``You can
wait until you actually release your ordnance.''
   The absence of a radar signal, therefore, would tell the
Vincennes' officers nothing about the approaching plane, but any
radar signal originating from the Iranian aircraft should have
identified it as civilian or military.
   A computer analysis of electronic data from the Vincennes has
been conducted in the United States and flown to Bahrain, in the
Persian Gulf, where a six-member team headed by Rear Adm. William
M. Fogarty is investigating the incident.
   Pentagon officials have declined to discuss information
uncovered by Fogarty, including whether the Iranian aircraft was
sending out radar signals.
   A device known as a transponder aboard the Airbus was sending
one set of identification signals common to civilian and military
aircraft, as well as a signal unique to warplanes, Howard said.
   And the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., said that it was impossible for a ship to use its own
radar to precisely identify an approaching aircraft, a view shared
by Navy and industry officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The issue of whether the Airbus was emitting radar signals is
quite different, however, and the answer is not likely to be known
publicly until the results of the Fogarty investigation are
released, something that Navy officials now say they do not expect
until early or mid-August.
   The Vincennes, and many other U.S. warships in the gulf, are
equipped with a device known as a SLQ-32, which can distinguish the
``signatures'' of radars. Radars that are used by commercial
airliners are quite different from those used by military aircraft.
   The exact differences are classified, industry and Navy sources
said, but generally military radars are far more powerful, operate
on different frequencies, radiate farther, and ``ping'' objects
more frequently with radio waves than do commercial radars, they
said.
   The SLQ-32, manufactured by Raytheon, Corp. of Massachusetts
``is a little like a fuzz-buster,'' said one industry source. ``It
can spot a highway cop if he has his radar on. But if he doesn't
have his radar on, you won't spot him.''
   The SLQ-32 can be programmed to distinguish the ``signatures''
of various types of radar. And one Navy source said that even if
the device were not programmed to make that distinction, a skilled
operator can tell the difference anyway.
   Howard, in briefing reporters, said that he did not know ``what
the SLQ-32 was saying'' aboard the Vincennes. ``All that stuff is
on the tape and will presumably be examined by the inquiry.''
   The 80 F-14s sold to Iran in the 1970s by the Grumman Corp. of
Long Island, N.Y., were equipped with a radar system known as
Airborne Weapons Guidance 9, or AWG-9, a sophisticated tracking and
targeting device manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Corp. Iran is
thought to have about 15 remaining F-14s capable of flying.
   The F-14 does not carry additional radar systems, which might
send out signals that could be confused with those of an airliner,
according to industry officials.
   The AWG-9 aboard the F-14 includes the most powerful radar
aboard any fighter airplane manufactured in the West, sending out a
10 kilowatt signal, one knowledgeable industry source said. It can
track 24 targets at once at ranges of up to 200 miles, while
scanning for additional targets, and can guide anti-aircraft
missiles to six targets simultaneously.
   The A300 Airbus that was shot down was equipped, when it was
sold to Iran in 1982, with two radars that send out signals that
are different from the AWG-9, according to an Airbus spokesman. The
one radar, a weather radar, was made by Bendix Air Systems Inc. and
the other, a navigational radar, made by a manufacturer that Airbus
was not immediately able to identify.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An auto safety group says it will decide
whether to appeal a court ruling that upholds a government decision
letting automakers put off until 1993 a requirement for passive
safety belts on a car's passenger side if the driver is protected
by an air bag.
   ``Essentially, what the court did is put passenger occupants (of
cars equipped with driver-side air bags) in a position of a
likelihood of harm when the driver will walk away from the crash,''
Joan Claybrook, head of Public Citizen, said Friday.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had agreed to
a request by the Ford Motor Co., that allows continued use of
manual safety belts on the passenger side in cars that have
driver-side air bags.
   The highway safety agency in issuing the ruling last year agreed
with auto industry claims that more time was needed to develop air
bag systems for front-seat passengers.
   Public Citizen, a Washington-based public interest group,
claimed that the ruling postpones passive restraint protection for
car passengers for four years and puts them in additional danger.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals on Friday upheld the NHTSA decision,
throwing out Public Citizen's suit.
   Jeffrey Miller, deputy administrator of NHTSA, called the court
decision ``good news for consumers because air bags will now be
available sooner and in more cars.''
   Miller said the decision creates an incentive for automakers to
make driver-side air bags available while working on developing
systems that protect both drivers and front-seat passengers.
   Ford announced in June it will offer dual driver-passenger bags
on Lincoln Continentals being introduced this fall for the 1989
model year. Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz models have offered
driver-only bags for several years.
   Chrylser Corp said in May it was including driver bags as
standard equipment in six models assembled after May 15 and would
have them on all models by 1990.
   Porsche offers driver-passenger bags on one model, and several
other foreign companies offer bags to protect the driver.
   An air bag is a device that inflates rapidly in an automobile
collision, protecting a driver's head and upper torso, before it
rapidly deflates.
   The Transportation Department several years ago directed
automakers to phase in passive restraints _ either air bags or
belts that automatically wrap around a person entering a car _ with
all cars to be equipped with the devices by the fall of 1989.
   Last year's ruling, which was upheld by the court Friday,
postponed the requirement in the case of front-seat passengers in
any car where the driver is protected by an air bag.

   Republican John Tower, experienced at running
against a Democrat nominated simultaneously for the Senate and the
vice presidency, says Lloyd Bentsen's Texas campaign threatens to
become ``a bottomless pit people throw money in'' _ and a war chest
for the Democrats' national ticket.
   ``I think it's going to really be a tight rope for him (Bentsen)
to walk,'' says Tower, a former senator from Texas. ``It's going to
be pretty tricky business.''
   Tower, now an adviser to all-but-certain Republican presidential
nominee George Bush, says his camp has put lawyers to work on
sifting through campaign finance regulations.
   They will be quick to pounce on any violations of federal
election law that Bentsen makes as he mounts simultaneous campaigns
for vice president and re-election to the Senate, Tower said in an
interview Friday.
   Republicans worry that Bentsen's Senate campaign could become
``a bottomless pit people throw money in and use for the
presidential campaign,'' he said.
   Before being selected by Michael Dukakis as his running mate,
Bentsen had raised more than $5 million for his re-election bid _
more than any other senator.
   He got more money from political action committees than any
Senate candidate seeking election this year _ $1.46 million. By
contrast, Dukakis refuses to accept PAC funds.
   Tower had firsthand experience with a Texas law that allows a
candidate to campaign simultaneously for both offices _ as Bentsen
will do this fall.
   Tower ran against Lyndon B. Johnson for the Senate in 1960.
Johnson was also running as the Democratic nominee for vice
president with John F. Kennedy.
   Johnson won both races and gave up his Senate seat for the vice
presidency. A special election was called and Tower won.
   Although Johnson juggled both campaigns in 1960, Tower says
Bentsen faces some knotty problems because of stricter federal
election spending laws.
   Says one Republican operative: ``It's a mine field he has to
walk through. ... Anytime someone plows new ground you're bound to
dig up a bone.''
   Counters Bentsen: ``They tell me it's been done before in
Texas.''
   Jim Boynton, assistant executive director of the Texas
Democratic Party, said Bentsen is ``one of the most organized
candidates you'll ever run across'' and will now just ``put another
step of organization in place.''
   He said Republican vigilance of Bentsen's finances is prompted
because they ``have to have some way to challenge the senator.''
   Under Texas law, if Bentsen were to abandon his Senate race, the
Democrats could not name a replacement candidate and the seat
automatically would fall into Republican hands.
   It would go to his Republican challenger, Rep. Beau Boulter, a
two-term congressman from Amarillo who complains that Bentsen's
dual candidacies are unfair and unethical.
   Tower sees other problems for Bentsen. Some of the same people
who support Bentsen for Senate also support Bush and Republican
Gov. Bill Clements. Tower calls them ``pragmatic business types.''
   Moreover, Tower said, things have changed since he ran against
Lyndon Johnson.
   ``Taking comfort in the 1960 analogy is taking comfort in a weak
reed indeed,'' he said.
   Texas Republicans in 1960 were barely worthy of the GOP name,
but today they hold the office of governor, a seat in the Senate,
10 in the House and dozens of posts in the legislature and control
the courthouses in the state's two largest counties _ Dallas and
Harris, Tower said.

   Imagine a brash astronaut thumbing his nose
at the space agency and taking an old Mercury spacecraft all the
way to the moon, then claiming it was a mistake, and you get a
glimmer of Douglas ``Wrong Way'' Corrigan's feat 50 years ago.
   ``My compass froze. I guess I flew the wrong way,'' Corrigan
claimed on July 18, 1938, after making a forbidden New
York-to-Dublin flight in a used Curtiss-Robin monoplane on which
he'd spent $900. Plus $90 for gas and oil.
   He has steadfastly maintained he thought he was returning to his
home base of Long Beach, Calif., after federal aviation authorities
denied him permission to fly to Ireland.
   But Corrigan, now 81 and living in Santa Ana, Calif., hinted in
a telephone interview last week that his wrong-way explanation may
change after he flies again to Dublin on Sunday, this time as an
honored guest for three days of ceremonies commemorating his flight.
   ``Maybe this time over in Dublin, I'll tell them another story.
We'll see,'' he said Thursday.
   Corrigan's ``wrong-way'' explanation sounded like pure blarney
at the time _he was made a lifetime member of the Liars Club _ but
America and Ireland loved it.
   He was the overnight guest of the U.S. ambassadors in Dublin and
London. After he returned to New York by ship, with his plane in a
crate, he was given a ticker-tape parade. There was even a meeting
with President Franklin Roosevelt.
   A movie was turned out by RKO Studios,``The Flying Irishman,''
starring Corrigan as himself, and there were magazine articles and
an autobiography, ``That's My Story.'' He estimated he grossed
$85,000 from tours and speeches.
   As punishment for his journey, the Bureau of Air Commerce,
forerunner of the Federal Aviation Administration, suspended
Corrigan from flying for five days. Those five days were served
while he was still aboard ship on the way home.
   Whatever the true story, Corrigan had joined the ranks of his
hero, Charles Lindbergh, and Wiley Post by making a solo, nonstop,
single-engine crossing of the Atlantic.
   He also dispelled the notion that air feats were only for
millionaires and well-financed aviators.
   When Corrigan was 20, he was a woodworker at Ryan Aircraft in
San Diego and helped build Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis for the
1927 New York-to-Paris solo trans-Atlantic flight.
   Corrigan got his pilot's license the next year. He bought a
leather flight jacket just like Lindy's, scraped his money together
and studied navigation.
   He bought his monoplane for $310 in 1931, and spent an
additional $590 modifying it into a long-distance machine. Before
the flight to Ireland, he flew from Long Beach to New York nonstop
in 27 hours on July 7-8.
   Then the Bureau of Air Commerce refused to grant permission for
a trans-Atlantic flight, on grounds his plane, loaded with 330
gallons of gasoline and five gallons of oil, was 55 percent too
heavy for a safe flight.
   Corrigan took off from New York's Floyd Bennett Field on July
17, saying he was headed for Long Beach. He landed at Dublin 28
hours and 13 minutes later, 3,150 miles from New York.
   ``There had been a haze near the ground and when I was 500 feet
high, there was fog below the plane,'' Corrigan once said of his
flight. ``When I started to turn west I noticed the top compass was
not working right, due to the liquid having leaked out. ... There
was another compass down on the floor that I had set to fly a
westerly course, so now I turned the plane until the parallel lines
matched, and flew over the fog.''
   The wrong way.
   He had no radio and his $1 wristwatch stopped. ``The only modern
instrument I had was a turn-and-bank indicator,'' said Corrigan,
who subsisted on fig and chocolate bars and some water during his
flight.
   ``I knew I wasn't in Long Beach when I dropped out of the
overcast over Dublin,'' he said. ``The place was greener and some
of the houses had hay roofs.''
   Corrigan will be the guest of Aer Lingus on Sunday when the
Irish airline takes him to Dublin aboard a Boeing 747.
   ``We offered him a first-class seat, but he said he would prefer
to fly economy,'' said Aer Lingus spokesman Bill Maxwell in Dublin.

<HEAD>Presidential Bid a Family Affair for Dukakis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Democratic Convention Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis' quest for the White House has
been a family affair from the start, with his mother, wife and
children fanning out across the country on his behalf.
   This week the Dukakis clan comes to Atlanta.
   On hand at the Democratic National Convention when Dukakis
accepts the presidential nomination will be a team he proudly
boasts of at virtually every campaign stop: his mother, Euterpe;
his wife, Kitty; her son, John, and their daughters, Andrea and
Kara.
   ``The family has been an enormous wellspring of pride for
Michael,'' said Ira Jackson, a former aide to the Massachusetts
governor and a family friend for 25 years. ``The campaign has been
very healthy for the family and that is a fact that Michael has not
exactly been modest about lately.''
   Joining the immediate family in Atlanta will be another Dukakis
who has received a flood of media attention this year _ Oscar
Award-winning actress Olympia Dukakis, the candidate's cousin.
   John, 30, Kitty's son from a previous marriage, began
campaigning in 1964 for then-state Rep. Michael Dukakis. John was 6.
   Like his parents, he graduated from Brookline High School. He
tried his hand at acting but then went to work in 1985 as an
assistant to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   He married Lisa Thurmond in 1987, and they jointly ran the
southern leg of Dukakis' primary campaign. They are expecting a
child.
   Andrea, 22, is a 1987 graduate of Princeton University, where
she majored in English. She coordinated Iowa field operations for
her father and then headed to Florida to help out there. She will
attend the convention but is taking a summer break from the
campaign to be an intern at a New York publishing house.
   Kara, 19, delayed beginning college for a year to help her
father's 1986 gubernatorial re-election bid. She signed on with his
presidential campaign in May 1987, working in the national
headquarters and taking occasional campaign trips.
   When she entered Brown University in September 1987, Kara
organized a Students for Dukakis chapter on campus and spent school
breaks campaigning. She will return to Brown in the fall.
   Kitty Dukakis, 51, a student and teacher of modern dance for 30
years, was forced off the campaign trail in June to have delicate
spinal surgery to repair a disc condition doctors said might have
been related to her dance career. She is recovering ahead of
schedule.
   Mrs. Dukakis presents strong contrasts with her husband, who is
more conservative in dress and demeanor. But she has been at his
side throughout his career, and has made effective campaign
appearances.
   Most dramatic was her disclosure last year that she had been
addicted to amphetamines for 26 years until receiving treatment in
1982. It has become a powerful part of her campaign anti-drug
message.
   Her father, Harry Ellis Dickson, is associate conductor of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra and an occasional surrogate speaker for
his son-in-law.
   If Dukakis moves to the White House, his wife would be the only
one to join him there. But Dukakis' mother believes his family
would set a good role model for the nation.
   ``Because he grew up in an ethnic family, we kept the old values
of discipline, of respect for older people, of family closeness,''
said the ever-energetic Euterpe Boukis Dukakis, 84, who has
campaigned widely for her son. Her husband, who was a general
practitioner specializing in obstetrics and delivered 3,000 babies
in his career, died in 1979, shortly after Dukakis lost a bid for
re-election.
   In the governor's first term in the mid-1970s, Dukakis' family
life was the subject of jokes among old-time Statehous pols who
made light of the governor's insistence on going home for dinner
and of stories about Dukakis making Sunday breakfast for the wife
and kids.
   John Dukakis fondly recalls dinnertime political talk _ at the
kitchen table where the governor has made many important political
decisions over the years.
   It was there that Dukakis told his wife and John he would run
for president, and it was there that he huddled with his wife and
top aides and decided to tap Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his vice
presidential running mate.
   ``That's where he makes most of his important decisions,
political decisions,'' said Ira Jackson, who in addition to serving
a stint as Dukakis' revenue commissioner also used to babysit his
kids.
   During three terms as governor, Dukakis has endeavored to keep
his family affairs as private as possible. He put off Secret
Service protection for weeks out of concern over the disruptions it
might cause them.
   Although the campaign has forced the Dukakises apart more than
ever before, Mrs. Dukakis believes it has had a positive impact.
   ``When you have a close family situation, my sense is that you
tend to reach out when you are apart,'' she said in a recent
interview. ``In a sense, the campaign has brought us even closer.''

Pipes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When she was young, Stella Pretty
Sounding Flute heard her elders tell of traveling many miles to the
Great Red Pipestone Quarry to dig the soft, red stone they used to
carve their sacred pipes.
   The Dakota Sioux woman journeyed on foot toward the quarry
Saturday with other Sioux seeking return of the site from the
government and protesting the sale of items made from the stone
they believe represents the blood of their ancestors.
   ``I cry because I'm seeing the sacred pipe at rummage sales,''
said Pretty Sounding Flute, who lives in Aberdeen, S.D. ``They say
it's just a trinket.''
   The Indians on Saturday began the last leg of a monthlong,
450-mile walk across South Dakota to the quarry in this city of
11,690, eight miles from the South Dakota border. The quarry is now
the Pipestone National Monument.
   The Sioux group says the sale of souvenir pipes, jewelry and
other items made of pipestone is a desecration.
   Other Indians who make their living from the quarry contend that
trading pipestone is a traditional practice that does not violate
Indian religion.
   The controversy over the quarry stirs deep emotions in the
Indian people and involves issues of Indian land rights, cultural
assimilation and religious freedom.
   Members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe believe the quarry was
illegally taken from them more than 60 years ago by the government.
The tribe's council has asked the government and the Pipestone
Indian Shrine Association, a non-profit organization that helps
market pipestone items, to give up the quarry.
   The council contends that 1858 and 1892 treaties with the
government guaranteed Yankton Sioux rights to the quarry.
   The site was sold to the government in the late 1920s, but the
Yankton Sioux claim the sale was invalid. Congress designated the
site a national monument in 1937.
   Herbert T. Hoover, a University of South Dakota history
professor, said the sale of the land, legal or not, should not
affect the Yankton Sioux's rights to the pipestone, the only major
outcropping of its kind in the country.
   ``The tribe may have given up the land, but you have to
understand that, economically, that tribe had hit rock bottom in
the 1920s,'' he said. ``You can talk about legality all you want,
but you have to talk about morality, too.''
   Hoover said the government payment for the land was nearly
$329,000 or about $150 to each member of the tribe.
   Vince Halvorson, superintendent of the monument, said the
National Park Service has no plans to relinquish the monument or
curtail sale of pipestone items.
   ``I think it's strictly an issue between the two (Indian)
factions,'' Halvorson said. ``As long as there's nothing illegal,
and it's a practice that's been going on since we've been here,
we'll keep on doing what we're doing.''
   The shrine association also has maintained distance from the
dispute. Betty Zorich, the group's business manager, declined
comment on the issue.
   Halvorson said about 130,000 people visit the monument each year
and about 100 people, including craftspeople, earn a living
directly from the quarry. Only Indians can dig at the quarry.
   Chuck Derby, a Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux pipemaker from Pipestone,
said he does not believe selling pipes is a desecration.
   ``Our feeling is that we've been doing this kind of work for
several generations,'' he said. ``We were taught by our elders to
do this. You just can't take a pipe down to the store today and
say, `I want $20 worth of groceries.' You have to exchange the pipe
for money to buy your groceries.''
   Indians involved in the walk said they don't want put other
Indians out of work.
   ``We do not want to close the quarries down,'' said Wesley Hare
Jr., a Yankton Sioux. ``We'd like to see that if they take this
stone, they use it for what it is meant for. That is the basis of
our tribe's spirituality.''

   Soldiers killed two men
believed to be African National Congress guerrillas in a national
park near the Mozambique border, the military said Saturday.
   Spokesman Ian Buck said the men were killed in a remote area of
Kruger National Park on Friday. The shooting occurred near the spot
where two alleged ANC guerrillas were killed in a similar incident
Thursday.
   The ANC is the main black guerrilla group fighting to overthrow
South Africa's white-led government.
   Buck said two suspects escaped into Mozambique in Friday's
confrontation. He said the military suffered no casualties in the
joint army-air force operation in Kruger, South Africa's largest
national park.
   On Saturday, three black men were killed in two separate
attacks, police said in their daily unrest report. The report
covers incidents from the preceding 24 hours.
   Two men were killed and five were injured in black factional
fighting in a township outside the southeastern city of
Pietermaritzburg, police said.
   A bystander was killed when an assailant fired on a security
force vehicle in a township outside Cape Town, police said.
Security forces arrested one man, police said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Will Leave the Convention to Campaign Among Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis intends to use the Democratic
nominating convention to launch his presidential campaign with a
call to end the ``borrow and spend'' prosperity of the Reagan years
that he says masks great uneasiness across America about the future.
   After flying to the convention in Atlanta on Sunday with his
designated running mate, Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis will use
the four-day celebration of his candidacy to dramatize his economic
theme by going beyond the customary convention appearances to
campaign among local residents _ at a factory gate and elsewhere.
   ``That will be the central issue of this campaign, an economic
future that creates good jobs in every part of this country,''
Dukakis said in a pre-convention interview in the governor's office
of the Massachusetts Statehouse.
   After the convention, Dukakis and Bentsen will leave Atlanta
together for what campaign manager Susan Estrich said would be a
coast-to-coast campaign trip with a first stop in Texas.
   That inaugural trip by the new Democratic ticket will include
``a good many rallies, built on the excitement which we think is
going to come out of the convention.''
   Dukakis was spending the hours before his departure trying to
deal with a state budget deficit that offered Republicans an
opportunity to challenge his image as a tough manager who has
balanced state budgets while holding the line on taxes.
   The picture of the nation's economy offered by Dukakis will
contrast sharply with the view put forth by Vice President George
Bush, his certain Republican opponent.
   Republicans cite an unemployment rate that is half what it was
in December 1982 and inflation and interest figures far below what
they were in the final year of the presidency of Democrat Jimmy
Carter.
   ``We can build on the stable, record-setting economic pace of
the Reagan-Bush years, we can continue to pursue peace through
strength, or we can head down a road already traveled,'' said
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas after leading a GOP
delegation to the Democrats' convention city.
   Despite the improving economic statistics, Republican pollster
Richard Wirthlin has said that since December 1986, his monthly
surveys have found a majority of Americans saying the country was
headed in the wrong direction.
   ``There is great uncertainty out there,'' Dukakis said. ``Why
the great uncertainty?
   ``The American people know you can't build a strong economic
future on a credit card. You can't borrow and spend, borrow and
spend, and borrow and spend your way to prosperity.''
   As for the improving economic statistics, Dukakis said, ``Those
numbers, averages mask all kinds of problems.''
   Bentsen refers to a ``Swiss Cheese economy'' in which the
general prosperity is pocked by bad times.
   ``Thirty-two percent unemployment in Starr County, Texas,'' was
an example cited by Dukakis.
   He also blamed Reagan administration antitrust policy for
tolerating ``takeover artists circling all sorts of healthy
companies all over this country. As soon as they make an
acquisition, 600 or 700 people are out in the street, or more. ...
Over a trillion dollars worth of debt which our kids and grandkids
are going to have to pay is no way to run a railroad.''
   Estrich described the convention as ``a time when the
opportunities to communicate through the media are enormous, so
we'll be spending plenty of time trying to take advantage of those
opportunities because in Mike Dukakis we have a candidate who has
just burst onto the national scene.''
   For the first time, say Dukakis aides, the Democrats are
recruiting top talent from the world of commercial advertising to
work with political media experts _ a practice common in GOP
campaigns for years.
   One of the people recruited to help Dukakis is Ed McCabe who was
responsible for the Frank Perdue slogan, ``It takes a tough man to
make a tender chicken.''

   An old lime mine collapsed today,
killing one person and injuring two others, police said. Two others
were missing, including a 1-year-old child, police said.
   At least five persons, all believed to be Danish, were trapped
inside the Timbaek Lime Mine in the northern Jutland peninsula
after the 250-foot ceiling collapsed, a police officer on duty in
Aalborg told The Associated Press. He declined to give his name.
   Rescue workers dug out one person and another was able to crawl
out of the debris, the officer said. Both were were hospitalized
with minor injuries, he said.
   Rescuers found one person dead and searched for the remaining
two under the fallen lime, he said. He said one of the two missing
was a 1-year-old child.
   The cause of the collapse was not known.
   The dismantled mine is 15 miles south of Aalborg. Tourists often
come to the old mine to see a sculpture exhibit and the great
number of bats living there.

   Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson talked about smoothing over
their pre-convention quarrels, but Jackson's forces picked up
nominating petitions that could be used to challenge the selection
of Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic
presidential ticket.
   As Jackson's ``Rainbow Express'' bus caravan rolled toward
Atlanta, it remained anyone's guess whether his supporters would
attempt to disrupt the convention or fall in behind the
Dukakis-Bentsen slate.
   Publicly, Jackson and Dukakis edged away from a confrontation in
Atlanta, with Jackson saying he harbored ``no acrimony or
hostility'' toward the Massachusetts governor.
   However, Jackson campaign representatives picked up the
nominating papers both for president, the position he lost to
Dukakis, and for vice president, the job he wanted as a consolation
prize. Jackson said he would not put his name in nomination for the
vice presidency but left open the possibility that someone else
might.
   ``I'm not putting my name into nomination, but if it were to
happen it certainly is an option that would be within the rules of
the convention. It would not be breaking precedent,'' Jackson said
on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   Dukakis, the certain Democratic presidential nominee, said he
wants Jackson to be a player in party affairs. ``I want him
involved, I want his staff people involved,'' the Massachusetts
governor said in Boston.
   The wrangling between Dukakis and Jackson remained solidly at
center stage just two days before the opening of the party meeting
at the Omni center.
   Putting the best face on developments, Mike McCurry, the
spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said,
``Negotiations between the two campaigns are going very, very well
and that gives us all a great deal of optimism as we prepare for
the start of our convention.''
   He said Paul Kirk, the party's chairman, ``has been involved in
these discussions and asked me to assure all of you things are
going swimmingly.'' He declined to say what was being discussed,
but said actual negotiations over platform differences have not
resumed.
   As Jackson's bus caravan headed toward a welcoming ceremony in
Atlanta this afternoon, Dukakis went to his Statehouse office in
Boston, arriving at 8:30 a.m. to oversee the Legislature's final
work on a fiscal 1989 budget.
   ``We're going to wrap things up,'' Dukakis said, and two hours
later, the Legislature did just that, completing a marathon
23{-hour session.
   Dukakis planned to study the $11.75 billion budget and sign it
in a ceremony Sunday before leaving for the convention. Democratic
and Republican lawmakers said he would have to veto at least $150
million in the package to bring the state's budget into balance.
   For his part, Jackson, the runner-up in the primaries, said his
supporters must be integrated into the party structure.
   ``It means our constituency must be involved in the Democratic
National Committee and in state committees. It means defining roles
for those constituents in the campaign,'' Jackson said. ``If I am
to have responsibility in that campaign, I must have a role
commensurate with that responsibility.''
   Dukakis and Jackson agreed to have their top aides meet in
Atlanta tonight to discuss differences.
   Meanwhile, former President Jimmy Carter toured the convention
center today, surrounded by the noise of hammering and sawing as
workmen put finishing touches on camera platforms and a railing in
front of the speaker's platform.
   Carter played down the likelihood of convention friction
generated by Jackson.
   ``I think he will be adequately included,'' Carter said. ``The
inevitability is that they will work out any differences. We'll
come out of here with a united party.''
   ``I think the conversations yesterday between Dukakis and
Jackson and their staffs show that the problems are being worked
out,'' Carter said.
   While Jackson arrives in Atlanta later today, Dukakis has put
off his arrival until Sunday, the eve of the convention's opening.
Dukakis planned a quick stop in Washington Sunday afternoon to pick
up Bentsen, a senator from Texas, before the two headed on to
Atlanta.
   George Bush, certain to win the Republican nomination to face
Dukakis in the general election, was heading to Wyoming today for a
4{-day fishing trip with his pal and political mentor, James A.
Baker III, who is expected to give up his job as Treasury secretary
to run the Bush campaign.
   Bush does not plan to let the Democrats have the limelight
exclusively next week. The vice president will come out of
seclusion Wednesday and hit the campaign trail, competing for
attention on the final two days of the Democratic convention.
   Differences between Jackson and Dukakis have dominated the
Democrats' pre-convention picture since Dukakis announced Tuesday
that Bentsen would be his running mate. Jackson and his supporters
were infuriated that they learned of Bentsen's selection from
reporters and not from Dukakis.
   However, with the convention fast approaching, the words of
anger were losing their edge on Friday.
   ``We simply cannot win without each other,'' Jackson said at a
news conference in Louisville, Ky. ``We can only win with each
other. It is in our distinct advantage to find common ground.''
   Jckson, whose staff had broken off negotiations with Dukakis'
aides, called the governor on the telephone, saying later the two
have no ``acrimony and hostility'' but only policy matters to
resolve.
   ``I see the tension we're going through as normal and healthy,''
Jackson said.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was just one man touring the hall Saturday
where 11,000 will gather for the Democratic National Convention,
but the crush of press squeezing through the small passageways in
the arena was a bad omen for next week.
   ``Don't push!'', ``Get out of the way!'' and other less
printable exclamations echoed across the floor of the Omni on
Saturday as former President Jimmy Carter was trailed by about 40
reporters and camera operators.
   Dan Lee, assistant executive officer of the convention, took the
Georgia native on a tour of the facility that will host the first
national convention in his home state.
   Carter strolled across the convention floor, where delegate
seats are so tightly packed together that some people had to turn
sideways to walk between the rows. Talking to reporters as he went,
Carter stood at the podium where he will speak on Monday night. A
wire rope ladder reaching to the ceiling dangled behind him.
   The former president, who spends some time now working on
refurbishing homes for poor Americans, talked with the carpenters
who are hammering together a last-minute addition to the podium, a
low walkway just off the floor.
   Rosalynn Carter choose to stay away from the crush from the
start.
   As the tour of the floor ended, the former president looked
around and said, ``Has anybody seen my wife?''

   A critically ill Soviet mathematician who fought
for nine years to emigrate to the United States for medical
treatement arrived here with his wife Saturday aboard U.S.
industrialist Armand Hammer's private jet.
   Benjamin Charny, 50, whose emigration had been blocked by Soviet
officials who claimed he was privy to state secrets, was met at
Logan International Airport by family members and U.S. political
figures who worked for his release.
   ``I can tell you that I'm infinitely grateful to Mr. Hammer that
brought me to you as a magician in a fairy tale,'' Charny said.
   Hammer, who said he had appealed directly to Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev on Charny's behalf, said, ``This has been a
difficult case. I feel it has been a privilege for me to assist.''
   ``I think it's another example of the improving relations
between our countries,'' said the 89-year-old chairman of
Occidental Petroleum Corp. Hammer's friendly ties to the Soviet
Union go back to Vladimir Lenin.
   Charny and his wife Yadviga, 52, a metallurgist, plan to rejoin
their daughter, Anna Charny-Blank, who lives in Brookline. His
younger brother, Leon, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology
doctoral student, lives in Needham.
   Charny, a mathematician who from 1966 to 1971 helped calculate
the re-entry orbits of Soviet space probes sent to the moon and
Mars, lost his job in 1977 when he applied for an exit visa.
   During the U.S-Soviet summit in Moscow last May, Charny met with
President Reagan during a gathering of prominent refuseniks at the
American embassy.
   Charny underwent surgery for a cancerous tumor on his back and
has what is believed to be a benign tumor on his neck that must be
removed. He recently suffered a heart attack.
   In 1986, the New England Medical Center offered Charny free
treatment.
   Charny's release resolves one of the best-known refusenik cases.
   Beginning last year, Soviet officials increased Jewish
emigration and have granted most well-known refuseniks exit visas.
But Jewish activists assert thousands who have not attracted
western media attention remain behind.
   Among those who met Charny on his arrival were U.S. Sens. Edward
M. Kennedy and John Kerry, D-Mass., and Kitty Dukakis, the wife of
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.
   During the first five months of 1988, the Intergovernmental
Committee for Migration in Geneva reported, 4,574 Jews have been
allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union.
   More than 8,000 Jews were allowed to leave last year, a sharp
increase from previous years but far below the peak of more than
51,000 in 1979.

   The Democratic National Convention could provide
a golden opportunity for Massachusetts Democrats interested in
succeeding Michael Dukakis as governor.
   Without doubt, ``politicians will be politicking at a
convention,'' Rep. Chester G. Atkins, chairman of the state party
and head of the state's convention delegation, said when asked if
there would be gubernatorial maneuvering this week.
   If Dukakis wins the presidency, Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy would
take over and would be running as the incumbent in the next regular
election, in 1990. Dukakis hasn't said whether he would seek a new
term that year if he should lose the presidential race.
   Atkins said lobbying this week will be ``very, very subtle.''
   ``I think you'll see quiet diplomacy,'' said the two-term
congressman, who until recently was himself considering running for
governor to replace Dukakis. ``People first and foremost want to do
what they can to get Dukakis elected.''
   ``Secondly, this is a very, very sophisticated audience you're
dealing with. They're not unaware of all the rituals of political
courtship. And anybody who goes into the courtship ritual outside
of the mating season'' won't be well received, Atkins said in a
pre-convention interview last week.
   The most-mentioned Democrats for the office will all be here for
the convention.
   Lt. Gov. Murphy and Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn are both
delegates. Attorney General James Shannon is here as a member of
the Rules Committee. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, son of the late
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, has no official convention role, but he
will be in town for an event with Martin Luther King III.
   Early polls show Murphy, Kennedy and Flynn close to each other,
with Shannon and Atkins in single digits. Atkins ruled out a
gubernatorial run last month, in part to show House leaders he was
serious about wanting an open seat on the House Appropriations
Committee. Kennedy, a freshman, is fighting for the same seat.

   Two prisoners were at large today
after six inmates escaped during a jail riot in northern England,
the British Home Office said. Four were captured before dawn.
   Police in Doncaster, 150 miles north of London, said about 200
police officers were called to the mimumum-security Lindholme jail
to help guards when about 90 of the 880 convicts began smashing
furniture in their cells and starting fires Friday night.
   The Home Office, the government department in charge of prisons,
earlier said four prisoners were at large, but later corrected
itself, saying only two were still on the run.
   Home Office spokesman Colin Seabrook said six of the prison's
seven wings, including the hospital, kitchen, recreation area and
prison shop, were damaged but much of the damage was superficial.
   He said 46 inmates thought to have been involved in the
disturbances were handed over to police before being sent to other
prisons. The 828 remaining prisoners were still at Lindholme and he
said there were adequate facilities available to feed and house
them.
   Prison service reinforcements, including guard dog teams, and
police encircled the prison to prevent more escapes and sealed a
breach in the steel-mesh fence around the facility.
   Other officers manned roadblocks and searched the area in
darkness and heavy rain looking for the two prisoners still on the
run.
   The two were identified as Ian Hook, 23, serving a 30-month
sentence for robbery and Kevin McLaughan, also 23, serving an
18-month sentence for assault, theft and handling stolen goods.
Neither was considered dangerous, police said.
   One prisoner was hospitalized with a serious back injury
received in the violence, the Home Office said.
   Home Secretary Douglas Hurd asked Gordon Lake, deputy director
general of the prison service, to extend his inquiry into a jail
riot at Haverigg in Cumbria last month to include Lindholme.
   A Home Office official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that unlike other disturbances in British prisons in recent years,
no guards were taken hostage by the prisoners and nobody else was
reported injured.

<HEAD>It's A Summer Bachelor Party On Round Island _ For Walruses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN FOSDICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROUND ISLAND, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This mist-shrouded island 13 miles
off southwest Alaska is a haven every summer for thousands of bull
walruses, but the noise of civilization may be driving them away.
   The puffing, snorting, hissing mammals heave their two tons of
bulk from the Bering Sea and poke their way with their huge tusks
into the crowd, each seeking a spot to rest between seven- to
10-day feeding expeditions. Their favored places for hauling
themselves out of the water are called haulouts.
   The Pacific walruses here and in lesser numbers at the six other
islands of the Walrus Islands State Game Sanctuary are partly
protected by the weather and the location, which make this a
difficult and expensive place to visit.
   The nearest town is 33 miles by charter boat. Summer weather is
characterized by wind, rain and high waves that make approach by
floatplane or small boat hazardous.
   But with increased commercial bottomfishing and the prospect of
oil exploration and development in salmon-rich Bristol Bay, all
that isolation and privacy may fade, and that has some professional
walrus watchers concerned.
   ``Walrus are pretty sensitive to disturbance,'' said Lloyd
Lowry, a marine mammal specialist with the Alaska Department of
Fish and Game in Fairbanks.
   ``There's more than a little concern that the noise caused by
the fishery has influenced the haulout. People on the island say
they sometimes can hear the radios on the bridges of the boats.''
   The game technicians on Round Island this summer, Polly Hessing
and Judy Brandt, said they counted as many as 180 boats in the area
during a peak fishing period in May.
   Although the vessels were outside the two-mile limit around the
sanctuary, they made enough noise to force the women to close the
windows in their cabin so they could sleep.
   The walrus population on Round Island varies considerably from
year to year.
   ``In the mid-1970s, we had as many as 15,000 animals there,''
said Ken Taylor, a state biologist in Dillingham. ``In the last two
years, the herd has gone down. It was 4,400 last year and about
4,500 now. The difficult thing is there are so many reasons for the
numbers to go up and down.''
   Changes in the weather, variations in the food chain and
increased noise are believed to affect the number of walruses
summering on Round Island.
   ``Two years does not a trend make, but we are becoming
concerned,'' Lowry said. ``Walrus are fairly traditional about
where they haul out. So are sea lions. They (walrus) came back from
virtually no animals in the '40s, to peak counts in the late '70s.
   ``But there are several other places they could go and we don't
know if the herd is simply splitting up or what it's doing.''
   While the males are piled up on beaches as far south as Kodiak
Island and Yakutat Bay, the females and their young remain with the
pack ice north of the Bering Strait and into the Arctic Ocean.
   ``We've got a lot of haulouts on the Alaska coast that are empty
now and I think because of boat traffic,'' said Taylor.
   Thirty permits a day are available for people wishing to visit
Round Island. Access is restricted to a narrow corridor fronting a
grassy campground.
   Although walruses get top billing, the treeless island also
supports nearly 450,000 seabirds, primarily common murres,
black-legged kittiwakes, cormorants, parakeet auklets, horned and
tufted puffins and gulls. Red fox are unafraid of people and often
share trails with campers.
   The Pacific walrus herd is believed to comprise some 234,000
animals, a return to its 18th century levels after commercial
hunting severely depleted its numbers.
   Taylor said the Soviet Union is more protective of its walrus
herd.
   ``On the Soviet coast, aircraft are held to 10,000-foot minimums
and boats restricted to 16 miles,'' he said. ``It may be because of
those more severe restrictions that more Pacific walruses are
hauling out there.''

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's oil minister appealed to
oil-producing countries Saturday to lower their output to bolster
collapsing oil prices.
   Gholamreza Aqazadeh singled out Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates in chastising members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries for ignoring an agreement on
production restraints.
   ``Oil producing countries, whether members of OPEC or not, have
to arrive at an understanding among themselves,'' Aqazadeh said in
an interview carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``Countries which place obstacles in the way of this objective
would be responsible for the deteriorating situation on the oil
market,'' he said in the interview, monitored in Nicosia.
   Oil prices dropped in recent weeks to their lowest levels since
1986, when they fell to about $8 per barrel. Crude oil from the
gulf state of Dubai was selling for $12.40 a barrel Thursday, down
from $12.50 the day before.
   In two meetings this year, the 13 OPEC members failed to reach a
consensus on new production quotas to stop prices from falling.
They agreed last month in Vienna to extend current quotas until the
end of 1988.
   Iran depends heavily on its oil production to finance its nearly
8-year-old war with Iraq.

<HEAD>Transportation Board Chairman May Be Victim of Presidential

<TEXT>
   The renomination of Jim Burnett as chairman of
the National Transportation Safety Board has bogged down in the
Senate in what Burnett's supporters say is an effort to replace him
with a Democrat after the presidential elections.
   Burnett, an outspoken former Arkansas judge, was renominated by
President Reagan last April 19 for a fourth term as chairman of the
NTSB, which investigates airline accidents and other aviation
safety issues.
   But the Senate Commerce Committee has yet to schedule a hearing
on the nomination and Burnett's current two-year term ends August
13. Should he not win Senate confirmation by then, the board's vice
chairman automatically assumes the chairmanship temporarily.
   ``There's nothing scheduled (on the Burnett case) at least in
the next few weeks,'' said Emelio Pardo, a spokesman for the
Commerce Committee. He said the full committee is waiting for its
aviation subcommittee to make its views known on the nomination.
   But committee sources say that relations between Burnett and
Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., the chairman of the aviation
subcommittee, have soured in recent months. Burnett publicly
opposed legislation pushed by Ford that calls for the Federal
Aviation Administration to be made independent of the
Transportation Department.
   ``He is not in Burnett's corner and he's not alone,'' said Jim
Fleming administrative assistant to Ford when asked about the
Kentucky senator's views of Burnett.
   Fleming said consideration of presidential nominations is a
matter for the full committee and not a subcommittee.
   If the Senate does not act on Burnett and Michael Dukakis wins
the presidential election in November, a Democrat likely would be
nominated for the post.
   Ironically, many Democratic members of the Senate Commerce
Committee came to Burnett's aid two years ago when his renomination
by the Reagan administration for a time was put into doubt because
of reported opposition from Elizabeth Dole, who was then
transportation secretary.
   In May 1986, the White House allowed Burnett's tenure as
chairman to run out and did not renominate him until July after
pressure from some members of Congress, including some of the
senators who now are cool toward his renomination.
   If not confirmed as chairman, Burnett is likely to remain on the
board at least until the November election. He was active in
Arkansas Republican Party politics and worked in several George
Bush campaigns. Should Bush win the election, he likely would
renominate Burnett next year.
   Burnett, 40, has been a member of the NTSB since 1981. He often
has won praise from Congress for his frank assessments of aviation
safety and criticism of the FAA's ability to monitor air traffic
growth and the airlines.
   In the spring of 1987, Burnett attracted widespread attention by
suggesting that the FAA was allowing air traffic growth to exceed
the capabilities of air traffic controllers. He suggested the
number of commercial flights in some section of the country be
curtailed.
   Before coming to Washington in 1981, Burnett was a judge in Van
Buren and Damascus, Ark., and a special associate justice of the
Arkansas Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Call For Plain English Instead of Honorable Titles In Commons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislative tradition of addressing friends and
foes as ``honorable'' gentlemen and ladies has come under attack
from opposition lawmakers who want their colleagues to speak
``plain English.''
   Three left-wing members of the Labor Party submitted a motion in
the House of Commons on Friday challenging the ``archaic'' forms of
address and urging members to use surnames.
   The motion said the use of names will be especially important
when the 650-member House of Commons allows television cameras to
film debates for the first time as part of a six-month experiment
starting in October.
   By tradition, only the Speaker of the Commons is allowed to
address members by their names. The rest of the members must use
various ``honorable'' forms of address, depending on the person.
   Members of the same party are ``honorable friends.'' Opponents
are ``honorable gentlemen'' or ``honorable ladies.''
   Members of the Privy Council, who serve as senior advisers to
Queen Elizabeth II, are ``right honorable'' gentlemen or ladies.
Members who are Queen's Counselors, the most senior lawyers, are
``honorable and learned,'' and those with distinguished military
service are ``honorable and gallant.''
   John Hughes, one of the Labor lawmakers who sponsored the
motion, said, ``The way things are now done, people watching
television wouldn't have the faintest idea what is going on and who
is being referred to. We should call each other by our real names.''
   But Conservative lawmakers denounced the idea as ``claptrap,''
arguing that without such courtesies, civilized debate in the
Commons would disappear.
   ``This is one of the fascinations of the place and would appeal
to TV viewers as it does to everyone else,'' said Conservative John
Browne.
   Motions in Parliament almost never are debated and serve mainly
as expressions of opinion or forms of pressure. This one is likely
to be referred to a house committee that will check how its
traditions should be modernized for television coverage.
   In the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament
whose proceedings have been televised for several years, peers
still address each other as the ``noble lord'' or ``noble lady.''

   U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence, who underwent
double lung transplant in May, left the hospital in a car festooned
with balloons and ``Just Married'' signs.
   The 60-year-old Republican congressman, a widower, married
37-year-old Debbie Williams of Lexington, S.C., in his hospital
room July 3.
   Spence was discharged Friday from the University of Mississippi
Medical Center, where he received the lungs of an 18-year-old Texas
accident victim May 6. Spence had suffered from severe emphysema.
   The 18-year House veteran said at a news conference he will do
all he can in Congress to encourage organ donation and increase
public awareness of transplant programs.
   He promised to hit the campaign trail hard in September and said
he didn't believe his health should be an issue in his race against
Democrat Jim Leventis.
   Spence said he gave a razzing to nurses who constantly told him
to ``breathe through your nose now, and breathe deep.'' He had
become accustomed to breathing through his mouth because of his
deteriorated lungs.
   ``It's difficult to get used to psychologically ... I try not to
be a pill,'' he said.

   President Reagan, using his weekly radio
speech for a blast at the Democratic economic record, charged today
that party leaders gathering for their convention in Atlanta ``want
to take America back to the failed policies of the past.''
   Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, speaking in response for the Democrats,
said it's in economic matters where the Reagan administration has
left the country weakest.
   Reagan said, ``Before we came to Washington, our economy was in
a mess.'' He said his administration has produced the longest
period of peacetime economic growth in American history.
   ``We cut tax rates, pared back regulations, limited the growth
of government spending, and we did all this to get government out
of the way so that individuals and enterprises had incentives to
grow, to invest, to innovate, to create jobs,'' the president said.
   ``It's ironic,'' Reagan said, ``that just as countries around
the world are adopting the same pro-growth policies our
administration put in place, so many in the Democratic Party want
to go in the opposite direction.''
   ``Today, we face an historic opportunity, a chance to remove the
fear of the boom and bust cycle once and for all, replacing it with
consistent low-tax, limited-government policies,'' he said.
   Reagan said he believed many rank-and-file Democrats would
support this, but added, ``Sadly the leaders in charge of the
convention will want to take America back to the failed policies of
the past.''
   The president urged his listeners, as they watch the Democratic
convention on television next week, to ask: ``Is the Democratic
party, is its nominee for president going to keep taxes low and
government growth under control, or are they going to go back to
the very policies that could wreck our economy again?''
   Harkin, in his radio response, said Democrats in Atlanta will be
sending out the message: ``Let's repair the damage and bring
integrity and competence back to government.''
   ``Today the greatest threat to our national security is not
military _ it's economic. Yet, that's where this administration has
left us the weakest,'' Harkin said.
   He accused Reagan of setting the ship of state adrift and also
criticized Vice President George Bush for avoiding responsibility.
   ``The captain's been asleep at the wheel, and his first mate
doesn't seem to ever be on deck when decisions are made,'' Harkin
said.

   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader has come
home again. But the mayor wishes he'd mind his own business and
stay in Washington.
   ``You know, Ralph Nader is not the king of Winsted,'' said Mayor
James D. O'Meara.
   The two men have battled for the past two years over a school
that Nader and his family attended.
   Nader led a drive to save and renovate the big, red brick
building built in 1900. O'Meara wanted the Mary P. Hinsdale School
flattened because of structural problems and replaced with a modern
structure.
   The mayor won, with the backing of a majority of the voters, and
demolition began July 6.
   That prompted Nader to launch an investigation by his Public
Interest Research Group into how Winsted decides issues of great
public interest.
   Nader said he had been planning for some time to investigate
ways in which ``governments obstruct citizen participation,'' and
decided last month that there was no better place to start than his
hometown.
   ``There's a bipartisan agreement in Winsted that historically
the town has not been governed well, that the planning process has
been poor,'' he said.
   The battle to save the school was highly emotional and led to
numerous public hearings, a petition drive and a court battle.
Nader and his supporters sought and lost two referendums, the last
one by a 2-1 margin in May.
   The school was located around the corner from the Nader family
home. Nader, 54, was a student there from 1939 to 1943. Another
graduate was David Halberstam, the author and journalist.
   Nader and his sister, Claire Nader, who is still a Winsted
resident, sought to have the school protected under state and
national historic preservation regulations, but that was rejected
because a portion of the school was torn down in 1950 when a wing
was added.
   They argued that renovation would have been cheaper than
demolition. A week before demolition began the city rejected their
bid to rent the school for $85,000 a year. Winsted plans a $7.8
million, one-story school at the site.
   ``Nader's problem is that he's highly personalized this thing,''
the 45-year-old mayor said. ``He ought to come up and take a
barometer of the people's attitudes in this town about what he's
trying to do.
   ``I'm a political, elected official. I'm a lifelong resident and
have lived here 90 percent of my life, and I think I've got a good
feel for what people want. I mean, he's been gone for 37 years.''
   Nader said his study should be ready by fall and he hopes it
will make Winsted ``a more progressive, better place to live,'' and
provide lessons for other small towns.
   O'Meara believes Nader's study is ``plain, unadulterated
nonsense.''
   ``This town has functioned for 200 years without Ralph Nader,
and it will continue to function,'' the mayor said. ``It's just
sour grapes over the fact that the voters have voted twice to
demolish a school building that his family opposed.''

   A pilot who testified against
convicted cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas was sentenced to
seven years in prison despite his help in that and three other
investigations.
   Andrew Richard Barnes, 32, a British subject who lives in
Spinnerstown, Pa., was described by prosecutors as important in
obtaining Lehder's conviction, and instrumental in helping
investigate a heroin ring, a Philadelphia organized crime family
and allegedly corrupt Bahamian officials. Barnes was sentenced
Thursday.
   He testified in March and April that he smuggled 3 tons of
cocaine for Lehder from Colombia to the Bahamas, and from the
Bahamas to the United States, in 1978 and 1980. He said he flew an
additional 14 loads of marijuana and one of cocaine for others
after breaking with Lehder.
   Barnes pleaded guilty in a secret court proceeding during
Lehder's seven-month trial.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade With South Africa May Be Leveling Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese trade with South Africa appears to be
leveling off, relieving some of Japan's embarrassment at having
become its largest trading partner.
   Before 1987, the United States did the most business with South
Africa, which has been condemned internationally for the apartheid
race policy that preserves power for the 5 million whites and
denies the 26 million blacks a voice in national affairs.
   Finance Ministry figures released Tuesday showed two-way trade
was down for the second consecutive month because of a sharp
decline in imports, but exports to South Africa remained strong.
   As other countries imposed sanctions on South Africa to protest
apartheid and saw their trade figures shrink, Japan let its
companies fill the gap and has been criticized for doing so.
   Some Japanese newspapers said trade was not really declining,
but Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda told reporters
Thursday they should concentrate on yen-based trade figures rather
than those expressed in dollars.
   In dollars, two-way trade was up 13.3 percent to $2.2 billion
for the first six months of 1988, compared with the same 1987
period, but in yen the value dropped 3 percent to 272 billion, with
the decline starting in April.
   ``We do expect that the new trend after April will continue as
such,'' Matsuda said.
   Japan also renewed its call on South Africa to release Nelson
Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress,
Matsuda announced.
   In addition, he said Japan has gone beyond most Western
countries in breaking diplomatic ties with South Africa and
prohibiting direct investment.
   Japan's bilateral trade with South Africa also has declined for
the past two months when expressed in dollars. The $325 million of
trade in June was 14.5 percent below June 1987, the Finance
Ministry reported. The decline was largely attributed to imports,
which plunged 26.6 percent to $158.1 million in June from a year
ago.
   Exports continued growing, though not as rapidly as six months
ago. In June, Japan exported $166.9 million worth of goods to South
Africa, 1.4 percent more than a year ago. But for the first six
months of this year, exports soared 45.3 percent to $1.14 billion,
according to the Finance Ministry's customs clearance statistics.
   In 1987, Japan's trade with South Africa totaled $4.27 billion,
a 19 percent increase from the previous year that proved
embarrassing.
   Foreign Minister Susuke Uno asked Japanese business leaders
early this year to reduce the trade and suggested the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry coordinate a guideline for
Japanese companies to follow.
   The powerful Federation of Economic Organizations, known as
Keidanren, which consists of some 1,000 major Japanese
corporations, said the Keidanren is not in a position to control
its members' business activities.
   Analysts attributed the recent decline in imports to decisions
by several supermarket chains and department stores to stop selling
South African products.

   An American lawyer said Friday he will
try to have lawsuits involving the Piper Alpha oil platform
explosion and fire heard in a Texas court.
   Benton Musslewhite of Houston told a news conference in Aberdeen
total settlements in the world's worst oilfield disaster could
reach $1 billion.
   He did not say whether he he would handle cases for relatives of
the 166 men killed when the North Sea oil rig was engulfed by
flames July 6.
   The platform, with 230 men aboard, was operated by the Los
Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   Musslewhite said damages against oil companies need to be
punitive so the companies will say ``we can't afford not to be safe
or we will be put out of business.''
   Workers from Texas troubleshooter Paul ``Red'' Adair's
organization continued efforts to cap five of the platform's 36
wellheads that still were burning, Occidental said in a statement.
   It said work to clear debris from the tilting platform continues
when weather permits and drilling of a relief shaft has begun.
   Occidental said one more body was recovered from the sea,
bringing to the number found to 26. Ten survivors remained in
hospitals, the statement said.

Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A woman who claimed to be talk show host
David Letterman's wife Friday was found incompetent a second time
to stand trial on charges she broke into the comedian's home and
stole his car.
   Norwalk Superior Court Judge James Bingham ordered Margaret Ray,
36, to undergo six months of psychiatric treatment in the state
hospital, where she has been a patient for the past several weeks.
   New Canaan police allege Ray broke into Letterman's home and
lived there for several days in May before stealing his car.
   Authorities became suspicious and arrested Ray when she and her
3-year-old son drove up to a Lincoln Tunnel toll booth in
Letterman's Porsche but couldn't pay the $3 toll. She told police
she was Letterman's wife and the boy was their son.
   Letterman asked police to drop the charges and she was released
from a Hudson County, N.J., jail three days later.
   Ray allegedly returned to Letterman's house that day, and police
said they found her eating canned pineapple and writing what she
said were scripts for Letterman's show.
   The charges were reinstated and Ray faces two counts of
second-degree burglary and one count of first-degree larceny.
   The judge ruled last month that Ray wasn't competent to stand
trial because she could understand the charges but was unable to
assist in her defense.
   Friday's hearing was granted to allow time for another
psychiatric examination of Ray, who objected to a first report that
described her as delusional.
   Psychiatrist Sander H. Fogle told the judge Friday he believed
Ray couldn't assist an attorney in defending herself against the
charges.
   The judge scheduled another hearing Oct. 14 to reconsider his
competency finding.
   Ray is being held and treated at the Fairfield Hills Hospital.

   Leftist rebels virtually
paralyzed the nation's roads Friday with threats to attack any
vehicles found on them.
   Almost no traffic moved in the capital city or in the streets of
other major cities. All bus service was suspended.
   Army officials announced increased patrols on major
thoroughfares.
   The clandestine Radio Venceremos broadcast the traffic ban
Thursday and said it would last indefinitely. It said the action
was a protest of what it called President Jose Napoleon Duarte's
repression of the working classes.
   It also said guerrilla commanders have been ordered to increase
sabotage of electric power facilities.
   Such tactics are common in the guerrilla campaign that began
late in 1979. About 65,000 people, most of them civilians, have
been killed in the civil war.

   Angola and Mozambique signed an
agreement Friday providing for closer cooperation between their

the official Angolan news agency Angop said.
   The report monitored in Lisbon said the Angolan defense
minister, Gen. Pedro Maria Tonha, and his Mozambican counterpart
Gen. Alberto Chipande, signed the accord in the Luanda, capital of
Angola.
   Both countries gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and
their Marxist governments are battling anti-communist guerrillas.
   An estimated 50,000 Cuban military personnel are in Angola,
helping the government fight rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola who are backed by South Africa and the
United States.
   Mozambique accuses South Africa of supporting guerrillas of the
Mozambique National Resistance despite a non-aggression pact
between the two countries. South Africa has denied the allegation.
   The Angop report gave no further details of the planned military
cooperation.

<HEAD>Carmakers Can Delay Installing Passive Belts if Driver Has Air Bag</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court on Friday upheld the
government's decision that allows automakers to postpone until 1993
a requirement for passive safety belts on a car's passenger side if
the driver is protected by an air bag.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last year
agreed to a request by the Ford Motor Co., that allows continued
use of manual safety belts on the passenger side in cars that have
driver-side air bags.
   The ruling was challenged by Public Citizen, a Washington-based
public interest group, which claimed that the ruling postpones
passive restraint protection for car passengers for four years and
puts them in additional danger.
   But the U.S. Court of Appeals on Friday upheld the NHTSA
decision, throwing out Public Citizen's suit.
   Joan Claybrook, head of Public Citizen, said no decision has
been made on whether to appeal the ruling.
   ``Essentially, what the court did is put passenger occupants (of
cars equipped with driver-side air bags) in a position of a
likelihood of harm when the driver will walk away from the crash,''
Ms. Claybrook said.
   Jeffrey Miller, deputy administrator of NHTSA, called the court
decision ``good news for consumers because air bags will now be
available sooner and in more cars.''
   The highway safety agency in issuing the ruling last year agreed
with auto industry claims that more time was needed to develop air
bag systems for front-seat passengers.
   Miller said the decision creates an incentive for automakers to
make driver-side air bags available while working on developing
systems that protect both drivers and front-seat passengers.
   An air bag is a device that inflates rapidly in an automobile
collision, protecting a driver's head and upper torso, before it
rapidly deflates.
   The Transportation Department several years ago directed
automakers to phase in passive restraints _ either air bags or
belts that automatically wrap around a person entering a car _ with
all cars to be equipped with the devices by the fall of 1989.
   Last year's ruling, which was upheld by the court Friday,
postponed the requirement in the case of front-seat passengers in
any car where the driver is protected by an air bag.

<HEAD>Southern African leaders say apartheid doomed to fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of nine black-ruled nations in
southern Africa ended a conference Friday with a call on South
Africa to concede that its policy of apartheid ``is doomed to
failure.''
   The one-day meeting was held to determine ways for the nine
countries to reduce their economic dependence on South Africa.
   Quett Masire, president of Botswana and chairman of the South
African Development Coordination Conference, said in the keynote
address: ``The promise of political independence is progressively
turning into a nightmare.''
   He said the high population growth in the area was causing
unemployment and preventing economic gains by the conference
members _ Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
   Two other speakers, President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and
Prime Minister Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, accused South Africa of
trying to undermine its neighbors and hamper their quest for
economic self-reliance.
   ``Lasting peace will continue to elude our region until
apartheid comes to an end in South Africa,'' Mugabe said. He urged
the black-ruled nations to continue upgrading ports, highways and
rail lines to reduce the volume of traffic going through South
Africa.
   Under South Africa's laws and customs, apartheid establishes a
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate residential districts, schools and health
services.
   Oliver Tambo, president of the African National Congress, was
among several ANC officials attending the meeting. The ANC is the
main guerrilla movement fighting white domination in South Africa.
   Masire spoke of South African ``terrorist activities'' but his
speech dealt primarily with economic issues.
   The international trade system ``exposes us to
ever-deteriorating terms of trade and makes us the perennial
objects of charity,'' he said, and unless the system changes ``our
existence as self-respecting nations is in serious jeopardy.''
   He appealed for increased coordination of economic policies and
a strengthening of regional trade ties.
   Others attending the conference were presidents Kenneth Kaunda
of Zambia and Ali Hassan Mwini of Tanzania and Prime Minister Sotja
Dlamini of Swaziland. Angola, Malawi and Lesotho were represented
by Cabinet ministers.
   ANC spokesman Thabo Mbeki said in Maputo his organization was
concernd about bombings of civilian targets in South Africa and
some of the 29 bombs that have exploded in public places this year
may be ``deliberate enemy provocation.''
   South African police have blamed the ANC for the bombings.
   ``We ourselves are puzzled about these bombs which seem to be
directed against civilians,'' Mbeki told the Mozambican national
news agency AIM.
   He said civilians will be hurt in the growing conflict but
``none of our units operating inside the country have reported
having been involved in any of these operations.''
   Mbeki said the ANC policy of striking at army and police
installations has not changed, and does not include attacking
civilians ``be they black or white.''
   Police blame the bombings for 15 deaths and say 112 people have
been wounded. Six black civilians and three white civilians were
killed, two mixed-race babies perished when their mother gave birth
prematurely and four black men died when explosives they were
carrying blew up, according to police.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Malawi, a small and poor republic in
southeastern Africa, will get the first easy loan under a new plan
set up by the International Monetary Fund, it was announced Friday.
   Malawi will pay interest of just 0.5 percent a year on the $72.5
million loan and can use the proceeds to buy foreign goods and to
help pay old debts.
   The country's 7.4 million people earned an average of $160 each
in 1986, the last year for which estimates were available. Since
1965, income had been growing at a rate of just 1.5 percent a year
and life expectancy was 45 years.
   Malawi already owes the fund the equivalent of $99 million out
of a total debt that had reached $1.1 billion in 1986. It will have
5{ years before it needs to start paying back the new loan, with
repayment to be completed within 15{ years.
   It is the first loan from what the fund calls its Enhanced
Structural Adjustment Facility, intended to help the poorest
countries, especially those in Africa. The borrowing government
must promise to make some basic changes in its policies in order to
get the loan.
   Malawi is promising to cut its government deficit and the
deficit of government-owned industries in an effort to curb
inflation. It also is trying to promote private business.

<TEXT>
   A pilot who was stranded in Lake
Michigan 26 hours emerged from his ordeal Friday with little more
than hunger pangs and a headache.
   Michael J. Edison, 43, of St. Paul, Minn., was spotted about 8
a.m. inside his floating single-engine Cessna 206 by the crew of
The Steelhead, a Michigan Department of Natural Resources research
boat.
   ``He said he'd been there about 24 hours, so he was mighty happy
to see us,'' said Dave Johnson, a DNR district fish biologist.
   The plane, which was equipped with pontoons, was about seven
miles northwest of South Haven and about two miles offshore, U.S.
Coast Guard officials said. The plane sustained only minor damage.
   When the aircraft hit the lake, a life raft apparently hit
Edison from behind and he lost consciousness for most of the night,
Johnson said.
   He declined medical attention, and was in good condition except
for a bump on his head, Coast Guard officials said.
   Edison, an insurance executive and experienced pilot, was flying
from Grand Rapids to St. Paul when air traffic controllers in
Minneapolis lost radar contact with the plane at 5:50 a.m. EDT
Thursday. Just before the plane disappeared from radar, Edison
reported oil pressure trouble.
   ``He was getting low on oil pressure and then did something to
the throttle and the engine surged,'' said Mort Edelstein,
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Chicago.
   ``He decided to make a water landing but did not radio his
position. The waves were high and the nose tucked under the
water,'' Edelstein said. Coast Guard officials estimated waves at 2
feet to 3 feet.
   After regaining consciousness, Edison tried to lie down because
he felt sick and accidentally tore out radio wires with his knee,
Edelstein said.
   ``To top it all off, he didn't have a wristwatch so he didn't
know what time it was,'' Edelstein said. Edison also didn't have
any food.
   At dawn, Edison fired up the plane and tried to taxi to shore,
which was in sight, Edelstein said. ``At that moment, he saw the
DNR boat and they towed him in.''
   After his plane was towed to the Coast Guard station at South
Haven, with Edison steering it, he spoke with FAA officials by
telephone. He declined to speak with media.
   ``We know this is a miracle,'' Edison's wife, Bonnie, told the
St. Paul Pioneer Dispatch after hearing that her husband was safe.
``There were hundreds of people praying for him.''

<TEXT>
   An anti-terrorist squad shot and killed a
mentally disturbed man Friday after he wounded one person and
sprayed gunfire from a rooftop, police said.
   Two police officers were later attacked and injured by the
sniper's relatives, who were enraged by the killing, Israel army
radio said.
   A witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the sniper
was killed after a brief gun battle with police.
   Authorities said the sniper was shot at a staircase of the
two-story home when he pointed his loaded M-16 assault rifle at the
police, authorities said.
   Israel army radio identified the sniper as Motti Aharon.
   It quoted family members as saying they had persuaded Aharon to
come down after they rushed to the scene. The report said family
members, angered by the killing, hurled stones at reporters and
attacked police officers, injuring two. It gave no details of their
injuries.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Rafi Levy told reporters at the scene
that the five-hour crisis started when the assailant, a 34-year-old
man armed with an M-16 and two magazines of ammunition, barricaded
himself on the roof of the home.
   He said residents of the house, in a poor Jewish neighborhood
known as Katamon-G, were evacuated.
   Dozens of police and emergency medical vehicles sealed off the
area, and police sharpshooters took positions on surrounding
rooftops.
   Police psychologists were also called in to try to negotiate
with the sniper, who demanded a helicoper, food, and cigarettes.
   Levy said the sniper had a history of mental disturbances and
was ``known to the police, but not as a criminal.''
   He said the man, who is divorced, had ended contacts with his
family two years ago but went to the house Friday to visit his
father.
   He said the sniper apparently obtained his weapon in the army,
where he was doing reserve service.
   Witnesses said the man fired several rounds of automatic fire.
   Levy said the gunman fired a round in the building's courtyard
and wounded a 50-year-old neighbor. The injured man, who was not
identified, told reporters the sniper ``demanded money and then
started shooting.''
   One witness told The Associated Press he saw the sniper
``dressed in a khaki T-shirt and running around on the roof like a
madman.''
   Mayor Teddy Kollek, who also went to the scene, said before the
killing that he felt sorry for the assailant. ``A poor man, a
psychopath, and look what's happening: fire brigade, police,
ambulances,'' he said.
   Police tried to persuade the man to come down. They later held
negotiations from a neighboring building.

sometime this year with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I have already met Mr. Gorbachev four times,'' Mitterrand said
Thursday in a televised interview marking Bastille Day. ``We will
certainly meet this year, in 1988, and we have the intention to
maintain meetings at a regular rhythm.''
   The president said he would approve any proposals by Gorbachev
which aim at balancing East-West conventional forces. ``Anything
which does not head exactly in that direction and leads us into
interminable discussions without results, I would not accept.''
   Mitterrand said earlier in the week that a Gorbachev proposal
for pan-European talks on conventional arms was ``interesting.''

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders of Serbia, the
nation's largest republic, exchanged barbed comments with their
counterparts in two provinces Friday in a clash over ethnic rights
and governmental autonomy.
   Each side avowed that Yugoslavia's late leader, Josip Broz Tito,
would have backed its position.
   Serbian officials said leaders of the autonomous provinces of
Vojvodina and Kosovo were exercising more autonomy than the
constitution provides.
   The provincial officials retorted that Serbia was trying to
limit their autonomy by pressing for radical constitutional changes.
   They traded charges at a marathon, 21-hour meeting of the
Serbian Central Committee that ended Friday.
   The Yugoslav constitution, adopted in 1974 under Tito, the
father of communist Yugoslavia, granted wide autonomy to the six
often fractious republics and two provinces. Although it remained
communist, Yugoslavia broke from the Soviet bloc in 1948.
   ``It is clear that we have to stop (all attacks) on the 1974
constitution, because those charges represent attacks on Tito's
work,'' said Bajram Gasi, a Central Committee member from Kosovo.
   However, Danilo Markovic, a delegate from Serbia, said Tito
himself would have changed the constitution.
   ``We cannot say that we will not change anything just because it
was adopted when Tito was alive,'' Markovic said.
   The document is widely blamed for the country's political and
economic crisis. Yugoslavia is faced with Europe's highest rate of
inflation at 175 percent, a $21 billion foreign debt, falling
standards of living and growing labor unrest.
   The Serbian dispute also revolves around a longstanding ethnic
struggle.
   The Serbian Communist Party says the present constitution
prevents it from exercising its rights and authority in the two
provinces. It says it is kept from imposing tough measures against
what it terms extremist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
   Ethnic Albanians rioted there in 1981, demanding a separate
republic. At least nine people were killed and 250 injured.
   According to official news reports, about 30,000 Serbs and
Montenegrins have emigrated from Kosovo since then, claiming
discrimination by ethnic Albanians making up about 85 percent of
the population.
   Inspired by support from Serbian leaders, about 700 Serbs and
Montenegrins from Kosovo demonstrated last Saturday in Novi Sad,
capital of Vojvodina. They demanded that the two provinces reunite
with Serbia.

   An East German espionage agent who
was an expert in breaking codes has defected to West Germany, the
Bild newspaper reported Friday.
   It did not identify the man but said he defected in June.
   ``This is a major blow to East German counterespionage,'' Bild
quoted an unidentified West German security source as saying. It
reported the source said, ``The man knew all the tricks in breaking
our codes. Now we are armed with enough information to change our
codes accordingly.''
   Government security officials in the federal capital of Bonn
confirmed that an employee from the East German Security Ministry
had defected but declined comment on Bild's report of the man being
an expert in codes.
   The officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said the defector could provide ``useful information.''

<TEXT>
   Chinese-Soviet trade rose by nearly a third in
the first half of this year over the same period last year, an
official report said Friday. The increase reflected improving
relations between the two communist countries.
   The Xinhua News Agency said China sold the Soviets $670 million
worth of goods and imported $627 million worth from January to June
in the largely barter trade.
   It said the two-way trade was up 32 percent over January-June
1987. The agency predicted continued growth.
   China has refused to normalize political relations with Moscow,
which have been chilly since an ideological split in the 1960s.
China says the Soviets must first reduce their troop presence at
the border and persuade Vietnam to withdraw its soldiers from
Cambodia.
   However, the two countries have steadily increased cultural,
trade and other non-political exchanges during the 1980s.
   Xinhua said the Soviets largely buy agricultural products and
raw materials from China, including corn, soybeans and meat.
   Mechanical products, from refrigerators to locomotives, make up
30 percent of China's purchases from the Soviet Union, with the
rest of the purchases consisting of timber, steel, fertilizer and
raw materials.

<TEXT>
   The nation's ruling party picked longtime
President Kenneth Kaunda on Friday as its only candidate for
presidential elections this year.
   The influential southern African leader has come under
increasing criticism this year for his handling of the nation's
deepening economic crisis. Zambia, like many countries on the
continent, is plagued by heavy foreign debt and severe poverty.
   However, Kaunda will stand unopposed for a sixth four-year term
as leader of the country and of the ruling United National
Independence Party, its secretary-general, Grey Zulu, said at a
news conference in the capital.
   Zulu said 6,000 party officials from around Zambia will convene
in Kabwe, 70 miles north of the capital, from Aug. 18-23 to vote on
Kaunda for party president.
   After election as party president, Kaunda is required by the
constitution to win a majority of at least two thirds of the votes
cast in subsequent national presidential elections. The later
elections are not yet scheduled.
   Since 1964, Kaunda has been challenged once for the presidency.
In 1973, he was opposed by veteran politicians Harry Nkumbula and
Simon Kapwepwe, whose campaigns foundered when party officials
elected Kaunda by general acclamation.

<HEAD>Parents Visit Abandoned Baby; Father To Request Immediate Custody</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATALINA ORTIZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parents of a baby girl left at birth in
the restroom of an airliner visited the hospitalized infant Friday,
and the father promised to fight for custody.
   Christina Marie Locasto, charged with abandoning the infant
after secretly giving birth Wednesday, and her husband, Louis, saw
and held the baby for the first time.
   The parents decided to name the brown-haired, blue-eyed baby
Alyssa Frances, attorneys said. Nurses at Mills Memorial Hospital
in San Mateo, where the child was listed in good condition Friday,
had named her Elizabeth.
   ``We are going to request in court Monday that the child be
released to him as its father, and there are no charges against
him,'' said Vicki Yeley, attorney for Louis Locasto, at a news
conference following the visit.
   But social workers, citing Mrs. Locasto's actions, said they
would seek to have the baby kept out of the family's custody.
   The child was found crying, swathed in bloody towels, beneath a
sink on the United Airlines DC-10 on Wednesday shortly after the
plane landed at San Francisco International Airport on a flight
from Newark, N.J.
   Investigators believe the newborn had been there for six hours,
since shortly before the plane took off at Newark. Mrs. Locasto,
24, of New York City surrendered early Thursday after authorities
traced her name from the passenger list.
   Mrs. Locasto was charged with felony child endangerment and was
released after posting $50,000 bail late Thursday.
   Her husband, who was with her on the flight, was not charged.
Her family was apparently unaware that she was pregnant, officials
said.
   Although both parents visited with the baby Friday, only the
father attended the news conference. Locasto, the owner of a
limousine service, did not speak, deferring to his lawyer.
   Yeley noted that the family has two other daughters, ages 18
months and 6 years, and said the father is very upset. On Thursday,
Mrs. Locasto's attorney, John L. Williams, described her in similar
terms, saying she was ``very remorseful, very distraught.''
   The child is currently in the custody of the San Mateo County's
Children's Protective Services. A hearing is set for Monday in
juvenile court to determine whether to continue the county's
temporary custody; permanent custody will be decided later.
   In court papers filed with the county Juvenile Court, social
workers asked to retain custody for another 10 days, until a
hearing to examine Mrs. Locasto's actions during the flight.
   Both Locastos plan to attend Monday's closed custody hearing,
according to their attorneys.
   Detectives said Friday that Mrs. Locasto expressed no interest
in the infant after her arrest.
   ``She never has said one thing about the kid. ... She never
asked how it was,'' said Sheriff's Sgt. Bob Morse. But he said she
admitted giving birth to the child and putting her under the sink.
   Flight attendants told investigators that as the jetliner crew
was preparing for takeoff from Newark, a female passenger asked to
use the bathroom. The flight was delayed for a half-hour as flight
attendants knocked on the restroom door, urging the woman to come
out so the trip could begin.
   The woman finally emerged and rejoined her husband and children,
investigators said. Flight attendants found the bathroom splattered
with blood, but sealed it off in the belief the woman had an
extreme case of diarrhea. It remained locked until after the plane
landed.
   The Locastos left the airplane with other passengers, and a
cleaning crew found the infant about 20 minutes later.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who announced on Monday
his resignation as head of the Cambodian resistance coalition, will
visit Japan as scheduled in August, according to news reports
Saturday.
   In a message to Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno, Sihanouk said he
would like to visit Japan as planned despite earlier reports he had
canceled the visit, according to the economic daily Nihon Keizai
Shimbun. It gave no attribution for its report.
   Sihanouk is due to come to Japan Aug. 8 for a four-day visit.
   Conflicting reports arose about Sihanouk's plans after he
resigned as president of the Cambodian guerrilla coalition _ an
alliance of his followers, anti-communists and the radical Khmer
Rouge (Red Cambodians).
   In his resignation he accused the Khmer Rouge of attacking his
supporters.
   Sihlanouk was deposed as head of state in March 1970 and the
monarchy was abolished later that year.
   The Khmer Rouge gained power in the spring of 1975, defeating
the U.S.-backed government, and Cambodians by the hundreds of
thousands were killed under its harsh policies. Vietnam invaded
Camdodia in December 1978, ousted the Khmer Rouge and established
another communist government.
   Foreign Ministry officials contacted by The Associated Press
said that after Sihanouk resigned from the coalition Japan extended
again the invitation for his visit but did not receive a formal
reply.
   Sihanouk is expected to meet Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and
Uno to discuss Cambodian peace talks, the Kyodo News Service
reported.
   Other reports carried in the news media said Sihanouk decided to
go ahead with his visit to Japan in support of Uno's call for free
elections in Cambodia under the surveillance of an international
monitoring group. Uno also has offered to provide Japanese aid to
finance a neutral peacekeeping force in Cambodia.

   An American group and two Turkish
companies agreed Friday to form a company to produce multiple
launch rocket systems in this NATO-member country.
   The LTV Missiles and Electronic Group of Dallas, Texas, ENKA
Holding of Turkey and the state-owned Turkish Machine and Chemistry
Industry will hold respectively 51 percent, 35 percent and 14
percent of the shares in the company, officials said.
   Financing for the project will be worked out later and will
involve credit from the U.S. side of the venture, a Defense
Ministry spokesman said.
   A total of 180 rocket systems are to be co-produced in Turkey.
The project will cost an estimated $1 billion over 10 years,
Defense Minister Ercan Vuralhan said at the signing ceremony. He
said it will bring technological skills to Turkey and will have
export potential.
   Production of rocket systems is part of a Turkish plan to
modernize the country's armed forces, the largest in NATO after
those of the United States.
   Under the plan Turkey has started co-producing F-16 fighter
jets. Recently a California company, the Food Machinery Corp.,
signed a $1 billion contract to manufacture armored combat vehicles
in Turkey.

<TEXT>
   Peronists elected a populist who
favors a partial moratorium on foreign debt to face the governing
party candidate in next year's presidential elections, final
returns showed Friday.
   The returns from the first Peronist Party primary in four
decades, held a week ago, gave an upset victory to provincial Gov.
Carlos Menem with 54 percent of the vote.
   His opponent, Peronist Party President Antonio Cafiero, took 46
percent.
   The principal presidential opponent of Menem, the 53-year-old
governor of the mountainous western province of La Rioja, will be
Cordoba provincial Gov. Eduardo Angeloz of the governing Radical
Civic Union Party.
   Angeloz, 57, was the only Radical party governor re-elected in
last September's gubernatorial races. The Peronists, overcoming
nationwide electoral losses in 1983 and 1985, routed the Radicals
to win 17 of the 22 governor's seats.
   Menem was elected the Peronist standard-bearer by 1.6 million
card-carrying Justicialist Party members, more commonly known as
Peronists for founder President Gen. Juan Peron.
   A populist, Menem appeals especially to union members and the
lower class. However, he also beat Cafiero on his home turf,
populous Buenos Aires Province.
   Menem favors a moratorium on the interest portion of Argentina's
$55 billion foreign debt, the third largest in the developing world.
   President Raul Alfonsin, elected in 1983 to end a nearly
eight-year military dictatorship, by law cannot run for re-election.
   His term expires in December 1989. Presidential elections are
tentatively set for May or June of that year.

<TEXT>
   Limits on withdrawals from bank
checking accounts will be eased in another reduction of
restrictions that were imposed after most banks were closed in
March, the Banking Commission announced Friday.
   It said that beginning Monday customers will be allowed to
withdraw up to 50 percent of the balance that they had in their
checking accounts as of March 3, but with a maximum withdrawal of
$50,000.
   The remaining amount in checking accounts may be transferred to
savings or fixed-term deposits under the new regulations.
   On March 3, the government closed 67 of the country's 117 banks
after a run on deposits brought about by the political crisis
involving Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the head of Panama's Defense
Forces and dominant force in the civilian government. The banks
that were closed were licensed to conduct both local and
international business.
   They were allowed to reopen May 9 and on July 4 the withdrawal
limit from checking accounts was increased from 25 percent to 40
percent of the balance and the maximum from $10,000 to $20,000.
   A $50-dollar-per-month maximum on withdrawals from savings
accounts remains in effect.
   People began scrambling to withdraw their funds from banks on
Feb. 26 after Noriega deposed President Eric Arturo Delvalle, the
day after Delvalle had tried to fire the general. Noriega was
indicted in February by federal grand juries in Florida on charges
of drug trafficking and the U.S. government subsequently imposed
economic sanctions against Panama.
   A U.S. freeze on $50 million of Panamanian government money left
the National Bank of Panama, a commercial and central bank, unable
to cover the large withdrawals.

   A jury in the second trial stemming from the
Howard Beach racial attack convicted three defendants of
misdemeanor riot charges Friday but acquitted a fourth young man.
   The verdict came several hours after the jury had said it was
deadlocked, prompting the government to offer a plea bargain
granting the defendants youthful offender status and probation,
according to sources on both sides of the case.
   The offer was rejected, and the jury then returned a split
verdict in which the three were acquitted of first-degree riot, a
felony that carries a maximum sentence of four years, but convicted
of second-degree riot, punishable by up to a year in prison.
   ``To the day I die, I'll know I did the right thing,'' said
William Bollander referring to his decision to reject the plea
bargain.
   John Saggese, 20, who was found innocent, said, ``I prayed. I
had my hand on this the whole time,'' displaying a small religious
object.
   Saggese said he told his friends and co-defendants Bollander,
Thomas Farino and James Povinelli, all 18, ``I'm sorry.''
   ``It should have been the same for them,'' he said.
   All three were convicted in the Dec. 20, 1986, attack by a white
gang on three blacks in the Howard Beach section of Queens. Felony
riot or first-degree riot involves ``tumultuous and violent
conduct'' by a group of more than 10 people. Misdemeanor or
second-degree riot involves such conduct by a group of more than
four people.
   On Thursday, a separate jury in the trial cleared Thomas
Gucciardo, 19, of attempted murder, assault and riot charges. The
jury foreman said the defendant not been positively identified.
   Todd D. Greenberg, an attorney for Bollander, said the three who
were convicted will file an appeal immediately after their Sept. 14
sentencing. But Richard La Rosa, attorney for Farino, said, ``We'll
have to see. It's an expensive process.''
   Earlier Friday, jurors had told the trial judge they were
hopelessly deadlocked and unable to reach a verdict. But state
Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos responded to the jurors's
noontime note saying, ``We are not at an impasse. We are against a
mountain.''
   ``This is far too an important matter ... for you, after a trial
of this length, simply to throw in the sponge,'' Demakos admonished
them, noting that there had been five weeks of testimony.
   ``I ask that you reason with each other and listen to reason,''
he added.
   The Howard Beach incident, which New York civil rights activists
said was a symptom of racism, resulted in the death of 23-year-old
Michael Griffith, who was struck by a car as he fled the gang of
whites.
   Three young men were convicted of manslaughter in an earlier
trial, and a fourth was acquitted. Two other teen-agers pleaded
guilty to riot charges just prior to the second trial.
   Griffith's mother, Jean Griffith, said Thursday's verdict ``is
not justice.''
   ``Nobody knows the pain of what we're going through. For me, I
have nothing ... I lost everything. My son is dead,'' said Mrs.
Griffith, who was in court Friday.
   John Saggese, the defendant's father, said he shed ``tears of
joy for my son's acquittal, tears of sorrow for the boys who were
convicted and for Mrs. Griffith and her loss.''
   The elder Saggese reiterated the defendants' contention that
Howard Beach is not a racist community, adding, ``We're loving
people and I wish people could see it that way.''
   Gucciardo had been charged with beating Cedric Sandiford with a
tree limb during the attack. Sandiford, 37, testified during the
trial that he was beaten by the white gang until he feigned
unconsciousness.

   Despite rumbles of discontent from Jesse Jackson,
Michael Dukakis is confidently predicting Jackson will campaign
actively for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket in the fall campaign.
   ``I want him involved, I want his staff people involved,''
Dukakis said Friday in a wide-ranging interview in the governor's
office at the Massachusetts Statehouse.
   Jackson had shown disappointment over Dukakis' choice of Texas
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen for the vice presidential nomination, but on
Friday he called the idea of a convention challenge to the choice a
``moot question.''
   Ron Brown, Jackson's convention manager, said the campaign ``has
no present plans to put Jesse Jackson's name up for vice
president.''
   Sitting in shirt sleeves in his office, Dukakis sounded upbeat
as he looked ahead to his trip to Atlanta for the Democratic
convention that will culminate a marathon campaign Wednesday by
naming him the party's presidential nominee.

   The Soviet Union and China criticized the
United States for downing an Iranian airliner over the Persian
Gulf, but the Security Council is likely to consider a compromise
that distributes the blame.
   Iran failed to get Security Council members to condemn the
United States Friday for the July 3 attack that left 290 people
dead, and most nations said the urgent priority is to end the
8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.
   The Soviet Union said the U.S. Navy must withdraw from the gulf
in favor of a U.N. peacekeeping force.
   ``This tragedy has demonstrated once again that the U.S. naval
fleet must leave the gulf without delay,''said Valentine V.
Lozinskiy, the deputy Soviet representative.
   Iran had asked for the Security Council meeting on the shooting
down of the Airbus A300 by the U.S. Navy cruiser Vincennes. The
15-nation Security Council adjourned the matter until Monday after

   Los Angeles drug gangs are spreading
cocaine and violence in cities nationwide and may become a new form
of organized crime unless they are stopped soon, the Los Angeles
County district attorney warns.
   ``This isn't organized crime as we understand that today. But I
think it's the genesis of a new form of organized crime involved in
drug trafficking,'' District Attorney Ira Reiner said Friday.
   ``If we don't stamp it out throughout the country now, while it
is still manageable, we can come back 10 years from now and talk
about the full-blown problem of organized crime, because that is
what it will be,'' he said.

   Nicaraguan rebels,
shaken by U.S. aid reductions and dissidents demanding more
democracy within the Contra movement, are seeking to reorganize the
Nicaraguan Resistance.
   Leaders of the Contras from Miami, Venezuela, Costa Rica and
other points will meet in the Concorde Hotel on Sunday and Monday
to resolve issues that threaten to split the rebels fighting the
leftist Sandinista government.
   Nicaraguan Ambassador Danilo Valle said his government was
disturbed that the Dominican government would allow ``groups and

   A woman who secretly gave birth in an

   The husband, Louis Locasto, saw his 3-day-old daughter for the
first time on Friday and said he would fight to gain custody of
her. Social workers filed court documents seeking to keep the baby
for another 10 days.
   ``We'll make allegations regarding the behavior of the mother

   From forks to frying pans, the diversity of

Christie mystery books.
   The weapon of choice in Chicago for doing in a neighbor,
relative or worst enemy remains the firearm, says the 1987 Murder
Analysis Report, a compendium of statistics about murder in the
Windy City compiled by the police department.
   But last year, people in Chicago were killed with an almost
A-to-Z arsenal of weapons, from an ashtray in one case to wooden
boards in five slayings, the report shows.
   One person was murdered with an axe, another was killed with an
electric fan and a third was apparently burned to death with hot
grease, says the report, which lists the type of weapon and the
number of cases in which it was used without elaborating on the
circumstances.

<HEAD>A Survivor of Hollywood's Unfriendly 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BARCELONA, SPAIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Filmmaker Edward Dmytryk makes this grim
prediction: ``When I die, I know the obits will read `one of
Hollywood's Unfriendly 10,' not `director of `The Caine Mutiny,'
`The Young Lions,' `Raintree County' and other films.'''
   Still vital at 79 and a teacher of film at the University of
Southern California, Dmytryk was in Spain for a symposium on the
Hollywood Blacklist at the Barcelona Film Festival. He made the
trip from Los Angeles knowing that his appearance at the July 4
panel could cause fireworks. And it did.
   The festival also invited directors Jules Dassin (``Rififi,''
``Never on Sunday'') and John Berry (``Claudine,'' ``Thieves''),
and writer Walter Bernstein (``Little Miss Marker,'' ``The
Front''). All three were refused employment in the Hollywood
studios during the 1950s because of alleged Communist Party
membership.
   Dmytryk and writer Ring Lardner Jr. (``M-A-S-H'') are the two
surviving members of the Unfriendly 10 who declined to testify
about communist membership before a congressional committee and
served prison terms for contempt of Congress. Dmytryk emerged from
six months imprisonment and testified about his party membership,
naming names of fellow members.
   Those events happened 40 years ago, but the antipathies remain.
Dassin, Berry and Bernstein refused to appear on the platform with
Dmytryk. He sat in the audience with his wife, the former actress,
Jean Porter, and heard himself excoriated as ``informer,''
``Judas'' and ``scum'' by his three former comrades.
   ``I didn't give any names that weren't already known by the
FBI,'' Dmytryk responded. He told of entering the Communist Party
``with dreams and ideals; when you finally found out that those
dreams and ideals were all garbage, you hated like hell to lose
them.''
   After 90 minutes of heated exchanges, Dassin announced, ``I do
not wish to be engaged in a symposium with Mr. Dmytryk.'' He left
the room, accompanied by Berry and Bernstein. The audience was
stunned. Mrs. Dmytryk bowed her head and wept.
   In his hotel room, Edward Dmytryk glanced back at those
turbulent days when Hollywood _ and the nation _ was caught up in
the Red hunting fever. He said he had joined the party in 1945
because he thought it was active in some good causes. At that time
he was one of RKO's hottest directors, having made ``Murder, My
Sweet,'' which started a whole genre of private-eye movies.
   The only point of agreement among all four panelists was that no
communist propaganda ever reached the screen; the studio bosses
were too alert to allow that. But some of the hard-core party
members tried.
   ``My disillusionment with the party started after I had finished
and edited `Cornered,''' he recalled. ``Both Adrian Scott (producer
and one of the Unfriendly 10) and I had taken out all of the
communist propaganda that the scriptwriter had put in. The script
was full of manifestos and was impossible to make.
   ``Adrian and I were called on the carpet (by party leaders) and
told to put the propaganda back in. But the picture was already
finished. And if I had shot the original script, the studio would
have put it on the shelf or thrown it out completely.''
   Dmytryk said he remained in the party ``only a few months.'' But
in 1948 he was among the 10 witnesses before the House Committe on
Un-American Activities who cited the First Amendment in refusing to
testify.
   ``That was a mistake; later witnesses cited the Fifth Amendment
and were not tried,'' he said.
   If he had left the party, why didn't he testify?
   ``I didn't want to do it before jail, because they would call me
a coward. They'd say I was doing it simply to stay out of jail,''
he said.
   ``I made my first announcement that I had been a member just
before I got out of jail. That didn't satisfy the other side.''
   In 1951, Dmytryk appeared before the committee to tell of his
disillusionment with the party, and he identified 26 people as
communists.
   ``I didn't feel guilty about talking,'' he said. ``I knew what
would happen: that they would call me a rat. But I did what I
wanted to do. I have never regretted it.''
   The director's recanting did not immediately revive his career.
His first assignment was a quickie for which he was paid $500. Then
Stanley Kramer assigned him to a series of modest-budget films,
followed by `The Caine Mutiny.'' He became one of Hollywood's
busiest directors, making ``Broken Lance'' (Spencer Tracy),
``Soldier of Fortune'' (Clark Gable), ``Raintree County''
(Elizabeth Taylor, Montgomery Clift), ``The Young Lions'' (Clift,
Marlon Brando) and ``The Carpetbaggers'' (George Peppard, Alan
Ladd).
   Dmytryk turned from directing to teaching 10 years ago and has
written textbooks on filmmaking.

<HEAD>Documentary Features Untold Stories From 1984 Summer Olympics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK WARNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Sports Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While television cameras focused on the leaders,
filmmaker Bud Greenspan zeroed in on the last-place runner in the
5,000-meter final at the 1984 Summer Olympics.
   Dave Moorcroft was the world record-holder at the distance, but
injuries had destroyed his chances of winning in Los Angeles.
   As Moorcroft fell farther and farther behind, Greenspan told his
cameramen to focus on the British runner.
   ``They said, `Are you sure? He's last,''' Greenspan recalled.
``And I said, `I know, just do it.' They thought I was crazy.''
   Like a fox.
   Moorcroft's battle to avoid being lapped by the winner, Said
Aouita, is one of the memorable moments in ``16 Days of Glory,''
Greenspan's six-hour documentary on the 1984 Games. It will be
broadcast in one-hour segments on public television beginning
Wednesday night.
   The film features such well-known athletes as gymnast Mary Lou
Retton, track star Carl Lewis and diver Greg Louganis. What makes
it special, however, are the athletes and stories that were ignored
or slighted in ABC's vast coverage of the 1984 Games.
   ``I'm not just interested in winners,'' Greenspan said. ``Often,
the losers make a better story.''
   Greenspan, 61, has chronicled both in his career.
   Since forming his film company in 1967, the former sportscaster
has written, produced and directed documentaries and television
specials on subjects ranging from the Heisman Trophy to the early
days of baseball. He has also written several books and recorded 19
spoken-word albums.
   But his main passion is making movies about the Olympics.
   Greenspan and his late wife, Cappy, won Emmy awards for ``The
Olympiad'' television series. ``Wilma,'' his 1977 TV movie on the
life of Olympic champion Wilma Rudolph, got rave reviews and high
ratings. And he's just completed his latest Olympic project, the
official film of the 1988 Winter Olympics.
   Greenspan's love affair with the Olympics began with the 1948
Games in London.
   One of the competitors that year was Karoly Takacs of Hungaria,
a former pistol shooting champion whose right hand _ the one he
shot with _ was shattered by a grenade in 1938.
   ``He was so despondent he contemplated suicide,'' Greenspan
said. ``But in 1948, there he was, in London, and he won the gold
medal in pistol shooting. He had learned to shoot with his left
hand.''
   That's the kind of human-interest story that excites Greenspan
and gives his Olympic shows a distinct flavor.
   ``16 Days of Glory'' includes segments on Japanese judo champion
Yasuhiro Yamashita, who overcame a painful leg injury to win a gold
medal; U.S. runner Henry Marsh, who competed in the steeplechase
with a serious viral infection, and American swimmer John Moffet,
who hurt his leg while qualifying for the 100-meter freestyle.
   ``I'm interested in people, not statistics,'' Greenspan said.
``I don't care about 10.2 dashes and .365 batting averages. I'm a
storyteller. I want to make a connection between the athlete and
the audience.''
   ``16 Days of Glory'' reflects Greenspan's idealistic view of the
Olympics. The Soviet bloc boycott is mentioned only briefly, as is
the controversial Mary Decker-Zola Budd collision. In the women's
3,000-meter race, Decker fell after tripping over Budd's trailing
leg as the South African runner moved in front of the American.
Greenspan prefers to shine his spotlight on Maricica Puica, the
Romanian runner whose victory was overshadowed by Decker's fall.
   ``I'm not naive. I know about the politics and the
controversy,'' Greenspan said. ``But I would rather concentrate on
the athletes and the competition. That's what I do best.''
   It took years of research, a first-rate crew and a million feet
of film to make the 1984 Olympics film.
   ``Logistically, it's like putting together the Normandy
invasion,'' Greenspan said. ``You do as much pre-production as
possible, but a lot of it is never used. We threw out about 80
percent of the stuff we filmed before the Games.''
   While Greenspan awaits the TV premiere of ``16 Days of Glory,''
he is busy working on two other Olympic programs _ a docudrama on
the 1936 Berlin Games and a television special that follows
teen-age athletes as they trained for the 1988 Games in South Korea.
   Despite tight security in Seoul, some people are afraid the
Games could be marred by terrorism or student riots. Greenspan, who
just returned from the South Korean capital, said the fears are
unfounded.
   ``It's safer than Central Park,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   More than seven months of Palestinian riots and
strikes have turned Israelis hawkish, but the hardline often masks
ambivalence about the future of the occupied lands and the army's
use of force.
   Israeli defensiveness stems from a belief that the occupied
territories, especially the Jordan River's West Bank, are uniquely
bound to the state of Israel.
   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the armed forces chief of staff, said the
West Bank and Gaza Strip were not distant battlefields like Algeria
was for the French or Vietnam for the Americans.
   ``There is no debate among the soldiers. They know that, by and
large, this problem is inside our own house, and there is no one
who can take charge of the situation and solve it but the army,''
Shomron told the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem.
   Some critics, however, fear Israelis are becoming callous about
the violence in which more than 200 Palestinians have been killed,
at least 1,500 wounded and 5,000 jailed since Dec. 8.
   ``Society has been brutalized,'' said Dedi Zucker, parliament
member from the liberal Citizens Rights Movement. ``We can see it
in the army, in the police, even in the way our children talk. I
think we all have become accustomed to a higher level of violence.''
   On the other hand, Avner Shaki, a hawk recently elected head of
the National Religious Party, defends the Israeli army.
   ``Are we angels? Is there any nation that would have been, per
capita, more noble or moral than we have been, taking into
consideration all the terrorism that surrounds us?''
   Zucker, who has emerged as an outspoken critic of the
government's ``iron fist'' approach to suppressing riots, said
initial Israeli public reaction was low-key because many remained
unaffected.
   ``People in Tel Aviv just heard about the troubles on TV at
night,'' he said in an interview. ``The bulk of society succeeded
in ignoring developments in the West Bank. The reason is they did
not pay a price.''
   But they may be starting to pay a price and all parties agree
the Palestinian uprising has become the No. 1 issue in the campaign
for national elections Nov. 1:
   _Four Israelis (as opposed to more than 200 Palestinians) had
been killed by the end of June, and the an estimated 425 soldiers
and Israeli civilians have been injured, most lightly by stones
thrown by protesters.
   _Minister of Economy Gad Yacoubi estimates Israel's losses from
the uprising at mid-May totalled $500 million, most in lost tourist
business and increased security costs.
   _The government increased the annual military reserve duty from
40 to 62 days annually, a decision felt in nearly every Jewish
household.
   While life 60 miles from the West Bank in Tel Aviv is largely
untouched, many more civilians walk the streets of Jerusalem with
automatic pistols clipped on their belts.
   Moshe Weiss, the Interior Ministry official in charge of gun
licensing, said 200,000 Israelis were authorized to carry firearms
last year and the number grew by as much as 20 percent since the
Palestinian riots, with many more denied permits.
   ``There is a drift to the right,'' said Hannoch Smith, a leading
Israeli pollster.
   He added in an interivew that polls of 1,200 Israelis in
December and March indicated the number who supported Israel's
harsh measures jumped from 51 percent to 74 percent.
   Shaki, whose National Religious Party is an ally of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, said at his Tel Aviv home
riots had strengthened Israeli resolve to keep the occupied land.
   ``We are going to be firmer in our decision to keep in our hands
as much as we can of Judea and Samaria,'' he said, using the
biblical names for the West Bank.
   But polls also indicate some trends in public opinion favorable
to the liberal Labor Party of Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   Smith said Israelis' support for Labor's idea of giving up land
for peace was the highest in a decade with 48 percent in favor, 41
percent against and 11 percent undecided. This was a 7 percent jump
to the favorable side in six months, he said.
   Polls by Smith and the rival Dahaf organization also found a
majority of the public ready to talk with the Palestine Liberation
Organization if it recognized Israel and renounced violence.
   ``The public is saying: put down the unrest by all means
necessary and then think about negotiating,'' said Smith.
   Many Israelis acknowledge, however, they have ambivalent
feelings about the riots and strikes. Even liberal advocates of
territorial compromise tend to change their views when they put on
a military uniform or have family and friends attacked by
stone-throwing mobs.
   Rafael Moses, a psychiatrist, linked the defensive reaction to
the Holocaust, the slaughter of 6 million Jews by the Nazis in
World War II.
   ``The sensitivity of the Israelis to being attacked, provoked
and criticized connects to the Holocaust at times,'' he said.
   He added, however, that such sensitivity did not guarantee Jews
would sympathize with the plight of the Palestinians.
   Amia Leblich, dean of social sciences at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, said the unrest has polarized Arabs and Jews.
   ``I think the Arab students here, for example, are more
withdrawn, more segregated,'' she said, noting groups representing
the 1,200 Arabs in the 18,000-member student body refused offers of
public dialogue or joint academic projects.
   Shlomo Gazit, former head of military intelligence, said
Israelis may seek to lessen dependency on Palestinians, importing
foreign labor to replace striking laborers.
   ``Psychologically, there is a very strong realization that is
new in Israel that coexistence with an Arab population literally is
not possible under the present circumtances,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BANI NAIM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The uprisings in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip have spawned a new generation of Palestinian
leaders and given their people confidence to challenge Israeli army
rule.
   The change is evident here in Bani Naim, a farming town 17 miles
south of Jerusalem, where the streets are blackened from tires
burned in protest of Israeli occupation.
   Hassan Manasara, 27, a leader of the town's resistance, said a
new community spirit has taken shape and that a senior Israeli
officer encountered it when he came to Bani Naim to urge calm.
   Manasara said the residents confounded the Israeli by refusing
to answer simple questions about their place of work.
   ``When the officer asked how many people are farmers, everyone
raised his hand,'' Manasara said. ``And when he asked how many work
as laborers in Israel, everyone raised his hand.
   ``The Israeli threatened to cut off the water, and everyone
laughed.''
   Even so, Bani Naim has paid a heavy price. Residents say three
townspeople have been killed, 35 wounded and 150 arrested since
December. The town of 10,000 also spent 20 days under an
around-the-clock curfew.
   Residents agreed to on austerity measures, such as banning large
wedding and graduation parties, to conserve resources to support
the families of those without work or in jail.
   The town is now run by ``popular committees.'' A security
committee patrols at night to watch for Israeli patrols, a
first-aid committee treats the injured, a finance committee handles
welfare.
   Sari Nusseibah, a leading Palestinian intellectural, said
committees such as those in Bani Naim were the most hopeful sign of
the uprising because they could be the foundation for a Palestinian
state.
   But he added the new leadership was untested and suggested that
if the committees ``faded away,'' it might be more difficult to
rally Palestinians in the future.
   He also said he was disappointed that Palestinians had not
developed a political strategy during the uprising.
   ``I felt from the beginning that it is not enough to wage war,
but you have to wage peace equally strongly,'' he said. ``To do one
without the other is to waste effort.''
   Some Israeli leaders contend the grass-roots leaders in towns
and villages only carry out the orders of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization, but Bani Naim's local leaders dispute this.
   ``What's decided here is not from the outside. There are no
orders from outside,'' said Manasara.
   Much will depend on whether Palestinians continue to support
strikes and civil disobedience, such as refusing to pay taxes or
accepting Israeli identity cards.
   Saif-Edin Natsheh, 34, owner of a stone-cutting factory in the
West Bank town of Hebron, noted leaflets urged the development of
Arab business to lessen dependence on Israel. But he complained the
Palestinian self-reliance campaign was undermined by strikes and
tax boycotts.
   ``This month we only worked five days because of too many strike
calls,'' he said. ``How am I going to pay the seven workers and
feed my seven children with five days of work?''
   Natsheh also said he was caught in the middle by the tax
boycott, threatened with jail by the Israelis if he failed to pay
and fearful his factory would be burned down by Palestinians if he
did.
   ``I pay in secret,'' he added.
   Before the violence erupted in December, a web of economic and
personal relations linked the 1.5 million Palestinians to Israel.
   Some 110,000 Arabs shuttled daily to jobs in Israel and brought
home $500 million to $700 million a year. The West Bank and Gaza
Strip also became Israel's second-largest market, accounting for
$780 million, or 11 percent, of exports in 1987.
   Nusseibah, a professor of philosphy at Bir Zeit University in
the West Bank, said the biggest achievement of the uprising was
re-creating, at least psychologically, the border that divided
Israel from the West Bank and Gaza before the 2,200 square miles of
land was seized in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   ``A process of integration had been under way for the past 21
years,'' he said. ``It was challenged in the uprising, and for the
first time people began to practice what they preach.''
   Bonds of practical coexistence have been torn by the bloodshed
and mass arrests, which touched most villages and neighborhoods.
   During the unrest, more than 200 Palestinians were killed.
According to left-wing Israeli lawmaker Dedi Zucker, Arab injuries
totalled 5,132 by June and arrests had reached 17,000.
   The hatred that fuels the unrest is also born of humiliation,
which is intensely felt by those who have been arrested.
   Abdel Aziz Randisi, a pediatrician jailed for six months without
trial in the Ketziot prison camp in Israel's Negev Desert,
complained to a reporter during a prison tour about being made to
kneel down for roll calls and infractions of camp rules.
   ``I would rather die than do this kneeling,'' he said.
   Qassem Ali, a journalist from Gaza who was also in the prison,
predicted such treatment of influential community leaders would
boomerang on Israel.
   ``I think the conditions here have made the people more radical
and created more hatred, and this will be a problem,'' he said.
   In the West Bank town of Yatta, a 21-year-old student at
Bethlehem University who said he could not give his name because he
was wanted by authorities, spoke in a similar but more impassioned
vein.
   ``Before the uprising, people didn't have the will to
demonstrate or throw a rock at a soldier,'' he said. ``Before the
uprising people who worked in Israel were treated as slaves.
   ``Now, we are human beings.''

   Each day, Kurt Chase surveys his family's
parched fields, wondering if that day's intense heat and dry winds
will spell the difference between survival and disaster for the
withering crops.
   ``Sometimes it looks so bad, I don't know if they can stand one
more day of it,'' says Chase, who spends about 60 hours a week
working in the fields with his father, Gordon.
   For the Chase family, the biggest fear is the fear of the
unknown.
   ``There are so many `What ifs,' to ask,'' says Jean Chase,
Gordon's wife, Kurt's mother. ``What if it doesn't rain? What if we
can't pay the bills?''
   Thousands of farmers across the nation's midsection are asking
themselves the same questions. The worst dry spell since the Dust
Bowl of the 1930s presents few certainties.
   The wind gusting across the Chases' dairy and cash-crop farm
sometimes blows away the sandy soil to expose seeds that should
have germinated weeks ago.
   Most years, the Chases produce so much feed there's enough left
over to sell after their 300 head of beef and dairy cattle are fed.
   Not this year. The first cutting of hay was weak and the second
almost non-existent.
   ``With the price of soybean meal going up the way it has been,
we're not going to be able to buy any to feed the cows for
protein,'' Gordon Chase says softly, nervously rubbing his
forehead. ``The impact of what we might be in for really didn't hit
me until just recently.''
   As they sit in their living room, in matching blue recliners,
the blond-haired couple look younger than their 51 years.
   Outside, in the arid air, an American flag hangs limply from a
pole. Inside, in the non-air-conditioned house, big fans, turned up
full blast, ease the 90-degree-plus heat.
   Gordon and Jean met in high school. They married 32 years ago.
Now they sit surrounded by framed photographs of three children and
six grandchildren, by a rambling, white, two-story farmhouse, and
by their 1,100 acres _ 400 their own, 700 rented _ in the rolling
countryside of southwest Michigan's Barry County.
   Mrs. Chase does the bookkeeping and helps work the fields. But
morale-boosting is her main job, she says. ``If you don't keep
yourself up, nothing else matters.''
   Last year was one of the family's most profitable, as it was for
many farmers, and at the start of this season their projected
income was the highest it had ever been.
   But the cloudless skies have turned much of their hay, wheat and
soybean fields into barren lots of dust.
   They have given up on most of their 350 acres of corn, deciding
to use their limited irrigation to keep 60 acres alive. The rest
will be used to feed their cattle.
   Since April 1, Barry County has received less than six inches of
rain _ barely half the normal rainfall. It has gotten drier as time
goes on. The forecasters say the steady rain needed to reverse the
impending disaster is unlikely through at least July. By then it
may be too late.
   ``We're at a critical point,'' Gordon Chase says, sinking back
into his chair. ``I don't know what we're going to do if it doesn't
rain. I guess just hope that your lenders will be a little
lenient.''
   For the Chases, this is the most trying period since they fell
victim to the sky-high interest rates of the late 1970s and early
'80s and almost lost more than half their farm.
   Six years ago they hired a financial consultant and
``restructured.'' About four years ago, Kurt, 28, and his wife,
Dena, 27, entered into partnership with the Chases. The family has
since seem some good seasons.
   But this year they are more than ever preoccupied with weather
reports and crop prices. They watch the ups and downs of Chicago
Board of Trade prices on a computer screen in their home office.
   ``We might be better off than most, but we are very, very
financially stressed,'' Mrs. Chase says. They may end up struggling
to cover feed, seed and other operating expenses that could
approach $100,000 this year.
   No amount of planning can immunize them from a drought. They
recently applied for $7,300 worth of drought insurance for 500
acres, but have been told that they will probably be turned down
because of excessive demand.
   The Chases often attend professional farm-management seminars.
   ``We have high school educations, but we learn to tap into every
resource we can,'' she says. ``I think that's what's gotten us
through some very hard times.''
   Gordon and Kurt are working overtime to produce extra milk from
their 125 milking cows, to make up for projected crop shortfalls.
   ``Farmers have got to be one of the most optimistic kinds of
people _ things are always going to be better next year,'' says
Gordon Chase. ``We're fighters and will fight as long as we can _
up to the point of reality. ...
   ``It really gets to us when we hear people talking about how
brown their lawns are getting. This is our life here.''
   Mrs. Chase thinks of the drought as a test _ not only of the
family's farming abilities but also of their faith. Their church
services include special prayers for rain.
   ``Maybe this is making us all aware of our priorities,'' she
says. ``We take so much for granted.''

   The drought searing the midlands is the second
crisis of the decade for many American farmers. This report, part
of a periodic series on the impact of the drought on one family,
the Chases of Barry County, Michigan, looks at the economics of
surviving one trial and preparing for another.

   It's not an easy story for Jean and
Gordon Chase to tell. A story of perceived failure never is.
   For the Chases and for countless farmers like them across the
country, the stories of lost land and lost dreams are memories that
should be put to rest. But each passing day of drought _ of intense
heat, high winds, no rain _ brings those painful memories closer to
the surface.
   ``We always felt we were successful. That's why it was so hard
on us and so hard even now to talk about it,'' Mrs. Chase says of
the crisis three years ago in which they nearly lost most of their
dairy and cash-crop farm here in southwest Michigan.
   The crisis was 10 years in the making, beginning when the Chases
tried to borrow money in 1975 to buy a 237-acre farm to add to the
160 acres they bought from Mrs. Chases' parents 10 years earlier.
   Because her parents had farmed only part time, the Chases
consider themselves first-generation farmers. ``When we started, we
didn't have $25 in our pockets,'' Mrs. Chase says. ``Gord just had
the desire.''
   ``Gord'' and Jean, bringing up three children, had a successful
few years in the business and found it easy to borrow money in the
inflationary 1970s.
   ``Everything was put at such an inflated value, all your
equipment and land, that the banks couldn't give you enough to
borrow because of all your collateral,'' says Chase, relighting his
pipe and recalling the mistake that almost cost the former truck
driver his dream of being a farmer.
   But then inflation eased, crop prices fell and banks quit
lending in 1982. The Chases, like so many farmers, were still
saddled with high-interest debt, but their income was declining.
Many farmers faced bankruptcy. Many kept trying to borrow just to
survive.
   ``It just kept snowballing, and suddenly, we were trapped,''
Mrs. Chase says. In 10 years they spent about $300,000 in interest
on about $20,000 in principal on that one farm.
   ``There's a saying,'' Chase says. ``If you can't keep up, you
can't catch up.''
   When the Chases tried to find private investors in 1982 to help
them out of their hole, they wound up finding a financial
consultant instead. ``He told us `You don't need more money, you
need to manage it better,''' Mrs. Chase says.
   Acting on his advice, the cost of which rose from $250 to $500
per monthly session, the Chases sold 40 percent of their dairy
herd, keeping the healthiest and most profitable. He also urged
them to enter a partnership with their son and daughter-in-law,
trading some of their high-interest debt for lower interest rates
offered the young couple.
   But the land was still worth less than the debt they carried on
it. In 1985, unable to meet the repayment schedule, the Chases were
advised by their consultant to give up the farm, deeding it to Farm
Land Bank.
   Then, under the new arrangement, they leased it back _ parcel by
parcel _ with an option to repurchase. They never stopped farming.
They came up with the monthly rent, were finally able to borrow at
lower interest rates, and then bought it back.
   ``It was probably the worst year of our lives. Many tears were
shed,'' Mrs. Chase says. ``But if we hadn't done it, we probably
wouldn't be farming today.''
   The worst part of their agonizing decision to give up the farm
was that their friends and neighbors could see their ``failure.''
Though hoping to keep the transaction private, the Chases found
their land on the growing list of farms for sale published by
Federal Land Bank, now Farm Credit Services.
   ``This is a community where everybody knows everybody, and all
of a sudden it became coffee shop news that our farm was for
sale,'' Mrs. Chase says with tear-filled eyes, recalling the
family's sense of humiliation.
   As soon as the news got out, ``we felt surrounded by vultures,''
Chase says. ``Seven or eight neighbors would have done anything to
get that land.''
   They say one neighbor on the Farmers Home Administration's local
board urged the other two members to deny the Chases' application
for a low-interest loan. But the Chases won an appeal at the state
level.
   ``There's a sense of pride when you own land that I can't
compare to anything else,'' Mrs. Chase says. ``To see that farm in
the newspaper hurt more than I can explain.''
   The Chases completed their repurchase of the farm last January.
Before the drought hit, they expected this to be their best year,
and they hoped to be debt-free in five years. But now
``everything's looking different,'' says Chase.
   The Chases just hope to cover their $50,000 annual expenses for
seed, fertilizer, chemicals and fuel for irrigation. The feed they
must buy for their 300 head of cattle usually costs $35,000 for the
year, but the price of the soybean meal continues to climb. With
careful planning, the Chases hope to have enough feed to get them
through the fall.
   They pre-sold 30 percent of their soybean crop at $7 a bushel at
the start of the season. But what was then considered 30 percent
may now make up their total soybean harvest. And now soybeans are
going for $10 a bushel. Only 60 acres of their 350-acre cornfield
looks salvageable.
   The Chases feel fortunate their dairy operation accounts for 60
percent of their income. But they worry that the federal government
might go through with a cut in milk price supports next January, as
planned.
   Working 60-hour weeks in the fields, taking on the heavy job of
moving their irrigation system to spots where it can do the most
good, the Chases sometimes wonder why they bother.
   Gordon Chase, a fan of motivational tapes, says he's trying to
take the experts' advice, view the drought as a temporary setback,
and keep going.
   ``It's easy to say it,'' he says, ``but close up this is the
real thing.''

<HEAD>Is This the Same Old Expansion?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The subject comes up again and again, most
recently from an examination of the latest and surprising
employment statistics issued earlier this month.
   The issue is this: Is the current economic expansion really 67
months old, a lifespan that puts it into the great-grandparent age
group? Or is it a lot younger than that, perhaps only a couple of
years or so?
   To put it another way, are we watching a continued,
uninterrupted expansion over the past 67 months, or was there a
break in the record that, perhaps for methodological reasons,
wasn't officially recorded?
   In short, is it conceivable that we are watching a young
expansion with room to grow rather than an old and tottering
expansion getting ready for the sickbed? Are we watching the
grandparent, or its offspring?
   A recession, which is a break in an expansion, is said to occur
when the gross national product declines for at least two straight
quarters. There is nothing official about that definition; it is
simply the one most used.
   By that definition, the current expansion began late in 1982 and
has continued since then. But not everyone is willing to accept the
definition. Times have changed; maybe the definition should, too.
   Could it be that the country actually went through a recession
that just wasn't record as such? According to some people who spend
a lot of time examining such things, it isn't just possible but
probable.
   To illustrate: In late 1986 the economy was said to be in an
expansion mode. For the nation as a whole, the gross national
product was rising _ and according to the popular concept, that
meant there was no recession.
   Examining the breakdown of the national figures, however, seemed
to present a reasonable challenge to the accepted definitions. The
breakdown showed many industries and many states doing very poorly,
and a few doing very well.
   The economic numbers from states doing well, mainly on the East
and West coasts, tended to hide the negative numbers produced in
the nation's midsection by manufacturing, mining, farming and
oil-related businesses.
   Sindlinger & Co., an economic research firm that conducts
lengthy personal finance surveys on a regular basis, relegated the
economies of no less than 31 states to what it says were recession
levels.
   Things turned around after that, however, and early this year
Sindlinger's measurements put only four states at recession levels:
Oklahoma, Louisiana, West Virginia and Mississippi. Meanwhile, the
New York economy had declined.
   The employment and jobless figures suggest something roughly
similar _ an initial economic advance, a slowdown, and then a
renewed period of strength.
   Reporting to Congress last week, Janet Norwood, commissioner of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, called attention to the phenomenon.
   ``We have really had three distinctly different stages of
(employment) growth,'' she said.
   ``First, a strong initial rebound occurred in the first two
years following the 1981-1982 recession. Then we had a two-year
period of slower, more moderate expansion, and, finally, the last
year and a half has been a period of strong growth.''
   In the past 18 months, she stated, factory and construction jobs
rose considerably, and the service-producing sector continued to
advance. All major worker groups had lower jobless rates, with the
sharpest drop among adult men.
   Other respected analysts also have observed the inconsistency of
the expansion. Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities even
suggests that deep recessions have been replaced by ``rolling
readjustments.''
   The term is not an empty euphemism, but refers to the tendency
noted by many others for one section of the nation to pick up the
economic slack of another and for certain categories of industries
to strengthen while others weaken.
   The national statistics might not show a recession or expansion
has occurred. But the residents of those areas and the workers in
those industries do not rely on the statistics. They know.
   Some of them will tell you that no matter what the learned folks
say about a 67-month expansion, they have been through a recession.
And for many of them, the economic expansion is brand new and
probably headed for a long life.

<HEAD>Kennedy's ``Quinn's Book'' Is Another Ode to Albany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William Kennedy toiled over three novels during
two decades of literary obscurity before No. 4, the
13-times-rejected ``Ironweed,'' brought him a Pulitzer Prize and
celebrity.
   So perhaps he has earned the right to ham it up a bit in
``Quinn's Book,'' his latest novel.
   Set in the mid-19th century, ``Quinn's Book'' (Viking, $18.95)
is the fourth in Kennedy's Albany cycle of novels, although Daniel
Quinn, the protagonist, travels far afield of the city the author
long ago staked out as his turf.
   The book is a pastiche of writing styles from the period,
blending journalistic reportage, Dickensian melodrama and Celtic
folk tales.
   Quinn, whom we first meet as a boatman's apprentice whose
parents died of cholera, begins his peripatetic adventures when he
rescues a beautiful girl from drowning in the icy Hudson while
Albany falls around him in a cataclysm of flood and fire. By book's
end he is a celebrated journalist who earned his reputation
covering the Civil War. Along the way he witnesses the opening of
the Saratoga Racetrack, the draft riots in New York, the workings
of the Underground Railroad and other wonders more fantasy than
fact.
   In a recent interview, Kennedy explained how his Albany cycle
evolved.
   ``It's a conception that goes back to the '60s. That's when I
began to think about writing a book like `Quinn,' only much larger
than `Quinn,' that would take the whole history of the city, from
the time of the Patroons (those who held large estates under grants
from Dutch government in New York) up to contemporary times,'' he
said.
   ``It was excessively ambitious, so I started chopping the
history into pieces. Eventually it evolved ... that I was going to
do these connected novels. I didn't know how many novels, so I
didn't want to say `trilogy' or `quintet' or anything like that. So
I just called it a `cycle.' And this is another in the cycle.''
   He was asked if Albany has become his Yoknapatawpha County, the
fictional Mississippi setting of so many of William Faulkner's
works.
   ``I would say so. It's a place where I can spread out and write
about anything in American history and make it relevant to that
particular part of the country, but also to the country at large,''
he said. ``Because Albany is in a very real sense a microcosm of
the whole country.''
   Kennedy professed to idolizing Faulkner.
   ``He's the one person I regret not having met. I think he's the
greatest American writer of the 20th century. His whole creation of
Yoknapatawpha was the reason I began to write this series of
connected novels. I found the way he interconnected his lives to be
quite extraordinary, and I thought it was a very compelling way to
write.''
   Fans of the other Albany novels, ``Legs,'' ``Billy Phelan's
Greatest Game'' and ``Ironweed,'' will enjoy ferreting out
characters in ``Quinn's Book'' mentioned as ancesters in those
works. Quinn, for example, is the grandfather of 10-year-old Daniel
Quinn in ``Ironweed.''
   Unlike ``Legs,'' Kennedy's fictional rendering of the real-life
gangster Legs Diamond, the author didn't let himself get bogged
down in historical research for ``Quinn's Book.''
   ``I worked quite differently on this book,'' he said. ``I knew
where I was going in a certain general sense. I knew I wanted to
deal with the Civil War, with journalism, with the theater, with
conspiratorial secret societies. And I knew some things about them,
so I went and did specific kinds of research _ the opening day at
Saratoga Racetrack, for example. I went to some pains to be
accurate.''
   During his research Kennedy stumbled across the name Will
Canaday, which he found too irresistible to pass up. So with tongue
firmly in cheek, the author, himself a former newspaperman,
bestowed the name on a secondary character, the editor of the
Albany Chronicle who takes young Quinn under his wing.
   The success of ``Ironweed'' has allowed Kennedy, 60, a longtime
film buff, to branch into writing screenplays. He wrote the
original screenplay for the Francis Coppola-directed ``The Cotton
Club'' as well as the screen adaptation of ``Ironweed.'' He has
also writen scripts for ``Legs'' and ``Billy Phelan,'' although
neither is currently under production.
   Kennedy is asked how writing for the cinema differs from writing
a novel.
   ``Very much different. With a novel you can do anything. With a
screenplay your scenes have to play in a page and a half. ...
Everything has to be created visually; you can't go inside a
character's mind the way you do in a novel. ... You can't have
people explaining things, talking forever like you can do in a
novel.''
   Meanwhile, Kennedy said he has just begun work on a novel that
is still too embryonic to discuss, except that it is set in 1958.
And in Albany. Of course.

<HEAD>Gas Crews Go Where Bedouins Fear to Tread _ Oman's Quicksands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEREDITH CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MUSCAT, Oman (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bedouin tribesmen won't go near the
quicksands in the desert of northern Oman. They say caravans of
camels and herds of goats have been swallowed up in what they call
the Umm as-Samim _ Mother of Poisons.
   But Western engineers are moving in just the same, defying the
desert nomads' superstition in hopes of tapping natural gas
believed to lie deep below the surface.
   ``We've heard the stories and we're obviously concerned,'' said
John Hayhurst, the British plant manager of Desert Line, the Omani
company that is preparing to build a road and set up drilling rigs
in the region.
   ``You have to approach a project like this with infinite care.
You have to investigate every inch of land before you move.''
   Bedouin tribes such as the nomadic Duru know how to endure the
sandstorms and blazing sun of the Rub al Khali (Empty Quarter), the
great sand-sea of Arabia with its 600-foot-high dunes.
   But they will not venture near the quicksands in the belief they
are haunted by devils.
   Bedouin tales speak of caravans of camels and their riders and
herds of goats disappearing in the quicksands of Oman, which is in
the southeastern corner of the Arabian peninsula.
   Most of Hayhurst's workers are foreigners, mainly from India and
Pakistan.
   Hayhurst said if workers wander off the compacted areas, they
could indeed sink without trace.
   ``We've very nearly lost equipment,'' he said. ``We're well
equipped with ropes and chains.''
   Hayhurst, 39, is a 17-year veteran of prospecting in the Middle
East and Africa, but this is his first experience with quicksands.
   Drillers will shortly move into the area, just south of the
Yibal oilfield discovered in 1962, targeted under the Omani
government's gas exploration program directed by the state-run
Petroleum Development Oman (PDO).
   Oil is the backbone of Oman's economy. Its production is about
600,000 barrels daily. Gas exploration is being intensified, mainly
for local consumption.
   PDO's project engineer, Dutchman Jan Martens, said: ``The
surface is a salty, silty material which is reasonably hard when
dry, but when wet is soft and would swallow a vehicle.
   ``The sandy layer is nine meters (27 feet) deep at the drilling
locations.''
   His engineers will ``float'' a road across the quicksands to
support a 1,500-ton drilling rig. The road will be built from
layers of webbed matting that will bind the soft sand together
beneath compacted surface material.
   The first European to observe these quicksands was the British
explorer Wilfred Thesiger, who described them in his book,
``Arabian Sands.''
   ``The ground of white gypsum powder was covered with a sand
sprinkled crust of salt, through which protruded occasional dead
twigs of salt bush,'' he wrote.
   ``These scattered bushes marked the firm land; farther out, only
a slight darkening of the surface indicated the bog below.''
   His Arab companion warned him not to go too near, telling
Thesiger a raiding party of Bedouin warriors had perished in the
sands and that he himself had watched a flock of goats disappear.
   The scientific explanation lies in the quicksands geographical
position as Oman's lowest inland area just 177 feet above sea-level.
   The area acts as a sump for rainwater running out from gulches
in the mountains of northern Oman.
   As the water runs down, it leaches salt from the earth and
carries it to into the Mother of Poisons, where the water
evaporates in the searing sun, crystallizing the salt in a thick
white crust on the surface.
   The crust crunches underfoot. But its firmness is deceptive and
the water table may be only a few inches underneath.
   The sands were the center of a flourishing salt trade many years
ago.
   Caravans of camels ventured in. Some never returned, the Bedouin
say, swallowed without trace.

<DATELINE>LEH, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Isolated and dreary all winter long, Leh
springs to life in summer when vegetables ripen in the fields and
tourists swarm in from 11,500 feet below, filling up 80 hotels and
guest houses in the world's highest desert.
   Women wearing shining strings of turquoise and coral greet the
visitors with shy smiles and a soft ``julley'' _ hello.
   With about 10,000 permanent residents, Leh is the major town of
India's Ladakh region, a Himalayan desert because high surrounding
mountains block rain and snow. But the area is cut off when snow at
lower altitudes block roads and the region's 68,000 people settle
in for eight months of winter privation.
   But this time of year people and supplies flow in and Leh, known
as the ``Last Shangri-La,'' vibrates.
   Stark, brown mountains surround the town and the Buddhist
monasteries perched on hilltops.
   The moonlike landscape is broken occasionally by splashes of
willow and poplar and small farms growing wheat, barley and
vegetables.
   Come June, the Leh valley fills with Europeans and Americans _
tourists and mountain trekkers.
   The road from Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, opens as the
snow melts down the mountains.
   ``Last year, even matchsticks were not available because the
road closed early and opened late,'' said Akbar Ladakhi, a
long-time resident.
   ``People survive on tsempa,'' he said.
   Tsempa, a salted paste of chickpea flour, is eaten sometimes
with onions and sometimes thinned into a soup. Wealthier Ladakhis
spice their winters with a barley wine.
   But with summer, these high-desert people feast on tomatoes,
turnips, carrots, peas, potatoes and beans, all either grown
locally or shipped from below when the road opens.
   Akbar Ladakhi said tourism has helped improve the region's
economy, providing money for reviving dying arts, restoring
monastries and preserving old Buddhist paintings.
   But some others feel tourists have commercialized Ladakh, where
merchants once slept amid their wares and buyers simply took goods
and left money behind.
   ``Corruption culture has invaded us. People have become clever
and business-minded,'' said Sonam Wangchuk, a student involved in
promoting Ladakhi culture and dance.
   He complained youngsters were becoming Westernized, discarding
their traditional robes for T-shirts and jeans. Leh's main street
is filled with the music of Hindi movies and and Michael Jackson.
   For the summer tourists, restaurants offer an array of Chinese
and Tibetan foods but cooks also have mastered apple and banana
pancakes for those preferring a Western-style breakfast.
   Ladakh is a predominantly Buddhist region influenced over the
centuries by nearby Tibet. The region was originally a Tibetan
province and is still known as ``Little Tibet.''
   But rock carvings found nearby indicate Ladakh had been used for
thousands of years by nomadic tribes, including the Mons of north
India, the Dards of Baltistan and the Mongols of central Asia.
   Ladakh's Golden Age began in 1533 when King Soyang Namgyal
united the region, established his capital at Leh, and extended his
boundaries to the outskirts of Lhasa in Tibet.
   Kashmiri rulers invaded in the last century and, since India's
independence from Britain in 1947, the region has been caught up in
India's border wars with Pakistan and China.
   The Namgyal Palace overlooking Leh stands as a mute testimony to
the battles, its sprawling walls bearing wide, gaping holes.
   Most Ladakhis are followers of the Dalai Lama, the exiled
god-king of Tibet who lives in the Indian Himalayan town of
Dharamsala.
   Tibetan prayer flags flutter over most houses and shops, their
colors fading under summer's bright sun.
   Being near the Indian-Chinese border, Ladakh also is an army
base. Convoys of army trucks spew black smoke along the narrow
roads. The army also is the region's biggest employer, hiring local
people to build military roads and dams.
   But most work ends in September when winter begins. People lay
in food and firewood; only emergency goods are brought in by army
planes.
   Temperatures go down to 18 degrees below zero Farhenheit and
prices soar.
   But Wangchuk, the traditionalist, says the people are enured to
it.
   ``We have grown up with hardship,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter
if you don't have vegetables or milk.''

<HEAD>Israeli Schools Put Palestinian Issue into Curriculum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palestinian uprising has prompted educators
to discuss current events and encourage debate about the
Arab-Israeli conflict in Israeli classrooms for the first time.
   New Education Ministry orders to devote classes to the
Palestinian issue breaks with a 40-year tradition begun by Israel's
first prime minister, the late David Ben-Gurion. He barred teachers
from raising topical political issues in school.
   As a result, the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has
normally not gone beyond the 1967 Middle East War, when Israel was
lopsidedly victorious, and usually ignored detailed references to
the Palestinian point of view.
   Now, however, students heatedly argue such issues as whether
Israel should negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization
or withdraw from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Teachers fear high school pupils who face a compulsory military
draft at 18 will be emotionally unprepared for army service unless
they are better educated about the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Another concern is to avoid the swelling of anti-Arab prejudice
which has grown among Israeli youth in the wake of the Palestinian
uprising that began Dec. 8 and has claimed the lives of more than
200 Arabs and four Israelis.
   ``I've started to think about the Palestinian side of things. .
.. Now I understand that a state is what they (the Palestinians)
need,'' Danny Sirkin, 17, said in a recent discussion in his 11th
grade classroom.
   Few students agreed with the Sirkin.
   ``If we return the territories, nobody knows if that will bring
war or peace. The PLO wants all of Israel,'' said Doron
Kapitolnick, 17.
   The 40-minute debate was at the Rene Cassin High School, built
on a battlefield of the 1967 war when Israel captured the Arab
sector of Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan and wrested the
Gaza Strip from Egyptian control.
   Most students said peace talks were needed but maintained Israel
should boycott the PLO, even though Palestinians consider that
group to be their only representative.
   Other students expressed concern for relatives serving in the
occupied territories.
   ``The outside world doesn't understand,'' said Tamar Kater.
``They only talk about soldiers beating Arabs. It's not their
fathers or brothers doing army reserve duty.''
   Another girl interrupted to say she was afraid to ride buses
with Palestinians because of recent firebomb and rock-throwing
attacks in Jerusalem. Others denounced Palestinians as
``terrorists.''
   Arab pupils at the Palestinian Medhamiya Girls' High School,
just a mile down the road from Rene Cassin, never mingle with the
Jewish students although their schools and homes are near each
other.
   At Medhamiya, in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, teacher Randa
Nusseibeh, a Palestinian, spoke generally about the roots of the
Arab-Israeli conflict to her 11th graders. She said the United
States and Britain helped Jews create a homeland in Palestine in
1948.
   ``What colonialism and the Jews want is to create tension in the
area,'' Mrs. Nusseibeh told the class.
   After class, pupil Randa Takash told a reporter she wanted the
Israelis to ``go back to where they came from.''
   But, in contrast with the Israeli students, the Palestinian
students did not debate the current problems in the occupied
territories or what should be done about them.
   School officials say Palestinian teachers discuss the uprising
only indirectly, fearing they could be accused of inciting violence
and their schools would be closed.
   In some Israeli classes, pupils have been asked to express their
feelings by drawing, said Tova Tsur, an adviser at the Education
Ministry who coordinates the program on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Eighth-graders in one Tel Aviv classroom drew pictures of
soldiers toting guns or Palestinians wielding knives, Mrs. Tsur
said in an interview.
   One drawing, she said, was of an airplane taking off with
Israelis on board. Mrs. Tsur said the drawing dramatized studies
that indicate many young Israelis want to leave the country.
   Mrs. Tsur said a new ministry booklet advises high school
teachers to assign literature by Palestinian refugees and to
instruct classes that Palestinians like Israelis have ``a strong
emotional tie to the Land of Israel.''
   But she added that many teachers cited deep emotional
involvement in the conflict as one reason they hesitate to comply
with government instructions about teaching the Arab-Israeli
conflict.

<HEAD>Economists Differ On When Trade Deficit Will Vanish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It hasn't happened since 1975, but some year the
United States will once again export more than it imports. The
question is: When?
   The dollar leaped Friday as currency traders decided the nation
was making rapid progress toward wiping out the trade deficit. The
optimism was spawned by a government report that the May deficit
was a relatively low $10.9 billion.
   But currency traders are notoriously short-term forecasters, far
more interested in the next tick of the dollar-yen exchange rate
than the outlook for trade in the 1990s.
   And in a strange twist, trade improvement is likely to be set
back in the long run because of the very rise in the dollar that
has come from expectations that trade will improve. A higher dollar
makes U.S. products less competitive in world markets.
   Including Friday's jump, the dollar has ascended 9 percent
against the West German mark and 7 percent against the Japanese yen
since June 10.
   Cautious American companies have just begun aggressively
pursuing export opportunities made possible by the lower dollar,
and some could back off if they feel the dollar's rise is going to
last.
   Moreover, foreign companies that were about to be dislodged from
the U.S. market might decide to hang on a bit longer because of the
dollar's rise.
   For both those reasons, ``It's terribly important to keep the
dollar down,'' Richard O'Brien of London-based American Express
Bank Ltd. said in a recent interview.
   While May's deficit was the second smallest in nearly three
years, imports still exceeded exports by 41 percent. Small,
incremental changes cannot quickly wipe out a gap of that size.
   Some economists, the optimists, say the switch from red ink to
black ink on the trade ledgers could happen on a monthly basis by
late next year and on an annual basis by 1990.
   ``Our advantage is, we can export literally thousands of
products. We're not uni-dimensional,'' said one of the optimists,
Thomas Carpenter, vice president and director of economics for ASB
Capital Management in Washington.
   ``Given the weak dollar we can sell anything from basic
materials to agricultural products to Boeing aircraft to
automobiles and computer software products. We've got it,'' he said.
   ``We will see the results and we'll see it in spades,'' said
Charles Reeder, who runs a forecasting firm in Wilmington, Del.,
and says the benefits of the dollar's long-term decline have been
underestimated.
   The economists spoke before the last leg of the dollar's rise
late this past week.
   Other economists say the first annual merchandise trade surplus
will not come until nearly the end of the century because the
torrid pace of export growth is bound to slow down.
   Exports will grow close to 7 percent annually over the next
decade, while imports grow about 2 percent a year, predicts the Wea
Group, in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., which predicts merchandise trade will
not flip to a surplus until 1997.
   The percentage differential between export and import growth
``just chews away at the surplus year by year,'' said Wefa's Glenn
Forman.
   The vastly different forecasts for zero day, the day when
exports finally catch up with imports, is a sign of the
inexactitude of economics. Trade isn't measured by the day, anyway.
Picking the year is probably the best anyone can expect.
   Wefa Group is one of the few organizations willing to make
forecasts, even tentative ones, for a decade ahead.
   ``There's definitely a limit to what we can reasonably
project,'' said Stacy Kottman of Georgia State's Economic
Forecasting Center, which declines to make forecasts much past next
year.
   ``Small, unanticipated changes _ say, if the dollar continues to
rally _ then that will dampen the progress we make against the
merchandise trade deficit,'' he said.
   The Georgia State group predicts the trade deficit will still be
averaging $8 billion to $9 billion a month next summer.
   Thrift is a virtue, and trade surpluses would allow the nation
to begin digging itself out of its status as the world's biggest
debtor. But economists don't even agree whether it is important to
vanquish the deficit or worry about debtor status.
   ``I believe that the reasons for the trade deficit are much more
fundamentally positive than many would have us believe,'' said
Brian Wesbury, an economist for Harris Trust and Savings Bank in
Chicago.
   Wesbury argues the trade deficit is a byproduct of foreigners'
strong desire to invest in the United States. America's high
technology and rapid productivity growth make it an attractive
place to sink money, and foreigners are paying for their
investments by shipping their goods here, he said.
   ``The more we move away from free-market policies and a low tax
environment, the sooner we'll get to that zero situation. But we'd
end up hurting our economy, hurting productivy, making this a less
attractive place to invest,'' Wesbury said.
   Shrinking the deficit to zero may easily take another decade,
Wesbury said, and he is in no hurry to see it happen sooner.
   Even economists who are more concerned about the deficit don't
think it will _ or should _ shrink too rapidly.
   Consider that most of the increase in shipments of manufactured
goods has come from making better use of existing plants. With
factories churning near their full practical capacity and the labor
market tightening, exports cannot continue to expand rapidly
without severe inflationary strains.
   ``The market swings from overpessimism to excessive optimism. We
awkwardly find ourselves on the `Let's cool it, folks' side, having
been bulls on the side of an export boom,'' O'Brien of American
Express Bank said.

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress the
central bank stands ready to push interest rates higher to stem
inflation. Major banks followed with a half-percent increase in the
prime rate to 9.5 percent.
   _The goverment said the nation's trade deficit expanded only
slightly in May and inflation remained moderate in June. Other

<HEAD>Greenspan Keeps Them Guessing on Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alan Greenspan has made his intentions clear to
Wall Street: The Federal Reserve either will, or will not, tighten
credit further in the weeks ahead.
   Making his midsummer appearance before a congressional committee
on Wednesday, the Fed chairman expressed a goodly measure of
concern about the prospect of increased inflation if economic
growth begins to strain the capacity of production facilities and
the labor force.
   As a result, he said, the central bank ``might be well advised
to err more on the side of restrictiveness rather than of
stimulus.''
   At the same time, however, he said higher interest rates were
not inevitable, and indicated he was in no rush to raise the
discount rate _ the rate the Fed charges on loans to private
financial institutions, and one of its most visible tools for
influencing trends in money and credit.
   The next morning, a headline in one major newspaper declared
``Greenspan Signals Higher Interest Rates,'' while another
reported, ``Greenspan Sees Stable Rates.''
   All in a day's work for Wall Street's Fed watchers. The job
description for the top job at the Fed stresses the ability to talk
before Congress for long periods of time without saying much of
anything.
   Some find this sort of thing offensive, arguing that an
organization with as much power as the Fed should be more
accountable to the citizenry and their elected representatives in a
democracy.
   But defenders of the present way of doing things say that
whoever speaks for the Fed is obliged to choose his words
carefully, if only because of the financial markets' tendency
toward emotional overreaction.
   In order to pursue its policies effectively, they say, the Fed
must keep a close eye on how the bond market, in particular, is
behaving.
   Suppose, for example, that the Fed sought to ease credit and
lower interest rates in circumstances that bond traders saw as
potentially inflationary. They would then tend to push interest
rates up, not down.
   The stock market behaved through the past week as if it had
learned nothing startlingly new about the Fed's intentions. Prices
meandered in a narrow range, and the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials closed Friday at 2,129.45, up 23.30 points from the
week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose .84 to 153.65;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
.26 to 394.59; and the American Stock Exchange market value index
increased .29 at 309.31.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 175.20 million shares a day,
against 163.40 in the previous week.
   As circumspect as he was about the future, Greenspan did confirm
that the Fed took a series of steps during the spring toward
tighter credit when it became increasingly clear that the economy
was stronger than expected.
   ``Skepticism about the Fed's resolve to resist inflationary
pressures persists,'' observed David Resler, economist at Nomura
Securities International, in a midyear appraisal of the outlook.
   ``Many suspect that the Fed will be too slow to take necessary
action against inflation during the election year.''
   However, Resler said, ``the three credit tightening moves that
the Fed took over an eight-week span in the second quarter ought to
assuage fears that the Fed will not respond quickly and decisively
to inflation pressures whenever they surface.
   ``Moreover, the financial markets' hypersensitivity to signs of
inflation renders fruitless any attempt to steer the economy along
an unwarranted growth path.''

   Singer Olivia Newton-John covers Australia,
from the Sydney Harbor Bridge to the vast, dusty outback, in her
HBO special, a musical salute to the 200th anniversary of the
nation down under.
   ``We were in the desert and it was 115 in the shade,'' she said.
``They'd squirt me with a water gun and I'd be dry in 10 seconds.
Then we went to Tasmania and took a full orchestra down into a
cave. It was freezing cold.
   ``Australians joke about Tasmania. It's an island at the bottom
of the country. It's very small. But it is so beautiful. I did a
song at the old prison colony at Port Arthur on the island. It's
right on the ocean and had no windows, and Tasmania is so close to
the Antarctic Circle.''
   The one-hour special, ``HBO World Stage: Olivia Newton-John in
Australia'' premieres Saturday on Home Box Office.
   ``I've always wanted to do a special in Australia,'' said
Newton-John. ``It seemed like a great time to do it because of the
bicentennial.''
   Newton-John was born in England and moved with her family to
Australia when she was 5. ``I left at the age of 15 when I won a
talent contest,'' she said. ``The prize was a trip to England. I
came here from England about 14 years ago. My mother and dad and
brother still live in Australia. I own an avocado farm in New South
Wales.''
   This is the second HBO special for Newton-John, who is probably
best known for such movies as ``Grease,'' ``Xanadu'' and ``Two of a
Kind'' and her hit video ``Physical.'' She starred in a 1983 HBO
special, ``Standing Room Only: Olivia Newton-John in Concert.''
   For this special, she said, ``We covered 6,000 miles in six
weeks. Australia is so vast and there are so many places to shoot,
the director had to scout locations. He had blue skies when he
scouted the areas. Then the skies turned gray and it rained when we
filmed. We had to shoot anyway because we had so little time.''
   The special contains songs from her new album, ``Rumour,'' which
will be out in August. She wrote four of the 10 songs on the album
and is recording an extra song for the special.
   ``We were in Sydney Harbor for the opening of the
bicentennial,'' she said. ``We got a one-second shot of Prince
Charles on his boat. That was the most incredible day of my life.
There must have been 10,000 boats in the harbor.
   ``We were on an Australia destroyer, HMS Hobart. We filmed me
singing on the ship, in the showers, in the mess, all over the ship
with the men. Throughout the special we use all real people. There
are no actors. I just asked questions. I got a lot of different
answers to the same questions.''
   The special also takes her to the beaches, a wildlife park,
Melbourne, the outback, a fireworks display in Sydney Harbor, a
sheep-shearing, and a talk with locals at a ``Crocodile
Dundee''-style bar.
   One place she didn't visit for the special was the Great Barrier
Reef. A storm kept them away during her last days in Australia.
   She still spends a lot of time in Australia, where ``George and
Madge'' run the avocado farm.
   ``It's semi-tropical and very humid,'' she said. ``The soil is
red with a lot of minerals. You have to cut the grass twice a week
in the growing season. I keep a garden when I'm there. We planted
some cuttings two years ago and now they're hedges 6 feet tall.
There are some giant fig trees in a nearby rain forest. One of the
giant trees is the one Captain Cook saw from his ship in the
1700s.''
   She is married to actor Matt Lattanzi and they have a
2{-year-old daughter, Chloe Rose. Lattanzi was in the movies ``My
Tutor'' and ``Blueberry Hill'' and is due to start a movie for
Disney at the end of July.
   Newton-John and business partner Pat Farrar have 15 stores that
feature Australian products and their own line of clothing. Each
Koala Blue store also has a milk bar that sells Australia milk
shakes, which are thinner than American shakes.
   ``We started with Australian imports,'' she said, ``then we
began designing our own line of clothes. We use Australian-designed
fabrics and the vivid colors you see in Australia.''
   She and her family were due to leave for London where she was to
do the post-production work on the special with British director
Brian Grant. Her husband will go on to Spain where ``Blueberry
Hill'' is being shown in a film festival.
   Her own film career has been on hold since the birth of her
daughter. Her last movie, ``Two of a Kind,'' was a box office and
critical flop in 1983. She and a friend have written a screenplay,
though, that they hope to get filmed.

<HEAD>Job Growth: Too Much of a Good Thing?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the stock and bond markets have made clear
lately, Wall Street investors have very mixed feelings about the
strong employment growth that has occurred this year.
   Providing jobs, of course, is one of the basic goals of economic
policymakers.
   So when the unemployment rate falls to a 14-year low, as it did
in June, something obviously is going right.
   The question facing investors, however, is whether and when
gains in employment become too much of a good thing _ reaching a
point where the capacity of the labor force is strained, unleashing
new inflationary forces.
   On that point, the views of Wall Street economists diverge
widely. Some say the danger point is close at hand, while others
argue that circumstances allow for plenty more growth.
   The optimists point out that while nonfarm payroll employment
grew by 346,000 in June, the Labor Department's measure of hourly
wages actually declined.
   Nevertheless, argues Allen Sinai, economist at the Boston Co.
and Economic Advisers Inc., ``this is still no great comfort on
inflation worries, since economic and labor market strength
typically comes first and then inflationary pressures second, with
some lag.
   ``With so much strength in labor markets and such low
unemployment rates, it is hard to think that wage inflation will
not keep accelerating.''
   David Levine, economist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., points
out that payments to employees make up about two-thirds of the
costs businesses incur in this country.
   ``Unemployment has clearly entered the realm that was associated
with wage and price problems in the early and late 1970s,'' he
maintains.
   ``While wage growth remains quite temperate by the standards of
those years, it has now begun to accelerate.
   ``Assuming, as we do, that above consensus growth (in the gross
national product) will continue to pull down the unemployment rate,
the labor market seems likely to become tighter than at any time
since 1973 and wage pressures should intensify.''
   Levine says he is looking for wage increases in the 6 to 7
percent range next year.
   By contrast, Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache
Securities, contends that times have changed in ways that allow for
further job growth without a big increase in inflation.
   In the 1970s and the early 1980s, he says, the baby-boom
generation born after World War II moved into the labor force in
huge numbers. The unemployment rate and inflation both rose.
   Now, because of the ``birth dearth'' in the 1960s, he says
demographic forces are working in the opposite direction.
   Yardeni predicts that the unemployment rate, now at 5.3 percent,
will get as low as 4 percent by 1990, or maybe sooner.
   ``If the unemployment rate is heading toward 4 percent, doesn't
that suggest much higher wage inflation ahead? Not necessarily,''
he says.
   ``We've argued that labor-saving, productivity-enhancing capital
spending is the only intelligent way that corporate America can
respond to the labor shortage.
   ``Of course, they could start a bidding war. But that way
they'll get costlier workers, not more workers. In our opinion,
corporate managers are unlikely to suddenly offer big wage hikes
after they spent five years cutting costs.
   ``The corporate culture of the 1980s (and 1990s) emphasizes cost
cutting. Price increases were fashionable in the 1970s. Global and
domestic pressures suggest that a return to the inflationary
culture of the 1970s is unlikely.''

<HEAD>Institutional Investors Form Bondholder Protection Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's no secret that bondholders usually get the
short end of the stick when it comes to things like corporate
takeovers or restructurings.
   Unlike stock prices that often skyrocket even at the hint of a
merger, corporate paper usually suffers as bondholders worry about
a company being saddled with additional debt once a deal is
completed.
   And unlike stockholders who have final say over such a deal,
bondholders are relegated to a passive, non-voting role.
   A group of investors, though, is working to change that through
the recently formed Institutional Bondholders' Rights Association.
   The fledgling group, believed to be the first of its kind, has
two goals: to help institutional investors respond promptly to
specific situations threatening the value of debt investments; and
to develop basic means for protecting the interests of
institutional investors, association president Richard S. Swingle
explained in a recent interview.
   ``Widespread corporate restructuring _ including mergers and
acquisitions, management buyouts and bankruptcy reorganizations _
has underscored the need for an organization that will help
safeguard the interests of institutional bondholders,'' Swingle
said.
   ``Recently, it has become typical for a corporation to finance a
restructuring by drastically increasing its debt load. Often the
result is a reduction in the credit quality of existing corporate
debt held by institutions,'' he said.
   Eight companies have joined the association since its inception
earlier this month, among them: Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.,
Prudential Life Insurance Co. of America and Loomis, Sayles & Co.,
all holders of billions of dollars in corporate debt.
   The association, looking for more strength in numbers, hopes to
have at least 25 members in a year and up to 100 in the next three
to four years.
   Swingle, who is also a vice president at T. Rowe Price
Associates Inc., said that as specific situations arise the
association will assist institutional investors in taking the
appropriate action.
   For example, he said, the group may develop a set of provisions
to insert in corporate debt agreements that would guarantee
institutional investor rights. Such provisions would assure that no
corporate transaction could benefit shareholders at the expense of
bondholders.
   In addition, Swingle said, the association might form ad hoc
bondholder groups to negotiate terms or defeat an asset sale, or
work with a corporation's management to preserve existing debt
value in a reorganization.
   ``By helping institutions respond cooperatively to specific
restructuring situations _ and by building explicit protection for
institutions into corporate debt agreements _ we hope to guarantee
that rights of institutional investors are afforded greater
consideration when a corporation alters its financial structure,''
Swingle said.

<HEAD>Mexico Criticizes OPEC Oil Production Overruns</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subroto without first name is cq.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAVIER PICHARDINI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday criticized
production overruns by some OPEC members that have allowed crude
oil prices to drop on the world market in recent weeks.
   Mexico's view was contained in a message which Energy and Mines
Secretary Fernando Hiriart sent the newly named general secretary
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Subroto of
Indonesia.
   He said in the message that the international cartel's failure
to adhere to its own, agreed upon export quotas is undermining the
market.
   ``This has prevented crude prices from reaching the expected
levels because of over-production in export platforms,'' the
message released here said.
   Mexico, the world's sixth largest oil exporter, is not a member
of the 13-nation cartel, but it has often cooperated with OPEC by
restricting sales abroad and following its pricing guidelines.
   ``Mexico has actively supported OPEC's measures to stabilize the
international petroleum market and these unilateral decisions were
taken within a context where cooperation and discipline were to be
expected by all members of the cartel's exporters of
hydrocarbons,'' the message said.
   Subroto is expected to arrive in Mexico City on Aug. 17 to
discuss with officials here measures to stabilize the market and
boost prices. Crude oil is this country's principal source of
export earnings.
   Mexico produces an average of 2.5 million barrels of crude a
day, and exports 1.36 million barrels _ about half of it to the
United States. It used to export 1.5 million barrels daily two
years ago, but reduced the amount in order to help keep prices up.

<HEAD>Trade Report Bolsters Dollar; Wholesale Prices Up Moderately</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An encouraging report on the U.S. trade deficit has helped
catapult the dollar to recent highs against several key foreign
currencies.
   The Commerce Department reported Friday that the United States
posted a $10.9 billion trade deficit in May, the second smallest
shortfall in almost three years.
   The news helped the dollar make its best showing since October
against the British pound. The pound finished at $1.6605 in late
New York trading, far cheaper than Thursday's $1.6875.
   The dollar's surge lifted bond prices, pushing interest rates
lower. The yield on the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond
slipped to 9.14 percent from 9.17 percent late Thursday.
   The favorable trade news also sparked a moderate gain in stock
prices on Wall Street. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
15.83 points to 2,129.45, finishing the week with a net gain of
23.30.
   In another key economic report, the Labor Department said
wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in June _ but analysts
saw cause for worry in the steep, drought-induced climb in raw food
prices.
   The hot, dry weather searing much of the nation sent prices of
unprocessed grain and poultry soaring by more than 20 percent last
month, pushing raw food prices 4.2 percent higher than in May. It
was the biggest jump since October 1985.
   Grain futures closed mixed while soybeans posted strong gains on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid conflicting weather forecasts for
the drought-stricken Farm Belt.
   In other economic developments Friday:
   _The Federal Reserve reported that U.S. industrial production,
boosted by heavy demand for electricity during the summer heat
wave, climbed 0.4 percent in June, the ninth consecutive month
without a decline.
   _The Commerce Department said business inventories climbed in
May for the 17th consecutive month. Sales also rose strongly,
easing economists' worries that too many goods are accumulating on
shelves and back lots.
   The Reagan administration and private economists were in
agreement that the May trade report offered conclusive proof that
the government's efforts to deal with one of the country's biggest
economic problems, a seemingly intractable trade deficit, were
beginning to show results.
   The May deficit was actually $627 million higher than a revised
April imbalance of $10.3 billion. But the April figure was the
smallest imbalance since a $9.9 billion deficit in August 1985 and
the May deficit was the second smallest imbalance since that time.
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity noted that for the first
five months of this year, U.S. exports have surged by 31 percent
compared with the same period in 1987, reflecting the boom
conditions in the nation's manufacturing brought on by the weaker
dollar.
   ``The merchandise trade figures for May are consistent with the
trend toward a lower trade deficit,'' Verity said. ``The
improvement in the trade balance in the first five months has been
widespread geographically.''
   The administration launched an effort three years ago with major
U.S. allies to devalue the dollar as a way of making American goods
more competitive on overseas markets.

<HEAD>Pan Am Reaches Agreement with Transport Workers</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>

   Financially pressed Pan Am Corp. has moved a
step closer to its goal of recovery by reaching a tentative labor
agreement with leaders of its largest union.
   The Transport Workers union agreed Friday to freeze wages,
prompting Pan Am to withdraw its recent threat to sell a large
portion of its assets. The airline, engaged in sporadic talks with
the Transport Workers since last February, originally had sought a
10 percent cut in wages.
   The agreement, covering about 5,200 mechanics, aircraft service
personnel and flight dispatchers, still must be ratified by the
union membership. It would save the airline around $81 million over
the next three years, according to both the union and Pan Am.
   ``This is a crucial development in Pan Am's plan for financial
recovery,'' Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said in a statement.
   The Transport Workers union is the third out of the five unions
at Pan Am to sign a new cost-saving contract with the carrier,
which is seeking $90 million in wage reductions from its flight
attendants and has imposed $35 million in cuts on the Teamsters
under federal labor rules.
   Pan Am said it will now direct its efforts toward reaching an
accord with the flight attendants.
   The airline's management believes it needs around $540 million
over three years in pay cuts and other labor concessions to turn
itself around. Last spring, the two unions representing pilots and
flight engineers at Pan Am agreed to cuts totaling about $240
million over three years.
   Teamsters leader William Genoese said the new agreement with the
Transport Workers didn't change his union's position.
Representatives of the Pan Am flight attendants weren't immediately
available for comment.
   ``The whole thing is a farce; the company is going down the
tubes,'' Genoese, director of the Teamsters' airline division, told
The Associated Press. ``We're in a position to strike the company
... we're going to fight `em tooth-and-nail.''
   Because Pan Am softened its position with the transport workers
and accepted a wage freeze rather than a cut, Genoese asserted,
``They've got to soften their position with everybody.''
   Last February, Teamsters leaders vowed ``guerrilla warfare''
against Pan Am _ including deliberate diversion of baggage _ after
a strike deadline passed. The 4,500-member Teamsters at Pan Am
include reservation clerks, baggage handlers and other ground staff.
   Pan Am, the nation's eighth largest airline, lost $265.3 million
last year. Earlier this year it replaced top management in return
for the concessions from the pilots and flight engineers.

   Crude and heating oil prices rose but gasoline
prices declined in light pre-weekend trading that brokers
attributed largely to internal market influences.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August-delivery price
for West Texas Intermediate advanced 10 cents a barrel on Friday to
$14.86.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale No. 2
heating oil rose 0.21 cent a gallon to 41.12 cents, and unleaded
gasoline fell 0.81 cent a gallon to 49.73 cents.
   Brokers said crude and heating oil prices rose partly from
short-covering, the purchase of contracts by speculators to replace
borrowed contracts they had sold earlier. Short-covering can cause
short-term price rises.
   Others attributed the advances partly to a tendency by many
traders to reduce risky positions heading into a weekend. ``We've
got a lot of people squaring up their books,'' said Peter Beutel,
assistant director at Elders Futures Inc., a New York
energy-futures trading concern.
   Traders said the decline in gasoline came from pre-weekend
profit taking. Contrary to recent declines in oil prices, gasoline
has been rising sharply because of unprecedented demand and tight
supplies in the United States.
