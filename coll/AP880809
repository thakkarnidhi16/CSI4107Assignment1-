<HEAD>Spider Mites Threaten Drought-Stressed Soybean Crops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drought-weary farmers who are pinning
their hopes on soybeans now face another threat: tiny, hungry mites
that like dry weather and can go unnoticed while destroying crops.
   State agriculture officials say spider mites are invading
soybean fields in Michigan and other drought-plagued Midwest states.
   ``It's a difficult critter to fight because they're hard to see
with the naked eye,'' said Doug Landis, a field crops entomologist
at Michigan State University.
   ``When a crop looks bad, it's blamed on other things _ mostly
the drought. It's not until the problem becomes severe that the
mites are discovered,'' Landis said Monday.
   The mites, which thrive in dry, hot conditions, feed on the
underside of plant leaves by piercing plant cells and extracting
the sap, Landis said. After a few days, the leaves bear yellow
speckles and eventually turn brown or bronze.
   ``Entire fields can be completely lost if spider mites are not
controlled and weather conditions allow them to build up
populations,'' Landis said. The eight-legged pests are easily
carried on the wind from field to field.
   ``It's just another thing you've got to fight,'' said farmer
Larry Bennett of Fulton, who recently discovered mites in his
soybean field.
   The infestation is potentially another serious blow to farmers
who have lost much of their corn crop in the drought and were
hoping to cut their losses with soybeans, which are bringing in
higher prices.
   Because farmers in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota
also are combating the mites, there has been a shortage of
pesticides to kill the pests, Landis said.
   ``We are running at capacity in an attempt to meet the
stepped-up demand,'' Dow Chemical Co. spokesman Sam Barrick said of
the production of one such pesticide, Lorsban 4 E. ``The demand has
been so great for the product we're just running out of product.''

   Tropical storm Beryl was downgraded to a
tropical depression Tuesday after moving inland and weakening,
leaving one person missing in the Gulf of Mexico but raising hopes
that its remnants could bring rain to drought-stricken Midwest
farmers.
   The Coast Guard rescued six people who endured two days of wind
and rain on an island after high seas prevented them from returning
to the mainland.
   There was virtually no damage in southern Louisiana except for
some spot flooding and tree limbs blown down. Scattered damage was
reported in southern Mississippi, including downed tree limbs and
scattered power outages.
   In New Orleans, where preparations continued for next week's
Republican National Convention, few problems developed from the
storm.
   ``The beneficial aspects of this tropical storm are probably
much greater than any negative effects from this system _ and
that's rain,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Shortly before 5 p.m. CDT, forecasters downgraded the storm to a
tropical depression as its highest sustained wind speed dropped to
35 mph; a storm is designated a tropical storm when wind speed hits
39 mph.
   The storm's center was just west-southwest of Baton Rouge by
9:30 p.m., and was expected to continue moving slowly northwest,
the National Weather Service said.
   Seas of 7 to 10 feet were expected to drop behind the storm,
forecasters said. Although the storm was not producing widespread
rain, there was a danger of flooding from locally heavy storms, the
weather service said.
   Flooding was reported in Mississippi in low areas and along
overflowing rivers and streams. About 150 people in Harrison County
were forced to move to higher ground Tuesday because of river
flooding, said Linda Rouse, deputy director for Harrison County
Civil Defense. ``We have people on all of the rivers'' monitoring
the levels.
   Beryl, the Atlantic storm season's second named tropical storm,
still had the potential of moving back over the Gulf, where it
would gain strength from the warm water, but forecasters said that
was unlikely.
   ``We think it's going to go on a more west track, west
northwest, then turn toward the northwest up over the Midwest
area,'' Sheets said. ``We don't think it's going to go back out
over the water so there's not much chance of it ever strengthening
again.''
   Thousands of workers from the marshes and offshore oil rigs were
evacuated Monday as a precaution, and tourists abandoned the
Mississippi and Alabama coasts.
   The Coast Guard suspended a search Tuesday for a 15-year-old boy
who fell overboard when a 24-foot fishing boat capsized near
Dauphin Island off the coast of Alabama.
   The youth, whose name was not given, was reported missing
Tuesday by a survivor found clinging to the hull of a vessel that
capsized Monday in the Mississippi Sound. Searchers believe the
boat was swamped by seven-foot waves.
   Although Beryl barely bruised Alabama's coastline, 11.6 inches
of rain was reported at Dauphin Island for the 24-hour period
ending at 7 a.m. Tuesday.
   The Coast Guard rescued six people who went camping Sunday on
Petit Bois Island, south of Pasagoula, Miss., when the forecast was
for mostly sunny weather. That night, the weather turned bad and
the water became too choppy to travel back to the mainland.
   ``We lost one of the tents,'' Mrs. Randy Gibson said. ``We
patched the other with garbage bags and anything else we could
find. We exhausted everything we had.''
   ``We haven't slept since Sunday,'' she said after being rescued
Tuesday. ``We haven't been dry since then.''
   Homes were evacuated east of New Orleans in the St. Bernard
Parish fishing villages of Hopedale, Yscloskey and Shell Beach.
   In Lafourche Parish, authorities readied eight evacuation
centers Monday, but seven of the centers remained closed Tuesday,
the eighth was unoccupied and parish officials said they expected
few problems with the storm.

<HEAD>Countdown Set to Begin Tonight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new countdown begins tonight for a
22-second firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines, a
vital test that has been postponed five times because of
malfunctions.
   If this test succeeds, NASA officials will set a date for the
first American manned space flight since the Challenger burst into
flames on liftoff in January 1986. The Discovery launch date,
already officially moved four times, is not likely to be before
October because of all the test delays.
   The flight readiness firing, as it's called, is an overall
workout of the main engines, computer software, ground support
equipment, communications lines and the launch teams.
   The ``call to stations'' that begins the countdown was scheduled
for 6:10 p.m. with the test set for 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. Without
further problems, fueling of the shuttle's huge tank begins a half
hour before midnight.
   The shuttle's No. 2 engine is fitted with a new ``hydrogen bleed
valve'' and sensor to replace units that caused a scheduled test to
be scrapped last Thursday in the split second before the start of
ignition.
   ``The recovery from the problem on Thursday shows that the team
is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on
Wednesday morning,'' said Hugh Harris, a spokesman for NASA's
Kennedy Space Center.
   Discovery's three engines will be fired with slightly different
start and stop times, using only a portion of the half million
gallons of fuel in the external tank.
   Bolts 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter hold the shuttle to
the pad while the engines generate 1.1 million pounds of thrust.
   The two solid fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank
will not be ignited but will be subjected to the same bending
movements that led to a leak in one of the joints during
Challenger's liftoff. That leak allowed flame to escape and led to
the shuttle's destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts.
   Flight readiness firings have been required in the past for new
shuttles only, except for one time when a malfunction made a retest
necessary. But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is
treating Discovery as an untried ship because of the long time
since the last flight and the many changes since the Challenger
disaster.
   Last Thursday's engine test was aborted in the last second when
a sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed
to. Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts.
   The designer of the shuttle rocket booster, meanwhile, announced
Monday that the last of five full-scale test-firings for the
booster will be held Aug. 18.
   The fifth in the series of firings of the 126-foot-long
redesigned rocket will be conducted at Morton Thiokol Inc.'s
northern Utah plant.

<HEAD>Congress Works To Save Last Free Stretch of Columbia River</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Columbia River rolls
lazily through the desert of central Washington, nourishing crops
and wildlife in what otherwise would be a wasteland of sagebrush
and barren hills.
   The river, which once roared through deep gorges, was
immortalized in Woody Guthrie's Depression-era song ``Roll On,
Columbia'' _
   ``Green Douglas fir where the waters cut through,
   Down her wild mountains and canyons she flew,
   Canadian North-west to the ocean so blue,
   It's roll on, Columbia, roll on!''
   But after the construction of more than a dozen dams in 51
years, the Columbia has rolled nearly to a standstill. For much of
its 1,214 miles, the river is a series of dams and slackwater
reservoirs, providing electricity, irrigation and flood control for
Washington, Oregon and Canada.
   The United States claims one last free-flowing stretch _ the
55-mile Hanford Reach _ and it too is facing major development.
   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing a $180 million
project to open the river to barge traffic all the way to
Wenatchee, so that logs, wheat and apples from the state's interior
can be floated to Pacific Ocean ports.
   The plan calls for dredging part of the river and building giant
lifts over three dams to allow navigation between Richland and
Wenatchee.
   Opponents say the dredging would forever ruin valuable fish and
wildlife habitat, archaeological sites and the last vestige of
natural river flow.
   Washington's congressional delegation has introduced legislation
to protect the area.
   The reach ``is one of the only areas where spawning habitats
remain undisturbed, nesting areas abound, and majestic cliffs
lining the river are mirrored in its quiet, deep calm,'' said Sen.
Dan Evans, R-Wash.
   ``We're telling them don't go ahead with these ill-conceived
plans until we know the impact on spawning and recreation, the most
important use of the river,'' said Republican Rep. Sid Morrison,
whose district includes the area.
   Under the bill, the Department of the Interior would protect the
Hanford Reach for eight years until a study determines whether to
permanently preserve the stretch under the Wild and Scenic Rivers
Act.
   The bill has already cleared the Senate but Morrison has delayed
House action while negotiations continue to address concerns of the
U.S. Department of Energy.
   That agency operates the Hanford nuclear reservation, a
sprawling plutonium-production site that straddles the river. The
Energy Department is worried the study could hamper Hanford
operations, said Terry Seeley, a legislative aide to Morrison.
   There lies the irony of the ``wild and scenic'' designation: as
the Columbia flows past nine federal nuclear reactors no one would
call the view pastoral.
   The huge, eerie reactors, technological marvels in their time,
produced much of the plutonium for the nation's nuclear weapons
arsenal. The slow-moving river creeps past the hulking reactors,
with pumping stations, razor-wire fences and guard towers casting
shadows over the water.
   Eight are closed permanently. The newest, the N Reactor, which
was placed on ``cold standby'' earlier this year because the
federal government no longer needed the plutonium, stands closest
to the river, a brooding presence amid the jumping fish, herons and
deer.
   Much of the shore is off-limits to recreational users because
the federal government wanted a buffer zone around its reactors.
   The Hanford Reach runs from Priest Rapids Dam, south of Mattawa,
to the reservoir of McNary Dam just north of Richland.
   The biggest objections to the dredging are that the movement of
a half-million cubic yards of dirt would destroy some of the last
wild runs of chinook salmon, which battle their way up river to
spawn.
   ``That's one of the few or perhaps the only remaining natural
spawning area in that entire river system below Grand Coulee (dam)
that salmon and steelhead can get too,'' said Jerry Neal, deputy
director the state Department of Wildlife.
   The Army Corps of Engineers has proposed building an artificial
salmon spawning channel, to compensate for areas lost to dredging.
But opponents say that would not work.
   ``Artificial spawning channels just don't provide the quantity
and quality of reproduction that the natural free-flowing river
provides,'' Neal said. ``The technology hasn't been that
well-perfected.''
   The dredging proposal has also run into stiff fiscal opposition.
   The cost-benefit ratio for the project currently stands at just
80 cents in benefits for every dollar spent, said George Sellar,
manager of water resources for the Port of Chelan County in
Wenatchee, which has been pushing the plan since the 1950s.
   The port and the Army are now studying the plan to try to make
it economically stronger.
   For instance, some people feel that large quantities of apples
could not be moved by barge because of the length of the trip, but
others say using refrigerated containers would keep them fresh,
Sellar said.
   The port hopes to save up to 40 percent in transportation costs
compared to rail or trucking. ``One barge will move the equivalent
of 50 to 60 trucks,'' Sellar said.

   A distaste for turning lambs into chops
has transformed a sewage treatment plant into a haven for sheep,
chickens, geese, rabbits and, as their keeper puts it, ``whatever
people throw over the fence.''
   The creatures live on the 107-acre spread of the Upper
Blackstone Water Pollution Abatement District amid tanks, pipes,
pools, pumps, an incinerator and plenty of grass for grazing.
   Emil Holland, plant director, recalls that in the spring of 1978
a farmer was allowed to leave two lambs there to fatten up on the
plant's grassy field.
   By the time the farmer returned in the fall, plant employees had
grown attached to the lambs and pleaded that they be spared their
fate as shish kebab. So, the sewage district board voted to buy the
sheep from the farmer. Soon, more creatures arrived unannounced,
apparently abandoned by their owners.
   ``We'd come in the morning and one day we had 12 geese,''
Holland said Monday. ``The next day we had 12 ducks, then four
chickens.''
   On Monday, the ``community,'' as Holland describes it, included
three sheep, two dozen geese, two dozen chickens and roosters _
``we get a lot of roosters'' _ and uncounted rabbits and pigeons.
   The animals drink from a fountain that carries clean water. They
also have the run of two huts, and staff at the sewage plant feed
them grain.
   Motorists stop every day to look, Holland said, and some leave
with a pet. ``We give them away to anybody who asks,'' Holland
said, ``as long as they're not going to eat them.''

   State officials wanted a big check from
Victor H. Bourre for back taxes, and that's what they got. Bourre
handed then a check measuring 7 inches by 14 inches, or more than
twice the standard size.
   ``It's a perfectly legitimate check,'' said Bourre, a Dover,
N.H., resident and a opponent of a Maine law that requires him to
pay Maine income taxes because he works at the Portsmouth Naval
Shipyard.
   The shipyard is on an island in the Piscataqua River between New
Hampshire and Maine and is connected by a bridge to Kittery, Maine.
   Maine state Treasurer Samuel Shapiro agreed that the check,
printed on thick brown paper, was legal tender.
   Shapiro's deputy, Maurice F. Stickney, deposited the $981.12
payment in a bank Monday afternoon.
   Bourre, 40, said Monday that a friend arranged for a printing
shop to blow up a check. He said he wanted to make it 4 feet by 8
feet, but ``that's the biggest I could get made up right away.''
   Bourre said he had withheld payment during a legal challenge by
shipyard workers. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case.

   Iran and Iraq say they will accept a cease-fire.
The U.N. peace plan appears to be under way and there is hope the
8-year-old war in the Persian Gulf will end soon. Here is a report
on the human and material cost.

<TEXT>
   For eight years, Iran and Iraq sent their
youth to slaughter, squandered their wealth and mortaged their
futures in a war that gained nothing for either side.
   Children as young as 13, eagerly seeking a martyr's death,
perished as sacrificial mine sweepers. Children, parents and
grandparents were blown to bits or crippled by bombs, shells and
missiles in the cities of both sides. Soldiers and civilians were
maimed by poison warfare.
   In all, more than 1 million people were killed or wounded. The
war cost hundreds of billions of dollars and caused measureless
agony and grief.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, announced
Monday in New York that the two enemies had agreed to end the war
with a cease-fire Aug. 20 and to begin peace negotiations Aug. 25
in Geneva.
   On the killing fields near the southern port of Basra, Iraqi
soldiers dug trenches and unreeled barbed wire for set-piece
battles reminiscent of World War I. Men and boys died by the
thousands in the mud and shallow water of the marshes.
   Iraq's official news media periodically reported a ``harvest of
the rotten heads.'' Foreign correspondents taken on guided tours
were shown heaps of Iranian bodies on the battlefield.
   Iran spoke of victories by its ``martyrdom-seeking'' soldiers
and Revolutionary Guards. The ranks were swollen by children
wearing ``Martyr'' T-shirts, pressed into the service of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's fundamentalist Islamic government.
   Sometimes it seemed the young men of Iraq commuted to battle, so
close was the front to many cities. They returned in coffins atop
automobiles moving in long processions.
   Iranians buried their dead in the Martyrs' Cemetery outside
Tehran, a huge graveyard whose centerpiece is a ``fountain of
blood'' spewing water dyed red.
   By Western estimates, the set-piece battles east of Basra in
January 1987 killed 25,000 Iranians and 10,000 Iraqis.
   All the casualty figures are estimates. Neither country provided
comprehensive numbers during the war, which began in September 1980
with border skirmishes followed by an Iraqi invasion across the
Shatt al-Arab, the waterway that forms the southern border.
   Anthony Cordesman says in his book ``The Iran-Iraq War and
Western Security,'' that at least 300,000 Iranians were killed and
600,000 wounded through 1987, with corresponding for Iraq of
120,000 and 300,000.
   He says the estimates are conservative, that by some accounts
the dead total 1 million and the wounded 1.7 million.
   By comparison, 2.9 million people were killed in the Korean war
and 2.4 million in Vietnam.
   Hundreds of billions of dollars were devoured by arms purchases,
lost revenues, damaged or destroyed buildings and industrial plants.
   War damage extended beyond Iran and Iraq. Lloyd's, the London
insurance exchange, reported 90 ships sunk or destroyed in the
Persian Gulf and 546 attacked, with at least 300 sailors killed and
300 injured.
   Ninety-three ships were trapped in Iraqi waterways throughout
the war, many of them written off. Lloyd's said its underwriters
paid more than $1 billion in ship claims and other insurers a like
amount.
   Iraq started the war with foreign exchange reserves of $35
billion and now owes an estimated $60 billion. Iran has not
borrowed but its foreign exchange reserves have declined to a few
billion dollars.
   La Tribune, an financial journal published in Paris, estimates
Iran needs $80 billion and Iraq $30 billion to rebuild
transportation, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and
hospitals.
   Evidence of the human cost is everywhere.
   ``Every family has been touched by the war,'' an accountant
named Abdullah told an Associated Press correspondent in Baghdad
earlier this month.
   ``They've all had a son or a brother killed or maimed or taken
prisoner,'' he said. ``Every family has one or more men in the
army.'' Two of Abdullah's sons were in the army and a third was at
home, minus a hand and a leg.
   Battle casualties include many children under 15 who ran into
mine fields with plastic ``keys to Paradise'' around their necks.
   French photographer Francois Lochon visited the front in 1984
and reported seeing the bodies of many dead children ``who were no
older than 12 or 14.''
   ``The skull shaved, wrapped in the red scarf of the martyrs, the
key to Paradise around the neck, they were scattered around the
rocky trenches or floating in the still waters,'' he said.
   Many other warriors shown on Iranian television appeared
elderly, with white hair and grins that showed few teeth. In Iraq,
President Saddam Hussein encouraged older citizens to join the
Popular Army militia.
   Thousands of civilians were killed by bombs and
surface-to-surface missiles that struck hospitals, schools and
residential areas in Tehran, Baghdad and other cities.
   Hundreds of missiles were fired in a round of the ``war of the
cities'' earlier this year.
   Iran reported 1,145 civilians killed and 4,000 wounded. Iraq did
not give casualty figures, but nearly 30 children were killed when
an Iranian missile hit a Baghdad school last year.
   Iraqi battlefield casualties have been only about one-quarter of
Iran's, but Iraq has only 16 million people compared to 45 million
in Iran and was conscious from the beginning of the need to avoid
heavy losses.
   It resorted to chemical weapons, which are banned by the 1925
Geneva Convention. U.N. reports say one of those weapons was
mustard gas, the scourge of the World War I trenches.
   Iran claimed 5,000 Kurds were killed and 5,000 wounded in a
chemical attack on the border town of Halabja in March. Foreign
reporters taken there saw many bodies, unmarked by wounds.
   Mohammed Azizi, a 25-year-old student, was in Halabja at the
time and said streets were strewn with the bodies of victims.
Doctors said they suspected mustard gas killed them.
   ``Any door you opened, there were children, men and women,
dying, dead,'' Azizi said.

   Turning the lights on for the first
night game at Chicago's Wrigley Field is forcing country music's
Statlers quartet to change the lyrics of their 7-year-old song
``Don't Wait On Me.''
   The lyrics of the 1981 song contain the phrase, ``When the
lights go on at Wrigley Field, I'll be coming home to you.''
   Although the recording, from the album ``Years Ago,'' can't be
changed, the group will substitute the line with, ``When they put a
dome on Wrigley Field, I'll be coming home to you'' in performances.
   ``That ought to keep us ahead of them for a few years,'' The
Statlers' Don Reid said from his home in Staunton, Va.
   ``It never crossed our minds that one day they would put lights
in Wrigley Field,'' said Reid, a baseball buff who wrote the song
with his brother and fellow group member, Harold Reid.

   The Iran-Iraq war cost hundreds of
billions of dollars in lost revenues, damaged and destroyed
buildings, industrial plants, ships and military equipment.
   Aside from the human toll, the economic cost to the combatants,
according to Israeli experts who followed the war closely, was more
than $200 billion through 1986. Nineteen months of further
devastation added to this figure.
   Other countries have lost as well. The London insurance firm,
Lloyd's, reports that in the Persian Gulf ``tanker war'' 90 ships
were sunk or destroyed and and 546 ships attacked, most of them
damaged.
   Another 93 ships have been trapped in Iraqi waterways since the
war began, many of them written off.
   Insurance losses paid out by Lloyd's on ship hulls has been more
than $1 billion. Other firms paid a similar amount, Lloyds said.
   Iraq started the war with foreign exchange reserves of $35
billion and now owes foreign countries an estimated $60 billion.
   Iran has avoided borrowing but has run down its foreign exchange
reserves to a few billion dollars.
   Iran and Iraq refused to give figures on losses, human, material
or economic.
   The Paris economic paper La Tribune, quoting Western economic
experts, says Iran needs $80 billion to rebuild transport
facilities, oil installations, housing, factories, schools and
hospitals. It said Iraq needs $30 billion for the same task.
   A report by Kiyotaki Tsuji of the Japanese institute of Middle
East Economic Studies estimated that damage to oil installations
alone, from bombing and shelling raids, amounted to $28 billion for
Iran and $8 billion for Iraq.
   Estimates of military equipment purchases for the war, above
normal pre-war expenditures vary, from $25 billion to $40 billion
for Iran and from $35 billion to $70 billion for Iraq. Paying,
feeding and treating wounded soldiers added billions more to war
expenditures.
   Losses in oil revenues, estimated by Tsuji, are $23 billion for
Iran and $65 billion for Iraq. Pre-war production in Iraq was 3.6
million barrels a day. It fell to 1.2 million barrels a day in 1981
and gradually has been built back to 2.7 million barrels a day.
   Iraqi bombing raids decimated Iran's refining capacity from 1.3
million barrels a day pre-war, to 400,000 barrels a day, forcing
the Iranians to import petroleum products costing $1.5 million a
year, oil experts here estimated.
   Iraqi raids damaged or put out of action Iranian refineries at
Abadan, Isfahan, Shiraz, Tehran and Bakhtaran. The billion-dollar
oil loading facility at Kharg island is virtually destroyed.
Iranians wrecked Iraq's oil shipping terminal at Faw.
   Construction in Iran has stopped because of Iraqi bombing at a
major petrochemical plant being built with Japanese help at Bandar
Khomeini, at the huge gas collection and treatment plant being
built by South Koreans at Nar Kangan, and at a nuclear power plant
at Bushehr.
   Early in the war Iraq lost its 140,000 barrel-a-day oil refinery
at Basra. Basra port was closed and two-thirds of the 1 million
inhabitants of the city fled shelling attacks from Iran which
damaged most of the buildings.
   Missiles and bombs did extensive damage to civilian facilities
in other major cities on both sides, including Tehran and Baghdad.

   In the two years since she married the queen's
second son Andrew, the Duchess of York has brought both sparkle and
new controversy to the royal scene.
   Some critics find her vivacious personality and sense of fun
tiresome or vulgar, her adventurous spirit verging on the reckless.
   But royal watchers say the 28-year-old former Sarah Ferguson is
a favorite with Queen Elizabeth II.
   Prince Andrew, a tall, handsome Royal Navy lieutenant, gained a
playboy reputation during a colorful bachelorhood. It included a
well-publicized romance with an American actress, Koo Stark, who
once appeared in soft-porn movies.
   But by the spring of 1986 Andrew was clearly smitten with the
red-haired Miss Ferguson. The public were enjoying her lively good
nature and the queen was reported to be greatly relieved that
Andrew had found a suitable wife.
   They married at Westminster Abbey July 23, 1986, and became the
Duke and Duchess of York. Both were 26.
   Sarah Ferguson was a new kind of royal bride.
   A sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company when
she married, she had led a free and independent life that included
a three-year romance with motor-racing figure Paddy McNally, a
widower with two sons.
   Robust, athletic and outspoken, Sarah was far from the slim,
demure and impeccably-groomed English rose that Princess Diana,
wife of Prince Charles, typified.
   She kept working after her marriage, and although she had given
up her publishing job by early 1988, she planned to do free-lance
work.
   While Andrew pursued his career as a Royal Navy pilot, his wife
learned to fly a helicopter and a plane so she could share the
experience with him.
   The Yorks have rejected the traditional choice of an old stately
home and are building a new house near Windsor Castle _ in a
neo-Tudor style that has drawn some criticism.
   Sarah's attempts to find a fashion sense of her own led to some
howling failures, each of which was dissected in the press.
   The media also criticized what they saw as the duchess' brash
and vulgar behavior during the couple's March U.S. tour,
particularly in Los Angeles.
   Newspapers were especially critical of the duchess' quip: ``I'll
see you later,'' to a man who yelled out, ``I love you'' at a
dinner.
   When Sarah wore a flamboyant black-and-red gown to a black-tie
dinner, Craig Brown of The Sunday Times wrote: ``While the stars of
Hollywood dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows, down
the stairs walloped someone who looked as if she'd just won third
prize for her Carmen Miranda impersonation ... at some forgotten
resort.''
   ``Has the Duchess of York gone too far?'' asked the Observer
newspaper.
   As Sarah grew heavily pregnant, the tabloids carried
unflattering photos of her and made remarks about her weight.
   But the duchess's sense of humor scarcely flagged _ except in
May when a newspaper carried a photo of her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, emerging from a London massage parlor.
   While some newspapers called him Romeo Ronnie and suggested he
be fired from his job as polo manager to Prince Charles, the heir
to the throne, and others said the duchess was advised to avoid him
in public, Sarah was photographed speaking to her father, worriedly.
   The major had become a close friend of the queen's husband,
Prince Philip, through their shared interest in polo. Sarah, born
Oct. 15, 1959, has known all the queen's children since childhood.
   She became a close friend of Diana, who is reported to have done
some matchmaking in Sarah's relationship with Andrew.
   Sarah grew up at her family's 18th-century farmhouse set in
1,200 acres of rolling Hampshire countryside at Dummer. She was
educated at two local boarding schools, Daneshill and Hurst Lodge,
where she was head girl _ the school leader _ excelling at sports
rather than studies.
   Sarah's parents divorced when she was 14, and her mother, Susan,
married Argentine polo professional Hector Barrantes. They live at
Trenque Laughen near Buenos Aires and travel the international polo
circuit.
   After school, Sarah studied at St. James' secretarial college in
London. Then it was off to work, first at an apartment rental
agency, then at a Covent Garden art gallery, a sports public
relations agency and finally as a sales executive with B.C.K.
Graphic Arts in fashionable Mayfair.

   Insider trading on stolen Business Week stock
tip columns has alarmed the magazine's rivals, compelling some to
review their own security and recheck back issues to make sure they
haven't been victimized, too.
   ``We don't take any pleasure in what happened to Business Week,
but we're in the enviable position of bolting the barn door before
the horse escapes, or at least checking the locks,'' said Gary
Belis, spokesman for Fortune, which has a biweekly circulation of
755,000. ``We're checking the locks.''
   Belis said a spot check of Fortune's ``Companies to Watch''
column going back several months showed no unusual prepublication
activity in any stocks mentioned.
   Senior editorial officials at Forbes and Money, two other widely
read business magazines, also said they were reassessing protection
of market-sensitive material in the aftermath of the scandal at
Business Week.
   In addition, the printing companies used by all four magazines
said they were scrutinizing security and reminding all employees
that unpublished material is sacrosanct and not to leave the plant.
   The scandal surfaced July 21 when Business Week, the nation's
largest business weekly with a circulation of nearly 1 million,
disclosed evidence of possibly illegal trading on stocks featured
in its ``Inside Wall Street'' column before it was available to the
public.
   A major investigation has since revealed workers in two plants
run by Business Week printer R.R. Donnelley & Co. took copies the
day before they were released to the public and peddled them to
brokers, sometimes for as little as $20 each.
   As of the weekend, four Donnelley printers and three stock
brokers, one each from Merrill Lynch & Co., Prudential-Bache
Securities Co. and Advest Inc., had lost their jobs. Trades in
several more brokerages are under investigation for possible links
to prepublished ``Inside Wall Street'' tips.
   Unlike newspapers, where the time gap between writing and
printing sensitive material is brief, weeklies and monthlies face
the problem of protecting potentially market-moving items over a
period of days and weeks.
   The problem is compounded in mass-circulation magazines, which
rely on printing plants at several locations and the honesty of
hundreds of printers, couriers, truckers and postal workers who
have access before subscribers do.
   ``There's a real limitation on our ability to place guards on
every truck,'' said Landon Y. Jones, managing editor of Money, a
monthly with a circulation of 1.8 million.
   Jones said Money sent a letter to its printer, World Color Press
in Effingham, Ill., after the Business Week scandal surfaced,
warning that ``the material they handle is property of Money
magazine. It is their obligation to protect Money's property as it
passes through their hands.''
   He said a check of Money's ``Wall Street'' column and other
potentially sensitive material going back at least one year found
no suspicious trading.
   At Forbes, also printed by World Color Press, deputy managing
editor Lawrence Minard said the 740,000-circulation weekly and its
printer historically have had a firm understanding about
confidentiality.
   Nevertheless, Minard said, ``we did reiterate to World Color
that we expect the agreement we've had with them to be vigilantly
observed.''
   Minard said there was no effort at Forbes to recheck back
issues, but he said, ``I suppose on a continuing basis, I very
unofficially monitor it.''
   For their part, Donnelley, World Color and Brown Printing Co. of
Wauseca, Minn., which prints Fortune, have undertaken security
crackdowns.
   Besides dismissing employees implicated in the Business Week
scandal, Chicago-based Donnelley has reminded all workers of a ban
on removing any material from plants. Others have done likewise.
   Donnelley also has uniformed sentries at exits, plainclothes
guards patrolling production lines and a policy that workers'
clothing may be searched. Nevertheless, spokesman James Ratcliffe
said, the company still must largely rely on employee's integrity.
   ``To frisk 650 people would be a bit impractical,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON WIRE: Getting Five Armies To Stop Shooting No Small
Task</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   For the past 13 years, three national armies
and two guerrilla insurgencies have been fighting in southwestern
Africa. Now, finally, there is hope that an end to the conflict may
be within reach.
   The latest step in the process occurred Monday when South
African Foreign Minister Roelof Botha said a ``de facto cessation
of hostilities'' is now in effect in Angola, the scene of direct or
indirect military involvement by the Soviet Union, the United
States, Cuba and South Africa.
   The imponderables in the region are many and just keeping track
of all the players is no small achievement.
   The Cubans have been in Angola since that country's independence
from Portuguese rule in 1975. South Africans have fought
intermittently in Angola, worried about Marxist penetration in an
area close to home. The Angolan Army, of course, has been a major
player, arrayed against both the South Africans and a U.S.-backed
rebel group. Finally, in Namibia, a black nationalist liberation
movement has been fighting South African colonial control.
   The trick for U.S. diplomats, led by Assistant Secretary of
State Chester Crocker, is to devise a formula that would induce
each of the five to lay down its arms.
   For years, progress was negligible but things began to change
when Crocker, serving as peace mediator, succeeded in convening a
meeting of South African, Cuban and Angolan authorities in London
last May.
   At that meeting and in three subsequent sessions, the outlines
of a settlement have come into view.
   Following is a brief summary of the interests of each party:
   South Africa _ It has said for years that it would be willing to
allow independence and black majority rule in Namibia so long as
the estimated 50,000 Cubans leave Angola in a reasonable time.
Continued colonial control of Namibia has been expensive for South
Africa and the departure of the Cubans would ease its security
concerns about Angola.
   Cuba _ Its initial reason for becoming involved in Angola was to
protect a Marxist ally against South African military encroachment.
If the South Africans promise to leave, that would remove the
excuse for which the Cubans were sent to Angola in the first place.
Cuba could withdraw its troops with its head held high, claiming
that Angola was now safe from South African aggression.
   Angola _ It has been devastated by years of warfare. A Cuban
withdrawal could make the government more vulnerable to attacks by
the anti-communist guerrilla movement. On the other hand, the UNITA
rebels under the package deal now being negotiated would no longer
receive assistance from South Africa, whose forces would be
withdrawn to within the country's national boundaries.
   SWAPO _ Known formally as the South-West Africa People's
Organization, SWAPO is the Namibian rebel group that has been
fighting South African colonial rule for more than 20 years. Once
South Africa consents to elections for an independent government,
SWAPO can finally lay down its arms and reintegrate into Namibian
society.
   The Soviet Union _ It has poured hundreds of millions of dollars
into Angola in support of its ally over the years. Moscow has been
showing increasing eagerness in promoting a settlement, apparently
intent on cutting costs in an area of minimal strategic concern.
   The United States _ Its main interest is eliminating the Cuban
military presence in Africa. Cuba's inclination to send large
expeditionary forces to distant lands has long been a sore point in
Washington. For the past three years, the Reagan administration has
been sending military aid to the UNITA rebels in Angola.
   UNITA's fate is not under discussion in the U.S.-mediated talks,
which are focused exclusively on external involvement in the
region. The United States has been prodding the Angolan government
to open national reconciliation talks with UNITA.
   A key hurdle will come later this month when the parties attempt
to reach agreement on a timetable for Cuban withdrawal from Angola.
Diplomats have never been more optimistic but Botha is advising
caution, insisting that the cease fire is ``the first step of a
very long, arduous road'' to peace.

   After a thousand years of Arab-Persian
hostility and eight of war, peace is a precious but chimeric
commodity for Iran and Iraq.
   Yet after a year-long U.N. peace effort and two weeks of
delicate, for a time deadlocked negotiations, a truce _ if not a
lasting peace _ is at hand.
   On Monday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced
that the guns would fall silent on Aug. 20 and both sides would
meet five days later in Geneva for face-to-face peace talks under
U.N. auspices.
   ``I am persuaded that both nations deeply wanted peace and are
committed to it,'' he said. And that opened the way.
   It also opens the way for improved relations between the United
States and Iran, a reduced U.S. naval presence in the Persian Gulf
and a better atmosphere in which to seek release of foreign
hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fundamentalists in
Lebanon.
   The occasion marks the first time in memory that a U.N.
resolution has been a key to ending a conflict. Numerous
resolutions pertaining to the Middle East and southern Africa have
gone unheeded.
   Resolution 598 _ the year-old Persian Gulf peace plan _ is
coming to fruition.
   The cease-fire announcement was the second major victory for
Perez de Cuellar since April, when Pakistan and Afghanistan signed
a U.N.-mediated pact providing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan.
   As in the case of Afghanistan, a U.N. plan and mechanism already
was in place when the belligerents turned to New York.
   Monday's proclamation also signifies a revival of the
financially ailing United Nations after years of lying fallow and
ineffective. Among other tasks, it is now expected to play a
peacekeeping role in southern Africa and Cambodia.
   For Iran and Iraq, the cease-fire announcement is only the
beginning of a long, problematic road. Both belligerents gave way
at the bargaining table because of economic and political
compulsions; their weariness of war, not their dedication to peace.
   Both now claim political victory and say the other side gave way.
   The two shattered nations have nothing to show for the conflict
that has claimed up to 1 million lives. The battle lines today are
much as they were in September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran after a
series of border skirmishes.
   If anything, the bitterness is greater, and Iraq's massive and
frequent use of internationally abhorred and outlawed poison gas
has increased the enmity.
   The cease-fire announcement is the culmination of U.N. peace
efforts that began on July 20, 1987, when the Security Council
adopted Resolution 598, demanding an immediate cease-fire and
setting out a peace plan.
   For a full year, Perez de Cuellar negotiated with both sides.
   Last year, Iraq was losing the war and immediately accepted
Resolution 598, which calls for a troop withdrawal, prisoner
exchange, establishment of a tribunal to assess responsibility for
the damage, formal peace talks and reconstruction.
   Iran, which was winning, held out. It demanded that as a
precondition for peace, Iraq must be branded the aggressor.
   For a full year, Iran was branded the obstructor of peace for
not embracing the resolution.
   Now, a year later, the tables are turned.
   After a series of battlefield setbacks, Iran abruptly announced
on July 18 that it was embracing Resolution 598 and urged an
immediate cease-fire.
   Tehran dropped the precondition of branding Iraq the aggressor.
   Iran's supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, said
that making the choice for peace was ``worse than swallowing
poison.''
   The secretary-general declared he would send a cease-fire
mission to both countries and summoned the foreign ministers of
both nations for peace talks.
   But Iraq, which was on the offensive, suddenly demanded direct
talks with Iran as a precondition of a cease-fire.
   Iran said direct talks could be held only after a cease-fire,
troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and his Iraqi
counterpart, Tariq Aziz, came to New York, but U.N.-mediated
negotiations deadlocked over the issue of direct talks.
   Iran appeared to be the peacemaker, while Iraq held back.
   Perez de Cuellar then devised a formula under which a truce
would be followed rapidly by direct talks on a comprehensive peace.
Iran agreed immediately.
   On Saturday, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq said he would go
along with direct talks after a cease-fire, dropping his objections.
   That was the breakthrough.
   ``The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both
countries victories far greater than those of war,'' Perez de
Cuellar said Monday.

   Astronomers searching for radio signals from
intelligent life beyond the Earth say circumstantial evidence is
growing that humankind is not alone in the universe.
   Reports of the discovery of new planets and of the presence of
complex organic chemicals on comets are ``encouraging'' Michael J.
Klein, manager of NASA's radio search for life, said Monday.
   Research announced at the International Astronomical Union's
20th assembly last week showed the discovery of at least 10
planet-like objects in orbit of distant stars. Other studies showed
that comets and cosmic dust particles contain the complex organic
compounds that are thought to have been the chemical precursors of
life.
   ``That is the circumstantial evidence that life exists
elsewhere,'' Klein said. ``We know now that the materials are
there. It gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track.''
   Klein heads a project called the Search for Extraterrestial
Intelligence, or SETI, that is planning to mount an intensified
search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on
planets orbiting distant stars.
   Programs run by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, Harvard University and others have listened for
intelligence-directed radio signals for more than 20 years, but
only a small fraction of the vast universe and the many radio
frequencies that must be monitored actually have been checked.
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated by the
California Institute of Technology for NASA, has proposed expanding
the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to
tens of millions of channels at the same time. The equipment would
be monitoried by a computer capable of identifying signals that
could be sent by intelligent life.
   Klein said the new equipment would be able to look at 1,000
different stars that are thought to be similar to the Earth's sun,
locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the
evolution of life.
   There also would be ``whole sky survey'' in many radio
frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be searched
systematically.
   Searches in the past ``have only scratched the surface,'' said
Klein.
   The new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than
present equipment, he said, noting, ``In the first few minutes, we
would be able to match all of the searches that were done before.''
   But even with the new devices, the job is immense, said Frank
Drake, chairman of a SETI committee of the astronomical union and
an astronomer at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
   ``Many people think the project should succeed in the next year
or two,'' he said. ``That's probably not going to happen. The
universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large, it will take
us decades.''
   But Drake added: ``The consequences of success are so great that
it's worth dealing with the problems.''
   The theory behind the SETI work is that because there are
billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, the odds are
good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on Earth
also exist elsewhere.
   If so, then intelligent life could have developed along the same
lines as it did here on Earth. Civilizations that are equal to or
more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals, just as
occurs on Earth. The SETI project is looking for those signals.
   Such signals may ``leak out'' just as they do on Earth, Drake
said.
   ``The strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the
accumulation of our television signals,'' he said. The second most
common radio signal from Earth comes from military communications.
   Klein said the federal budget now under consideration by
Congress includes a $6 million appropriation for the enhanced SETI
equipment. He said the total project would last 10 years and cost
$90 million.
   If the funding were approved, the intensified search could begin
in 1992, with all of the new equipment operating by 1994.

   She's only fifth in line to the throne, but from
the hospital crowds to the headlines, the birth of Britain's newest
princess has shown the royal family working a magic that defies
even the experts.
   ``I can't think why there's such hysterical interest really,''
said Charles Kidd, editor of Debrett's Peerage, which chronicles
Britain's blue bloods.
   ``But it just keeps increasing ... Maybe it's because there's
been a leveling out of social classes _ which is very good, but at
the same time does make for rather boring reading,'' Kidd said in
an interview.
   ``And these characters are supposed to be a bit bigger than
life, or we're led to believe they are,'' he added.
   And so they seemed Tuesday.
   Almost all of Britain's dozen national newspapers splashed
across their front pages the Monday night birth of the Princess of
York to Queen Elizabeth's second son, Andrew, and his wife, Sarah.
   Radio and television networks led bulletins repeatedly with the
news, edging out the cease-fire agreement in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Only the Communist Morning Star and the newest upscale
newspaper, the 375,000-circulation Independent, ignored or paid
little attention to the birth of the queen's fifth grandchild.
   ``We are not much interested in minor royals, but we did record
the event,'' said John Price, news editor of the Independent, which
gave the story three lines on page 2. ``The Independent's view is
that these people don't matter.''
   It was a lonely view.
   Compared with the attention given to Europe's other major
surviving monarchies _ the Spanish, the Scandinavians, the Dutch
and the Belgians _ Britain erupted with royal fever.
   The monarchs of Sweden, Denmark and Norway attract plenty of
attention among their Scandinavian subjects, but not much elsewhere.
   In the Netherlands, by the time former Queen Juliana's youngest
grandchild, also Juliana, was born in October 1981, interest in
royal babies had cooled. The little Juliana was the ex-queen's 13th
grandchild.
   In Sweden, the birth in 1982 of a third child, Princess
Madeleine, to King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia, dominated the
local news but did not make world headlines.
   Royal babies not in direct line to the throne receive scant
attention. Only one newspaper in Norway mentioned the birth in
Brazil last month of Norwegian King Olav's second great-grandchild.
   In Belgium, pictures of King Baudouin and Queen Fabiola seldom
appear in then news. The heir to the throne, Baudouin's nephew,
Prince Albert, keeps even further out of the limelight.
   In contrast, the royal family of the tiny principality of Monaco
has the photographers in hot pursuit, particularly Princess
Caroline and Princess Stephanie, daughters of Prince Rainier and
the late Grace Kelly.
   But even for them, the scrutiny palls compared to the life of
the British monarch's children and their offspring.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage,
attributes the publicity given Andrew's wife, Sarah, partly to what
he says has become an international hobby _ British royal-watching
_ and partly to her unusual background for a royal bride.
   The former Sarah Ferguson had no title, was a commoner, had two
serious romances before Andrew, and pursued her career in a graphic
arts company.
   He believes that historians will credit the former Miss Ferguson
with ``taking the royal family into the 21st century.''
   ``From the literally thousands of letters we get _ from
Americans, Germans, Japanese _ wanting information about the royal
family, it's clear that royal-watching has become as much a hobby
as stamp-collecting,'' said Brooks-Baker.
   The birth of the Princess of York received more publicity in
Britain than did the birth in 1947 of Prince Charles, heir to the
throne, he said.
   ``This interest in things royal is a great snowball ...
interesting and also terrifying,'' said Brooks-Baker.
   ``As this soap opera becomes more and more universal, one
wonders where it is going to end and whether it will crush the very
people it is portraying. I don't know.''

   Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut sat alone
as he delivered an impassioned plea to a Republican Platform panel,
urging his GOP brethren to stand firm against apartheid in South
Africa.
   ``The regime in South Africa is no better than the regime in
Nazi Germany in the '30s,'' he said. ``That regime tried to do to
the Jewish people what South Africa is doing to the blacks.''
   Weicker, playing a role he perfected in 1984, is practically the
sole dissenter in this week's platform deliberations.
   After Weicker's testimony, conservative activist Donald Devine
said, ``It looks like Mr. Weicker is doing his usual thing: going
around making a lot of noise and not getting any votes.''
   Alone among prominent Republicans, Weicker has taken it upon
himself to push for some moderate-to-liberal platform planks,
positions that are almost certain not to emerge from the draft for
next week's GOP platform.
   Weicker also has prepared platform proposals calling for support
of the Equal Rights Amendment and an activist approach toward the
AIDS crisis. He said he plans to press for adoption of the planks
in drafting sessions later this week.
   Weicker is generally unpopular among the conservative activists
who dominate the Republican platform process, and when his
testimony ended, several subcommittee members unburdened themselves
of several polite but insistent questions about his anti-apartheid
stand.
   ``What about your call for support for front-line states of
southern Africa, including Marxist-run Angola?''
   ``What further economic sanctions ... you said, an oil embargo,
if necessary?''
   While Weicker was tilting at windmills, witnesses who gave
presentations for the Strategic Defense Initiative, a continuation
of Reagan administration economic policy and support for the
Nicaraguan rebels received general and positive queries that
enabled them to score easy points.
   Fred Ikle, former undersecretary of defense, testified that the
United States should maintain a steady growth in the defense
budget, continue its support for anti-communist rebels and work
toward the deployment of SDI, the missile defense system known as
Star Wars.
   The question to Ikle: ``What would have happened if the country
had adopted Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis' views seven years
ago?''
   Answer: ``We'd be in a period of crisis, rolling out the red
carpet for Soviet expansion ... and have no Intermediate-range
Nuclear Forces Treaty.''
   Daniel Graham, the former head of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, testified that President Reagan's Star Wars plan is a
``strategic master stroke,'' comparable to the ``Louisiana
Purchase, the Monroe Doctrine and the Apollo space program.''
   Graham's comments brought smiles to the faces of the
subcommittee members. There were no questions.
   Weicker drew a few murmurs in the audience when he first
compared South Africa to Nazi Germany, citing the government's
policy of strict racial segregation of blacks.
   When a panelist sought help to understand that view, Weicker
said:
   ``South Africa has done by law exactly what Nazi Germany did by
law,'' he responded.
   His anti-apartheid plank would say: ``As the historical party of
individual rights, the Republican Party rejects apartheid and seeks
its abolition. We believe the United States has a moral
responsibility to impose, in concert with other nations, further
economic sanctions _ including an oil embargo, if necessary _ to
bring this heinous practice to an end.''
   Weicker agreed with his questioners that an oil embargo and
other economic sanctions probably would hurt the United States
financially, but pleaded with the panel's sense of humanity.
   If that didn't work, there was Weicker's argument that the
United States needed a stronger presence on the African continent,
especially in the face of Marxist-led countries such as Angola.
   And if that failed, there was always the comparison with the
Democrats, who in their platform labeled South Africa a terrorist
state.
   ``It shouldn't be a Democratic issue,'' Weicker said, noting
that a Republican-controlled Congress passed the initial economic
sanctions against South Africa and a GOP Congress overrode Reagan's
veto.
   And as he stood up, ready to leave the conference room, Weicker
_ brandishing his Republicanism _ said defiantly, ``I'm not taking
a back seat to the Democrats on any issue ... especially when they
have a mealy-mouth platform.''

<HEAD>President Prods Congress To Move Faster On Welfare Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says Congress has not moved
quickly enough on welfare reform and urban renewal, and he told the
nation's governors they've been ``way out front'' on many social
issues.
   Reagan, a former two-term governor of California, used a speech
to the governors Monday to tout his ``New Federalism'' policy of
shifting more responsibility for social programs away from the
federal government and onto the states.
   Many governors, especially Democrats, have complained that the
states cannot absorb increasing cuts in federal aid while
maintaining services for their citizens. During his speech at the
National Governors Association's meeting in Cincinnati, Reagan
described his effort as one giving states a ``leadership role.''
   ``We have broken the federal government of its compulsion to
control every breath the states take,'' he said.
   Reagan, facing a host of last-minute issues on Capitol Hill as
lawmakers draw near a recess for the Republican National
Convention, was playing host to Republican congressional leaders at
the White House today.
   In his Cincinnati speech, Reagan complained that Congress has
not acted on legislation he submitted six years ago, proposing that
the most depressed areas of America's cities receive tax breaks to
encourage business investment.
   ``Despite some minor moves last year, Congress still has failed
to pass meaningful enterprise zone legislation,'' he said. ``Not
you. Over half the states have gone forward with their own
enterprise zones.''
   Reagan also said the states have moved more quickly to get
people off welfare rolls.
   ``Welfare reform is another field in which you have been way out
front,'' he said. ``Congress today is still debating a welfare
reform package _ years after states started taking advantage of the
greater flexibility we gave them.''
   Reagan said the federal government should not ``merely let the
states toss ideas into a suggestion box,'' but that it should
``honor the leadership role the states have to play.''
   Reagan won compliments from Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New
Jersey, who said the president ``was talking language we
understand.''
   But Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas said Reagan gave a
political speech designed mainly to help Vice President George Bush
in the presidential election.
   The governor's association has said it wants its meeting to be
non-partisan. Clinton said, ``I think it was as political as he
could be without stepping out of line.''
   Earlier, Reagan toured a U.S. Precision Lens Inc. plant, telling
managers and employees he resents talk about the ``Rust Belt'' in
the nation's Midwest.
   ``I get a little tired of hearing Cincinnati and other
Midwestern cities called the `Rust Belt' when the Midwest isn't the
`Rust Belt.' It's the `Boom Belt.'''

<HEAD>Danish Film Rouses Friends of Turtle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friends of the endangered sea turtle are upset
because a prize-winning Danish film, ``Babette's Feast,'' has
turtle soup on the menu.
   They are investigating a report from a Florida restaurant that
it got some sea turtle meat from San Francisco for use in a dinner
to promote the film.
   ``There's a gelatinous substance called calipee under the shell
of the sea turtle that's the basis for turtle soup,'' explained
Marydele Donnelly, director of the Sea Turtle Rescue Fund, in a
telephone interview Monday.
   ``Actually, the turtle you see beating its flippers in the film
seems to be a loggerhead, which is a different species that doesn't
have the calipee,'' she said. ``But both are on the endangered
species list and its illegal to catch them in this country.''
   The film is based on a short story by Danish writer Isak
Dinesen, pen name of the late Baroness Karen Blixen-Finecke, who
also wrote ``Out of Africa.''
   ``Babette's Feast'' tells of a Frenchwoman living on the coast
of Denmark who spends her lottery winnings on a big dinner for the
villagers who have befriended her in her long exile. The Motion
Picture Academy awarded it an Oscar as the best foreign film of the
year.
   Lawrence Lane-Zucker, who is helping promote the film for Orion
Classics, said its food consultant has worked up substitute recipes
using shitake mushrooms and chopped breast of duck. About 90
restaurants have been interested in reproducing the seven-course
meal, he said.
   Ms. Donnelly said some restaurants are using diamondback
terrapin, which is not a sea turtle but is found in estuaries and
considered endangered in some places. Ms. Donnelly says 10,000
terrapin a year are sold in New York fish markets and the New York
Turtle and Tortoise Society is trying to get it put on the state's
endangered list.
   Groceries sell a ``mock turtle soup,'' which she says is made
from land turtles. They are not on anyone's endangered list, but
she would prefer nobody ate turtle soup at all.
   ``Turtles in the Soup: Recipe for Disaster'' is the title of an
article written by Ms. Donnelly for the August issue of ``CEE
Report,'' published by the Center for Environmental Education.
   Meanwhile, sea turtles weren't faring well in Congress on
Monday, where the House approved legislation to bar the Reagan
administration temporarily from carrying out a plan to require
shrimp fishermen to use devices to protect the reptiles.
   Turtles often drown when snared in shrimp nets.
   The bill, sent to the Senate by voice vote, would prohibit the
mandatory use of so-called turtle excluder devices before Sept. 30,
a month after excluder-device regulations were slated to take
effect.
   The delay would give House and Senate negotiators time to work
out differences in their versions of legislation to reauthorize the
Endangered Species Act.
   Both bills would prohibit the required use of excluder devices
in inshore waters until May 1990. The Senate bill also would ban
device regulations for offshore waters until next May.

<HEAD>Some Bribery Reported Helping Third World</HEAD>
<HEAD>By CARL HARTMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some bribes can help Third World countries get
ahead and can make a ``positive contribution to society,'' a
politics professor writes in a magazine published by an affiliate
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   David Osterfeld, who teaches politics at Saint Joseph's College
in Rensselaer, Ind., argues that it is useful to a country if a
government charges $1,000 for a license to enter an occupation but
an official issues one for a bribe of $900.
   ``The reduced cost facilitates entry into the field, thereby
introducing an element of competition into an otherwise
monopolistic situation,'' he says in an article called ``Corruption
and Development.''
   Osterfeld's article appears in the current issue of the
quarterly ``Journal of Economic Growth,'' published by the National
Chamber Foundation. The foundation is a research affiliate of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a private business organization.
   The trade bill now awaiting President Reagan's signature will
ease the effect of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and make it
easier for executives here to defend themselves when their agents
are charged with paying bribes abroad.
   Osterfeld doesn't defend all bribes, saying that some are
``wicked.''
   ``For instance, the alleged involvement of Panama`s (military
ruler Gen. Manuel) Noriega in the drug trade is a case of
corruption in all of its wickedness, where society is clearly
hurt,'' he says.
   ``However, a Peruvian street vendor's bribing of a low-level
government official in order to obtain a license to sell his wares,
while also a corrupt act, makes a positive contribution to
society,'' he wrote.
   Osterfeld says that even if the bribe is several times the size
of the license fee _ as an Indian investigating committee found was
often the case _ the bribe is still useful.
   ``(It) not only benefits the bureaucrat, but, more importantly,
insures that the licenses are allocated efficiently, since those
able to offer the highest bribes are the most productive and
efficient firms,'' he adds.
   There was disagreement from Lilia Ferro-Clerico, a Uruguayan who
coordinates Caribbean and Central American studies for Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.
   ``That's pretty far-fetched,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   ``I don't think corruption is ever helpful. You have a parallel
here in the Pentagon scandal _ all the bribes did was to make it
more expensive for the taxpayer.''
   Osterfeld defends what he calls ``expansive corruption,'' which
he says increases chances for trade that benefits a country.
   ``It entails increased competition and market flexibility,'' he
says.
   ``The result is that the quantity of goods produced expands and
their quality improves. It is, in short, characterized by the
expansion of the overall wealth of society.
   ``(It) is morally defensible since its goal is to defend one's
own property as well as one's right to engage in voluntary
activities.''
   As examples of ``expansive corruption'' he suggests:
   _Evading price controls or tariffs by bribes to officials to
permit smuggling or black marketing.
   _Bribes to evade licensing restrictions or controls on
immigration and emigration.
   Bribing a judge in cases of smuggling, occupational licenses,
black marketing and price controls are called ``defensive bribing''
and Osterfeld classifies that as expansive as well.
   ``Even if society becomes demoralized or disillusioned by such
corruption, the effects may not be an impediment to development
...,'' he adds.
   He explains that the cynicism may lead to increased self-seeking
that furthers development.
   Osterfeld concludes that ``expansive corruption'' is a response
to government restrictions on economic freedom. Those concerned
about it, who want economic development, should concentrate on
reducing government action that tempts corruption, he says.

   Baseball after dark dawned Monday at Wrigley
Field, the last major-league ballpark with day-only games, but rain
put out the lights early.
   The first night game in the 74-year history of Wrigley Field,
between the Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies, was delayed by a
downpour in the bottom of the fourth inning. It was officially
postponed two hours, 15 minutes later, wiping out the Cubs' 3-1
lead, since the game will have to be replayed.
   Philadelphia's Phil Bradley led off by hitting a home run into
the left-center field seats of Wrigley Field, which for 40 years
had been the sole major league ballpark to hold out against lights.
Chicago fans' mood brightened, however, after the home team came
back with a first inning homer by Ryne Sandberg.
   The Cubs, mired in fourth place in the National League East
Division, scored two more runs before thundershowers forced a delay.
   ``God is talking,'' said 26-year-old Jim Herrmann, who had just
fled the stadium. ``He doesn't want night games at Wrigley Field.''
   Authorities reported at least five arrests through the rain
delay, including three for ticket scapling and two vendor
violations, but few other problems, except for illegally parked
cars.
   Mayor Eugene Sawyer toured the surrounding Wrigleyville
neighborhood before entering the park and predicted that residents,
some of whom equate Cubs baseball with daylight, would get used to
night games.
   ``I think as we advance the whole plan and get people used to
night games I'm optimistic it will eventually smooth out,'' Sawyer
said.
   ``It's a historical moment, but it disturbs me because I don't
want people to use my gangway as a bathroom or throw bottles in my
alley,'' said Carmelo Flores, 32, a Wrigley Field neighbor painting
his fence Monday afternoon.
   ``We live here and the people in this neighborhood take care of
it. But some fans just don't respect the community,'' he said.
   Even President Reagan was struck by the history of the moment.
   Reagan, boarding Air Force One in Cincinnati on Monday, was
asked what he thought of the first night baseball game at Wrigley
Field.
   ``I'm too old-fashioned,'' said Reagan, who early in his radio
career did re-enactments of Cubs' games for stations in Iowa.
   ``There's nothing like daytime baseball. But I understand the
need for lights _ box office.''
   Chicago police scheduled 172 officers, including mounted police
and canine units, and revved up 15 tow trucks for illegally parked
cars. The normal phalanx for day games is about 50 police, said
Officer William Kernan.
   Permit parking is available only for residents of the
neighborhood of turn-of-the century, two- and three-flat apartments
that is becoming upscale from its working-class roots.
   Outside the park Monday, the excitement began early. Throngs of
fans _ some of whom had been there since 8 p.m. Sunday for the best
of the general admission bleacher seats _ lined the streets, while
T-shirt vendors hawked homemade wares. Some of the parking lot
operators near the park put up new prices, $15 in one case.
   Ivy-covered Wrigley Field held on to daytime-only baseball
decades longer than any other ballpark in the nation, joining the
fraternity of the illumined 40 years after the last team to light
up _ the Detroit Tigers.
   The Chicago City Council voted in February to lift the ban on
lights, and lights are scheduled to burn brightly in the North Side
stadium seven times this season and 18 times next season.
   The $5 million lighting system has already added a modern flare
to the blue and white Wrigley Field, which was built in 1914 to
house the Chicago Whales of the short-lived Federal League.
   There were more than a few attempts to pull the plug on lights
even before 91-year-old Cubs fan Harry Grossman could throw a
ceremonial switch to illuminate the field for the first time.
   The Tribune Co., announced soon after it bought the Chicago Cubs
in 1981 that it intended to put lights in the ballpark, saying
day-only baseball cost the company revenue from televised night
games.
   But Wrigleyville residents took on the media company and managed
to keep the ban on lights alive for almost seven years.
   Citizens United for Baseball in the Sunshine _ CUBS _
spearheaded efforts that included lobbying city and state
officials. The group decried problems with rowdy crowds, traffic
and parking it said would accompany night games.
   CUBS planned to monitor the neighborhood Monday for material to
use in a planned court action to limit night games, said Mike
Quigley, the group's vice president. Quigley refused to give
details of the court battle, but said it would begin Wednesday.
   The end of an era also brought out the entrepreneur in some
neighbors.
   ``My mom rented out our roof to some suburban rich people,''
Junior Cruz, 19, said Monday afternoon at his home across from the
ballpark. ``She's even got a gate around the top so if they get
drunk they won't fall off the side.''

<HEAD>Senate Approves Legislation To Streamline Licensing for New
Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. nuclear power industry _ its image
tarnished by events such as Three Mile Island which led to a
decade-long dearth of construction of new nuclear plants _ is
mounting a comeback in the waning weeks of the 100th Congress.
   First, the House and Senate have sent President Reagan
legislation that would continue the industry's protection _ unique
in federal law _ against being required to pay unlimited amounts of
money to victims of a reactor accident.
   And on Monday, the Senate approved legislation long sought by
the nuclear industry to streamline the licensing process for new
nuclear plants and to attempt to revitalize the moribund U.S.
uranium industry.
   Industry spokesman have said that a new licensing process, along
with a standardized plant design they hope the process will
produce, will break the drought that has seen no new nuclear plant
construction in this decade.
   The licensing and uranium provisions were added on the Senate
floor to legislation that would convert the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission from a five-member panel to a Nuclear Safety Agency
headed by a chief administrator.
   The bill, approved 89-6, also would strengthen NRC procedures
for investigating nuclear plant accidents and wrongdoing by NRC
employees.
   However, none of the several House committees that share
jurisdiction over the legislation has held hearings on all of the
Senate bill's many elements. It was considered unlikely that the
complex legislation would clear Congress in the five weeks
remaining on the schedule for the 1988 session.
   The liability bill sent to Reagan, a 15-year renewal of the 1957
Price-Anderson Act, would set $7.1 billion as the maximum amount
the owners of nuclear generators would have to pay in damages
arising from a single accident.
   That amount is 10 times the previous liability cap. It is about
triple what the industry was lobbying for. But it could have been
far worse from the industry's standpoint.
   Some government reports have estimated that a major nuclear
accident could cause $100 billion in damages. Environmental groups
and the Ralph Nader organization had been pushing for unlimited
liability for the industry.
   Officials of the Office of Management and Budget say it is
likely that Reagan will sign the Price-Anderson reauthorization,
which leaves it to Congress to decide how to find the money needed
to pay more than $7.1 billion in damages.
   Barring an accident requiring large payments to victims, the
higher liability limit is not expected to have any major impact on
electricity rates charged by utilities with nuclear plants,
according to congressional staffers.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, added the amendment Monday to the
NRC restructuring bill that would scrap the process under which a
new plant must get separate construction and operating licenses
from the agency.
   The industry has blamed much of its problems in getting new
plants built on the NRC's two-step process. It has said that a
single license would spur development of cheaper, standardized
plant designs.
   The uranium industry also won a long-sought provision with a
78-17 vote for an amendment that would force plant operators to pay
a federal fee if they obtain more than 37.5 percent of their
reactor uranium from foreign sources.
   The amendment by Sens. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., also would create government-owned corporation to take over
the U.S. uranium enrichment program and spend $750 million to
acquire up to 30 million pounds of uranium by 1996.
   Their plan also would authorize spending about $1 billion to
clean up uranium tailings _ the waste created by uranium mining

<HEAD>Congress Sends Fair Housing Bill to Reagan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fair housing bill, the first major expansion
of civil rights laws in two decades, is heading to the White House
for the signature of President Reagan, who has endorsed the measure.
   The legislation gives federal officials new power to enforce
fair housing laws and extends anti-discrimination protection to the
disabled and families with children.
   The bill was approved Monday by the House with no debate. Final
congressional passage came in a nearly deserted chamber as a few
House members concurred by voice vote in amendments approved last
week by the Senate.
   The original fair housing law, passed in 1968 after the
assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., gave
the federal government only a mediation role in settling housing
disputes.
   Under the new bill, the secretary of housing and urban
development is empowered to go to court to seek stiff fines against
property owners accused of discrimination.
   Current protections against racial and sexual discrimination are
extended to the handicapped and to families with children under 18.
   In addition, the bill says new residences with at least four
units would have to be accessible to the handicapped.
   The added protection for families with young children
effectively ends ``adults only'' restrictions, except for
exemptions for retirement communities for the elderly.

<HEAD>Panel Drops Plan To Give National Party More Authority Over State
Parties</HEAD>

   Republicans may have to wait until the 1996
election to break the ties that bind their party to following the
wishes of state legislatures controlled by Democrats.
   A GOP panel on Monday dropped a proposal to give the national
party more centralized authority, a notion that makes many
Republicans squeamish because that's how the Democrats operate.
   The decision by the Republican National Committee's Rules
Committee, if left standing by the convention next week, means the
party's current system for picking national convention delegates
will remain in place through the 1992 presidential primaries and
caucuses.
   ``One way or another, we ought to be masters of our own fate,''
said Roger Allan Moore, RNC general counsel who asked for the
withdrawal of his proposal to centralize GOP authority.
   ``I think the Democrats have done a lot of damage to themselves
with their rules,'' said Grace Boulton, a GOP national
committeewoman from Oklahoma who advocated a rival proposal that
would have given state parties the right to overrule state laws
governing party procedures.
   ``I just think to have any kind of national committee or group
approving state party rules is the wrong way to go,'' she said.
   Dropping the two competing proposals was part of a compromise
worked out earlier this summer, Ms. Boulton said.
   Republican rules currently require state parties to adhere to
local laws, such as those establishing and scheduling primaries, in
picking their national convention delegates.
   Moore said the problem with this is ``there are 36 states where
we do not control the legislatures'' and thus Democrats are allowed
to govern what ought to be matters of internal Republican Party
policy.
   The issue arose during the 1988 election, when Southern state
legislatures controlled by Democrats decided to hold their
primaries on one day, which became known as Super Tuesday, March 8.
Some Republican state parties raised objections but were powerless
to do anything more.
   Supreme Court decisions have said that the parties, not the
states, have the final say over their internal operations,
including the selection of delegates to presidential nominating
conventions.
   Moore said that under those decisions, the national parties
clearly have the authority to overrule state law, but it is unclear
whether state parties can exercise the same authority.
   The Supreme Court is considering a case dealing with that very
issue, but Moore said he did not believe the ruling would go in
favor of the state parties.
   Moore said his proposal was not intended to allow the national
party to meddle in state party affairs, but he acknowledged there
was a fear it would put the GOP ``on the slippery slope to where
the Democrats are.''

<HEAD>Author of `Zorba' and `Last Temptation' Remains Popular in Greece</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HERAKLION, Crete (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Nikos Kazantzakis, who created
joy of life with ``Zorba the Greek'' and a religious storm with
``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' remains popular in his native
land 30 years after his death.
   His novels sell thousands of copies every year, mainly in Greek
but also in English, French, German and Japanese. He is believed to
be the most-read writer in modern Greek.
   ``We have a huge turnover in the half-dozen major Kazantzakis
novels. ... In Greek he's mostly bought by young people, and then
the tourists pick up the foreign language copies,'' said Byron
Dokimakis. He owns a leading bookstore in Heraklion, capital of
Crete, the island where Kazantzakis was born.
   Dokimakis said the two most popular novels are ``Zorba,'' an
exuberant portrayal set on Crete of a man with a huge zest for
life, and ``Last Temptation,'' which presents Jesus as a weak,
unstable man who doubts his divinity and dreams of making love to
Mary Magdalene, the reformed sinner.
   Michael Cacoyannis' award-winning 1963 film version of ``Zorba
the Greek,'' starring Anthony Quinn, has become a classic. Martin
Scorsese's ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' to be released
Friday, has provoked protest and outrage by Christian groups in the
United States.
   Such a reaction comes as no surprise in Greece. The Greek
Orthodox Church condemned the book as heretical when it was
published in 1954 and nearly excommunicated Kazantzakis.
   George Moustakis, a Greek theologian, said Kazantzakis escaped
excommunication ``only because the Cretans were so angry they
threatened to burn every church on the island if it went through.''
   ``There's still a puritan streak in American life that's bound
to be offended by the film,'' he added, ``and I'm sure that its
release in Greece will bring protests from the church.''
   The Vatican also blacklisted the novel in 1954. Italian director
Franco Zeffirelli said he would withdraw his ``Young Toscanini''
from the Venice Film Festival later this month if Scorsese's movie
was scheduled to be shown just before or after it.
   Kazantzakis acknowledged strong personal identification with the
tormented character of Christ he portrayed, but said the book was
an affirmation of faith.
   ``I am certain that every free man who reads this book, so
filled as it is with love, will more than ever before ... love
Christ,'' he wrote in the introduction.
   On Crete, the largest Greek island with a population of 550,000,
Kazantzakis is a hero symbolizing its tradition of radicalism and
defiant independence.
   He was born in 1883 into a farm family and studied in Athens and
Paris. As a young man, he spent six months in a Greek Orthodox
monastery on Mount Athos, but later embraced a range of
philosophies that included Marxism, Buddhism and nihilism, the
denial of all meaning in life.
   Kazantzakis turned to novels late in life after completing what
he called his life's work, the 33,000-line philosophical poem ``The
Odyssey: a Modern Sequel.'' He settled in Antibes in southern
France, but always had fistful of earth from Crete in his study.
   When he died in 1957, Kazantzakis was internationally acclaimed
but embittered by his failure to win the Nobel Prize for
literature. He blamed that on the Greek literary establishment.
   ``He was always an outsider who never got along with the other
literary personalities of his day like (George) Seferis,'' a Greek
poet who won the prize, said Katerina Angeliki-Rooke, a poet. Her
family knew Kazantzakis well.
   ``The establishment here still chooses to ignore him,'' she
said. ``There's been no serious intellectual study of his work in
Greece.''
   A Kazantzakis revival started seven years ago when Premier
Andreas Papandreou's new Socialist government made him required
reading in public high schools.
   Rose Kyriakakis, 15, of Heraklion said: ``I love his books, the
way he uses the language, the strange words and the great big
ideas. He's inspirational.''
   The Greek Orthodox Church keeps official silence on Kazantzakis,
but lay religious organizations still describe his work as
blasphemous.
   Many literary critics dismiss his philosophy as naive and his
dialect style as exaggerated and self-conscious.
   Kay Cicellis, a novelist, reflected a common view among Greek
writers: ``I find Kazantzakis hopelessly old-fashioned. His ideas
belong in the 19th century and he forces the Greek language into a
rigid, unpleasant mold,''
   Readers disagree, and enthusiasm for Kazantzakis surmounts
social and regional differences.
   Ms. Angeliki-Rooke said: ``He catches the popular imagination in
a way that no other modern Greek writer has done. In a Greek home
with only a few books, one of them will surely be a Kazantzakis.''

<TEXT>
   Georgia Republicans spent more than six
months feuding over control of the party, and at the end of a
four-hour hearing on seating the state's delegation at the national
convention, they wanted more time.
   The Georgia GOP, which was overrun earlier this year by
dissidents and supporters of television evangelist Pat Robertson,
has tried to regroup after local conventions dissolved into shoving
matches, bullhorns and allegations of death threats.
   Moments after the state committee's counsel completed his
summation, the attorney for the challengers asked for an additional
10 minutes to present evidence.
   John McDonald of Iowa, chairman of the Committee on Contests,
ruled that that the case was closed. But Brant Frost IV, chairman
of the dissident delegation, stood up and asked to speak as a
private citizen whose reputation had been brought into question.
   The hearing remained closed.
   The Republican Party has been asked to settle challenges to as
many as 39 of the 48 delegates from Georgia, where Republican
nominee-to-be George Bush won the Super Tuesday primary but backers
of Robertson have tried to take over the state party.
   The committee, which ended the hearing after hours of testimony,
videotape presentations and boxes of evidence, planned to rule
sometime later in closed-door session and will announce its
decision when it reports to the full Republican National Committee
on Wednesday.
   ``What we are engaged in here today is not a petty squabble,''
Georgia GOP Chairman John Stuckey Jr. told the committee.
   Stuckey said that this was the ``opening battle in a war for
control of the Republican Party'' by ``zealots'' and ``traditional
malcontents.''
   However, both Stuckey and Matthew Patton, the attorney for the
opposing side, said the dispute was more complicated than a
disagreement over presidential politics.
   ``The element of Robertson vs. Bush has been greatly exaggerated
by the news media,'' said Patton, ``and picked up by the
opposition.''
   In fact, any decision over seating a delegation from Georgia
will not affect how the state's presidential votes are cast next
week at the national convention, but it will determine who casts
them.
   Because Bush won the March 8 primary, all 48 Georgia delegates
are required to vote for him at the national convention, but the
delegates themselves are picked through a process of caucuses and
conventions. It is in that process where the dissidents made their
moves, showing up in sufficient numbers to dominate the caucuses
and obtaining a series of court orders to counter attempts by the
state party to thwart them.
   The feud led to fistfights and shoving matches at one
congressional district convention and to an aborted state
convention where dissidents with bullhorns controlled the floor,
shouting down speakers on the podium.
   ``Any reasonable person would concur in my opinion that I had to
adjourn the convention to prevent a riot,'' Stuckey said of his
decision to gavel a close to the May convention. ``There was a
clear and present danger of mayhem.''
   As evidence, the state party showed a nine-minute videotape that
was a montage of television news stories about the district and
state conventions. The tape did show shouting and fist shaking at
the state convention but it did not show any violence there.
   Stuckey said he had been under guard because of a death threat
he had received at his hotel room in Albany, Ga.
   The challengers responded with their own videotape of the state
convention, showing Stuckey gaveling the event to order. Later,
after motions to replace the chairman, Stuckey gaveled the
convention closed. The tape also showed the dissident delegates
locked out of the convention hall.
   The state party spent much of Monday laying out its case, while
Patton used much of the dissidents' time to cross-examine the
party's witnesses.
   Either side can appeal the RNC's decision to the Credentials
Committee of the national convention. The ultimate authority on
challenges is the national convention itself.

<TEXT>
   The presidential campaign of Vice President
George Bush says a campaign-spending complaint filed with the
Federal Election Commission by four state Democratic Party chairmen
is ``ridiculous.''
   The four chairmen asked the FEC on Monday to investigate whether
the Bush campaign has violated ederal election law by exceeding
spending limits.
   ``We file this complaint today to formally raise the issues of
whether or not George Bush has mismanaged his campaign funds and
overspent the legal limit,'' said Richard Wiener of Michigan, one
of the filers and president of Association of State Democratic
Chairs.
   Mark Goodin, spokesman for the Bush campaign, called it a
``partisan challenge'' and said the campaign would welcome any
inquiry by the FEC.
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' said Goodin. ``This campaign has
bent over backwards to comply with the letter and the spirit of the
law.''
   Wiener said that as of June 30, Bush had spent $22.1 million of
the $23.1 million he is allowed to spend for all pre-nomination
campaign activities. That, Wiener said, left Bush with only
$943,000 to spend from July 1 through Aug. 18, when he is expected
to receive the GOP nomination.
   Wiener said Bush has spent an average of about $1 million per
month since March and traveled extensively in July, going to 15
cities in 14 states.
   ``Frankly, we as state chairs wonder just how he is able to do
all of the traveling that he's doing and all the campaigning he's
doing in our states on that relatively limited amount of money,''
said Wiener. ``It appears to us that the Bush campaign is using a
variety of techniques to avoid the spending cap.''
   Wiener said those techniques may include delaying the reporting
of campaign expenditures, trying to take unlawful advantage of a
loophole by allocating to state party committees or the national
committee travel costs for so-called ``party building activities,''
and characterizing some trips as official business when they are
essentially campaign appearances.
   ``As state chairs, we believe that from our observation
violations have occurred,'' said Wiener.
   In their complaint, the four chairmen ask the FEC to conduct an
immediate investigation into whether and by how much Bush has
exceeded the spending limit, to issue an order to the Bush campaign
to stop spending federal funds, and to suspend payment of any
outstanding matching funds that still may be owed to the campaign.
   In addition to Wiener, the other chairmen filing the complaint
were James Ruvolo of Ohio, Frank Holleman of South Carolina and
Richard Lodge of Tennessee.

   Next week's Republican National Convention will
have a distinct Texas accent, says the man who will nominate George
Bush for president.
   ``It is clear in this convention that I'm doing the nominating
and another Texan's doing the accepting, and that's pretty much
what conventions are about. So it's a Texas show from that point of
view,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Monday.
   However, Gramm said, those watching the GOP convention will hear
something quite different from last month's Democratic convention,
where Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards set the tone with several
wisecracks about Bush during her keynote speech including that the
wealthy vice president was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   ``You're going to see a stark contrast between my speech and the
speeches you heard at the Democratic convention,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he plans to use his speech to highlight the
differences between Vice President Bush and Dukakis.
   ``I am not a good name-caller. People don't care what I think
about Michael Dukakis in terms of some cutesy-poo thing I might
call him,'' he said.
   Still, Texas Republicans have a tough act to follow.
   Texas Democratic Party officials have referred jokingly to last
month's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta as their state
convention due to the prominent role played by Texans.
   Among them were Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the vice presidential
nominee; Ms. Richards, the keynoter; U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright
of Fort Worth, convention chairman; former U.S. Rep. Barbara
Jordan, who seconded Bentsen's nomination; Agriculture Commissioner
Jim Hightower, who gave a prime-time speech, and state Rep. Lena
Guerrero, D-Austin, who helped present the party platform to
delegates.
   Democrats also believe the selection of Bentsen as Dukakis'
running mate will help their ticket carry Texas, the nation's
third-largest state, and its 29 electoral votes. A total of 270
electoral votes are needed to win the presidency.
   ``The campaign in Texas is going to be a hotly contested
campaign,'' Gramm said. ``We've got to put before the people of
Texas those two records. If we don't win in Texas given Michael
Dukakis' record, we don't deserve to win.''

<TEXT>
   Hollywood stars turned out to support a
boycott of California table grapes by farm labor union leader Cesar
Chavez, who is bedridden in a hunger strike over pesticides.
   Monday was the 23rd day of his water-only fast, an effort to
gain support for the 4-year-old boycott that has been virtually
ignored by the public.
   Martin Sheen, Eddy Albert and Robert Blake were among the stars
who met six at a time Monday in private with Chavez before talking
with reporters. Chavez's fast has boosted levels of uric acid in
his system, threatening to cause kidney failure, his doctors said.
   ``A man (Chavez) is putting his life on the line so you will
wake up and save your own,'' said actress Rose Portillo, who
appeared in the film ``Zoot Suit.''
   Portillo was joined by about 20 actors who said that five
pesticides used on California table grapes threaten consumers, farm
workers and the environment.
   Growers deny that table grapes contain dangerous pesticide
residues.
   Chavez' United Farm Workers union has no contracts among
California table grape growers and the union has lost 30,000
dues-paying members during the last decade.
   Monday's meetings in this town 200 miles north of Los Angeles
was presided over by Luis Valdez, creator of ``Zoot Suit'' and a
longtime Chavez friend.
   Sheen led a ``meditation,'' asking all to hold hands. ``Let my
country awake,'' he said as he ended his prayer, with the stars
raising their clasped hands.
   ``The problem we are addressing today is silent and invisible.
It is the poison brought to us on our food,'' said Mike Farrell of
TV's old ``M-A-S-H'' series.
   Charlie Haid, who played Renko on the old ``Hill Street Blues''
series, said, ``Wake up! Your children will be the next victims.
The children here are the victims.''
   Asked about the labor leader's condition, actor Joe Spano of
``Hill Street Blues,'' said: ``He's happy for our support and he's
waiting to end his fast. He wants to end it.''
   Bruce Obbink, president of the California Table Grape
Commission, denied that table grapes contain dangerous pesticide
residues and said Chavez has a hidden political agenda in a dispute
over administration of the state's labor laws.
   ``If (Chavez) was really worried about the consumers' health and
the farm workers' health, then he would be saying ban the chemicals
from all products. The chemicals he's concerned about are used in
nearly every state in the United States and nearly everything in
the produce department,'' he said.

<HEAD>Alternative Service To Be Introduced Next Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist authorities say they will
next year introduce an alternative for those who refuse compulsory
18-month military service, making Hungary the second East bloc
country to offer the option.
   While general compulsory service would remain in effect, the
government newspaper Magyar Hirlap said Monday, ``in consideration
of Hungary's national and international interests, citizens are to
be given a choice ...''
   In June, Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to
establish an alternative civilian service.
   Last week, a senior Communist Party official disclosed that 590
conscientious objectors have refused to serve under arms in Hungary
since 1977.
   Ferenc Szombathelyi, deputy head of department in the party's
Central Committee, said 40 to 45 young people have been jailed
annually for refusing to bear arms.
   ``This practice must be changed now,'' he told the party daily
Nepszabadsag.
   At present, people who refuse mandatory military service in
Hungary for reasons of conscience or religion are imprisoned for up
to five years.
   However, Jehovah's Witnesses, members of the Church of the
Nazarene and Seventh-Day Adventists are exempted from military
service.
   According to Magyar Hirlap, the alternative service ``is not to
be punitive in nature, nor more attractive than the armed service,
and carries no (material) advantages.''
   ``The substitutory civilian service, the introduction of which
will require amendments in the defense law, will be adjusted to the
18-month long regular (military) national service,'' the daily said
without elaboration.

   Tropical Storm Beryl hovered off the
Louisiana coast Monday, forcing the evacuation of thousands of oil
rig workers in the Gulf of Mexico and driving vacationers away from
rain-drenched coastal resorts.
   Amid warnings of coastal tides five to seven feet above normal,
St. Bernard Parish officials evacuated the fishing villages of
Hopedale, Yscloskey and Shell Beach east of New Orleans late Monday
night.
   Beryl was upgraded Monday from a tropical depression after its
winds strengthened, reaching a sustained speed of 50 mph with
higher gusts in squalls up to 75 miles from the center.
   The storm formed inland over Lake Pontchartrain near New Orleans
and strengthened as it drifted closer to the warm Gulf of Mexico.
   The storm didn't deter Vice President George Bush from visiting
New Orleans on Monday where he addressed the 1988 Republican
Platform Committee. The Republican National Convention will be next
week Louisiana Superdome.
   ``Better this week than next week,'' said Bill Phillips,
convention manager.
   At midnight EDT, the storm's center was near latitude 29.5 north
and longitude 89.0 west, or about 65 miles southeast of New
Orleans. It had remained stationary for about six hours, after
earlier drifting slowly southeastward.
   Forecasters said Beryl was expected to begin a slow southerly or
southwesterly drift Tuesday with some strengthening possible and
possible flooding especially in coastal communities east of the
Mississippi River.
   ``It's highly unusual for depressions to form over land. Most of
the time they get their start way out in the middle of the ocean,''
said Jim Gross, a forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. ``We don't have a lot of experience with systems that form
this way.''
   A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds
hit 39 mph, and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph.
   Residents of south Louisiana, especially in coastal communities,
were warned to prepare for flooding from high tides.
   ``Right now we're advising people to listen to their radios and
watch television,'' said Andy Valence, mayor of Grand Isle, La.,
about 40 miles south of New Orleans in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Tropical storm warnings were posted from Morgan City, La., to
Pensacola in the Florida Panhandle; a small vessels warning was in
effect from Port O'Connor, Texas, to Pensacola.
   Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa said about 2,000 company workers
were removed Monday by boat and helicopter from facilities at
Venice and Leeville deep in Plaquemines Parish and at Morgan City.
   ``The concern is that the more it gets into the Gulf, the more
winds pick up. It is something we are very concerned about,'' Lifa
said.
   Jim Shugart, area manager for Petroleum Helicopters Inc.,
expected to spend the day getting workers out of danger.
   ``It looks like we're in for a full day of flying,'' he said.
``We'll just keep flying for as long as we can or until most of it
is over.''
   Beryl is the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season. The season's first tropical storm, Alberto, fizzled out
Monday near the Canadian coast. Shortly after noon Sunday, the
forecasters had issued a tropical storm warning for Maine's coast
from Bar Harbor to Eastport, but canceled it in less than six hours.
   Rain from Beryl battered coastal areas Monday in Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and some tourists cut their
vacations short.
   ``We've had a lot of checkouts,'' said JoAn Burt, general
manager at the 102-room Econo-Lodge in Gulf Shores, Ala.
   Carrie Thomas, who manages the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention
Center, said guests who checked out early Monday complained about
the weather. ``They don't want to get stuck in the event of a big
storm,'' she said.
   Meteorologist Tom Kriehn in Mobile, Ala., said residents there
could expect 5 or 6 inches of rain in the next day or two. But he
said Beryl could sit in the Gulf two or three days until it gains
strength or dies.
   Typically, there are 10 named storms during the six-month
hurricane season, which begins June 1. Last year, there were only
three hurricanes and four tropical storms in the Atlantic.
   The last major Gulf Coast hurricane was Camille in 1969, with
218 mph winds. It killed 320 people and did millions in damage.

   The love story-with-a-twist, ``Cocktail'' and
the animated antics of ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' gave Walt Disney
Co. a one-two lock on the weekend box office, pulling in $14
million in ticket sales nationwide.
   ``Cocktail,'' with Tom Cruise as a top-gun bartender who serves
up his trademark smile with a twist of lime, iced the competition
for a second week. It earned $8.2 million last weekend.
   The $5.8 million for ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' made it the
third Disney film this year to top $100 million in ticket sales.
The others were ``Three Men And A Baby'' and ``Good Morning,
Vietnam.''
   The Eddie Murphy comedy ``Coming to America,'' also topped the
$100 million mark.
   Another Disney film, ``The Rescue,'' and the horror remake ``The
Blob'' had soft openings but still made last weekend's top 10 list.
   ``Die Hard,'' the Bruce Willis action film about terrorism in a
skyscraper finished third with $5.7 million in sales, followed by
``Coming To America'' with $5 million.
   Next was the John Cleese caper comedy ``A Fish Called Wanda,''
which widened its fourth-week distribution to 616 screens and
earned $4.8 million for an average of $7,794 per screen.
   ``Midnight Run,'' with Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin, earned
$3.7 million for sixth place, while the longtime summer hit ``Big''
was in seventh with $2.7 million.
   ``The Blob,'' a remake of the 1958 drive-in thriller featuring
an amorphous mass that grows as it feeds on human victims, did an
anemic $2.6 million for its opening weekend at eighth place.
   ``The Dead Pool,'' the latest ``Dirty Harry'' movie from
actor-director Clint Eastwood, earned $2.2 million for ninth place.
   At No. 10 was ``The Rescue,'' a teen-adventure about a group of
young Americans who attempt to save their military fathers from
imprisonment in North Korea.
   Here are the top films for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater

   A typhoon that killed more than 50 people and
left at least 100 missing cut off power to the city of Hangzhou and
brought disaster to the coastal province of Zhejiang for the third
time this year.
   The typhoon buffetted northern Zhejiang on Monday with winds of
75 mph, uprooting trees, sinking boats and inflicting what the
official China Daily called the nation's heaviest economic losses
from a storm in 30 years.
   The People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) put the death toll at more
than 50 in the three cities of Ningbo, Huzhou and Jiaxing, saying
figures on casualties and damage were still incomplete.
   The storm hit Hangzhou, the provincial capital with a population
of 1.2 million, before dawn, ripping down trees and power lines and
cutting off electricity and water supplies, the official Xinhua
News Agency said.
   The overseas edition of the People's Daily said the storm sank
72 boats in the Qiantang River and off the coast, and that 110
fishermen and sailors were missing.
   Xinhua said two fishermen were killed. It said several people
were electrocuted in Hangzhou, but gave no figures.
   Vice Mayor Li Zhixiong was quoted as saying the storm knocked
down 90 of the city's 116 electric transmission lines, shutting
down at least half the industries in the city.
   An official of the provincial Foreign Affairs Office in
Hangzhou, Wang Weiliang, said by telephone that electricity had
been restored to some parts of the city and that water was again
running.
   He said train schedules in Hangzhou, a major transportation
center 111 miles south of Shanghai, were still disrupted.
   Wang said he had no figures for casualties or damage to Hangzhou.
   A Western reporter there said the storm uprooted hundreds of
trees, including those around the scenic West Lake, a major tourist
attraction in what is regarded as one of China's most beautiful
cities.
   The typhoon hit near Ningbo, a coastal city about 93 miles east
of Hangzhou that bore the brunt of a major flooding disaster in
late July.
   Heavy rains also hit Zhejiang, one of China's most heavily
populated and most prosperous provinces, in June.

   The United States will begin its first

Nuclear Forces treaty on Sept. 8.
   The Defense Department, in a brief statement Monday, said the
notice was forwarded to Moscow in accordance with the terms of the
treaty signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in Washington last year.
   Destruction of the solid-fuel rocket motors for the Pershing II
missiles will begin on Sept. 8, ``weather permitting,'' at the
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant near Marshall, Texas, the Pentagon
said.
   The treaty, which became effective earlier this summer, requires
the superpowers to dismantle and destroy the intermediate-and
shorter-range nuclear missiles in their arsenals. The United States
has two such types of missiles _ the ground-launched cruise missile
and the Pershing II.

   The House has approved legislation to bring
the United States into line with an international agreement to
combat illegal trafficking in African elephant ivory.
   The measure sent to the Senate by voice vote on Monday would
prohibit imports into this country of any ivory taken in violation
of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
   That worldwide agreement uses a system of quotas and ivory
markings in an effort to regulate the international trade in ivory
from African elephants, whose numbers have fallen to an estimated
700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979.
   The bill would ban importation of raw ivory from any nation
without a native elephant population and would prohibit exportation
of raw ivory from the United States.

<HEAD>Federal Appeals Court Upholds Minnesota Abortion-Notification Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. appeals court ruling upholding a
law requiring minors seeking abortions to notify both parents or
get judicial permission will have disastrous effects, a civil
liberties lawyer says.
   But a leader of Minnesota's largest anti-arbortion lobby said
the ruling will provide needed safeguards for pregnant teen-agers.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, by a 7-3
vote, overturned decisions by a federal judge and a three-judge
panel of the appeals court. The earlier rulings deemed the law
unconstitutional.
   Rachael Pine, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union
in New York, called Monday's ruling was ``a disaster for minors in
the state of Minnesota.'' The ACLU brought the class action lawsuit
on behalf of minors, a parent, four clinics and two physicians.
   Jackie Schwietz, executive director of Minnesota Citizens
Concerned for Life, an anti-abortion group, said the ruling
``affirms the right of minor girls to have their parents involved
in this important medical decision.''
   ``It's always amazed me that abortionists performing surgery on
a child would do so without knowing the impact on her health,''
Schwietz said. ``There's no way you can get an adequate history on
the girl without parental involvement. There are facts that may
only be available to the abortionist from the parents.''
   U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop of St. Paul in November 1986
barred the state from enforcing the notification law. Alsop said
the required 48-hour notice to both parents unduly burdened a
minor's right to seek an abortion, particularly when the pregnant
girl does not live with both parents.
   But Appeals Judge John R. Gibson, writing for the majority, said
the U.S. Supreme Court ``has recognized as a matter of law that
parental notice or consent requirements do not unconstitutionally
burden a minor's abortion rights when an appropriate judicial
bypass is in place.''
   The Supreme Court legalized abortion in its landmark 1973
decision based on women's right to control her body. But in 1981,
it allowed states to impose parental-notification requirements for
``immature'' girls still dependent on their parents.
   Pine said the Minnesota case was the nation's first in which the
courts considered a law involving restrictions on minors' access to
abortion that had been enforced.
   ``All other cases before the Supreme Court and lower courts have
been challenges brought before the laws took effect,'' Pine said.
``The others were based on speculation.''
   Pine said a decision whether to appeal the ruling to the U.S.
Supreme Court was being considered.
   Twenty-five states have laws that require minors seeking
abortions to notify or to obtain consent from at least one parent,
Pine said. Most of them allow minors to seek judicial approval to
get around the parental notification or consent requirement.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Donald Lay said the majority
``completely ignores the evidence amassed in a five-week trial and
the district court's findings of fact as irrelevant to the
constitutional issues.''
   The majority, Lay said, ``has created a new right, apparently of
constitutional dimension, for non-custodial parents to receive
notice of their minor children's activities.'' Upholding the
48-hour waiting period, Lay said, was ``contrary to nearly every
other court decision on this issue.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders DeSillers to Return Purchases Allegedly Made With
Donations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A luxury car, jewerly, clothes and other items
Maria DeSillers allegedly purchased with money donated for her
dying son's liver transplants must be returned today, a judge has
ruled.
   Dade Circuit Court Judge Francis Christie on Monday gave Ms.
DeSillers until 5 p.m. to turn over the property, which includes a
BMW automobile with cellular phone, more than $11,000 in jewelry
and a cemetery plot next to her son's grave.
   Christie also said Monday he will rule later this week on
whether to charge Ms. DeSillers with contempt for allegedly
withholding financial information from court-appointed curator
Karen Gievers.
   ``When is it all going to end?'' responded Ms. DeSillers, who
indicated she would appeal the ruling. ``I lost Ronnie. I lost it
all and they still want to keep on punching me.''
   Ms. DeSillers is accused of misusing some of nearly $689,000
donated for her 7-year-old son's three unsuccessful operations,
including $1,000 from President Reagan.
   The curator says the return of the items will aid the court's
efforts to account for the funds, even though Ms. DeSillers says
she bought the items with much of her own money.
   ``I'm really upset about what has happened, because I feel it is
unfair,'' Ms. DeSillers said. ``I feel the whole proceedings have
not focused on what the truth is, but is making up what they think
the truth is.''
   Ms. DeSillers' son, Ronnie, died in Pittsburgh's Children's
Hospital in April 1987 while awaiting his fourth liver transplant.
A $262,000 medical bill remains unpaid because Ms. DeSillers says
her son received inadequate medical care.
   Last month, Christie ruled Ms. DeSillers must give some of the
remaining $240,000 of the donations to groups helping needy and
sick children.
   A computer purchased by DeSillers was supposed to be used for
the now-defunct Ronnie DeSillers National Foundation. As head of
the foundation, Ms. DeSillers paid herself about $88,000 in salary
and other cash payments, Ms. Gievers said.
   She also gave a total of about $40,000 to her brother,
ex-husband, and ex-boyfriend, Ms. Gievers said.
   ``During this time, she did not work or have any other source of
income on her own,'' Ms. Gievers said. ``It was clear to me that
all the purchases ... were made with funds that were donated.''
   On Aug. 1, Fort Lauderdale police concluded Ms. DeSillers'
fingerprints do not match those found last year at an elementary
school where about $4,000 in donations for Ronnie was reported
stolen. Police would not say what information led them to request
her fingerprints.
   Leonard Robbins, an attorney for Ms. DeSillers, unsuccessfully
argued that she wanted to keep the cemetery plot so she could be
buried next to her son.
   ``That hurts the most,'' a teary-eyed Ms. DeSillers said after
the hearing. ``I don't care about anything else.''

   England ``celebreighted'' the birth of a royal baby at 8:18 p.m.
on the eighth day of the eighth month of 1988, tourists
``migreighted'' to the Kentucky town of Eighty Eight, and even
mathematicians ``apprecieighted'' the chubby numeral.
   Buckingham Palace announced Monday that the Duchess of York,
wife of Prince Andrew, gave birth to a 6 lb. 12 oz. daughter, their
first child, who is fifth in line to the British throne. Mother and
child are well, the palace said.
   A Palace statement said Andrew, the Duke of York and second son
of Queen Elizabeth II, was with his wife, the former Sarah
Ferguson, when she was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18
p.m. (19:18 GMT) today.''
   In Hackensack, N.J., Kelli-Lee O'Brien came into the world at
8:08 a.m. EDT Monday weighing 8 pounds, 8{ ounces. Her mother's
doctor, making his eighth delivery in his 2-week-old private
practice, has eight children.
   ``Everybody thought they were joking with all the eights coming
up,'' said Jean Werner, head nurse in the delivery unit at
Hackensack Medical Center.
   The magic of 8-8-88 wasn't lost on the Chinese, whose word for
eight, ``baat,'' rhymes with ``faat,'' the Cantonese word for
prosperity. They threw lavish parties.
   Merchants in Hong Kong used the date to promote everything from
Kentucky Fried Chicken to real estate, while Hong Kong gamblers
tested their luck in a special lottery with a sweetened jackpot.
   Michigan gamblers bought more than 10,520 state Lottery tickets
with the 8888 combination, and officials said Connecticut's state
lottery sold out its 8888 tickets when sales hit a predetermined
limit: $8 million.
   Tascosa National Bank in Amarillo, Texas, offered 88-day
personal certificates of deposit at 8[ percent interest (with a
minimum deposit of $8,888).
   Numerologists said Monday, 8-8-88, was especially lucky for
marriage, and thousands of Israeli couples had registered to marry
on the date. Reception halls around the country were booked solid,
the daily Jerusalem Post reported.
   In Eighty Eight, Ky., about 500 well-wishers cheered Tom Accardo
and Deborah Muhlbeier, who got married at 8:08 p.m. CDT. The bride
carried eight white roses. Their 8 foot, 8 inch-long wedding cake
was topped with an ``88.''
   ``Our marriage is magical. It's just the icing on the cake and
I'm telling you it's thick icing,'' said Mrs. Accardo, 34. ``The
biggest part of it is the people of Eighty Eight. The town has been
incredible.''
   The couple had not set a date yet when they learned of the
festivities planned in the small farm community of 150 residents,
from a television news report in their distant state of Wyoming.
   ``Deb just looked at me and said, `Wouldn't that be fun to go in
there and get married on 8-8-88 in Eighty Eight, Kentucky?'''
recalled Accardo, 29, a salesman.
   In attendance at Eighty Eight was Pearl Russie, who drove up to
the Eighty Eight Market in her Oldsmobile Delta 88. Her license
plate: ``ANY 88.'' As Ms. Russie, 45, explained: ``I'm an 88
freak.''
   Eighty Eight's post office handled 25,000 pieces of mail for
people wanting the EIGHTY-EIGHT 8-8-88 cancellation, said Fred Van
Fleet, the U.S. Postal Service's area manager.
   The day also began the centennial anniversary of the American
Mathematical Society based in Providence, R.I.
   ``Eight is, from a standpoint of pure arithmetic, the second
cube, the sixth Fibonacci number, and the sum of the first three
digits of pi,'' wrote former Scientific American magazine columnist
Martin Gardern in a news release.
   ``Applied to the outside world, eight takes on more glamour as
the notes of an octave, the arms of an octopus, the eight-cylinder
motor, stock market eighths, the figure-8 knot, the skater's figure
8, the eight-hour work day, behind the eight ball, old Spanish
pieces of eight, and the eighth wonder of the world.''
   At least until 9-9-99.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The housekeeper for Liberace sobbed as
she recounted how a doctor told her the entertainer was dying of
complications from AIDS, then repeated the news in front of him.
   Dorothy McMahon said she had not known the source of the
pianist's months-long illness until Liberace's physician, Ronald
Daniels, told her.
   ``He said by law he had to tell me what Liberace had, and he had
to tell me in front of Liberace,'' she testified in state court
Monday.
   Ms. McMahon, Liberace's housekeeper for 16 years; Liberace's
sister, Angie Liberace; and three others have filed suit in state
court seeking to have attorney Joel Strote removed as executor of
the will and head of the Liberace Foundation for the Performing
Arts, which provides scholarships to nearly 30 colleges and
universities.
   Ms. McMahon wept loudly as she told of the doctor checking a
sore on her hand and ordering her to wear gloves when treating the
entertainer. District Judge Michael Wendell ordered a break while
she regained her composure and the subject was dropped when
testimony continued.
   Ms. McMahon said she was informed of the cause of his fatal
illness Jan. 22, 1987, the day Liberace signed a new will making
Strote the executor of his estate. The plaintiffs say Liberace was
too ill to comprehend its meaning when the 1987 will was drawn by
Strote.
   Strote has testified that Liberace knew what he was doing when
the new will was drawn up and signed two weeks before his death on
Feb. 4, 1987.
   Ms. McMahon said Liberace in his final days could barely walk
and talk. She said she had to bathe Liberace and that he was unable
to walk by himself or to talk with people in the month before his
death.
   The housekeeper challenged testimony by Strote that he had
talked with Liberace by phone on Jan. 21 to review the will.
   ``The 21st was the worst day Liberace had,'' she said.
   On Jan. 22, Strote came to Liberace's Palm Springs, Calif., home
to have the will signed and witnessed.
   Liberace slipped into a coma Feb. 1 and never regained
consciousness.
   ``Angie and I would lay on top of him to keep him from shaking
so bad,'' Ms. McMahon said.
   The hearing on a legal challenge to Liberace's will resumed
Monday after being recessed earlier this summer to allow the court
to handle other matters.

   The three weeks of haggling over conditions
for an Iran-Iraq cease-fire are omens of hard bargaining ahead as
the war foes plunge into the process of peace after eight years of
fighting.
   Diplomats in Baghdad say that while a cease-fire may halt the
shooting fairly soon, efforts to keep the guns silent could stretch
on for years.
   It took three weeks for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to win agreement on truce conditions after both sides
finally agreed in principle to a cease-fire.
   Potential problems lie ahead at nearly every stage of the
U.N.-mandated cease-fire process and in the peace talks that are
supposed to follow.
   U.N. Security Council resolution 598 calls for both countries to
withdraw to internationally recognized borders, to exchange
prisoners, and for a commission to decide who started the war.
   Iraq and Iran do not agree on their borders. Some prisoners may
not want to go home. And an inquiry into the war's causes could
make both sides unhappy.
   Most serious of all, mutual distrust built up by eight years of
war and threats will make agreements difficult.
   ``I think it will be a long, protracted negotiation,'' said a
European diplomat in Baghdad.
   The war itself began along two disputed portions of a border
that Arabs, Persians and their predecessors have contested almost
since the dawn of civilization.
   The two countries remain at odds over the division of the Shatt
al-Arab waterway that separates southern Iraq from Iran as it flows
into the gulf, as well as over a sliver of land on the central
border.
   The Shatt poses little problem to a cease-fire withdrawal. ``You
can't stand in the middle of the river,'' one diplomat noted.''
   But it could be a tangled issue in peace talks. According to a
1975 treaty, which called for free navigation, the border was set
in the middle of the waterway. Before that, the border was set on
the Iraqi side, giving Iran control. The 1975 treaty was a victim
of the war.
   Diplomats in Baghdad said President Saddam Hussein's need to
demonstrate victory in the war could make Iraq stubborn on the
border question.
   Iraqis have insisted that any truce immediately open the Shatt,
their main outlet to the gulf, which was closed soon after Iraq
invaded in force on Sept. 22, 1980.
   Iraq says the war's first land battles took place on Sept. 4 and
7, 1980, when Iran shelled Iraqi cities from the Zayn al-Qaws area
which Iraq claimed under the 1975 treaty.
   Iraq responded by occupying it on Sept. 7. This area will be a
point of dispute in peace talks.
   Diplomats said snags also lurk in the exchange of prisoners.
   According to the International Red Cross, Iran held about 50,000
Iraqis, while Iraq had about 13,000 Iranian captives before recent
Iraqi attacks. Iraq claims attacks in the past month netted it
12,000 more Iranian prisoners.
   Diplomats say Iraqis fear Iran may have killed some Iraqi
prisoners _ a discovery that could endanger peace talks.
   A Western diplomat cited reports of clashes in Iranian camps
involving Iraqi prisoners who had come to support Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. Some Iranians held in Iraq have expressed public
support of Saddam.
   Both have reason to fear a return home.
   The U.N. measure calls for a commission to probe responsibility
for the war, a move taken to answer Iranian demands that Iraq be
branded the aggressor.
   But the composition and tasks given such a group could trigger
fierce argument _ especially if the committee's decisions affect
reparations.
   The Western diplomat said the committee could ask who was
``responsible for provoking, initiating and continuing the war.''
   He noted that Iraq could argue that Iran's threats and shelling
provoked the war and that Iran continued the conflict for years
after Iraq called for a halt. A narrower definition might favor
Iran, which dates the war to Iraq's invasion.

   Fireworks and gunfire pierced the sky in
the Iraqi capital early today and people danced in the streets as
the government declared victory in its eight-year war against Iran.
   Fireworks cascaded over the Tigris River that cuts through the
city and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition exploded against
the sky after the post-midnight announcement on Iraqi television.
   State-controlled TV and radio called on Iraqis to ``celebrate
the great victory achieved by Iraq'' on ``the greatest day of all''
and announced a three-day period of celebration.
   The celebrations followed an announcement Monday by U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that a cease-fire would
begin Aug. 20, followed by direct talks between Iraq and Iran.
   Men danced in the streets of Baghdad during the pre-dawn
celebrations and horn-honking cars loaded with jubilant Iraqis
waving palm and laurel branches drove wildly though the city.
   ``The war is over. Victory for Iraq,'' said a man at the
entrance to the Al-Rashid Hotel as he looked at a sky exploding
with gunfire.
   ``The war is over. Praise be to God,'' said a woman beside him.
   Tracer bullets, flares and machine-gun fire streamed into the
sky for hours after the announcement while bangs, booms and thuds
from anti-aircraft guns, rifles and pistols echoed though the city.
   Teen-agers in T-shirts fired off repeated rounds from automatic
rifles while stranded in a median of a street in the posh Mansour
district by a gridlock of noisy traffic at about 4:30 a.m.
   Jubilant soldiers blocked one of the city's main streets to
pound on cars and shake hands with passers-by.
   ``Here, take this,'' giddy security men told a reporter in front
of the Al-Rashid Hotel as they thrust a loaded Kalashnikov rifle
toward him.
   But instead of handing it to him, the guards turned and fired
the gun into the sky. They laughed with men guarding a government
building across the street, one of whom unleashed rounds from a
machine gun barely pointed in the air.
   One car in the hotel's parking lot showed a fresh bullet hole in
its hood.
   Children scampered about the parking lot and through the city
streets, collecting empty rifle cartridges that clattered from the
guns.
   Many Iraqis waved flags from car windows and some donned wreaths
of laurels and sat atop the hoods of speeding sedans flashing
victory signs at those they passed.
   The emotional outpouring was in sharp contrast to the reserve
with which Iraqis greeted Iran's July 18 announcement that it had
accepted a cease-fire in principle.
   The war has cost the two nations an estimated one million lives,
and by some estimates a total of $400 billion.

   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
Tuesday, while share prices declined for the third consecutive
trading day.
   The dollar opened at 133.62 yen, down from Monday's 133.97 yen
close, and remained in a narrow range between 133.52-133.73 yen. It
finished Tuesday's trading at 133.58 yen, down 0.39 yen from Monday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 109.06-point loser Monday, lost 82.76 points or
0.29 percent to close at 28,170.36. The index also finished lower
in Saturday's half-day session.
   Traders said most market participants were monitoring the U.S.
currency's movements against the West German mark. The dollar
reached 1.90 marks during Monday's trading, a level not seen since
January 1987.
   West Germany's Bundesbank intervened in the market sporadically
to keep the dollar from rising too sharply against the mark on
overseas markets.
   Dealers on the stock exchange said the market remained
relatively quiet because of the summer holidays.
   Volume on the first section was a light 650 million shares.

   Some say it's Bigfoot. Some say it's
only a bear. To some, the creature described as 7 feet tall with
red eyes and three-fingered hands that quickly became known as the
Lizard Man is simply a hoax.
   Whichever explanation one believes, there's no question
Lizardmania has seized this rural commmunity this summer.
   It all started when 17-year-old Christopher Davis told police he
had been attacked by a creature while changing a tire in nearby
Scape Ore Swamp about 2 a.m. one morning back in June.
   The creature, he said, was more than 7 feet tall, was
black-green and grabbed the door of his car, running as fast as 35
mph as he fled.
   Davis said he swerved along the road before the creature, which
had jumped on his car, was thrown off. ``It was strong and it
wasn't an animal and it wasn't no man,'' he told Sheriff Liston
Truesdale.
   As word of the sighting spread, hundreds of outsiders came to
walk through the swamp west of town. A Columbia radio station
offered a $1 million reward and reporters descended on the quiet
farming community of about 3,500.
   Sheriff's department spokesman Billy Moore said he has no doubt
there was something on the road with Davis that night.
   ``I believe he saw something. What it was I have no earthly
idea. But it wasn't no Lizard Man,'' he said.
   It may have been a bear, Moore suggested. Or, he said, it could
have been people stopping by an artesian well in the area. He said
locals are known to frequent the well at all hours of the day and
night.
   Scape Ore Swamp got its name in Revolutionary War days. It was
near a British encampment and, when the Americans moved against the
area, the British camp followers escaped into the swamp.
   What became known as Escaped Whore Swamp became shortened over
time to Scape Ore, Moore said.
   Since the sighting, however, the sheriff's department has
received dozens of calls from townspeople when their dogs bark at
night or their farm animals act strangely.
   ``I think most of the people think it's a prankster or a joke,''
Moore said.
   ``You're dealing with a skunk ape, which is a colloquial name,''
said Erik Beckjord, who has researched the creatures for 10 years.
``You can call it anything you want but it's a Bigfoot.''
   Authorities say there have been hoaxes as Lizardmania spread.
Deputies made plaster casts of large tracks purportedly made by the
creature. Moore said wildlife biologists determined the tracks were
man-made.
   Last week, an unidentified man reported shooting the thing along
Interstate 20, and gave authorities some scales and blood that
purportedly came from the creature.
   The blood and scales, headed for a state crime lab for analysis,
apparently are from a dead fish, the sheriff said. ``It doesn't
take an expert to see what they are.''
   Visitors have been pulling off Interstate 20 for the past few
weeks to satisfy their curiosity about the Lizard Man.
   Marina Watson of the local Chamber of Commerce said business has
been brisk this summer, but she had no estimate of how much money
Lizardmania has put into the local economy.
   If it's Lizard Man paraphernalia you're after, there are hats,
T-shirts, inflatable toy dinosaurs and even wanted posters with an
artist's impression of the Lizard Man.
   Truesdale has had enough. He said that when stories like the
Lizard Man circulate, ``a lot of people try to get publicity and
feel important. We have enough to do without tracking down things
like this.''
   Sitting on a counter in the Sheriff's Department is a can
labeled as Liz-A-Rid repellent _ a can that appears to have nothing
in it.

   Astronomers searching for radio signals from
intelligent life beyond the Earth say circumstantial evidence is
growing that humankind is not alone in the universe.
   Reports of the discovery of new planets and of the presence of
complex organic chemicals on comets are ``encouraging'' Michael J.
Klein, manager of NASA's radio search for life, said Monday.
   Research announced at the International Astronomical Union's
20th assembly last week showed the discovery of at least 10
planet-like objects in orbit of distant stars. Other studies showed
that comets and cosmic dust particles contain the complex organic
compounds that are thought to have been the chemical precursors of
life.
   ``That is the circumstantial evidence that life exists
elsewhere,'' Klein said. ``We know now that the materials are
there. It gives us a good feeling that we are on the right track.''
   Klein heads a project called the Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, or SETI, that is planning to mount an intensified
search for radio signals from civilizations that may exist on
planets orbiting distant stars.
   Programs run by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, Harvard University and others have listened for
intelligence-directed radio signals for more than 20 years, but
only a small fraction of the vast universe and the many radio
frequencies that must be monitored actually have been checked.
   The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is operated by the
California Institute of Technology for NASA, has proposed expanding
the effort with sophisticated new equipment that would listen to
tens of millions of channels at the same time. The equipment would
be monitored by a computer capable of identifying signals that
could be sent by intelligent life.
   Klein said the new equipment would be able to look at 1,000
different stars that are thought to be similar to the Earth's sun,
locations that experts believe hold the best chance for the
evolution of life.
   There also would be ``whole sky survey'' in many radio
frequencies in which every portion of the heavens would be searched
systematically.
   Searches in the past ``have only scratched the surface,'' said
Klein.
   The new equipment would be 10 million times more thorough than
present equipment, he said, noting, ``In the first few minutes, we
would be able to match all of the searches that were done before.''
   But even with the new devices, the job is immense, said Frank
Drake, chairman of a SETI committee of the astronomical union and
an astronomer at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
   ``Many people think the project should succeed in the next year
or two,'' he said. ``That's probably not going to happen. The
universe is so huge and the cosmic haystack so large, it will take
us decades.''
   But Drake added: ``The consequences of success are so great that
it's worth dealing with the problems.''
   The theory behind the SETI work is that because there are
billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars, the odds are
good that the conditions that permitted life to evolve on Earth
also exist elsewhere.
   If so, then intelligent life could have developed along the same
lines as it did here on Earth. Civilizations that are equal to or
more advanced than humankind would be sending out signals, just as
occurs on Earth. The SETI project is looking for those signals.
   Such signals may ``leak out'' just as they do on Earth, Drake
said.
   ``The strongest sign of our existence in the universe is the
accumulation of our television signals,'' he said. The second most
common radio signal from Earth comes from military communications.
   Klein said the federal budget now under consideration by
Congress includes a $6 million appropriation for the enhanced SETI
equipment. He said the total project would last 10 years and cost
$90 million.
   If the funding were approved, the intensified search could begin
in 1992, with all of the new equipment operating by 1994.

<HEAD>Court: Herpes Sufferers Have Legal Duty To Avoid Infecting Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   People suffering from genital herpes have
a legal duty to exercise reasonable care to avoid transmitting the
disease, the state Court of Appeals ruled today.
   A three-judge panel unanimously held that a man may have cause
for action against his ex-wife for negligent and-or fraudulent
transmission of genital herpes.
   The opinion, which identified the man and the woman only by
initials, reversed part of a lower court's summary judgment in
favor of the woman.
   Judge Marianne Short, writing for the panel, said the case was
the first time Minnesota courts had considered the issue of
negligent, fraudulent or intentional transmission of genital herpes
or for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
   Genital herpes, a sexually transmitted virus infection, ``is a
contagious and debilitating disease,'' the court said. ``It is
extremely painful and often leads to serious physical and
psychological complications. It is presently incurable, and is
spreading at an alarming and dangerous rate.''
   The court said a ``reasonable person should know that if he or
she has a contagious, sexually transmissible disease like genital
herpes, the disease is likely to be communicated through sexual
contact.
   ``Thus, people suffering from genital herpes generally have a
duty either to avoid sexual contact with uninfected persons or, at
least, to warn potential sex partners that they have herpes before
sexual contact occurs.''
   The court rejected an argument by the woman that the recognition
of a ``duty to warn'' was an undue invasion of privacy.
   ``On balance, we believe that society's interest in preventing
the spread of a dangerous, incurable disease justified some
intrusion into personal privacy,'' the court said.
   In the case before it, the court said, there was a factual
dispute.
   The woman contended she told the man she had herpes two weeks
after she met him, while he maintained that she did not tell him
until after they were married and he had contracted herpes from
her, according to court documents.
   The court sent the case back to trial court for resolution of
that issue and of whether the woman's alleged negligence caused the
man any compensable damage.
   It also ordered the trial court to determine whether the man can
prove the necessary elements of fraud, rejecting the woman's
assertion that fraud actions may arise only in business or
contractual contexts.
   The Appeals Court upheld the lower court's finding that the
man's allegations that his former wife committed battery by
deliberately having sexual contact with him knowing that she had
genital herpes and that she ``recklessly and intentionally'' caused
him emotional distress were barred by a two-year statute of
limitations.
   It also upheld the trial court's rejection of the man's claims
for money damages based on his allegation that the woman had
misrepresented facts about her ``background and upbringing'' while
they were dating.

   Mathematicians gathered here to
celebrate a century of advances that have benefitted fields ranging
from medicine to business and have seen American scientists rise to
the top of the discipline.
   ``When we talk about mathematics generally 100 years ago it was
a thriving enterprise,'' said Ronald Douglas, 49, dean of physical
science and mathematics at the University of New York at Stony
Brook. ``Even so whole new areas have been developed.''
   Douglas was one of about 1,300 mathematicians here for a
weeklong meeting that opened Monday to celebrate the centennial
anniversary of the American Mathematical Society.
   ``Geometricians who lived 100 years ago would not believe how
large the field has become,'' he said. ``It now interacts with all
of the sciences, with biology, with business, with medicine, with
economics. I think this would surprise people.''
   The computer alone has allowed mathematicians to solve problems
today that only existed in theory 20 or 30 years ago, he said.
   Douglas said the advances in mathematics in the United States
have been remarkable.
   ``Mathematics had a small number of American mathematicians _
all of them trained in Europe,'' said Douglas. ``Now American
mathematics is pre-eminent in the world, having the leadership in
many areas of mathematics. People come from all over the world to
study here. Europe is still important but the balance has shifted.''
   Mathematics will continue to move further into medicine and
biology, and new understandings in physics will allow
mathematicians to develop better machines and computers, he said.
   The society, originally named the New York Mathematical Society,
was formed in 1888 by a small group of mathematicians. It moved its
headquarters to Providence in 1951.
   This week's meeting is one of two the society holds each year in
conjunction with the Mathematical Society of America, society
spokeswoman Kathleen Holmay said.
   Speakers will address issues ranging from computer graphics to
the problems of attracting women to the field. Only about 15
percent of the society's 21,000 members are female, Ms. Holmay said.
   Of the 18 speakers at the conference, only one is a woman. Karen
K. Uhlenbeck, 46, a mathematics professor at the University of
Texas in Austin, will speak Friday on ``Instantons and their
Relatives.'' Instantons are geometric objects discovered by
physicists.

   Mohammed Ali Hamadi, on trial for
air piracy and murder in the 1985 TWA hijacking, on Tuesday
admitted he was one of the four hijackers but said it was not he
who killed the American sailor.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days and U.S.
Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed during the ordeal, which ended
in Beirut.
   In the last court session before a summer recess, the Lebanese
Shiite Moslem defendant for the first time acknowledged publicly
that he was one of the four gunmen who commandeered the
Athens-to-Rome flight.
   ``If this act which I committed is against the law, then it is a
result of illegal conduct on the part of Israel,'' Hamadi, speaking
in Arabic, said through an interpreter. He made the admission while
reading from a prepared statement in the heavily guarded courtroom.
   Hamadi previously has denounced Israel for allegedly causing
problems in his native Lebanon, and has also condemned the United
States.
   While the United States and West Germany had said Hamadi was one
of the four, there previously had remained questions about a
precise identification from photographs taken at the scene.
   Hamadi told the court he took part in the hijacking in an
attempt to free Shiite Moslems held in Israeli prisons. Shortly
after the June 1985 hijacking ended, Israel released approximately
700 Shiites.
   While Hamadi admitted to being one of the hijackers, he denied
shooting Stethem and throwing on an airport runway in Beirut.
   ``The pistol was in his (alleged hijacker Hassan Iz-al-Din's)
hand,'' Hamadi said. ``I didn't use it. Our orders were not to harm
anyone, but I couldn't convince him not to shoot.''
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem of Waldorf, Md.,
were sitting in the courtroom as Hamadi spoke.
   ``I took part in the hijacking,'' Hamadi said.
   The trial, which started in July, was to adjourn later Tuesday
until Sept. 6, when members of the crew of the TWA plane are
scheduled to begin testifying.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987 when
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   He has admitted in court to trying to smuggle explosives into
West Germany, a third charge raised against him.
   The West German government denied U.S. requests to extradite
Hamadi.
   Hamadi's older brother, Abbas, was convicted by a West German
court in April of masterminding the kidnapping of two West Germans
in Beirut in an attempt to force the West German government to free
Mohammed.
   Abbas was sentenced to 13 years in prison.
   One West German, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September 1987,
but the second, Rudolf Cordes, remains a hostage.

   The Soviet military, complying with the superpower
treaty banning medium-range missiles, has begun dismantling
transports and launchers for the weapons at a base in the Ukraine,
the Tass news agency reported.
   Tass said Monday that U.S. observers were on hand to look over
18 launchers to be destroyed during August. The first batch of four
missiles was blown up Aug. 1 at a test range in the Central Asian
republic of Kazakhstan.
   The superpowers signed the treaty banning medium-and-shorter
range missiles in December, the Soviets promising to destroy 1,752
missiles that have been deployed or are in storage. The missiles,
known as SS-20s in the West, have a range of 300 to 3,500 miles.
   The Tass account of the operation did not say how long it would
take to destroy the weapons, launchers and transports, or how long
the U.S. observers would stay in the Ukraine.

   ``The base is here, the music is here,'' said Tony Petkovsek,
chairman of the committee organizing the museum. ``Cleveland is the
polka capital of America.''
   Polka King Frankie Yankovic, who in 1986 became the first polka
artist to win a Grammy, lives here when he's not on tour with his
band. He is one of an estimated 80,000 Slovenians living in
Cleveland, more than anywhere else in the world outside Yugoslavia,
said Petkovsek.
   ``Polkas have sparked up a bit,'' Yankovic, 73, said last week
from his hotel in New Orleans where he was playing polkas for the
Fraternal Order of Eagles convention. ``Now disc jockeys are
playing it and teenagers are starting to try it. They can't really
dance it but they and jump around and have a good time.''
   The National Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame will be in the
Euclid Civic Center. Petkovsek said it will document the evolution
of Slovenian folk music into Cleveland-style polka. Artifacts,
recordings, button box accordions and items honoring individuals
and bands will be on display, he said.
   There is already a Polka Hall of Fame and Museum in Chicago _
Yankovic was the first polka artist inducted there _ but the
Chicago museum's emphasis is on the Polish polka, said Yankovic,
who has been touring the country for 57 years, entertaining crowds
at county fairs, conventions and polka festivals.
   Petkovsek said Cleveland's reputation as the polka capital and
the emphasis on the Cleveland style are why the hall is being
established here.
   ``Slovenian is more middle-of-the-road. Polish has more brass,
more of a hop,'' Petovsek said. ``Bohemian has more brass, and
German is more oom pah pah _ they'll have tubas, baritones and
trumpets. Slovenians will have an accordian, sax, drum, bass and
perhaps a banjo and guitar.''
   Voinovich, a museum committee member, said he first danced the
polka as a boy and later, as a member of the Ohio House of
Representatives in 1967, introduced legislation designating
Cleveland as polka capital of the world.
   ``From a cultural, national standpoint, the polka has brought a
tremendous amount of enjoyment to millions of Americans,''
Voinovich said.
   Cleveland once had a weekly television show ``Polka Varieties.''
Petkovsek has been host of a daily polka radio hour for 27 years.
   In fact, Petkovsek has built his livelihood on a business
centered on the polka.
   Tony's Polka Village, where Petkovsek broadcasts his radio show,
sells records and tapes from what he describes as the largest
collection of polka music in the world. Petkovsek is partner in a
travel agency that conducts polka tours around the world.
   Petkovsek said he has taken up to 400 members of polka bands on
tours to Europe, South America and Australia. Band members bring
their instruments and play at taverns and listen to local polka
bands.

<HEAD>New Central Park Zoo Opens Amid Fishfare</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Looking for lions and tigers and other big
animals? Not in the new Central Park Zoo.
   The zoo, which officially opened amid much fanfare Monday,
instead has a more eclectic offering: the Golfodulcean Dart poison
frog, the tufted puffin, the plumbeous water redstart (that's a
bird, folks).
   ``It doesn't seem like a zoo to me. It doesn't have any
elephants or any giraffes,'' complained Daniella Alonzo, 10, one of
the first visitors to the $30 million renovation, who nevertheless
said the zoo was ``nice.''
   There are 450 animals from more than 100 species. Unlike the old
zoo, the new zoo has no large animals because of space.
   ``This is a mini-zoo, to show things likely to arouse people's
interest and a sense of caring,'' said Dr. William G. Conway,
general director of the New York Zoological Society, which runs the
zoo for the city Parks Department.
   A 4-block-long line snaked through the park within an hour of
the opening as the new attractions, housed in three different
``habitats,'' drew 13,701 first-day visitors. Most didn't share
Daniella's disappointment.
   ``These animals know how to act. They're not like people, who
have to learn how to act,'' said 11-year-old Patricia Benitez, who
toured the Tropic Zone habitat with classmates from her Manhattan
day camp.
   Monkeys, bats, fish and frogs were featured there; the Polar
Circle is home to polar bears, penguins and arctic foxes; the
Temperate Territory is home to otters, red pandas, turtles and sea
lions.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch cut the ribbon to officially open the new
zoo before playing straight man to a frisky sea lion named Finn.
   Finn, circling in the newly renovated sea lion tank in the
middle of the park, waved to Koch, waved to the visitors, caught
fish tossed by the mayor and barked on request.
   The renovation was supposed to cost $28 million, but came in at
about $30 million, partly because work took several months longer
than anticipated, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said. Construction
began in April 1985.
   The commissioner was enthusiastic over the results. ``The other
zoo was like a Sing-Sing for animals,'' said Stern, referring to
the zoo that was shut down in the winter of 1983. ``So we've built
a humane zoo, a zoo for the 1990s.''
   There was one other new feature: visitors, who once toured for
free, now pay $1; senior citizens pay 50 cents, while kids come
through for a quarter.
   ``When I learned they were charging, I insisted the zoo has got
to cost less than an ice cream cone. If you can find an ice cream
cone for less, I'd like to see it,'' said Stern. ``Times have
changed.''

<HEAD>North Korea Demands Urgent Talks On Olympics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea called today for urgent
parliamentary talks on its demand to co-host the Olympic Games and
rejected South Korea's proposal for preliminary negotiations.
   The communist North said it would agree to a meeting Aug. 17 to
handle logistical arrangements for inter-parliamentary talks on the
Olympics and a non-aggression pact. But it rejected a South Korean
call for detailed preliminary talks on working out an agenda for
full-scale negotiations.
   ``Time is too short to take the form of holding a preliminary
contact and then the full talks under the present condition where
40 days ... are left until the opening of the Olympic Games that
must be debated as an urgent agenda item,'' the letter said.
   The Olympic Games start Sept. 17 in Seoul and North Korea has
said it will boycott unless it can co-host the event.
   The letter from Yang Hyong Sop, chairman of the north's
rubberstamp Supreme People's Assembly, said the body wants the
first full meeting of both parliaments to be held in its capital of
Pyongyang.
   It was addressed to South Korean National Assembly speaker Kim
Chae-sun.
   The tough North Korean letter, delivered at the border truce
site of Panmunjom, said just three to five delegates from each side
should attend the Aug. 17 meeting rather than the 15-member
delegations proposed by Seoul.
   South Korea, which had tentatively accepted a North Korean call
last month for legislative talks on the Olympics and a
non-aggression pact, wants detailed preliminary talks to set an
agenda. It called for the preliminary negotiations this week.
   South Korean officials believe contacts with the north reduce
potential threats to the Olympics and they indicate privately the
hope of keeping Pyongyang talking until after the Games.
   North Korea, on the other hand, still hopes to force Seoul to
agree to co-hosting. If it cannot co-host the Games, observers say
the north needs an excuse and the failure of non-aggression talks
might enable it to blame the south.
   Most observers believe there is little chance of North Korea
dropping its co-hosting demand and taking part in the Olympics.
Such a change would represent a total turnabout after 40 years of
bitter rivalry for supremacy between the two sides.
   The north invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War and
the two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was
signed when an armistice halted fighting in 1953.

   Four young adults whose bodies were
found huddled in a tiny dental storage room died apparently from
asphyxiation after the inhaled laughing gas, authorities said.
   The bodies were found Monday near an open, empty tank of
laughing gas, authorities said.
   The bodies were taken to the State Medical Examiner's Office for
autopsy, but Iron County Attorney Scott Burns said preliminary
investigation showed they were asphyxiated after apparently
inhaling the colorless anesthetic, nitrous oxide.
   ``It's just a tragic accident and our hearts go out to the
families,'' he said. ``We've never had injuries or deaths due to
nitrous oxide.''
   But he said, ``It's common throughout the United States for
people to try to gain access to that (nitrous oxide) to try to get
high.''
   He identified the victims as Owen Marc Gregerson, 18 and Shawn
Williams, 19, both of Cedar City; Christine Cherie Miller, 20,
Fillmore; and Margaret J. Probert, 20, Scipio.
   The 6-by-6-foot storage room was adjacent to Gregerson's
father's dental clinic.
   Burns and Police Chief Pete Hansen said there was no sign of
forced entry, and a key was found in a jacket outside the storeroom.
   It appeared they let themselves into the storage area late
Sunday or early Monday and turned on the gas, which was in a large
tank, similar to a welding tank, the officials said.
   There is no suspicion of suicide or foul play, Hansen said.
   The bodies were found by an employee who had gone to the
storeroom to get a cannister of gas and described ``a tangle of
bodies _ a gruesome scene,'' Hansen said.
   Authorities described the victims as clean-cut youths with no
history of illegal activity or drug use.

<HEAD>Safety Officials Call For More Controller Training for O'Hare
International</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crowded skies above O'Hare International
Airport and basic errors by its air traffic controllers have
prompted federal aviation officials to scrutinize operations at the
world's second-busiest airport.
   The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday called for a
``back-to-basics'' training program for traffic controllers at
O'Hare to counter an unusually high number of controller errors.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials say they also plan a
broad review of operations at O'Hare.
   After a special investigation, the NTSB recommended that
controllers at O'Hare be provided with new and better equipment and
that the FAA find ways to increase controller staffing, reduce peak
traffic loads, improve training and develop better quality
assurance.
   The FAA declined to comment directly on the recommendations, but
said it plans its own review of O'Hare by a team of agency and
industry experts, with a report to be submitted to FAA
Administrator Allan McArtor by Sept. 20.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said in Washington, D.C., the review
will go beyond air traffic control questions and will include an
examination of the airport's overall operation.
   More than 50 organizations have been invited to participate in
the review, including representatives from the airlines, pilots
union, various aviation organizations and the city of Chicago,
Farrar said.
   A spokesman for airline pilots said safety concerns aren't
unique to O'Hare.
   ``The thing to focus on is that we have overcrowded skies and an
insufficient number of controllers,'' said Capt. James Damron, a
spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association in Chicago.
   ``We recognize the problems,'' he said. ``We are supportive and
optimistic about our collective ability to produce some
suggestions.''
   Damron blamed the troubles on the firing of striking air traffic
controllers by President Reagan in August 1981. Some have been
hired back, but not enough to keep up with the growing demand,
Damron said.
   ``There have not been enough applicants, and they have not been
able to produce enough controllers,'' Damron said.
   O'Hare Airport handles an average of nearly 2,200 takeoffs and
landings a day. Its 796,939 arrivals and departures last year, were
second only to Atlanta's Hartsfield International.
   Last year O'Hare handled more than 56 million passengers, more
than any other airport. But the airport has been the subject of
numerous investigations by the FAA, the NTSB and congressional
committees because of safety concerns.
   The latest NTSB investigation was prompted by reports in June
that controllers had committed 19 operational errors where aircraft
had been allowed to fly dangerously close to one another, seven
more than during all of 1987.
   After examining these incidents, NTSB investigators concluded
that in many cases controllers failed to follow procedures and in a
majority of the cases the errors involved a ``breakdown in basic
(air traffic control) skills.''
   The safety board said that in many cases the controllers'
performance was affected by ``excessive workload, lack of
attentiveness, forgetting, perceptual problems, fatigue, and
excessive time on position without a break.''
   The board said it was ``concerned that these controllers,
working at one of the nation's busiest terminal radar facilities
failed to act in accordance with basic controller standards and
principles,'' and it questioned the effectiveness of the FAA's
overall quality control program.
   The NTSB also said it was concerned about excessive overtime
among controllers, shortages of controllers and the need for better
equipment.

   As dawn breaks over the Persian Gulf on
Aug. 20, Iran and Iraq's guns are to fall silent after eight years
of war that have claimed the lives of up to 1 million people.
   Peace talks to end the deadly conflict will begin five days
later in Geneva.
   ``The restoration of peace will bring to the peoples of both
countries victories far greater than those of war,''
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Monday in announcing
the truce.
   The Security Council meets today to authorize a 350-man unarmed
U.N. peacekeeping force to monitor a cease-fire and troop
withdrawals.
   ``I have been assured by the two parties to the conflict that
they will observe this cease-fire in the context of the full
implementation of Resolution 598,'' the Security Council's
comprehensive peace plan, said Perez de Cuellar.
   ``The governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the
Republic of Iraq have also agreed to the deployment of United
Nations observers as of the time and date of the cease-fire.''
   Perez de Cuellar did not announce dates for a troop withdrawal,
prisoner exchange or other elements of the year-old U.N. peace plan.
   The populations and economies of both Iran and Iraq have been
exhausted by a war fought with modern weapons but with tactics that
harked back to the most brutal campaigns of World War I: set-piece
battles, trench warfare, mustard gas attacks, human wave assaults.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran told reporters on
Monday: ``I wish to declare my government is prepared to accept the
demand of the secretary-general and that of the entire world
community to refrain from any military action on land, sea and air,
starting today. ...
   ``Let me express my sincere hope that today's historic
announcement will be the first step in the implementation of all
provisions of Resolution 598, and the achievement of a just,
comprehensive and honorable setttlement, returning peace and
stability to all the region,'' he added.
   Ambassador Ismat Kittani of Iraq told reporters: ``Now we begin
the arduous but happy march that begins from here. I am sure it
will not be a smooth road, but it will be much more pleasant than
fighting and bloodshed.''
   The cease-fire agreement was announced after a weekend of
feverish negotiations in which Iraq gave up its demand for
face-to-face talks with Iran as a precondition to a truce.
   On July 18, Iran abandoned its longstanding insistence that Iraq
be branded the aggressor in the war as a first step toward peace,
ending a year-long stalemate in peace efforts.
   One provision of Resolution 598 will establish an impartial
commission to judge responsibility for the conflict, and Velayati
made it clear Iran hopes this commission will blame Iraq for
starting it.
   War broke out in September 1980 when Iraq invaded Iran after a
series of clashes along the Shatt-al-Arab waterway that separates
them. The waterway is Iraq's only outlet to the gulf.
   On Monday, the secretary-general's office released a report
saying the gulf peacekeeping mission may include a small naval
patrol for the waterway, the first time the United Nations has
planned to commission a fleet.
   The report estimates the cost of the unarmed peacekeeping force
at $74 million for the first six months, of which $47 million would
be start-up costs. The United Nations will assess its 159 members
for the cost of the mission.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said Monday that about 25
nations would send officers to the force to be called the U.N.
Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group.
   He declined to name the countries, but said it was unlikely that
any of the permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain, France or China _ would send troops.
   If the cease-fire plan takes hold, as diplomats and observers
believe it will, it will be the United Nations' second major
peacekeeping success this year.
   In April, Pakistan and Afghanistan's pro-Moscow regime signed a
peace accord in Geneva for the withdrawal of more than 100,000
Soviet troops from Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes today blasted a
guerrilla base and a PLO-run radio station, knocking it off the
air. Police said at least three guerrillas were killed and 12
wounded in the attack near this southern port city.
   A police spokesman said six Israeli warplanes fired 26 missiles
in 14 attacks on a building housing offices and studios of the
Voice of Palestine radio and an adjacent guerrilla base southeast
of Sidon.
   He said the two-hour Israeli attack, the longest in Lebanon this
year, began at 10 a.m. The three people killed were at the
guerrilla base, police said.
   The police spokesman said most of the missiles hit the ground
floor of the radio station building.
   An Israeli army spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed the raid. He
said the station was used to broadcast instructions to Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied territories, where unrest has claimed more
than 200 lives since December.
   ``The base in southeast Lebanon was a radio station used for
propaganda and incitement broadcasts, and to pass orders for
executing terror attacks,'' he said. He spoke on condition of
anonymity in keeping with military regulations.
   All the planes returned safely, he said.
   The police spokesman, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said: ``The ground floor, which is the only visible part of the VOP
building, was totally demolished by the first four missiles.
   ``It seems that the Israelis are trying also to demolish the
three underground floors of the radio.''
   Palls of thick black smoke billowed from the building and the
nearby base, about a half mile south of the Mieh Mieh Palestinian
refugee camp on Sidon's southeastern edge.
   Rescuers in a dozen ambulances and fire engines arrived at the
stricken building a half hour after the raid ended and dug into
VOP's three underground floors to rescue anyone who might be
trapped, the spokesman said.
   The radio station, according to the police spokesman, was
founded early in June and beamed special programs to the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, in a statement blared by
loudspeaker vans, called for urgent blood donations at Mieh Mieh
and the nearby camp of Ein el-Hilweh.
   The police spokesman said the raiding jets fired scarlet
balloons to deflect heat-seeking, shoulder-held missiles fired by
Palestinian guerrillas.
   Witnesses in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, said guerrilla
defenders firing their anti-aircraft guns missed the raiding jets.
   One witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said motorists
deserted their vehicles and sought refuge in orange and banana
groves as the Israeli warplanes roared overhead.
   He said air raid sirens wailed in Sidon, the provincial capital
of south Lebanon, during the attack. Shopkeepers lowered their
shutters and several people deserted businesses and took cover in
basements and bomb shelters.
   It was the 12th Israeli air attack in Lebanon this year. By
police count, 62 people were killed and 81 wounded in the previous
11 raids.

   Iran's commander-in-chief said today his
country would not initiate any more military actions against Iraq,
but told soldiers to maintain their vigil against possible enemy
attacks.
   ``The armed forces should not, from today, be the initiators of
any kind of military and armed moves,'' said Hashemi Rafsanjani,
acting commander of the Iranian forces and also speaker of
Parliament.
   ``But just like always, (Iran) will be ready to give an
appropriate response to the mischiefs of the enemy,'' he said in a
statement broadcast on official Tehran radio.
   Only at 7 a.m. today, by way of Tehran Radio, did most Iranians
learn a cease-fire is to take effect Aug. 20 in their 8-year-old
war with Iraq. The announcement Monday at the United Nations in New
York came too late for the main morning newspaper, Jomhuri Islami.
   Iranians greeted the announcement with a sense of relief mixed
with skepticism that it will mean lasting peace.
   ``I heard it on the BBC (British Broadcasting Corp.) much
earlier,'' said a middle-aged man who declined to give his name.
``Sure, it's good, but I hope that there will not be years of
discussions like the talks that have been going on for so many
years about peace between the Arabs and Israel.''
   ``Hopefully it means peace,'' said a hotel employee in the Laleh
Hotel. ``But celebrating? After so many martyrs?''
   A man who introduced himself as a telephone operator was smiling
broadly. ``I just learned it 10 minutes ago. Sure, I will celebrate
tonight with my family. I will have a bottle of Coke. You know,
there is no drinking in our country.''
   A driver who said he formerly held a well-paid job in
construction told a visitor: ``My son, Romin, has sent a message
that he is coming home in four weeks now that the fighting ends. He
has been in the army for two years and eight months. Luckily he has
not been wounded. The place where is he is now is pretty quiet.''
   A 25-year-old named Fahrad said he was excused from military
service because of injuries he suffered in a car accident while
studying petrochemical engineering in Los Angeles.
   ``Many of my generation are dead,'' he said. ``In a way I was
lucky to have been in that accident.''
   A Western diplomat said expectations had been running high among
Tehran residents, but ``they will be disappointed, normalization
will take much time.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   European diplomatic sources, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said both sides seemed interested in restoring relations
but that process would take some time. ``There is a lot of
emotional debris to be cleared away on both sides,'' one analyst
said.
   An Associated Press reporter requested permission to visit
front-line troops preparing for the truce, but a Ministry of
Islamic Guidance official said it was not possible.
   A request to visit Tehran's war cemetery brought the same answer.
   An editorial in the English-language Tehran Times pointed to the
issues that have to be solved in direct talks that begin in Geneva
Aug. 25 before the neighbors can have comprehensive peace.
   ``What follows is really going to be crucial,'' the editorial
said. ``All negotiations now intended to be held under the aegis of
the U.N. secretary-general will undoubtedly have to take the
Algiers Accord as a reference point.''
   The Algiers Accord, which Iran and Iraq signed in 1975, was an
attempt to settle outstanding border disputes, especially over
access to the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. The delta of the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers is Iraq's only outlet to the sea and the accords
set the border in the middle of the waterway.
   ``It has to be remembered that the Iraqi leader (President
Saddam Hussein) did not have the slightest hesitation in tearing up
this agreement quite openly in a fit of pique at the inception of
the war,'' the newspaper said.

   Israeli troops shot and killed a 14-year-old
Palestinian and wounded eight other Arabs today, hospital officials
said. Israeli warplanes destroyed a radio station in Lebanon that
reportedly broadcast orders to the occupied territories.
   The latest fatality brought the Palestinian death toll to 238 in
the uprising in the occupied territories, now in its ninth month.
Four Israelis have been killed.
   In Israel's 12th air raid on southern Lebanon this year, a
military spokesman said the air force destroyed a PLO-run radio
station and an ammunition storehouse in southern Lebanon. Police in
Lebanon said three guerrillas were killed and 12 wounded in the
attack near Sidon.
   Commercial life was at a standstill today in Arab east Jerusalem
and at least eight cities in the occupied lands in observance of a
general strike called by pro-Palestine Liberation Organization
underground leaders.
   Arab merchants shuttered their shops and many of the 110,000 who
work in Israel stayed home from their jobs, Arab news reports and
witnesses said. Buses and taxis also stayed off roads, most of
which were deserted or blocked by protesters burning tires,
witnesses said.
   In the West Bank, Hussein Swei, 14, was fatally shot in the head
during a clash today between soldiers and dozens of Arab youths who
hurled stones, according to a spokesman at a U.N. clinic in
Qalqilya.
   The army said it was investigating the death, adding that a
curfew was imposed on the town after disturbances. The West Bank
town of Tulkarem also was placed under curfew.
   Hospital officials reported eight people wounded today. But a
military spokesman said the army could immediately confirm only two
Arabs shot in the Gaza Strip city of Khan Yunis.
   In the Gaza Strip today, an 18-year-old man from the Mugazi
refugee camp was rushed to Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City after
soldiers shot him in the chest during a clash, hospital officials
said.
   Two other Arab protesters were shot in the legs during the same
incident, the officials added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Soldiers also wounded three other Gazans in the town of Khan
Yunis during a protest that began when Arab activists tried to
prevent other Palestinians from heading to jobs in Israel, hospital
officials said. The army confirmed two of the wounded.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, soldiers fired at protesters
who hurled stones at the city hall building and blocked a road with
burning tires, wounding two, according to officials at a local
clinic.
   The army confirmed that soldiers fired live ammunition to quell
a protest in Hebron, but said it had no reports of injuries.

<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis today praised the
Reagan administration as ``growing'' but accused Vice President
George Bush of avoiding public stances on major foreign policy
issues.
   ``I don't think Bush's positions are clear on much of
anything,'' Dukakis declared.
   He asserted that President Reagan has moved closer to Dukakis'
own positions on crucial issues such as relations with the Soviet
Union while Bush has not. Dukakis cited the Persian Gulf, the
regional conflict in Southern Africa and the strategic arms
reduction talks.
   ``It's an administration that's growing. ... Frankly they're
coming a lot closer to where I am'' on such issues, Dukakis said.
   ``The INF (intermediate nuclear forces) treaty and Reagan's
approach to the summit demonstrate a willingness on his part to
explore closer relations with the Soviet Union. It's to his credit.
   ``Here's an administration that five years ago was talking `evil
empire,''' he said, referring to the words Reagan once used to
describe the Soviets, ``and now the president is walking arm-in-arm
with Gorbachev in Red Square.''
   Dukakis made the comments to reporters aboard his chartered
campaign jet as he flew to Cincinnati, where he was participating
in the final day of meetings of the National Governors'
Association. The Democratic presidential nominee is in his third
term as governor of Massachusetts.
   While Dukakis offered some praise for Reagan on foreign-policy
issues, he leveled a new blast at Bush, the vice president and
expected GOP presidential nominee on those same issues. He said
Bush's foreign-policy positions were unclear on all but ``this
endless fiasco in Central America,'' where Bush supports aid to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua and Dukakis opposes it.
   ``I don't know. Do you know where he stands?'' Dukakis said to
reporters. ``I don't think anybody knows where he is on these
things. ... The only thing he's done is to express some doubt on
U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   Dukakis attended to his governor's office duties Monday. But at
a Statehouse news conference, he faced repeated questioning about
Bush's renewed assault in which the vice president described him as
a ``stealth candidate'' who has ignored issues and concealed his
liberalism.
   ``I think the way I'm going to win the presidency is not by
responding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front of
Mr. Bush,'' Dukakis said. ``It's going to be by defining myself, my
party, my values, this country, its future, and the kind of society
I think all Americans want.''
   But pressed by reporters, Dukakis offered a response anyway.
   ``George Bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in
the history of American politics, and I think one of the reasons
for it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative
campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis, who has enjoyed big leads in recent polls, said voters
were looking for positive expressions of what a candidate planned
to do as president _ and suggested Bush has not been doing that.
   ``I don't think they're interested in a daily diet of this kind
of thing, and it's one of the reasons, at least at this point, the
Republican campaign seems to be in trouble,'' he said.
   Dukakis planned to campaign in Northeastern states Thursday and
Friday before spending the weekend vacationing on Cape Cod with his
wife Kitty.
   The campaign was preparing for next week's Republican National
Convention in New Orleans, where Dukakis is expected to be the
object of criticism and derision. Dukakis aides were suggesting
they expected to see much of Dukakis' double-digit lead over Bush
in recent polls evaporate in the week of Republican exposure.
   But Dukakis, following the lead of Bush, planned to head out on
a four-day campaign swing nex week beginning Wednesday, the third
day of the GOP convention. Bush broke with the tradition of not
campaigning during the rival's convention week by venturing out
during the Democratic convention three weeks ago.
   At his news conference, Dukakis recalled an 8-year-old blast
that Bush leveled at Ronald Reagan, before Bush joined Reagan on
the 1980 GOP ticket, as the governor's response to Bush's charge he
lacked foreign policy experience.
   ``He made the same comment about the Republican candidate for
the presidency in 1980, and he's now trying to succeed him. So what
can I say?'' Dukakis said.
   His aides distributed copies of a 1980 newspaper story that
quoted Bush as saying of Reagan: ``We cannot take a chance on
another president who has absolutely no experience in foreign
affairs.''

<TEXT>
   Dozens of firefighters doused a magnesium
fire early today at a sprawling industrial plant near the site of a
deadly rocket fuel blast that shook this community three months
ago, authorities said.
   The fire at the Titanium Metals Corp. was reported at 1:50 a.m.
and was under control by 2:40 a.m.
   No injuries were reported in the fire that caused an estimated
$15,000 damage, dispatcher Melanie Dobosh said. The fire erupted
after two ingots of magnesium apparently were placed too close
together, but the exact cause of the blaze is still under
investigation, she said.
   ``The magnesium melted and got into water'' in a drain, Ms.
Dobosh said. The reaction of the magnesium and the water may have
caused some small explosions, she added.
   A Clark County fire official said 12 units were sent to the
plant. Also sent was a team that specializes in fires involving
hazardous materials.
   The plant covers several blocks, dates to World War II and is
located about 20 miles southeast of Las Vegas.
   Henderson residents are still cleaning up from the May 4
explosion at the Pacific Engineering and Production Co. plant, just
three miles from the Titanium facility.
   That explosion, which killed two people and injured 326,
occurred when a series of fires touched off an explosion of
ammonium perchlorate, a critical oxidizer used in rocket fuel for
the space shuttle and various military rockets.

<TEXT>
   The Princess of York, newborn daughter of the Duke
and Duchess of York, is fifth in line the British throne now
occupied by her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   The baby girl born Monday night is far enough away from the
ancient seat not to have to train seriously for it as her Uncle
Charles, the first in line, did.
   Charles' 6-year-old son, Prince William of Wales, is destined to
be king after his father and will no doubt have to study for the
role more diligently than younger brother Prince Harry, almost 4,
the third in line.
   The baby's father, 28-year-old Prince Andrew, the Duke of York
and second son of the queen, is fourth in line as long as Charles
and his wife, Diana, have no other children to push Andrew further
down the list.
   The baby princess is officially Her Royal Highness Princess of
York.
   Her place in the line will change if her parents have a son, who
would be placed ahead of her, or if the Prince and Princess of
Wales have a daughter or another son.
   The new York baby pushes Prince Edward, 24, the queen's third
son, back to sixth place, and 37-year-old Anne _ her only daughter
and second-eldest child, back to seventh place.
   Anne's children _ Peter Phillips, 10, and Zara Phillips, 7 _ are
eighth and ninth in line. They are not a prince and princess, nor
are they designated royal highnesses, because Anne's husband,
equestrian champion Mark Phillips, has no royal title.
   The queen's 57-year-old sister, Princess Margaret, the Countess
of Snowdon, is 10th in line followed by her children, Viscount
Linley, 26, and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, 24, in 11th and 12th
place.
   The order of succession then shifts to the queen's cousins: the
Duke of Gloucester and his three children, the Duke of Kent and two
of his three children, and the two children of his brother Prince
Michael of Kent, who lost his own place by marrying a Roman
Catholic. The Duke of Kent's eldest son also lost his place in the
line of succession because he married a Catholic.
   The Kent brothers' sister, Princess Alexandra and her two
children are next.

   Twenty Soviet officials today inspected
a cruise missile base and repair shop under the superpower treaty
to remove medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe.
   The Soviet inspectors, led by Viacheslav S. Lyebedev, arrived
Monday at Abelag airport in Brussels on a Tupolev-134 of the Soviet
airline Aeroflot. They were welcomed by U.S. military and Belgian
officials.
   The Soviets, divided into two teams, were driven this morning to
Florennes air base, 40 miles south of Brussels, and a repair
factory in Gosselies, 10 miles north of the base.
   In Florennes, which houses the 485th U.S. Tactical Missile Wing,
the United States has deployed 20 cruise missiles since 1985,
including four spares. According to the latest figures, there were
55 missiles at the Gosselies repair plant, which belongs to Sabca,
a Belgian aviation company servicing U.S. cruise missiles.
   Under the treaty, the inspectors may spend up to 24 hours at
each site, with a possible eight-hour extension.
   The inspections are part of the Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces treaty, under which the United States and the Soviet Uhion
are to destroy within three years all medium-range nuclear missiles
with ranges of between 300 and 3,400 miles. The treaty gives each
party on-site inspection rights for 13 years.
   Under a 1979 NATO agreement, 572 cruise and Pershing 2 missiles
were to be deployed in five European nations.
   Soviet inspectors have visited U.S. missile sites and related
installations in Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and the
United States. Soviet inspectors have not yet viewed U.S. nuclear
missiles in Italy.
   U.S. inspectors have visited nuclear sites in the Soviet Union,
East Germany and Czechoslovakia.

<HEAD>300 Evacuated After Train Derailment Spills Flammable Chemical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three hundred residents of this tiny,
northeast Georgia community were forced to spend the night away
from home after chemical tankers fractured in a train derailment
spilled an industrial solvent.
   About 20 people were treated briefly at a hospital Monday after
they inhaled the slightly toxic fumes from the spilled solvent, a
highly flammable liquid called xylene that is used in aviation fuel
and as a solvent for resins, enamels and lacquers.
   An estimated 61 cars in a 95-car CSX freight train derailed at
about 1:30 p.m. Monday near the track's intersection with Georgia
72 in Middleton, a rural community four miles southeast of Elberton.
   Seven of the derailed cars were carrying hazardous materials and
at least three of those cars were leaking, said CSX Transportation
Inc. spokesman Ripley Watson.
   The damaged tankers were spilling their contents into a cow
pasture, said Elbert County Sheriff's Lt. Charles Dooley.
   Emergency personnel evacuated about 300 residents within about
two miles of the derailment, Dooley said. The evacuees were brought
to Elberton Civic Center where volunteers helped them find shelter
at local motels or at the homes of family and friends in the area.
   Authorities built a dike, using booms supplied by the Coast
Guard, to keep the pool of liquid xylene from flowing into nearby
Beaver Dam Creek, which forms the headwaters for Lake Russell, said
Lucy Justus, spokeswoman for the state Environmental Protection
Division.
   The liquid probably would be allowed to soak into the dirt and
the contaminated soil would be dug up and removed to a hazardous
waste landfill, she said.
   Watson said railroad workers expected to clear the tracks by
Thursday.
   The 95-car train, which was headed to Hamlet, N.C., from
Atlanta, also carried coal, pulpboard, lumber, soybean meal and a
number of truck trailers, Watson said.
   He said the train was going about 35 mph when it derailed. There
was no immediate indication of what caused the derailment.

<HEAD>Sudan's Prime Minister Declares State of Emergency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sudan's prime minister has declared a
nationwide state of emergency to cope with the country's worst
floods in 42 years, which have left more than 1 million Sudanese
homeless, Cairo newspapers said today.
   Sudan's capital, Khartoum, was almost completely paralyzed for
the third straight day from power and water supply cutoffs caused
by floods that followed torrential rains last week, the leading
state-owned Al-Ahram said.
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi announced on state television
Monday night that a six-month state of emergency was in effect to
help his government cope with the destruction.
   In Nairobi, Kenya, Ambassador Omer el-Sheikh of Sudan told The
Associated Press that millions of people have been stranded by
floods in eastern Sudan.
   El-Sheikh said more than 10,000 houses were destroyed in
Khartoum alone _ double the official figure given in the capital
Sunday _ and that he expected the number to increase.
   In London, a spokesman for the Foreign Office who spoke on
condition of anonymity said he had received reports of 11 dead,
some 100 injured and 1.5 million people left homeless. He said he
had no independent confirmation of the figures.
   Al-Ahram and Al-Gomhouria, another Egyptian state-owned
newspaper, said at least 11 people died, some electrocuted by
smashed power cables falling into flood waters.
   On Sunday, the Sudanese government declared Khartoum and three
other cities disaster areas and appealed for international help.
   The newspapers said that in Khartoum, the public transport
system collapsed, universities and schools were shut and some of
the capital's nearly 4 million inhabitants faced starvation after
bakeries closed and food supplies dwindled.
   The state-of-emergency decree enables the government to ban
strikes and demonstrations, make arrests without warrants, tap
private telephones and impose press censorship.
   A one-year state of emergency decreed in Sudan last year ended
only two weeks ago. It had been declared to deal with the effects
of the war against rebels in the south and the deteriorating
economy.
   Egypt responded to Sudan's appeal for help, sending 10 C-130
military transport planes carrying tents, medical supplies and food.
   In Brussels, Belgium, the European Economic Community said today
it had approved $712,000 in emergency aid. The money will provide
tents, blankets and other emergency equipment and will allow
doctors to fly to the African nation.
   Foreign Minister Hussein Abu-Saleh said that in addition to
Khartoum, the eastern cities of Kassala and Showak and the northern
city of el-Damer were declared disaster areas because of floods
triggered by continuous, heavy rainfall Thursday and Friday.
   He said entire villages had been isolated by flood waters.
   Finance Minister Omar Nour el-Dayem said in reports carried
Monday by Egypt's state-owned Middle East News Agency that about 1
million people were homeless after their houses were washed away.
   Sudan, along with most of central Africa, had been suffering
from several years of drought. A 5-year-old civil war in southern
Sudan has contributed to widespread famine since 1985, forcing
hundreds of thousands of people to trek north to Khartoum and
southeast into neighboring Ethiopia.

<TEXT>
   Prince Andrew arrived at a London hospital today
with a bouquet of red roses to visit his wife, Sarah, and their
newborn daughter as delighted Britons celebrated the princess'
birth on an especially lucky day.
   Champagne corks popped, bells rang and cameras flashed outside
Portland Hospital in central London with the announcement Monday
night of the birth of a 6-pound, 12-ounce girl to Andrew, the Duke
of York, and his red-haired duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in Hyde Park
and at Tower Green near the Tower of London this afternoon
celebrating the royal birth.
   The Princess of York, who has not yet been named, is their first
child and the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Jane Makim, the duchess' elder sister who lives in Australia,
told British reporters that her mother, Susan Barrantes, who was at
the hospital for the birth, had telephoned to say the baby was very
alert, had elegant hands and ``a petite little face ... just fit
for a princess.
   ``My mother said the baby is beautiful. Just a nice weight and
everything. Not much hair but very pretty,'' Mrs. Makim said.
   Andrew, sporting a yellow rose in the lapel of his dark blue
suit, smiled and waved to a large crowd of journalists and several
dozen well-wishers before going inside the American-owned Portland
Hospital.
   Only 24 hours earlier, he had looked somber and anxious as he
drove his 28-year-old wife to the hospital from the country home
west of London which they are renting from King Hussein of Jordan.
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, the duchess' obstetrician, was also at the
hospital today. He led a team of four doctors in the delivery room.
   Hundreds of people on their way to work this morning stopped off
at Buckingham Palace to see the brief notice posted on the gates
announcing the baby's birth.
   Polish student Arek Ilnicki went straight there after arriving
in London. ``I think the English are a bit mad about the baby. But
it's good.''
   Andrew, the 28-year-old second son of the monarch and a Royal
Navy lieutenant, flew to London on Sunday from Singapore where he
is on sea duty on HMS Edinburgh. News of the birth was announced to
the ship's crew and the prince's fellow officers immediately
toasted to the health of the baby and parents.
   The Buckingham Palace statement announcing the birth said the
Duchess of York was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m..''
   The statement said the delivery was ``a normal birth'' and
`there were no complications.'' Neither the palace nor the doctors
would say whether the birth had been induced, as newspapers had
speculated.
   Andrew was present at his daughter's birth, the palace said.
British press reports said the prince, an accomplished amateur
photographer, took the first photos of his daughter.
   There was much speculation over the baby's name, with Elizabeth
and Victoria as favorites. Early in his wife's pregnancy Andrew had
been quoted as saying the baby would be called Annabel.
   Whatever the choice, the baby will be Her Royal Highness,
Princess (name) of York. She is fifth in line to the throne behind
Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, Charles' two children
Prince William and Prince Harry, and Andrew himself. The queen's
two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara Phillips, are the children
of her only daughter, Anne.
   The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 on the eighth day of the
eighth month of the century's 88th year is being taken by
well-wishers as a sign of great good fortune. The day is considered
highly auspicious by Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for
eight is similar to that for prosperity.
   The Times of London headline said: ``At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A Safe
and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun said: ``Fergie's first
baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.''
   A message of congratulation from Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her husband, Denis, who are visiting Bangkok, read:
``It is wonderful news and your happiness will be shared by the
whole nation.''
   It was not known how soon the queen and her husband, Prince
Philip, would see the baby. The queen has public engagements in
Scotland today and is cruising off the Scottish coast in the royal
yacht Britannia.
   The Queen Mother Elizabeth is on vacation in Scotland.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, and their sons go to the
Spanish island of Majorca this week for a vacation with the Spanish
royal family.

   Democratic presidential nominee Michael
Dukakis joined fellow governors today as they were told the next
president ``will have a limited amount of time to make the tough
choices'' needed to deal with the federal budget deficit.
   Dukakis took his seat at a corner of the square table at which
the nation's governors sat for the closing session of the 80th
annual meeting of the National Governors' Association.
   The governors' first order of business at the session was to
hear from former Reagan administration Cabinet official Drew Lewis
and Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., co-chairmen of the National
Economic Commission, a panel established to recommend ways to deal
with the deficit.
   ``That commission is not going to come up with any magic
answers, but it can provide important political cover for the next
president,'' said Panetta.
   The California congressman said the next president would face
difficult choices on such questions as the level of defense
spending, whether to cut programs that include automatic benefit
increases, and whether to ask for a tax increase.
   Dukakis said nothing during that opening discussion.
   Governor of Massachusetts for 10 years, Dukakis attended the
meeting the day after the governors warmly applauded President
Reagan when he told them that during his two terms in the White
House the states had gained far more flexibility and power to deal
with domestic problems.
   No longer just one of 50 state governors seated around the
conference table, Dukakis also was meeting with Democratic
governors for a closed session on strategy for his campaign against
Republican George Bush.
   ``He will ask the governors to speak out on his behalf,'' said
campaign spokesman Leslie Dach, who added that Dukakis believes his
record as a governor is one of his greatest strengths.
   Before Reagan spoke to the governors Monday, he stopped at a
local plant and told workers that ``some people'' were campaigning
on the idea that ``it's time for a change, take a chance on us.''
   But ``you can't unplug our pro-growth economic policies and
expect things to stay the same,'' he said.
   In that speech and in his later talk to the governors, Reagan
cited the number of jobs created during his tenure, as well as
lower unemployment in general and reduced taxes.
   Reagan's theme was picked up by Gov. George Deukmejian of
California, who said Vice President Bush would carry the nation's
largest state despite current polls there giving Dukakis a
double-digit lead over Bush.
   ``Why would the people want to risk a change in going to a total
unknown person, an unknown administration?'' asked Deukmejian.
   As governor of a state with 47 electoral votes, nearly one-fifth
of the 270 needed for election, Deukmejian was mentioned often as a
potential running mate for Bush. But the governor took himself out
of contention for that spot in a letter last week to the vice
president.
   Turning to another likely GOP campaign theme, Deukmejian said
that after the Democratic convention in Atlanta last month, ``the
Democratic Party has been Jacksonized,'' a reference to the
prominent role given to Jesse Jackson.
   Deukmejian predicted Jackson would ``want to continue to be in
the limelight'' and that ``Governor Dukakis is going to have his
hands full with Mr. Jackson between now and Election Day.''
   But while Deukmejian described Dukakis as unknown, fellow
Republican Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey said Bush suffers from
the same problem.
   ``One thing our polls show is that people don't know what he
(Bush) has done before becoming vice president and people are
confused about his views on the issues,'' said Kean, a supporter of
Bush and keynote speaker at the Republican convention next week.
   Dach said that in the course of the long presidential campaign,
people have gotten to know Dukakis and polls show they are inclined
to support him.
   By contrast, said Dach, the polls show that ``people know George
Bush and they don't like him.''

   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity has
announced the establishment of the Commercial Space Advisory
Committee to recommend ways to increase U.S. business presence in
space ventures and activities.
   ``The U.S. needs to forge a stronger link between our vast
science and technology resources and U.S. corporations and
entrepreneurs ... to ensure an economic environment where U.S.
space commerce can thrive,'' Verity said in a statement Monday.
   The 15-member panel, composed of representatives from industry,
government and higher education, is scheduled to make
recommendations to the administration by the end of October, when
its authorization expires.
   All but two of the committee members represent corporations not
traditionally associated with space ventures. Ed Hood, vice
president of General Electric Co., will serve as chairman of the
group which also includes governors Bob Martinez of Florida and
John D. Waihee of Hawaii.

   Mohammed Ali Hamadi admitted in
court today to being one of four men who hijacked a TWA jetliner to
Beirut in 1985, but denied killing a U.S. Navy diver during the
ordeal.
   ``I took part in the hijacking,'' the Lebanese Shiite Moslem
said, reading from a statement in the heavily guarded courtroom.
   ``If this act which I committed is against the law, then it is a
result of illegal conduct on the part of Israel,'' Hamadi, speaking
in Arabic, said through an interpreter.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days after TWA
Flight 847 was hijacked on an Athens-to-Rome flight. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was beaten and fatally shot and his body thrown onto
a Beirut airport runway.
   Under West German law, Hamadi still can be convicted of murder
even if he did not actually pull the trigger. He faces a maximum of
life in prison.
   Hamadi, on trial for air piracy and murder, said he hijacked a
U.S. aircraft ``because the United States is the greatest ally and
supporter of Israel.''
   Clean-shave and waring an open-neck cream-colored shirt, Hamadi
read calmly and clearly from the statement.
   He said the goal of the June 1985 hijacking was to gain freedom
for Shiite imprisoned in Israel.
   ``The decision to hijack the plane came after everything else
failed,'' Hamadi said in 45-minute presentation. ``There was no
other way to free the prisoners other than the means chosen.''
   Shortly after the June 1985 hijacking ended, Israel released
approximately 700 Lebanese.
   In reflecting on the hijacking, Hamadi told the court: ``I am
not ready to do something like that again.''
   ``As I took part in the action, that happened out of the belief
that there was no other way to get the release of those imprisoned.
Now, I'm of the opinion that that's not the case.''
   The trial, which started in July, was adjourned until Sept. 6,
when members of the crew of the TWA plane were to begin testifying.
   Until today, the only testimony that Hamadi was involved in the
hijacking came from two witnesses who testified that Hamadi's older
brother Abbas had told them as much.
   Hamadi told the court that one of the three alleged hijackers
still at large, Hassan Izz-al-Din, was in charge of the hijacking
and had shot Stethem.
   ``The pistol was in his (Izz-al-Din's) hand,'' Hamadi said. ``I
didn't use it. Our orders were not to harm anyone, but I couldn't
convince him not to shoot.''
   Stethem's parents, Richard and Patricia Stethem of Waldorf, Md.,
were in the courtroom as Hamadi spoke.
   When Hamadi finished, Chief Judge Heiner Mueckenberger said the
testimony ``was surprising for everybody. It marks a certain turn
in the trial.
   ``It was an intelligent presentation of your point of view,'' he
added, saying the court would have to reconsider the future course
of the trial.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987 when
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.
   The United States sought his extradition, but West Germany
turned down the request after two West German businessmen were
abducted in Beirut.
   Abbas Hamadi was sentenced to 13 years in prison after he was
convicted by a West German court in April of masterminding the
kidnappings in an attempt to force West Germany to free Mohammed.
   One of the abducted men, Alfred Schmidt, was released in
September 1987. The other, Rudolf Cordes, remains a hostage and is
believed held by Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian Shiite group in Lebanon.
   A third Hamadi brother, Abdul-Hadi, is Hezbollah's security
chief in Beirut. Mohammed Hamadi has denied being a member of
Hezbollah.

<TEXT>
   An exterminating company has been convicted
of violating federal pesticide law for failing to monitor the
fumigation of a house in which two people later died.
   Atlanta-based Orkin Exterminating Co. Inc. could be fined up to
$500,000.
   At a brief hearing Monday, U.S. District Judge James C. Turk
convicted the company of one count of violating federal pesticide
law but agreed to throw out four other charges alleging Orkin had
improperly fumigated the Galax home of Hubert and Freida Watson on
Sept. 25, 1986.
   Orkin had faced fines totaling $1.7 million on all five counts.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Pierce said the maximum fine in the
single conviction, $100,000, could be raised to $500,000 if it can
be proved that the pesticide killed the couple.
   Turk set sentencing for Sept. 6 and ordered a pre-sentencing
report.
   ``Basically what I'm interested in in a pre-sentencing report is
any previous conviction for this type of behavior and the financial
condition of the company,'' the judge said.
   Orkin attorney Sam Wilson declined comment on the ruling.
   An indictment returned by a federal grand jury this spring
alleged the company did not follow labeled instructions on the
pesticide, Vikane, and allowed the Watsons to move back into their
home before it had been thoroughly ventilated.
   Orkin also was accused of removing warning signs before the home
was aired out and failing to test the home with appropriate
monitoring equipment to make sure it was safe.
   Watson, 73, died three days after the fumigation. Mrs. Watson,
65, died four days after her husband.
   Orkin and Dow Chemical Co., the marketer of Vikane, also are
named in a $2.5 million federal lawsuit filed by Signet Trust Co.
on behalf of Mrs. Watson's estate. The wrongful death suit is
pending, court officials said.

   Gunmen fired on security forces
before dawn today as gangs of IRA supporters took to the streets to
mark 17 years since authorities began jailing guerrilla suspects
without trial.
   Eight police officers were injured, none seriously, and 42
people were arrested, according to the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
the province's police force. Four injured civilians were still
hospitalized today but the exact number treated and released was
not known.
   Police said the gangs launched about 80 attacks on security
forces Monday night and early today in a constant barrage of
bullets, bombs, rocks and other missiles. Protesters hijacked cars,
erected barricades across streets and lighted dozens of bonfires.
   Security forces fired plastic bullets to break up the rioters,
including a crowd of several hundred throwing gasoline bombs at
police outside a bus station. On at least one occasion, police
opened fire with live ammunition.
   The violence was concentrated in the predominantly Catholic
western and northern areas of Belfast.
   Outside Belfast, there was less trouble although clashes were
reported in County Armagh and County Down. In Downpatrick, County
Down, a primary school was damaged by fire and there were three
arrests. In Antrim, two houses were set on fire, police siad.
   Britain abandoned internment in December 1975 after worldwide
criticism, but IRA supporters continue each year to mark the
anniversary of its introduction on Aug. 9, 1971.
   In separate attacks, shots were reported fired at a police
patrol and at a police station and a grenade was thrown at an army
barracks.
   A stolen car crashed through a security checkpoint, knocking
down a policeman, who was not seriously hurt. Security forces fired
at the fleeing car, which escaped.
   The violence followed the deaths of two Roman Catholics in
Belfast Monday in a suspected revenge slaying by Protestants for a
new spate of Irish Republican Army attacks.
   In the attack, gunmen firing from a car fatally shot a youth and
a beer deliveryman, both Catholics. The gunmen escaped and
abandoned their car in a Protestant district about two miles away,
police said.
   Police sources and moderate Catholic leaders blamed the attack
on Protestant extremists taking revenge for a series of IRA
bombings and shootings in Northern Ireland, Britain and West
Germany that left six dead and 37 injured last week.
   Police sources said the Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed
guerrilla group, is believed responsible. It was the first
Protestant extremist attack in more than a month.
   The killings took place as police chiefs and Protestant
political leaders met to try to devise new security measures
against the outlawed IRA.
   The mainly Catholic IRA wants to unite the predominantly
Protestant province with the Republic of Ireland.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission today
unanimously approved the sale of the Southern Pacific Railroad to
Rio Grande Industries, creating a 15,000-mile rail system that
covers 15 states from Portland, Ore., to New Orleans.
   Rio Grande Industries has agreed to buy the Southern Pacific
from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. for $1.2 billion.
   The ICC in a 4-0 vote said the merger of the Southern Pacific
and the Denver & Rio Grande Western railroads would have the best
competitive results and be in the public interest.
   The commission last year ordered the Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp. to divest itself of the Southern Pacific after the rejection
of that railroad's merger with the Santa Fe.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries,
but when permission for the sale was sought from the ICC, another
railroad company, Kansas City Southern Industries, objected and
sought to buy Southern Pacific as well.
   But the ICC in a series of votes today turned its back on the
Kansas City Southern proposal and approved the sale to Rio Grande
Industries instead.
   At a news conference, Philip Anschutz, chairman of Rio Grande
Industries, applauded the ICC decision and said the combined
railroads ``will operate under the banner of Southern Pacific.''
   He said that senior officers of the Southern Pacific will be
announced before the purchase is completed and that managers will
be drawn from the ranks of both railroads.
   The Southern Pacific also has extensive real estate holdings in
the West, but Anschutz said, ``We will be in the railroad business,
first and foremost.''
   The Southern Pacific operates up and down the West Coast and
along the southern tier of the country with tracks stretching from
Portland, Ore., through central California through El Paso, Texas,
and as far east as New Orleans. It also operates from St. Louis to
the Gulf Coast.
   The Denver & Rio Grande runs along a central corridor from
Ogden, Utah, to St. Louis.
   Kansas City Southern could challenge the ICC ruling in court but
the company's president and chief executive officer, Landon
Rowland, said no decision has been made on what the next step, if
any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything. ... I don't know what our
options are,'' Rowland told reporters after the ICC vote.

   Burmese troops today fired on thousands
of demonstrators calling for the overthrow of President Sein Lwin,
and a Western diplomat said he had reports of more than 100 people
killed. State-run radio said at least 36 people died.
   A U.S. official in Washington said witnesses reported seeing
demonstrators carrying bodies of dead protesters over their heads
as they marched through the streets of Rangoon, the Burmese capital.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said reports
from Rangoon put casualties in today's demonstrations in ``the
hundreds,'' but said it would take time for information to be
sorted out.
   A Rangoon-based Western diplomat said he had ``fairly credible''
reports of more than 100 people killed as students, monks and
others confronted soldiers who had been moved into the city since
martial law was declared last week.
   State-owned Rangoon radio said authorities clamped an 8
p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew on the capital and banned gatherings of more
than five people.
   The radio said five people were killed and 55 wounded in
Rangoon, while 31 people were killed and 37 wounded in the central
town of Sagaing. The Sagaing protest broke out as 5,000
demonstrators tried to seize the police station.
   The radio said 1,451 ``looters and disturbance makers'' had been
arrested. It was unclear whether the figure included more than 800
people the radio previously said had been arrested.
   The broadcast listed a total of 26 areas, not including Rangoon,
where demonstrations were held today. It also said schools
throughout the country, including elementary schools, were closed
indefinitely. All universities were ordered shut following riots
last June.
   Some foreign offices, including the U.S. Embassy, closed their
doors today and Burmese consulates in some Asian cities stopped
issuing entry visas to tourists.
   ``It was a game of cat and mouse. The army was chasing,'' said
James Cole, a 27-year-old Australian architect who arrived in
Bangkok today. He said he saw up to 600 soldiers, some armed with
machine guns, at Shwedagon Pagoda, a site of anti-government
protests.
   Cole said parts of the city were cordoned off with barricades
and roadblocks were manned by soldiers. On a drive from Mandalay to
Rangoon, he said he saw six armored cars and up to 20 trucks loaded
with troops heading for the capital.
   ``They appeared nervous but ready for some sort of trouble,'' he
said.
   The demonstrations are by far the largest show of
anti-government sentiment since democracy was toppled in the
Southeast Asian nation in 1962.
   ``This is a tragedy. Our reports say the crowds have been very
conciliatory (towards the security forces),'' one diplomat said
today. ``Things are going from bad to worse.''
   Radio Rangoon reported mass demonstrations Monday in areas
ranging from Moulmein on the southern coast to Taunggyi in the
mountainous area of the Shan States. It said security forces killed
four people and wounded 12 in Mandalay and the same number of
casualties were inflicted in Mergui on the southern coast during
``violent incidents.''
   Japan's Kyodo News Agency reported from Rangoon that 30,000
people took part in Monday's protests in the capital, while more
than 10,000 students, monks and others demonstrated in Mandalay,
Burma's second-largest city.
   Students have been at the forefront of protest against Sein
Lwin, whom they blame for ordering the suppression of
demonstrations in Rangoon last March and June in which more than
100 people were killed by unofficial count.
   Sein Lwin was named president and chairman of Burma's ruling
party last month and soon after ordered the arrests of the most
outspoken critic of the authoritarian government, former Brig. Gen.
Aung Gyi, other dissidents and Associated Press correspondent Sein
Win.
   Rangoon-based diplomats link government price increases,
hoarding of food and other economic hardships to the general
tension in the country. Burma's economy suffered greatly under the
isolationist policies of Ne Win. Inflation is soaring and the
country has a foreign debt of $4 billion.
   Over the past year, conditions have worsened and Burma _ with an
annual per capita income of less than $200. Since the fall, there
have been anti-government demonstrations in virtually every city
and town.
   In Bangkok and Hong Kong, Burmese consular officials said they
had been ordered by Rangoon to indefinitely stop issuing tourist
visas to Burma, but the consulate in Tokyo said it was continuing
to process them. Officials said businessmen could still apply for
special visas.
   In recent weeks, Burmese embassies around the world have tried
to screen out journalists applying under tourist visas. The
Associated Press has been unable to enter the country.

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 18 grafs to UPDATE with lightning death, new info

<TEXT>
   Fierce thunderstorms ranged from Michigan to Kansas today after
much of the central United States was belted by storms bringing
large hail, drenching rains and winds that blew out windows and
leveled trees and power poles.
   Lightning killed a teen-age girl and critically injured her
friend at a Racine, Wis., park.
   In the South, Tropical Storm Beryl moved across New Orleans
today, prompting the National Weather Service to alert 16 coastal
parishes for possibly heavy rains.
   Strong storms ripped through northeast Kansas and northern
Missouri early today but the intensity of many storms began to fade
in early morning.
   In southern Wisconsin, high winds toppled trees across Highway
24 at Muskego, while in Vernon, winds gusted to 60 mph. Streets in
Lake Geneva were flooded by the torrential rain, and at least one
funnel cloud was sighted.
   Strong thunderstorm winds also scattered trees at Roscoe and
Rockton, Ill., as well as in Plainview, Donahue and Walcott, Iowa.
Power poles fell in high winds at West Liberty, Iowa.
   In Kansas City, Mo., strong winds brought down trees and blew
out windows.
   Hershey, Neb., was blasted by winds up to 60 mph and hail the
size of golf balls.
   The storms also brought a deluge of rain. More than 2 inches
fell at Kearney, Mo., and Madrid, Kan.
   In Chicago, rain forced officials to cut short the Cubs' first
night baseball game at Wrigley Field.
   ``This is typical,'' said one disgruntled fan. ``It doesn't rain
all summer long, and then on the first night game ever, it has to
rain.''
   In Racine, witnesses told police that a lightning bolt hit a
tree at Lincoln Park, then apparently traveled through the ground
and struck the two girls Monday afternoon.
   Karla Kay Hedding, 17, died immediately, said Thomas Cloyd,
assistant Racine County medical examiner. Her friend, who was not
identified, was listed in critical condition at Milwaukee County
Medical Complex.
   As Beryl, the Atlantic hurricane season's second named storm,
moved over New Orleans, forecasters said its movement raised hopes
that it might dissipate.
   Earlier, several coastal communities were evacuated as the
storm, which has already forced thousands of oil workers from their
offshore rigs, intensified off the Louisiana-Mississippi Gulf Coast.
   At 8 a.m. EDT today, the Beryl's center was just northwest of
New Orleans at latitude 30.2 north and longitude 90.3 west. Highest
sustained winds were 50 mph.
   Warnings were in effect from Morgan City, La., to Pensacola, Fla.
   Thunderstorms spawned by Beryl poured heavy rain along the Gulf
Coast from southeast Louisiana to Mobile, Ala. Biloxi, Miss.,
received more than 3 inches of rain early today.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Florida and southern Georgia across southern Louisiana; numerous
thunderstorms from northwest Florida to western Louisiana from
Tropical Storm Beryl; scattered showers and thunderstorms through
lower Michigan, southeast Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois,
much of Missouri, Kansas, northern Vermont to northern Maine; and
fair weather throughout the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s over Upper Michigan,
northwest Washington and parts of the California coast; in the 90s
or higher from southern New England to Florida, from the Ohio
Valley across to the central Gulf of Mexico coast, over the lower
half of the Mississippi Valley, through eastern Montana, through
the central Pacific coast and the Great Basin, between 100 degrees
and 105 degrees over Oklahoma, central Texas and across the desert
Southwest; in the 80s through the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 92 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz..

   Ed Broadbent, leader of Canada's New Democratic
Party, escaped injury when his small charter plane crash-landed on
a runway in northern Quebec.
   The landing gear of the Merlin turboprop collapsed Monday when
the plane touched down at Rouyn-Noranda Airport, and both engines
were torn away as the aircraft slid on its left wing.
   Broadbent, 52, and six other people on board escaped injury.
   ``The pilot had two options _ he could have stayed down once the
landing gear went or he could have tried to climb again and I'm
pleased he didn't,'' Broadbent said.
   Broadbent's socialist party is the third largest party in
Canada, with 32 seats in Parliament. He was on a pre-election trip
at the time of the accident. Conservative Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney is expected to call a general election this fall. Recent
opinion polls show Broadbent is more popular than Mulroney or
Liberal Party leader John Turner.

   Medical debris like that plaguing
beaches in the Northeast has been found on a North Carolina beach
and police were investigating reports that more material washed up
today, police said.
   No beaches were closed.
   Used syringes and vials such as those used in blood tests were
found in a plastic trash bag that washed up Monday night at Indian
Beach, Indian Beach Police Chief John Stevens said today.
   ``It has blood vials, testing vials, and some used syringes in
it and other medical debris,'' Stevens said. ``I did not detect any
blood. I opened the top of the sack up to see what was in it. There
were no blood samples or anything .... I didn't see any needles. It
appeared the needles had been cut off.''
   Stevens said he was awaiting direction from Tom Hinton,
emergency management coordinator for Carteret County, about
possibly closing beaches.
   ``We don't foresee any problems at this time ...,'' Stevens said.
   Numerous beaches have been closed for varying periods this
summer along the coasts of New Jersey, New York's Long Island and
Connecticut because of medical waste and sewage.
   Because of the high tide, Stevens said he and the police chief
of nearby Pine Knoll Shores were unable to get onto the beach to
look at other materials found today.
   ``All we know is there's some stuff washed up and we don't know
what it contains,'' Stevens said.
   The discoveries are the latest in a series of reports of medical
debris found along North Carolina beaches in recent days.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis fired a return salvo at George Bush
today, grabbing a central attack theme from the Republican
nominee-to-be and charging ``I don't think Bush's positions are
clear on much of anything.''
   Bush has hit Dukakis in recent days with a barrage of criticism,
saying the Massachusetts governor is inexperienced in foreign
policy and waffles on the issues. On Monday, he set the tone for
next week's Republican National Convention, taking advantage of a
rare appearance for a nominee at platform hearings to light into
Dukakis.
   ``He's the stealth candidate,'' Bush said. ``While he can't
decide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead stealth policies
_ they can be neither seen nor heard.''
   Dukakis supports research and development for the supersecret
bomber but has not vowed to support deployment.
   As Bush got off one of his better lines, Sen. Phil Gramm of
Texas said he wouldn't stoop to using ``some cutesy-poo'' name to
attack Dukakis during his nominating speech for Bush.
   ``I'm not going to demean the office by trying to think up some
cute name that I can call him that somebody might laugh at,'' Gramm
said, referring to wisecracking speeches that Texans Ann Richards
and Jim Hightower made at the Democratic National Convention.
   Bush stayed away from direct attacks on Dukakis today, painting
himself instead as tough on crime and touting his opposition to the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``There are those, like the ACLU, whose first concerns are the
protection of the criminals' rights and the potential abuse of
power by police,'' Bush told a police group in Erie, Pa. ``My first
concerns are the protection of law-abiding citizens and the abuse
of our system of constitutional protections by thugs who can go and
hire smart lawyers and find the right judges to set them free.''
   And the Republican vice president said liberals in Congress just
duck the tough issue of drug enforcement: ``Congress is full of
rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to law
enforcement a lot of the liberals there go AWOL.''
   The Democratic nominee lashed back at Bush as he flew from
Boston to Cincinnati to join the final session of the National
Governors Association.
   Bush's foreign-policy positions were unclear, Dukakis said, with
the sole exception of ``this endless fiasco in Central America,''
where Bush supports aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and
Dukakis opposes it.
   ``I don't know. Do you know where he stands?'' Dukakis said to
reporters. ``I don't think anybody knows where he is on these
things. ... The only thing he's done is to express some doubt on
U.S.-Soviet relations....I don't think Bush's positions are clear
on much of anything.''
   Dukakis did offer some praise for Reagan administration
policies, saying relations with the Soviet Union have improved, for
example.
   ``It's an administration that's growing,'' he commented.
   On Monday in Cincinnati, the governors heard a farewell speech
from President Reagan, with the GOP incumbent staying away from the
campaign specifics but boasting of the accomplishments of his
administration.
   ``Our states, like our citizens, have known the blessings of the
longest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' Reagan said.
   In the convention city, politics took a back seat to the weather
as tropical storm Beryl pounded away on the region. The storm
stalled off the coast, with strong winds blowing heavy rain through
the city.
   Dukakis was weary of the constant pounding from Bush, whom he
leads by double-digit margins in the national polls on the fall
election, and he said the public is getting tired of it as well.
   ``I don't think they're interested in a daily diet of this kind
of thing and it's one of the reasons, at least at this point, the
Republican campaign seems to be in trouble,'' Dukakis said in
Boston.
   At first, the Massachusetts governor said he would not respond
to Bush.
   ``I think the way I'm going to win the presidency is not by
responding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front of
Mr. Bush,'' Dukakis said.
   Then he responded.
   ``George Bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded in
the history of American politics, and I think one of the reasons
for it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negative
campaign,'' Dukakis said.
   Bush, touring the Superdome where the party will bestow its
nomination next week, denied that he was engaging in negative
campaigning.
   ``No, no ... very positive,'' Bush said as he visited with
teen-agers painting signs for the convention. ``We've got to get
these differences in focus.''
   He also called for a party platform that will stand up well in
comparison with what he called the Democrats' ``document of
deceit.'' With the convention his, and no serious arguments within
the party, Bush was certain to get the platform he wants _ although
the party subcommittees took testimony into the night from more
than 200 witnesses.
   ``We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, a
statement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' Bush said.
   The one mystery about the four days of Republican meeting _
Bush's choice of a vice president _ stayed a mystery.
   ``Still working on it'' was Bush's comment Monday, sticking with
his promise to announce his decision on the last day of the
convention.
   Members of the party's Committee on Contests tried to resolve
challenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from Georgia. Bush
won the primary there, but supporters of television evangelist Pat
Robertson made a run at taking over the party machinery.
   Regardless who is seated, the delegates must vote for Bush.

   The bright lights of night baseball illuminated
Wrigley Field for the first time in 74 years, but the historic game
was cut short when the rain came and lightning bolts lit up the sky.
   ``I feel like we saw the beginning of history being made, but we
didn't get to see the end,'' lawyer Donald Kurasch said Monday
night, as the heavy rain halted the game in the bottom of the
fourth inning with the Chicago Cubs leading the Philadelphia
Phillies, 3-1.
   Two hours after 91-year-old Cubs fan Harry Grossman declared
``Let there be light!'' and threw the switch that turned on the
towering Wrigley Field lights, the clouds took over.
   The game at the last major-league ballpark with day-only games
was postponed two hours and 10 minutes later, delaying Wrigley's
first official night game until tonight's contest between the Cubs
and the New York Mets.
   Monday's rain was seen as symptomatic of the Cubs' seemingly
endless disappointments to its fans, like when the team blew
potential championships in 1984 and 1969.
   ``It's kind of like the fates are against them,'' said Mike
Quigley, a neighborhood activist who led the fight against night
games.
   Some made out anyway. Scalpers got up to $250 for tickets.
Rooftops with views of the field were rented out for as much as
$1,000.
   Fans with tickets to Monday night's game can exchange them for
any game for which tickets are available or get refunds, the Cubs
said. They won't be able to attend tonight's game; it's sold out.
   The day began with boundless optimism for Cubs fans.
   Throngs filled the Wrigleyville neighborhood early, many
chugging beer. An army of vendors hawked commemorative T-shirts for
up to $15 a piece.
   ``I think it's beautiful,'' said Paula Torres, 62 as she sat on
the stoop across from Wrigley's main entrance in 99-degree heat.
``It seems like everybody's in a good mood despite the heat. I
haven't seen a crabby face yet.''
   Some residents prepared for the worst, organizing patrols
against drunkeness and vandalism.
   ``I never minded the day games because it's daylight and you can
see what the people are doing, but I mind the night games,'' said
Shirley Habbe, 56, who has lived less than a block from Wrigley's
main entrance for 20 years.
   As daylight faded, parts of the neighborhood began resembling a
party.
   On the roof of one apartment building across from Wrigley's
right-field wall, 45 peopled attended a catered party where the
women wore cocktail dresses and the men black ties, tuxedo tops and
Hawaiian shorts.
   About 250 people, many clutching beer cans, gathered behind the
left-field wall to watch the lights being turned on and try to
catch a home run ball.
   In their midst, stood Randy Murphy, who drove 300 miles to
Chicago from Lovington in central Illinois, even though he was not
among the sellout crowd of 39,000 with tickets.
   ``We just couldn't pass this up. This is just incredible. It's a
great big party. You can just go from bar to bar to bar,'' he said.
   Police were prepared with a force of 172 officers, including
mounted patrols and canine units, but few problems materialized.
   Authorities reported at least five arrests, including three for
ticket scalping and two vendor violations. And city officials said
more than 60 illegally parked cars were towed by the start of the
game.
   Ivy-covered Wrigley, built in 1914, held on to its daytime-only
baseball tradition decades longer than any other ballpark in the
nation. The last team to light up _ the Detroit Tigers _ did it 40
years ago.
   City Council voted in February to lift the ban on lights despite
fierce opposition from a neighborhood group known as CUBS _
Citizens United for Baseball in the Sunshine.
   The team has eight night games for this season and 18 for every
year until 2002.
   But Quigley, vice-president of the opposing neighborhood group,
vowed Monday night that Wrigleyville's residents won't give up
their fight, begun in 1981 when the Tribune Co. bought the Cubs and
announced its plans to erect lights.
   If the group fails to halt night games or at least win a curfew
and other restrictions, Quigley predicted, the Wrigleyville
precinct would vote the area dry of alcohol in the spring 1989
municipal election.
   ``I think it would be a real disservice, especially watching
this carnival atmosphere, to give up the fight,'' Quigley said.

   A woman and her three sons were convicted of
murder for the slayings of three police officers in a shootout and
motel siege stemming from a bad-check warrant.
   A Wayne County Circuit Court jury deliberated for 17 hours over
four days before returning the verdicts Monday. Alberta Easter and
her sons William Lemons, 44, Roy Lemons, 48, and George Lemons, 46,
all were found guilty of three counts of first-degree murder.
   They were charged in the deaths of Inkster Sgt. Ira Parker, 41,
and Officers Daniel Dubiel, 36, and Clay Hoover, 24, whose
bullet-riddled bodies lay in a motel room while the family held
police at bay for 10 hours.
   The sons also were found guilty of numerous felony firearms and
felonious assault charges.
   Attorneys for the defendants said they would appeal the verdicts.
   ``I think their minds were made up early, and they weren't able
to resist the pressure to convict,'' said Gerald Evelyn, Easter's
attorney. ``I'm disappointed. It's a very tough case to resist the
pressure to do a lot of things the jury did.''
   The defendants displayed no emotions publicly while families and
friends of the slain officers hugged two Wayne County assistant
prosecutors after the verdict was announced.
   ``The survivors and loved ones reminded me every day of what was
at stake,'' Assistant Prosecutor Douglas Baker said.
   The officers had been trying to serve a bad check warrant on
Easter and one of the Lemons when they were shot.
   Easter had claimed both that the officers shot each other while
exchanging gunfire with the family inside the room, and that they
were shot during exchanges between the family and other officers
outside.
   Autopsy reports said the officers were killed within minutes of
entering the motel room. Hoover and Dubiel were shot 29 times each,
one report said.
   Police and the Easter family exchanged gunfire during the night
of July 9, 1987, before the family gave up early the next day. They
have been jailed since.
   Judge Richard Hathaway scheduled sentencing for Sept. 13. The
murder convictions carry mandatory life prison terms.

   The refusal of three alleged victims to
testify in a pre-school molestation trial could force the dismissal
of 27 charges, prosecutors said. The defense, however, said the
case is collapsing of its own weakness.
   The children balked because they are traumatized and want to
avoid reviving painful memories, Deputy District Attorney Lael
Rubin said outside court following Monday's surprise announcement.
   Two boys have continuing nightmares and a girl has lost her
memory of all events up to a year ago _ a sign of ``massive
depression,'' Ms. Rubin said. The children were students at the
McMartin Pre-School.
   ``While we have a responsibility to present all of the evidence,
we also have a responsiblity not to increase trauma to kids,'' she
said.
   Without the testimony, trying to prove the allegations against
Raymond Buckey, 30, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 61,
would be an ``extraordinarily difficult thing to do,'' Ms. Rubin
said.
   The Buckeys are charged with 99 molestions and one joint count
of conspiracy, although 82 of the counts name only Buckey. Thirty
charges rest on the testimony of the three children who refused to
testify and on another child who declined to take the stand last
month.
   Thus, nearly a third of the remaining charges could be dropped
if the judge finds insufficient evidence to support them.
   The elimination of some witnesses also means the yearlong trial
_ part of a 5-year-old case _ could end within a month, Ms. Rubin
said.
   Following the disclosure, the prosecution called to the witness
stand Kee MacFarlane, the social worker whose interviews with
hundreds of children in the case became a point of controversy in
pretrial hearings.
   Ms. MacFarlane testified that she used games and picture
coloring to get some children talking about their alleged
molestations.
   The jury watched a videotape in which she asked a girl to
identify body parts on naked dolls.
   The defense has contended that the children were coached or
coerced by the social worker or their parents into alleging
molestation.
   Nine children have testified so far in the case that once
focused on 41 youngsters, but Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, said
outside court he had suspected that some child witnesses would be
dropped.
   ``The remaining three witnesses had more contradicitions and
unbelievable accounts (in their testimony),'' he said. ``They were
a liablity (to the prosecution.)
   ``I think the prosecution case is falling of its own weight.''

   Sixty-three anti-abortion activists using the
names ``Baby Jane Doe'' and ``Baby John Doe'' _ which they say
represent aborted fetuses _ will remain jailed until they tell
police their real names, a judge ruled.
   Police arrested 69 people over the weekend at three abortion
clinics in Atlanta, bringing to 276 the number of protesters
arrested since the series of demonstrations began during the
Democratic National Convention July 19.
   About 170 members of the group sponsoring the protest, Operation
Rescue, remained in jail Monday. Most are charged with criminal
trespass and giving a false name to police.
   Operation Rescue, based in Binghamton, N.Y., has been using a
cable television show hosted by former Republican presidential
candidate Pat Robertson to recruit volunteers to continue filling
the jails.
   On Monday, State Court judge Nick G. Lambros ruled the legal
cases against 63 of them would not proceed until they gave their
real names.
   Bob Fierer, an attorney for the activists, said he will abide by
the order ``unless or until some other court says it is not
correct.''
   Fulton County jail officials said they have spent $66,450 to
hold and feed those arrested; officials say the influx of
protesters is straining already crowded county facilities.
   Operation Rescue says lengthy daily coverage on the ``700
Club,'' Robertson's show on the Christian Broadcasting Network, is
helping attract many abortion opponents to Atlanta.
   ``He is our one link to Christians all across the country that
we have not had from the secular media,'' said the group's
spokesman, Lowell Patterson.
   The 700 Club, a 90-minute daily show with about a half-hour news
segment, has been carrying regular reports on the Atlanta
anti-abortion protests and flashing the Binghamton telephone number
on the screen during the reports.
   Robertson declined to be interviewed, but a spokeswoman said
Robertson contends he is only providing news coverage of an
important event.

<HEAD>Big Hurricane Year Could Help Ease Drought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weather experts usually are loathe to say
anything nice about hurricanes, but some are conceding that the big
tropical storms could be something of a blessing during the drought.
   People who don't live along the Atlantic or Gulf coasts should
be hoping for hurricanes, Douglas LeComte, editor of the
Agriculture Department's Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin, said
Tuesday.
   ``I think most people are really hoping for a benign hurricane
to move up the Mississippi Valley and really drench the Tennessee
Valley,'' LeComte said.
   ``What we really want is to get a hurricane and take the wind
away and take the tornadoes away but keep the rain,'' said Richard
Heim, a meteorologist at the National Climatic Data Center in
Asheville, N.C.
   ``Of course, if you get one you get the other,'' Heim observed,
so if ``we get a nice hurricane to put a dent in the drought, it
can also put a dent in a lot of people's property.''
   Hurricanes, nature's most powerful storms, develop over warm
tropical waters and churn into huge systems with winds as high as
100 mph or more. The hurricane season starts in June but the storms
tend to be most active in August and September.
   Right now, tropical storm Beryl is churning up the Gulf of
Mexico near New Orleans.
   Historically, hurricanes have caused massive destruction of
oceanfront properties. Weather experts say the winds and surge of
sea water driven ahead of the storms are especially dangerous. Once
they move inland, hurricanes lose the energy derived from the ocean
and break up, sometimes producing powerful thunderstorms.
   These storms often provide 5 inches of rain or more, and can
produce a major share of the annual moisture in some areas.
   In 1980, for example, a serious drought in Texas was broken by
the combined rains of Hurricane Allen and Tropical Storm Danielle.
   Yet hurricanes also can produce so much moisture that droughts
may be replaced by equally disastrous flooding.
   Alvin, Texas, was swamped by 43 inches of rain in 24 hours on
July 24-25, 1979. In two days in September 1950, Yankeetown, Fla.,
was drenched by 38.7 inches of rain.
   This year, as drought continues to plague much of the nation,
the onset of hurricane season _ even if the storms prove as benign
as LeComte would hope _ probably would benefit only limited areas.
   ``What we would like it to do, to help end the drought, is (for
a storm) to move into the Georgia and Tennessee and North Carolina
and Kentucky areas and sit here for two or three days. That's the
optimum thing,'' Heim said.
   Axel Graumann of the Asheville data center said hurricanes
usually move along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts and bring more
relief to the Southeast than most other areas. Others tend to move
northward as far as New England and Canada.
   It is possible for remnants of Gulf Coast hurricanes to move as
far inland as Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, ``but that is very,
very unlikely,'' Heim said. It is very rare for rain clouds from a
hurricane to become caught up in a cold front and move even farther
inland.
   ``About the only way to quickly make up the 10 to 15 inches of
rain needed in the Tennessee Valley would be a hurricane, but I
don't think anybody wants it all at once,'' LeComte said.

   A yacht scheduled to be used in the filming of a

along the coast and was not missing as previously believed, the
Coast Guard said today.
   The 67-foot Alina III left North Palm Beach Sunday morning for a
scheduled 12-hour trip to Key West. The Coast Guard began a search
when there was no sign of the boat by late Monday.
   Early today, however, it arrived in port, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard had asked other vessels off south Florida to
watch for the boat.
   The Bond movie, ``License Revoked,'' is being filmed in the Keys.

   Four lions died at a zoo after
their food was spiked with barbiturates, a police official said
Tuesday.
   The lions went into a coma at the zoo in Taiping, 150 miles
north of Kuala Lumpur, on July 31 and died one by one last week,
said Mohamad Yunus, assistant superintendent of police.
   He said anyone found guilty of committing such an offence under
the animal protection act could be fined up to $4,000 or be jailed
for five years or get both penalties.
   According to zoo veterinarian Kevin Lazarus, Raja, a 12-year-old
male lion, died Aug. 2; two lionesses, Ponni, 20, and Sheba, 9,
died Friday; and another lioness, Elsa, also 9, died Saturday.
   Sheba and Elsa were from Africa, while Raja and Ponni were Asian
lions.
   The Animal Research Institute in Ipoh is conducting postmortems
on the lions. Preliminary blood tests showed the presence of
barbiturates, which zoo authorities do not give to the animals.

   An air-traffic controller who said he lost his
position in a training program because of his race will be
reinstated, his lawyer said.
   Eddie Grant also is expected to receive a cash settlement that
probably will be ``in the six figures,'' said Phillip Wood.
   Grant, who's black, filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal
Opportunity Commission in 1987, contending the Federal Aviation
Administration harassed him and repeatedly denied him promotions.
   Grant, who worked as a controller at Meigs Airport near downtown
Chicago, applied for four transfers to O'Hare between 1982 and 1984
and was denied each time, Wood said. He won a spot in the tower
after he filed a complaint, but ``they promptly washed him out of
training'' after a 10-month stint, Wood said.
   Grant returned to Meigs where base pay is $20,000 a year lower
than O'Hare.
   FAA officials denied any wrongdoing.

   President Reagan, Vice President George Bush
and their wives will have lunch together Thursday and the two men
will address Cabinet members and political appointees on Friday
about the presidential campaign, the White House said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was still
uncertain whether Reagan and Bush will meet during the Republican
National Convention in New Orleans next week.
   Reagan is to fly to New Orleans on Sunday and leave on Tuesday
for his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif. The vice president, who is
scheduled to receive the GOP presidential nomination on Wednesday,
is due to arrive in New Orleans the day Reagan leaves.
   The president and vice president frequently have lunch together
in the Oval Office, most recently on July 28. Fitzwater said
Thursday's lunch would also give Barbara Bush and first lady Nancy
Reagan an opportunity to compare notes on the campaign.
   Fitzwater said he did not know whether Friday's meeting would be
public. It is believed to be the first time Reagan and Bush have
appeared together in a political setting since the president
endorsed the vice president after he nailed down the presidential
nomination.

   Seven Jews who have been denied permission to
emigrate were arrested or fined for conducting an illegal
demonstration, refuseniks said Tuesday.
   Police broke up the demonstration by Pavel and Faina Semyonov
and their supporters after about two minutes Monday evening and
arrested the protesters, said Vladimir Kislik.
   He said in a telephone interivew that Semyonov's father refuses
to sign a waiver of financial responsibility to allow the couple to
apply for emigratiion.
   Kislik said police told the group their demonstration near the
headquarters of the regional Communist Party headquarters in
northwestern Moscow was illegal because they had not received
government permission.
   But they said they had received no rejection of their request to
hold a demonstration, he reported.
   Mrs. Semyonov was sentenced to five days in jail and her husband
received a 10-day jail term. Yuri Semyonovsky was sentenced to 10
days in jail, Yevgeny Rubenshtein to 15 days, and Sergei Diki
received a five-day jail sentence. Anatoly Genis and his
16-year-old son Vsevolod were fined, Kislik said.

   The Irish Turf Board said Tuesday it
plans to sell pieces of the old sod to nostalgic Americans.
   Irish peat, suitably packaged with shamrocks, could be on sale
in the United States by Thanksgiving, according to the board.
   ``We do not see turf as an everyday product, but as a nostalgic
reminder of Ireland to burn on special occasions such as
Thanksgiving, Christmas or St. Patrick's Day,'' said John Foley,
marketing manager for the state-run group, which sells peat as fuel
in Ireland and Scotland.
   ``We want to sell our product as a piece of Ireland and although
the proposed packaging design has not yet been finalized it will
include shamrocks in some form,'' Foley said.
   The Turf Board, which sees as its potential customers 40 million
people in the United States claiming Irish origins, said it
initially wants to sell Irish turf in supermarkets on the East
Coast. Test marketing will begin shortly, it said.

   Police shot and killed a convict who escaped
last month while serving a life term in the assassination of
President Anwar Sadat, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
   A second escaped convict was wounded and arrested, it said.
   Police on Monday shot and killed Mohammed Khames, 40, after the
convict opened fire on them when they ambushed his apartment in the
Maadi suburb of Cairo, the ministry said.
   In a separate incident Monday, police arrested the second
convict, Ahmed Aswani, 31, in the Ghamra area of the city after he
fought them with gunfire and plastic bombs and was wounded.
   Aswani's brother, Tareq, and a police officer also were wounded
in the gunfight, the Interior Ministry said.
   Tareq had taken part in planning the July 17 escape of his
brother, Khames and a third convict, Essam Kemary, 37, from the
Tura prison on the outskirts of Cairo, the ministry said.
   The three convicts used iron bars to force open their cell
doors, then knocked down the prison guards, seizing their rifles
and shooting their way out.
   Eight days after the escape, police shot and killed Kemary in a
gunfight at the apartment where he was hiding with Khames and
Aswani, both of whom escaped.
   The Interior Ministry said police had recently arrested Khaled
Bekheit, the owner of the apartment.
   The three convicts and Bekheit were members of the Moslem
fundamentalist group Jihad, which was blamed for the Oct. 6, 1981,
assassination of Sadat.
   Three convicted assassins were executed by firing squad, another
two were hanged, and more than 120 were sentenced to prison terms.
   Khames, Aswani and Kemary were given life sentences for taking
part in plotting the assassination.

   Officials in Oregon today called off plans to evacuate resorts
threatened by wildfires and tourism in Wyoming's Yellowstone
National Park returned to normal, but crews continued battling
blazes in Montana and Idaho.
   The largest forest fire of Oregon's season moved away from two
lakeside resorts in the Deschutes National Forest when winds
shifted, Forest Service officials said.
   The fire, which had consumed 12,500 acres by this morning,
threatened the resorts Monday; campers and tourists were warned
they might be evacuated.
   ``The evacuation plans we developed are on the back burner at
this point and hopefully they'll stay there,'' said Kathy Solberg,
a Forest Service spokeswoman.
   In Oregon, the only injury reported was that of a pilot whose
helicopter crashed while carrying water to the blaze Monday. The
pilot was listed in fair condition today at a hospital, where he
was treated for a head injury, cuts and bruises.
   In Wyoming, tourists continued pouring into Yellowstone, despite
forest fires covering some 180,000 acres of the park.
   Lower temperatures and higher humidy have curbed many fires.
   ``The fires have slowed down,'' spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said.
``I know we did not see significant increase in acreage, and all
the fires continue to be contained within the park boundaries.''
   The cooler weather is allowing some smoke to lift, giving
tourists a closer look at some burned acreage where many trees
survived the flames. The south entrance to the park was open all
weekend; Anzelmo said visitation was back up to normal levels for
this time of year.
   In Montana, crews were trying to contain a 630-acre fire south
of Glacier National Park while contending with grizzly bears.
   Nearly 150 firefighters and smokejumpers, backed by aerial
bombers and helicopters, battled the stubborn, wind-blown fire
Monday.
   Extra precautions were ordered with food and sleeping
arrangements because grizzlies roam the area, said fire boss Dave
Bunnell. Firefighters also were told to work in groups, he said.
   In eastern Idaho, fire crews tried to get under control a
1,500-acre blaze in remote, roadless terrain.
   ``We had another pretty good day. Fire crews kept the fire
within control lines, but there are a couple of areas that pose a
threat,'' Targhee National Forest spokesman Gary Cornell said.

   A 27-year-old woman who camped out in a pickup
truck while awaiting a life-saving liver transplant left the
hospital Tuesday for a nearby apartment.
   Pollie Smolenski, who underwent surgery June 16 and June 21, was
discharged with fanfare from Presbyterian-University Hospital, but
must stay nearby during recuperation, said hospital spokeswoman
Susan Ruth.
   She may return home to Hallie, Ky., in as little as two weeks,
Ms. Ruth said.
   ``I got the second transplant on my birthday and I considered
that a gift of life,'' Mrs. Smolenski, the mother of three
children, said at a hospital news conference.
   ``I have a whole lot more energy now and I'm looking forward to
laying around and then being a mother again,'' she said.
   For now, Mrs. Smolenski and her husband, Dan, will stay six
blocks from the hospital in a $752-a-month apartment donated by the
landlord, National Development Corp.
   The woman, who suffered from a rare liver disorder called
primary biliary cirrhosis, entered the hospital for evaluation May
17 and was discharged June 7, when she moved into a camper atop her
parents' pickup truck as she awaited a call for a liver transplant.
   Her parents, Raymond and Ersley Eldridge, parked the truck in an
empty parking lot at the University of Pittsburgh. The family
bathed with wet sponges and used public toilets in hospitals and
dormitories for more than five days.
   Police officers donated sandwiches and doughnuts. Finally,
campus policeman Jesse Long called university officials for help
when the couple said their daughter was growing weaker in hot
temperatures. University officials put up the family for one night
in a dormitory before the landlords offered the furnished apartment.
   Hospital spokeswoman Jane Duffield said officials had been
unaware the family lacked adequate housing.
   Her husband, whose 31st birthday is Wednesday, said Tuesday that
his wife's release was his present.
   ``You know how the license plates in Pennsylvania say, `You've
got a friend in Pennsylvania?' I believe that now,'' Smolenski said.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd said
today there is no room for further compromise with Republicans on
aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels because ``we've gone as far as we
can go.''
   Byrd, D-W.Va., told reporters he is prepared to press the
Democratic aid plan to a vote and continues to hope it will attract
bipartisan support.
   ``That would send the right message to Central America,'' he
said.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
``we're still hopeful of getting a Contra aid package passed.''
   Speaking to reporters not long after President Reagan met with
Republican congressional leaders, Fitzwater said ``the Democrats
say they want a bill.'' But he also said that ``the language (of
the Democratic bill) is convoluted.''
   Many Republican senators made it clear Monday they do not trust
the Democrats to carry out their side of the bargain. They said the
Democratic aid plan is seriously flawed because it does not contain
adequate resources to deliver stockpiled arms to the Contras and
has no guarantee House Speaker James Wright will permit a vote.
   Byrd was asked if there was any flexibility on his side of the
issue.
   ``No, I don't think so,'' he replied. ``It seems to me we've
gone as far as we can go.''
   Fitzwater said the administration is concerned about what he
called weaknesses in the Democratic bill with respect to systems
for getting assistance delivered to the Contras.
   He said that bill ``would have the impact of saying you can
deliver it in Honduras but not in Nicaragua, and that's where the
troops are.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, speaking Monday
after a private meeting in which many Republicans objected to the
Democratic plan, said he would take ``one more shot'' at
negotiating a bipartisan aid package.
   However, he added: ``I wouldn't want to be overly optimistic.''
   Byrd also said he hoped some compromise could be reached.
   But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said compromise was unlikely
because the debate over aid to the rebels fighting Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government ``has been so long, so emotional, so
partisan, that there's little trust.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who took part in talks with
Republicans on the compromise legislation last week, said flatly,
``The negotiations are over. I don't think there is any more room.
We've gone as far as we can go.''
   The Democratic plan would permit $27.1 million in immediate
non-lethal ``humanitarian'' aid to the Contras.
   It also would give President Reagan an opportunity to ask
Congress this fall to release some $16.3 million in previously
purchased arms, ammunition and other military supplies now stored
in warehouses in Central America.
   But it also requires Reagan to certify that such military aid to
the Contras is justified because Nicaragua has disrupted the
``peace and stability'' of Central America by taking two of these
three actions: an unprovoked military attack on the Contras,
``blatant violations'' of the regional peace plan, and continued
``unacceptable levels of military assistance by Soviet-bloc
countries, including Cuba.''
   Some senators said Nicaragua's rulers could prevent the military
aid from being released ``just by being good boys for 30 days.''
   Conservative Republicans called on Dole to force a vote on a
Republican alternative which would make $20 million in new U.S.
military aid available to the Contras as well as releasing
previously approved military aid from warehouses and providing the
``humanitarian'' assistance.
   Sources inside the meeting said Army Lt. Gen. Colin Powell,
President Reagan's national security adviser, reported that he has
``serious reservations'' about the plan.
   Byrd said that if progress is not made in reconstructing a
bipartisan alliance on the issue, he will offer the Democratic aid
plan as an amendment to the pending Defense Department
appropriations bill.
   Contra leaders contacted the White House and several GOP
senators Monday morning to declare their unanimous opposition to
that plan.
   Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the Contra resistance forces,
said Contra leaders see the Democratic plan as resulting from
``internal politics in the United States which basically seek to
reward (Nicaraguan President) Daniel Ortega for not complying with
the commitments of the peace process.''

   Authorities are considering a

weekend brawl at the famous Newmarket horse track.
   Police arrested nine people in the death of Keith Dance, 24, who
was hit with a bottle during a fight in a parking lot among two
busloads of drunken spectators after Saturday's races.
   Representatives of the Jockey Club ordered a review of the sales
of liquor at race meets. The senior steward of the Jockey Club,
Lord Fairhaven, said he feared that guidelines on drinking and
security needed to be strengthened.
   Other sports, such as soccer and boxing, have banned alcohol
from arenas because of crowd misbehavior.
   Under Jockey Club regulations, racegoers are forbidden to take
alcohol onto the course and drinking is restricted to certain areas.

   Defense contractors routinely overcharge the
government for spare parts, and the excess charges, although small
in percentage terms, total hundreds of millions of dollars, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   An unusually broad internal defense audit found that nearly half
the contracts reviewed involved some measure of overcharging.
   In the majority of instances, the auditors reported, the
overcharges resulted from a military contractor's failure to abide
by a law requiring the company to share with the government the
latest information it has on labor and material costs.
   If the Pentagon receives ``defective'' cost or pricing data in
the course of contract negotiations, the result is almost always an
overcharge to the government, the auditors noted.
   The audit, conducted by the Pentagon's inspector general, took
more than three years to complete and was one of the largest ever
conducted. It reviewed 774 contracts and subcontracts, worth a
combined $54.3 billion, held by 95 companies.
   ``Of the 774 pricing actions audited, 365 (47.2 percent) were
overpriced by $788.9 million,'' the report said.
   ``The principal reasons for the overpricing were that
contractors did not comply with Public Law 87-653, Truth in
Negotiations Act, on 359 of the 774 pricing actions.''
   That level of overpricing amounts to slightly less than 1.5
percent of the total value of the contracts audited, the report
added.
   By law, the Defense Department can recover money overcharged by
contractors, with interest. The government's claims can be
contested by the contractors and the disputes resolved through
negotiations.
   The Pentagon, in releasing the inspector general's audit,
announced the department had so far recovered $283 million of the
$788.9 million identified in the report.
   ``The department will continue to examine all costs questioned
and to recommend appropriate actions,'' the Pentagon added.
   The inspector general concluded his report by suggesting the
Pentagon hire more auditors, recommending the department ``provide
the funding and resources needed to substantially increase the
level of defective price audit coverage provided.''
   The report noted that, historically, the audit agency can
recover about $19 in excess costs for every dollar spent on price
audits.
   That recommendation, however, already has become the subject of
an internal dispute. Robert W. Helm, the Pentagon's comptroller,
said in comments attached to the report he did not view the
findings as adequate justification for the expense of hiring more
auditors.
   He and other Pentagon officials said the current force of
auditors could improve the situation by helping defense contractors
devise more accurate methods of estimating costs for use during
negotiations.

<TEXT>
   Rodrigo Borja, the socialist
president-elect, takes office Wednesday committed to ending
Ecuador's pro-U.S. stand, reversing free-market economic policies
and negotiating easier terms on the foreign debt.
   Borja, who leads the Democratic Left party, has said one of his
first acts will be to renew diplomatic ties with Nicaragua's
leftist Sandinista government.
   A U.S. official said privately Washington feels it can work with
the new president. ``Borja may prove to be a problem for the U.S.
at times, but he is no threat to democracy in Ecuador,'' the
official said.
   Relations with Nicaragua were broken in October 1985 by
conservative President Leon Febres Cordero, Washington's closest
ally in South America, whom Borja replaces. Febres Cordero could
not run for re-election becaue the constitution does not permit a
president to serve consecutive terms.
   ``Re-establishment of relations is a sign that our government is
independent and sovereign,'' said Gonzalo Ortiz, official spokesman
of the new administration.
   Borja, a 53-year-old law professor who is a vice president of
the Socialist International, is a longtime political foe of Febres
Cordero and lost a presidential election runoff to him in 1984. He
won the presidency in May, defeating populist candidate Abdala
Bucaram.
   Ecuador, a South American nation of 10 million people about the
size of Colorado, returned to democracy in 1979 after nine years of
civilian and military dictatorships.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua is among seven Latin
American presidents, most of them leftists, scheduled to attend.
They include Fidel Castro of Cuba, whose trips abroad are not
frequent, and his visit is viewed in Ecuador as an unusual show of
support for the new president.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will represent the United
States. Mario Soares, the socialist president of Portugal, also
plans to attend.
   Borja has said he will seek close relations with the
organization of nations that profess non-alignment and end Febres
Cordero's free-market policies, which he blames for the worst
recession since Ecuador began exporting oil in the early 1970s.
   The economy shrank by 3.5 percent in 1987 and the annual
inflation rate is nearly 60 percent, the highest in five years.
Fewer than half the nation's workers have full-time jobs.
   Febres Cordero took pride in meeting obligations on the $9.2
billion foreign debt for most of his four-year term, but no
payments have been made since January and Ecuador is more than $1
billion in arrears.
   Officials of the Febres Cordero government blame the nation's
economic problems on the decline of world oil prices and
earthquakes that crippled the oil industry for six months in 1987.
   The new president has said he will impose exchange controls,
restrict imports to save dollar reserves and control prices of
basic consumer goods to fight inflation.
   He also has announced plans for a more restrictive policy toward
foreign investment and, unless creditors agree to easier terms, a
moratorium on foreign debt payments.
   ``I don't believe the debt is payable under the present
circumstances,'' he said recently.
   Personal animosity between Borja and Febres Cordero has created
problems in the transition of power.
   Febres Cordero said he would not attend the inauguration or
follow the Ecuadorean custom of personally turning over the
presidential sash to his successor.
   ``Since the wellfare of the Ecuadorean people depends on the
next government, may God help them and insure their success,'' he
said Friday. ``But knowing them as I do, I have my doubts.''
   Besides the personal feud, Ecuador's political turmoil in recent
years has included two unsuccessful military rebellions against
Febres Cordero, a kidnapping of the president in which disaffected
paratroopers held him for 11 hours, and an attempt by the
opposition-controlled Congress to impeach him.
   Borja has accused Febres Cordero of trying to sabotage the new
government by creating economic problems before he takes office.
   ``We are concerned by the bankrupt state in which we are
receiving Ecuador,'' he said, and charged the Febres Cordero
administration with creating an 11 percent budget deficit ``to
cause us difficulties'' with inflation.
   Interior Minister Heinz Moeller described the complaints as
``whining.''

   Police arrested two people accused of
selling counterfeit three-day passes to Walt Disney World after the
park confiscated about 500 bogus tickets at its gates.
   Police cameras filmed the two selling fake tickets from their
hotel room, and about 100 fake tickets were confiscated following
the arrests of Patricia Trippensee, 45, and Charles Evans, 58, said
Osceola County sheriff's Sgt. Chuck Lavender.
   The two allegedly sold tickets to small distributors and booth
dealers throughout central Florida. The dealers did not know the
tickets were well-made fakes, according to Lavender.
   Disney officials discovered the counterfeit tickets when they
failed to find imprinted security markings. The real tickets sell
for $78 and the fake ones were going for $70, Lavender said.
   Disney customers turning up with counterfeit tickets were given
complimentary one-day tickets.
   Ms. Trippensee and Evans were charged with grand theft and were
being held in the Osceola County Jail on $25,000 bail each.

   Five shipwrecked Iranian fishermen rescued by
the USS Vincennes have been transferred to another Navy ship to
await the completion of arrangements for their return to Iran, the
Pentagon said Tuesday.
   The Vincennes, the cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian
airliner last month with 290 people aboard, picked up the five
Iranians on Sunday in the Gulf of Oman, just south of the Persian
Gulf, while on patrol. The men said their fishing boat had sunk and
that they had been floating in a small dinghy for eight days.
   Dan Howard, the Defense Department's chief spokesman, said the
Iranians had been transferred to the guided-missile cruiser USS
Texas, which also is operating in the Gulf of Oman.
   Howard declined to predict how long the men would remain aboard
that vessel, saying the Pentagon had yet to hear from the State
Department about how the men would be returned to Iran. Those
arrangements must be made through diplomatic channels and the
discussions are still in progress, he said.

   Two men who traded illegal alligator
hides for illegal Alaska hunting trips have pleaded guilty to three
misdemeanor counts of violating federal wildlife laws.
   Under the plea agreement accepted Monday, prosecutors will
recommend fines of at least $10,000 each, but will not oppose
defense requests for probation. Sentencing was set for Oct. 17.
   The maximum penalty under the law is three years in prison and
$300,000 in fines.
   Ira Wendell Blue, 41, and Craig Sellers, 42, acknowledged
arranging to circumvent laws protecting grizzly bears, mountain
sheep and mountain goats. They also said they illegally possessed
alligator hides, which they used, along with the promise of use of
a Florida condominum and auto-race tickets, to trade for guide
services on illegal hunting trips in 1984, 1985 and 1986.

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators today blamed the leftist
guerrilla group Comando Simon Bolivar for the bombing attack on
Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   The group, which described itself as ``anti-imperialist'' in
calls to news agencies claiming responsiblity for Monday's blast,
also was behind at least two other bombings in Bolivia since April
1987.
   On Monday, Foreign Minister Guillermo Bedregal said both the
attack on Shultz's motorcade and a dawn bombing at the U.S. Embassy
commissary in La Paz were the work of cocaine traffickers.
   The Native National Force of Pablo Zarate Wilca, a previously
unknown group, also called reporters to say it was behind Monday's
bombings, but officials discounted that claim.
   Bolivian investigators offered no elaboration on why they gave
credit to the claim of responsibility from the Comando Simon
Bolivar group. They would only say the group carried out other
bombings and bank robberies.
   A remote-controlled bomb damaged three cars in Shultz's
11-vehicle motorcade Monday as he drove to La Paz from the airport.
The blast ruptured a tire and blew out three windows, including one
next to Shultz's wife.
   No injuries were reported in the roadway blast or in the bombing
at the U.S commissary.
   Police said the roadway bomb, believed to be several sticks of
dynamite, was set off by someone on a hill overlooking the road
seconds after Shultz's car passed. The blast tore up pavement and
threw rocks across the road.
   On Monday night, Shultz praised Bolivian efforts he said have
put drug lords on the run. The secretary of state, whose visit
intended in part to express U.S. support for anti-drug efforts,
said he was not ``intimidated by the tactic of using violence to
try to scare government officials.''
   After giving a talk entitled ``Winning The War Against
Narcotics'' at a La Paz hotel, Shultz left through a back exit
under extremely tight security and was driven to the airport for a
flight to Costa Rica.
   This time, the airport road was cordoned off.
   The 67-year-old Shultz has been secretary of state since 1982.
He has traveled widely but has never before been attacked.
   In his talk to government officials and business leaders, Shultz
praised Bolivia's cooperation with the United States in recent
anti-drug efforts.
   He said Congress ``has looked at your law and your performance
with great interest, and I trust that your steady commitment will
convince the members of our legislative body of your serious
intentions. To sum up, the drug traffickers are in trouble in
Bolivia.''
   Last month, Bolivia passed a law that declares 90 percent of
coca plantations in the country illegal and imposes stiff penalties
on coca producers and traffickers.
   It also captured Roberto Suarez Gomez, who the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration called one of the world's leading
cocaine traffickers. Suarez Gomez is serving a 15-year prison
sentence.
   U.S. economic aid topped the agenda in meetings with Shultz,
said Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. He said Shultz
had promised to speed up disbursements of funds Congress has
approved.
   The United States has allocated $75 million in aid to Bolivia
for fiscal 1988. Of that amount, $15 million is earmarked for
narcotics interdiction and crop substitution efforts.
   But Bedregal says Bolivia needs at least $120 million a year to
effectively combat the drug industry, which brings in up to $500
million a year, compared to $470 million for all legal exports
combined.
   Aside from funding for development programs in the main coca
producing region, the U.S. government has an estimated 40 special
forces and Navy troops as well as border patrol and DEA agents in
Bolivia.
   They have trained and equipped 650 Bolivian anti-narcotics
police and assisted in raiding cocaine processing pits in the
Chapare, where 80 percent of Bolivia's cocaine is produced.
   Police, however, must often attack cocaine processing labs using
World War II-vintage carbines while traffickers have sophisticated
automatic weapons.
   Shultz said the ``the United States, as the biggest consumer of
drugs in the world, has a special responsibility in this battle.''
   ``The pirates and warlords of the drug business have fought you
at every step, with money, intimidation and violence,'' he told the
gathering. ``But there can be no question that Bolivia has made the
right choice. We salute you for that choice.''
   U.S. cooperation with government efforts to fight the drug trade
has angered the 350,000 farmers _ from among Bolivia's 6.7 million
population _ who depend on coca leaf farming and cocaine production
for a living.
   They say the U.S. and Bolivian governments are not doing enough
to assist in the transition to other crops.
   Shultz, on a 10-day, nine-country Latin American tour, flew to
Bolivia from Brazil. His tour began Aug. 1 in Guatemala City and is
scheduled to end Wednesday in Ecuador.

<HEAD>Family Seeks Daughter Because Transplant Is Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen-year-old Kenny Hammonds has a rare
blood disease and needs a bone marrow transplant, and his family is
looking for his wandering sister, who they last saw nearly 11
months ago.
   ``Please come home,'' Kenny said Monday of his 20-year-old
sister, Sandra Lynn Hammonds.
   Kenny has aplastic anemia, which his doctor described as a
``one-in-a-million'' illness in which the bone marrow virtually
shuts down and stops producing blood cells. Kenny feels fine and
appears healthy, but Dr. Lawrence Tokaz said he has moderately low
blood counts that will keep getting lower unless something is done.
   ``He's a good kid, champion soccer player,'' said Kenny's
father, Earl Hammonds. ``He's played all-star soccer. The kid makes
good grades. He's on the honor society. He's the kid everybody
wants. He's the kid, if you wanted a kid, you'd say, `Hey, this one
here will be fine, I think I'll take that one.' He's one of those
type kids, respectful to his mother and father. And he studies.
He's a good boy. Kenny is a good boy.''
   Tokaz said the best chance for recovery is a transplant of bone
marrow from one of Kenny's two sisters, which should restore
Kenny's ability to reproduce blood cells.
   His other sister, Eloise, 28, of Mobile, Ala., has returned to
Austin for a possible transplant but the family also wants to find
Sandra soon in case no one else would be a suitable donor.
   Eloise and her parents planned to be tested this week to see if
one of them qualifies, but the results of those tests will not be
known for several days.
   ``What if nothing happens by then?'' Hammonds asked. ``We'll
have used up all this time, and all of a sudden you've hit a zero.
Then what?''
   But Sandra faces fraudulent check charges here in Travis County,
said her father, a corrections officer for the sheriff's office,
and the family has lost touch with her. She was apparently in Fort
Wayne, Ind., in recent weeks, and also has lived in Virginia Beach,
Va., and Mobile, Ala., since they last saw her.
   Hammond said he is confident his daughter will return if she
knows about her brother.
   ``She'd probably have to go to jail, and I think Sandra knows
that,'' he said. ``But if she heard that her brother was in
trouble, she would come.''

   Robert Ricci, a perfume-maker and couturier who
with his mother founded one of France's leading fashion houses, has
died at the age of 83.
   Ricci, president of Couture et Parfums Nina Ricci, died Monday
in his Paris home, a company spokesman said.
   The son of jeweler Louis Ricci, he was born in Paris on July 29,
1905. As a young man, he became interested in maketing and graphic
art.
   In 1932, at age 27, he and his mother, Nina, founded the fashion
house Nina Ricci, and as president oversaw both the business and
creative aspects of the business. His mother, who died in 1970,
provided artistic inspiration.
   The pre-war success of the company was rapid. Nina Ricci had 22
employees in 1932. By 1939, there were 450.
   In 1946, after the war, he created the first Nina Ricci perfume,
Coeur-Joie, followed by L'Air du Temps in 1948, which became a
classic.
   Ricci went international after the war and began diversifying
into other areas, such as accessories, glasses and jewelry.
   Nina Ricci has operations in 130 countries. In 1987, it had
consolidated revenues of $156 million. Perfumes make up 75 percent
of the company's sales, and 70 percent of the perfume division's
sales come from L'Air du Temps.
   Funeral services were scheduled for Thursday at Notre Dame
d'Auteuil church.

<HEAD>Renovation To Begin On Another House For Ole Miss Black Fraternity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black fraternity will make its debut this
fall on the University of Mississippi's all-white Fraternity Row
despite an apparent arson fire because the school will renovate
another house for the group.
   The university has received tentative approval to assume the
obligation of renovating the vacant Phi Kappa Theta fraternity
house, three houses up the block from the Phi Beta Sigma house that
burned Thursday, Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner said Monday.
   ``The morning of the fire, we were in touch with them (Phi Kappa
Theta),'' Turner said. ``We felt like with its being available ...
the most immediate need was to get Phi Beta Sigma on Fraternity
Row.''
   Police patrols have increased since fire destroyed the house
that Phi Beta Sigma members had planned to lease from another
fraternity, Turner said.
   The 20-member black Phi Beta Sigma had been readying the vacant
40- to 50-year-old brick and wood house for the fall.
   Fire officials said they discovered evidence of a fire
accelerant in a closet on the second floor, where the blaze began.
The evidence was turned over Monday to the state Crime Lab.
   The renovation work, estimated to cost $15,000 to $20,000, will
be paid for through a fund drive launched Friday by the
university's Interfraternity Council, Turner said.
   ``There have been a lot of inquiries on how to assist from
within the state and outside, from fraternity groups on campus,
civic groups, alumni and friends,'' said Ed Meek, university
director of public relations. ``I believe we'll reach the $20,000
goal easily.''

   Tropical Storm Beryl moved onshore across New
Orleans today, prompting storm alerts for 16 coastal parishes and
raising hopes that it would move farther inland and dissipate
without causing serious damage.
   ``If it continues to move west or northwest, Beryl should
gradually weaken,'' the National Weather Service reported.
   There was still a chance the storm might move back over the Gulf
of Mexico and gain strength before returning to land, but
forecasters said that would e unusual.
   The Coast Guard today rescued six people who were forced to take
refuge on Petit Bois Island, south of Pascagoula, Miss., after the
storm prevented them from landing their boat on the mainland,
authorities said.
   More Louisiana coastal communities were evacuated as the storm,
which had already forced thousands of offshore oil workers inland,
drifted slowly along the Louisiana-Mississippi Gulf Coast.
   No injuries or serious damage were reported.
   As of 11 a.m. CDT, the National Weather Service said the center
of the season's second tropical storm in the eastern United States
was 50 miles west of New Orleans, near latitude 30.0 north,
longitude 90.6 west.
   The storm's highest sustained winds were near 40 mph, mainly in
squalls in coastal waters, the service said.
   Although widespread heavy rains were not reported at midday over
Louisiana, officials said locally heavy storms threatened areas to
the east and southeast of the storm center with flooding.
   Almost a foot of rain fell at Dauphin Island, Ala., in the Gulf
of Mexico for the 24-hour period ending at 7 a.m. today, the
weather service said. Officials reported many tourists leaving
motels in Gulf Shores on the coast.
   More than three inches of rain fell on Biloxi, Miss., during a
six-hour period ending at 1 a.m., forecasters reported.
   Thousands of workers from the marshes and offshore oil rigs were
evacuated Monday as a precaution.
   ``We're on cautious alert now and we don't expect to go beyond
that,'' said Andy Valence, mayor of Grand Isle, a coastal town
about 40 miles south of New Orleans.
   Homes were being evacuated today east of New Orleans in the
low-lying St. Bernard Parish fishing villages of Hopedale,
Yscloskey and Shell Beach. Coastal tides were three to four feet
above normal, but were expected to reach seven feet above normal.
   Beryl formed over Lake Pontchartrain and became a tropical storm
Monday. It is rare for an inland storm to move offshore, the
weather service said. The danger is that the storm will pick up
steam over the Gulf and come back.
   ``Better this week than next week,'' said Bill Phillips, manager
of the Republican National Convention set Aug. 15-18 in the
Superdome. The storm did not delay Vice President George Bush, who
arrived Monday to address the 1988 Platform Committee.
   Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa said about 2,000 workers were
evacuated by boat and helicopter from offshore rigs to Venice,
Leeville and Morgan City.
   There were scattered power failures along the Mississippi Gulf
Coast on Monday and stores reported heavy sales of supplies like
flashlights and batteries. But weathering the big storms in the
past made some residents blase.
   ``We went through Camille, Elena and Frederic,'' said Jean
Wilson of Biloxi, Miss. ``This is too small to worry about.''
   Hotel guests on the Alabama Gulf Coast, however, started
checking out in droves as the stormy weather came Monday. ``We
experienced a 50 percent drop in business,'' said Steve Bergeron,
manager of the Holiday Inn in Gulf Shores.
   A tropical weather system becomes a named storm when its winds
hit 39 mph and a hurricane when wind velocity reaches 74 mph.
   The last major Gulf Coast hurricane was Camille in 1969, which
packed 218 mph winds. It killed 320 people and did millions in
damage. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November
30 with August and September the most active months.

<HEAD>Chinese Official Says U.S. Ready to Permit Satellite Launches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington has indicated it will allow U.S.
businessmen to launch satellites on Chinese rockets, a pro-Beijing
newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Yu Fusheng, vice general manager of China Great Wall Industry
Corp., said Monday the U.S. State Department unofficially had made
it known to Chinese officials that Washington would not oppose the
shipment of satellites to China for launch, the newspaper Wen Wei
Po reported.
   Gen. William Burns, director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, said at a news conference in this British
colony after returning from Beijing that he could not comment on
the report.
   The United States and the Coordinating Committee for Export
Control of 16 Western nations have held up requests to use Chinese
rockets to launch satellites for foreign companies.
   Security concerns and accusations of China's alleged unfair
price advantage because of government subsidization have been cited
as reasons for refusing to allow the launches.
   The newspaper quoted Yu, whose state-run company is in charge of
launching satellites on Communist China's Long March rockets, as
playing down security concerns. He stressed that the launch service
was a business endeavor and not an attempt to obtain foreign
technology.
   Foreign companies would be allowed to watch over their
satellites in China, the newspaper quoted him as saying. The
satellites would be considered in transit from the time they enter
China through customs until launch, Yu said.
   He also denied that China would allow its launch service to be
used for satellites with military applications, the newspaper
reported from Beijing.
   Yu also claimed that China was able to offer low-priced
satellite launchings partly because labor costs are lower than in
other countries offering such services and not because of
government subsidies.
   Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of Hughes Communications
International, has asked the State Department to approve Chinese
launching of a U.S.-built satellite for an Australian company.
   Asia Satellite Communications, a Hong Kong-based consortium,
also has asked Washington for permission to send up a U.S.-made
satellite on a Long March rocket next year.
   Pressure from Western governments has prevented China's
international satellite launching industry from getting of the
ground. Although Beijing has signed accords with several countries,
including Britain and Sweden, on space cooperation, the only firm
deal has been a joint venture reached with Brazil.
   That satellite, to be used to study flora, minerals and
underground water supplies, is scheduled for launch in 1992.

   The bodies of 10 people who died in
India's worst ferry disaster were cremated Tuesday on the banks of
the Ganges River as police fired seven gunshots in honor of the
more than 400 passengers believed drowned.
   Hindu and Moslem priests prayed as the bodies were placed on
wooden logs and set aflame near the river that Hindus consider
sacred. About 1,000 relatives and villagers watched silently.
   The 35-year-old steam-powered ferry overturned Saturday when it
hit a sand bar while crossing the river and hurled at least 542
people into the surging waters about 650 miles east of New Delhi.
   About 100 people swam to shore or were rescued by villagers in
small boats. Only 30 bodies have been recovered and the rest of the
passengers are presumed dead, officials said.
   Most of the passengers were Hindu pilgrims on their way to a
shrine.
   The government blamed the accident on overcrowding and safety
violations, according to officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The ferry had a capacity of 160.
   Two steam-powered boats and 70 rescue workers have tried to pull
the vessel from the river bed, but the search has been hampered by
swift currents and rising water levels caused by monsoon rains.
   Asgar Ali, who heads the recovery effort, said bodies are
believed to be trapped inside the ferry, but none have been found
so far. He said many of the bodies were carried away by strong
currents.
   India's worst previous ferry disaster occurred in 1970, when at
least 150 people drowned in the Krishna River in the southern state
of Andhra Pradesh.

   Vice President George Bush today accused
Michael Dukakis of trying to ``run away'' from a record ``on the

losing his lead in the presidential race.
   Bush, at a news conference here, predicted Dukakis would fall
back from the 17-point advantage he has registered in some national
polls.
   ``That is turning around,'' Bush said. ``You watch, in the next
couple of days you'll see evidence of the turnaround on that.'' He
did not elaborate.
   Just six days before the opening of the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans, where he will become the GOP
presidential nominee, Bush said he still has not decided who will
be his running mate.
   ``I'm not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final
decision,'' the vice president said. Bush has said he wants to keep
it a secret until the final day of the convention.
   Bush spoke at an airport news conference here after a speech
earlier in Erie. Later, he planned to fly to Philadelphia for a
ribbon-cutting at the Polish-American Congress Museum and to take
part in a crime-fighting effort called the ``National Night Out
Against Crime.'' Americans in more than 7,200 towns plan to turn on
porch and house lights as a symbolic message that they intend to
fight for safer neighborhoods.
   Bush did not mention Dukakis in his speech, but went after him
at the news conference.
   ``He's trying to run away from a record in Massachusetts on the
very, very far liberal fringe of the political spectrum, and I have
to pin him down and I have to get him to say what he's really for,'
Bush said. ``And he's unwilling to do that because he thinks he can
preempt the middle.''
   Bush said he was urging speakers the GOP convention to be
positive and to focus on the issues.
   ``But I can't guarantee that somebody's not going to take a
swipe at Michael Dukakis,'' Bush said. ``I have a lot of friends
out there and they didn't like the vicious, personal attacks
(against Bush at the Democratic convention) and I did not react to
them, but I can't control everbody but I'm urging them to stay
positive, as I'm doing.''
   In Erie earlier, Bush blamed liberals in Congress for
undermining the battle against illegal drugs and told a gathering
of police officers, ``Let's get tougher on the criminals.''
   In a speech billed as non-partisan, Bush did not mention Dukakis
by name. But he criticized the American Civil Liberties Union,
whose members he has said include Dukakis.
   He said that to win the war against drugs the nation must be as
committed as it was in World War II ``when the whole nation then
pulled together, one purpose, one cause, everyone working in
exactly the same direction. We've got to plan an attack at every
level of government.''
   Bush spoke before the Pennsylvania chapter of the Fraternal
Order of Police on his last major campaign trip before the
Republican National Convention.
   Trying to forge an image as a hard-liner on law enforcement,
Bush said, ``When it comes to criminal justice our first priority
must be to keep the criminals away from the good and decent people
who want to raise their families in peace and safety.
   ``There are those, like the ACLU, whose first concerns are the
protection of the criminals' rights and the potential abuse of
power by police,'' the vice president said. ``My first concerns are
the protection of law-abiding citizens and the abuse of our system
of constitutional protections by thugs who can go and hire smart
lawyers and find the right judges to set them free.
   ``So let's not take away the guns of innocent citizens,'' he
continued. ``Let's get tougher on the criminals.''
   Bush said that too often police are being denied the ammunition
they need to fight the battle against drugs. ``Congress is full of
rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to law
enforcement a lot of the liberals there go AWOL,'' he said.
   Bush said the budget request for the Coast Guard was slashed by
$72 million last year in order to provide more money for mass
transit and Amtrak, resulting in a 55 percent reduction in Coast
Guard air and sea patrols.
   He also blamed ``the liberals in the Senate'' for derailing
sentencing guidelines necessary for implementing a federal death
penalty under constitutional standards set by a 1972 Supreme Court
decision.
   Bush said Americans must insist that judges accept new federal
sentencing guidelines that mandate consistently tougher penalties.
   ``We also need to change the legal technicalities that set
criminals free,'' he said. ``There's something wrong with the
system when the modern-day version of a prison break is crawling
through a loophole.''
   He praised the administration of former Pennsylvania Gov.
Richard Thornburgh, now the attorney general-designate, for
reducing by 94 percent the early release of convicted felons in the
state and said Thornburgh effectively ended the early release or
parole of first-degree murderers.
   Bush called for more money for building prisons and said that
unnecessary military bases should be converted to prisons or
rehabilitation facilities. He also urged that states that have
decriminalized possession of drugs should reverse course.
   ``And to those who say drugs should be legalized I say this _
legalization is just another word for surrender, and surrender is
not in America's vocabulary.''
   One day earlier, Bush praised Jesse Jackson's efforts to compat
drug abuse, saying, ``Anybody who can raise the consciousness of
the young people of this country about staying away from drugs
certainly can have a useful role.'' But he made no promises when
asked if the former Democratic presidential candidate might have a
role in his administration working on the drug issue.

<TEXT>
   The PBS-TV show ``Rumpole of the Bailey
Mystery'' has been disqualified as an Emmy nominee in the
miniseries category because it was a number of separate stories
rather than one continuous show.
   It has been replaced with ABC-TV's ``The Bourne Identity,'' said
John Leverence of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
   Producers of ``Rumpole'' incorrectly entered the six-part series
as a miniseries, which tells one story with a beginning, middle and
ending, Leverence said Tuesday. ``Rumpole,'' he said, has a number
of separate stories.
   Also nominated in the miniseries category was ABC's ``Baby M,''
NBC's ``Billionaire Boys Club,'' NBC's ``Gore Vidal's Lincoln'' and
NBC's ``The Murder of Mary Phagan.''
   ``The Bourne Identity,'' which aired May 8-9, was sixth in the
original balloting. It was nominated in two other categories _
single-camera editing and music composition for a miniseries or
special.
   The 40th annual Primetime Emmy Awards will be presented Aug. 28
and will be televised live by Fox Broadcasting.

   Whether he wins the November election or not,
George Bush is way ahead in one contest: Johnny Carson told more
jokes about him than any other political candidate in the first
half of 1988.
   Carson's monologues on ``The Tonight Show,'' considered one
indicator of what people outside politics are thinking, were
analyzed by Daniel Amundson and S. Robert Lichter.
   The two researchers, who also looked at comedian David
Letterman's monologues on ``Late Night,'' published their findings
on political humor in the magazine Public Opinion.
   ``Poor George Bush endured a veritable comedic vivisection,''
the pair wrote. ``The late-night hosts carved up his record, his
campaign tactics and his manhood.''
   Carson, on Bush's speaking ability: ``The last time George Bush
gave a speech someone came up and drew a chalk outline around his
body.''
   In Iowa: ``I think George Bush went too far when he stuffed
straw in his overalls and started to sing `If I Only Had A Brain.'''
   And during Super Tuesday season: ``Down South he went into a
truck stop wearing a pair of overalls, but he had a little
alligator sewn over the pocket.''
   Amundson and Lichter looked at the Carson and Letterman
monologues from Jan. 1 to June 7. They found that Carson was far
more political than Letterman and included jokes about at least one
candidate in nearly every new episode of his show.
   Bush's campaign manager, Lee Atwater, has said he pays close
attention to the Carson monologues ``as a barometer of how the
candidates play in the `real' America beyond the beltway,'' the
highway that encircles Washington, Lichter and Amundson said.
   And Atwater's not the only one.
   ``When Johnny Carson talks, candidates have to listen,'' says
Lichter. ``They listen to hear what America is hearing.''
   Republican contenders were the butt of Carson's jokes twice as
often as the Democrats, with Bush the target of 32 barbs followed
by Bob Dole with 18 and Pat Robertson with 17.
   On the Democratic side, Gary Hart attracted 15 jokes, Dick
Gephardt was the target of nine and Bruce Babbit drew five.
   The lower numbers for the Democrats ``reflect the writers strike
that put `The Tonight Show' on reruns during the peak of Democratic
campaigning in the Midwest and New York,'' the authors said. ``It
certainly doesn't mean they were any less laughable than the
Republicans.''
   The Hart jokes centered on his relationship with model Donna
Rice, starting in January when Carson remarked that ``Gary Hart
made a stunning statement today. He said if he was elected he would
not be the first adulterer in the White House, but he would be the
best.''
   Letterman got into the act, the researchers reported, on the day
President Reagan had his annual physical. ``Reagan says he has the
body of a 20-year-old _ which if I remember correctly is very much
like the Gary Hart campaign slogan,'' the comedian said.
   Amundson and Lichter said most of the jokes focused on gaffes
and personal foibles, Gephardt's appearance and ``the utter
hopelessness'' of Babbitt's quest.
   ``I'm not sure if I want a president who has to draw in his
face,'' Carson said after what the researchers called ``the
mysterious appearance'' of Gephardt's eyebrows before the Iowa
caucuses.
   And when Babbitt endorsed Michael Dukakis, Carson cracked,
``Babbitt lending support to Dukakis is like Sandy Duncan lending
her bra to Oprah Winfrey.''
   Carson disputed Robertson's claim that Planned Parenthood was
formed to create a master race. Obviously that's not true, Carson
said, or we'd have a better class of presidential candidates.
   Conspicuously absent from the barrage of quips was Democratic
nominee Dukakis, a straight-laced candidate. Lichter said he and
Amundson are thinking of continuing their survey through the
general election campaign ``just to see if Johnny Carson can find
something funny about Mike Dukakis.''

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet astronomers are proposing an orbiting,
100-ton ``superobservatory,'' more massive than anything planned in
the West, to be launched late in this century.
   Nikolai S. Kardashev, a member of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, said Tuesday that preliminary engineering studies of the
superobservatory envision three powerful instruments to gain
unprecedented views of the heavens.
   In an interview at the 20th assembly of the International
Astronomical Union, Kardashev said plans call for parts of the
observatory to be sent into Earth orbit aboard the Soviet's
powerful Energia rocket.
   The observatory would be assembled in orbit ``either by robots
or by astronauts and cosmonauts,'' he said.
   A second rocket then would send the observatory to the so-called
Lagrangian point L-2 about 900,000 miles from Earth where the
gravitational attraction of the Earth, moon and sun balance each
other. An object left in L-2 would remain at that point.
   ``This would give a very high resolution of the whole
universe,'' said Kardashev. He said the sun, Earth and moon would
be visible at all times from L-2 in one direction, while the rest
of the universe could be seen by pointing instruments outward, away
from the sun.
   An observatory at L-2 would orbit the sun in about the same
period as the Earth.
   Kardashev said instruments proposed for the observatory are an
X-ray and gamma-ray detector, a 400-meter radio telescope and a
10-meter optical telescope.
   The optical telescope would be about four times more powerful
than the $1 billion space telescope planned for launch next year by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Kardashev said observation data collected by the instruments
would be sent by radio signals to ground stations or satellites,
and the observatory would be able to operate around the clock.
   ``This would be a very big project and we are very interested in
international cooperation,'' he said.
   Kardashev said the cost would be ``one billion rubles or
dollars'' but American astronomers say a project of the scale
decribed by the Soviets would cost must more than that.
   The Soviet scientist said it is believed that if the project is
started soon, it would be ready for launch by the year 2000.
   The Soviets said in a statement the superobservatory ``can only
be realized in the context of broad, international collaboration.''
   ``We herewith invite all interested parties to contact us at
their earliest convenience,'' the announcement said.

   White House officials prepared today to
announce a successor to Education Secretary William Bennett amid
indications the job will go to Lauro Cavazos, president of Texas
Tech University, who could become the first Hispanic Cabinet member.
   Administration officials would not discuss plans to announce the
choice to succeed Bennett, who announced in May that he wished to
leave the administration by around mid-September.
   Nor would officials confirm that Cavazos was set to be nominated
for the post, although it was learned that the 61-year-old college
president had traveled from the Texas Tech campus in Lubbock to the
nation's capital.
   Cavazos had been scheduled to appear today at a meeting of Tech
officials and representatives of the state Legislative Budget Board
and the Governor's Budget Office, but did not attend that meeting.
   Neither Bennett nor Cavazos could immediately be reached for
comment.
   Loye Miller, a spokesman for Bennett, declined to comment.
   The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal had quoted sources as saying that
Cavazos was being considered for the job.
   The newspaper said today that it was told by sources in
Washington that Cavazos was ``on a very short list'' of candidates.
   Cavazos, who has served as Tech's president since April 1980,
received the National Hispanic Leadership award of the League of
United Latin American Citizens in July for his work in education.
He was cited for his efforts to reduce the dropout rate among
Hispanic youth.
   Several Lubbock residents told the newspaper that they had been
contacted in the last few days by federal agents conducting a
background check on Cavazos. They were not given reasons for the
queries, which are a routine part of the appointment process.
   Cavazos' possible selection might be considered an effort by
Republicans to court the Hispanic vote in South Texas since he is a
native of that area and a son of a foreman of the Santa Gertrudis
Division of the storied King Ranch.
   Cavazos announced in May that he would resign as president of
Texas Tech in July 1989 and, after a leave, return to teach anatomy
in the medical school, where he has tenure.

<HEAD>Disappointed South Koreans Will Meet North Koreans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean officials, disappointed
that North Korea rejected a proposal to work out details for
full-scale negotiations, said they will agree to a meeting on the
communist nation's demand to be co-host of the Olympics, sources
said Tuesday.
   A North Korean letter delivered Tuesday said there was not
enough time to hold ``a preliminary contact and then the full talks
under the present condition where 40 days ... are left until the
opening of the Olympic Games that must be debated as an urgent
agenda item.''
   The Olympic Games start Sept. 17 in Seoul and North Korea has
said it will boycott unless it can be co-host. The International
Olympic Committee refused that demand and said the Olympics are
awarded to a city, not a country.
   The letter from Yang Hyong Sop, chairman of the rubberstamp
Supreme People's Assembly, called for a meeting in Panmunjom on
Aug. 17 that would be limited to discussing logistical
arrangements, with a first full parliamentary meeting to be held in
its capital of Pyongyang on Aug. 26.
   South Korean had called for detailed preliminary talks on
working out an agenda for full-scale negotiations.
   The North Korean letter was addressed to South Korean National
Assembly speaker Kim Chae-sun and delivered at the border truce
site of Panmunjom.
   ``The Aug. 17 meeting is expected to come off as proposed by the
North, but the overall picture of the situation is rather
disappointing,'' said one source at the National Assembly, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A few hours after the North Korean letter was delivered,
political party leaders met and said they would send a reply by the
end of this week.
   Lee Dong-bok, chief secretary to the Assembly speaker, said
after the meeting that a notable feature of North Korea's letter is
its stress on the inclusion of ``personages of various parties,
organizations and circles'' as full members of the proposed
parliamentary talks.
   The Hankook Ilbo, a mass-circulation national daily, said, ``Any
agreement can hardly be expected, because (North Korea) insists on
including ``personages of parties, organizations and circles,''
Pyongyang's reference to dissident groups in South Korea.
   Sources in the National Assembly said the tone of the North
Korean letter is not conciliatory and is rather ``rude,'' in sharp
contrast with North Korean proposals in the past.
   ``Dialogue may be opened, but the real fruit of the
parliamentary talks can hardly expected,'' The Chosun Ilbo, an
influential national newspaper, said in a commentary.
   Hankook said North Korea appears to be eager to find a new
excuse to boycott the Olympic Games by making demands South Korea
can hardly accept.
   Both papers noted that North Korea said the talks were urgent
while proposing Aug. 17 as a meeting date. South Korea had earlier
suggested a meeting begin Aug. 11.
   The papers also noted that the date is two days after Aug. 15,
when South Korean radical students plan to march to the border for
talks with North Korean youths on national unfication.
   ``It is obvious that all this is intended to stir unrest in our
society,'' Hankook said.
   South Korea fears the north may use terrorism to try and disrupt
the Olympics. North Korea was implicated in the Nov. 29 bombing of
a South Korean airliner with the deaths of all 115 people aboard.
   Most observers believe there is little chance North Korea will
drop its demand to be co-host of the Olympics and agree to take
part. Such a change would represent a total turnabout after 40
years of bitter rivalry.
   North Korea sees the holding of the Olympics in Seoul as a major
political defeat since both sides claim to be the sole legitimate
government on the Korean peninsula.
   North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950 to start the Korean War.
The two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was
signed when an armistice halted fighting in 1953.

<HEAD>Official Mine Wage Protest Fails To Materialize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Work went on uninterrupted Tuesday in a
copper mine complex despite a call by the industry's official union
for a brief wage protest there.
   There were conflicting explanations on why the protest did not
take place and about recent developments at the Rudna mine.
   Government officials said the protest was called off by leaders
of the local, officially recognized copper union after they
received a telegram from the Industry Ministry proposing talks.
   Officials of the banned Solidarity trade union, which had urged
workers to ignore the call, said miners simply refused to go along
with the protest.
   Solidarity officials asked miners to reject the call because the
protest focused on wage issues and not safety demands, which the
banned union maintains are at the core of disputes with mine
management.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Tuesday the official union
called off the protest after receiving the ministry telegram.
   Local Solidarity spokesman Jan Sugalski said the official union
had gone ahead with the protest action, trying to turn off conveyor
belts to force a work stoppage. Sugalski said miners refused to
carry out the orders.
   The local copper workers' union, part of the national federation
of trade unions, on Monday distributed an appeal calling for a
one-to two-hour work stoppage in the copper mining industries of
lower Silesia, said Solidarity advisor Jacek Kuron.
   Kuron said the official union's failure to mention safety
conditions amounted to an attempt to thwart Solidarity-led efforts
to bring changes to the industry.
   He said the wage issue is secondary to safety demands because
management has shown a willingness to meet pay demands.
   The action by the official union appeared designed to head off
protests by Solidarity supporters at the Rudna mine, outside the
town of Lubin.
   An independent mining commission at the Rudna mine has charged
that miners must work at temperatures that exceed industry norms.
   The miners have given management until Aug. 15 to adhere to an
earlier agreement to improve working conditions.
   They threatened protest actions if management did not comply.

<HEAD>Falling Water Levels Force Restrictions On Montana Trout Streams</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB ANEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Montana's Fish and Game Commission has
adopted emergency fishing regulations to help preserve trout
endangered by dwindling water in many drought-ravaged streams and
rivers.
   The commission's action is a ``good start,'' said Stan Bradshaw,
spokesman for the Montana chapter of Trout Unlimited. ``It's a
recognition, at least, that times are tough.''
   In a related action, the commission agreed with a Department of
Fish, Wildlife and Parks proposal to make more antelope, deer and
elk permits available this year in many hunting districts.
   A low harvest last year, combined with drought-withered forage
available for this winter, convinced the commissioners that hunters
should be given a chance to harvest game before the animals starve.
   The fishing restrictions, which take effect Friday and will last
at least through February, apply to most trout streams east of the
Rocky Mountains and a few in western Montana, the commission said
Monday.
   Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks personnel said this is
the first time the commission has been forced to take emergency
steps to deal with a drought's impacts on fisheries.
   Most seriously affected by the changes will be the central
fishing district, where limits will be reduced from five trout to
two trout on most waterways.
   ``Most of the rivers and streams in the district are at or near
record low flows for this time of year,'' Pat Graham, chief of the
Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks' Fisheries Division, told
the commission. ``The situation is bad and getting worse, and we
have to do what we can to protect the state's wild trout fishery.
   ``At this point, rain is not going to solve the problem. If more
trout begin to die as a result of the low stream flows and high
water temperatures, the detrimental impacts on the fisheries will
be apparent for several years.''
   Graham noted that his agency does not stock streams with
hatchery fish, so ``the imposition of emergency restrictions is the
only way we can offer protection to the wild trout in these streams
that will spawn in the fall and spring.''
   ``We depend on wild rainbow and brown trout to maintain our fish
populations,'' Graham said.
   If water levels continue to decline, fishing bans in key
spawning areas may be requested at the commission's September
meeting, he warned.

<HEAD>Catholics, Fundamentalists Arrayed Against Movie on Jesus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with statement today by U.S. Catholic
Conference. No Pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Catholic Conference said today it
will urge Catholics not to see the film ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' while two fundamentalist preachers complained they were
turned away from screenings.
   The conference rated the film ``morally offensive'' to the
nation's 53 million Catholics and said it was theologically flawed.
   Although a memo to the bishops said the film is ``clearly
contrary to the teachings of the church,'' it said public protests
against the film would give the film further publicity.
   The two Protestant preachers, the Revs. Donald Wildmon and Jerry
Falwell, have been critical of the film, although neither has seen
it.
   An 18-member of the Catholic group saw the film at a screening
Monday, the Buffalo (N.Y.) News reported today.
   Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film depicts Jesus as someone
who is tempted to resist what Christians believe is his divinity,
until the point of death on the cross. Jesus hallucinates during a
dream sequence in the movie that he marries and has sex with Mary
Magdelene.
   In the face of protests from religious groups, Universal
Pictures announced the film, based on a novel by the Greek author
Nikos Kazantzakis, would open Friday, more than a month ahead of
schedule. The studio has been previewing the film this week.
   The cast includes Willem Dafoe (``Platoon'') as Jesus, Barbara
Hershey (``Hannah and Her Sisters'') as Mary Magdalene and rock
star David Bowie as Pontius Pilate.
   In the memo released in Washington, the conference said the
movie dwells on sexual rather than spiritual love and contains
excessive graphic violence.
   The conference suggested the church use the issuance of the film
``as an opportunity to place before our people again the true image
of Christ.''
   Universal turned down a request by Wildmon, a United Methodist
minister, who heads the American Family Association in Tupelo,
Miss., to see a preview scheduled to be held in New York today, the
minister's group said. It also withdrew an invitation to Falwell
for a Wednesday screening there, according to a Falwell spokesman.
   Wildmon was turned away ``because you have chosen to speak out
against MCA Inc. and Universal Pictures with regard to the film
without seeing it, and because you rejected our earlier offer to
see the film on July 12,'' said a letter from Universal.
   The studio noted Falwell's criticism in withdrawing its
invitation to him, said Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss. The former
Moral Majority leader has joined other ministers in calling for a
boycott of MCA and its subsidiaries.
   Wildmon refused Monday to apologize for condemning the film and
accused the studio of hypocrisy.

   Thousands of Burmese demonstrated
against President Sein Lwin on Tuesday and troops opened fire,
killing at least 36 people in Rangoon and 26 other cities,
officials and diplomats reported.
   Some diplomats said hundreds may have been killed or wounded in
Rangoon, where soldiers fired into crowds with shotguns and other
weapons. A U.S. official in Washington quoted witnesses as saying
protesters marched through the streets of Rangoon carrying bodies
of dead comrades over their heads.
   Rangoon radio said five people were killed and 55 wounded in the
capital, and the toll was 31 dead and 37 wounded at Sagaing in
central Burma, where 5,000 people tried to overrun a police
station. It said the casualty count was continuing.
   Military authorities imposed an 8 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew on
Rangoon's 3.5 million people. Martial law was declared in the
capital after a student protest march Aug. 3.
   Unusually detailed reports by the state radio said security
forces were forced to shoot on four occasions Tuesday and arrested
1,451 ``looters and disturbance makers.'' Whether that figure
include more than 800 arrests announced earlier was not clear.
   It named 26 towns and cities besides Rangoon where protests
occurred, including Mandalay, which is Burma's seconden shut since student
riots in June.
   James Cole, a 27-year-old Australian architect who arrived in
Bangkok from Rangoon, described the scene Tuesday as ``a game of
cat and mouse'' in which ``the army was chasing.''
   He reported seeing up to 600 soldiers, some with machine guns,
at Shwedagon Pagoda, one of the main sites of recent
anti-government protests.
   Cole said parts of the city were cordoned off with barricades
and roadblocks manned by soldiers. On a drive from Mandalay to
Rangoon, the Australian said, he saw six armored cars and up to 20
truckloads of troops heading for the capital.
   Jim Hanson, a 25-year-old American, said most stores were closed
and no buses ran. ``There was a lot of public support for the
demonstrators,`` he said.
   Another tourist said people in some homes cooked food for the
protesters.
   A Western diplomat in Bangkok said, speaking privately: ``This
is a tragedy. Our reports say the crowds have been very
conciliatory (towards security forces). Things are going from bad
to worse.''
   The demonstrations, which began to spread beyond Rangoon on
Monday, are by far the largest show of protest since democracy was
ended in this Southeast Asian nation by a military coup in 1962
that brought Ne Win to power.
   Sein Lwin, a former general, became president and head of the
ruling party when Ne Win stepped down last month. Students accuse
him of the bloody suppression of riots in March and June.
   Diplomats said most protests in Rangoon have occurred at the
Sule Pagoda and Maha Bandoola Square downtown and at the hilltop
Shwedagon Pagoda in the northern suburbs.
   Burmese embassies have tried to screen out journalists applying
for tourist visas. The Associated Press has been unable to enter
the country and its Rangoon correspondent, Sein Win, was arrested
last month along with several critics of the government.
   Travelers from Rangoon in recent days have quoted Burmese as
saying Sein Lwin was the most hated man in the country.
   Ne Win had full support from the officer corps, but most
analysts believe loyalty to Sein Lwin is only partial. Some feel
that could have more bearing on Burma's future than riots by
unarmed students.

<HEAD>Reagan Film Again Causes Concerns for Networks at GOP Convention</HEAD>

   Reagan II, the movie, is already causing some
concern for networks that got caught in a film controversy at the
Republican National Convention four years ago.
   Despite some grumbling after this year's Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, the three big networks will give the
Republicans equal time for the four-day GOP convention next week in
New Orleans, though with smaller staffs.
   A filmed tribute to the outgoing president is on the program
Monday, and Vice President George Bush, the expected nominee, will
be featured in another film Thursday.
   ``I'm still waiting for something definitive from the party on
the length,'' said Joe Angotti, executive producer of NBC's
convention coverage. ``There is a Reagan film which I don't feel
obligated to carry, because Reagan is not a candidate.''
   When Reagan was a candidate, in 1984, the three networks parted
company on carrying the 18-minute promotional film shown to the
convention. NBC and CNN carried it all, ABC carried excerpts and
CBS used the time during the film to show its own report on the
Reagan administration's successes and failures.
   This time, CBS may cover the film as a news story, ``using the
journalistic standards we use for other stories,'' executive
producer Lane Venardos said from New Orleans.
   ``We'll have to see it before deciding,'' said Jeff Gralnick,
executive producer for ABC.
   At the Democratic convention, CBS decided not to carry a
six-minute film about presidential nominee Michael Dukakis, filling
the time with commentary and a commercial. ABC, NBC and CNN all
carried that film.
   As of Monday, it wasn't even certain how long the Reagan and
Bush films would run _ Venardos said he had been told that Reagan's
film ran 18 minutes and Bush's 12 minutes, while Angotti said he
had been told that each ran about 20 to 25 minutes.
   During the Democratic convention, ABC News president Roone
Arledge had complained that the carefully orchestrated proceedings
were ``driving people at home not to watch,'' and raised the
possibility of cutting back coverage of the GOP event.
   However, ABC will join NBC and CBS in giving the Republicans an
equal two-hour block of prime time Monday through Thursday, from 9
to 11 p.m. EDT. The Republicans have scheduled some nights to run
past 11 p.m., including the roll call which will nominate Bush as
the party's presidential candidate.
   Venardos said CBS will stay with the roll call at least until
Bush has secured the nomination _ which is expected to be when
Texas casts its votes.
   ``That is really why we are here,'' Venardos said. ``I think
viewers care a lot about seeing and hearing their home state.''
   ``I think you have to play these things by ear,'' Angotti said.
``The more you say in advance about what you might do or not do,
the more trouble you get into.''
   ``From this vantage point, I will say exactly what I said before
Atlanta _ our plans are for 9-11 p.m. We haven't seen a schedule
which tells us what we need to know to make precise plans,''
Gralnick said.
   All three networks will use fewer people to cover the
Republicans than they deployed in Atlanta, and all said that's at
least partly because Republicans have no one comparable to Jesse
Jackson, who was still in the presidential race in Atlanta and made
noises about challenging for the vice-presidential slot.
   ABC is cutting 100 from its staff, CBS is paring 50 and NBC
plans to cut 25 to 30. They will still send hundreds.
   ``We had more delegate reporters last time than we are going to
have here,'' Angotti said from New Orleans. ``We're going to rely
more with our affiliates who are with the delegations to come up
with whatever news there is.''
   Venardos said the smaller staff also reflected ``things we
learned to do more efficiently in Atlanta. ... It wasn't so much
coverage, as how to schedule people more efficiently.''
   ABC is economizing by not taking ``Nightline'' to New Orleans,
and is using one control room instead of two.
   ``It's due to the fact that it's a one-candidate convention,''
Gralnick said. ``There are fewer hotels to cover, fewer candidate
possibiliies, less of a breaking news situation than in Atlanta.''
   Cable News Network plans no cut in its staff of nearly 300, said
network spokesman Kitsie Bassett, and no reduction in coverage time
which extended nearly 70 hours during the Democratic convention.
   CNN will go live at 11 a.m. Monday for the first convention
session.
   With the presidential nomination locked up, the Bush campaign is
banking on the vice presidency to boost ratings. Bush has said he
will not announce his choice until the convention's final day.
   ``I'm for doing anything that will help build a TV audience,''
Lee Atwater, Bush's campaign manager, said Monday.
   The Democratic convention was watched, on average, by less than
a fourth of the nation's homes with television. NBC did best with
an average rating of 7.4, while ABC had 6.9, CBS had 6.5 and CNN
had an average of 2.0 for the evening prime-time hours.
   Each rating point represents 1 percent of the nation's 88.6
million homes with TV.

   Soviet officials Tuesday began
counting U.S. cruise missiles at two sites in Belgium as part of
inspections allowed under the superpower arms treaty.
   The first team of 10 Soviet inspectors arrived by bus at the
European Repair Facility at Gosselies, about 30 miles south of
Brussels, to check missiles at a maintenance site.
   They paused for photographs and then went quickly into a
one-story building that is part of the operations run by the
Belgian defense contractor Sabca.
   ``It's a straightforward kind of process,'' said U.S. Embassy
spokesman James Findley. ``This is bean-counting, going in and
looking at what the treaty says are limited and figuring it out.''
   The Soviets, he said, would have a chance to measure unarmed
cruise missiles removed from their canisters for repair or
maintenance.
   ``They may take special measurements and check because this is
the only place they can do it,'' Findley said.
   There was no indication how many missiles were at the facility,
the only one of its kind in Europe set up to maintain and repair
the weapons.
   The number can vary daily. On June 21, there were 55 missiles at
the plant, according to U.S. officials.
   A second team of 10 inspectors went to Florennes Air Base, 10
miles north of the repair facility.
   Sixteen ground-launched cruise missiles and four spares are kept
at the base along with four launchers and eight spares, according
to U.S. officials.
   The sleek, ground-hugging weapons, which arrived in March 1985,
are jet-propelled, winged missiles with advanced guidance systems.
They are 21 feet long.
   The Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty provides the Soviet
Union and the United States with unprecedented review of each
other's facilities.
   The Soviets are visiting 30 sites in the United States and five
Western European countries. U.S. experts are inspecting 133 sites
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Each inspection can last up to 24 hours, with a possible
eight-hour extension.
   The Soviet experts, who arrived Monday, spent the night in a
Brussels hotel and notified authorities Tuesday that they wanted to
inspect the two sites.
   They were expected to spend Tuesday night at the facilities and
return to Brussels on Wednesday. They will leave Belgium later
Wednesday or Thursday.
   The Soviets were taken on a two-hour bus tour of the historic
capital with U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. David MacNamee. He said they
expressed interest in the Gothic and Baroque architecture.
   Belgium is the fourth Western European country visited by the
Soviet teams since the 60-day inspection process began July 1. They
have visited Germany, Britain and the Netherlands. They have yet to
inspect sites in Italy.
   The treaty provides for elimination within three years of all
U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges from about 300 to
3,400 miles. President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev signed the treaty in December in Washington.

   Lewis from the Bronx, Clint and Anna from
Minneapolis, and Herb from rural Kentucky have two things in
common: Each is young, and each has struggled with illiteracy.
   Now, with the help of a new series of public service television
announcements, they may well become celebrities, symbols of a new
literacy campaign stressing youth problems being jointly launched
by ABC television network and the Public Broadcasting System.
   The yearlong campaign, called Youth@PLUS, was first announced in
April, and ABC and PBS began broadcasting public service
announcements last month.
   James Duffy, president of communications of Capital Cities@ABC,
told reporters Tuesday that several new 30- and 60-second spots
will be shown starting September.
   The public service messages, Duffy said, will stress the
connection between illiteracy and youth problems including teen-age
pregnancy, unemployment, delinquency and substance abuse.
   Each spot, he said, feature a youngster telling his or her story
of how such problems contributed to their inability to read.
   Beginning in October, the networks will broadcast an additional
series of spots celebrating families that read together, and PBS
will broadcast a documentary on family reading, ``First Things
First,'' on Oct. 19.
   In January, a final set of public service announcements will
focus on ``unsung Americans'' who have done local illiteracy
volunteer work.
   PLUS, or Project Literacy U.S., was first launched by ABC and
PBS in 1985 and focused primarily on adult non-readers, Duffy said.

<HEAD>Governors' Meeting Erupts In Debate over Constitutional Amendments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's governors, after three days of
harmony, closed out their annual meeting Tuesday with an
acrimonious debate over whether to change the method of amending
the U.S. Constitution.
   Present but not participating in that debate, was Gov. Michael
Dukakis of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee, who
attended only the final session of the 80th meeting of the National
Governors Association.
   The Massachusetts governor sat silent while Govs. John Sununu of
New Hampshire and Mario Cuomo of New York, Buddy Roemer of Lousiana
and Carroll Campbell of South Carolina dropped all pretense of
harmony.
   ``You've turned the Constitution on its head,'' said Roemer.
   When Sununu, presiding over the final session of his year as NGA
chairman, suggested to Cuomo that they debate the issue on
television, the New York governor replied, ``I know how eager you
are for the (camera's) red light, Governor Sununu.''
   ``And I know how eager you are to avoid it,'' retorted Sununu.
   There was minimal debate and no roll call votes as the governors
quickly approved policy positions on issues ranging from housing
and jobs to transportation and tourism.
   Also approved on a voice vote was a call by the governors to
Congress to consider amending the Constitution to provide that if
34 states agreed on a constitutional amendment, it would be
submitted to Congress, which could block it by a two-thirds vote or
send it back to the states for ratification.
   Currently, amendments may be proposed by a vote of two-thirds of
each house of Congress or by a national convention called by
Congress. Amendments become part of the Constitution after
ratification by legislatures of three-fourths of the states or by
conventions in three-fourths of the states. Congress decides which
form of ratification should be used. State legislatures or
conventions are given seven years in which to ratify most
amendments.
   Many state legislatures have adopted resolutions calling for a
constitutional convention to consider an amendment to require a
balanced federal budget, but the number has fallen short of that
required to force convening of a convention.
   After the voice vote approving the proposal dealing with
constitutional amendments, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado said the
proposal ``divisive and contentious'' and asked Sununu to refer it
to the NGA executive committee for further consideration.
   The discussion grew a little more heated when Cuomo, conceding
he had not objected before the vote, denounced the proposal as ``a
half-baked notion.''
   Cuomo had not attended the first three days of the conference
and Campbell noted that ``some of us have been here for the entire
conference; some of us came in only for the last show.''
   The debate finally was resolved when Sununu suggested that all
governors put their views of the proposal in writing and promised
to attach them to the resolution when it was submitted to Congress.
   Dukakis took part in a light moment at the close of the meeting,
when he and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas stepped to the podium to
make a presentation to Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, who will be
the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention next week
in New Orleans.
   Throughout the NGA meeting, governors needled Clinton about his
overly long speech at the Democratic convention.
   Dukakis turned to Kean and presented him with a plastic shopping
bag and said, ``Just in case you have the same kind of problem he
(Clinton) did, we thought you might want to take this.''
   Inside the bag was an hour glass.

   Greece will boycott autumn NATO maneuvers
in the Aegean Sea but will join another alliance exercise in
Western Europe, the government said Tuesday.
   ``According to the government's firm policy, Greek forces do not
take part in (NATO) exercises in the Aegean,'' said government
spokesman Sotiris Kostopoulos.
   He said Greece won't participate in the ``Display Determination
88'' maneuvers in the eastern Mediterranean this fall.
   But Greece will take part in the ``Autumn Forge 88'' exercises
since ``our armed forces do participate from time to time in
bilateral and multilateral technical exercises on a smaller scale
being carried out outside the Aegean,'' Kostopoulos said.
   Since 1981, Greece has refused to participate in NATO exercises
in the Aegean, saying the alliance favors Turkey by excluding the
Greek island of Lemnos from the exercise scenarios.
   Turkey claims that Lemnos should not be militarized, citing the
1923 Lausanne Treaty. Greece maintains the 1936 Montreux Convention
superseded the earlier treaty and allows military installations on
the northern Aegean island.
   Greece and Turkey have a long feud over military control of the
Aegean Sea region.

first sight is possible.
   She and Chris Quinten, an actor on the English soap opera

two months ago in New Zealand.
   ``I never believed in this love-at-first-sight thing. But I'm a

   ``We've both spent a decade or more in the fast lane. We've been
exposed to the most eligible people in the world. I think we
know,'' Ms. Gibbons, a South Carolina native, said Monday in a
telephone interview with The Columbia State from her Los Angeles
office.
   She said the wedding will take place ``somewhere in Europe.''
   ``I certainly don't expect my father to throw a big, lavish
wedding,'' said Ms. Gibbons, 31, who previously was married for
three years.
   She said she wasn't sure where the couple would work. ``I don't
want to have a transcontinental relationship. That doesn't make

   Actor Rex Harrison has made a triumphant return to
the London stage after a four-year absence.
   The 80-year-old Harrison won a rousing ovation Monday from the
first-night audience for his portrayal of the Earl of Loam in a
revival of J.M. Barrie's comedy of manners ``The Admirable
Crichton.''
   Harrison was last on the London stage in 1984 in Frederick
Lonsdale's ``Aren't We All'' with Claudette Colbert.
   He will play eight shows a week in ``The Admirable Crichton.''
The play is about a butler who reverses the roles of master and
servant with the earl when the household end up on a desert island.
   One of Harrison's best-remembered roles is Professor Henry
Higgins in the London and Broadway productions of ``My Fair Lady''
more than 20 years ago.
   Actor Jeremy Irons, who was in the audience Monday, said: ``I
would like to be on that stage when I am 80. Harrison is a
charismatic performer and I greatly admire him because he has a
multitude of tricks up his sleeve.''
   Edward Fox, who plays the butler Crichton, said: ``Playing Rex's
role requires a lot of stamina. He has enormous grit and
determination.''

   A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit in
which actress Ginger Rogers accused Italian filmmakers of invading
her privacy in the movie ``Ginger and Fred.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet ruled Monday that the Federico
Fellini film was artistic expression that ``enjoys the full
protection of the First Amendment.''
   Miss Rogers, 77, famous for the musicals in which she danced
with Fred Astaire in the 1930s, filed suit in March 1986 against
the producer, Alberto Grimaldi, and the distributor, MGM-United
Artists. Her complaint seeking $8 million alleged the movie
depicted her in a false light and infringed on her ``public
personality.''
   The movie, starring Marcello Mastroianni and Giulietta Masina,
is about the reunion of two aging Italian music hall dancers who
once were popular for imitating Astaire and Miss Rogers.

<HEAD>Gasoline Prices Too High, Consumer Group Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group accused oil companies Tuesday
of pocketing the savings from lower crude oil prices instead of
passing them along to motorists in the form of lower gasoline
prices.
   ``Instead of passing on lower prices to consumers, major oil
companies are increasing their profits,'' said Ed Rothschild,
assistant director of the Citizen-Labor Energy Coalition.
   Edward Murphy, director of finance, accounting and statistics
for the American Petroleum Institute, denied the charge.
   ``The idea that the oil companies are colluding to keep the
prices up is just pure garbage,'' Murphy said. ``There is
absolutely no evidence that that is the case.''
   The consumer group released a study of oil and gasoline prices
compiled from a variety of sources including the Energy Information
Administration, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics
and Oil Daily.
   ``Oil companies reduced inventories at the beginning of the
summer and kept gasoline production low in order to limit supplies
and raise prices,'' Rothschild said.
   He said that while the price of crude oil fell from 38 cents a
gallon in January to 35 cents in July, retail gasoline prices rose
from $1.09 to $1.13.
   Rothschild added that many companies chose to emphasize
production of their highest octane and most profitable gasoline,
which also had the effect of increasing prices.
   Murphy replied that there is always a lag between crude prices
and the price charged at the pump. Gasoline prices didn't rise last
year until two months or more after increases in crude costs, he
said, and the same lag is occurring this year with crude oil
declines.
   Murphy said that as of May 1, gasoline stocks totaled 225
million barrels, 10 million barrels lass that a year earlier but
somewhat more than the two prior years.

   President and Mrs. Reagan presented the
National Medal of Arts to 12 luminaries of the arts on Tuesday.
``The right to sing your own song is the promise and glory of
America,'' Reagan said.
   It was the fourth time the medals have been awarded since they
were created by Congress in 1984 on Reagan's recommendation.
   The winners were:
   _Novelist Saul Bellow, 73, whose writings have won him the Nobel
Prize for Literature, the Pulitzer Prize and three National Book
Awards.
   _Actress Helen Hayes, 87, who first appeared on stage at the age

<HEAD>For $5, Folks Learn What Their Family Treasures Are Worth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art appraisers Stacey Roman and Phillip
Jelley were in town anyway for an auction of works from two failed
banks, so folks at the Anchorage Museum of History and Art figured
they'd use their services for a fund-raiser.
   For a $5 donation to the museum, people were invited to bring in
their family treasures Monday and find out from the experts what
they were really worth. There were no major finds and a lot of
disappointment as the appraisers spent five hours reviewing a host
of objets d'art, but a few people learned their pieces were at
least good buys.
   Roman said he mostly examined ``a lot of photo reproductions ..
. a lot of decorative pieces,'' and said things like, ``It would
cost you more to get it framed than it's worth.''
   He said he developed the phrase ``decorative piece'' because
``it's better than telling somebody it's a piece of junk. ... Just
because it doesn't have a lot of value doesn't mean it doesn't have
sentimental value.''
   Roman and Jelley work for the California-based art auction house
of Butterfield & Butterfield, and the main purpose of their visit
is Wednesday night's auction of a collection acquired by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as a result of its takeover of two
failed Alaska banks.
   The collection includes a huge Sydney Laurence rendition of
Mount McKinley, valued $180,000 to $220,000, and some other works
valued at more than $10,000.
   ``Literally, it's a treasure hunt,'' Roman said. He is director
of the auction house's painting department and his hope was to
unearth paintings worth shipping to California for sale.
   Butterfield & Butterfield charges commissions ranging from 35
percent for items that sell for $100 or less, to 10 percent for
pieces sold for $5,000 or more.
   ``Basically, my job is to look at beautiful things all day,''
Roman said. And every day hope springs anew that someone will pull
out of a plastic bag ``some amazing painting that's never been seen
in 100 years.''
   But it was not to be Monday.
   Jelley said he saw ``a nice little rug and a cast bronze bust,''
but the only thing perhaps worth shipping to San Francisco was a
silver tea set he plans to research some more.
   Other items produced included a large parchment page of
Gregorian chant, brought back from Europe after World War II, whose
owner believed it dated from the Middle Ages; a Hungarian mirror
painting _ a religious scene purchased 21 years ago for $20 in a
Budapest antique shop; and a sealed bottle of Old Mr. Boston
Straight Rye Whisky from the Prohibition era.
   The parchment, it turned out, was probably 19th-century and not
worth much.
   But the Hungarian mirror painting was definitely a good buy. It
would probably bring about $600 at auction, Jelley told its owner,
who had talked her way past Hungarian border guards when they
questioned whether she should be allowed to take the painting out
of their country.
   The whiskey too had no value at auction, because while wine can
be auctioned off, it is against the law to auction hard liquor.
   So what are Jorene and Shield Downey going to do with grandma's
medicinal pint, preserved so carefully all these years?
   ``Our anniversary is on Valentine's Day,'' Mrs. Downey said.
``We're going to drink it.''

<HEAD>Fed Tries To Dampen Inflation by Hiking Bank Lending Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board, in a move to fight
inflation, said Tuesday it was boosting its key bank lending rate
for the first time in nearly a year. Analysts said other interest
rates likely would head higher as a result.
   With only three months left before the presidential election,
the board members, all appointed by President Reagan, sent a
dramatic signal that they were willing to push up interest rates to
dampen inflationary pressures even at the risk of endangering Vice
President George Bush's presidential aspirations.
   The increase in the discount rate, from 6 percent to 6.5
percent, was adopted by a 6-0 vote and took effect immediately. It
was the first change since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest
in more than two years.
   An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the Fed
charges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank's
most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on
economic growth.
   Economists said jumps in other interest rates, including those
on mortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow.
   ``This will hit consumer pocketbooks fairly soon,'' said David
Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston, a government securities
dealer in New York.
   He said banks likely will raise their prime rate, the interest
they charge their most creditworthy commercial customers, this week
or next.
   Since May, banks have raised their prime rate by a full point to
9.5 percent, the highest since March 1986.
   And because more people are borrowing through home equity loans
and adjustable rate mortgages, which are tied to rate fluctuations,
consumers will feel the effects of the Fed's action much more
rapidly than in previous years, he said.
   Investors, particularly foreign investors, have been skeptical
that the Federal Reserve would have the stomach to make such a move
with the presidential election on the line.
   However, with this increase, Jones said, ``I think the Fed
proved beyond any reasonable doubt that it does have a backbone and
that it is willing to fight inflation even in an election year.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
the administration was disappointed with the increase, but he
refrained from criticizing Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
   ``We're always disappointed when interest rates go up, but we
understand there is a reason for it,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
``We think the Federal Reserve has done a good job. ... We think
the Fed's on the right course.''
   The board, in a statement, said its decision ``reflects the
intent of the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures.''
   Consumer prices, which rose 4.4 percent last year, are expected
to increase by more than 5 percent this year and perhaps more than
6 percent next year, analysts are predicting.
   By making it more expensive to borrow money, the Fed hopes to
check inflation by slowing consumer demand. High employment is
putting more dollars in the hands of consumers.
   At the same time, factories are operating at their highest
capacity levels in eight years. They are straining to produce
enough goods for both domestic buyers and foreigners, who have been
buying more U.S. products in response to the devaluation of the
dollar through the end of last year.
   The danger of accelerating inflation is present because too many
dollars are chasing too few goods.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., consulting firm, said the discount rate hike likely will
push the value of the dollar, which has been recovering since early
this year, still higher.
   That eventually could choke off the improvement in the U.S.
trade deficit by making American products more expensive overseas,
he said.
   Prices on both the stock and bond markets fell after the Fed's
announcement.
   Analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the money
supply this week, but most were expecting the Fed to make the less
dramatic move of pushing up the federal funds rate, the interest
banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   However, the Fed noted in its statement that the action it chose
``was taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates
over the discount rate.''
   Since early March, it had pushed the federal funds rate up by
more than a percentage point to 7.75 percent while keeping the
discount rate the same.
   Too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to try to
misuse the ``discount window'' by borrowing from the Fed and
lending to other banks at a profit.
   Tuesday's discount rate increase was the second rate hike since
Greenspan became Fed chairman a year ago. In September the central
bank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to 6 percent, the first
increase in three years.
   That move also was taken in response to inflationary fears, but
was later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to the
October stock market crash.
   After the crash, the Fed loosened money supplies again in
midwinter, when rising business inventories raised concern that the
economy was softening.
   Since then, however, government statistics have portrayed a
strong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation.
   Prior to September, the last increase in the discount rate had
come April 6, 1984, when the rate was boosted from 8.5 percent to 9
percent.
   The rate was then cut seven successive times, with the last
reduction on Aug. 20, 1986, when it dropped from 6 percent to 5.5
percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade.

<HEAD>Control Board Takes Control Of Yonkers</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARLENE AIG</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state board today assumed control of the
city's finances and threatened defiant council members with
criminal charges in an effort force them to accept a court-ordered
desegregation plan.
   ``In short, our goal is to save Yonkers from itself,'' said
Secretary of State Gail Shaffer, head of the Yonkers Emergency
Financial Control Board. The board voted 5-1 to impose a wage and
hiring freeze and made council members who refuse to obey rules for
fiscal responsibility subject to misdemeanor charges.
   The four council members who voted against the desegregation
plan ordered by U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand already are paying
fines and face a threat of imprisonment beginning Thursday on
Sand's contempt of court citation.
   The U.S. 2nd District Court of Appeals today said it would rule
on a city request to stay $500-a-day fines against the councilmen
and bankrupting fines against Yonkers. The panel did not say when
it would rule.
   The control board, established by Gov. Mario Cuomo earlier in
the decade when Yonkers came near bankruptcy, has sweeping powers
to control the budget of the state's fourth largest city. It could
remove the councilmen from office.
   City Manager Neil DeLuca cast the single negative vote because
``the control board is not strong enough at this time to avert
fiscal disaster... We may have to look to other entities to join me
in resolving this issue.''
   Mayor Nicholas Wasiscko, who has called a council meeting for
Wednesday night, said, ``The only thing that will make any
difference is the threat of removal'' from office.
   Sand fined the city $100 the first day, doubling daily so that
by day 22 the amount would have wiped out the city's $337 million
budget. DeLuca said the city would begin mass layoffs if the
situation was not resolved by Monday.
   Sand, who in 1985 found the city liable for intentionally
segregating its schools and housing over 40 years, found the city
and councilmen in contempt last week when the council voted 4-3
against a resolution supporting the construction of 800 units of
affordable housing throughout the city.
   Michael Sculnick, attorney for the city, asked the appellate
panel today to put the fines on hold pending a full appeal of
Sand's contempt order because if they continued, ``the city will be
bankrupt in less than two weeks.''
   Lawyers for the councilmen argued that Sand had exceeded his
authority by ordering passage of legislation that would implement
the housing plan. ``There are limits to a federal court's authority
even to remedy an unconstitutional action,'' said James D. Harmon,
attorney for Councilman Peter Chema.
   Michael Sussman, attorney for the National Assocation for the
Advancement of Colored People, contended that the appeals court had
a duty to Sand. ``The dignity of the federal court is under
assault,'' said Sussman, ``by a group of citizens who think they're
above the law.''
   DeLuca, who has pinpointed Aug. 21 as the last day the state's
fourth largest city can pay the price of defiance, said if the
appeals panel denied the stay, he would write to Sand asking him to
grant a stay himself and initiate round-the-clock negotiations to
resolve the crisis.
   But DeLuca said the city has about $66 million cash on hand and
the last day the city can pay a fine is Aug. 21, when the daily
fine is $26.1 million, but the cumulative fine would be $52.4
million.
   He said he still hoped Cuomo would intervene or that one of the
councilmen would change his vote.
   Sand had called for the governor's assistance, noting the
governor's power to remove elected officials. Cuomo has said he is
reluctant to do that because it would be complicated and the city
has appealed the contempt finding.
   Getting a councilman to change his vote would be difficult, too,
``because they're all heroes now,'' said DeLuca.
   The four, Vice Mayor Henry Spallone, Nicholas Longo, Chema and
Edward Fagan, may face additional financial pressure if a citizens'
group goes ahead and files a $100 million civil suit against them
for negligence, dereliction of duty, illegal conduct and waste.
   Thomas Dickerson, an attorney and vice president of Citizens and
Neighbors Organized to Protect Yonkers, said the four councilmen
had violated state law and the City Charter by their actions and
had caused the city irreparable harm publicly and financially.

   Eight drought-plagued rivers set records for
low water last month, including all-time records in South Carolina
and Wisconsin, the U.S. Geological Survey reported Tuesday.
   The North Fork of the Edisto River at Orangeburg, S.C., averaged
141 million gallons of water per day for the month, the least
amount of water for any month ever measured in that river in 49
years of recordkeeping.
   And on July 15 the Wisconsin River at Muscoda, Wis., recorded
its lowest one-day flow ever at 1.2 billion gallons. That river has
been measured for 75 years.
   Six other rivers, including the once mighty Mississippi, had
their lowest flows for any July on record, the survey reported.
   Even so, July had fewer record lows than the 33 recorded in June.
   ``Rains have brought some spotty improvement in streamflows and
reservoir levels around the country,'' reported James Ziglar,
assistant secretary of interior.
   But, he added, ``the overall water-resources situation remains
one of concern.''
   ``Perhaps most striking, the Mississippi River itself, pipeline
for nearly half the streamflow in the United States, set a new
monthly low, the lowest July in at least 54 years, and at least 13
percent lower than the record low set in June,'' Ziglar said.
   Flow in the Mississippi at Vicksburg, Miss., averaged 108
billion gallons per day during July, 60 percent below the median
for the month. That flow broke the previous low record of 119
billion gallons per day set in July 1934.
   That also meant the Mississippi remained the nation's second
largest river in July, trailing the St. Lawrence, which averaged
159 billion gallons per day at Massena, N.Y. That was 11 percent
below normal for the St. Lawrence.
   Water flows for the remainder of the nation's Big Five rivers in
July were 75.4 billion gallons per day in the Columbia River at The
Dalles, Ore., 58 percent below normal; 28.7 billion gallons a day
in the Missouri at Hermann, Mo., 41 percent below normal; and 19.8
billion in the Ohio at Louisville, Ky., 38 percent below normal.
   In addition to the record at Vicksburg, the Mississippi as
measured at Keokuk, Iowa, also set a record low for July at 10.6
billion gallons a day, 74 percent below normal.
   Besides the Mississippi, Edisto and Wisconsin rivers, records
for low July streamflows were set on:
   _The Chippewa River at Chippewa Falls, Wis., averaged 707
million gallons a day, 9 percent less than the record set in 1910.
The flow was 65 percent below normal for the month.
   _Altahama River at Doctortown, Ga., was 74 percent below normal
with a flow of 1.15 billion gallons per day, lowest in 56 years of
records.
   _The Apalachicola River at Chattahoochee, Fla., was the lowest
in 59 years of recordkeeping, with an average of 3.8 billion
gallons per day.
   _The Sturgeon River at Sidnaw, Mich., recorded a flow of only 5
million gallons per day, lowest in 47 years and 90 percent below
normal.
   _Oconto River at Gillette, Wis., had its lowest July in 76
years, averaging 149 million gallons per day, 47 percent below
normal.

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy Says Report of Baby Trafficking is False, Slanderous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy on Tuesday rejected
as false and slanderous a report that babies were sold to Americans
for adoption and then dismembered, with their hearts and livers
going to organ banks.
   ``There does not exist the slightest evidence ... that any
adopted infant from any part of the world has been used in that
way,'' the embassy said in a statement.
   The statement followed news reports that police raiding a house
last week found seven infants _ presumably born of Brazilian
mothers _ and several pregnant women who apparently intended to
give their babies up for adoption.
   The infants, aged three months to six months, were taken to a
hospital. Police detained three men and a woman.
   Judge Angel Campos denounced the international ``trafficking''
of infants, and speculated that some might be dismembered in the
United States for their organs, which could be sold for hundreds of
dollars.
   The embassy statement said a similar allegation was made in 1987
by Honduras' secretary-general of Social Welfare, Leonardo Villeda
Bermudez, who subsequently acknowledged he had no proof.
   The same allegation later cropped up in Guatemala, but that,
too, was false, the statement said, alleging that communist
newspapers were behind the rumor.

   The American Accordionists Association is
gathered for its 50th anniversary jubilee, and members say those
who only associate their instruments with old Lawrence Welk shows
are full of hot air.
   ``All people see on TV is accordions playing polkas, and they
think that's all the accordions can do,'' said Anthony Chism, a
25-year-old classical-accordion virtuoso from California. ``But
there's so much freedom with the sound. If you could see what's
going on with the air inside the accordion, it would boggle your
mind.''
   At least 1,000 accordionists gathered this week from around the
world for the convention.
   Music store owner Alex Carozza was ready to write off the
instrument in 1980, when it accounted for only 10 percent of his
store's sales.
   Now it accounts for 35 percent, he says.
   ``The young people are beginning to talk accordion again,'' said
Maddelena Belfiore, a New Jersey accordion teacher who is vice
president of the International Confederation of Accordionists.

<HEAD>6-Year-Old With AIDS To Join Classmates, But Stay Behind Partition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered school officials
to build a glass-front isolation booth inside a classroom so a
6-year-old who has AIDS can be taught with other children.
   The box, to measure at least 6 feet by 8 feet, is to have a desk
and a potty chair, a sound system and a full-time teacher's aide.
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich said in her ruling
Monday she took into consideration the concerns of all involved in
the case brought by the girl's adoptive mother, Rosa Martinez,
against the Hillsborough County School Board last September.
   The judge expressed hope that once Eliana Martinez is able to
see how her mentally handicapped schoolmates cope, she will become
toilet-trained and learn not to habitually place her thumb and
forefinger in her mouth.
   Once that happens, the ``remote theoretical possibility'' that
acquired immune deficiency syndrome could be spread to her
classmates will be so slight that she must be allowed to sit in the
classroom with her peers, the judge ruled.
   No AIDS cases have been proven to have been transmitted through
exposure to urine, feces or saliva even though the virus that
causes the disease has been found in these bodily secretions, the
judge wrote.
   Steve Hanlon, Eliana's lawyer, called the judge's ruling
``creative'' and said he hoped that within six weeks of starting
school Aug. 29, Eliana will have progressed enough to leave the
booth.
   But a school official labeled the chamber idea ``sadistic,'' and
compared it to child abuse.
   ``All I can do is see that little face in a bubble, very close
to other children, but not able to take part in what the other
children are doing,'' said Marion S. Rogers, a member of the
Hillsborough County School Board and a former teacher. ``I think I
feel that this is as close to child abuse as it can be.''
   Sam Rosales, head of the Classroom Teachers Association, said
Tuesday that teachers who are aware of the ruling have had
``basically a positive attitude, although slightly apprehensive.''
   Of the judge's decision, he said: ``I think she broke new
ground, but it's still a middle-of-the road ruling.''
   Ms. Martinez wanted her daughter schooled with other ``trainable
mentally handicapped'' children at Manhattan Exceptional Center,
saying Eliana needed the socialization and interaction.
   The school district wanted Eliana taught at home out of fear she
could transmit the AIDS virus. The girl has been in home
instruction since June 1987.
   Sam Rampello, vice chairman of the school board, said, ``What
the judge is asking us to do is unusual. But we're going to do it.
I'm not criticizing; I'm not praising. We have to take all the good
and all the problems that come with it, and all the consequences
that come with it.''
   Eliana is one of 500 children in a pilot pediatric AIDS program
who have been treated with experimental drugs including AZT.
   Kovachevich said Eliana's case of AIDS, probably contracted from
transfusions of contaminated blood after her premature birth in
Puerto Rico, is being held in check by the treatment.
   Kovachevich presided over the case brought by the three Ray
brothers in Arcadia, hemophiliacs who doctors believe were exposed
to the virus through treatment with clotting agents from
contaminated blood.
   She ordered the brothers admitted to regular classes last year,
but after their house was burned, they moved with their family to
another district.

   The city's mayor urged the government to clarify whether U.S.
ships are bringing nuclear weapons into Japan.
   At 11:02 a.m., the moment when the bomb exploded in a burst of
blinding light, bells tolled as many people on the streets and in
shopping centers paused for a minute of silence.
   Nagasaki became the target of the world's second atomic attack
on Aug. 9, 1945. The United States dropped the first atomic bomb on
Hiroshima three days earlier. Japan surrendered about a week later
to end World War II.
   At Peace Park, near the point where the bomb exploded, about
20,000 people gathered for an annual service. Under a hot sun,
people poured water over a memorial tablet to recall the cries of
victims suffering from thirst and burns.
   Families presented a list of 2,295 names of bomb victims who
died during the past year, bringing to 77,462 the number of
post-war victims of nuclear radiation. Their names are inscribed on
a vault near the park's peace statue.
   In the evening, about 2,000 Roman Catholics with candles walked
through areas of the city once destroyed by the bombing, a church
official said.
   Officials estimate up to 70,000 people died immediately from the
explosion and the accompanying fire storms and radiation. About
70,000 residents still suffer from side effects of the plutonium
bomb, doctors and social workers say.
   In the bombing of Hiroshima, an estimated 70,000 to 140,000
people died. About 350,000 people in Japan hold certificates
showing they were victims of the atomic bombings in the two cities.
   Since the war Japan has followed a policy of ``three non-nuclear
principles'': no possession, manufacture or introduction into the
country of nuclear weapons.
   Speaking at the ceremony in Peace Park, Nagasaki Mayor Hitoshi
Motoshima criticized his government for allowing U.S. ships to dock
in Japan without verifying whether they carry nuclear weapons.
   ``The Japanese government should independently check whether
U.S. ships are carrying nuclear weapons when they call on Japanese
ports, and make clear that it still is observing the three
non-nuclear principles,'' Motoshima said.
   The Nagasaki bombing destroyed almost everything within a radius
of more than half a mile, including 1,326 buildings and homes. It
also demolished 23,500 homes and buildings outside that radius,
according to a report by the city.
   The ancient port city of 450,000, has been rebuilt, with modern
office towers and tree-lined avenues replacing the rubble-strewn
landscape.

<HEAD>Amish Man Who Broke Sign Law Offered Community Service Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRESTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has given an Amish man two weeks
to perform five hours of community service or face a charge of
criminal contempt for refusing to display a slow-moving-vehicle
sign on his horse-drawn buggy.
   The charge could mean a $700 fine or up to 90 days in jail.
   Fillmore County District Court Judge O. Russell Olson's ruling
Monday postponed action on a contempt charge stemming from Dan D.
Hershberger's failure to pay a $20 fine. At an Aug. 29 hearing,
Olson said he would determine whether Hershberger performed the
community service within the Amish community.
   ``There's no sense in getting into criminal contempt for
non-payment of a $20 fine,'' the judge said.
   Minnesota law requires non-motorized vehicles to display an
orange sign outlined in red at night, and to carry it at all times.
The Amish, who contend that displaying the bright signs is against
their religion, are allowed to use a black triangle outlined in
white on their buggies and wagons during the daytime.
   Last year, another judge ruled that Hershberger violated a state
law for not having the proper sign on his horse-drawn buggy.
   The judge stayed imposition of a $20 fine on condition that
Hershberger not violate that law during the next six months.
   But Hershberger was arrested a second time and ordered to pay
the fine. He refused. Prosecutors in April charged him with
criminal contempt of court, a misdemeanor.
   Olson said he modified the original sentence to permit community
service because that option had been available in other cases
involving Amish defendants.

<HEAD>Survey: Nation's Teens At Risk During Troubled Adolescent Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN PUTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The teen-age years are troubled times when
many young people drink too much, eat badly, are prone to injury
and violence and often consider suicide, according to a survey
released Tuesday.
   The data confirmed what many parents and counselors have long
known or suspected _ the adolescent years can be dangerous.
   Dr. Robert E. Windom, assistant health secretary and head of the
Public Health Service, called the results ``somewhat dismaying.''
   ``The results give us fresh insight concerning what our nation's
teen-agers know and how they act concerning health and sex-related
issues _ but they also show that too many young people, even when
they know better, don't always make the right health decisions,''
Windom said in a statement.
   The survey, sponsored by health education groups and the
Department of Health and Human Services, polled 11,000
eighth-graders and 10th-graders during the fall of 1987 from a
nationally representative sample of 217 public and private schools.
The margin of error was plus or minus 2 to 5 percentage points,
depending on the frequency of the behavior reported, officials said.
   In one of the more startling findings, the study reported that
26 percent of the eighth-graders and 38 percent of the 10th-graders
said they had had five or more drinks on one occasion during the
two weeks preceding the survey.
   Also, 42 percent of the girls and 25 percent of the boys
surveyed said they have ``seriously thought'' about committing
suicide at some time in their lives. Nearly one in five girls and
one in 10 boys of the total surveyed said they had actually tried
to commit suicide.
   W. James Popham, president of IOX Assessment Associates, which
conducted the survey, said it was possible some teen-agers
exaggerated their responses but that the results were still
``frightening'' even if the figures were off by half.
   ``I don't think they are off,'' he said. ``I really think a lot
of kids in their modest way say it's not worth it. There's a
consistent pattern of hopelessness, of depression'' in some of the
responses.
   In the area of health, the survey indicated that most teens
understand that acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS is
transmitted by sexual intercourse and drug needles.
   They also know that condoms are effective in helping avoid AIDS
and believe they should be used. But about half of the students
were unsure or mistakenly believed that washing after sex reduces
the chances of being infected.
   The teens displayed ignorance about other sexually transmitted
diseases. The survey noted that 2.5 million teen-agers are infected
with such diseases each year and that many teens cannot identify
common early signs of the infections.
   A majority of those surveyed do not know that taking birth
control pills is ineffective in avoiding these diseases. More than
a third said they would not know where to go for medical care if
they caught a sexually transmitted disease.
   The survey showed that many teens don't eat right even when they
know they should. Nearly four of every 10 students said they eat
fried foods four or more times a week. The average student ate
three snacks a day that were high in fat or sugar, and 73 percent
said they knew that eating such food may be related to heart
problems or high blood pressure.
   Sixty-one percent of the girls and 28 percent of the boys said
they had dieted during the past year, and about half of the
students who dieted used unsafe methods such as fasting. Others
tried diet pills, laxatives or vomiting.
   Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among
people aged 15 to 25, with motor vehicle accidents accounting for
more than 70 percent of accidental deaths. The survey showed that a
substantial portion of teen-agers do not guard against such
injuries.
   About 56 percent of those surveyed said they did not wear a seat
belt the last time they rode in a vehicle. About 44 percent of
10th-graders and 32 percent of eighth-graders said they had ridden
during the past month with a driver who had used drugs or alcohol.
When they ride bicycles or motorcycles, according to the survey, 92
percent said they never wear a protective helmet.
   About half the boys and one-fourth of the girls reported having
been involved in at least one fight during the year preceding the
survey. Nearly one in five girls reported that during the past year
while outside of school, someone tried to force them to have sex.
About one-fourth of the boys said they have carried a knife to
school at least once during the past year. Seven percent said they
did so on a regular basis.

   The United States is prepared to provide
logistical support to the United Nations peacekeeping force that
will monitor a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq to take effect Aug.
20, the administration said Tuesday.
   Shortly after the U.N. Security Council approved the
establishment of the 350-member force, State Department spokeswoman
Phyllis Oakley said none of the 15 council members would contribute
troops to the force, but ``we intend to be as helpful as we can.''
   The force will be funded out of U.N. peacekeeping accounts
through special assessments.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration welcomed the cease-fire announcement Monday by U.N.
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and would bear ``its fair
share of the cost'' of the observer force, including transportation
and equipment.
   ``It is our understanding that there will be neither U.S. nor
Soviet troops in the observer force,'' he added.
   ``It has been a major aim of the United States to bring this war
to an end,'' Fitzwater said. ``We now look forward to the
implementation . . . in all its parts'' of a U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for such a cease-fire.
   Mrs. Oakley expressed hope that the cease-fire would lead to
rapid progress toward a final settlement and to the restoration of
peace and security in the Persian Gulf region.
   ``We strongly support the secretary general's call for both
sides to exercise maximum military restraint until the cease-fire
is in place,'' she said.
   The Iran-Iraq situation was the subject of a meeting late Monday
involving Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead and an Arab
League delegation headed by Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal.
   It was agreed by participants at the meeting that the ``states
in the region have a vested interest in getting Iran and Iraq back
on their feet,'' said a U.S. official, insisting on anonymity.
   Earlier Tuesday, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the
United States will withdraw most of its naval forces from the
Persian Gulf only when it is convinced that the cease-fire has
taken effect.
   ``I would think we'd have to wait until the cease-fire actually
takes hold, and probably after that a prudent period to make sure
that it stays in effect,'' Carlucci said on NBC-TV's ``Today''
program.
   ``We have no desire to keep our ships, our people, there any
longer than necessary. At the same time, we don't want to put them
in any danger,'' he said in a separate interview on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   The United States has maintained a force of close to 30 warships
in the Persian Gulf to guard against attacks on oil tankers and
other neutral shipping by Iran and Iraq. Since June 1987, many
Kuwaiti tankers have carried American flags and been protected in
convoys of U.S. naval ships.
   More recently, the U.S. Navy was ordered to protect all neutral
shipping that comes under attack in the gulf.
   The United States will probably maintain a presence of three to
five ships in the region _ about what it has had there since the
1940s _ ``but that depends on the threat,'' Carlucci said on CBS.
   At the Pentagon, meantime, chief spokesman Dan Howard said the
U.S. Navy had completed its 54th convoy operation of the year early
Tuesday, with the guided-missile frigate Nicholas escorting the
reflagged Kuwaiti tanker Chesapeake City up the gulf to Kuwait.
   ``The journey was uneventful and there was no unusual air or sea
activity reported,'' Howard said.
   The spokesman said the Defense Department had not received any
reports of fighting Tuesday between Iran and Iraq either on land or
water, but added: ``I do not have a definitive report that all
hostilities have ceased. I can't speak to that one way or another.''

   Rep. Dan Mica, D-Fla., who was refused
permission by Cuban authorities last month to visit the island, has
been granted a visa and planned to fly to Havana on Tuesday, his
office said.
   Cuba abruptly revoked the visas it had given to Mica and several
aides last month in retaliation for a reception held by a U.S.
diplomat in Havana which was attended by human rights activists.
   Mica had intended to go to Cuba to investigate possible security
violations at the U.S. Interests Section in the Swiss Embassy in
Havana. He is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on
international operations.
   The State Department protested the cancellation of the visas,
calling it a ``great discourtesy'' to a member of Congress.
   An aide to Mica said the visas were reissued without explanation.
   Mica decided to visit the Interests Section, which represents
U.S. interests in Cuba in the absence of formal diplomatic
relations, after four U.S. Marine guards were withdrawn in June for
fraternizing with two Cuban women.

<HEAD>Dukakis Says He's Closer to Reagan on Some Issues Than Bush Is</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis gave credit Tuesday
to President Reagan for making progress with the Soviet Union and
asserted that he and Reagan are closer together on U.S.-Soviet
issues than the president and George Bush are.
   ``It's an administration that's growing,'' Dukakis said.
``Frankly, they're coming a lot closer to where I am.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, offered qualified
praise for Reagan's conduct of relations with the Soviets,
including nuclear arms talks. But he drew a distinction between
Reagan's foreign-policy positions and those of Vice President Bush,
who next week will become the Republican presidential nominee.
   He said Bush _ who a day earlier called Dukakis a ``stealth
candidate'' who avoids tough issues _ had been unclear himself on
many foreign policy questions.
   ``I don't think Bush's positions are clear on much of
anything,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I don't know. Do you know where he stands?'' Dukakis said to
reporters. ``I don't think anybody knows where he is on these
things.''
   Dukakis made his remarks to reporters aboard his campaign jet on
a flight from Boston to Cincinnati, where he joined his fellow
governors for the final day of the National Governors' Association
meeting.
   Dukakis spoke only briefly during discussions at the governors
conference, and later met in private with Democratic governors to
discuss the fall campaign.
   He also visited a housing redevelopment project in Cincinnati to
praise a resolution, passed unanimously by the governors, calling
for the federal government to help states and cities expand the
supply of affordable housing through housing grants and tax
measures. The resolution calls for a $2.8 billion increase in
federal spending for housing through a variety of programs that
would provide rent subsidies and address what Dukakis called ``the
problem of home ownership for young families.''
   ``Washington must be a part of the solution, and that's really
what the governors have said today,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis, on the flight to Cincinnati, was asked about a remark
he made last week in California that it appeared ``peace is
breaking out'' in various parts of the world. He was asked whether
he gave credit to Reagan.
   He called ``terrific'' recent cease-fire agreements in the
regional conflict in Angola and in the Iran-Iraq war, and gave
credit to Reagan for progress with the Soviets.
   ``The interesting thing is the president and I are closer
together on U.S.-Soviet relations than he is with Bush,'' Dukakis
said.
   ``The INF treaty (eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles from
Europe) and Reagan's approach to the summit demonstrate a
willingness on his part to explore closer relations with the Soviet
Union,'' Dukakis said. ``It's to his credit.''
   Dukakis also referred reporters to an interview published in
Tuesday's editions of the Boston Globe. In it he said, ``The
president has spent two terms in office, has grown, his views have
changed. I applaud him for it. I think one of the interesting
questions that the vice president and I will be debating will be
how it is that the president and I seem to be closer on this issue
than he and the president.''
   On the plane, Dukakis cited Reagan's description of the Soviet
Union as an ``evil empire'' during his first term and credited him
with moving away from that belief.
   ``Here's an administration that five years ago was talking evil
empire and now the president is walking arm in arm with Gorbachev
in Red Square,'' he said.
   Dukakis had critical words, however, for the administration's
policies in Central America, where Dukakis opposes support for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels opposing that country's Sandinista
government. He said that was one issue on which Bush's position was
clear and was ``on the wrong side.''
   He called Central American ``the one regional conflict where
we're missing an opportunity to work with people who want to work
with us.''

   Iran's acting commander-in-chief, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, said Tuesday his nation is seeking a comprehensive
peace but must remain vigilant in the face of Iraqi ``mischief.''
   He reflected the relieved but wary mood on the streets of the
war-weary capital.
   Rafsanjani said Iran won't initiate any military actions against
Iraq in light of the U.N. secretary-general setting Aug. 20 as the
cease-fire date in the war.
   But he said that the soldiers should maintain their vigil
against possible Iraqi attacks.
   ``The armed forces should not, from today, be the initiators of
any kind of military and armed moves,'' said Rafsanjani, who also
is speaker of Iran's parliament, in a statement read over Tehran
Radio. ``But just like always, (Iran) will be ready to give an
appropriate response to the mischiefs of the enemy.''
   Rafsanjani's message said that the Islamic Republic ``has
decided to create a lasting and comprehensive peace in the region
and will continue its path,'' but that it is faced ``with enemies
whose claims, promises and agreements cannot be trusted.''
   He said the Iraqis ``might resort to any agression and crime
during the few days left until the cease-fire date and even after
that.''
   ``Islamic Iran is proud before God for performing its holy duty
of protecting justice, and the Iraqi Baathists should answer God
and the people as to why they kindled the fire of war and what tney
gained from it,'' Rafsanjani said.
   In the streets of Tehran, Iranians greeted the announcement of
the cease-fire date in the 8-year-old Iraq-Iran war with a sense of
relief mixed with skepticism that it will mean lasting peace.
   Most learned that the shooting is to stop only at 7 a.m., when
the news came over Tehran Radio. The announcement at the United
Nations in New York came to late for the principal morning
newspaper, Jomhuri Islami.
   ``Hopefully it means peace,'' said a hotel employee in the Laleh
Hotel, the former Intercontinental. ``But celebrating? After so
many martyrs?''
   Another English-speaking man who introduced himself as a
telephone operator was smiling broadly. ``I just learned it 10
minutes ago. Sure, I will celebrate tonight with my family. I will
have a bottle of coke. You know, there is no drinking in our
country.''
   In the sprawling bazaar, the mood was still depressed among some
who lost heavily in speculating on a further rise of the free
dollar rate against the rial. The dollar had dropped to almost one
fourth of its value two months ago but seemed to have stabilized at
about one third.
   ``But most businessmen here think that things will be better in
a few months and that people's life will be much easier,'' one
merchant said.
   A Western diplomat who declined to be identified said
expectations have been running high among residents after Iraq
accepted the cease-fire without precondition.
   ``They will be disappointed, normalization will take much
time,'' he said.
   At a gas station where cars were filled up without having to
wait, a man said, ``Let us hope that this will hold, that there
will not be new fighting after two weeks.''
   The reaction was much more subdued than in Iraq, where people
poured in the streets in the middle of the night to celebrate their
``victory'' and the government declared a three-day holiday.
   A French-speaker, who said he studied political science at
Tehran University before he joined the communications services,
said ``The Americans will come back now, I am sure. I don't think
it will take more than a few months.''
   But on the 15-foot barbed-wire topped walls surrounding the vast
grounds of the former U.S. Embassy, bold English and Farsi writing
painted years ago still boasted: ``We will make America face a
severe defeat.''

<TEXT>
   Egypt and Israel ended talks Tuesday without
reaching a compromise solution to a border dispute over Taba, a
resort area on the Aqaba Gulf claimed by both countries, officials
said.
   ``There has been no agreement on any of the subjects discussed''
during the daylong talks, said Nabil Araby, head of Egypt's
delegation to an international arbitration body in Geneva that is
to settle the dispute over the 250-acre area.
   No further talks are planned, and the Israeli delegation was
scheduled to fly home later in the day, Foreign Ministry officials
said.
   Taba, which Israel captured in its 1967 war with Egypt, was not
returned after the 1979 peace treaty. The two countries in 1986
agreed to accept a final decision on the territory by a five-member
international panel in Geneva. The result of the arbitration is
expected in September.
   The United States mediated Tuesday's talks, held at a hotel near
the Giza pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo.
   The delegations in Tuesday's negotiations were led by Yossi Ben
Aharon, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's chief aide; Ahmed
Maher, director of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry's legal
department; and Abraham Sofaer, legal adviser to the U.S. State
Department.
   It was the fourth meeting between Israel and Egypt on the issue.
A previous session, held in Washington in June, also failed to
resolve the differences.
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters
Tuesday that Egypt considers Taba part of its territory and hopes
to win its case in Geneva. In recent weeks, Egyptian officials,
including President Hosni Mubarak, have emphasized that their
country's sovereignty over Taba was not negotiable.
   Taba has a hotel and a tourist village, both Israeli-owned, and
Egypt has offered to buy them.
   Ben Aharon, in an Aug. 1 interview with Newsweek magazine, said
that Egypt and Israel should ``either divide the territory or make
it a neutral zone and give both sides equal rights.''
   Maher warned in an interview published Monday in the Cairo
newspaper Al-Ahram that if the Israeli side brought up such a
suggestion during Tuesday's talks ``this would signal the end of
the meeting.''

<TEXT>
   Nearly 7,000 Soviet troops have
abandoned Kandahar, which used to be Afghanistan's second-largest
city, leaving the devastated provincial capital in the hands of
Afghan forces, diplomats said Tuesday.
   Most of the 6,750 Red Army troops were evacuated from Kandahar
by air Aug. 4-7, but a huge column of armor and heavy equipment
continues to wind its way cautiously north through western
Afghanistan, according to the reports.
   Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad, quoting witnesses, said
the last soldier _ an officer _ drove his jeep up to a waiting
Ilyushin-76 transport plane, walked up the ramp then tossed his
keys back in the seat for the Afghans to drive away.
   Kandahar's population of 200,000 has dwindled to 20,000 in the
10 years of war, according to Western estimates.
   Kabul's Marxist government recently admitted that nearly 70
percent of the city's buildings has ``been damaged or razed to the
ground.''
   If Moscow sticks to the withdrawal timetable set forth in the
Geneva accord signed in April, half of its more than 100,000 troops
should be out of Afghanistan by Aug. 15.
   Western diplomats, quoting dispatches from Kabul, said Kandahar
has been left to 3,000 ``young and apprehensive'' Afghan troops to
face continuing rocket and ground attacks by determined Moslem
guerrillas.
   The Kabul government has invited 50 foreign correspondents to
the capital to witness the ceremonial withdrawal of the first
Kabul-based Soviet units. It marks the Aug. 15 halfway point of a
total pullout from Afghanistan to be completed by Feb. 15.
   Diplomats said the two departing 500-man, 100-vehicle units are
just a fraction of the 20,000 Soviet troops believed to be
defending the heavily fortified city.
   Large units of Soviet and Afghan troops moved west into the
Paghman plains last week to dislodge 4,000 Mujahedeen insurgents
who threatened to disrupt the Aug. 4-7 visit of Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the Aug. 15 pullout ceremonies,
diplomats said.
   Heavy fighting has cost about 100 lives on each side, according
to their estimates.
   Security was so tight during Shevardnadze's stay that upon his
departure, his Tu-154 plane was protected by eight Mi-24 helicopter
gunships, plus jets above the cloud cover, all dropping clusters of
flares to ward off any guerrilla anti-aircraft missiles.
   Witnesses said the plane corkscrewed eight times skyward in a
steep climb before it reached a safe altitude to set a bearing for
Moscow.
   Western diplomatic sources said they believed his visit was to
reassure Afghan communists of the Kremlin's continued support and
to report on his talks with Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada
Yaqub Khan, whose country backs the guerrillas with Washington's
help.
   Western, Pakistani and guerrilla sources predict Kabul's
communist regime will fall quickly in the absence of Soviet
military might.

<HEAD>Texas Tech Professor First Hispanic Nominated To Cabinet Post</HEAD>

   President Reagan today announced he is
nominating Texas Tech University President Lauro Cavazos to be
secretary of education, marking the first time a Hispanic has ever
been named to the Cabinet.
   `This is a proud day ... for all Americans,'' Reagan said in
announcing the selection of Cavazos to succeed Education Secretary
William Bennett, who had announced earlier this year that he would
not serve throughout the remainder of Reagan's term.
   ``It's hard right at this moment to think of a more exciting
moment,'' said Reagan, who appeared in the White House briefing
room with Bennett and Cavazos, 61.
   Asked whether he had selected Cavazos because of his heritage,
Reagan said, ``I didn't even ask him that.'' Reagan said he
selected Cavazos because he was ``the best-fitted man to succeed''
Bennett.
   Vice President George Bush, in a speech to the League of United
Latin American Citizens in Dallas last July 6, had pledged to name
a Hispanic to the Cabinet if he were elected to succeed Reagan.
   Asked today if he had allowed Bush to influence the decision,
Reagan replied, ``No, I'm just still working at the job here.''
   Bennett said he was ready to turn over to Cavazos ``the apple,
the pencil and the key'' to the Cabinet officer's door.
   Reagan called Cavazos ``a distinguished educator.''
   ``With his administrative skills and his many accomplishments in
the field of education, Dr. Cavazos is an ideal selection for this
Cabinet post,'' the president said.
   ``His commitment to the profession of teaching and to excellence
in education and his belief in getting back to basics and things
like homework, and above all his emphasis on education of special
importance to America's minorities, are messages I hope he will
sound far and wide across the nation,'' Reagan said.
   ``This job has had its thrills during the past 91 months, and
not a few of those experiences I've shared with you in this room,''
he said. ``But it's hard right now to think of a more exciting
moment than this one, and the knowledge that Dr. Cavazos will be
the first Hispanic-American member of the Cabinet,'' he said.
   ``That says a lot about him and about Americans of Hispanic
heritage. It also says something about America _ America as a place
of opportunity and hope,'' he said.
   Cavazos is a native of south Texas and the son of a foreman of
the Santa Gertrudis Division of the huge King Ranch.
   He has served as president of Texas Tech since 1980 while also
heading the Texas Tech University Health and Sciences Center. He
was the first Texas Tech graduate and first Hispanic to hold those
two posts.
   Previously, he was a member of the faculty of Tufts University
School of Medicine as professor of anatomy and earlier had taught
at the Medical College of Virginia.
   Reagan also used the occasion to pay tribute to Bennett, calling
the departing Cabinet secretary the ``best thing to happen'' to
American education.
   In early May, Bennett said he would resign in September to
return to private life.
   Bennett made headlines throughout his tenure with acerbic
criticisms of teacher unions, school bureaucracy, colleges raising
tuitions twice as fast as inflation, and the ``Jim Crow math and
back-of-the-bus science'' meted out to black children in ghetto
schools. He called Chicago's schools the nation's worst and said
that system was in an ``educational meltdown.''

<TEXT>
   Britain on Tuesday celebrated the birth of a
princess with two 41-gun salutes, a new cocktail and heavy betting
on her name.
   Prince Andrew, saying it was ``wonderful'' to be a father,
showered the women in his life with roses and carnations _
reportedly choosing red for his red-haired wife, Sarah, and pink
for his day-old daughter, the couple's first child and the fifth
grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The daughter of the Duchess of York is a beautiful baby with
elegant hands and ``a petite little face ... just fit for a
princess,'' said the duchess' sister, Jane Makim, who lives in
Australia and received a phone call from her mother, Susan
Barrantes, after the birth.
   Andrew, fielding questions from reporters outside Portland
Hospital on Tuesday, said she probably looked like ``both of us.''
Asked whether she was pretty, he replied: ``Yes, but I am biased.''
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, the obstetrician who supervised the Monday
night delivery, said: ``I'm delighted it all went so well. All I
can say is that it was a normal birth. Both of them are doing very
well.''
   Andrew said: ``It was a long time, but she came through it very,
very well.''
   Told that he looked worried while waiting for the birth, which
he attended, the prince retorted: ``That's because I was on my way
to the dentist.''
   Buckingham Palace said the 28-year-old duchess is expected to
remain in the hospital for a few days.
   Andrew insisted that no name has been chosen for the new
princess, who is fifth in line to the throne behind the queen's
eldest son, Prince Charles, his children, Prince William and Prince
Harry, and Andrew himself.
   ``We have a few ideas but we haven't chosen a name yet,'' said
Andrew, also 28.
   British gamblers had a few ideas as well.
   ``We've been extremely busy today,'' said Wally Pyrah of Coral
Bookmakers. ``There's been plenty of interest in the baby's name.
The one name that everyone seems to want to bet in the last few
hours is Charlotte, which has seen the odds tumble from 14-1 to 6-4
favorite. I hope that doesn't mean that everyone knows before us.
   ``The second favorite is Victoria at 5-2 followed by two very
popular names, Annabel and Elizabeth, at 4-1,'' he said. Andrew had
mentioned a preference for Annabel in May.
   Cards and bouquets poured into the hospital and hundreds of
people stopped at Buckingham Palace to read the official
announcement on the gate.
   Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in Hyde Park
and at Tower Green near the Tower of London to celebrate the
princess' arrival.
   In the town of Dummer, Hampshire, where the former Sarah
Ferguson grew up, villagers at The Queen Inn pub toasted mother and
baby with a special cocktail called the ``New York'' _ made from
Babycham, Grenadine and navy rum.
   A nursery has been prepared at the couple's temporary home at
Castlewood House, a 12-bedroom mansion near Egham, southwest of
London, that King Hussein of Jordan loaned them while their own
home is being built at nearby Sunninghill Park.
   The duchess' full-time nurse, Alison Wardley, 21, will be the
youngest nanny in the royal family.
   ``I am just waiting to hear now when I will start,'' she told
reporters at her home in the city of Manchester. ``I was very
excited and very thrilled when I heard the news. It has been a long
wait.''
   The Princess of York was born on the eighth day of the eighth
month of 1988 at 8:18 p.m. She weighed in at six pounds, 12 ounces.
   The day is considered the luckiest of the century by the
Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that for prosperity.
The London press decided it was an auspicious day as well for the
first princess in the royal family since the queen's only daughter,
Princess Anne, was born in 1950.
   The Times' front-page headline said: ``At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A
Safe and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun, said: ``Fergie's
first baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.''
   The Sun said she would be the first royal bride of the 21st
century and listed six contenders ``for the tiny tot's hand,''
including Harry Soames, the 3-year-old great-grandson of Sir
Winston Churchill, and James Jagger, the 3-year-old son of rock
star Mick Jagger.

   A federal judge who was chastised by a
higher court for showing bias in favor of Ku Klux Klansmen in a
race violence case has offered to ban himself from litigation
involving the federal government.
   But so far, U.S. District Judge William M. Acker Jr., 60, has
not drawn any public call for such blanket disqualification.
   Acker, appointed to the bench by President Reagan in 1982,
scheduled a hearing on the issue for Friday.
   U.S. Attorney Frank Donaldson on Tuesday filed a response on
behalf of the government in which he said the United States ``has
at this time insufficient information to determine and no reason to
believe that Judge Acker's proposed general recusal is either
necessary or appropriate.''
   Donaldson, who said the Justice Department will not be
represented at the hearing, said it is the government's view ``that
the matter of recusal is better left for consideration on a
case-by-case basis.''
   Acker's rulings against the Justice Department in the Klan
litigation prompted the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
remove him from the case in a bluntly worded order.
   ``During the course of this litigation,'' wrote 11th Circuit
Judge Frank M. Johnson of Montgomery, ``Judge Acker's position has
become hardened against the government, and he has evidenced a
commitment that clearly reflects that he is no longer able to view
these cases impartially.''
   Acker had ruled that the actions of several Klansmen, accused of
violating the civil rights of marchers in a violent confrontation
at Decatur in 1979, did not justify what Acker said were improper
tactics used by the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
which Acker branded ``a counter-vigilante group.''
   The center had sued the Klansmen, then gave their testimony to
the Justice Department, which used it to obtain indictments against
them. Acker ruled the testimony inadmissible evidence and then did
not follow 11th Circuit instructions to admit it as evidence.
   Morris Dees, director of the center, said his organization would
take no position on Acker's qualifications to preside over
government cases.
   Dees, whose center over nearly two decades has handled a number
of highly publicized civil rights and death penalty cases, said
center attorneys will not attend Friday's hearing.
   ``We've never had any experience with Judge Acker in any other
case,'' Dees said.
   Kenneth J. Gomany, one of the attorneys for the Klansmen, said
he plans to attend the hearing ``to submit any kind of briefs in
support'' of the judge.
   ``I think he is a good and fair judge and he's ruled against our
clients and against the government on occasion. More often than
not, he's ruled against our clients. All in all, he's been
impartial,'' said Gomany.
   ``This court is neither seeking praise nor condemnation,'' Acker
wrote in June when he scheduled the hearing, ``but feels it is
necessary that it create a forum for frank and serious discussion
of a very serious subject, namely: `Should a judge whose position
is hardened against the government sit on the government's cases?'
''
   Acker's clerk said she was not aware of any briefs filed in
advance of the hearing.
   The controversy began in 1979 in Decatur, when a march by the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference ended in a bloody
confrontation with Klansmen, who beat police with clubs when
officers tried to keep them away from the marchers. Shots were
exchanged and several people were injured, none fatally.
   An initial Justice Department investigation ended without
indictments. But the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil
action against 50 Klansmen, seeking financial damages and bans on
Klan actions.
   The center took testimony from Klansmen, then made it available
to federal investigators, who used it to obtain indictments against
nine Klansmen in 1984. Acker, however, blocked the testimony,
saying it was inadmissible in the government's case.
   Acker said the Klan is ``a vigilante group which undoubtedly,
from time to time, violates the constitutional rights of citizens.''
   ``However, one vigilante group does not justify the creation and
operation of (a) counter-vigilante group in violation of the
constitutional rights of the first group.''
   ``To tolerate a rape of the rights of the Klan would be a
recognition that some sort of double standard exists for the
application of constitutional protections,'' he said.
   The government appealed and the 11th Circuit ruled that the
testimony should not be suppressed.
   The 11th Circuit ordered Acker's removal from the case when the
government filed a second appeal, arguing that he had failed to
follow the circuit court's directions.

<HEAD>Most Doctors Don't Test for AIDS Before Artificial Insemination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only 44 percent of the nation's 11,000
physicians who perform artificial insemination test the donated
semen for the AIDS virus, according to an Office of Technology
Assessment study released Tuesday.
   The study said that about 65,000 babies conceived by artificial
insemination were born in the United States last year. Semen for
more than 30,000 of those babies was provided by anonymous sperm
donors, the report by the congressional agency said.
   In a survey of 367 doctors who have at least four artificial
insemination patients a year, only 44 percent, or about 161, said
they test donors for evidence of the AIDS virus, the report said.
   Some doctors, however, reject semen if the donor is considered
at risk of being infected with AIDS. Of the doctors surveyed, 16
percent said they rejected donors due to homosexual contacts; 13
percent for intravenous drug use; 12 percent for multiple
heterosexual contacts; and 6 percent just for residency in an area
where AIDS is common.
   Homosexuality, promiscuous sexual contact and IV drug use are
all considered risk factors for contracting acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The study said 28 percent of the surveyed doctors tested sperm
donors for syphilis; 27 percent for gonorrhea; 26 percent for
hepatitis; 23 percent for chlamydia; and 6 percent for herpes.
   Fifteen surveyed sperm banks, which collect and store semen for
use under the direction of doctors, said they screen donor semen
for AIDS, although one sperm bank said the test was performed
``only if the donor were considered to be from a high risk group.''
   There have been no confirmed reports of women infected with AIDS
from donated semen, but in two locations semen from men later found
to have AIDS has been used for artificial insemination, the report
said. In Canada and Austrialia, the study says, there have been
several women who were exposed to AIDS from insemination of
infected semen.
   The Food and Drug Administration and the federal Centers for
Disease Control recommended last February that all donated semen be
frozen and quarantined for at least six months. This would enable
the semen donors to be tested for AIDS, a disease that may not show
up in blood tests for months after the sperm is infective.
   The OTA study, however, showed that 22 percent of the surveyed
physicians used only fresh semen, usually from the husband or
partner of the woman. Of the frozen semen used, 75 percent had a
quarantine period, generally of three months, the report said.
   In general, the report said, commercial sperm banks were more
likely to screen donors effectively for infertility, AIDS and
genetic defects than were individual physicians.
   About 20 percent of the women requesting artificial insemination
are turned down by the physicians, the study said. Over half the
doctors said they reject unmarried women or those whom they
consider psychologically immature.
   Almost all of the doctors said they were willing to match the
woman's specifications for donor's race, eye color and body type,
and a majority also would match specifications for educational
attainment, intelligence quotient and religion.
   Artificial insemination is a procedure whereby sperm is inserted
into the vagina or uterus by syringe or other artificial means. The
technique is commonly used for women whose husbands are sterile or
whose husbands' semen requires processing to enhance the chances of
conception. Unmarried women also request artificial insemination,
the report said.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that can be transmitted through blood
products or sperm. AIDS kills by attacking the victims' immune
system, making them susceptible to disease and some types of
cancer. There have been no known cases of full recovery from AIDS
infection.

   ``The American people deserve a serious discussion of serious

   ``I hope that we can rescue it from going in the gutter,''
Wright told reporters at his regular press briefing.

   Two North Carolina food companies will
flood the Republican National Convention next week with a
Southern-fried snack that Vice President George Bush says is his
favorite _ pork rinds.
   Carolina Fine Snacks of Greensboro and Goodmark Foods of Raleigh
are producing 13,000 bags of Grand Old Porkrinds for the delegates.
   Bush's taste for fried pork skins was made public last month
when reporters asked him how the real man differed from his
less-than-hearty image.
   ``I like pork rinds, but that doesn't fit the mold,'' Bush
responded.
   Labels on the special convention pork rinds carry the warning,
``Not to be consumed by wimps.''
   ``We thought this would be fun to do, and we were hungry for the
exposure,'' said Phil Kosak, a co-owner of Carolina Fine Snacks.
``We produce high quality pork skins. Of course, some people
consider that a liability. Some say the worse the quality, the
better the pork skin.''

<HEAD>U.S. Officials, Back From Moscow, See No Sign Of Soviet Military
Reduction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials saw no signs during last
week's trip to Moscow of a reduction in Soviet military forces or
spending, despite Soviet assurances of a new defense policy, an
American official said Monday.
   The official, who accompanied U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci on the trip but who spoke on condition of anonymity, said,
``It does not seem to us evident yet that there is any change in
force structure or resources that the Soviets are committing to
their military effort.''
   The official was in Brussels to brief the North Atlantic Council
on Carlucci's four days of talks with Soviet Defense Minister
Dmitri T. Yazov and unprecedented tours of secret Soviet military
bases. The council, the highest decision-making body of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, is made up of representatives of the
16 countries in the alliance.
   The U.S. official told reporters the Americans discussed the
Soviets' so-called defensive doctrine, under which emphasis would
be placed on defending territory rather than seizing or holding it.
   ``When we look at their forces,'' he said, ``the things that
bother us for example is their heavy emphasis'' on tanks,
artillery, engineer bridging units and airborne forces.
   He said these are the type of troops that would be used to grab
territory.
   ``Now,'' he said, ``the Soviets say they are changing to a
defensive doctrine and they don't have that objective. ... We made
clear to them that we must pay attention specifically to what their
capabilities are.''
   ``We would welcome seeing changes ... away from those kinds of
forces that would help us relieve our concerns about the offensive
capabilities of the Soviet army,'' he said.
   He did say, however, that Soviet officials provided some
evidence that military exercises ``seem to be shifting ... to
reflect'' the new doctrine.
   ``We don't dismiss the utility of that or changes of that kind
on the Soviet side,'' he said.
   Soviet authorities also told their American counterparts they
were putting together a better accounting of their defense
spending, the official said.
   ``We don't have anything concrete as to whether or not they are
in fact applying less resources to the military or not right now,''
he said. ``We don't see evidence of that in terms of what you can
see in their own production output and other efforts.''
   He said Soviet officials did not dispute U.S. estimates that
Moscow spends 15 percent to 17 percent of its economic output on
the military. U.S. defense spending amounts to about 6 percent of
the gross national product, the total value of goods and services
produced by the economy.
   The official said the two delegations also discussed ways to
prevent accidental shootings or other serious incidents between the
two countries' forces during peacetime. In 1985, a U.S. military
observer was shot and killed in East Germany while making what
American authorities said was a proper tour of the area.
   The first meeting of a working group on preventing such
incidents was scheduled to meet in the fall, the official said. No
date or place has yet been set.
   This was the third meeting between Carlucci and Yazov. They met
last March in Switzerland and again at the Moscow summit in June.
   The U.S. official said the United States was not expecting
dramatic changes in its military ties with the Soviet Union.
   ``It would be, I think, unfounded to anticipate a sea change in
our relationships with them in the military area,'' he said.
   ``These discussions in and of themselves, do not change the
security situation that we have to face. ... We find no grounds in
these contacts we have had for unilaterally altering our military
structure or our defense posture or the need for readiness or
defense spending.''

<HEAD>Appeal to Arab States for Help in Sudan's Worst Floods in 42 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moslem leader appealed to wealthy Arab
states Tuesday for emergency help for millions of victims of
Sudan's worst floods in 42 years.
   Egypt's state-run television showed helicopter views of the
capital city of Khartoum, Kassala and other badly hit areas in
neighboring Sudan, with villages turned into islands and people
slogging through knee-deep water.
   The floods, brought on by torrential rains last week, left
millions of people stranded in eastern Sudan, cut off from relief
supplies by the rising waters, authorities said.
   At least 11 Sudanese have died and more than 1 million were left
homeless by floods, Finance Minister Omar Nour el-Dayem said in
reports carried by Egypt's state-owned Middle East News Agency in
Cairo.
   He said 5,000 houses were destroyed in Khartoum alone. The news
agency said at least 40,000 houses in all were destroyed.
   The government declared the cities of Khartoum, Kassala, Showak
and el-Damer disaster areas and on Monday night announced a
nationwide six-month state of emergency.
   The news agency reported an appeal by Sheik Gad el-Haq Aly Gad
el-Haq, leader of Al-Azhar religious institution, for help from the
Islamic world, ``especially from the wealthy Moslems.'' Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait are among Sudan's main economic backers, having
provided it with oil and loans.
   Al-Azhar is considered Islam's highest seat of learning.
   On its Arabic-language newscast, Egypt Television said water had
reached up to 6{ feet but was receding.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Sudanese ambassador to Nairobi, Kenya, Omer
el-Sheikh said more than 10,000 houses were demolished.
   Electricity and water remained cut off from Khartoum for the
third straight day, Cairo's leading newspaper, Al-Ahram, said
Tuesday.
   Al-Ahram and another state-run daily, Al-Gomhouria said some of
Khartoum's 4 million inhabitants faced starvation after the power
failure disrupted bakeries and food supplies began dwindling.
   International help began pouring in after Sudan appealed for
help Sunday.
   Egypt sent 10 C-130 military transport planes carrying tents,
medical supplies and food.
   A Foreign Office spokesman in London said Britain flew in
blankets, tents and medicine Sunday night and probably will send in
more aid this week.
   The French medical humanitarian group Medicins Sans Frontieres
(Doctors Without Borders) said Tuesday it would send emergency aid
teams at Sudan's request and also planned to send 35 tons of
medical supplies, drinking water, four-wheel drive vehicles and
tents.
   In Cairo, telephone and telex operators said all lines to
Khartoum had been down for two days.
   Sudan, along with most of central Africa, had been suffering
from years of drought. Drought and a 5-year-old civil war in
southern Sudan have created widespread famine since 1985, forcing
hundreds of thousands of southerners to trek north to Khartoum and
southeast into neighboring Ethiopia.
   Ambassador el-Sheikh said it will be difficult to get relief
supplies to victims because of flooded roads. He foresaw further
hardship in that the month of August ``is expected to be a rainy
season.''
   He expressed fear of a possible outbreak of epidemics.
   Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi said in announcing a state of
emergency that it would help his government cope with flood
destruction.
   A previous state of emergency began last year and ended two
weeks ago. It was meant to counter the effects of southern rebels
and gave authorities wide-ranging powers.

<HEAD>Union Says Social Security May Be Shortchanging Some Retirees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to one-third of all recent retirees may be
getting substantially shortchanged on their Social Security checks
because of discrepancies in government records, a union
representing federal workers said Tuesday.
   A recently announced plan by the Social Security Administration
and the Internal Revenue Service to correct the records ``is a
cruel hoax and a charade,'' Kenneth L. Blaylock, president of the
American Federation of Government Employees, told two House Ways
and Means subcommittees.
   The union represents 700,000 workers, including 60,000 at the
Social Security Administration.
   Government auditors agreed that the chances of clearing up
discrepancies of past years look bleak.
   However, the IRS-Social Security agreement ``should result in
more employees' Social Security-covered earnings being properly
reported to and recorded by SSA,'' said Joseph F. Delfico, senior
associate director of the General Accounting Office.
   Blaylock's account of the extent of the records problem was
considerably worse than estimates by GAO auditors.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, estimated the
problem could cost about 10 million beneficiaries an average of $17
a month. The union put the number of affected retirees as high as
40 million and estimated the loss at up to $50 a month.
   The problem grows out of the dual reporting of employee earnings
by employers, once a year to the Social Security Administration and
once a quarter to the IRS.
   For a variety of reasons, those reports do not always match.
Between 1978 and 1984, employers reported $58.8 billion less to
Social Security than they did to the IRS.
   As a result, the IRS has turned over to Social Security trust
funds more than $7.7 billion in payroll taxes that are not credited
to the account of any worker and, thus, cannot be paid in benefits.
   The IRS and Social Security headquarters announced a plan last
month for preventing such discrepancies in the future and for
attempting to clear up the 10-year backlog of errors.
   GAO surveyed what SSA had done to correct 3.5 million employer
reports that make up the 1978-83 backlog and found that as of June
10, ``most of the differences in employer reports to the two
agencies have not been resolved and likely will not be.''
   ``Most employers SSA contacted either have not responded, are no
longer in business or no longer have the necessary records,'' GAO's
Delfico told the subcommittees.
   Another 2.1 million employer reports for 1984 through 1986 are
being checked as well.
   Landis Neal, executive director of the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare, told the subcommittee that
SSA is giving up too easily on many employers that are responsible
for the backlog of earlier years.
   ``SSA now claims that is has `resolved' almost all of the 3.5
million cases of missing or discrepant employer wage reports that
accumulated between 1978 and 1983,'' Neal said. ``What SSA means,
however, is that it considers these cases closed.
   ``Unfortunately, for hundreds of thousands of these cases, the
agency made no effort to correct the records because the amount
involved was, in its view, `too small','' Neal said.
   Norman Goldstein, chief financial officer of SSA, urged workers
to use a new government form to make sure that their own Social
Security earnings records are correct. The form, SSA-7004, is
available in Social Security offices or by calling 1-800-937-2000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, spurred by fears about sludge and
medical waste washing onto East Coat beaches, voted 97-0 on Tuesday
passage of a bill which bans the dumping of sludge in the Atlantic
Ocean.
   The action sends the measure to the House, where a similar bill
is on the floor awaiting final action.
   The bill bans the dumping of municipal sludge off the coasts of
New York and New Jersey after 1991 and orders the closing of a
sludge dump site 106 miles off the New Jersey coast. That location
is the only site where sludge currently can be legally dumped.
   The site is used by six sewage authorities in New Jersey and
three in New York, including the city of New York.
   Before approving the bill, the Senate added an amendment by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., which bans the disposal of all medical
waste in oceans or streams. It also approved another amendment, by
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., providing a five-year prison
sentence for anyone caught violating that ban.
   Both amendments were approved by voice vote without any audible
dissent.
   Dodd told his colleagues that because of medical waste washing
up on his state's beaches, ``last week, virtually every Connecticut
beach was shut down because of medical waste during one of the
hottest spells in the state's history.''
   ``We're moving closer to the day when we'll stop using the ocean
as a sewer,'' said Lautenberg, one of the co-sponsors. ``Sludge
dumping is a throwaway approach to our waste problem and
contributes to the overall ocean pollution problem.''
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., agreed. ``We're treating the oceans
as a cesspool,'' he told the Senate.
   Congress first ordered an end to the ocean dumping of sewage
sludge in 1972. Five years laters, Congress directed that the
dumping be ended by 1981. But the nine municipalities in New York
and New Jersey successfully sued in federal court to ignore that
deadline.
   ``We need a firm deadline, in the law, to ban the ocean dumping
of sewage sludge,'' said Lautenberg. ``Only then will alternatives
be put in place. Only then will the dumping stop.''

   Democrat Michael Dukakis slipped to a
seven-point lead over Republican George Bush in a Gallup poll
released Tuesday, relinquishing the boost in support he gained from
the Democratic National Convention.
   Dukakis received 49 percent backing in the survey of 1,004
registered voters, compared to 42 percent for Bush. The national
poll, conducted Friday through Sunday, had a three-point margin of
error.
   A Gallup poll two weeks ago, just after the convention, gave
Dukakis a 17-point lead, and he maintained that lead in a CBS
News-New York Times poll done July 31-Aug. 3. Before the
convention, Dukakis led by six.
   Poll analysts have characterized the double-digit Dukakis lead
as a temporary bounce created by news coverage of the Democratic
convention, and said they expected Bush to recover the ground as
the race progressed.
   ``It was just a question of when it would happen,'' said Larry
Hugick, political poll chief for Gallup. ``It has happened.'' Next,
he said, if history is a guide, Bush should draw even with Dukakis
after the GOP convention.
   Analysts affiliated with both parties reacted cautiously to the
suggestion Dukakis' lead may have slipped even before the
Republicans' convention next week.
   ``I expect fluctuations back and forth. Those things don't
surprise me right now,'' said Irwin ``Tubby'' Harrison, the Dukakis
campaign pollster. ``I'm not paying a lot of attention to the ups
and downs in polls.''
   ``It's interesting because it's the first poll showing movement
in that direction,'' said Lance Torrance, a leading Republican
pollster. ``But it needs to be confirmed by at least one or two
other national polls.''
   Torrance hypothesized that the finding could simply reflect
public interest in Bush's impending selection of a running mate.
   ``We can conjecture that some of the vice presidential naming
game has advanced the normal convention bounce ahead of time,'' he
said. ``There's been no spectacular event that could have caused
this.''
   Torrance said the question is whether Bush simply rebounded
early, or the Republican convention will propel him to an even
closer race. Measuring from Dukakis' big post-convention lead, he
said, ``Bush has to get seven points back just to be 10 points
down. To go into Labor Day 10 points down still gives you a
relatively formidable task.''
   Harrison, similarly, said the polls will take on greater
significance after Labor Day, when voters begin to know the
candidates better and to focus more on the issues. In that vein, he
said, Dukakis' early lead meant little.
   ``These are not men, even yet, about whom the public knows a
great deal,'' Harrison said. ``There's a different national poll
out every day. It's subject to great discussion. But I've found in
the past it doesn't make much sense.''

   A top State Department official said Tuesday
the absence of progress toward an internal political settlement in
Angola could block final agreement on the withdrawal of all foreign
forces from that country.
   While expressing optimism based on recent recent talks among
outside parties, Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker said
the unresolved civil war in Angola ``could hamper and postone''
efforts to reach a troop withdrawal agreement.
   Crocker spoke as South Africa prepared to begin a three-week
pullout of its troops in Angola on Wednesday under terms of a
cease-fire reached with Angola and Cuba.
   The accord, in which Crocker has served as mediator, also sets a
Nov. 1 starting date for a U.N. plan to grant independence to
Namibia from South African colonial rule.
   Angola's Marxist government has been fighting anti-communist
guerrillas for the past 13 years. That issue is not formally on
agenda for the series of talks that began in May involving South
Africa, Cuba, Angola and the United States. The main purpose of the
talks has been the withdrawal of foreign forces.
   The parties next will attempt to reach agreement on a timetable
for the withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops from
Angola. South Africa has linked its withdrawal plan to Cuba's
consent to an early pullout of its troops.
   ``It would be tragic if this moment is not seized to bring peace
to Angolans themselves as well as bringing peace to southwestern
Africa in the sense of ending the cross border conflict,'' Crocker
told a news conference.
   He said it would mean continued Soviet military support for the
Angolan government and continued American backing for the UNITA
rebels.
   The absence of progress toward an internal settlement in Angola,
he added, would have a ``direct bearing'' on the willingness of
Cuba and South Africa to compromise on the troop withdrawal
question.
   Crocker said he has made it clear to the parties that the United
States does not look on its support for UNITA as ``something to be
traded as a bargaining chip'' in the negotiations on Cuban
withdrawal.
   The United States has been providing the UNITA rebels with about
$15 million in assistance annually. Crocker said the Soviets,
meanwhile, have been sending about $1 billion a year in military
aid to their Angolan ally.
   The administration has strongly supported the concept of
national reconciliation talks between UNITA and the Angolan
government. But Angolan authorities thus far have maintained that
the best solution is for the UNITA forces to surrender their arms
and take part in a national reconstruction effort.

<HEAD>Belfast Quiet After Violent Night On Internment Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gangs of Roman Catholics set
street bonfires and threw rocks, bottles and firebombs at security
patrols early Tuesday after two Catholics were killed, apparently
by Protestant extremists.
   The sporadic rioting in Catholic areas that began Monday night
also marked the 17th anniversary of Britain's abandoned policy of
detaining suspected guerrillas without trial.
   Police believe the two Catholics slain Monday were killed in
reprisal for attacks last week by guerrillas of the predominantly
Catholic Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland, England and
West Germany that killed six people and wounded 37.
   A spokesman at Belfast's police headquarters said no violence
was reported during the day Tuesday.
   Police said security forces came under 83 separate attacks
during the overnight fighting, but the spokesman said fewer than
500 people probably were involved in the clashes that occurred
throughout the British province.
   Officials reported eight policemen were hurt, none seriously,
and four of 12 civilians injured were hospitalized.
   The IRA and its supporters continue to commemorate the
introduction of the internment law on Aug. 9, 1971, even though it
was abandoned amid worldwide criticism in 1975.
   Officials said police and soldiers were attacked with bombs,
rocks, bottles and bricks and the patrols responded by firing
plastic bullets.
   Some shots were fired at police, the officials said, but they
did not report any gunshot casualties and said at one point
security forces fired live ammunition into the air to disperse
rioters.
   Eleven people, including two teen-age girls, were freed on bail
by courts after being charged with riotous behavior.
   An 18-year-old man from Catholic west Belfast was charged with
throwing a gasoline bomb and assaulting police and remained in jail.
   Some bonfires flamed out of control and damaged buildings,
including a Baptist church, before the night's violence subsided
with demonstrators making their traditional protest of banging
garbage can lids.
   The two men killed Monday were Seamus Morris, 17, shot to death
on a Belfast street, and Peter Dolan, 25, a beer-truck deliveryman
slain when he tried to block the gunmen's getaway.
   Their deaths raised the known death toll to 2,675 from the
sectarian violence that began in 1969.
   Stanley Whittington, president of the Methodist church in
Ireland, called for the determined pursuit of ``mindless
murderers'' who cross the border to take refuge in the Irish
Republic.
   He spoke at the funeral of William Hassard, 60, one of two
construction men shot to death last Thursday by IRA terrorists
because they were working at a police station at the border town of
Belleek.
   The IRA seeks to unite Northern Ireland, where Protestants
outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly Catholic Irish
Republic.

<HEAD>Democrats Say Reagan Deregulation Efforts Went Too Far</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democratic leaders accused the Reagan
administration Tuesday of allowing its efforts to deregulate the
economy to go so far that the safety of American consumers is being
threatened.
   In a report released the week before the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans, the Democrats accused the administration
of lax enforcement of laws, inadequate staffing and financing of
regulatory agencies, and a failure to oversee industry aggressively.
   The study cited problems with the airline, railroad, banking and
maritime industries as well with children's products, food and
workplace safety, the environment, drug abuse and fire safety.
   ``We are at greater risk today when we eat, travel, go the
beach, drink water, deposit money in the bank or buy toys for our
children than we were seven and a half years ago,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., who oversaw the House Task Force on Safety that
produced the study.
   Among the report's conclusions were that Reagan has not
sufficiently financed the Coast Guard, kept up with expansion of
the airline industry or actively enforced consumer protection laws.
   ``Our society has paid an enormous price for this
administration's ideological attempts to undo a century's worth of
consumer protection,'' said Rep. Tony Coelho of California, the
House Democratic whip.
   At their news conference on the report, Democrats released a
statement from Michael Dukakis, their party's presidential
candidate, who pledged that if elected he would ``restore to
America's families the safety and protection they deserve.''
   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley criticized the study.
   ``The highly partisan attack today by members of the House Task
Force on Safety was full of inaccuracies and distortions,'' he said
in a written response.
   He blamed congressional Democrats for not providing adequate
budgets for the Coast Guard or the Federal Aviation Administration.

<TEXT>
   State Department specialists will help
investigate the bombing of the motorcade carrying Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, the U.S. Embassy said Tuesday.
   A leftist guerrilla group calling itself the Simon Bolivar
Commando claimed responsibility for the Monday explosion, which
investigators said they believed was intended to frighten rather
than kill. Three cars were damaged but no one was injured.
   CIA Director William H. Webster said drug traffickers probably
were behind the attack.
   ``In terms of the way it was done, and the amount of explosives
that were used, it ... probably came from narcotics dealers who are
protesting the vigorous legislation and action the Bolivian
government is taking,'' Webster told reporters during a visit to
Toronto, Canada.
   He said the CIA had no specific warnings of an attack on Shultz,
but ``there was a lot of security down there.''
   Shultz flew to Costa Rica from La Paz on Tuesday, with a stop in
Santa Cruz, Bolivia, to meet with former President Hugo Banzer.
   Police said the bomb consisted of several sticks of dynamite
buried by the roadside and connected to a detonator by more than 40
yards of cable. The explosion hurled rocks and chunks of pavement
at cars in the motorcade, only four of which were armored.
   One of those damaged was the armored car carrying Shultz's wife,
Helena.
   Callers to local news agencies, purporting to speak for the
Simon Bolivar Commando, described the group as ``anti-imperialist
and indigenous.''
   They also claimed responsibility in its name for a bombing
earlier this year at the home of the La Paz jail warden and an
explosion during a visit by King Juan Carlos of Spain in April 1987.
   U.S. and Bolivian investigators said they had information on the
group and believe it is responsible for bank robberies and bombings.
   Other anonymous callers claimed responsibility on behalf of a
group called the Pablo Zarate Wilca, but police discounted the
claim.
   Bolivia has had few instances of political violence in recent
years. The few bombings reported generally have caused no injuries.
   Labor and left-wing political groups had condemned the Shultz
visit as interference in Bolivia's internal affairs.
   Farmers and labor have criticized U.S. aid in fighting the drug
trade and reducing the coca leaf crop because it threatens the
livelihoods of nearly 350,000 farmers who grow coca, the raw
material for cocaine.
   A Bolivian law that took effect two weeks ago would phase out
production on 90 percent of coca plantations and impose stiff
penalties on cocaine producers and traffickers.
   The U.S. government has 40 military trainers, drug enforcement
and border patrol agents working with Bolivian police in the
anti-drug campaign.

<HEAD>House Approves $3.9 Billion Drought Relief Package</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a $3.9 billion aid package
for drought-stricken farmers Tuesday and sent the measure to
President Reagan, who made known he intends to sign it.
   ``We have kept the faith,'' House Agriculture Committee Chairman
E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, said as the House approved the
bill, 383-18. ``To all who will be helped by this legislation, our
promise has been kept.''
   The House devoted only brief debate to the measure, which
emerged from a House-Senate conference committee last week and won
Senate approval on Monday. Congress raced to put the legislation on
Reagan's desk before it begins a three-week break Friday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters hours
earlier there was no doubt that Reagan will sign the measure.
   Provisions call for government payments to farmers who have lost
more than 35 percent of their crops because of drought, hail,
excessive moisture or related damage, such as that caused by
insects. The payments would be equal to 65 percent of their losses
over the 35 percent threshhold level.
   Additional payments would be available for the farmers hardest
hit by the blazing sun and lack of rainfall that have darkened
fields in the midcontinent.
   Farmers who have received government income-support payments in
advance would not have to repay them in many cases under the
legislation.
   Those receiving payments would be required to purchase federal
crop insurance for their 1989 crops.
   The measure would make feed assistance available for producers
of many varieties of livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats,
pigs, poultry, horses used for food or in food production and fish
used for food.
   Bills involving major farm subsidies have come in for
substantial criticism on fiscal grounds from urban lawmakers in
recent years. But the drought measure escaped such complaints for
the most part.
   Rep. Bob Walker, R-Pa., did complain about a $5.5 million
authorization contained in the measure for a temperature control
system on the Sacremento River near Shasta Dam in California to aid
salmon spawning.
   ``So the bill is going to take care of yuppies, too, and make
sure their salmon mousse supply is not interfered with?'' Walker
said. He grumbled that the public is ``sick and tired of Congress
using every sort of emergency to pork barrel.''
   De la Garza replied that the drought could be even worse in
California next year than it is now.
   The legislation is a bipartisan product that was produced in
record time _ about six weeks _ with lawmakers hurrying to finish
their work and win the president's approval before any second
thoughts about the expense set in or the bill accumulated so many
special-interest provisions that it would be impossible to pass.
   ``This bill is the product of a tremendous concerted effort to
produce relief for drought-stricken farmers,'' said Rep. Edward R.
Madigan, R-Ill., the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture
Committee.
   Lawmakers and the administration believe the measure can be paid
for with funds that the government will save because of the drought.
   Income-support payments, known to farmers as deficiency
payments, increase in proportion to the size of the producer's crop
yield. The drought has reduced these yields and thus slashed the
amount that the government will be required to spend.
   By some estimates, the savings could be as much as $7 billion.
   Farmers whose yields are reduced by more than 75 percent will
come in for increased government payments under the legislation.
   These payments will be equal to 90 percent of losses over that
75 percent level.

   A cease-fire is scheduled to begin Aug. 20 in the 8-year-old
Iran-Iraq war, which has killed or wounded more than 1 million
people. Here, at a glance, are developments Tuesday in the efforts
to end the war:

<HEAD>UNITED NATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The financially strapped United Nations created a $74 million
observer corps to monitor the truce between Iran and Iraq, but
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said, ``I simply do not
have the money'' to pay for it.
   Marrack Goulding, undersecretary-general in charge of
peacekeeping operations, said the General Assembly probably would
be summoned to special session this week to assess the membership
for funds.
   Twenty-five countries will provide 350 unarmed observers. The
five permanent Security Council members _ the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union _ will not provide
personnel because the United Nations wants to avoid involvement by
the major powers.

   In Baghdad, state television announced Monday's cease-fire
declaration after midnight, declaring victory in the war and three
days of celebration. Fireworks exploded over the Tigris River and
tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition were fired into the air.

<HEAD>IRAN</HEAD>

   Iranians greeted the announcement of the cease-fire date with a
sense of relief mixed with skepticism that it will mean lasting
peace.
   In Tehran, Iran's acting commander-in-chief, Hashemi Rafsanjani,
said his nation is seeking peace but must remain vigilant in the
face of Iraqi ``mischief.'' Rafsanjani said Iran won't initiate any
military actions, but soldiers should maintain their vigil against
possible attacks.

   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the

``its fair share of the cost'' of the observer force, including
transportation and equipment.
   ``It has been a major aim of the United States to bring this war
to an end,'' Fitzwater said. ``We now look forward to the
implementation ... in all its parts'' of the U.N. Security Council
resolution calling for a cease-fire.

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said the United States will
withdraw most of its naval forces from the Persian Gulf only when
it is convinced that the cease-fire has taken effect.
   ``We have no desire to keep our ships, our people, there any
longer than necessary. At the same time, we don't want to put them
in any danger,'' he said.

   Chief Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the U.S. Navy had
completed its 54th convoy operation of the year with the

   Three men with shotguns and pistols
entered a hospital room and killed a patient and his bodyguard in
what appeared to be drug-related murders, police reported Tuesday.
   Police Cmdr. Ivan Catala said the men wore hoods, entered the
Bayamon Regional Hospital in suburban San Juan through the morgue
at about 10 p.m. Monday, killed the victims and escaped.
   He identified the slain men as Herminio Torres Quiles, 33, who
had been hospitalized for a bullet wound in the stomach, and his
bodyguard Angel M. Rosario, 30.
   Catala said drug charges were pending against Torres and
detectives believed the killings were linked to trafficking.
   Torres was wounded July 20 in a gunfight between two groups of
people at a housing project in Bayamon and his companions fled,
leaving him behind in a car. Police found a pistol and a small
quantity of drugs in the car, according to Catala.
   He said Torres would not cooperate with investigators and
refused police protection, saying he had ``his own laws'' for
dealing with enemies.

   Mohammed Ali Hamadi confessed
Tuesday he helped hijack a TWA jetliner to Beirut in 1985, but said
he is ``not ready to do something like that again'' and denied he
killed the U.S. Navy diver aboard.
   In a statement read in court, Hamadi said the four hijackers
were trying to force the release of Lebanese Shiite Moslems
imprisoned in Israel. Shortly after the ordeal was over, Israel
released approximately 700 Shiites.
   ``The decision to hijack the plane came after everything else
failed,'' Hamadi said in his surprise confession. ``There was no
other way to free the prisoners other than the means chosen.''
   Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days and U.S.
Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed. His body was thrown onto a
Beirut airport runway.
   Hamadi is being tried on charges of air piracy and murder in the
June 1985 TWA hijacking. The U.S. government also has indicted
Hamadi on charges of air piracy and murder.
   Hamadi denounced Israel for ``illegal conduct'' in Lebanon,
condemned the United States and said another hijacker had killed
Stethem. One of Hamadi's lawyers said Hamadi felt sorry for
``everyone who suffered harm.''
   In reflecting on the hijacking, Hamadi told the court: ``I am
not ready to do something like that again.''
   ``As I took part in the action, that happened out of the belief
that there was no other way to get the release of those imprisoned.
Now, I'm of the opinion that that's not the case,'' Hamadi said.
   Under West German law Hamadi can be convicted of murder even if
he did not actually fire the shots that killed Stethem, but one of
his lawyers said the court would have to prove the hijackers' plans
might have included possible murder.
   ``The court can convict him as a participant in the murder but
it has to prove that he knew what he was doing,'' said Gabrielle
Steck-Bromme.
   Three other hijacking suspects remain at large.
   Hamadi, clean-shaven in an open-neck shirt, read calmly and
clearly for about 45 minutes while Richard and Patricia Stethem,
parents of the slain diver, listened attentively to an interpreter.
   The Stethems, from Waldorf, Md., made no gestures visible to
reporters through the bulletproof glass that separates them from
Hamadi, the judges and the rest of the court.
   ``If this act which I committed is against the law, then it is a
result of illegal conduct on the part of Israel,'' said Hamadi. He
said the hijackers picked a U.S. aircraft ``because the United
States is the greatest ally and supporter of Israel.''
   Hamadi said that Hassan Iz-al-Din was in charge of the hijacking
and had been demanding a negotiator before shooting Stethem.
   ``The pistol was in his (Iz-al-Din's) hand,'' Hamadi said. ``I
didn't use it. Our orders were not to harm anyone, but I couldn't
convince him not to shoot.''
   Mrs. Steck-Bromme was asked how Hamadi felt about the Stethems'
presence in court.
   ``He feels sorry for everyone who suffered harm through the
hijacking,'' Mrs. Steck-Bromme said.
   The lawyer noted that Hamadi's age at the time of the hijacking
remains at issue and could determine whether the court will treat
him as a juvenile, young adult or an adult.
   But even if the court determines he was a juvenile, it could
decide to sentence him as an adult and hand down a maximum life
sentence.
   The judge asked Hamadi to ask his parents to come from Lebanon
to testify about his age, then recessed the trial until Sept. 6.
   Michael Senz, another of Hamadi's lawyers, said he hoped the
confession would lead to more lenient treatment.
   ``The court could now decide not to summon all American
witnesses because no identification is necessary,'' Senz said.
   West German television speculated that Hamadi's confession could
lead to speedy release of a West German hostage in Lebanon. But
government and foreign ministry spokesmen said they had no
information about any release.
   One West German, Alfred Schmidt, was released in September 1987,
but the second, Rudolf Cordes, remains a hostage.
   Cordes is believed to be held by Hezbollah, a radical
Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group thought to be holding other
Western hostages in Lebanon.

   South African soldiers
prepared Tuesday to withdraw from Angola as part of a peace accord,
but their rebel allies threatened to fight until they are included
in peace talks.
   South Africa will begin a three-week pullout of its troops in
Angola on Wednesday under terms of a cease-fire reached with Angola
and Cuba. The accord also sets a Nov. 1 starting date for a U.N.
plan to bring independence to South-West Africa, also known as
Namibia.
   An estimated 3,000 South African soldiers are in Angola and Cuba
has an estimated 50,000 soldiers in the country.
   In Zimbabwe, which has close ties to Angola, the national news
agency said Cuban troops in southern Angola were being pulled back
to positions north of the 16th parallel, roughly 90 miles north of
the Namibian border, as part of the agreement.
   The accord, announced Monday, was reached in five rounds of
U.S.-mediated peace talks among South Africa, Cuba and Angola. The
region's two main guerrilla armies were excluded.
   Spokesmen for the South-West Africa People's Organization, which
has fought for Namibian independence since 1966, said it would join
in a truce in the territory starting Sept. 1. SWAPO is believed to
have a strong chance of taking power in free elections envisioned
under the U.N. independence plan.
   But the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), which has receievd South African and U.S. aid in its
13-year war against Angola's Cuban-backed government, said its
50,000 guerrillas would continue to fight until the country's
Marxist leaders agree to negotiate a power-sharing arrangement.
   ``If the MPLA (Angola's ruling party) doesn't accept this, the
armed conflict will continue,'' UNITA spokesman Alcides Sakala told
The Associated Press in Lisbon, Portugal. ``We will be back at
square one.''
   Sakala said UNITA was not concerned by South Africa's pledge to
halt aid to the rebels or by a possible cutoff of U.S. aid.
   ``Our guerrillas are spread all over the country,'' Sakala said.
``We have enough supplies and popular support to continue this war
for many, many years.''
   The accord announced in South Africa, Cuba and Angola is
contingent on a successful outcome of a sixth round of talks the
week of Aug. 22 to set a mutually agreeable timetable for
withdrawal of the Cuban troops from Angola.
   South African commentators expressed cautious optimism Tuesday
that a final settlement was in sight.
   ``As the winter dawn broke over the northern border of
South-West Africa this morning, there was a very real hope that,
for the first time in many years, peace would come to the troubled
southwestern region of Africa,'' said the state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp.
   ``It is not the end of many years of conflict, but hopefully it
is the beginning of the end,'' the television said.
   South Africa's chief representative in Namibia,
Administrator-General Louis Pienaar, told a meeting of white
farmers the accord was ``an answer to prayers.'' He suggested that
moderates and conservatives in Namibia form a coalition to oppose
SWAPO if independence elections take place.
   Pienaar called for the drafting of an independence constitution
that would protect democracy, private enterprise and ``the
first-world community'' _ a reference to the 70,000 whites in the
territory of 1.3 million people.
   The far-right Reformed National Party urged Namibian whites
Tuesday to resist the peace plan ``to prevent this beautiful and
good country from lapsing into poverty, malpractices and suffering
as has happened elsewhere in Africa where communist tyranny stepped
in.''
   SWAPO, which has pledged to allow multiparty democracy if it
took power in Namibia, said in a statement it will ``do its level
best to help in making the peace process in the southwestern
African region irreversible and successful, provided the Pretoria
regime also shows the political will to do the same.''
   The group said a military commission would be formed by South
Africa, Cuba and Angola to monitor the cease-fire.
   South Africa has invited U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to visit the region. The U.N. chief's spokesman, Francois
Giuliani, said Tuesday the invitation was ``under consideration.''
   A potential problem in the granting of independence to Namibia
is funding. The cost has been estimated at $600 million, and a
senior U.N. official said Monday that the cash-strapped body may
have trouble financing a cease-fire observer team it will send to
the Persian Gulf.
   Another unresolved issue is South Africa's demand that Angola
close down bases of the African National Congress, the main
guerrilla group fighting to end white rule in South Africa.
Pretoria says there are seven ANC bases in Angola.
   Tom Sebina, an ANC spokesman in Lusaka, Zambia, said Tuesday
that South Africa ``is merely seeking some diversion from the talks
... The ANC camps are not connected with the talks.''

   Peace talks between the leftist Sandinista government and the

last session broke up in disagreement June 9.
   The Sandinistas have arrested opposition leaders, shut down
opposition media outlets and expelled some U.S. diplomats. The
Contras have elected new hard-line political leaders and have been
accused of carrying out attacks in the countryside in violation of
an informal cease-fire.
   The U.S. Congress has yet to reach agreement on resumption of
suspended aid to the Contras.

<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee will take the first
step Sept. 7 in disciplinary proceedings against Fofo I.F. Sunia,
the Democratic delegate from American Samoa, the panel said Tuesday.
   The committee said the disciplinary hearing also will consider
the case of Sunia's administrative assistant, Matthew K. Iuli.
   Both men pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court on Aug. 3 to
charges they conspired to defraud the government. They were accused
of operating a payroll padding scheme that netted $130,920 from
paychecks issued to ghost employees.
   Iuli also pleaded guilty to a second charge of filing a false
payroll authorization form.
   The panel said it has determined that the offenses in the
criminal case also were violations of House standards of conduct.
   Disciplinary hearings are conducted so the committee can
determine what action to recommend to the full House.
   The House can impose penalties ranging from a reprimand _ an
expression of disapproval _ to expulsion.
   A resolution by the panel, officially the Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct, said the disciplinary recommendation would be
made public.
   In the criminal action, defense attorney Earl Silbert had told
U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris that Sunia would resign before
sentencing, which was scheduled for Oct. 4.
   Sunia could receive a five-year sentence and a possible fine of
$250,000.

   Michael Dukakis and George Bush exchanged new volleys in their
political dogfight Tuesday, with Bush placing the Democratic
nominee out on the ``very, very far liberal fringe.'' Dukakis
retorted with a line borrowed from Bush's boss: ``There he goes
again.''
   Just six days before the Republican National Convention opens in
New Orleans, a new Gallup Poll showed the presidential race
tightening.
   The survey gave Dukakis 49 percent to 42 percent for Bush in
telephone interviews with 1,004 registered voters Aug. 5-7. A
Gallup survey two weeks ago gave Dukakis a 17-point lead _ 54-37 _
coming out of the Democratic convention. Both surveys had a 3
percentage point margin of error.
   ``Things are moving. We're beginning to get them in focus. Watch
and you'll see these surveys turn around,'' the vice president said.
   Bush was in Pennsylvania talking about crime and drugs, while
Dukakis was in Cincinnati discussing housing and attending the
National Governors' Association meeting.
   But both candidates took the occasion to launch new barrages _
claiming the other is fuzzy on the issues.
   Bush claimed Dukakis is trying to hide his record as governor of
Massachusetts.
   ``He's trying to run away from a record in Massachusetts on the
very, very far liberal fringe of the political fringe of the
political spectrum and I have to pin him down,'' Bush said in
Pittsburgh. ``He thinks he can pre-empt the middle.''
   ``There he goes again,'' Dukakis responded at a news conference
in Ohio, echoing Ronald Reagan's famous retort to Jimmy Carter in
their 1980 presidential debate.
   Dukakis, called ``the stealth candidate'' on Monday by Bush,
struck back Tuesday with a mirror-image barrage at the GOP
nominee-to-be.
   ``I don't think Bush's positions are clear on much of
anything,'' Dukakis told reporters as he flew to Cincinnati.
   On foreign policy _ where Bush has called Dukakis inexperienced
_ the Massachusetts governor said it is the vice president who has
little to say. Dukakis said only Bush's positions are clear only in
his support for Contra aid, which Dukakis called ``this endless
fiasco in Central America.''
   ``I don't know. Do you know where he stands?'' Dukakis said to
reporters. ``I don't think anybody knows where he is on these
things.''
   Dukakis met with fellow Democratic governors at the end of their
summer meeting, taking part in a joking presentation to New Jersey
Gov. Tom Kean, picked to deliver the keynote speech of the
Republican convention.
   Dukakis and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton _ whose lengthy
Democratic keynote speech drew derisive comments _ gave Kean a
large hourglass.
   In New Orleans, where the GOP convention opens Monday,
preparations hummed along. Carpenters banged away on the
half-million-dollar podium in the Superdome and the GOP platform
committee trudged through the drafting of each policy plank for
Bush and his still-unnamed running mate.
   Nearly 30,000 words of working papers for the platform, released
Tuesday, echoed the sentiments of the 1984 platform _ from a no-tax
increase pledge to support for anti-abortion constitutional
amendment. Bush proposals on such matters as child care and
education were added to the 1984 stances.
   In Pennsylvania for his last major campaign trip before the
convention, Bush focused on building an image as a hard-liner on
law enforcement.
   ``Let's not take away the guns of innocent citizens,'' Bush told
the state chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police in Erie. ``Let's
get tougher on the criminals.''
   Liberals in Congress drew his fire on the fight against drugs.
   ``Congress is full of rhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs,
but when it comes to law enforcement a lot of the liberals there go
AWOL,'' Bush said.
   
   Republicans are trying to orchestrate their attacks on Dukakis
day by day, with the Tuesday theme being defense and foreign policy.
   ``We believe the positions taken by Gov. Dukakis threaten the
peace, threaten world stability and threaten the protection of
American interests globally,'' said former Texas Sen. John Tower at
a news conference held by the leaders of the GOP platform
subcommittees on defense and foreign policy.
   Tom Loeffler, a former Texas congressman, said the GOP platform
would show Dukakis ``basically has a tall pole and a white flag to
pursue his foreign policy efforts.''
   In a change of pace, Dukakis had some nice things to say about
the Reagan administration, saying the nation's foreign policies are
moving toward Dukakis' stands on U.S.-Soviet relations, the Persian
Gulf and conflict in Southern Africa.
   ``It's an administration that's growing. ... Frankly they're
coming a lot closer to where I am,'' Dukakis said. ``Here's an
administration that five years ago was talking `evil empire,' and
now the president is walking arm-in-arm with Gorbachev in Red
Square.''
   ``The interesting thing is the president and I are closer
together on U.S.-Soviet relations than he is with Bush,'' Dukakis
said.

   Iraq declared victory Tuesday in the war
with Iran and the sky over the Tigris River blazed with fireworks.
   When the announcement of a cease-fire was read over state
television soon after midnight Monday, exuberant Iraqis fired tens
of thousands of rounds of ammunition into the sky.
   The television urged Iraqis to ``celebrate the great victory
achieved by Iraq'' on ``the greatest day of all.'' It declared
three days of celebration to mark the end of the 8-year-old war,
which killed or wounded more than 1 million people and cost the
combatants hundreds of billions of dollars.
   It also appealed for a halt to the shooting, which caused an
undisclosed number of casualties, but to no avail.
   Gunfire continued 24 hours later. ``This is the pressure of
pent-up emotion which has built for eight years,'' Iraqi writer
Jabra Ibrahim Jabra told a visitor as shots sounded in the streets
outside his home Tuesday night.
   Streets throughout the capital were gridlocked with horn-honking
cars into the early hours Wednesday as Iraqis jumped from their
vehicles to dance in the streets, or dangled from windows or car
rooftops.
   After the announcement on television, a man at the entrance of
the Rashid hotel shouted ``The war is over! Victory for Iraq!'' and
gazed at the flashes overhead.
   A woman beside him said: ``The war is over, praise be to God!''
   Tracers, flares and machine-gun bullets streamed into the air
for hours after the announcement. The crack and stutter of firing
filled the night.
   ``Here, take this!'' joyful security men told a reporter,
thrusting a loaded Kalashnikov assault rifle at him. The guards
later fired the gun into the air, laughing with other security men
across the street who also were shooting.
   A car in the hotel parking lot had a new bullet hole in its
hood. Children scampered about collecting empty cartridge casings.
   Celebrants danced on the beds of pickups and waved palm fronds
from car windows. People beat drums and sang as others danced in
the streets.
   Later Tuesday, a day after U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar announced that a cease-fire would begin Aug. 20, the
ruling Baath Socialist Party organized processions in Baghdad.
   Marchers waved pictures of President Saddam Hussein. They raised
Iraqi flags beside banners reading ``The Hero of Peace, President
Saddam Hussein'' and ``Masses of Baghdad Congratulate the Hero of
Victory.''
   In what the official Iraqi News Agency called the ``Communique
of Communiques,'' the president proclaimed the three-day holiday
and said: ``In the name of all Arabs and mankind, we call on Iraqis
to celebrate this great victory.''
   For the first time in nearly eight years, Iraq did not issue a
daily war communique. The last one, No. 3288 on Monday, reported
only minor skirmishes.
   Hussein attended a morning celebration at Grand Festivities Park
in Baghdad. The news agency said Sheik Jaber al Ahmed al Sabah,
emir of Kuwait, telephoned congratulations and declared Thursday a
day of celebration in Kuwait.
   The official news agency said soldiers fired 10,000 artillery
rounds to celebrate. It said 101 shots were fired in joy during
each of the five Moslem prayer times Tuesday in 17 Iraqi cities and
governorates.
   Moslem are required to face Mecca, birthplace of the prophet
Mohammed, and pray each day at dawn, noon, afternoon, evening and
night.

   Soldiers fired on young Palestinians who hurled
stones and bottles Tuesday, killing a teen-ager, hospital officials
said. Israeli aircraft bombed a radio station in Lebanon that the
army said broadcast PLO propaganda.
   A second Palestinian died and two were seriously burned after
arsonists set fire to a shack at a construction site in a Jewish
suburb of Tel Aviv, police reported. Officials did not rule out the
possibility that the attack was linked to Arab-Israeli tensions.
   Up to 21 Arabs, including a 9-year-old boy, were reported
wounded by gunfire as the Palestinian rebellion in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip began its ninth month.
   An army spokesman reported 13 Palestinians wounded but Arab
hospital officials said put the number at 21. The army said a
soldier was slightly injured when Palestinians stoned an army
outpost near Jenin in the West Bank.
   At least 238 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising,
which began Dec. 8, and four Israelis also have been slain.
   A military spokesman said the air force destroyed a PLO-run
radio station and an ammunition storehouse in southern Lebanon in
what was Israel's 12th air raid this year.
   The spokesman said the radio station, founded in early June, was
used to broadcast instructions to Palestinians in the occupied
territories.
   ``The base ... was a radio station used for propaganda and
incitement broadcasts, and to pass orders for executing terror
attacks,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping
with military regulations.
   In Lebanon, a police spokesman said three guerrillas were killed
and 12 wounded in the raid. He said the base belonged to Fatah,
Yasser Arafat's main wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Tuesday's violence in the occupied lands coincided with a
sweeping strike observed by most of the 1.5 million Arabs in the
territories and called for by underground leaders to mark the ninth
month of the Palestinian ``intefadeh,'' Arabic for ``uprising.''
   In the latest fatality, 14-year-old Hussein Swei was fatally
shot in the head during a clash between troops and dozens of Arab
youths hurling stones and bottles in the West Bank town of
Qalqilya, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, a spokesman at a United
Nations clinic said.
   An army spokesman denied the boy was shot by troops. He said a
doctor at the clinic told army investigators there were no signs of
a bullet wound on Swei's body. He did not identify the doctor.
   Palestinian youths took the body from the clinic and, despite a
curfew imposed on Qalqilya, buried it in the town's cemetery, Arab
witnesses said.
   Hundreds of Palestinians attended the burial, chanting PLO
slogans as they carried the body wrapped in a Palestinian flag,
witnesses told The Associated Press. Troops surrounded the cemetery
but no clashes were reported.
   Curfews also were in effect Tuesday on the West Bank refugee
camp of Tulkarm, the town of Husan and two Gaza Strip refugee camps.
   Police, meanwhile, arrested three Palestinians from the Gaza
Strip suspected of killing 65-year-old Rachel Weiss, of the Shafir
collective farming settlement, last week.
   Regional police commander Tuvia Golan told Israel army radio the
three youths, all aged 17, acted out of anti-Israeli feelings but
also intended to rob the woman.
   On Monday night, arsonists torched a shack in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Or Yehuda housing three Palestinian construction workers,
police said. All three were seriously burned and one died early
Tuesday of his wounds.
   Police refused to rule out the possibility that the attack was
related to Israeli-Arab tension. However, Arabs in the past also
have used violence to try to prevent fellow Palestinians from
working at jobs in Israel.
   Arab merchants shuttered their shops and many of the 110,000 who
work in Israel stayed home from their jobs, Arab news reports and
witnesses said. The strike was ordered by the PLO-linked leadership
in its underground Leaflet No. 23.
   Also Tuesday, disturbances were reported as American-born Rabbi
Meir Kahane's anti-Arab Kach Party held a news conference in Tel
Aviv to name its candidates for November's elections.
   Members of the leftist Mapam Party demonstrated outside and
police were summoned to the site after a bomb threat.
   Kahane's party calls for expelling all Arabs from Israeli-held
territory.

   George P. Shultz returned to Central
America on Tuesday for talks with the presidents of Costa Rica,
Honduras and El Salvador about the region's conflicts and the
leftist Nicaraguan government.
   The secretary of state, who escaped harm in a bomb attack on his
motorcade Monday in Bolivia, played an hour of tennis with Foreign
Minister Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto and had breakfast with President
Oscar Arias before going to Honduras. It is Shultz's third visit to
the area since June.
   Asked why his trips were so frequent, Shultz said he wanted ``to
reinforce an economic opening and political freedom'' in Central
America.
   He said he briefed Arias on his trip to South American, and the
Costa Rican president reported on his efforts to enforce the
Central America peace plan of Aug. 7, 1987.
   Arias is the plan's author and won the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize
because of it, but Central America's civil wars continue.
   During his first visit in June, the secretary tried to persuade
El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala join the United
States in a declaration accusing the Sandinistas of failing to live
up to the peace plan.
   He failed to get the signatures of the four foreign ministers at
a meeting Aug. 1 in Guatemala City, to which Nicaragua was not
invited. The declaration released simply reiterated support for
democracy and progress in the region.
   Costa Rica and Guatemala objected to a strongly worded statement
accusing the Sandinistas of failing to initiate democratic reforms
in Nicaragua and of cracking down on opposition groups. Leaders of
the two countries were said to feel that might cause the
Sandinistas to adopt an even tougher stance.
   Shultz visited with Guatemalan President Vinicio Cerezo last
week after the foreign ministers' conference. On Tuesday afternoon,
he spent two hours with Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo in
Tegucigalpa and flew to San Salvador for talks with Salvadoran Vice
President Adolfo Castillo Claramount.
   Castillo is substituting for President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who
is undergoing chemotherapy for terminal liver cancer in
Washington's Walter Reed army hospital.
   Honduras and El Salvador are close U.S. allies in Washington's
effort to isolate the Sandinista government, which the Reagan
administration considers a threat to security in Central America.
   The United States has poured military and economic aid into El
Salvador for eight years to help it fight a leftist guerrilla
insurrection. Washington also aids Honduras and Nicaraguan rebels,
known as Contras, who have supply and staging bases in Honduras
near the Nicaraguan border.
   Shultz has visited Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil as part of a
10-day tour of Latin America that began Aug. 1.
   Hew is to be in Quito, Ecuador, on Wednesday for the
inauguration of President Rodrigo Borja, a socialist lawyer, who
replaces conservative Leon Febres Cordero.
   A bomb exploded Monday amid Shultz's motorcade as he and his
entourage were driving into La Paz, capital of Bolivia. The windows
of the car carrying his wife, Helena, were shattered and two other
cars were damaged but no injuries were reported.

   President Reagan on Tuesday nominated Lauro
Cavazos, a ranch foreman's son who rose to be president of Texas
Tech University, to be secretary of education and the first
Hispanic ever to serve in the Cabinet.
   Although the nomination came during a presidential campaign in
which both candidates are eagerly courting the Hispanic vote,
Reagan said he chose Cavazos ``because he seemed to be the
best-fitted man'' for the job.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Cavazos, 61, will succeed William J.
Bennett, who announced in May that he is stepping down on Sept. 20.
   Vice President George Bush, who is certain to receive the
Republican nomination for president next week, has said that if
elected he would name a Hispanic to the Cabinet.
   Asked whether he was ``stealing some of his (Bush's) thunder,''
Reagan replied: ``No. I`m just still working at the job here.''
   Alicia Sandoval, spokeswoman for the National Education
Association, called the nomination ``just a ploy to help get Bush
elected and carry Texas. A classic case of tokenism.''
   ``We are glad that the Reagan administration has finally
appointed a Hispanic to the Cabinet, especiall in the education
field,'' Ms. Sandoval said. ``However, we feel this particular
announcement is politically motivated. Cavazos is like a substitute
teacher. He won't have the clout to change anything in the little
time he has.''
   The NEA endorsed Democratic nominee Walter Mondale against
Reagan in the 1984 presidential election. The organization has said
it will announce its 1988 candidate endorsement on Sept. 8.
   In San Antonio, Texas, Jose de Lara, president of the League of
United Latin American Citizens, called the nomination ``an
outstanding move.''
   ``I'm sorry that it took so long,'' de Lara said, but ``it's a
very smart, shrewd move by the administration.''
   De Lara added that Cavazos' selection was intended to ``mask
certain deficiencies in the administration's policies toward
Hispanic Americans, but I think we have finally demonstrated to the
administration that education is of crucial importance to Hispanics
in this country.''
   Members of the education community, canvassed by The Associated
Press, said they knew nothing about Cavazos.
   A typical response came from Robert H. Atwell, president of the
American Council on Education, an association of colleges and
universities. ``I don't know Mr. Cavazos personally or
professionally, but if he is confirmed, we will be happy to work
with him on behalf of higher education,'' Atwell said.
   Cavazos, who appeared with Reagan before reporters in the White
House briefing room, said, ``This administration has clearly
demonstrated that education is one of its highest priorities, and
the initiatives that you have begun in this vital area will be of
tremendous benefit to this nation and to this nation's future.''
   Cavazos, who has been president of Texas Tech in Lubbock since
1980, had announced in May that he planned to resign in July 1989.
He said he planned to go on leave and then return to teach anatomy
in the medical school, where he is a tenured professor.
   He is a native of Texas, where his father was a foreman on the
Santa Gertrudis division of the huge King Ranch. He and his wife,
the former Peggy Murdock, have 10 children.
   Cavazos received the National Hispanic Leadership award of the
League of United Latin American Citizens in July for his efforts to
reduce the dropout rate among Hispanic youth.
   He is a former dean of the Tufts University School of Medicine.
He began his teaching career as an associate anatomy professor at
the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond.
   At Texas Tech, he headed a university and health sciences center
with more than 24,000 students and 8,500 employees.
   ``His story is an American success story,'' Bennett said of
Cavazos. ``It is a tribute to his ability, to his hard work and to
opportunity in the United States of America.''
   Reagan also saluted Bennett, calling him ``the best thing to
happen to American education since the McGuffey reader.''
   Introducing Cavazos, the president said that ``with his
administrative skills and his many accomplishments in the field of
education, Dr. Cavazos is an ideal selection for this Cabinet
post.''
   Cavazos is not a medical doctor, but received a Ph.D. in
physiology in 1954 from Iowa State University. He earned his
bachelor's and master's degrees at Texas Tech.
   ``His commitment to the profession of teaching and to excellence
in education, his belief in getting back to basics and things like
homework and above all his emphasis on education's special
importance to America's minorities are messages I hope that he will
sound far and wide across the nation,'' Reagan said.
   The president ended his introductory remarks by addressing his
nominee with a bit of Spanish, ``Mi casa es su casa,'' or ``My
house is your house.''

<HEAD>Defense Minister Outlines Problems in Soviet Military</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov says the Soviet
Union must fight complacency in the ranks and delays in new weapons
programs if it is to keep other countries from gaining military
superiority.
   In an article published Tuesday, Yazov recommended ambitious
action to cleanse the military of outdated attitudes, improve the
reliability of military hardware and make the ``human factor''
dominant in the Soviet military.
   Yazov's article in the Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star was
an unusually frank account of problems in the Soviet military.
Before Mikhail S. Gorbachev began his policy of glasnost, or
openness, the military was presented only as strong and
problem-free.
   The defense minister has spoken candidly of the military's
problems since he was appointed in May 1987. The 64-year-old army
genera was quoted as saying in a speech three months ago that
Soviet soldiers in East Germany lack discipline and battle
readiness.
   His latest comments encompassed the entire Soviet armed forces.
   ``Our military thought is still partially constrained by
inertia, routine and a lack of competition of ideas and opinions,''
he wrote.
   He said the gap must be reduced between theoretical research on
new weapons and their actual development and deployment, and
oversimplification and showiness must be removed from military
training.
   Bureaucracy and a tendency to blame problems on others plagues
the Soviet armed forces at all levels, Yazov declared. He said
young commanders, soldiers and officers take a passive attitude
toward deficiences.
   Senior officers must not alienate themselves from those they
command, he wrote, and ``all ideological and political upbringing
must be built so that the person is always in the center of
attention.''
   Yazov said the goal should not be ``accumulation of military
might of the armed forces ... but maintenance of the might at a
level that precludes military superiority over us and guarantees a
reliable defense.''
   Last week, Yazov toured Soviet military facilities with Frank
Carlucci, the visiting U.S. defense secretary.

<HEAD>Beryl Moves Inland, Rain Elsewhere in Eastern Half Of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Beryl moved inland Tuesday and weakened to a
tropical depression, spreading rain across the South, and rain also
fell from the Great Lakes to the southern Plains and over part of
the Midwest.
   Beryl was south of Baton Rouge and was expected to move to the
west and northwest into Wednesday. Its highest sustained wind speed
was down to 40 mph during the afternoon and to 35 mph by evening. A
storm is designated a tropical storm when its wind speed hits 39
mph.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the lower
Mississippi Valley and along the central Gulf Coast in association
with Beryl, but much of the heaviest rainfall was over the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Alabama's offshore Dauphin Island got 11.6 inches of rain during
the 24-hour period up to 7 a.m. Tuesday.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along a stationary
front that extended from the lower Great Lakes through the central
Plains into the southern high Plains. But much of the rainfall was
fairly light.
   Thunderstorms developed from east-central Illinois into northern
Indiana.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms developed along Florida's
eastern coast and showers and thunderstorms were scattered along
the southern Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 103 at Altus, Okla., and Dallas-Fort
Worth, Waco and Wichita Falls, Texas. The nation's low Tuesday
morning was 30 degrees at Jackson, Wyo.
   For Wednesday, showers and thunderstorms, some with locally
heavy rain, were forecast from the lower Mississippi Valley into
the central Gulf Coast. Showers and thunderstorms also were
expected to be scattered into the southern Atlantic Coast and
Florida. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast from
northern New England through the lower Ohio Valley into the middle
Mississippi and lower Missouri valleys.
   Highs in the 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast; in the
upper 90s to around 100 over south-central Kansas through the
southern Plains into the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; between 100
and 110 across the desert Southwest; and in the 80s or 90s across
much of the rest of the nation.

<TEXT>
   A young Wall Street lawyer at the center of an
insider trading ring known as the ``Yuppie Five'' was sentenced to
four months in prison Tuesday, nearly two years after he admitted
his guilt.
   Michael David pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminal
counts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other
Wall Street professionals and an investor.
   The five, who have all pleaded guilty to various charges, were
all in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the
``Yuppie Five.'' The case had nothing to do with major insider
trading cases involving Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, said
officials.
   David, 30, of New York City, the last to plead guilty, after his
pre-trial motions were denied by U.S. District Judge John Keenan in
late 1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Comnmission
investigation.
   ``You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help
to create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' Keenan
lectured David.
   Defense lawyer Darrell Fennell asked for leniency, noting that
David faces disbarment and has been driving a cab to support
himself.
   Visibly irritated, Keenan countered: ``I don't think anyone
should confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's a
privilege!''
   ``I regret my conduct,'' David told Keenan before sentence was
imposed and asked the judge for an opportunity ``to help rebuild my
life as I have tried to do.''
   ``If I just say `Go and sin no more,' I'm making a mockery of
the process,'' said Keenan, slapping his own wrist.
   He sentenced David to four months in prison and four years
probation. Keenan did not impose a fine but David faces civil
penalties of between $50,000 and $150,000 under a Securities and
Exchange Commission consent agreement.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Lowenson Jr., noted that David
had cooperated extensively with federal investigators for almost
two years and that if any future trials arise from the probe ``Mr.
David would be an important government witness.''

   The co-defendant in the
cocaine-smuggling trial of Colombian drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas
was declared indigent Tuesday, and his trial lawyer was
re-appointed to serve as his appeal counsel.
   Jack Carlton Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., was convicted May
19 on charges he conspired to import cocaine into the United
States. He was sentenced July 20 to 15 years in prison.
   U.S. Magistrate Harvey Schlesinger re-appointed Jacksonville
attorney Stephen Weinbaum to represent Reed.
   Reed was questioned by Weinbaum, Schlesinger and Assistant U.S.
Attorney Ernst Mueller about property he earlier owned in Canada,
Panama and Norman's Cay in the Bahamas.
   He said he disposed of the property in Canada before his arrest
in February 1987 and that he didn't believe he retains any title to
the properties in the Bahamas and Panama.
   ``As far as I know, the property (on Norman's Cay) was
confiscated by Bahamian officials,'' he said.
   ``I am under the understanding that the property has been
totally ransacked and eaten by termites. If it has any value, it
would be very little,'' Reed said.
   He said if he still owns the property in Panama, ``it has no
value.''
   ``I have nothing but the suit on my back,'' said Reed, adding
that he had no bank accounts, stocks, bonds or any other assets.
   Reed was tried with Lehder, 38, reputed to be one of the leaders
of the violent Colombian Medellin cartel, believed to responsible
for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into this country.
   Lehder was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus 135
years, and fined $325,000.
   Jacksonville attorney Clyde Collins was appointed by Schlesinger
to represent Lehder in his appeal until the Colombian can hire
private counsel, replacing trial attorneys Edward R. Shohat and
Jose Quinon.
   Although Reed denied having any assets, the sentencing
memorandum prepared by former U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle, now a
Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, indicates the government
believes that Reed continued to smuggle cocaine until his arrest in
1987 and was not a poor coconut farmer living off the land as he
told Schlesinger.
   According to the memo, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent
Douglas Driver learned in late 1986 that Reed was living in a
remote location on the east coast of Panama.
   ``Between that time and the time of his arrest on Feb. 6, 1987,
Reed was involved in planning large cocaine shipments to the
western United States. ... The United States has two tape
recordings of Reed talking with a confidential source in connection
with these efforts.''
   Lehder and Reed were convicted of being members of a conspiracy
which smuggled some 3.3 tons of cocaine into the United States from
Colombia via Norman's Cay, a private island in the Bahamas.
   The total amount of cocaine documented in trial testimony was
19,700 pounds. Of that total, according to a chart prepared by
Mueller, Reed transported about 1,200 to 1,400 pounds from Colombia
to Norman's Cay and personally flew some 3,850 pounds of cocaine
into the United States from the tiny Bahamian island, about 40
miles southeast of Nassau.

   A baldness remedy developed by the
Upjohn Co. is one step closer to final federal approval, company
officials announced Tuesday.
   The Kalamazoo-based pharmaceutical company said it received an
``approvable letter'' Tuesday from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for its topical minoxidil preparation for the
treatment of male pattern baldness, developed under the trade name
Rogaine.
   An approvable letter is ``historically the last step before
final approval'' for marketing, company spokesman R.D. LaRue said.
   LaRue said the letter means the scientific data submitted by the
company have been approved, leaving only label language to be
worked out. He would not speculate when final approval may be
granted.
   Minoxidil was developed as a blood pressure treatment, but
Upjohn noted about 10 years ago that some users experienced
increased hair growth.

<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman convicted of adultery and
sentenced to death by stoning has been aquitted in a retrial and
freed.
   Shahida Parveen, 25, said Tuesday: ``I have started a new life,
I prayed to God who helped me and my husband get justice.''
   A district court judge in this southern city issued the
acquittal verdict Monday.
   Ms. Shahida was convicted on Nov. 7, 1987 of adultery by an
Islamic court that sentenced her to death by stoning.
   She had been jailed on the basis of a complaint filed by her
former husband, Khushi Mohammad, after she married Mohammad Sarwar,
her cousin. The court declared she was still legally married to
Khushi Mohammed.
   Ms. Shahida, a carpenter's daughter, was only 13 when she
married Khushi Mohammad, who was 40 at the time.
   She told the Islamic court that she and Khushi Mohammad were
divorced in April 1986 because she could not have children and he
wanted to marry another woman. The court ruled that divorce
documents she presented were forged.
   Last December The Associated Press wrote a story on the case as
Ms. Shahida was imprisoned in Karachi.
   That report and others led Mohammad Khan Junejo, who was prime
minister at the time, to examine the case and he asked Interior
Secretary S.K. Mahmud to review the convicion and sentencing.
Following an investigation the retrial in district court was
ordered.
   Islamic law requires a confession or statements by four
witnesses to prove adultery. The district court ruled that Ms.
Shahida had not made a confession and there were no witnesses.
   ``My months in prison are days I cannot forget,'' she said
Tuesday. ``I was a victim of circumstances and my former husband
wanted revenge because I married Mohammad Sarwar.''
   President Mohammad Zia ul-Haz's government introduced elements
of Islamic law into Pakistan's legal code in 1979.
   Two women previously were sentenced to death by stoning, but the
sentences were reduced to jail terms and flogging.

   A federal magistrate Tuesday ordered a
Bangor man to be returned to Philadelphia to face a charge of
threatening to shoot President Reagan.
   Louis A. Kosma, 52, formerly of Philadelphia, was arrested in
June after threats were made in a post card and a letter mailed to
the White House.
   One of the threats contained an invitation to Reagan to travel
to Philadelphia where there would be ``a 21-gun salute'' awaiting
him, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Goodwin said.
   Magistrate Edward Keith ordered the U.S. Marshal Service to
arrange for Kosma to be taken to Philadelphia.
   Sending a written threat against the president through the U.S.
mail is a federal offense that carries a maximum penalty of five
years in prison, Goodwin said.

   A bright magnesium fire caused a series
of small explosions and scared residents of this community early
Tuesday, only months after an explosion destroyed a nearby plant
that made a rocket fuel component.
   No one was injured in the pre-dawn blaze at a Titanium Metals
Corp. plant, but some residents fled the area briefly after they
were awakened by as many as six small explosions.
   Police, unsure of the nature of the problem, began to evacuate
nearby residents but allowed them to return less than an hour later
after firefighters brought the blaze under control.
   Plant Manager Bob Ritchey said the fire posed no danger to
workers or residents.
   ``Everybody's spoiled by PEPCON,'' Ritchey said. ``If somebody
sneezes, everybody runs for cover.''
   Ritchey referred to a series of explosions at a Pacific
Engineering & Production Co. plant less than three miles away that
killed two people, injured 326 and caused $73 million in propery
damage May 4. That plant was one of two in the country making
ammonium perchlorate, an oxidyzer in solid rocket fuel.
   Fire department dispatcher Melanie Dobosh said Tuesday's fire
apparently started after some magnesium ingots melted and came into
contact with water in a drain. The reaction of the metal and the
water caused the small explosions, she said.
   Magnesium is used in the manufacture of titanium.
   The fire occurred outside an abandoned building at the plant,
Ritchey said. Dobosh estimated damage at $15,000.
   The fire was reported at 1:50 a.m. and was under control by 2:40
a.m., dispatcher Jim Martin said. Officials said 60 firefighters,
including a team specializing in fires involving hazardous
materials, came to the scene and smothered the fire with salt.
   ``It produced a cloud of pretty foul-smelling smoke, but it was
not toxic,'' Ms. Dobosh said. ``It was not as bad as what it
sounded like it was.''
   The plant covers several blocks and dates to World War II,
making it one of the oldest in Henderson, an industrial community
of 55,000 people 20 miles southeast of Las Vegas.

<HEAD>Canada Will Send 385 Military Personnel To Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canada will contribute 385 military personnel to
the U.N. peacekeeping force that will monitor the cease-fire
between Iran and Iraq, Foreign Minister Joe Clark and Defense
Minister Perrin Beatty said Tuesday.
   The number includes 15 officers who will form part of the
headquarters staff in the 350-member U.N. force or take border
observer positions.
   The other 370 Canadians will be responsible for communications
for the 25-nation peacekeeping force. The communications role will
be phased out later when a civilian group takes over that function.
   Some of the Canadians will arrive Wednesday in the Persian Gulf
region as part of the U.N. advance team. The communications
contingent will start arriving Friday.
   Clark and Beatty said the cease-fire was ``a vital first step in
efforts to end the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.'' It is scheduled to
begin Aug. 20.
   The ministers said Canadian involvement ``is consistent with our
traditional commitment to the United Nations peacekeeping
operations and reflects the high regard in which Canadian Forces
peacekeeping personnel are held by the international community.''
   Canada has played a role in 17 peacekeeping missions since the
end of World War II, starting in 1949 to ease tensions between
India and Pakistan.
   The ministers praised U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar ``for his unstinting efforts that have brought the prospect
of peace to the region of the gulf.''
   They also urged Iran and Iraq to approach peace talks Aug. 25 in
Geneva ``with a spirit of openness and the intention of moving
resolutely toward a complete and final accord.''

   Attorney General-designate Dick Thornburgh
returned to his old law firm Tuesday to say goodbye, again, to his
law partners and staff.
   Thornburgh, 56, governor from 1979 to 1987, visited the downtown
office of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, where staff members prepared
punch and cookies for a brief gathering.
   Thornburgh was about a half-hour late for the function because
he also attended a fund-raising luncheon for Vice President George
Bush.
   Thornburgh, a graduate of the University of Pittsburgh School of
Law, has been associated with the law firm off and on for 30 years,
rejoining it most recently when he left the governor's office in
January 1987.
   Thornburgh also recently was director of the Institute of
Politics at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
He was nominated by President Reagan to succeed Edwin Meese III as
attorney general.

   Vice President George Bush, commenting as
aides pointed to encouraging new poll figures, said Tuesday,
``Watch and you'll see these surveys turn around.''
   Bush did not cite any figures to back up his claim that he was
catching up to Michael Dukakis. However, Sheila Tate, his press
secretary, noted a Gallup poll that said Dukakis' lead has dropped
from 17 points just after the Democratic convention to seven
points, 49 percent to 42 percent.
   ``That is turning around,'' Bush said of Dukakis' advantage.
``You watch, in the next couple of days you'll see evidence of the
turnaround on that. ... Things are moving. We're beginning to get
them in focus.''
   Bush also renewed his criticism of Dukakis, accusing his
Democratic presidential rival of trying to run away from a record
``on the very, very far liberal fringe.''
   Dukakis, when told of Bush's remarks, said merely, ``There he
goes again,'' harking back to a line that then-candidate Ronald
Reagan used to great effect in a debate with President Carter in
1980.
   Just six days before the opening of the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans, where he will become the GOP
presidential nominee, Bush said he still has not decided who will
be his running mate.
   ``I'm not close in the sense of like tomorrow making a final
decision,'' the vice president said. Bush has said he wants to keep
his decision a secret until the final day of the convention.
   Attacking Dukakis, Bush said his opponent was trying to avoid
being specific on issues.
   ``He's trying to run away from a record in Massachusetts on the
very, very far liberal fringe of the political fringe of the
political spectrum and I have to pin him down,'' Bush said.
   ``He thinks he can preempt the middle,'' Bush added.
   The vice president spoke at an airport news conference in
Pittsburgh after a speech and private fund-raiser earlier in Erie.
   Bush later cut the ribbon to open a Polish-American cultural
center in Philadelphia and, before a crowd of hundreds in a
downtown street, paid tribute to Roman Catholic Cardinal John Krol
of Philadelphia as ``an inspiration to all of us in public life or
private life.''
   He also said there was a ``special link between Poland and the
United States of America.''
   In Erie, Bush addressed the Pennsylvania lodge of the Fraternal
Order of Police, drawing loud applause with lines such as, ``So
let's not take away the guns of innocent citizens; let's get
tougher on the criminals.''
   He said the nation should band together to fight illegal drugs
with the same fervor as was demonstrated in World War II.
   Bush said states that decriminalized possession of drugs
``should recriminalize it.''
   Asked later if he felt that possession of marijuana should be
made a felony, Bush said, ``I would be very tempted to make it
strong, to make it a felony.'' He said he would be interested in
what law enforcement officials felt.
   Saying his speech was non-partisan, Bush did not mention Dukakis
by name. But he criticized the American Civil Liberties, of which
he has said Dukakis is a member, saying its ``first concerns are
the protection of criminals' rights and the potential abuse of
power by police.''
   And Bush, who has criticized the prison furlough program in
Massachusetts, said he was angered by ``the arrogant face of a
criminal, back on the street once more because of a permissive plea
bargain or some furlough.''
   Bush stressed his anti-crime theme again in an appearance
Tuesday night at the ``National Night Out Against Crime,'' where he
switched on a giant lightbulb in downtown Philadelphia in a
symbolic message that people intend to fight for safe neighborhoods.
   ``For those who commit drug related murders and for those
kingpins who are poisoning our kids the penalty shoudl be death,''
the vice president told an audience of about 200, adding that the
death penalty should also apply to people who kill police officers.
   Democrats on Capitol Hill called a news briefing to ridicule
Bush's comments on crime-fighting.
   ``George Bush thinks that hanging around with all the criminals
in the administration makes him tough on crime,'' said Rep. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
   ``Since 1981, this administration has failed to support one
nickel going to state and local law enforcement,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House narcotics committee.
   Bush said he was urging speakers at next week's Republican
convention to be positive and to focus on the issues.
   ``But I can't guarantee that somebody's not going to take a
swipe at Michael Dukakis,'' Bush said. ``I have a lot of friends
out there and they didn't like the vicious, personal attacks
(against Bush at the Democratic convention) andI did not react to
them, but I can't control everybody but I'm urging them to stay
positive, as I'm doing.''
   Bush added, ``There's a lot of people out there that want to go
after 'em. There's a lot of people that feel it was a very unfair,
totally negative tune there.''
   Emphasizing policy differences, Bush said of Dukakis, ``When he
says he's against the death penalty for everything, the country has
a right to know it. I happen to think some crimes are bad enough,
you should.

   The House passed and sent to the Senate on
Tuesday a compromise spending bill providing $59 billion for the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and 16 independent
agencies.
   The House vote was 373-30. A similar overwhelming margin was
expected in the Senate.
   The House Democratic leadership said the fiscal 1989
appropriations bill for HUD and other agencies is consistent with
the budget summit agreement worked out last year by Congress and
the White House.
   Highlights of the bill include $7.2 billion for low-income
housing assistance, $1.6 billion for public housing operating
subsidies and $1.4 billion for housing vouchers for low-income
families.
   The bill also would provide $10.7 billion for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, including $900 million for a
space station, and funds for the Environmental Protection Agency,
the Veterans Administration, the National Science Foundation and
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, among other agencies.

<HEAD>Dukakis Guards Lose Guns, ID Pins To Hotel Thief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Secret Service agents in the detail guarding
Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis lost revolvers and
Secret Service identification pins when their Boston hotel rooms
were ransacked, a spokesman said.
   Richard W. Terry, special agent in charge of the Boston office,
said the Secret Service and Boston police were moving to try to
recover the equipment, which was stolen Sunday.
   ``We do have some leads, and we're hopeful something will turn
up,'' Terry said.
   He said the theft doesn't affect the agency's ability to protect
the Massachusetts governor as he campaigns for the presidency.
   Investigators are treating the burglaries as ``random
break-ins'' but haven't ruled out the possibility that someone
intended to steal Secret Service equipment, Terry said.
   According to police reports, no signs of forced entry were left
when the Colonnade Hotel rooms of agents David Iacovetti and Daniel
Porter were broken into between 8:35 p.m. and 10:15 p.m. Sunday.
   Both agents lost Smith & Wesson .357-caliber Combat Magnum
revolvers. Porter also lost radio equipment valued at $1,500 and a
holster, while Iacovetti also lost Secret Service identification
pins, agency papers, $500 in traveler's checks, a Sony Walkman with
four tapes, and speedloaders, which are devices used for quick
reloading of guns.
   Mark Gearan, a spokesman for the Dukakis campaign, said the
governor was informed of the robbery. The loss of the equipment
isn't being viewed as a security threat, he said.
   ``We have no reason to suspect that this is anything more than a
random occurrence,'' Gearan said.

   An anti-abortion protest in which activists are
staying in jail by refusing to give their names ebbed as dozens
were released on bail, but an organizer vowed there would be more
demonstrations.
   A total of 63 protesters gave their names to authorities Monday
and Tuesday and were released on bail, said J.D. Hudson, director
of the city's Correctional Center. The center has served as the
initial holding facility for the 276 protesters arrested since
demonstrations began during the Democratic National Convention July
19.
   The releases left only 22 protesters in the city jail.
   Another 63 protesters have been bound over to State Court and
are being held in Fulton County jail. They have claimed to
represent aborted fetuses and have identified themselves only as
Baby John Doe or Baby Jane Doe. The others have been released
sporadically since their arrests.
   The protesters have been held on charges of criminal trespass or
giving a false name to police.
   Lowell Patterson, spokesman for Operation Rescue, the group that
organized the anti-abortion protests, said there will be a new
round of demonstrations.
   ``I think you can expect the next one in the morning,'' he said,
but declined to give details.
   Patterson said the protesters who identified themselves and were
released had made only a short-term commitment to the group's
effort. Those remaining in county jail are prepared to remain
indefinitely, he said.
   The demonstrators were fingerprinted after their arrests as a
matter of routine but authorities said Monday they were not using
the prints to try to identify them.
   The protesters have put a strain on Fulton County's already
crowded jail, officials said.
   Maj. A.M. Alexander, assistant director of the county jail, said
the facility is at capacity.
   The protesters still in city jail were scheduled for a court
hearing Wednesday, and they could be transferred to the county jail
then.
   If more protesters are arrested, ``they most likely will have to
start sleeping on the floor, because we are at capacity,''
Alexander said. ``We'll still feed them, we'll give them medical
treatment. But they'll sleep on the floor.''
   Patterson said daily coverage of the protests on the ``700
Club,'' former presidential candidate Pat Robertson's cable
television show, has helped attract more anti-abortion activists to
Atlanta.
   ``He is our one link to Christians all across the country that
we have not had from the secular media,'' said Patterson.
   Hudson said the city has spent $61,000 to jail the
demonstrators, and sheriff's Chief Deputy Bob Poole said the county
has spent about $66,000 so far.

   Rain washed out Wrigley Field's first game under
the lights, but folks in the surrounding Wrigleyville neighborhood
said true Chicago Cubs baseball fans showed up Tuesday night.
   Monday's game between the Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies _ the
first at night in the stadium's 74-year history _ was postponed
after heavy rain fell with the Cubs leading 3-1 in the bottom of
the fourth inning.
   But the Cubs gave night baseball another chance when they faced
the New York Mets under the lights Tuesday at 7:05 p.m. And this
time, there wasn't a rain cloud in sight.
   Also missing were the T-shirts with blinking lights, the Cubs
batting helmets with flashlights taped on top, and hords of
merrymakers who came looking for history Monday night.
   ``Last night was celebrity night and historic-event seeker's
night,'' said Sherwood Williams, the Chicago Police Department's
deputy chief of special functions.
   ``Tonight is real fan night ... tonight we have real Cubs fans
who support the team all season long, through thick and thin.''
   Zeke Closen, 69, a retired engineer from Peoria, said he felt he
was seeing history made Tuesday night.
   ``The ones who came last night said `we saw the first night
game,''' he said. ``But ask them what the score was or who won. I
feel like I'm seeing the first night game.''
   Monday's game came 40 years after the Detroit Tigers lighted up
for night baseball and left Wrigley Field the only day-only holdout.
   Still, some opponents said the aborted game proved that their
fears of rowdy fans and illegal parking were on target.
   ``There was all this screaming and cursing,'' said Gus Oing, a
20-year Wrigleyville resident who lives less than a block from the
stadium.
   ``Who wants to hear that? Does all that noise and racket have
anything to do with baseball?''
   Chicago police put 172 officers on Wrigleyville duty Monday,
including mounted and canine patrols, and they planned the same
number Tuesday, said police Capt. John Manley.
   Police arrested 35 people Monday for disorderly conduct or
public drinking, three for ticket scalping, one for fighting in the
ballpark and one for theft, Manley said.
   Mike Quigley, vice president of Citizens United for Baseball in
the Sunshine, or CUBS, said after Monday's game that his group
might seek to have the precinct housing Wrigley Field declared dry
of alcohol next spring unless night games are halted or a curfew
and other restrictions are imposed.

<TEXT>
   The Navy said Tuesday it was
apparently responsible for medical debris that washed onto beaches
remote from any metropolitan area, but that military officials did
not know how it happened.
   ``The debris which is washing ashore ... in North Carolina
appears to be connected with the United States Navy,'' said Chief
Petty Officer Joseph Mowery, a spokesman for the Navy's Atlantic
Fleet in Norfolk, Va.
   He said Navy officials had ordered a thorough cleanup and a full
investigation.
   ``Navy regulations regarding the disposal of trash, especially
medical wastes, are very stringent and we do not yet know how this
refuse came to be washed up as it has,'' he said.
   State and local authorities said it was unlikely the debris
posed a public health hazard.
   ``We don't foresee any problems at this time as far as closing
the beaches,'' said John Stevens, police chief of Indian Beach,
where syringes and vials such as those used in blood tests were
found in a trash bag Monday night.
   Gov. Jim Martin said the problem may have been exaggerated
because of recent concerns at some Northeast beaches.
   ``In the past, there have always been occasions of things like
syringes or test tubes washing up onto the beach, but people would
just pick them up and throw them away,'' Martin said. ``But, with
the well-publicized problems of the New Jersey beaches, people are
more alert to potential problems with medical debris.''
   Numerous beaches have been closed for varying periods this
summer along the coasts of New Jersey, New York's Long Island and
New England because of medical waste and sewage.
   A similar problem has cropped up on Lake Erie, with several
hundred syringes, medical-type tubes and plastic containers washing
ashore over the weekend near Cleveland. Ohio environmental crews
wearing plastic gloves combed a private beach Tuesday.
   ``I personally view this as probably one of the most disgusting
and heinous dumpings I've seen of any sort in Ohio and we see
dozens every month, usually hazardous waste,'' said Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency Director Richard L. Shank as he
surveyed the beach cleanup.
   ``This is the only time we had anything of this magnitude of
hospital, possibly infectious, waste,'' said Shank.
   He and Tim Horgan, director of environmental health for Cuyahoga
County, advised swimmers to avoid White City beach, seven miles
from downtown Cleveland.
   Horgan said syringes occasionally wash ashore, possibly insulin
needles that pass through the sewage system into Lake Erie, but the
large number found along the White City beach ``is unreasonable.''
   North Carolina's governor related the problems being faced by
the coasts to the lack of hazardous waste dumps in the country.
   ``If we cannot provide adequate facilities for properly
disposing of hazardous wastes, people are going to dump them in the
ocean,'' Martin said. ``We made a real mistake last year in not
deciding on a hazardous waste site for North Carolina.''
   Dr. Ron Levine, state health director, led a team to Atlantic
Beach on Tuesday to investigate the problem and urged people to
remain calm. A 6-inch glass tube containing a brown substance was
found there Saturday and was shipped to a state public health
laboratory Tuesday.
   Atlantic Beach Police Chief William Duke also played down the
danger of the find there.
   ``It's not medical debris as we know it,'' he said. ``It's mixed
in with waste food products. We do not think it is related to the
New Jersey-New York problem. We think it is related to a passing
vessel.''

   A senior State Department official has flown
to Panama for talks with U.S. diplomats and leading Panamanians
about the political situation in that country, the department said
Tuesday.
   Deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Morton Abramowitz, who
heads the department's bureau of intelligence and research, was
sent to Panama. She gave no other details.
   Other officials, who spoke only on condition they not be
identified, said Abramowitz's visit does not represent a renewal of
the U.S. effort to pressure Panamanian military leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega to relinquish power.
   That effort collapsed last May when Noriega balked at the terms
proposed by U.S. envoys. The State Department called off
negotiations and said no further talks would be held.
   It was not clear whether Abramowitz planned to meet with
representatives of the Noriega-led government, which the United
States has refused to recognize since it took office nearly six
months ago. The U.S. government recognizes ousted President Eric
Arturo Delvalle as the legitimate authority in Panama.
   The officials attached no significance to the fact that
Abramowitz is making the trip during the same week when Noriega
will observe the fifth anniversary of his accession as commander of
the Panamanian Defense Forces on Aug. 12.
   In Panama, Noriega called Abramowitz' visit ``not only part of
the aggression against Panama but also (of that) against Latin
America.''
   He spoke with reporters after an hour-long meeting Tuesday with
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   The visit, he said, shows ``a lack of respect that only shows
how in Latin America they (American government officials) impose
force and injustice on those who are weaker.''
   A senior Panamanian military official, who asked not to be
identified, said Abramowitz met with local opposition leaders about
a plan against the government.
   He said it included street disturbances by secondary students in
Panama City and Colon, on the Atlantic Ocean end of the Panama
Canal, and attacks on Noriega and other government leaders. The
object is to force the resignation of Manuel Solis Palma, named
interim president after Delvalle's removal, the source said.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Abramowitz would be in Panama
``several days.''
   The spokesman said he would meet with ``people with many points
of view'' but did not confirm the report of talks with opposition
leaders.
   The Reagan administration had been trying in May to work out an
agreement under which Noriega would resign as defense chief on that
anniversary.
   Ambassador Juan Sosa, a leader of anti-Noriega forces in
Washington, has said he believes Noriega may use the anniversary to
make an important announcement, possibly to launch his candidacy
for presidential elections next May.
   Noriega, indicted on drug smuggling charges by two federal grand
juries in Florida six months ago, gave a warm welcome Monday to
visiting Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who said that Panama
and Nicaragua ``are under attack by imperialist policies'' of the
United States.
   The administration has attempted through economic and diplomatic
pressure to force Noriega's departure. It was reported two weeks
ago that President Reagan had a approved a covert plan that
involved encouraging opposition political activities aimed at
discrediting Noriega.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
unscathed by a bomb attack blamed on cocaine traffickers, later
praised Bolivian efforts he said have put drug lords on the run in
this cradle of coca cultivation.
   The U.S. envoy, whose visit intended in part to express U.S.
support for Bolivia's stepped up anti-drug efforts, told reporters
he was not ``intimidated by the tactic of using violence to try to
scare government officials.''
   A remote-controlled bomb damaged three cars in Shultz'
11-vehicle motorcade as he drove to La Paz from the airport Monday
morning.
   The blast ruptured a tire and blew out three windows, including
one next to Shultz's wife Helena, who was not riding with her
husband. Another bomb went off at dawn Monday at the U.S. Embassy
commissary in La Paz.
   No injuries were reported in either blast.

   Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut sat alone
as he delivered an impassioned plea to a Republican Platform panel,
urging his GOP brethren to stand firm against apartheid in South
Africa.
   ``The regime in South Africa is no better than the regime in
Nazi Germany in the '30s,'' he said. ``That regime tried to do to
the Jewish people what South Africa is doing to the blacks.''
   Weicker, playing a role he perfected in 1984, is practically the
sole dissenter in this week's platform deliberations.
   After Weicker's testimony, conservative activist Donald Devine
said, ``It looks like Mr. Weicker is doing his usual thing: going
around making a lot of noise and not getting any votes.''
   Alone among prominent Republicans, Weicker has taken it upon
himself to push for some moderate-to-liberal platform planks,
positions that are almost certain not to emerge from the draft for
next week's GOP platform.

   The owners of The Detroit News and Detroit Free
Press praised the attorney general's decision to allow a partial
merger of the newspapers, while employees toasted their reprieve
from ``death row.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Monday granted the
newspapers' application to combine their business, production and
circulation departments. He said without a partial merger, the Free
Press, the nation's 10th-largest newspaper in terms of circulation,
could not stem the losses that had brought it to the brink of
failure.
   ``Keen competition aimed at market domination and future
profitability _ competition waged energetically but both
responsibly and properly _ has moved both newspapers into
intractable loss positions from which only one, the News, now
appears to have any reasonable prospect of emerging,'' said Meese,
who is scheduled to leave office in mid-August.

child of Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, and fifth grandchild of
Queen Elizabeth II.
   Champagne corks popped, bells rang and cameras flashed outside
Portland Hospital in central London with the announcement Monday

   Andrew, the Duke of York and second son of the monarch, drove

   The bright lights of night baseball illuminated
Wrigley Field for the first time in 74 years, but the historic game
was cut short when the rain came and lightning bolts lit up the sky.
   ``I feel like we saw the beginning of history being made, but we
didn't get to see the end,'' lawyer Donald Kurasch said Monday
night, as the heavy rain halted the game in the bottom of the
fourth inning with the Chicago Cubs leading the Philadelphia
Phillies, 3-1.
   Three hours after 91-year-old Cubs fan Harry Grossman declared
``Let there be light!'' and threw the switch that turned on the
towering Wrigley Field lights, the clouds took over.
   The game at the last major-league ballpark with day-only games
was postponed two hours and 10 minutes later, delaying Wrigley's
first official night game until tonight's contest between the Cubs
and the New York Mets.
   Monday's rain was seen as symptomatic of the Cubs' seemingly
endless disappointments to its fans, like when the team blew
potential championships in 1984 and 1969.

   The Federal Reserve Board, in a move to fight
inflation, said Tuesday it was boosting its key bank lending rate
for the first time in nearly a year. Analysts said other interest
rates likely would head higher as a result.
   With only three months left before the presidential election,
the board members, all appointed by President Reagan, sent a
dramatic signal that they were willing to push up interest rates to
dampen inflationary pressures even at the risk of endangering Vice
President George Bush's presidential aspirations.
   The increase in the discount rate, from 6 percent to 6.5
percent, was adopted by a 6-0 vote and took effect immediately. It
was the first change since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest
in more than two years.

   Investors dumped stocks and bonds Tuesday but
the dollar rallied smartly against major foreign currencies after
the Federal Reserve boosted its key bank lending rate a
half-percentage point for the first time since Black Monday.
   The increase in the discount rate, to 6.5 percent from 6
percent, was made ``to reduce inflationary pressures (and) ... in
light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the
discount rate,'' according to the Fed.
   Many economists predicted other interest rates, including those
on mortgages or home-equity loans, would rise as a result. And a
few market watchers worried about the near-term effects on the
already skittish stock market.

   Reagan II, the movie, is already causing some
concern for networks that got caught in a film controversy at the
Republican National Convention four years ago.
   Despite some grumbling after this year's Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta, the three big networks will give the
Republicans equal time for the four-day GOP convention next week in
New Orleans, though with smaller staffs.
   A filmed tribute to the outgoing president is on the program
Monday, and Vice President George Bush, the expected nominee, will
be featured in another film Thursday.
   When Reagan was a candidate, in 1984, the three networks parted
company on carrying the 18-minute promotional film shown to the
convention. NBC and CNN carried it all, ABC carried excerpts and
CBS used the time during the film to show its own report on the
Reagan administration's successes and failures.

Republicans on aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels because ``we've
gone as far as we can go.''
   But Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas pledged ``one last

whether Contra aid is a ``dead duck.''
   ``It's not a dead duck, but it hasn't flown anywhere, either,''
he replied.
   The failure of Dole's effort would set the stage for debate and

   Dirty needles, blood vials and other
infectious hospital waste found this summer on East Coast beaches
are graphic symptoms of a beleaguered disposal system that leaves
regulation to a hodgepodge of weak and confusing local laws,
Congress was told Tuesday.
   ``No federal standards exist which comprehensively address the
handling, transportation, treatment and disposal of biomedical
waste,'' said Kathryn D. Wagner, an analyst for the Office of
Technology Assessment, the technical research arm of Congress.
   ``Less than a handful (of states) have truly comprehensive
regulations,'' she said in testimony before a House subcommittee.
   The OTA, in a preliminary assessment of the nation's growing
biomedical waste problem, believes hospital debris that has been
found from Maryland to Massachusetts ``are symptoms of a deeper
problem of inconsistency, confusion and a lack of coordination both
at and between every level of management,'' Wagner said.

   Film critics gave a lukewarm
reception Tuesday to ``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' a new
interpretation of the life of Jesus that has been denounced,
unseen, by some Christians and has raised counter-charges that some
of the criticism is anti-Semitic.
   The film, which opens to the public Friday, depicts Jesus as a
troubled, guilt-ridden man at first uncertain of his destiny and
later power mad. He is tempted to resist what Christians believe is
his divinity.
   The 2{-hour movie describes Jesus' career leading to the
crucifixion. Then, during his agony on the cross, he sees a little
girl. She says she's his guardian angel sent by God, who doesn't
want him to die in pain. She removes him from the cross and heals
his wounds, and he lives out his life as a man, first marrying Mary
Magdalene and then another woman after her death.

   A U.S. official said privately Washington feels it can work with

official said.
   Relations with Nicaragua were broken in October 1985 by
conservative President Leon Febres Cordero, Washington's closest
ally in South America, whom Borja replaces. Febres Cordero could
not run for re-election becaue the constitution does not permit a
president to serve consecutive terms.

   Jeronimo Maya can't accept all the offers
he receives to play his guitar in flamenco concerts because there
are times when he has to stay home to do his homework.
   At 10, the guitar prodigy is already a veteran of three years of
flamenco shows, and his audiences have included Spain's King Juan
Carlos and Queen Sofia. Last August he was invited to Jordan by
King Hussein and Queen Noor to play at a royal wedding in Aqaba.
   ``It's always nice to play for kings and queens,'' the youngster
said during in a recent interview. ``They're nice people to meet.''
   Following a recent sold-out performance in Madrid, a music
critic for Spain's leading daily, El Pais, called Jeronimo
exceptionally talented.
   Jeronimo began playing professionally three years ago when his
guitar was nearly as big as he was. He has been studying since he
was 5 with his father, the noted flamenco guitarist Felipe Maya. He
also studies classical guitar at a Madrid conservatory.
   Maya says his son's talent and success are rooted in hard work,
not in any type of gift from God.
   Flamenco, which encompasses singing, guitar-playing, dancing and
hand-clapping, traces its roots to 16th century southern Spain
where it emerged as the artistic response of Gypsies to widespread
repression, and was influenced by elements of Jewish and Moorish
music.
   Sometimes, his father lets Jeronimo stay up to play in a 3 a.m.
``juerga'' _ a sort of flamenco jam session _ at Candela, Madrid's
hangout for flamenco artists and aficionados where he wows the
late-night crowd with the depth and sensitivity of his playing.
   Professional flamenco guitarists call him a young maestro who
plays at a level far advanced for his age.
   World-famous guitarist Sabicas says he has never heard a
youngster play so well.
   Jeronimo has already appeared twice in the annual ``Flamenco
Summit'' in Madrid, on a youth program in 1985 and as a featured
soloist last year, a spot usually reserved for such talents as Paco
de Lucia.
   Felipe Maya says Jeronimo, his other son and two daughters often
get together with him at home and hold their own ``juergas.''
   ``As Gypsies, we externalize our feelings and emotions,'' the
father said. ``We could be sitting around, and then we start
singing and dancing just because we feel like it.''
   Maya says his son has been fortunate not to encounter the
discrimination many Gypsy children suffer in Spanish schools.
   ``He's very down to earth, and in the school, people look up to
him,'' he said.
   Jeronimo, who wants to travel to China and the United States _
``to see the big New York skyscrapers'' _ also likes Brazilian and
jazz guitar and says his favorite classical composers include
Mozart, Beethoven and Debussy, the latter particularly because many
of his compositions were based on flamenco patterns.

   The Federal Reserve raised the discount rate to
6.5 percent from 6 percent this week, causing economic forecasts to
flurry about like a flock of pigeons escaped from the coop.
   It was confusing.
   Some said the Fed had to act to slow the economy, which was
overheating, and some said the action would be the death of the
economy, which already might have been showing signs of slowing.
   Some said it would hurt stocks, and some said it would make them
more attractive, since it might further strengthen the dollar,
which in turn would make foreigners with lots of money want
dollar-denominated investments.
   All this debating will continue for weeks to come and,
impressive as it might sound, could in the end, if there is one,
add up to nothing at all. As one economist observes, there seems to
be a paucity of common sense of late.
   What is proven is that (1) economists disagree, (2) they often
disagree impressively but not always with erudition, and (3) very
few people really know where the economy is going, and that may
include the Federal Reserve.
   John Tuccillo, economist and author of the lament about common
sense, noted a while ago that ``while economists have occasionally
been more spectacularly wrong, never have they been so consistently
wrong in so many small ways.''
   Tuccillo, chief economist and vice president of the National
Association of Realtors, has attempted to keep himself free from
the snares of abstract formulas and computer models that cause some
economists to leave reality.
   It allows him to comment, as he did in his latest outlook, that
``what is missing from most models is common sense.''
   In forecasting, he says, it may be more useful to observe if
your driving is impeded by public works projects, a sure sign of
prosperity, ``rather than looking at the quadratic reaction
function of monocentric economic agents.''
   Economists believe in economic models, but he observes that
those models are only as good as the data put into them. In his
view, many of the models could be filled with irrelevancies _ with
material meant for earlier eras.
   ``There are some real changes going on in the American economy
that may require some revisions in the way we look at what goes
on,'' he says. The conventional wisdom is being questioned. Old
notions might not fit today.
   At the same time, he continues, economists are under growing
pressure to comment. ``More and more economists are being asked to
comment on every little statistic,'' he says.
   Combine this pressure with those shaky models, says Tuccillo,
and you force economists to wing it. ``Often it doesn't work. Their
answers are dull, incomprehensible, wrong, or all of the above,''
he states, adding:
   ``What I am really suuggesting is that most of economics, at
least from the perspective of the general public, is common sense.
   ``Too much, the profession relies on spatial location models to
determine the best markets, rather than asking regional franchise
managers where they will be placing their franchises and why.''
   From Tuccillo's perspective, an oddity and irony of the scene is
``the more esteemed the credentials of the economists, the more
learned and academic the background, the more `scientific' the
models are, the worse are the answers.'
   Again, he calls for common sense, plain thinking and clear
expression, all of which seem, from time to time, to be forgotten
by many who attempt to think profoundly.
   And that brings him to Gracie Allen, the old comedy partner of
George Burns.
   ``I think, in essence, she is a useful guide to the times,''
says Tuccillo.
   ``Although Gracie's strings of logic were as convoluted as DNA,
they were always grounded in some observation of the real rather
than some assumption.''

<HEAD>Rowdy Aviator Pancho Barnes Featured In Television Movie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the best-selling autobiography of test
pilot Chuck Yeager, pioneer flyer Pancho Barnes is recalled by her
colleagues as a foul-mouthed hell-raiser with a face like ``a
bucket of worms.''
   The memoir, ``Yeager,'' attributes the colorful description of
Pancho's appearance to Yeager's friend, Russ Schleeh.
   In a new TV movie about the aviator's freestyle life, ``Pancho
Barnes,'' actress Valerie Bertinelli portrays the portly adventure
seeker. But the movie's producers admit they didn't cast for
physical resemblance.
   ``This is based on her character, and the spirit of it is what
we hope to capture,'' said executive producer Blue Andre.
   It took four years of combing through letters, photos, aviation
books and other research materials before Andre was ready to film
the three-hour feature, being shot this summer entirely in Texas
with largely in-state crew, staff and actors.
   ``Pancho'' was born Florence Leontine Lowe. The granddaughter of
Thaddeus Lowe, a scientist who used hydrogen balloons for artillery
observation in the Civil War, she tossed aside her genteel rearing
and her marriage to the Rev. C. Rankin Barnes to pursue her true
love _ flying. She became one of America's top-rated female pilots
and the principal stunt pilot for many Hollywood movies.
   In 1930, she flew her Travelaire Mystery Ship at an average
speed of 196.19 mph to wrest the world's speed record for women
from Amelia Earhart.
   But Pancho Barnes was better known for the rowdy hospitality she
offered to the greatest pilots of her era at her California desert
hangout, Pancho's Fly Inn. It later became known as the Happy
Bottom Riding Club, and eventually was swallowed by the expansion
of Edwards Air Force Base.
   Her hangout forms many scenes in the critically acclaimed movie,
``The Right Stuff,'' an epic about test pilots and the nation's
early astronaut program. Barnes was portrayed in the 1983 movie by
Kim Stanley, who is somewhat Bertinelli's senior.
   Bertinelli acknowledges she doesn't look like the woman she'll
be portraying but found her to be an interesting person to play.
   ``They sent me the script and I said, `Yeah, she's a really cool
woman,''' she said. ``And then I read Chuck Yeager. God! The way he
talks about her. When I talked to Chuck Yeager, I said, `What is it
about Pancho that men loved so much?' He goes, `Uh, uh, pilots.
Pilots loved her.'''
   With at least 25 vintage aircraft that rent for an average
$5,000, and expert stunt pilots, the film's flying scenes could be
just as action-packed as Barnes' life.
   In one stunt, Charlie Hillard, a double for Bertinelli,
maneuvers a World War I Stampe with a wing span of 30 feet through
the 50-foot-wide opening of a steel hangar. Exiting through the
rear, he pulls up to avoid a nearby cactus.
   The hangar stunt actually was performed by Paul Mantz in 1935.
   ``The problem is Pancho is no longer here and we know she did do
some work in some Howard Hughes movies, it's just that no one
documented what she did so they just lifted one stunt out that was
pretty famous,'' said Hillard, president of the national Eagle
Aerobatic Team.
   However, the adjustments in history don't bother Hillard, who
located the planes as aviation coordinator for the film. ``I think
this is going to be a neat little film. I think it's going to be
one of the best aviation films ever done.''
   Many of the planes used for filming were stored at Hartlee
Field, a grassy airstrip in this North Texas city once used as a
World War I training field.
   The field, operated by the non-profit Fighting Air Command,
houses a museum of vintage aircraft that are maintained in flying
condition, said Allan Clark, airport manager and museum director.
   The Chrysler Showcase Presentation is a Blue Andre Production
made in association with Pancho Productions and distributed by
Orion Television. Chrysler and the filmmakers refused to reveal its
cost, but Andre called it ``a very expensive and bigger than
normal'' TV movie budget.
   ``It's a very cost-effective way of putting our message on
television. The cost of production and commercial time is less than
if we bought the commercials themselves,'' said Chrysler spokesman
Steve Harris.
   Chrysler's expense is a boon to the Texas economy, which is
rebounding from an oil and real estate bust.
   ``Roughly a third to a half of the location production budget is
actually injected into the local budget,'' said Dana Shelton,
director of the Texas Film-Music Office in the state's Department
of Commerce.
   Fifty-three local actors have roles in the movie, several
playing major characters such as Amelia Earhart and Howard Hughes.
Most of the technical staff are Texans.
   The movie, to be aired on CBS Oct. 25, follows Barnes' life from
her late teens to her early 40s.

   A year ago, there was talk that Alan Greenspan
might become the George ``Twinkle Toes'' Selkirk of the U.S.
economy.
   Like Selkirk, the journeyman baseball player who took Babe
Ruth's place in the New York Yankees' starting lineup, Greenspan
succeeded a legend.
   How could this mild-mannered economist replace the towering Paul
Volcker, who as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board grew so large
in stature that he was often described as the second most powerful
man in America?
   In his first year as Fed chairman, Greenspan has done quite
well, thank you, according to the testimomy of members of Congress,
the Reagan administration and private economists.
   He's won friends in Congress by being more open and candid than
Volcker, who liked to cloak his answers at congressional hearings
behind a haze of cigar smoke and deliberately vague qualifiers.
   He has gained solid support inside the central bank by actively
seeking out the opinions of the other governors and the
professional staff, who had at times felt left out of
decisionmaking during Volcker's eight-year tenure.
   To be sure, there have been critics. At one time or another,
Greenspan has been attacked for tightening credit too much, not
tightening enough or for changing back and forth too often.
   But all agree that Greenspan passed his toughest test with
flying colors. When the stock market suffered its worst day ever, a
508-point drop on Oct. 19, Greenspan acted decisively.
   Mindful of the mistakes the Fed had made in the 1929 market
collapse, Greenspan quickly reassured a jittery financial system
that the central bank would supply all the credit necessary to
compensate for the sudden loss of one-half trillion dollars in
stock market wealth.
   Greenspan began developing contingency plans for just such a
calamity as soon as he took office on Aug. 11, 1987, ordering
staffers to draw up a game plan for the Fed to follow in the event
of a market emergency.
   The result was a loose-leaf notebook with a pink coversheet
marked ``restricted-controlled,'' the Fed's label for top secret.
   This document, which called for establishing a crisis-command
post at the central bank, became the guidebook Greenspan and other
top policy-makers used after Black Monday.
   Greenspan ran the Fed's crisis center from his office, keeping
in touch with regional Fed bank presidents across the country to
make sure bank credit needs were being met. Federal Reserve bank
examiners were dispatched to the major banks to provide
on-the-scene reports.
   ``Greenspan managed the stock market crisis with enormous
finesse,'' said Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor. ``People now
say nothing much happened following the market collapse, but that's
because the Fed's skillful handling prevented a total financial
meltdown.''
   The move to easier credit had represented an about-face for the
Fed, which in the weeks before the market turmoil was actually
tightening up on credit. On Sept. 4, after being in office for less
than a month, Greenspan oversaw an increase in the Fed's discount
rate to 6 percent, the first time this fee the Fed charges to make
bank loans had been raised in three years.
   The sudden increase was seen as a macho signal that Greenspan
intended to be just as tough an inflation-fighter as Volcker. But
it also opened him to criticism that he had needlessly unnerved
already jittery financial markets and had actually contributed to
the market's later crash.
   Greenspan dismisses charges that the Fed's tightening played any
role in the market plunge, saying that stocks had become overpriced
and the record drop was ``an accident waiting to happen.''
   Just Tuesday, the Fed announced another increase in the discount
rate, to 6.5 percent, saying the action ``reflects the intent of
the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures'' and ``was
taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over
the discount rate.''
   This year, the Fed has been criticized for trying to fine-tune
the economy, attempting to keep it on course with repeated, small
changes in monetary policy.
   Greenspan announced that the Fed slightly eased credit
conditions in early January because of worries about possible
sluggish growth. Then barely two months later, the Fed began
pushing interest rates back up again because of signs of unexpected
economic strength.
   While the central bank has seldom been successful pursuing a
fine-turning strategy, Greenspan supporters say at this advanced
stage of the economic recovery, there is little else the Fed can do.
   ``We are in the stage of a business cycle where the Fed has to
try to slow the economy down without killing it,'' said David Wyss,
senior financial economist at Data Resources Inc., of Lexington,
Mass.
   The Greenspan Fed also has come under fire for sending confusing
signals to the markets about what economic barometers are guiding
monetary policy. Greenspan has talked about monthly unemployment
data and business delivery times. Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson
follows the credit markets closely and Fed Governor Wayne Angell
has been a vocal proponent of watching commodity prices for clues
on inflation.
   To make matters worse, in the eyes of critics, Fed officials
talked openly about their different preferences, stirring concern
that the Fed, lacking Volcker's strong presence, was adrift.
   Fed officials have defended the new candor, pointing out that
while different barometers are being watched, the votes on monetary
policy are almost always close to unanimous. Greenspan was
sufficiently concerned by the criticism, though, that he
recommended in private that all Fed officials cool their public
comments, which they have done.
   Greenspan, 62, also has moved to assert his independence from
the administration, taking extra care lest the markets perceive
that the Fed was becoming lax in its inflation-fighting zeal
because of political pressures during an election year.
   While Fed independence is always considered crucial, Greenspan
faced particular scrutiny because of his longtime Republican ties.
He had served as chairman of President Ford's Council of Economic
Advisers and headed up a blue-ribbon commission for President
Reagan which came up with a rescue for the nearly bankrupt Social
Security system in 1983.
   At one point after a series of perceived attempts by the
administration to influence Fed decisions, Greenspan complained
publicly and warned that the concerns over political pressure could
get ``so extraordinary'' that the Fed would end up taking actions
in the opposite direction just to prove its independence.
   Since that February comment, the administration at the orders of
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III has adopted a hands-off
approach.
   So far, Greenspan's balancing act of keeping the aging recovery
alive while remaining vigilant against inflation is working. The
economy is now in its 69th month of expansion, a peacetime record.
   While being careful to say that the business cycle has not been
repealed, Greenspan clearly hopes that he and his Fed colleagues
can keep the balancing act going for a while longer. But it would
be a real feat if he does not have to deal with a recession at some
point before his four-year term ends in 1991.
   At his swearing-in ceremony a year ago, he joked about all the
economic forces that would conspire to make his job easy for him.
He took time to thank in advance: ``inflation, which always stays
put; the stock market, which is always a bull; the dollar, which is
always stable; interest rates, which always stay low, and
employment, which stays high.''

   ``Joy'' (Elektra) _ Teddy Pendergrass
   
   ``Joy'' is a steamy set of soul songs that never overheats, due
to the restraint of the tempos, arrangements and Teddy Pendergrass'
delivery.
   Even when Pendergrass sings of ``explosions of ecstacy flowing
from you and me'' (on ``2 a.m.''), his cooing manner is such that
the words would probably slip right past Tipper Gore.
   The song titles _ ``Can We Be Lovers,'' ``I'm Ready,'' ``Love Is
the Power'' _ show that Pendergrass is obsessed with the same thing
as Prince, but Pendergrass is less overt.
   The accompaniment steers clear of lead guitars or horns that
would clash with Pendergrass' smooth style. Drums, bass and
low-profile keyboards dominate. The closest thing to a frill is
three female backup singers; Pendergrass plays off them when he
raps (briefly enough to avoid being corny) and when he improvises
nicely on the chorus of ``Through the Falling Rain.''
   The eight love songs on ``Joy'' are all played at mid-tempo.
Pendergrass' message is clear: this is music for romancing, not
dancing.

   ``Brian Wilson'' (Sire) _ Brian Wilson
   
   The story's so irresistible, you almost want to will it to be
true.
   Brian Wilson, Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame member and erstwhile
Beach Boy, releases his first solo LP after 20 years of being
nearly incapacitated by mental illness. Can the lost genius ever be
found?
   Not really.
   In one respect, this new album is a triumph. Few people honestly
expected Wilson to ever again release listenable music of any form,
so anything more is gravy.
   But let's be honest. Despite some pleasant moments, ``Brian
Wilson'' can't compare with any of the early '60s Beach Boys
classics, nor a lot of other good music happening today.
   It's a nondescript album that floats by without any songs
grabbing hold and shaking out any reaction. Frankly, both the
Smithereens and XTC alter-egos Dukes of Stratosphear have written
better Brian Wilson tributes in the past year than Wilson himself.
   Back when he was young, Wilson's classic ``In My Room'' spoke
universally to teen-agers who occasionally need to escape into
themselves and not feel childish about it.
   But a generation has passed, and Wilson still hasn't left his
room. In ``Love and Mercy,'' he talks of ``lyin' in my room'' and
seeing ``a lot of people out there hurtin' and it really scares
me.'' The prescription, love and mercy, isn't much different from
what the Beatles suggested 21 years ago.
   ``Baby Let Your Hair Grow Long'' suggests a troubled girl may
cure her problems with an adjustment in grooming. A naivete that
seemed charming 25 years ago is less so now.
   And, musically, what once seemed effortless is now labored. Too
many rhythms are ponderous and the Phil Spector touches in the
production mostly sound dated.
   There are some high points: ``Walkin' the Line,'' with the vocal
help of Terence Trent D'Arby, is breezy and warm, and ``Meet Me in
My Dreams Tonight'' is a pretty fantasy song. Wilson's old Beach
Boy mates don't appear, but the a capella ``One for the Boys'' is a
worthy tribute.
   And the eight-minute concept song, ``Rio Grande,'' is not the
disaster that its length and lyrics suggest.
   No, Brian Wilson doesn't embarrass himself with this effort. But
don't throw away your old Beach Boy albums.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Will the Real Paul Reubens Please Stand Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainment writers are always informed
that Pee-wee Herman will be interviewed as Pee-wee Herman, the film
and television star, not as Paul Reubens, his real-life identity.
   How do you deal with that? Would you interview Lucille Ball as
Lucy Ricardo? Sean Connery as James Bond? How to question Pee-wee
Herman? In squeaks and baby talk?
   Such questions go through a reporter's mind as he awaits the
arrival of the star on a huge, empty Paramount studio stage. He
appears at the far end, a tiny figure in the now familiar too-tight
suit, hair plastered down, lips pursed. But as he sits down to
talk, he is _ sigh _ neither Pee-wee Herman nor Paul Reubens;
rather, he's someone in the middle.
   He has come to talk about ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' the Paramount
Pictures release he hoped would repeat the success of the 1985
``Pee-Wee's Big Adventure'' (returns so far have been respectable
but not overwhelming). But he also talked about other matters,
presumably as Paul Reubens.
   Why a circus movie?
   ``I grew up in Sarasota, Fla., which is the old winter
headquarters of the Ringling show,'' he explains. ``I knew a lot of
circus people, and I knew of a lot of circus people. My school had
a circus that included children of the performers.
   ``I always wanted to be an aerialist. But they told me I was too
scrawny to be a catcher. I thought I might be a clown or acrobat,
and I learned to walk the tightrope (which he does in the film).
But I got in show business as an actor instead. I always thought if
I didn't get successful, I'll give up and join the circus.''
   Born Paul Rubenfeld in Peekskill, N.Y., in 1952, he grew up in
Sarasota where his parents ran a lamp store. Young Paul was a
jokester, always putting on shows for the neighbor kids, later
graduating to summer stock. After high school he spent a year at
Boston University, and was then turned down by the Juilliard School
and Carnegie-Mellon University. So he enrolled at the
Disney-endowed California Institute of the Arts in Valencia.
   ``When I first came out (to Hollywood), I thought people would
discover you ... then you became a movie star and they figured out
a way to keep you a movie star,'' he reflected. ``I had an
unrealistic view of what it was all going to be like. When I
realized that I wasn't going to be one of those people who were
discovered, I decided I'd better discover myself.''
   When and where was Pee-wee born?
   ``Difficult question,'' he says cautiously. ``I was part of a
comedy group here in Los Angeles, and we had our own theater.''
   Let the record show that the theater was The Groundlings, where
Reubens appeared at night while preparing pizzas and selling Fuller
brushes by day. In 1979, he began developing the character of a
would-be comedian who is hopelessly innocent and untalented.
Pee-wee came from a one-inch harmonica, Herman from an obnoxious
childhood acquaintance.
   Pee-wee Herman became a one-hour show he performed for a year at
the Roxy theater on the Sunset Strip, then taped for HBO. ``Late
Night With David Letterman'' brought him more attention, followed
by Steve Martin TV specials and appearances on ``The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson.''
   ``Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' proved that the comedian had wide
appeal. He was one of the few who weren't surprised by the film's
success.
   ``I was confident. I felt like the script was good, and the
director (Tim Burton, who made `Beatlejuice') and the team were
good. I had a lot of pride in it. I was more relieved that it was a
success, that my feelings were right.''
   ``Pee-wee's Playhouse'' began appearing on CBS Saturday mornings
in the spring of 1987 and has been widely praised for its
imagination and entertainment value. Why did he enter children's
programming?
   ``I guess my real motivation was CBS begging me to do it. I kept
saying, `No, I don't want to do it,' and they said `Please, please
do it.' So I decided to give them a break and do it (giggling).
   ``Really, it just seemed like a fun thing to do. At first we
discussed an animated cartoon, which I didn't want to do. Then I
told them about a sort of salute to children's shows that was more
oriented for adults. It started out as a midnight show that some
called a satire; I called it a salute. So I suggested making it a
live-action show like the ones I grew up on. They said OK.''
   Reubens lapses into Herman when he discusses one of his co-stars
in ``Big Top Pee-wee,'' a talking pig.
   ``We had a nation-wide talent search for the pig, and when you
do that, you hopefully come out with talent,'' he said. ``I will
have to wait for the critics to tell me whether he stole scenes
from me. I am a giving actor, and I think he was, too. So we meet
evenly somewhere.
   ``Since I wrote the film, I have the better dialogue, funnier
lines. I also get to breathe down the director's neck in the
editing room. If the pig was getting too many laughs, then _ snip,
snip, snip. Nobody is funnier in a Pee-wee Herman movie than
Pee-Wee Herman.''
   He giggles.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time is erasing hundreds of giant artworks from
Chicago buildings, used as canvas during the 1960s and '70s, when
muralists transformed gray city landscapes with color and dreams.
   To Bill Walker, a public-art pioneer whose murals celebrate
heroes of the civil rights movement, the decay goes deeper than the
layers of paint on brick and concrete.
   ``We've lost something very important. We've lost compassion,
caring and concern for all _ much of that was expressed in the
murals,'' he said.
   Walker's powerful ``Wall of Peace and Salvation, Wall of
Understanding'' is one of about 200 urban murals splashed across
Chicago. A small movement is under way to save or restore some of
the works, but there is little money to support it.
   The mural was painted by the elevated tracks in the shadow of
Cabrini-Green, a public housing project plagued by gang warfare,
crime and violence. He chose the site, he said, because the mural
concerns choices.
   Commuters speed past its chipped and peeling images of Nobelist
Martin Luther King Jr. and slain Black Muslim Malcolm X. A youthful
Jesse Jackson is there as well. These heroes are contrasted with
symbols of death and violence _ the alternatives to a life of peace.
   The fading images, 4{ stories tall, still have a haunting
presence, though much of their power is gone.
   ``I think the city is losing part of the civil rights struggle
or human rights struggle,'' said Victor Sorell, an art history
professor at Chicago State University. ``Those murals are an index
or a signpost of those times.''
   Their deterioration represents a loss of ``neighborhood, city
and community history,'' Sorell said.
   Murals are an ``outdoor museum,'' he said, especially in poor
communities with fewer ways to preserve history and hope.
   Chicago is considered the birthplace of the movement that
produced these ``blackboards for the people'' and spread to other
U.S. cities, especially on the East Coast and in the Southwest.
   Walker's first outdoor mural, ``The Wall of Respect'' _ created
in 1967 with about a dozen other black artists from the South Side
_ is widely acknowledged as the first example of contemporary
American community murals.
   It was destroyed two years later, when fire gutted the South
Side building that served as the canvas for an 8-foot Muhammad Ali
and other portraits of prominent blacks in entertainment, politics,
the arts and religion.
   Many other works are lost or face destruction by time and the
elements, said Sorell, who has published a guide to Chicago's
murals.
   ``They most definitely should be refurbished,'' he said. ``The
question is: Where will the money come from?''
   The Chicago Public Art Group uses city, state, federal and
private funds to sponsor outdoor art work, but channels no money
toward preservation, said muralist and group member John Weber, a
professor of art at suburban Elmhurst College.
   The city still funds new public art, preferring to spend
resources on more permanent works than on restoring deteriorating
murals, said Jim Futris, director of public art for the Department
of Cultural Affairs.
   Aurelio Diaz, who spearheaded the public art movement among
Chicago's Hispanics, says the city should sponsor restoration of
the murals that chronicle the issues and struggles of its people.
   ``It's not just art, it's a way of recording the history of the
people,'' said Antonio Dos Santos, an artist who works with Diaz.
   Luis Martinez, who owns an auto repair shop near a
three-block-long Diaz work, said neighborhood residents and
businesses ``feel proud about these kind of murals. ... It's good
for everybody and helps the community improve.''
   But Walker is resigned to the loss of his works. ``The Wall of
Peace'' served a purpose in its time, he said, but perhaps that
time is past. An artist by profession, he has touched up the lower
sections of his masterpiece but never succeeded in restoring its
original 1970 appearance.
   ``I'm sad I couldn't preserve it any longer, but I didn't have
the financing,'' he said.
   During the late '70s, Diaz and city-paid teen-agers painted
murals in the Pilsen neighborhood, where Spanish is heard more than
English and Mexican bakery goods are offered at stands on every
block.
   ``The Legend of Bonampak,'' depicting an ancient Mayan fable,
was executed with help from members of different neighborhood
street gangs, recalled Diaz, 31, who emigrated from Mexico in 1971.
   ``The mural gave the kids a way to channel their creative
energy,'' he said.
   It covered years of graffiti and even now, after 11 years, there
are only a few gang scrawls on the worn surface, Diaz said.
   For years, Weber recalled, ``the gangs wouldn't touch murals in
other people's neighborhoods. One would not see graffiti on a
mural.''
   Martinez, who stored supplies for Diaz and his teen-age crew
while they painted the ``Galeria Del Barrio,'' still chops down
weeds in front of the mural.
   ``Every week you can see some tourist buses stop to look at
it,'' he said.

World Airlines Inc. said its profit after taxes nearly doubled.
   Texas Air said Monday its net loss widened to $255.9 million

company blamed a significant part of the loss on government
investigations of alleged safety problems at its two main

due to a cash payment it received from a lawsuit against the estate

   The stock market posted its third straight loss Monday. The Dow

   Bond prices were mixed.
   Corn, oat and soybean futures plunged their permitted daily
limits; livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures
advanced; precious metals fell; and stock-index futures retreated.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Surge on News of Gulf Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The announcement of an imminent cease-fire in
the 8-year-old war between Iran and Iraq has boosted oil futures
prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, advanced 61 cents Monday to close at $15.87 a barrel.
   Prices of refined oil products traded on theexchange also
soared. Wholesale heating oil for September delivery jumped 1.46
cents a gallon to finish at 44.50 cents, while wholesale unleaded
gasoline for September rose 1.42 cents to 46.65 cents.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar announced that
Iran and Iraq would begin a cease-fire in their Persian Gulf war on
Aug. 20. The news followed several days of intense diplomacy that
ended a deadlock in nearly two weeks of U.N.-mediated truce talks.
   ``The notice of a cease-fire was the primary positive,'' said
Fred Demler, an economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Many oil traders believe the cease-fire will lead to more
cohesion within the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, of which Iran and Iraq are members. That could lead to a
reduction of overproduction by they and other OPEC members.
   But other traders are more skeptical. They warn that Iran and
Iraq will badly need oil revenues after the war to rebuild their
ravaged economies, and will be tempted to continue to exceed their
official OPEC production quotas.
   Demler said the advance in futures prices also was fueled by
technical market factors.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the government's latest auction to the highest
level since before the October stock market crash.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.8 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 6.94 percent on Monday, up from 6.89
percent last week. Another $6.8 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.26 percent, up from 7.15 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since Oct. 13, when three-month bills
sold for 6.96 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.34 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.16 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,824.60 and 7.64 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,633.00.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.89 percent last
week from 7.85 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Venezuela Seeking New Foreign Loans Amid Growing Debt Frustration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARRIE FIGDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government mission charged with
extracting new loans from foreign commercial banks begins its
difficult task this week amid Venezuela's growing frustration at
its inability to escape from its vicious circle of foreign debt.
   The team, headed by Finance Minister Hector Hurtado Navarro,
will try to convince banks in New York, Washington and San
Francisco to lend up to $3 billion to cover this year's estimated
$2.5 billion balance of payments deficit.
   The discussions could be rocky: as Venezuela blames its
inability to grow out of its economic problems on the weight of the
foreign debt, while foreign banks see its problem as one of lax
domestic policy.
   ``We understand that the debt is the Gordian knot of our current
(economic) situation and we have decided to cut it,'' President
Jaime Lusinchi stated emphatically in a televised address last week.
   The balance of payments deficit is the product of continued low
oil prices, which could limit income from Venezuela's main export
to just $8.2 billion this year.
   Scheduled payments on its $34 billion foreign debt, estimated at
$5 billion this year, will absorb 60 percent of that, severely
limiting the nation's prospects for growth in an election year.
   But the government is equally frustrated by the fact that
Venezuela paid over $30 billion in capital and interest between
1983, when its debt problems began, and last year, but its total
debt has remained virtually unchanged.
   Venezuelan officials claim commercial bank creditors have
reneged on a promise to provide Venezuela with new funds and help
it regain access to international financial markets.
   The nation's $20.34 billion foreign debt refinancing agreement,
first signed in 1986, was revised early in 1987 to allow for more
favorable terms _ including a clause in which banks promised to
``look favorably'' upon requests for new loans.
   But besides an estimated $3.5 billion in short-term lines of
credit and a $100 million issue of Republic of Venezuela bonds, no
new balance of payments loans have been made.
   ``Servicing the foreign debt (was) made under the promise that
financial flows would be renewed...(debt service) has been an
obligation that has limited our possibilities to eradicate our
crisis,'' Lusinchi said.
   The frustration has led to persistent rumors in recent weeks
that Venezuela might declare a unilateral debt payment moratorium,
as some government party members want.
   But Lusinchi and other top administration officials said any
suspension of payments would occur only if this week's mission
fails, and even then, only in concert with commercial banks.
   And Hurtado said before leaving for New York last weekend that
any new talks to seek more favorable terms on the refinanced debt
would begin only after a new administration takes office early next
year.
   ``A temporary suspension of payments (this year) is a far-off
possibility, but it is a possibility,'' said Domingo Maza Zavala, a
private economist who advises the government on economic policy.
   But government efforts to control the domestic impact of the
debt are showing signs of strain.
   Due to lack of sufficient income, government spending programs
designed to promote growth have been based on internal debt, which
has risen to 7 percent of gross domestic product, according to the
International Monetary Fund.
   The spending resulted in domestic growth of 5 percent in 1986,
for the first time in eight years. But growth slowed to 3 percent
last year and, according to private estimates, could be flat again
this year.
   Inflation, which the government hoped to limit to 15 percent
this year, already had topped 12 percent through July, and private
economists estimate it could reach 25 percent by December.
   And the free market exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, an
important indicator of local business psychology, zoomed last week
to more than 38 bolivars, a record level and nearly three times the
official exchange rate.
   Nevertheless, analysts feel the government has room to adopt
policies which would help solve the domestic imbalances, including
raising domestic interest rates and increasing fiscal revenues from
public services.
   The financial mission is armed with an outline of possible steps
the government could take in return for new cash.
   Foreign bankers say they probably would require such measures _
which would be similar to austerity guidelines often recommended by
the IMF _ as a condition of any new loans.
   Foreign bankers also say Venezuela should look for new money in
other places first, which usually means the IMF.
   But Venezuela is unlikely to want to change its policy of
avoiding an IMF connection in order to maintain the freedom to set
its own economic priorities.
   ``Politically, for a government ending its term and in an
electoral year, (going to the IMF) would be very, very difficult,''
said Maza Zavala.

<HEAD>CBS Agrees To Buy Independent TV Station in Miami</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc., flush with cash from sale of major
non-broadcasting assets, says it plans to look for more prospects
in the wake of its agreement to purchase an independent television
station in Miami for $59 million.
   CBS said Monday that its agreement to acquire WCIX-TV from TVX
Broadcast Group Inc. of Norfolk, Va., also calls for it to assume
certain program obligations, which a CBS spokesman said were valued
at about $13 million.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president, in announcing the deal said
``we are continuing to evaluate other potential properties with an
eye toward further acquisitions.''
   Financial analysts said the deal seemed good for CBS and Tisch,
who had been faulted for failing to buy more stations with the $3
billion amassed by selling assets such as its records and magazine
businesses.
   On Wall Street, CBS stock slipped 12{ cents a share to $162.87{
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The purchase of the station, which is subject to regulatory
approval, would allow CBS to maintain its presence in the
fast-growing Miami television market at only a fraction of the
price a network affiliate likely would have commanded. Miami is the
nation's 16th largest TV market.
   CBS was outbid last year in an effort to buy its Miami
affiliate, WTVJ, by General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting
Co., which offered $270 million. WTVJ still carries CBS programs
under an affiliation agreement that ends in January, when it is
expected to become an NBC affiliate.
   Peter Appert, a media analyst for the investment firm C.J.
Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., said the WCIX purchase ``looks like
an excellent deal.''
   ``They bought a new network affiliate station for an incredibly
low price,'' he said.
   Appert said independent stations command lower prices because
they have higher programming costs, attract smaller audiences and
generate lower advertising revenue. Affiliates get some programming
from the network and often can charge higher ad rates for programs
such as local news that may appear just before network programs, he
said.
   Barry Kaplan, media analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Co., said
buying an independent station ``might send a dangerous signal'' to
CBS affiliates who have a competing independent station in their
market.
   ``There might be a risk in any market where there is a VHF
independent,'' he said. A VHF station is one operating on Channels
2 through 13.
   But Philip Jones, vice president and general manager of KCTV in
Kansas City, Mo., and a former head of the CBS affiliates board,
said there were only a handful of markets where that situation
existed. ``It sounds to me like it's a smart buy,'' he said.
   Affiliates had been urging Tisch to buy a few stations to
demonstrate his commitment to the network. Tisch told them he
wanted to do so, but that the asking prices were too high.
   CBS owns television stations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago
and Philadelphia that reach 19.4 percent of the country's viewers.
With WCIX, its stations would reach 20.8 percent of the country.
   NBC's parent has seven stations reaching 22.4 percent of the
country; Capital Cities-ABC Inc. has eight stations reaching 24.4
percent.
   Federal Communications Commission regulations limit network
companies to owning a maximum of 12 stations reaching 25 percent of
the country.
   CBS also announced Monday that WPEC-TV in West Palm Beach, Fla.,
would become a CBS affiliate in January. The station is now an ABC
affiliate, and the signing is seen as helping CBS reach an audience
north of Miami where the WCIX signal is weak.

<HEAD>Dollar Steady In Calm European Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was holding steady in calm European
trading late this morning, and traders said they generally expect
the market to take a one-day breather before pushing the U.S.
currency higher.
   Gold prices fell.
   Traders said there was some light profit-taking following
Monday's gain, but that market sentiment still calls for a higher
dollar.
   ``The dollar is fundamentally strong. We could see just a minor
decline before it takes off again,'' one Rome trader said. ``We are
probably in a phase of rest in anticipation of a new rally.''
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7050, compared
with $1.7022 Monday.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8968 West German marks, down from 1.9000; 1.5850
Swiss francs, down from 1.5857; 6.3975 French francs, up from
6.3950; 2.1403 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1435; 1,399.40 Italian
lire, down from 1,399.50; 1.2105 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2097.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.39 yen to a closing 133.58 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 133.70 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $430.80 a troy ounce,
down from late Monday's $432.25. At mid-morning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $428.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $428.20, down from $432.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.39 to close at a bid $430.61.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.69 a troy
ounce, down from Monday's $6.78.

   The dollar edged down slightly against the Japanese
yen today, while share prices dropped for the third straight day on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   After opening at 133.62 yen, down from Monday's close of 133.97
yen, the dollar remained in a narrow range between 133.52 and
133.73 yen in slow trading. It closed at 133.58 yen, down 0.39 yen
from Monday's close.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 109.06-point loser Monday, lost 82.76 points, or
0.29 percent, to close at 28,170.36.
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was a light
650 million shares. The volume has plunged drastically since Monday
when it declined to 650 million shares, the first time the daily
volume traded fell below 1 billion shares since July 25.
   Dealers said investors were not active in the market because
Japan is entering a major holiday season.
   ``As seen in the low volume, the market is not moving
energetically and only limited shares are being traded,'' said a
dealer at a Tokyo securities firm, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``This situation will likely continue until mid-August.
   ``Most foreign fund managers seem to be out of town for vacation
and there are not many people left in Tokyo who can move a large
amount of funds,'' the dealer added.

<HEAD>Group Says Pollutants, Heat Create More Smog Than A Year Ago</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An environmental organization says smog got
worse this year in cities and counties from Maine to Louisiana, and
that while the hot, muggy summer is partly to blame,
ozone-producing pollutants are the root cause.
   ``Obviously, the weather is part of the problem,'' Dan Weiss,
Washington representative of the Sierra Club, said Monday in an
interview. ``But it's not the source. Blaming the weather for high
levels of pollution is like blaming the ground for a plane crash.
...
   ``The smoggy summer of '88 is an unpleasant preview of a dirty,
unhealthy future unless Congress strengthens the Clean Air Act by
restricting emissions from motor vehicles and industrial
polluters,'' he said.
   A Sierra Club survey found that through Aug. 3, 41 of 47 cities
and counties had peak ozone readings at least 25 percent greater
than the safe federal health standard, compared with 36 in this
category for all of 1987.
   The federal health standard for ozone is 0.12 parts per million.
Ozone, which causes respiratory problems, is formed when nitrogen
oxides and hydrocarbons combine in the presence of sunlight.
   The Sierra Club said the worst reading was 0.24 ppm in
Providence, R.I. New York City had a 0.21 ppm reading in 1988, but
this was well below its worst 1987 reading of 0.29 ppm, according
to the survey.
   Every city in the survey exceeded 0.12 ppm at least once.
   Nineteen areas exceeded the standard by 50 percent at least once
so far in 1988, up from 14 in 1987, while nine had at least one
reading 75 percent higher than the standard, up from four last
year, according to the survey.
   Thirty cities and counties exceeded the air-quality standard
more times through Aug. 3 than they had during all of 1987, the
survey said.
   The only western state surveyed, Texas, actually had better
readings than it had in 1987. The four Texas cities surveyed _
Beaumont, Dallas, El Paso and Houston _ showed improvements over
the previous air-quality readings.
   Weiss said the Sierra Club obtained the data through telephone
interviews with state and local air pollution control agencies,
which he said supply the same monitoring data to the Environmental
Protection Agency.

   Ten years after Love Canal was
declared a national disaster area because buried chemicals were
oozing to the surface, the largely abandoned neighborhood remains
at the center of environmental debate.
   The former chemical dump that forced hundreds of families from
their homes has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and
plastic liners to prevent chemicals from leaking into groundwater.
   Corroding drums of chemicals have been separated and complex
runoff monitoring and collection systems have been built.
   But even though the contamination has been largely contained and
state officials have begun to talk about restoring the neighborhood
to residential use, critics think Love Canal and hundreds of
similar sites throughout the nation will remain potential disasters
until a safe disposal method is found.
   ``We've spent the first 10 years catching up on the sins of the
past,'' acknowledged EPA spokesman James Marshall, who noted that
the discovery of Love Canal's threat was largely responsible for
federal toxic waste cleanup legislation.
   ``The future will have to be spent changing industrial processes
and people's attitudes about waste generation,'' Marshall said.
``In many ways the next 10 years will be more important than the
first.''
   Love Canal, an abandoned waterway project, was used by the
Hooker Chemical Co. to dispose of thousands of pounds of chemical
wastes in the 1940s. Hooker made herbicides and pesticides.
   In the 1950s, the canal and its contents were covered and homes
and an elementary school were built. It wasn't until the early
1970s that people began to notice foul smells in their basements
and oily puddles in their yards.
   They also began to notice higher-than-usual incidences of
miscarriages, birth defects, cancer, leukemia, neurological
disease, allergies, epilepsy and suicides.
   But government was slow to react. It took mass protests and town
meetings turned into near riots to prod the state into action.
   On Aug. 7, 1978, President Carter declared a state of emergency
at Love Canal.
   Eventually, 728 homes in a 50-block area were evacuated and the
elementary school and 228 of the houses were torn down.
   The state and federal governments filed multimillion-dollar
lawsuits against Hooker. The cases are still being pursued against
the company's parent, Occidental Chemical Corp.
   Today, inside the fenced dump, crews in protective suits carry
out small projects to shore up containment walls or check
monitoring wells.
   Outside the fence, houses are boarded up and decaying.
   A few are still inhabited.
   ``We always hoped they'd decide that it was safe to live here
and that things would return to normal one day,'' said William
Stevenson, a retiree who stayed in his house two blocks from the
dump site.
   Some 175 other families are awaiting the results of a state
habitability study before returning. State Health Commissioner
David Axelrod is to decide the habitability question this fall.
   If Axelrod determines that the area is habitable, the state will
have to assume liability for those who return, said former resident
Lois Gibbs, now a Washington-based environmental activist.
   ``Will the deeds carry health warning labels?'' she said.
   Gibbs said environmental groups would sue to block resettlement,
arguing that no one knows what levels of exposure to the chemicals
are safe.
   If Love Canal is declared unsafe, it would set a precedent for
people living around toxic waste dumps nationwide. The cost of
relocating those people and cleaning those dumps would be
astronomical, she said.
   The state, however, has vowed not to leave Love Canal a vacant
field as a symbol of environmental disaster.
   ``We have a vision of Love Canal as a usable landscape again,''
state Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas Jorling said
recently.
   EPA spokesman Marshall said habitability decisions are being
made across the country, though none are of the same magnitude as
Love Canal.
   ``No situation is risk free,'' he said. ``You can't expect to be
part of a highly developed, industrial society without weighing
risks and ultimately living with them.''

   Here are major events leading to Monday's
approval of a joint operating agreement for The Detroit News and
Detroit Free Press:
   May 9, 1986: The Free Press and News apply to the Justice
Department for a limited antitrust exemption allowing a
cost-cutting combination of advertising, circulation and business
operations while news and editorial departments remain separate.
   July 23, 1986: The Justice Department's antitrust division
recommends that Attorney General Edwin Meese II order a public
hearing, saying the papers have not proved the need for a JOA.
   Aug. 22, 1986: A deadline for public comment is extended after
Mayor Coleman Young, unions representing newspaper employees and
some members of Congress call for public hearings.
   Feb. 25, 1987: Meese says he will appoint an administrative law
judge to conduct a hearing.
   May 29, 1987: Young and five unions obtain 30,000 pages of
documents from the newspapers detailing cost-cutting efforts, loss
projections and other items.
   June 1, 1987: The Free Press and News file written testimony
saying the Free Press lost $17 million in 1986, the News lost $12.7
million, and cost cuts or price increases would not save the Free
Press.
   June 30, 1987: The challengers submit exhibits and testimony
that the Free Press does not meet the test of a failing newspaper.
   Aug. 3, 1987: Administrative Law Judge Morton Needelman begins a
hearing in Detroit.

testifies that the News will spend whatever is necessary to defeat
the Free Press if a JOA is denied.
   Aug. 12, 1987: Knight-Ridder Inc. Chairman Alvah H. Chapman Jr.
testifies that he will recommend closing the Free Press if a JOA is

<HEAD>Hunts' Lawyer: No Evidence of Silver Conspiracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense lawyer for Nelson Bunker Hunt says
there's no evidence that the Texas oil tycoon and his two brothers
were part of a plot to corner the world silver market nearly 10
years ago.
   Hunt and his two younger brothers are being sued for $150
million by a South American silver concern that claims the
Dallas-based Hunts manipulated the world silver market between 1979
and 1980.
   In his closing argument to the jury Monday at federal court in
Manhattan, Paul J. Curran noted that the Hunts lost more than $1
billion when the silver market collapsed in 1980.
   ``Where is the evidence they made a profit?'' Curran asked the
six-member civil jury. ``If they were part of a conspiracy, it was
one spectacular failure.''
   The Hunts' Placid Oil Co. and their three individual trusts,
which control Penrod Drilling Co., are in bankruptcy proceedings.
   Curran said the Hunts were victims just like other silver
investors.
   ``They believed too much in silver. They played and they paid,''
said Curran.
   Minpeco S.A., a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian
government, claims in a federal civil action that the brothers _
Nelson Bunker Hunt, 62; William Herbert Hunt, 59, who also has
extensive real estate holdings, and Lamar Hunt, 56, owner of the
National Football League Kansas City Chiefs _ conspired
unsuccessfully with several Middle East businessmen to corner the
world silver market.
   The trial before U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker began in
February.
   Lawyers for Minpeco claim the Hunts and their Middle Eastern
co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices
from about $9 an ounce to more than $50 an ounce between September
1979 and January 1980.
   Minpeco had a large short position in the silver futures market,
which meant it would make money on dropping silver prices and lose
money on rising prices.
   Minpeco claimed it lost more than $100 million due to
skyrocketing silver prices that fell back to about $10 an ounce in
March 1980.
   Six financial institutions accused of participating in the
alleged conspiracy have settled with Minpeco for a total of $64.6
million.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Postal Service will offer a new type
of pre-stamped envelope this year, hoping to pick up some extra
holiday business.
   The envelope is to be produced in a new, 5-inch by 7{-inch size,
which officials say will accommodate many cards, invitations and
similar items.
   The envelopes will be pre-printed with 25-cent first-class
postage in the form of an embossed snowflake, white on a green
background. It will also carry the statement ``First Class'' in
green and ``25 USA'' and the legend ``Holiday Greetings'' printed
in red.
   The new envelopes, the first new size to be issued in a
quarter-century, will go on sale Sept. 8 in Snowflake, Ariz., and
the following day in the rest of the country.
   The price will be 30 cents per envelope, although discounts will
drop the cost to about 27 cents on quantities of 500 or more. In
addition, the envelopes can be ordered with a pre-printed return
address for an added fee.

<HEAD>London Shares Lower At Midday In Quiet Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were a bit lower across the board
around midday Tuesday, with speculative activity providing the only
excitement to an otherwise dull market.
   ``There is just very little business around in the market,'' one
dealer said. ``Everybody's got flat books and no one cares which
way the market goes.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 2.9
points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,873.1 at about 12:30 p.m., just 0.3
point below its best level for the day.
   The index fluctuated in negative territory all morning, moving
down as much as 7.3 points at one point.
   Volume was a light 222.1 million shares at midday, compared with
189.3 million shares at the same time Monday.
   A half-point increase in the British commercial banks' base
lending rate to 11 percent on Monday, which hadn't been expected
and was the seventh rise since early June, apparently made
investors reluctant to continue buying shares.
   At the same time, there was little selling pressure, dealers
said.
   With activity in most stocks sharply reduced, attention turned
to speculative situations, giving a boost to selected shares, they
said.

   ElDorado Motor Corp. plans to sell its
small-bus manufacturing division to a recreational vehicle producer
in Ohio.
   The Minneaopolis-based company, which employs about 600 people,
has reached an agreement in principle to sell the division to Thor
Industries for an undisclosed amount.
   The bus division accounted for about $28 million of ElDorado's
$75.5 million in sales during fiscal year 1987, said Gregory
Stewart, company president. ElDorado makes small and midsize buses
such as airport and rental car company shuttle buses.
   Stewart said the company expected to lose money in the fiscal
year that ended June 30. The company lost $106,000 in 1987.
   Thor, which is based in Jackson Center, Ohio, had profits of
$12.6 million on sales of $165 million in 1987.
   Stewart said that Thor did not plan to move the bus division out
of Minneapolis.

<HEAD>Insurers Slash Cargo Rates in Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurers on Tuesday slashed by up to 33 percent
their rates for insuring cargoes in the Persian Gulf, following the
announcement of a firm date for a cease-fire between Iran and Iraq.
   The cuts are the first since the possibility of a cease-fire
between the two countries was announced three weeks ago.
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on
Monday announced that the truce would begin Aug. 20.
   The Lloyd's of London insurance market and the Institute of
London Underwriters announced that the insurance rate for cargoes
going to most places in Iran was cut to 0.375 percent of the value
of the shipment, effective immediately, from 0.5 percent.
   The rate for insuring oil going to both the northern and
southern areas of the Gulf was cut to 0.25 percent from 0.375
percent of its value.
   Rates for air cargo to Iran and Iraq also were reduced to 0.25
percent from 0.375 percent.
   The two institutions' joint War Risks Rating Committee said,
``The reductions have been made in consequence of the recent
substantial improvement in the casualty experience and the
encouraging news concerning efforts to bring an end to the fighting.
   ``It is anticipated that a further review will take place when
it becomes clear that an effective cease-fire has been agreed.''
   David Larner, a spokesman for Lloyd's said, ``One could expect
them to come down further if the cease-fire is seen to hold.''

<HEAD>Japanese Company First Foreign Firm to Lease Land in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese company on Monday became the first
foreign firm to ``buy'' land from the Chinese government in public
tender bidding.
   The official Xinhua news agency said Sun Enterprises Ltd. of
Japan beat out five other firms to win rights to use a
12,900-square-meter (139,320-square-foot) plot in Shanghai's
Hongqiao economic development zone for 50 years.
   The report said the company will pay 104.16 million yuan ($28
million) for the land. It plans to construct apartment and office
buildings, restaurants, stores and recreational facilities there.
   The selling of land-use rights is the latest, and one of the
more controversial, measures taken by the Beijing government to
raise badly needed capital for economic development.
   Last month the city of Shenzhen, a special economic zone across
the border from Hong Kong, held China's first land auction, with
two Chinese companies winning the bidding for property development
sites.
   Land in socialist China technically all belongs to the state,
but economists are now arguing that a market in land-use rights
will bring in needed capital, bring about a more efficient use of
land and speed up urban development.
   In the countryside, family farms that were rehabilitated with
the start of agricultural reforms in 1979 usually have 10- to
15-year contracts for farming a plot of land, but normally do not
pay rent to the state.
   In the cities, most Chinese factories and buildings occupy land
without charge for unlimited periods.
   The National People's Congress, China's legislature, paved the
way for land-use sales last April when it amended the constitution
to eliminate a prohibition against leasing land and added the
sentence ``land-use rights according to legal regulation can be
transferred.''
   Some rural areas now allow residents not using their land to
lease it to more ambitious farmers needing larger tracts. The
government at the end of last year also named seven urban areas
that may experiment with land-use sales: Shenzhen, Shanghai,
Canton, Tianjin, Hainan, Fuzhou and Xiamen.
   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, however, stressed
recently that public ownership will remain dominant in China. His
statement appeared to be meant to assuage other party leaders
worried that China was losing its socialist character with the
emergence of thriving private enterprises and the selling of state
land.

<TEXT>
   The owners of The Detroit News and Detroit Free
Press praised the attorney general's decision to allow a partial
merger of the newspapers, while employees toasted their reprieve
from ``death row.''
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Monday granted the
newspapers' application to combine their business, production and
circulation departments. He said without a partial merger, the Free
Press, the nation's 10th-largest newspaper in terms of circulation,
could not stem the losses that had brought it to the brink of
failure.
   ``Keen competition aimed at market domination and future
profitability _ competition waged energetically but both
responsibly and properly _ has moved both newspapers into
intractable loss positions from which only one, the News, now
appears to have any reasonable prospect of emerging,'' said Meese,
who is scheduled to leave office in mid-August.
   Directors of Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the Free Press, had
threatened to close the newspaper unless Meese approved the joint
operating agreement. Gannett Co. Inc.'s News, the nation's
eighth-largest newspaper, had a daily circulation lead of about
40,000 in March.
   ``This decision reaffirms the will of the Congress that two
independent editorial voices should be preserved wherever possible
in the cities of America,'' said Alvah H. Chapman Jr.,
Knight-Ridder chairman.
   Gannett Chairman Allen Neuharth and Gannett President John J.
Curley said they, too, were gratified.
   ``We said all along that the JOA was the only way to preserve
two independent news and editorial voices,'' they said in a
statement from Gannett headquarters in Arlington, Va. ``The
attorney general's decision is in the best interest of the
community, the readers, the advertisers and the employees.''
   Free Press employees toasted the decision with champagne in
plastic cups.
   ``It was like a rush. Waiting for the decision is like living on
death row,'' said Senior Managing Editor Neal Shine, who had been
assigned to write the newspaper's obituary if the partial merger
had been denied.
   The Newspaper Guild Local 22 , which was the last union to
formally drop its opposition to the JOA after it gained improved
economic terms, was still critical of Meese's decision.
   ``This is a travesty of the Newspaper Preservation Act,'' said
Lou Mleczko, a reporter at the News and president of the union,
which has 1,100 members at the two newspapers.
   ``I feel it would have been an extraordinary tragedy if this
paper died,'' said David Lawrence Jr., publisher of the
157-year-old Free Press.
   Meese rejected recommendations by the department's antitrust
division and by an administrative law judge that the agreement be
turned down.
   They had concluded that the newspapers' losses resulted from
pricing decisions and could be reduced if the newspapers raised
prices to cover the cost of operating.
   Meese, however, said the Free Press, with a 20-cent newsstand
price in the Detroit area, already was 5 cents higher than the
News'. ``There is thus no competitive advantage to be gained by
Knight-Ridder from a unilateral increase in prices,'' Meese said.
   The joint operating agreement was the fifth approved by the
Justice Department under the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970,
which allows limited antitrust exemption to preserve independent
editorial voices in a community where one newspaper is in danger of
failing.
   Previous partial mergers were approved for newspapers in
Anchorage, Alaska, in 1974, Cincinnati in 1979, Chattanooga, Tenn.,
in 1980 and Seattle in 1982.
   Under the 100-year joint operating agreement, the Free Press
will publish on weekday mornings and the News on weekday afternoons.
   The newspapers will split responsibilities on weekends, when a
combined edition called ``The Detroit News and Free Press'' will be
published.
   The agreement means a maximum 500 people at both papers could
loose their jobs, Lawrence said. A significant number have
indicated they will take early retirement, helping to hold down the
layoffs, Lawrence said.
   Profits or losses the first five years of the agreement will be
split under a sliding formula, beginning with 55 percent for
Gannett and 45 percent for Knight-Ridder. Thereafter, profits and
losses will be split equally between the two corporations.
   According to estimates released by Knight-Ridder in January, the
Free Press' operating losses had totaled $100 million since 1979,
and that the News had lost about $75 million in the same period.
   The Free Press circulation in March was 647,763 daily and
721,676 on Sundays, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation.
The News' circulation was 688,211 daily and 836,331 on Sundays, the
bureau said.
   The Free Press was founded in 1831 and purchased by a
predecessor of Knight-Ridder in 1940. The News was founded in 1873
and purchased by Gannett in 1986.

   The stock market moved sharply lower today in
reaction to news that the Federal Reserve boosted its key bank
lending rate, but then recovered somewhat.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell about 23
points following the announcement, was off 10.66 at 2,096.73 in the
first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 346 issues up, 469
down and 585 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 56.49 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Fed announced it was hiking the discount rate to 6.5 percent
from 6 percent shortly after the market opened. The increase, which
traders had been anticipating, marks the first change in the rate
since Sept. 7 and put the rate at its highest in more than two
years.
   The Fed, in a statement, said its decision ``reflects the intent
of the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures'' and ``was
taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over
the discount rate.''
   The boost is expected to send a variety of other interest rates
higher, including those on credit cards and mortgages.
   Analysts said they expected an initial selloff following the
news but were cautiously optimistic that the market could weather
the increase.
   ``Since last week's unemployment figures, we've been hearing the
drumbeat that the Fed would have to tighten,'' said Larry Wachtel,
first vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Now
we'll wait to see whether the Street prepared for it.''
   Last week the Labor Department reported better-than-expected
employment data for July and also revised June data upward.
   Among actively traded issues, General Electric was unchanged at
41{; Boeing was off { at 60; IBM was off ] at 122}, and American
Express was unchanged at 28.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.92 to 151.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.21 at 303.02.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 11.73 to
2,107.40.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 565 up, 774 down and 589 unchanged. Big Board volume
came to 148.80 million shares, against 113.40 million in the
previous session.

   Analysts said they expected an initial selloff following the
news but were cautiously optimistic that the market could digest
the increase in a matter of days.
   ``Some (investors) already are reacting positively, feeling that
the sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patient
will recover,'' said Michael Metz, vice president and technical
anlayst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   With the dollar was up sharply on the announcement, analysts
predicted more foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominated
instruments and support stocks and bonds.
   While analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the
money supply this week, few expected a change in the discount rate,
which is the most dramatic move the Fed can take. Most were
anticipating the Fed to push up the federal funds rate, the
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   ``The feeling was that the Fed would use the federal funds rate
rather than take this sudden, draconian measure,'' Metz said.
   He noted, however, that the action ``enhances the credibility of
the Fed'' among those who thought the central bank would refrain
from making any decisive move before November's presidential
election.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to a private crop
analyst's prediction of a sharp drop in corn and soybean production.
   The widely-followed analyst Conrad Leslie of Chicago pegged 1988
soybean production at 1.48 billion bushels, compared with actual
production of 1.91 billion bushels last year. Leslie estimated U.S.
corn production this year at 4.28 billion bushels, compared with
7.06 billion bushels harvested last year.
   Leslie's numbers fell near the low end of other private
estimates that have been released in advance of the Agriculture
Department's estimate on Thursday. In its July crop report, the
USDA pegged 1988 soybean production at 1.65 billion bushels and
corn production at 5.2 billion bushels.
   Although traders are eagerly awaiting the USDA report, which
will be based crop conditions as of Aug. 1, the official numbers
may have little market impact, said Cathy Leow, an assistant vice
president in charge of grain futures trading at Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc. in New York.
   ``When the USDA comes out with its number, people are most
likely going to say it's too high because the survey was taken
prior to the extreme heat we experienced last week,'' Ms. Leow said.
   In early trading, wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.80 a bushel; corn was 2{
cents to 3 cents higher with September at $2.99 a bushel; oats were
1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with September at $2.74 a bushel; and
soybeans were 3{ cents to 14 cents higher with August at $8.54 a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed
in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .30 cent to .40 cent higher with August at
68.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .43 cent
higher with August at 79.60 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower
to .30 cent higher with August at 45.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .10 cent lower to 1 cent higher with August at 33.15
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Monday.

   At the end of a dusty, mile-long road to
nowhere, James and Carolyn Robertson walk across a field to their
barn each morning and generate their harvest by hand.
   You can probably find their ``produce'' at your corner bookstore.
   The Robertsons, who left urban pressures behind 14 years ago for
the solitude of rural Mendocino County, are living out their dreams
with tiny but highly regarded Yolla Bolly Press.
   ``People are fascinated by the fact that two grownups would be
out in the woods making books by hand by 19th-century methods,''
said Jim Robertson.
   The wonderment is natural for any visitor making the 175-mile
trek from San Francisco to Round Valley, a remote farming plateau
tucked amid the mountains of California's Coast Ranges.
   Thirty miles from the nearest town of any size and almost an
hour from a major highway, Yolla Bolly Press sits next to pasture
land in a spot better suited for a sheep barn than a printing barn.
   The Robertsons call it their ``book farm.''
   ``I had a dream long ago about a print shop in a garden, and
Carolyn had a dream about a cabin in the woods,'' explained Jim,
53. ``We care deeply about books and are devoting our lives to
them.''
   The press was christened with an Indian name meaning ``high
snowy peak,'' for the 8,000-foot mountains of the nearby Yolla
Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness. Its logo is an Indian design
commemorating the tree frog, which frequents the Robertsons' 40
acres along with mountains lions, bears and the deer that nap daily
in the shade of their guest cabin.
   The choice of a distinctive name was meant to catch the
attention of bookworms and the publishing community. It has.
   Only about two dozen book printers in the United States use the
letterpress printing method _ pressing raised-surface type onto
paper _ instead of the less costly, more modern offset method.
Experts say Yolla Bolly, which also produces trade books for
commercial publishers, compares favorably with any maker of finely
printed books.
   ``They're absolutely among the country's top producers of fine,
limited-edition books _ books that are a combination of craft, art
and literature,'' said Sandra Kirshenbaum, editor of Fine Print, a
San Francisco quarterly magazine.
   Jim got an early start in the profession. Fascinated by print
shops as a boy growing up in Alameda on San Francisco Bay, he
received a tiny, hand-operated press and a case of type from his
father one birthday. By the seventh grade, he was running a
neighborhood newspaper called ``The Pearl Street Gazette'' _
circulation 15 or 20.
   He went on to run a graphic-design business for about 15 years
before returning to publishing.
   Carolyn, 46, grew up a book lover in Salt Lake City. With a
background in English literature and business management, she
applied for work in Jim's San Francisco office one day in 1968 and
got the job and more.
   Ultimately they founded Yolla Bolly five years later, before
moving to Covelo in 1974 in the interest of peace, quiet and
affordability. Today, Carolyn handles the business side, Jim is
responsible for the printing and they share editing and design
responsibilities.
   ``We live on the edge'' in a ``wild and wonderful place,'' is
how Carolyn describes their remote, idyllic setup.
   Yolla Bolly runs on equipment valued at a mere $25,000 _ four
letterpresses dating back 75 years, two hand-operated proofing
presses and one small offset press.
   But the two or three fine books produced each year command
premium prices from collectors.
   The most recent was ``My First Summer in the Sierra,''
commemorating the 150th anniversary of naturalist John Muir's
birthday last April. The press published 110 limited-edition
volumes for $785 each, and 25 special-edition volumes for $1,150.
   Months of preparation includes choosing the artist and preparing
the art, buying high-quality paper from mills in Italy and choosing
California latigo saddle leather or perhaps Amish horse denim for
the binding.
   The price restricts the audience for the limited-edition books
by Muir, Joaquin Miller, Robinson Jeffers and others. But the care
that goes into making them ensures they are likely to be kept for a
long time.
   Jim Robertson sees books as ``icons'' that represent what is
valued in a culture.
   ``You can make a thing _ a book or a house or a camera _ in such
a way that it commands respect,'' he said.
   ``I hate to think that the only people who care about the way
things are made are a couple of oddball craftsmen out in the woods.
The culture needs the attitude of making things with purpose,
attention to detail and a certain kind of love.''
   Because the printing of fine books can be a risky business,
Yolla Bolly also acts as an independent producer for four or five
commercial books a year.
   It does the design and preparation work and ships the books off
to major publishers such as Sierra Club Books and Houghton Mifflin
Co.; best-selling Yolla Bolly Books include ``Mountain Light,''
``The View From The Oak'' and ``Stranger in the Forest.''
   The Robertsons hope to continue their mix of artistic and
commercial work as long as readers keep buying.
   ``We consider ourselves very lucky to live in a place like this,
do the things we care about and make a living,'' Jim Robertson said.

   Crocodile Dundee might prefer to knock
back a beer, but wine drinkers around the world are toasting their
fascination with life Down Under by sipping more Australian wine
than ever before.
   The explosion of interest in Australia's premium labels has
resulted in some shortages and higher prices, as vintners struggle
to keep pace with rising demand both here and overseas.
   Frost and hailstorms in some parts of South Australia prior to
the 1988 vintage also have cut into supplies.
   ``Many Australians are drinking better quality wine,'' said
leading wine writer Huon Hooke of the Sydney Morning Herald. ``They
want quality product, but much of that product is committed
overseas.''
   Contributing to the popularity of Aussie wines is the general
bull market for things Australian, including actor Paul Hogan and
his carefree Crocodile Dundee character. Ironically, Hogan can be
seen in American television commercials, turning up his nose to
fine wine tasting in favor of a frothy glass of beer.
   Also aiding the Australian industry is a trend away from
European wines after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster sparked fears
of fallout across Europe and scandals over illegal additives
scarred the Austrian wine industry.
   Statistics show domestic consumers are drinking a better class
of wine and deserting the taditional cask, or boxed wine. Wine
sales in a country previously noted for its beer drinking have
doubled over the past decade to 329 million liters last year.
   The increased popularity of premium wines has led to price rises
of up to 30 percent locally and arguments from Australian retailers
that producers should supply the local market ahead of the
lucrative export markets of Sweden, the United States and Britain.
   The winemakers, looking to the future, are continuing to export
enthusiastically.
   Australian wine is a competitor for Californian wine in many
markets. It is particularly popular in northern Europe, accounting
for 10 percent of all wine imports into Sweden _ 7 million liters
in the 1986-87 financial year.
   Britain imported 4.5 million liters that year, and the figure is
expected to rise considerably in 1987-88.
   The Australian Wine and Brandy Corp., the government-funded
marketing authority, said exports to Japan were up 62 percent last
year to 2.7 million liters.
   ``Dollar for dollar we offer the best value quality wine
available around the world,'' said Brian McGuigan, managing
director of the high-profile Wyndham Estate Group.
   The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that wine exports
now total over 30 million liters annually, almost 10 percent of the
total production.
   ``We are having great difficulty in meeting the demand for our
wines,'' said Jim Williams, director of trading for Penfolds, which
makes Grange Hermitage, Australia's world-class red wine. Penfolds
is the largest winemaking group in Australia and the largest
exporter.
   Grapes have been grown in Australia since the first fleet of
convict settlers arrived from England in 1788. The industry has
been revolutionized over the past 20 years with the introduction of
new technology, which led to the production of high-quality table
wines.
   ``But there is a great deal of resentment in the United
Kingdom,'' warned Chris Anstee, a spokesman for the Lindemans
Group. ``Dealers feel they are being cheated, having made an
initial investment in promoting Australian wine and being told
Australia cannot meet the demand.''
   That echoes complaints at home.
   ``Countries like Argentina and Chile are ready to service our
consumers if the local industry can't meet local demands,'' said
Lance Hogan, a buyer for a bulk distribution company.
   Industry analysts predict the under-supply of premium products,
which retail from around $5 U.S. domestically, could last for three
to four years. They also predict exports could rise to 25 percent
of production within five years.
   But some experts in the industry believe the current premium
shortage will be short-lived and has been aggravated by the unusual
weather.
   ``We have better, cheaper land here than anywhere in the
northern hemisphere and our production costs are less,'' said
McGuigan.
   ``The current shortage, mainly of Chardonnay, is a temporary
aberration. With the potential we have, we can't afford to stand
still. We are the world's vineyard of the future.''
   There are now some 500 wineries spread across the country. Among
the premier wine-producing districts are the Barossa and Clare
valleys and McLaren Vale in South Australia, the Yarra Valley in
Victoria and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. There are
numerous other small areas where grapes are grown.
   Despite tight supplies, some winemakers believe now is the time
to cultivate new customers. The Rosemount Estate Group, headed by
former international winemaker of the year Philip Shaw, has set up
offices in Ignacio, Calif., and Britain, and is currently exporting
to Japan, Canada and Sweden, among others.
   ``Rosemount is actively pursuing export markets,'' said managing
director Chris Hancock.
   Gordon Grant, managing director of the Ryecroft Company,
believes there are still huge opportunities for Australian makers,
particularly in the United States market.
   ``People overseas rarely know if they are eating Australian
beef, or wearing Australian wool, but our wine is seen as an
Australian product,'' said Grant. ``It is an ambassador in a
glass.''

<TEXT>
   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. was
trying to determine what its options are today after the Interstate
Commerce Commission approved the sale of the Southern Pacific
Railroad to Rio Grande Industries.
   Kansas City Southern, which had offered to buy the Southern
Pacific, could challenge the ICC ruling in court but the company's
president and chief executive officer, Landon Rowland, said no
decision has been made on what the next step, if any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' Rowland told reporters after
the ICC vote in Washington, D.C.
   Rio Grande Industries has agreed to buy the Southern Pacific
from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. for $1.2 billion. Kansas City
Southern has offered to buy Southern Pacific for $1.25 billion.
   But the ICC in a 4-0 vote said the merger of the Southern
Pacific and the Denver & Rio Grande Western railroads would have
the best competitive results and be in the public interest.
   The commission last year ordered the Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp. to divest itself of the Southern Pacific after the rejection
of that railroad's merger with the Santa Fe.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries,
but when permission for the sale was sought from the ICC, Kansas
City Southern objected and sought to buy Southern Pacific as well.
   In a series of votes today, the ICC turned its back on the
Kansas City Southern proposal and approved the sale to Rio Grande
Industries instead.
   Meanwhile, a three-judge court is scheduled to meet Friday in
Kansas City to consider KCSI's application for a stay of a recent
order barring the company from completing its efforts to purchase
Southern Pacific, according to Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Pasco Bowman.
   Bowman told attorneys in Kansas City that when a South Dakota
judge Friday prohibited the company from buying Southern Pacific,
he also delayed the prohibition from taking effect until after it
could be appealed.
   Bowman's observation came after a short hearing Monday morning.
He said a temporary stay on the prohibition, preventing it from
taking effect, was to last until next Tuesday.
   A federal judge in Sioux Falls, S.D., last week blocked KCSI
from buying Southern Pacific Railroad. Judge John B. Jones said
Kansas City Southern could not buy Southern Pacific while it is
appealing a $600 million judgment the state of South Dakota has
against Kansas City Southern.
   The judge ruled for South Dakota officials, who argued that the
purchase might jeopardize the recovery of their judgment in the
anti-trust lawsuit.
   But Kansas City Southern officials say the purchase would
enhance the value of their company, rather than harm it.
   South Dakota won the judgment in a suit alleging Kansas City
Southern helped kill a $3.8 billion coal-slurry pipeline that would
have helped the state's economy. The state contended Kansas City
Southern worked against the project because it would have hurt the
railroad's business.
   The pipeline plan was dropped in 1984.

<HEAD>Unfair Competition Domestically</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unfair competition of late has become associated
with trade restrictions that limit access of American manufacturers
to foreign markets. But it isn't always so.
   You don't need to leave these shores to find it; unfair
practices occur with regularity on the domestic business scene,
sometimes with the blessing of high government officials.
   Potentially, one of the biggest such scrapes of all involves
three of the nation's biggest institutions, the U.S. government,
General Motors Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.
   In a blistering complaint to government, GM asserts that the
federal government, among other things, held it to a higher set of
standards than required of IBM, which helped IBM bid lowest to win
a $3.6 billion contract.
   After the award, GM's Hughes Aircraft Co. said it discovered the
government allowed IBM to include used computer equipment in its
bid while telling Hughes it could use only new equipment.
   Earlier this year, GM challenged a U.S. Postal Service award to
Perot Systems Corp. involving a quest for postal savings that would
be made by Perot over a 10-year period. The reason: The award was
made without bidding.
   GM has won the first round in that battle, with the General
Services Administration ruling the award was granted to Perot ``in
the face of clear knowledge that other companies existed with
competency in this sort of work.''
   In the past, the combatants in such disputes over government
contracts often involved big companies vs. small, with the latter
charging that government specifications put small businesses at a
disadvantage.
   Legislation has alleviated much of the problem, but some
small-business organizations still contend that specifications,
such as for quantities of a product or delivery times, still put
them at a disadvantage.
   An area of continued friction involves tax-exempt, non-profit
organizations such as museums and universities that compete with
small businesses in the commercial marketplace.
   This competition may be getting worse, and could result in
legislation.
   It arises partly from the fact that since 1946, non-profits have
increased from about 100,000 to more than 860,000, and from growing
financial pressures on many of these institutions.
   It manifests itself in myriad ways: In a museum that publishes a
slick magazine; a college bookstore that sells apparel, furniture
or travel services; a hospital that operates a pharmacy, gift shop
or health spa.
   While this competition between profit-seeking and non-profit
operations seems to be growing more intense, the definitions that
separate them seem insufficient to the purpose.
   As they exist, the tax laws allow a non-profit organization to
engage in commercial activities not subject to taxes if the
activities are ``substantially related'' to the purpose of the
non-profit institution.
   Such wording, it is argued, is more an invitation to lawyers and
suits, than a guide for business.
   Operators of small businesses complain that the ability of
non-profits to exist without justifying themselves financially
gives them an enormous competitive advantage, which is then
compounded by their freedom from taxes.
   Adding to the frustration, they say, is ``halo effect'' of
non-profits, or the widespread perception among the public that
non-profits, by their very nature, have qualities superior to
commercial operations.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board announced today it
is boosting its key bank lending rate from 6 percent to 6.5
percent, raising the possibility that other interest rates,
including those on credit cards and mortgages, will go higher too.
   The Fed, in a statement, said its decision ``reflects the intent
of the Federal Reserve to reduce inflationary pressures'' and ``was
taken in light of the growing spread of market interest rates over
the discount rate.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan
administration officials were disappointed by the action.
   It was the first change in the central bank's discount rate
since Sept. 4 and put the rate at its highest in more than two
years.
   The increase, effective immediately, set the discount rate,
which is the fee the Fed charges to make loans to U.S. financial
institutions, at its highest level since April 21, 1986, when it
fell to 6.5 percent from 7 percent.
   Analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the money
supply this week, but few were expecting an increase in the
discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the Fed can take.
   Most were expecting the Fed to push up the federal funds rate,
the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans, by an
eighth or a quarter of a percentage point from its current 7.75
percent.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc., a Lexington,
Mass., consulting firm, said he had not expected a discount rate
increase from the Fed board, all appointees of President Reagan,
until after the November elections. But, he said, the Fed acted now
rather than in the fall, when the GOP presidential campaign of Vice
President George Bush is in full swing.
   ``I think the timing is very deliberate to do it before the
Republican convention. That's sort of the kick off for the
Republican political ampaign and raising the discount rate now may
be seen as better than interrupting the campaign,'' Wyss said.
   Reagan's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the White House was
``naturally ... disappointed.'' But he also told reporters:
   ``The Federal Reserve has had the task of trying to balance the
resistance to inflationary pressures with maintenance of real
growth in the economy. ... We believe the Federal Reserve has been
doing a good job of balancing these interests.''
   The likely negative effects of the hike include pushing up the
value of the dollar, which could slow the improvement of the U.S.
trade deficit, Wyss said. The dollar has been appreciating against
foreign currencies since early this year and now stands at an
18-month high against the West German mark. It was the previous
fall in the value of the dollar that shrank the trade deficit.
   Wyss also said that the increase now will likely make government
borrowing this week more costly. The Treasury Department, in its
quarterly auctions, plans to sell $11 billion in 10-year notes
today and $11 billion in three-year notes on Wednesday.
   Tuesday's discount rate increase marked the second under the
reign of Alan Greenspan, who took over as Fed chairman a year ago.
In September, the central bank boosted the rate from 5.5 percent to
6 percent, the first increase in three years.
   That move was also taken in response to inflationary fears, but
was later cited by some analysts as a contributing factor to the
October stock market crash.
   After the crash, the Fed pumped liquidity into the banking
system. It loosened money supplies again in mid-winter, when rising
business inventories raised concern that the economy was softening.
   Since then, however, government statistics have portrayed a
strong economy and concern has shifted from recession to inflation.
Tight labor markets in some areas of the country has been sparking
worry about inflationary increases in wages. Some economists say
steadily rising factory operating rates are likely to contribute to
rising prices for manufactured goods.
   Last month, Greenspan said in congressional testimony that the
Fed ``at this juncture might be well advised to err more on the
side of restrictiveness rather than of stimulus.''
   At that hearing, before the Senate Banking Committee on July 13,
Greenspan had played down the prospect of an immediate increase in
the discount rate after he was asked if he were worried about the
growing gap between the discount rate and the federal funds rate,
which had been increased in a series of small steps since late
March.
   Greenspan replied that ``current relationships are
satisfactory'' and noted that the spread had been greater in the
past.
   Too great a spread between the rates tempts banks to misuse the
``discount window'' by borrowing from the Fed and lending to other
banks.
   In its statement today, the Federal Reserve Board said it
increased the discount rate in response to requests from Federal
Reserve banks in Boston; New York; Philadelphia; Cleveland;
Richmond, Va.; Atlanta; St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo., and San
Francisco.
   As inflationary concerns have mounted in financial markets,
other interest rates, including mortgage rates, have been
increasing. The prime rate, the rate charged by banks to their most
creditworthy customers, was raised by most major banks on July 14
from 9 percent to 9.5 percent, its highest since March 1986.
   Wyss said a further increase in the prime rate could come this
week.
   Among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the July
unemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows.
In addition, the monthly trade deficits for April and May were the
lowest in nearly three years.
   Prior to September, the last increase in the discount rate had
come April 6, 1984, when the rate was boosted from 8.5 percent to 9
percent.
   The rate was then cut seven successive times, with the last
reduction on Aug. 20, 1986, when it dropped from 6 percent to 5.5
percent, the lowest level in nearly a decade.

   President Reagan will sign the $3.9 billion
drought relief bill after the House gives final approval to it, the
White House announced today.
   ``Farmers now know that assistance is on the way,'' Fitzwater
said in confirming Reagan's expected approval.
   The announcement was unusual, since the White House ordinarily
does not say what action the president will take on a bill until
after it has reached his desk.
   Fitzwater said plans were not complete, but a ceremony would
probably be held in connection with the signing of the bill.
   The Senate gave its assent Monday on a 92-0 vote. Just a few
minutes earlier, the House cleared the way for expedited
consideration of the measure, which could come as early as today.
   ``There's no question about passage,'' Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, said Monday.
``It's just by how many votes.''
   The measure _ the biggest federal emergency relief bill ever
passed for farmers _ is aimed at the hundreds of thousands of
farmers and ranchers who have been buffeted by one of the worst
droughts in the nation's history. Growers in the Eastern cornbelt
and the Northern plains have been hit particularly hard.
   According to the Department of Agriculture, 43 percent of the
country was suffering from severe or extreme drought in mid-July,
the fourth worst percentage since the government began keeping the
statistics in 1895. The highest measurement was made in 1934, when
61 percent of the nation's area was similarly parched.
   The government estimated last month that the country's corn crop
will be down from a normal year by 29 percent, barley production
down 42 percent, oats down 43 percent and spring wheat down 51
percent.
   The Agriculture Department has estimated that the government's
regular farm payments would be about $7 billion lower than expected
this year _ not including the cost of this bill _ because of the
drought. Supporters of the legislation say those savings will more
than pay for the costs of the assistance.
   President Reagan is expected to sign the bill quickly.
Department of Agriculture officials say they believe it will take
about two months for the assistance to reach the farmers.
   Governors from farm states, meeting at the National Governor's
Association conference in Cincinnati, unanimously approved a
resolution Monday praising Congress for the quick action.
   ``The legislation that Congress is set to pass is excellent,
far-reaching legislation that provides assistance to livestock and
crop producers,'' the resolution by the governors' Committee on
Agriculture and Rural Development said.
   The legislation would let growers who lose up to 35 percent of
their crops because of the drought keep the ``deficiency payments''
they have already received in advance. Normally, they have to repay
the government if crop prices rise, as they have because of the
drought.
   Farmers losing more than 35 percent of their crop would be
entitled to an emergency payment of 65 percent of their expected
federal subsidy or of the anticipated market price of the crop, up
to $100,000. Those farmers, however, would have to repay their
advance deficiency payments.
   Farmers would receive aid covering 90 percent of their
drought-caused damage for all losses they suffer beyond
three-fourths of their crop.
   Farmers who raise food animals, such as livestock and poultry,
would get federal help in paying for up to half the costs of
replacement feed bought during the drought if they normally grow
their own. The dry weather has driven up the prices of grain that
farmers must feed their herds.
   The measure would not provide assistance to food animal
producers who normally buy their feed, rather than raising their
own.
   The government would be allowed to sell its own low-cost feed to
farmers, donate feed to producers unable to buy it and reimburse
farmers for up to half of some of their feed transportation costs
and their expenses for deepening their wells.
   Dairy price-support levels would be raised in April through June
1989 by 50 cents, to $11.10, for each 100 pounds of milk. A 50-cent
reduction in the price support, planned for Jan. 1, would be
abandoned.
   The secretary of agriculture would be empowered to begin a
program for aiding producers of ethanol, a fuel additive, by
permitting them to buy cheaper, government-owned corn. The
Agriculture Department would be allowed to make 12 million bushels
of corn available for the program.
   To help the government recoup the costs of future farm problems,
the bill would require farmers to buy federal crop insurance for
1989 if their losses this year exceed 65 percent of their normal
crops.
   The bill also has provisions encouraging soil and water
conservation, and providing aid to farmers harmed by recent hail
storms and hurricanes.

   The stock market held at sharply lower levels
today after falling in reaction to news that the Federal Reserve
boosted its key bank lending rate.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 26.67 at
2,080.73 by midafternoon.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 14 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 266 issues up, 1,167
down and 465 unchanged.
   Big Board volume, augmented by dividend-related moves and
computer-triggered sell programs, came to 158.81 million shares as
of 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   The market slipped shortly after the opening when the Fed
announced it was hiking the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6
percent. The increase marks the first change in the rate since
Sept. 7 and puts the rate at its highest level in more than two
years.
   The Fed said its decision, which could be mimicked by other
interest rates like those on credit cards and mortgages, ``reflects
the intent ... to reduce inflationary pressure.''
   Analysts expected an initial selloff following the news but were
cautiously optimistic that the market could digest the increase in
a matter of days.
   Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia, said that there wasn't any panic selling going on,
although portfolios were being realigned and consolidated.
   A few investors took the opportunity to hunt for bargains and
even looked on the news as positive. ``The feeling is that the
sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patient will
recover,'' said Michael Metz, vice president and technical anlayst
at Oppenheimer & Co.
   With the dollar was up sharply on the announcement, analysts
predicted more foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominated
instruments like stocks and bonds.
   While analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the
money supply this week, few expected the change would come in the
discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the Fed can take.
Most thought the Fed would push up the federal funds rate, the
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   Metz said, however, that the action enhances the Fed's
credibility among those who thought the central bank would refrain
from making any decisive moves before November's presidential
election.
   Traders were keeping a sharp eye on the credit markets, where
the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was off about $7.50 per
$1,000 in face value.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Houston Industries fell
] to 31{ with more than 51 million shares changing hands as traders
moved to capture the company's dividend.
   Elsewhere, General Electric was down | at 41; IBM was off 1 at
122]; Ford Motor fell ~ to 52[, and American Express was down { at
27|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.75 to 150.77. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.99 301.24.

<HEAD>Federal Charges Brought Against Accused Teen-aged Hacker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors have accused a teen-ager who dropped
out of high school with using his home computer to steal more than
$1 million in software from AT&T and the government, and they plan
go after other violators.
   ``This is not malicious mischief,'' said U.S. Attorney Anton
Valukas in announcing the federal charges on Monday. ``It's a
felony.''
   Charges brought against Herbert Zinn Jr., 18, of Chicago, signal
the start of ``an aggressive position toward computer crimes,''
Valukas said.
   The government also accused the young man of advertising on a
computer bulletin board how to electronically break into AT&T's
computers. He was charged in a criminal information.
   Zinn is accused of committing the crimes when he was a juvenile,
and could be sent to prison until his 21st birthday in August 1991.
   He could not be reached Tuesday at his North Side residence,
where his telephone went unanswered.
   Federal agents raided his home last year and confiscated three
computers and software allegedly stolen during the electronic
break-ins, and Zinn has not pursued his computer techniques ``with
quite the same vim and vigor,'' he told the Chicago Sun-Times.
   He said he nonetheless hoped eventually to resume his schooling
and become an electonics engineer, the newspaper said. Zinn would
not discuss details of the case, it said.
   The federal charges arose after Zinn had been arrested several
times, including for allegedly breaking into the computers at the
Keller Graduate School of Management and at Commodity Perspective
Inc., both in Chicago.
   ``Before and after the computer break-ins (at Keller and
Commodity Perspective), Zinn was, by his own admission, breaking
into AT&T computers,'' Valukas said.
   Court documents indicate Zinn broke into an AT&T computer at the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Maintenance and Supply
Headquarters in Burlington, N.C., and an AT&T computer at Robins
Air Force Base, Ga.
   Software taken from NATO and the Air Force base were ``low level
in terms of sensitivity,'' Valukas said.
   Agents raided Zinn's home after an AT&T security officer tuned
into the so-called Phreak Class-2600 computer bulletin board and
spotted messages signed by ``Shadow Hawk,'' a code name the
goverment said the teen-ager used.
   In the messages, Shadow Hawk bragged that he had successfully
gained access to AT&T computer files. In another, similar message,
Shadow Hawk made the mistake of including his telephone number,
which was spotted by a security officer, the government said.
   The purpose of the Texas-based Phreak Class-2600 is ``to educate
computer enthusiasts ... to penetrate industrial and government
sector computer systems,'' said William J. Cook, an assistant U.S.
attorney.
   Zinn also tried to electonically break into computers at the
Washington Post's accounts payable department, a hospital in South
Bend, Ind.; and computers in Columbus, Ohio; Rye, N.Y. and Pipe
Creek, Texas, the government said.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart Earnings Soar 34 Percent; Limited Earnings Skid 46
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s said Tuesday its profits soared 34
percent in the second quarter, while Limited Inc., which remained
mired in the year-old apparel industry slump, said its earnings
dropped 46 percent.
   Wal-Mart has been one of the few standouts in the struggling
retail industry. The discount store chain said it earned $179.6
million, or 32 cents a share, in the quarter ended July 31, up from
$134.1 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The company's sales increased in the latest quarter to $4.85
billion from $3.73 billion.
   Retail sales have fallen off over the past year in part because
of women's disenchantment with fashions, but also because consumers
have been trying to pay down their installment debt levels.
   Industry analysts say Wal-Mart consistently outperforms other
retailers because of its competitive pricing. The company also has
an efficient cost structure, enabling it to turn a large profit.
   Limited said its second-quarter earnings totaled $30.7 million,
or 17 cents a share, down from $57.2 million, or 30 cents a share,
in the same 1987 period.
   The apparel retailer's sales reached $893.1 million during the
quarter, up from $822.1 million.
   Limited Chairman Leslie H. Wexner said the company anticipated
relatively poor results and had kept its inventories at 1987 levels
and controlled the markdowns that have eroded apparel retailers'
earnings for a year.
   Industry analysts believe the retailers will see signs of a
recovery in the third quarter.
   Limited operates 3,252 specialty apparel stores under the names
Limited, Express, Henri Bendel, Victoria's Secret, Lerner, Lane
Bryant, Lerner Woman and Abercrombie & Fitch. It distributes
apparel nationally through the Brylane and Victoria's Secret
catalogue divisions.
   During the first half, Wal-Mart said it earned $333.2 million,
or 59 cents per share, up from $244.5 million, or 43 cents a share,
for the first six months of 1987.
   First-half sales totaled $9.13 billion, up from $6.94 billion a
year earlier.
   Limited said its earnings fell 47 percent during the first six
months to $54.6 million, or 30 cents a share, from $102.6 million,
or 54 cents a share, in the first half of last year.
   Sales rose to $1.7 billion from $1.63 billion.

<HEAD>Judge Freezes Assets In Stock Trading Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday authorized an
order to freeze the assets of six men charged with racketeering in
an alleged phony stock trading scheme.
   In rejecting the defendants' request for a stay, Judge Ralph K.
Winter of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals left intact a
federal district judge's freeze order. Winter set an Aug. 17 date
for a three-judge panel in New York to hear an appeal.
   The 2nd Circuit, which covers the states of New York,
Connecticut and Vermont and usually sits in New York City, is in
recess. Winter agreed to hear arguments in New Haven, where he
maintains his office.
   Five of the defendants in the racketeering case are top officers
of Princeton-Newport, an investment partnership based in Princeton,
N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif. The sixth is a former bond trader
for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street investment firm.
   Last Friday, U.S. District Judge Louis J. Stanton in Manhattan
issued a restraining order freezing some of the defendants' assets,
which would be subject to forfeiture if they are convicted of
racketeering.
   The district judge had barred the government from distributing
copies of his freeze order pending a hearing on the appeal.
   But under Winter's ruling, the government was permitted to
distribute copies to almost two dozen financial institutions,
partnerships and corporations, including Goldman Sachs & Co.;
United Jersey Bank; Kidder Peabody & Co.; Bear Stearns & Co.; and
Morgan Stanley & Co.
   Federal prosecutors had sought a much broader release of the
order.
   ``We wanted it to be distributed to everybody,'' said Bruce A.
Baird, an assistant U.S. attorney.
   The assets ordered frozen include those owned by the defendants.
The order prohibits Princeton-Newport, which was not named as a
defendant, from diluting any of its assets but does not bar any
transactions that are considered part of the normal course of
business.
   More than $200 million is invested with the partnership and its
subsidiaries by limited partners not named in the case.
   Lawyers for those entities not named as defendants argued the
freeze order was too broad and that the district court went beyond
its authority in freezing the assets of entities not named as
defendants.
   The six were named last Thursday in a 35-count indictment on
charges of racketeering and conspiracy, the first time a
racketeering charge has been leveled against securities traders.
   The defendants from Princeton-Newport are James Sutton Regan,
Jack Z. Rabinowitz, Charles M. Zarzecki, Paul Berkman and Steven
Barry Smotrich. Also named was Bruce Lee Newberg, a former
securities trader at Drexel.
   The indictment accuses the six of a multimillion-dollar mail and
wire fraud conspiracy to make false stock trades in order to create
phony long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses for
Princeton-Newport.
   The indictment charged there was a scheme involving the bogus
sale of securities between Princeton-Newport and Drexel to create
more than $13 million in phony tax losses and avoid regulatory
disclosure requirements.

<TEXT>
   A baldness remedy developed by the
Upjohn Co. is one step closer to final federal approval, company
officials said Tuesday.
   The Kalamazoo-based pharmaceutical company said it received an
``approvable letter'' from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for its topical minoxidil preparation for the treatment of male
pattern baldness, developed under the trade name Rogaine.
   An approvable letter is ``historically the last step before
final approval'' for marketing, said company spokesman R.D. LaRue.
LaRue said the letter means the scientific data submitted by the
company have been approved, leaving only label language to be
worked out.
   LaRue would not speculate when final approval may be granted.
   After a brief halt in dealing on the New York Stock Exchange,
Upjohn was up about 75 cents at $32.25 a share in active afternoon
trading.
   The drug already is approved for use in several other countries,
including Canada.
   Minoxidil was developed as a blood pressure treatment, but the
company noted about 10 years ago that some of its users experienced
increased hair growth.

   Share prices fell sharply Tuesday on the London
Stock Exchange after the U.S. Federal Reserve Board unexpectedly
increased its discount rate by a half percentage point to 6.5
percent.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 13.4
points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,862.6.
   Sharply declining prices on Wall Street pulled London equities
lower, dealers said. The Dow Jones industrial average was off 31.12
points at 2,076.12 as the London session drew to a close.
   ``We're entirely geared to Wall Street at this point,'' one
equity analyst said.
   Volume was a moderate 424.9 million shares, compared with
Monday's 369.2 million shares.
   Dealers said London stock prices were still reeling from
Monday's unexpected half-point rise in the British commercial
banks' base lending rate to 11 percent.
   Some dealers said the increase in the U.S. discount rate, on the
heels of Monday's British rate rise, sparked fears of another round
of global interest rate hikes.
   The move by the U.S. central bank ``has reinforced the message
that the Fed is more concerned about the pace of U.S. economic
expansion than they had given voice to previously,'' said Charles
Larkum, a British equity market analyst at the London investment
firm James Capel and Co.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 13.6 points to 1,501.1.
But the Financial Times 500-share index rose 7.79 points to close
at 1,062.61.

   The stock market sunk deeper into negative

   Wheat, corn and soybean futures closed modestly
higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade with prospects for
rain offsetting a private report indicating severe drought damage
to corn and soybean crops.
   Oat futures closed lower.
   The widely-followed crop analyst Conrad Leslie of Chicago
estimated 1988 U.S. soybean production at 1.48 billion bushels,
down 23 percent from last year's actual production of 1.91 billion
bushels. Leslie estimated corn production at 4.28 billion bushels,
a 39 percent drop from the 7.06 billion bushels harvested last year.
   Leslie's numbers fell near the low end of other private
estimates issued in advance of the Agriculture Department's
official report on Thursday. In its July crop report, the USDA
pegged 1988 soybean production at 1.65 billion bushels and corn
production at 5.2 billion bushels.
   The USDA's weekly crop update, showing a decline in crop
conditions last week, provided further support to the grain
futures, said Mario Balletto, soybean analyst with Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York.
   But forecasts for a second night of rain in the central Midwest
kept the rally in check, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.81 a bushel; corn was }
cent to 3{ cents higher with September at $2.97{ a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 5 cents lower with September at $2.69 a bushel; and
soybeans were 6{ cents to 13 cents higher with August at $8.53 a
bushel.

<TEXT>
   Ailing Maxicare Health Plans Inc. has
replaced its husband-and-wife team of top managers, naming a film
industry accountant as chairman of the nation's largest health
maintenance organization.
   Maxicare said Monday it had appointed Peter J. Ratican, 44, an
outside director, as chairman, president and chief executive.
Ratican previously was chief financial officer and board member at
DeLaurentiis Film Group, which is restructuring in an attempt to
solve its own financial problems.
   Ratican succeeds Fred W. Wasserman, chairman and chief
executive, and Wasserman's wife, Pamela K. Anderson, who was
president. Wasserman, 50, who helped found the company in 1973, and
Ms. Anderson, 41, will stay on as consultants for one year, the
company said, without giving a reason for the change.
   The changes won't affect the plan's 2 million members in 19
states and there aren't any layoffs planned, said spokeswoman Tobi
Nyberg.
   Maxicare, which has sold some assets in a restructuring effort,
also said it expected to post a $50 million loss in the second
quarter.
   The company, troubled by debt incurred in an ambitious expansion
plan, stiff competition in the industry and rising medical costs,
has reported losses in the last six quarters. In the first quarter
of this year, the company lost $21.3 million on revenue of $485.9
million.

   Westinghouse Credit Corp., a subsidiary of
Westinghouse Electric Corp., said Tuesday it has agreed to sell its
Fixed-Asset Lending Division to ``a major U.S. corporation'' it did
not identify.
   Westinghouse said the proposed sale would transfer all the
division's financing receivables and other assets, and about 175
employees in 10 cities. It said its receivables were worth about
$650 million on June 30.
   The terms of the sale were not disclosed.
   Westinghouse said the division ``specializes in secured
financing of income-producing capital equipment and facilities for
middle-market customers'' in the United States, including
construction equipment, machine tools, transportation equipment and
computers.
   It said it also provides financing to major fast-food
franchises, convenience store chains and for used cars.
   Westinghouse said its loans average about $150,000 and mature in
an average of four years.
   It said its division offices are in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Dallas,
Denver, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Seattle, San Francisco
and Mount Laurel, N.J.

<HEAD>Kuwait Pledges to Limit Stake in BP to 21.68 Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: rewrites throughout with trade office refusing documents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kuwait Investment Office, the investment arm
of the Kuwaiti government, said Tuesday it signed legal documents
pledging to limit its stake in British Petroleum Co. PLC to its
current 21.68-percent level.
   However, Trade Secretary Lord Young refused to accept the
documents, and returned them on grounds they would be prejudicial
in a review of the stake by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,
the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   The commission, which currently is reviewing the Kuwaiti holding
in BP, is expected to decide by Sept. 2 whether the stake is
anti-competitive or against the national interest.
   Young is to decide what action to take in light of the
commission's findings.
   The London-based Kuwaiti office said it also pledged not to
exercise voting rights representing more than 14.9 percent of the
oil giant's shares.
   The office also promised not to use its stake ``to further any
other commercial or political interest of Kuwait.''
   In addition, the office agreed not to seek representation on
BP's board of directors, and not to oppose the election of any BP
board members proposed by the board.
   The Kuwaiti office's law firm, Stephenson Harwood, said the
pledges were designed to make legally binding the assurances which
the office already has given to the British government about its BP
stake.
   ``In order to put beyond doubt that it regards itself as bound
by the assurances already given, the state of Kuwait has entered
into binding covenants, intended to be enforceable by the British
government in the British courts, which confirm that its interest
in BP is that of an investor only,'' Stephenson Harwood said.
   The Kuwaiti office stressed the legal documents were signed
``entirely on its own initiative'' and not under pressure from the
British government or commission.
   The office began aquiring the stake in British Petroleum
piecemeal after the government sold off its remaining 31.5 percent
stake in the oil company last fall. The 7.5 billion-pound, or $13
billion, share sale coincided with the stock market crash, which
depressed the market price of the oil company's stock.

   Investors dumped stocks and bonds Tuesday but
the dollar rallied smartly against major foreign currencies after
the Federal Reserve boosted its key bank lending rate a half
percentage point for the first time since Black Monday.
   The increase in the discount rate, to 6.5 percent from 6
percent, was made ``to reduce inflationary pressures (and) ... in
light of the growing spread of market interest rates over the
discount rate,'' according to the Fed.
   Many economists predicted other interest rates, including those
on mortgages or home-equity loans, would rise as a result of the
Fed's credit tightening. And a few market watchers worried about
the near-term effects on the already skittish stock market.
   The increase in the discount-rate _ the fee the central bank
charges member banks for loans _ was the second since Alan
Greenspan replaced Paul A. Volcker at the Fed's helm a year ago. On
Sept. 4, the central bank raised the rate for the first time in
three years, to 6 percent from 5.5 percent.
   While last September's increase in the rate also was taken in
response to inflationary fears, analysts later cited it as a
contributing factor to the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   ``I just hope history doesn't repeat itself,'' said Irwin
Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ``I
don't look for a market collapse but the cross-currents of the
stock market aren't very favorable. It certainly is dangerous.''
   On Wall Street, stock prices fell sharply in response to the
announcement, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losing
slightly more than 28 points to 2,079.13. It had been down nearly
40 points late in the day.
   Bond prices tumbled while interest rates rose. The Treasury's
bellwether 30-year issue was off about $10 per $1,000 face amount,
while its yield jumped to 9.19 percent from 9.10 percent late
Monday.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar advanced strongly against major
currencies. Higher interest rates make the dollar more valuable.
   The biggest increases came against the Japanese yen and West
German marks. By late afternoon Tuesday, the dollar had broken
through the psychologically important 135-yen level from Monday's
New York close of 133.97, and to 1.92 marks from 1.90.
   Analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the money
supply this week, but few were expecting an increase in the
discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the Fed can take.
   Tuesday's increase brings the discount rate to its steepest
level since April 1986, when it fell to 6.5 percent from 7 percent.
   ``The (credit) markets have been screaming for a discount rate
increase for quite some time; the surprise was in the timing of
it,'' said Kellner.
   ``Not only is the Republican convention coming up, but we're in
the middle of a Treasury refunding,'' in which the government is
auctioning off $22 billion in new three- and 10-year notes this
week to pay off its old debts.
   ``I don't think inflation is any worse today than it was last
year,'' said Kellner.
   But Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc., defended the discount rate hike.
   ``The economy has been doing well but inflation has ben creeping
up,'' he said. ``It's the Fed's job to throw cold water on the
economy when it starts overheating and that's what it appears to be
doing right now.''
   Among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the July
unemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows.
   Concerns about inflation have pushed interest rates higher in
recent months. The federal funds rate, which is the interest on
overnight loans between banks, has been on the rise. Elizabeth G.
Reiners, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the yield
spread between the fed funds rate and discount rate had been at its
highest level in about a year.
   A month ago, major banks boosted their prime lending rates, a
half percentage point to 9.5 percent from 9 percent.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we had another prime rate hike by
Friday,'' said David Resler, chief economist Nomura Securities Inc.

<HEAD>ICC OKs Rio Grande Purchase of Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rio Grande Industries Inc. received government
approval Tuesday for its $1.2 billion purchase of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, one of the nation's oldest rail lines with track
stretching from Oregon to Louisiana.
   Southern Pacific, which has 15,000 miles of track, will retain
its name and incorporate into its operations the smaller Denver &
Rio Grande Western Railroad once the purchase is completed, company
officials said.
   By a 4-0 vote, the Interstate Commerce Commission gave approval
for the railroad's sale by its parent Sante Fe Southern Pacific
Corp., to Rio Grande Industries, a subsidiary of the Denver-based
Anschutz Corp.
   Philip Anschutz, owner of the privately held company, told
reporters he intends to concentrate on reducing Southern Pacific's
debts, partly through the sale of some of its real estate holdings,
and modernize the railroad's equipment and facilities.
   ``We will be in the railroad business, first and foremost,''
said Anschutz, whose background is in energy.
   Anschutz, who has a reputation of being reclusive, acknowledged
that he had never before held a news conference, but he said he
wanted to meet with reporters to set to rest unfounded ``rumors,''
including one that sought the Southern Pacific to break it up and
make a quick profit.
   ``It's very important that this company be kept together,'' he
said.
   The Anschutz Corp. purchased Rio Grande Industries four years
ago.
   William Holtman, chairman of Rio Grande Industries, expressed
confidence in Anschutz's devotion to railroading. ``He's a
long-term player,'' Holtman said of Anschutz.
   The ICC said the merger of the Southern Pacific and the Denver &
Rio Grande Western railroads would have the best competitive
benefits and be in the public interest. The merger was recommended
by both the Justice Department and the Transportation Department.
   The commission last year ordered the Chicago-based Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp. to divest itself of either the Southern
Pacific or the Santa Fe railroads after it rejected a proposal to
merge the two rail lines. The company chose to sell the Southern
Pacific.
   Southern Pacific's stock has been held in a trust for nearly
five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should own
the railroad.
   ``We look forward to completing the sale, getting out of
trusteeship and moving forward again with a clear idea of Southern
Pacific's future course and direction,'' said Denman McNear,
chairman of the Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
   Anschutz said the Southern Pacific's management team would be
chosen from among the senior managers of both the Southern Pacific
and the Denver & Rio Grande Western.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries
on the sale last February, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the ICC, another railroad company, Kansas City
Southern Industries, objected and asked that it be allowed to buy
the railroad.
   But the ICC in a series of votes Tuesday turned its back on the
Kansas City Southern proposal. One concern of the ICC was Kansas
City Southern's financial outlook in light of a $600 million court
judgment that is under appeal.
   The judgment stems from antitrust and contract violations
involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in South Dakota. Kansas
City Southern had argued that the judgment would not affect its
ability to finance the Southern Pacific purchase.
   Kansas City Southern could challenge the ICC ruling in court,
but the company's president and chief executive officer, Landon
Rowland, said no decision has been made on what the next step, if
any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' Rowland told reporters after
the ICC vote.
   The Southern Pacific, which is rich in history, operates up and
down the West Coast and along the southern tier of the country with
tracks stretching from Portland, Ore., through central California
and across the Southwest as far east as New Orleans. It also
operates lines from San Francisco to Ogden, Utah, where it links up
with the Denver & Rio Grande Western, and from St. Louis to the
Gulf Coast.
   The Denver & Rio Grande runs along a central corridor from Ogden
to St. Louis.
   Both railroads have been closely intertwined with the history of
the West, helping to bring in settlers, miners and industry.
   Southern Pacific's founders helped drive the golden spike in
Utah in 1869, linking the country's first transcontinental rail
line. Two years later, the Denver & Rio Grande ran its first train
from Denver to Colorado Springs.
   Anschutz said the new railroad ``will operate under the banner
of Southern Pacific,'' although within the company the Denver & Rio
Grande Western will continue to maintain its own identity.
   He said he decided to retain the Southern Pacific name because
it is by far the larger of the two railroads and probably better
known. ``Last of all, I like the name,'' he added.

   The stock market fell deep into negative
territory today in reaction to news that the Federal Reserve
boosted its key bank lending rate, but equities managed to finish
off their worst levels.
   The Fed announced shortly after the opening bell that it was
hiking the discount rate a half a percentage point to 6.5 percent,
its highest level in more than two years. Stock prices immediately
headed south.
   An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the Fed
charges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank's
most direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on
economic growth. Jumps in other interest rates, including those on
mortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow.
   Analysts were cautiously optimistic that the market, which had
been anticipating higher interest rates, could digest the hike in
the coming days. They reasoned that with the dollar up sharply on
the announcement, foreign funds will shift into dollar-denominated
instruments like stocks and bonds.
   Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in
Philadelphia, noted that volume, minus dividend-capturing
strategies, was moderate and that there was no sign of any panic
selling.
   A few investors took the opportunity to hunt for bargains and
even considered the news somewhat positive. ``The feeling is that
the sooner the medicine is administered, the quicker the patient
will recover,'' said Michael Metz, vice president and technical
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   He also said the action enhances the Fed's credibility among
those who thought the central bank would refrain from making any
decisive moves before November's presidential election.

<HEAD>Stockholder Sues Gillette Over Coniston Proxy Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Gillette Co. stockholder filed suit in
federal court Tuesday claiming thousands of shareholders lost money
because they sold stock after Gillette used a misleading
advertisement in a proxy fight against a New York investment firm.
   The class action suit is the latest chapter in a seven-month
saga involving Coniston Group's failed efforts to gain control of
the personal care giant that appeared over when the parties settled
out of court last week.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of former
Gillette shareholder Harold Brown, claims Coniston's slate of
candidates to the Gillette board was defeated in the April 21 proxy
vote because of a Gillette advertisement questioning the investment
firm's makeup.
   ``The defendants intended to and did create a false and
misleading impression that Coniston's slate of candidates should
not be elected ... and would not be able to sell Gillette at a
premium over market prices, which misstatements deflated the market
prices of Gillette common stock,'' the suit states.
   Coniston, which had acquired 5.8 percent of Gillette's 112
million outstanding shares, had sought to gain a third of
Gillette's 12-member board and then sell the razor blade maker to
the highest bidder.
   The suit claims ``at least several thousand persons'' took a
loss when they dumped Gillette shares after the company won the
proxy battle. It seeks unspecified compensation for the losses.
   Gillette stock, which had been trading around $40 a share before
the vote, dipped to a low of about $36 in the days after Gillette
announced a narrow victory on May 3, analysts said.
   But the stock climbed back to over $40 after U.S. District Judge
Mark L. Wolf ruled July 7 that the ad was misleading and later said
he was inclined to order a new election. The stock nosedived again
immediately after the two sides on Aug. 1 announced a settlement in
which Gillette agreed to buy back an estimated 16 million shares
from Coniston at $45 each, or about $720 million.
   Gillette stock fell 37{ cents a share to $35 in composite
trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The lawsuit claims that in the three days after the ad was
published, Gillette received 642,000 proxies revoking prior ballots
submitted for Coniston. The difference would have closed a 52
percent to 48 percent gap but not reversed the outcome.
   The suit represents people who lost money selling Gillette stock
between April 19, the date of the advertisements, and July 6, when
Wolf ruled that the ads contained ``false and misleading''
information about Coniston.
   The ads, which appeared in The New York Times and The Wall
Street Journal, said Coniston was controlled by a ``complicated
web'' of foreign and domestic firms involved in its effort to
control Gillette.
   ``As a result of that, the proposal was defeated and the stock
dropped,'' said David Berger, a prominent Philadelphia securities
lawyer who is representing Brown, an attorney with an office in
Boston. ``In order to minimize the damage, my client sold out.
   ``(Stockholders') expectations were Coniston's proposal would be
have been approved by the shareholders and the stock would have
gone up.''
   Berger said Brown sold all of his more than 20,000 shares of
Gillette stock after the company withstood the Coniston bid.
   Gillette spokesman David Fausch said about the suit: ``We're not
surprised. This is a litigious world.''
   Analysts said they did not expect the latest legal challenge to
Gillette to affect the company.
   ``I think it's without merit,'' said Harry E. Wells III of Adams
Harkness. ``Stocks move around and elections are won and lost. If
you're going to play the game you've got to be a big boy.''
   Gillette filed suit on April 14 claiming Coniston falsified SEC
filings and failed to fully disclose its investors. Coniston's
countersuit, filed five days later, charged Gillette with
misrepresentation in the advertisements.
   Coniston's suit was heard first in a non-jury trial. Gillette's
case against Coniston was in pre-trial stages when the sides
settled.

   Steve Van Gorder and Rick Fahs see the
future of the American fishing industry in farmers' barns and
abandoned inner-city buildings.
   Van Gorder and Fahs, co-founders of Fresh-Culture Systems Inc.,
say they've developed a way to raise 40,000 pounds of fish a year
in tanks fitting in 5,000 square feet of space.
   ``I think people will pay more for a top-quality product they
feel safe with,'' Van Gorder said. Reports of medical waste and
other pollution in the nation's waters has spurred increasing
worries among consumer about the fish they buy, he added.
   The Fresh-Culture system, which sells for about $125,000, is the
first to reduce energy costs enough to economically raise
fresh-water fish indoors in the Northeast and Midwest, Van Gorder
and Fahs claim.
   Striped bass, salmon and other fish grown in the system's 15
cylindrical tanks can be sold to restaurants and fish markets to
meet the growing demand for fish, they say.
   Increasingly health conscious Americans have been eating more
fish in recent years. Consumption per capita has grown from 12.3
pounds in 1982 to 15.4 pounds last year, according to the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
   Christian Herr, a program administrator with the state Bureau of
Agricultural Development, said the technology used in the
Fresh-Culture system is new.
   ``We definitely see that it will be able to be used by our
Pennsylvania farmers that want to diversify,'' Herr said.
   Fahs, a 35-year-old former plant manager with General Mills
Inc., said fish farming also could bring industry back to inner
cities.
   ``You can put this in a burned out building they're selling for
a dollar,'' he said.
   Fish farming itself is not new.
   Catfish have been raised in outdoor ponds for about 20 years.
Trout also is ``farmed'' outdoors in Idaho and elsewhere; and
striped bass is raised in tanks in California and elsewhere.
   Unlike these systems, Fresh-Culture recirculates almost all the
water in the tanks, said Van Gorder, 36, who has been researching
aquaculture for 10 years.
   It also costs little to heat, one of the main stumbling blocks
of previous systems with recirculating water, he said.
   In a small building in Kutztown, a rural eastern Pennsylvania
town, Fahs and Van Gorder are raising striped bass, trout and
tilapia in one of their systems. They say they hope to begin
selling their fish to restaurants in January.
   A 2{ horsepower motor pumps air to the 2,000-gallon tanks and
pushes the water filters for them, while a computer monitors water
temperature and heats the tanks overnight, when energy costs are
lower, Van Gorder said.
   During a power outage, a backup gas-powered air pump is
activated, he added.
   Trout and salmon require temperatures from 60 to 70 degrees,
while striped bass and tilapia need 80-degree water, according to
Van Gorder.
   Fahs said fish can be produced in six months for about $2.50 a
pound after start-up costs, with proper management, and sold for $5
or more to restaurants in the New York City and elsewhere in the
Northeast.
   Aquatic Systems Inc., a San Diego-based company, expects to
harvest 650,000 pounds of striped bass this year from a fish farm
in Mecca, Calif., near Palm Springs, said Timothy Hovanec, an
assistant production manager.
   Unlike Fresh-Culture's system, Aquatic Systems has geothermally
heated tanks and only recirculates some of the water, Hovanec said.
   ``I may be unnecessarily skeptical, but there are at least 20 or
30 people trying to get into striped bass,'' he said.
   Van Gorder and Fahs say they expect the skepticism.
   ``There are a lot of systems on paper,'' Fahs acknowledges.
   But they say they are confident their approach will attract
customers.
   ``It's the freshest, non-polluted source of fish you can get,''
Van Gorder said.

<HEAD>Chevron Corp. To Expand Capacity For Polymer Grade Propylene
Manufacture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp., a leading marketer of
polymer grade propylene, announced plans Tuesday to expand capacity
for the manufacture of the chemical at two Texas facilities.
   Chevron plans to expand capacity for the manufacture of polymer
grade propylene at its Port Arthur refinery and Cedar Bayou olefins
plant in Texas, the company said in a statement.
   Polymer grade propylene is a high purity building block chemical
used to make other materials such as polypropylene, which is
extensively used in plastic automobile parts, toys, medical
products and appliances.
   ``Chevron remains strongly committed to the polymer grade
propylene business,'' said George Scott, vice president of Chevron
Chemical Co. and general manager of the Olefins & Derivatives
Division.
   ``The domestic and international propylene consuming businesses
have been expanding rapidly in the past two years, especially
polypropylene. This expansion assures that we will be able to keep
pace with that growth,'' said Scott.
   The expansions, to be constructed in two stages, will add about
350 million pounds to the company's annual capacity to produce
polymer grade propylene. The total capacity will be 1.3 billion
pounds per year.
   The first stage is scheduled to begin in October and will boost
capacity at subsidiary Chevron Chemical Co.'s Olefins & Derivatives
Division plant at Cedar Bayou by about 20 percent to 800 million
pounds by adding propylene splitting towers to its ethylene unit.
   The second stage, anticipated to begin during the fourth quarter
of 1989, will boost capacity at subsidiary Chevron U.S.A.'s Port
Arthur refinery by more than 180 million pounds per year by adding
a new propylene upgrading unit.
   The company said expansion at the two facilities will be
complemented by installation of a new olefin splitter and export
facility at Chevron U.S.A.'s Pascagoula, Miss., refinery, designed
to separate and transport dilute propylene to Texas for further
upgrading.
   In addition, the Galena Park terminal of Chevron subsidiary
Warren Petroleum Co., situated on the Houston Ship Channel, will be
modified to receive and transport this material to Port Arthur and
Cedar Bayou.

   A Federal Maritime Commission finding that
industry rules for containerized ships unfairly discriminate
against small cargo shippers was upheld Tuesday by a federal
appeals court.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here said the maritime
commission correctly ignored the rules' effect on labor-management
relations when it found they improperly forced small shippers to
employ unionized dock workers to handle their cargo.
   ``It is not the national labor policy to allow otherwise
unlawful activity merely because an employer and a union have
agreed to it in mandatory collective bargaining,'' a three-judge
panel of the court said in a unanimous ruling.
   At issue are rules first negotiated in 1968 by the International
Longshoremen's Association and the shipping industry that require
unionized dockhands to load or unload cargo containers that pass
through East Coast ports.
   The rules exempt manufacturers and large shippers that load
cargo into containers at their own warehouses.
   But small shippers, whose cargo would not fill a single
container, are forced to lease containers from the shipping
companies and deliver their goods for loading at a unionized pier.
   The regulations were negotiated as part of the industry's
efforts to introduce cargo containers, which can be unloaded from a
ship into a railroad car or a flat-bed truck without being opened
by dock hands.
   The widespread use of containers has greatly reduced the number
of longshoremen needed to unload ships and the rules were
implemented to help the ILA cut the losses to its workforce.
   Last year, the maritime commission unanimously struck down the
regulations, which were challenged by freight forwarders, trucking
companies and handlers of small amounts of cargo.
   The commission's finding, however, was stayed while the ILA and
the shipping industry appealed the decision.
   John Hammon, executive vice president of the National Customs
Brokers and Forwarders Association of America Inc., hailed the
court's decision, saying the rules amount to ``flagrant
featherbeading... that was just very damaging to import-export
commerce.''
   There was on immediate comment from the ILA, which is expected
to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
   The ruling could also become a bargaining chip in contract
negotiations between the ILA and the shipping industry.
   The regulations require that merchandise placed on containers
within 50 miles of a port by non-ILA workers had to be unloaded on
the dock and placed into different containers before it was loaded
on ships.
   The rules mean ``extra costs in delays and exposure to
pilferage,'' Hammon said. Small cargo shippers have begun using
Canadian ports to avoid the restrictions, resulting in less
business for East Coast ports, he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges On U.S. Discount Rate Rise; Gold Slides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar advanced strongly on domestic and
foreign markets Tuesday after the Federal Reserve surprised traders
by increasing its discount rate.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $426.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $430.20
late Monday.
   ``Raising rates in the face of a strong dollar probably was not
expected,'' said Rick Gomes, a vice president at Irving Trust Co.
   Traders had not expected the Fed to increase the discount rate,
the fee the central bank charges for short-term loans to member
banks, because the dollar has been strong, Gomes said.
   Investors bought the dollar because higher interest rates make
it more valuable.
   Gomes said it was possible the major industrial countries known
as the Group of Seven _ the United States is one _ were putting
their monetary policies ahead of their currencies. Gomes said there
were rumors in the market that West Germany, Japan and other G-7
countries might follow the Fed's lead and increase their own
interest rates.
   But Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust & Co. in
Chicago, said foreign interest rate hikes would not stop the
dollar's upswing.
   ``The only thing to put a cap on the dollar would be central
bank selling,'' he said.
   Johnson called the Fed move confirmation of the economy's
strength.
   The Fed's board voted unanimously to increase the disount rate
to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. The increase, which took effect
immediately, was the first change in the rate since Sept. 4 and put
the rate at its highest in more than two years.
   An increase in the discount rate is the central bank's most
direct way of pushing interest rates higher as a curb on economic
growth. Economists have been concerned in recent months that
continuing economic growth could spark a new round of inflation,
partly because of the country's low unemployment, high production
levels and the Midwestern drought.
   In Tokyo, before the Fed announcement, the dollar fell 0.39
Japanese yen to a closing 133.58 yen. In late London trading, after
news of the discount rate hike, the dollar rose to 134.25 yen and
in New York, it climbed to 135.15 yen from 133.725 yen late Monday.
   In London, the British pound fell sharply against the dollar. It
cost $1.6830 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7022 late Monday.
Sterling also dropped against the dollar in New York, closing at
$1.6840, compared with late Monday's $1.7005.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.9204 West German marks, up from 1.90005; 1.6065
Swiss francs, up from 1.5883; 6.4710 French francs, up from 6.4115;
1,413.475 Italian lire, up from 1,402.00; and 1.2160 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2110.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.5960 Swiss francs, up from 1.5857; 6.4325 French
francs, up from 6.3950; 2.1570 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1435;
1,403.50 Italian lire, up from 1,399.50; and 1.2137 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2097.
   Gold prices fell under increased selling pressure after the
discount rate rise attracted investors away from bullion.
   In London, gold dropped to a late bid of $426 a troy ounce,
compared with $432.25 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold closed at a
bid $426 an ounce compared with $432 bid late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.39 to close at a bid $430.61
an ounce.
   In New York, gold fell on the Commodity Exchange to $427.40 a
troy ounce, down from $430.40 late Monday.
   Silver slipped in London to a late bid of $6.60 a troy ounce,
down from $6.78 late Monday. On New York's Comex, silver fell to
$6.630 a troy ounce from late Monday's $6.675.

   The stock market fell sharply Tuesday following
the Federal Reserve's surprise hike in its key bank lending rate,
which sparked fears that interest rates may be headed even higher.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been off
nearly 40 points, closed down 28.27 at 2,079.13, its fourth
consecutive losing session.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
348 issues up, 1,206 down and 418 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 200.71 million shares,
up from 148.80 million in the previous session but augmented by
dividend-related trading. Nationwide, consolidated volume in
NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on
the over-the-counter market, totaled 224.85 million shares.
   Stock prices opened slightly lower but headed further south
shortly after the opening when the Fed announced it was boosting
the discount rate a half a percentage point to 6.5 percent, its
highest level in more than two years.
   An increase in the discount rate, which is the fee the Fed
charges for short-term loans to member banks, is the central bank's
most direct way of pushing interest rates higher to curb economic
growth. Economists said jumps in other interest rates, including
those on mortgage rates and credit cards, are likely to follow.
   Some investors regarded the news on interest rates as positive,
reasoning that with the economy growing strongly and inflation
picking up, a dash of tighter credit could keep the economy from
overheating.
   ``The feeling is that the sooner the medicine is administered,
the quicker the patient will recover,'' said Michael Metz, vice
president and technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.
   With the dollar up sharply on the Fed's announcement, some
analysts said stocks and bonds could to be in line for a boost as
foreign funds shift into dollar-denominated insvestments.
   But others feared that much more will be needed to keep the
economy in line. Concern that the Fed ``is going to have to tighten
the screw another notch'' gave most investors the jitters, said
Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president at First Albany Corp.
   ``The market is still looking for direction and is locked in
gridlock between higher interest rates and strong economic
numbers,'' Johnson said, adding that what results is a trendless
trading pattern.
   While analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the
money supply this week, few expected the change would come in the
discount rate, which is the most dramatic move the Fed can take.
Most thought the Fed would push up the federal funds rate, the
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   But analysts applauded the Fed's ability to crack down on
inflation this close to a presidential election, saying the move
enhances the central bank's credibility. ``And ultimately, the
financial markets will benefit if the Fed is credible,'' Johnson
said.
   Money center banks fell in response to the discount rate news,
which will increase their borrowing costs. Among them, Citicorp
fell { to 24|; Chase Manhattan was off ] at 29~; Manufacturers
Hanover was down | at 29{, and J.P. Morgan fell 1 to 36{.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Houston Industries fell
\ to 31} with more than 51 million shares changing hands as traders
moved to capture the company's dividend.
   Upjohn jumped 1} to 33\. The company said it received an
``approvable'' letter from the Food and Drug Administration for its
Rogaine treatment for male baldness.
   Elsewhere, IBM fell 1{ to 121|; Ford Motor fell 1[ to 51~, and
USX was off ~ at 29].
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $31.76 billion, or 1.18
percent, in value.
   The NYSE index was down 1.86 at 150.66.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials fell 4.07 to 306.86,
and S&P's 500-stock composite index was off 3.49 at 266.49.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index fell 3.11
to 301.12. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market closed at 384.23, off 3.43.

<DATELINE>EVENDALE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. announced Tuesday it
is supplying $55 million worth of jet engines to power three
aircraft for Interflug, East Germany's state-owned airline.
   General Electric officials said Interflug chose the GE-built
CF6-80C2 turbofan engine to power three Airbus Industrie A310-300
jetliners. Delivery of the twin-engine A310s is scheduled to begin
in the first quarter of 1989.
   ``Interflug will be the first Eastern bloc (airline) to operate
GE engines. The U.S. government, by granting the export license for
this sale, has opened the door for additional sales to Eastern
Europe,'' said Lee Kapor, vice president and general manager of
commercial engine operations at GE's Aircraft Engine Business Group
headquarters in Evendale, a Cincinnati suburb.
   In order to comply with U.S. export license requirements, the
West German commercial airline Lufthansa has agreed to perform all
aircraft and engine maintenance in Hamburg, West Germany, GE
officials said.
   Total sales of the CF6-80C2 jet engines stand at $6 billion.
General Electric said it has orders from 40 customers to supply
engines for 303 aircraft.

<TEXT>
   A young lawyer at the center of an insider
trading ring known as the ``Yuppie Five'' was sentenced Tuesday to
four months in prison _ nearly two years after he admitted his
guilt.
   Michael David pleaded guilty in November 1986 to four criminal
counts for his part in an insider trading scheme with three other
Wall Street professionals and an investor.
   The five, who have all pleaded guilty to various charges, were
all in their 20s at the time of the indictment and were dubbed the
``Yuppie Five.''
   The case had nothing to do with insider trading cases involving
Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, said officials.
   David, 30, of Manhattan, the last to plead guilty after his
pre-trial motions were denied by U.S. District Judge John Keenan in
late 1986, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud and obstruction of a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation.
   ``You completely disrupt the forces of the free market and help
to create incredible cynicism among the general populace,'' Keenan
lectured David, adding: ``People think that no one is straight.''
   Defense lawyer Darrell Fennell, in asking for leniency, noted
that David, once an associate at the the prominent New York law
firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, faces
disbarment and has been driving a cab to support himself.
   Visibly irritated, Keenan countered: ``I don't think anyone
should confuse the practice of law with a right _ it's a
privilege!''
   ``I regret my conduct,'' David, dressed in a dark gray suit,
told Keenan before sentence was imposed and asked the judge for an
opportunity ``to help rebuild my life as I have tried to do.''
   ``If I just say `Go and sin no more,''' said Keenan, slapping
his own wrist, ``I'm making a mockery of the process.''
   Keenan added: ``You did betray a trust.''
   He sentenced David to four months in prison and four years
probation. Keenan did not impose a fine but David faces civil
penalties of between $50,000 and $150,000 under an SEC consent
agreement.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Lowenson Jr., noted that David
had cooperated extensively for almost two years with federal
investigators and if there were any future trials arrising from the
probe ``Mr. David would be an important government witness.''
   Keenan said he would have sentenced David to more jail time if
not for his cooperation.
   David received the longest jail term of the ``Yuppie Five.''
Former stock broker Morton Shapiro was sentenced to two months in
prison but the other three did not receive jail terms.

   Prospects of a second night of rain in the central Corn Belt
limited rallies in corn and soybean futures prices Tuesday, despite
an influential private report indicating severe drought damage to
the crops.
   Wheat futures also gained slightly on the Chicago Board of Trade
while oat futures closed lower.
   On other markets, coffee futures rose sharply, precious metals
declined; livestock and meat were mixed; energy futures were lower;
and stock-index futures retreated.
   A report from the respected Chicago-based crop analyst Conrad
Leslie generated buying interest in crop futures.
   Leslie estimated 1988 U.S. soybean production at 1.48 billion
bushels, down 23 percent from last year's actual production of 1.91
billion bushels, and corn production at 4.28 billion bushels, a 39
percent drop from the 7.06 billion bushels harvested last year.
   ``This means the worst drought of the century is producing the
smallest U.S. corn crop since 1970,'' Leslie said in his report.
   Leslie also reported signs of spider mite damage to soybean
plants in Illinois and Iowa. Even if such plants received rain, he
said, ``they may only stabili the contract for
delivery in September at $3.79\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 4\
cents higher with September at $2.99 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to
5{ cents lower with September at $2.68 a bushel; and soybeans were
3{ cents to 20 cents higher with August at $8.55} a bushel.
   Coffee futures prices surged in light trading on New York's
Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange but analysts said the rally was
technical in nature and not related to any new developments within
the International Coffee Organization.
   Light buying by coffee roasters nudged prices past a key
technical point, which triggered a broader rally, said Sandra Kaul,
coffee analyst in New York with Shearson, Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Coffee for September delivery settled 3.81 cents higher at
$1.1834 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange after the Federal Reserve Board announced it was boosting
the discount rate from 6 percent to 6.5 percent.
   But Richard Levine, vice president of the precious metals and
foreign exchange group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said the
sell-off was precipitated by weak technical factors, not by
prospects of lower inflation.
   ``Short-term technicals were bearish before the Fed had anything
to say,'' he said.
   Gold settled $2.80 to $3 lower with August at $427.40 a troy
ounce; silver was 8.5 cents to 8.8 cents lower with September at
$6.63 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid conflicting views about future beef demand and cash prices,
analysts said. Pork futures retreated on weakening cash prices.
   Live cattle settled .28 cent lower to .38 cent higher with
August at 68.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.53 cent higher with August at 79.90 cents a pound; hogs were .15
cent to 1.30 cents lower with August at 45.45 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .15 cent to .45 cent lower with August at 32.80
cents a pound.
   Oil prices weakened in quiet trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Analysts said the slump was a reaction to Monday's sharp
runup.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 30 cents
lower with September at $15.68 a barrel; heating oil was .43 cent
to .53 cent lower with September at 44.07 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .35 cent to .61 cent lower with September at 46.15
cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's 500 index settled 2.40 points lower at 267.40.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investment banker Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
will buy the commodities brokerage business of Staley Continental
Inc. for an undisclosed amount, the companies said Tuesday.
   The sale of Staley Commodities International Inc. marks the
second divestment of a major Staley asset since early June, when
London-based sugar refiner Tate & Lyle PLC completed its $1.5
billion acquisition of the Rolling Meadows, Ill.-based company.
   Tate & Lyle said when it set out to buy Staley that it would
keep only Staley's corn syrup refining business, the second-largest
such operation in the nation. Tate & Lyle sold Staley's
food-service business to Sysco Corp. for $700 million in June.
   Staley established Staley Commodities in 1976 to handle its own
commodity brokerage requirements. The brokerage has since grown to
become a member of the Chicago Board of Trade with 26 seats on
various commodity exchanges.
   The sale agreement calls for New York-based Drexel to transact,
for at least two years, the agricultural hedging operations
previously handled by Staley Commodities.
   Staley also agreed to drop a 1987 lawsuit alleging that Drexel
had tried to ``extort'' Staley's management into a takeover and had
manipulated Staley's stock to thwart a stock offering.
   Drexel had denied the allegations.
   Drexel officials said in a statement that the acquisition of
Staley Commodities was an important addition to Drexel's commercial
grain futures brokerage business, one of the country's largest.
   Staley Commodities account executives will be invited to join
Drexel, the companies said.

<HEAD>House Approves Tariff-Free Trade Pact With Canada</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 7th graf, ``Counterpart legislation xxx to CORRECT that
Canadian bill not yet in Senate</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to
sweep away most tariffs and a wide array of other barriers to the
annual $166 billion trade in goods and services between the United
States and Canada.
   ``We have a bill here, in short, in which everyone gains and no
one loses,'' Rep. William Frenzel, R-Minn., said as the House
approved 366-40 and sent to the Senate the free-trade agreement
signed by President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney last January.
   The measure would authorize the president to phase out most
tariffs between the two countries over the next 10 years, and
approves elimination of a wide range of other trade barriers under
the pact.
   Many lawmakers said such a free-trade zone is needed as a
counterbalance to European Common Market protectionism.
   ``Many of the Europeans are talking about free trade as being
something for Europeans within that bloc _ I hope they don't go
that way,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, his party's vice
presidential candidate, as his Senate Finance Committee approved
the measure earlier Tuesday.
   The Senate is expected to act soon, possibly later this week, on
the measure.
   Counterpart legislation is stalled in Canada, where it is
encountering Liberal Party opposition.
   The agreement does not set up a common market between the United
States and Canada. That would mean adopting common tariffs on
imports from third countries.
   The free-trade zone would merely eliminate tariffs and some
other barriers between the United States and Canada. The two
countries would still have differing tariffs on imports from third
countries.
   The United States and Israel already have established a
free-trade zone.
   Advocates of the agreement claim it will spur U.S. exports and
create jobs while lowering consumer prices. Critics say agriculture
and assorted other industries could be hurt by lowering tariffs.
   Tariffs currently apply to about 25 percent of trade between the
United States and Canada, and the rest already is duty-free.
   Ten percent of existing tariffs, applying to goods ranging from
telecommunications equipment to whiskey and rum, would be
eliminated immediately under the agreement and the rest over the
next decade.
   The agreement would ease the way for U.S. citizens and Canadians
to invest in each others' countries. It would clear away barriers
to exports of many services but would exempt transportation and
cultural services.
   It would eliminate barriers to import and export of crude oil,
petroleum products, natural gas, coal, electricity, uranium and
other nuclear fuels.
   The measure has dismayed the U.S. uranium industry, which
stalled U.S. approval of the bill while it pressed for a
substantial subsidy to offset Canadian imports.
   The agreement would eliminate tariffs on autos and auto parts,
accounting for one-third of all trade between the countries, over
the next decade. As things stand, 95 percent of auto trade between
the United States and Canada already moves duty-free.
   To get duty-free treatment, autos and auto parts would have to
be 50 percent manufactured in North America.
   Rep. Donald J. Pease, D-Ohio, said he would support the measure
even though he was upset over the auto provisions. ``They improve
the status quo (but) I strongly believe they fall far short of the
advantages that benefit the Canadian auto industry,'' he said.
   Pease said the agreement should contain provisions that would
bar duty-free imports of autos and automotive products assembled in
Canada from parts manufactured in third countries.
   Among the bill's opponents, Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said the
agreement would ``leave us with Canadian agricultural markets that
are largely closed to American agricultural producers and American
markets that are largely open to Canadian agricultural producers,
and I'm concerned about that.''
   He singled out Canadian rail subsidies for grain shipped through
the huge lake port at Thunder Bay, Ontario., under the century-old
Crow's Nest Act.
   American producers receive nothing similar and thus would be
treated unfairly, Dorgan said.
   Under the pact, the Canadians did agree to end rail subsidies
for grain shipped through their western port of Vancouver.
   Another farm lawmaker, Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb., said he was
confident the measure would protect not only wheat but corn, sugar
and dry edible beans from a wave of Canadian imports.
   He said the agreement would improve the chances of success in
the current Uruguay Round of negotiations to modernize the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and thus ``end the subsidy shootout
in which the only winners are the giddy, greedy buyers, happily
snatching up agricultural commodities at prices below the cost of
production.''

<HEAD>Pennzoil Posts $1.4 Billion Quarterly Profit Due To Texaco
Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennzoil Co. posted $1.4 billion in second
quarter net income on Tuesday, due to the cash settlement of its
historic court battle with Texaco Inc., but suffered an operating
loss due mainly to one-time charges.
   Pennzoil's profit, amounting to $34.68 per share, compared with
a profit of $7.8 million, or 9 cents per share, in the second
quarter of 1987.
   The second quarter 1988 figures included a $1.7 billion
after-tax gain from its $3 billion settlement with Texaco. The
companies negotiated the settlement after Pennzoil won an $11.1
billion court judgment in a 1985 state court trial that decided
Texaco had interfered with Pennzoil's plan to buy Getty Oil Co.
   Revenue during the quarter, excluding the one-time settlement,
rose to $548 million from $443 million.
   Results for the quarter also included after-tax non-cash charges
of $303 million, including a $242 million charge for the impairment
and abandonment of some domestic and foreign oil and gas
properties, a $72 million charge for the writedown of a Shreveport,
La. refinery, and $28 million in charges related to employee
benefits and miscellaneous items.
   One-time gains included a $38.7 million gain from the sale of
Pennzoil interests in its Dutch North Sea oil and gas properties,
the company said.
   Pennzoil posted a loss from operations of $266.8 million during
the quarter.
   Income before the extraordinary gain and charges for the second
quarter was $36 million, compared with $17.8 million for the same
period last year.
   For the six months, net income was $1.4 billion, or $34.48 per
share, comapred with $21.7 million, or 33 cents a share, in the
same period last year. Revenue for the six months rose to $1
billion from $888 million in 1987.

<HEAD>FSLIC Settles With Philadelphia Law Firm For $50 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law firm has agreed to a record $50
million settlement of a Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
lawsuit over the firm's management of a thrift that closed two
years ago, the FSLIC announced Tuesday.
   Proceeds of the settlement with the Philadelphia-based firm of
Blank, Rome, Comisky & McCauley will be shared by the FSLIC with
former stockholders of Sunrise Savings and Loan Association of
Boynton Beach, Fla.
   The settlement, which the FSLIC said was the largest ever paid
to it by a law firm to settle a claim, included establishment of a
$10 million indemnity fund to cover any claims by outside parties
against the firm, which represented Sunrise.
   The federal suit filed in 1986 charged the law firm acted
negligently in advising Sunrise, improperly closed loans, aided
former Sunrise officials in violating several statutes and banking
regulations and represented parties with conflicts of interest.
   ``This settlement demonstrates that where violations
contributing to insolvency are caused by the negligence or
malpractice of professionals, including law firms, the (Federal
Home Loan) Bank Board will hold them, as well as thrift management,
fully responsible and accountable,'' said M. Danny Wall, chairman
of the bank board.
   The FSLIC sued the thrift's former officers, directors and
lawyers, including 87 partners and former partners at Blank Rome.
   Under the agreement, the FSLIC will receive 72 percent of the
first $40 million and 95 percent of the remaining $10 million.
Unused funds will revert to the FSLIC and shareholders by August
1992.
   Sunrise was closed in 1986 and insured accounts were transferred
to the newly created Beach Federal Savings and Loan Association.
   Blank Rome senior partner Michael Foxman founded Sunrise in
1980. His law firm colleague, M. Kalman Gitomer, once served as
chairman of the thrift.
   David Berger, a Philadelphia attorney representing the
shareholders, said it was an ``excellent settlement.''
   David Girard-di Carlo, managing partner of Blank Rome, said
Tuesday the settlement was in the best interest of the firm, but
said the firm continued to deny the allegations.

<HEAD>Rogers Sells U.S. Cable TV Business To Houston Industries</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rogers Communications Inc. has agreed to sell its
U.S. cable television business to a subsidiary of Texas-based
Houston Industries for $1.3 billion, the companies announced
Tuesday.
   The sale to KBL Cable still must be approved by Houston's board
of directors and U.S. regulatory agencies.
   The Toronto-based Rogers announced its intention to sell its
U.S. cable business in April, to give the company an opportunity to
reduce its debt of almost $987 million.
   Rogers has roughly 525,000 subscribers in the United States.
   Ironically, U.S. interest in Rogers was at the heart of the
decision to sell.
   The number of U.S. shareholders exceeded the Canadian
government's guidelines on foreign ownership of cable operators. In
a series of stock buybacks designed to reduce that foreign
ownership, Rogers spent roughly $350 million, incurring a lot of
debt in the process.
   Houston Industries, a utility holding company serving about 1.3
million customers in the Houston area, has a 50 percent interest in
Paragon Communications, which operates U.S. cable systems with more
than 670,000 subscribers in Texas, California and several other
states.
   Rogers has 1.5 million cable subscribers in Canada, owns Toronto
television station CFMT-TV and is the dominant shareholder in the
Canadian Home Shopping Network.

   The partial merger of two Detroit newspapers may not have an
immediate impact across the industry, analysts say, but it could
set the tone for the future with the market becoming more
concentrated and the wealthiest media companies growing more
powerful.
   The deal approved this week by U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III brings together Gannett Co. Inc., owner of the Detroit News,
and Knight-Ridder Inc., owner of the Detroit Free Press, in a deal
four times larger than any joint operating agreement approved under
the Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970.
   While the move is designed to preserve two independent editorial
voices in a big metropolitan market, some analysts and scholars
still raise questions about the move's competitive impact.
   Critics charge the Detroit combination is a step toward further
concentration of the industry where the trend is toward chain
ownership and media conglomerates and where the number of
independently owned papers is fading.
   ``This means that eventually there will be no city in the
country left with competing papers and then pressure will be more
immediate to wipe out the little competition that's left in the
form of alternative papers, community papers and suburban papers,''
said Bruce B. Brugmann, publisher of the San Francisco Bay Guardian.
   William Keating, chief executive officer of the Detroit
Newspaper Agency that will oversee the merger, believes joint
operating arrangements make good economic sense in an industry
where second place often leads to financial failure.
   In the Detroit case, the advertising market share _ where a
newspaper gets the bulk of its revenue _ had become so heavily
weighted in favor of the Detroit News that the Free Press couldn't
survive, Keating said.
   He said joint operating arrangements will continue to benefit
the industry by saving newspapers too weak to survive on their own.
   ``Some newspapers will be saved by reason of a (joint operating
agreement),'' said Keating.
   The danger in concentration, however, is that it could dilute
competition by shifting power from the readers to media owners, who
are in the position to charge higher prices for circulation and
advertising.
   ``All we really know is that prices are going to go up,'' said
Stephen Lacy, professor at Michigan State University who has
studied joint newspaper agreements and approves of the Detroit
arrangement.
   ``They'll be cutting their costs and increasing their revenues.
It's the same thing that happens in any monopoly situation,'' Lacy
said.
   Lacy predicted that Detroit newsstand prices, now among the
lowest in the nation at between 15 cents and 20 cents per copy,
could be raised to the industry average of 35 cents within the next
few years.
   Alan Lenhoff, spokesman for the Detroit Free Press, indicated
Tuesday that prices will go up, but would not say when or by how
much.
   ``What you have in Detroit are among the lowest newspaper
circulation prices and advertising rates in the country,'' Lenhoff
said. ``Both have been losing approximately $30 million a year.
Logic would tell you that some changes are coming but it has not
been announced to what extent.''
   Lenhoff said an announcement may be forthcoming before the
merger takes effect on Aug. 19.
   In 1920, 700 cities had competing dailies. Today, there are 22.
Eighty percent of daily circulation is controlled by chains, and
chains have begun to merge with each other.
   Gannett, who has absorbed other chains in recent years, is not a
newcomer to joint newspaper agreements. The company is now an owner
in eight of the 20 joint contracts and Knight-Ridder is an owner in
three.
   Under the partial merger approved Monday, the Detroit
Newspapers, among the 10 largest in the country, will merge
production, advertising and circulation departments for 100 years,
while maintaining separate editorial and news departments.
   Although such a merger is illegal for other businesses under
antitrust law, the 1970 Newspaper Preservation Act granted
newspapers selective exemption from the law if one of the
newspapers is failing financially. The legislative intent was to
preserve an editorial voice where one otherwise might be lost.
   Some analysts say the Detroit case could set a precedent for
other large metropolitan newspapers. But others say there are few
cities with competing papers ripe for such a merger.
   Of the 22 cities with separately owned, competing dailies, only
a handful are potential candidates for joint agreements, including
Denver, Dallas, Chicago and Boston.
   ``There are so few markets where people would even want to get
together and talk about it,'' Lacy said.

<HEAD>Batus Sweetens Offer For Farmers Group To $72 A Share From $63</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Batus Inc., struggling to win regulatory
approval for a hostile takeover of Farmers Group Inc., sweetened
its buyout offer Tuesday to more than $4.9 billion from $4.5
billion in an apparent attempt to win a friendly agreement.
   Farmers, a major insurance holding company, stated late Tuesday
that its board would give ``careful consideration'' to the latest
offer.
   Batus raised its offer to $72 cash a share for Farmers' 68.4
million common shares outstanding from the previous $63 a share
bid, and conditioned the sweetened offer on the negotiation of a
definitive merger agreement by Aug. 19.
   Farmers stock rose 12{ cents to $57.75 a share Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange. The sweetened offer was disclosed hours
after the market closed.
   Farmers has resisted the overtures by Batus, the U.S. arm of
British conglomerate BAT Industries PLC, since its initial $60 a
share, or $4.2 billion, buyout offer in January.
   Batus also has been attempting to win approval of the hostile
takeover by the insurance commissioners of the nine states in which
Farmers does business, with mixed success.
   Farmers noted three of the states _ Oregon, Idaho and Washington
_ have rejected the takeover due to issues unrelated to the price
offered by Batus. California also has rejected the proposal, but
that decision recently was overturned by a state court. Farmers is
appealing the reversal.
   Batus, which is based in Louisville, Ky., owns operations that
include Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. and several retailers, led
by New York's Saks Fifth Avenue.
