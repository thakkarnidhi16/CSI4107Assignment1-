   President Reagan has given ``recess
appointments'' to about 30 people to maintain continuity in various
agencies, boards and commissions while Congress is in recess, press
spokesmen said Tuesday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said names of most of the
candidates for the posts had been submitted to Congress earlier but
had not been confirmed by the time adjournment came on Oct. 23.
   Fitzwater also said that Reagan administration Cabinet officers
and agency heads had been asked to provide the Bush transition team
with information on issues facing their agencies.
   Briefing reporters who accompanied Reagan to southern California
for the president's six-day vacation, Fitzwater said the Bush team
was seeking information ``of a routine nature,'' including
department and agency organizational charts, missions and
chains-of-command.
   Fitzwater said that White House chief of staff Kenneth
Duberstein, who also is the head of Reagan's transition team, asked
that the information be provided to the Bush people no later than
Friday.
   Noting that top-level executive branch political appointees had
been asked earlier to offer resignation letters to give Bush more
hiring flexibility, Fitzwater said, ``I don't interpret this as any
kind of hit list or any special effort to weed out people or
anything like that. It simply is a routine description of jobs,
functions, people, etc.''
   As for the recess appointees, he said, ``With the exception of
the few people that are being appointed to fixed-term positions, all
are being asked to submit their resignations with their
appointments.''
   He said the appointments were necessary because, ``in some cases
we have boards and commissions and so forth that need people in them
so they have a quorum. ... In other cases, they fill positions that
have decisions coming up in the next few months and we feel that
they should be filled.''
   Among the 32 recess appointments announced Tuesday were these:
   _William Andreas Brown, former ambassador to Thailand, to succeed
Thomas R. Pickering as the U.S. envoy to Israel.
   _Margot E. Machol, to be a commissioner on the Federal Trade
Commission.
   _Jill Houghton Emery to be director of the Women's Bureau at the
Department of Labor, succeeding Shirley Dennis.
   _Dennis Devaney to be a member of the National Labor Relations
Board for the remainder of a term expiring Dec. 16, 1989, succeeding
Marshall B. Babson.
   _Becky Norton Dunlop, to be assistant secretary for fish and
wildlife at the Interior Department.
   _Mary L. Schapiro, a lobbyist for the commodity futures industry,
to be a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission for a term
to expire next June.

   Emergency planners opened shelters and warned
residents along Florida's Gulf Coast to stock up Tuesday as Tropical
Storm Keith brought its near-65 mph winds and torrential rains
toward land.
   Eighty-five multimillion-dollar F-16 jets were flown from MacDill
Air Force Base to Dobbins Air Force Base at Marietta, Ga., to wait
out the storm.
   State officials ordered sand moved to beach areas for
replenishment after the predicted erosion from the rain.
   The storm was expected to hit the coast before dawn Wednesday,
but heavy rains and wind gusts were being felt in some areas by
midday Tuesday.
   Forecasters predicted Keith would hit land near Clearwater in
Pinellas County east of Tampa, cross the Florida peninsula and head
into the Atlantic Ocean north of Cape Canaveral late Wednesday
morning or early afternoon.
   At 11 p.m. EST, the storm was centered near latitude 27.5 north
and longitude 83.5 west, about 65 miles southwest of Tampa. The
storm was moving northeast at 15 to 20 mph with maximum sustained
winds near 65 mph.
   A 216-foot freighter, Percy Navigator, with 10 people aboard
stalled Tuesday, about 140 miles west of Fort Myers, the U.S. Coast
Guard said. The freighter was in 15-foot seas and more than 63 mph
winds, but was not in immediate danger, Petty Officer Joe Dye said.
   A Coast Guard cutter was expected to rendezvous with the
freighter early Wednesday to tow the vessel to safe port, Dye said.
An H-3 helicopter from Clearwater was prepared to fly to the
freighter to rescue those aboard if necessary, Dye said. He said the
ship stalled when an air conditioner line broke and flooded the
engine room.
   Emergency teams in counties along much of the state's Gulf Coast
met throughout the day with public safety, medical, road, health,
and law enforcement personnel to revise plans as reports came in on
the progress of the late-season storm.
   Forecasters issued a tropical storm warning from Cape Sable at
the state's southwestern tip, north to Cedar Key on the Gulf Coast,
a distance of about 250 miles. They extended the warning late
Tuesday to the Atlantic Coast from Jupiter Inlet, north of Palm
Beach, to Savannah, Ga.
   However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said a cold
front from the north was mingling with Keith in the Gulf of Mexico,
keeping it from gaining strength. Its winds were slightly below 65
mph.
   ``It's extremely unlikely it would strengthen,'' said forecaster
Colin McAdie. ``It will lose strength as it crosses land.''
   Keith was expected to dump up to 5 inches of rain and bring storm
tides of 4 feet down Florida's Gulf Coast.
   Forecasters urged residents to avoid travel. Besides flooding
roads with huge downpours, tropical storms are capable of spinning
off tornadoes.
   In Lake County, a tornado struck a mobile home park south of
Leesburg and then skipped across a field and damaged homes in
another park Tuesday morning, said Bob Reymont, director for
emergency management.
   No one was injured, but Reymont said 5 to 10 homes, two vans, a
small boat and a car were damaged at one mobile home park, and about
15 trailer homes were slightly damaged at another.
   In Pinellas County, which encompasses St. Petersburg, the Red
Cross readied shelters for people living along Gulf-front beaches,
in mobile homes or flood-prone areas.
   ``We're advising the public to sit and ride it out,'' said
Stephanie Riley, emergency planner for Sarasota.
   To the south in Lee County, planners advised residents to take
stock of emergency supplies of food, water, batteries and candles.
   ``We're asking them to check anything they might need if they are
without food or electricity,'' said David Saniter, emergency
coordinator in Fort Myers.
   ``Basically, we're saying there's no life-threatening situation.
We're going to get some rains _ much-needed rains _ and some high
winds. Prepare yourselves, your houses and your yards.''
   On Monday, the storm's rain soaked an area from Mexico to the
Florida Keys. On Cuba, civil defense authorities report at least
2,500 people were evacuated.
   If Keith's winds reach over 74 mph, it would become the sixth
hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, which runs from June through
Nov. 30. Keith is the 11th named storm of the season.

   A man who startled observers by carrying a
starter pistol to a pre-election campaign rally for Vice President
George Bush was indicted Tuesday on disorderly conduct charges.
   A federal grand jury brought the charges against John Arthur
Junot, 40, of Los Angeles, who was arrested Nov. 6 and charged with
disorderly conduct under state law.
   Junot was about 50 yards away from the vice president, who was
addressing a suburban Los Angeles crowd of about 10,000 on gun
control, when the gun fell to the ground. He fled as bystanders
yelled he had a weapon and police arrested him moments later.
   There was no indication Bush even noticed the incident.
   Evidence showed Junot planned several weeks in advance of the
Bush rally to take the pistol, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Julie
Blackshaw. Among the evidence was a poem allegedly written by Junot
for John Hinckley, the man who shot President Reagan.
   Police said the starter pistol was the type normally used at
track and field events and resembles a handgun, although it fires
only blanks.
   Junot faces up to six months in prison and a $5,000 fine if
convicted.
   Arraignment was set for Monday.

   Blacks are angry that the state is
considering a January parole hearing for the man convicted of
killing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the head of a black
political organization said Monday.
   The hearing was announced last week for James Earl Ray, 60,
serving 99 years for assassinating King in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
   Meanwhile, Ray said in an interview for ``The Morton Downey Jr.
Show'' that he was coerced by the FBI into pleading guilty to cover
up a government conspiracy. The interview, released Monday, is
believed to be Ray's first television interview since 1975, said
Bill Boggs, the show's executive producer.
   Under a 1985 law providing parole hearings for long-term
prisoners after 20 years, Ray became eligible for parole
consideration this month.
   The law was designed to allow the state to relieve overcrowding
of the prison system. A federal court has ordered the state to
upgrade the system, and 3,500 cells are planned, including three
maximum-security prisons.
   James M. Brown of Pulaski, chairman of the Tennessee Voters
Council and a member of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday
Committee, called the parole hearing for Ray ``cruel, dangerous and
shameful,'' and said he would ask Gov. Ned McWherter to call it off.
He noted the hearing in January would coincide with the Jan. 16
holiday honoring the civil rights leader's birthday.
   Brown said Tennesseans were told that Ray would not be eligible
for release until the next century. Because of the early parole
hearing, Brown said, ``black people across this state are mad as
hell. It's an insult to all black people to even consider such a
thing.''
   McWherter said he could not call the hearing off since the board
is independent of him, but said he agreed that the projected hearing
``was a disgrace to all the citizens of Tennessee. I would urge the
board not to consider a parole for Ray.''
   However, he said he would not interfere with the board's decision.
   The chairman of the state Parole Board, Charles Traughber, who is
black, said the board simply was following the law. The hearing was
delayed until January to give the board a chance to gather
information on Ray's prison record as well as his psychological
evaluation.
   Ray twice tried to escape from prison, including a briefly
successful breakout in 1977. In 1982, he was stabbed 22 times by
other inmates at Brushy Mountain State Prison in eastern Tennessee
and transferred to a different prison.
   Ray, who pleaded guilty on the day his trial was to begin on
March 9, 1969, recanted three days later but never has been able to
get a full-blown trial to back up his contention that he was
innocent.
   ``I doubt very much they'll give me a parole,'' Ray told a
reporter. ``I think the only way I'll get out of here is through a
jury. If they wouldn't grant me a trial I don't see how they'll
grant me a parole.''
   In the interview to be broadcast next Monday on the syndicated
television program, Ray claimed the government has withheld evidence
in his case to conceal its connection to the assassination.
   He alleges the FBI threatened to jail his father and brother if
he didn't sign a confession. Ray's father was a fugitive from prison
and his brother spent several years in jail.
   Ray said two men who later disappeared had been with him in
Memphis when King was killed. Ray said the men were FBI agents
assigned to set up a white Southerner as the murderer. Ray's claims
have not been substantiated.
   Mark Lane, a lawyer who has studied the assassination, said
during the taped program that the congressional committee
investigating the death was pressured by the government to withhold
information.
   Lane said committee Chairman Walter Fauntroy, the District of
Columbia delegate, had told him he believed the FBI killed King.
   Fauntroy was not at his Washington home Monday night for
immediate comment, said a person who answered his telephone.

   The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra crossed the
Hudson to Carnegie Hall and showed the nation's cultural capital it
has the right to escape the label of geographical filler between the
New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia Orchestra.
   Under music director Hugh Wolff, in his fourth season, the group
is polished and assured, not to mention solvent and musically
stable. Though it still plays in a half-dozen leaky concert halls
around New Jersey without a permanent home, gone are the days of
near-bankruptcy and cancelled seasons.
   Monday night's concert, subtitled ``Music Turns the Century,''
featured three works composed in the 1890s: Richard Strauss's ``Don
Quixote,'' Claude Debussy's ``Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun''
and Charles Ives' Symphony No 2. The idea is part of Wolff's attempt
to give the orchestra a strong identity, and, to concert-goers used
to New York's musical riches, a reason to buy tickets.
   The idea worked on one count. The pieces nicely complemented each
other, and featured the orchestra in two ways: they put its
first-chair players on display in the Debussy and Strauss, and
showed how well the orchestra played as one instrument in the Ives.
But Carnegie was only about two-thirds full.
   ``Don Quixote,'' a tone poem subtitled ``Fantastic Variations on
a Knightly Theme,'' portrays the adventures of Cervantes' don
through music. Musical variations evoke events in the novel, such as
the don's encounter with a flock of sheep and magical ride through
the air on a wooden horse.
   The busy and prize-winning solo cellist Carter Brey played a
polished and vivid Don Quixote, and first violist Frank Foerster was
an effectively scampering and lyric Sancho Panza.
   Written while Strauss was working on ``A Hero's Life,'' ``Don
Quixote'' has a sense of parody and wry commentary on the knight's
Walter Mitty adventures. But the music also shows his nobility.
   Brey captured all that. He played with humor and personality, not
afraid of frequent portamento, including one long, pathetic slide at
the end to signify Quixote's death. In passages with first desk
strings, he looked directly at his colleagues and played chamber
music.
   Often, the brass and winds seemed to overpower the strings,
particularly first violins. And on the other extreme, when big
effects were called for _ such as the sharp, loud chords before the
cello entrance in the introduction, or the climactic moments of
battle scenes in the later variations _ one wanted Wolff to let
loose just a little bit more.
   The Debussy, a meditation on a work of French poet Stephane
Mallarme, was nicely shaped by the 36-year-old conductor, with wind
solos growing out of each other and subtle volume changes. But Wolff
did not step into the sublime; his ritards were adequate, the
strings shimmered only modestly.
   But it was a nice transition to the Ives, perhaps the Connecticut
insurance executive's most accessible symphony, written when he was
in his 20s. The piece has constant snatches of Americana _
``Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,'' ``America the Beautiful,''
``Camptown Races'' _ as well as bits from Brahms, Dvorak and
Beethoven.
   Here the orchestra sounded more integrated, and also produced one
of the most beautiful moments of the evening: the serene opening
section, strings alone, of the first movement. Wolff shaped the
lines well, spurring them on at the right moments.
   The orchestra played with suitable passion in the Brahmsian
fourth movement, and the strings showed agility in the last
movement, which ended in a monumentally discordant blast after a
seemingly conventional buildup. Only then did the orchestra show the
power it seems to be capable of.

   Unrest sparked by ethnic tensions and
a political drive to jolt Yugoslavia out of economic torpor has
produced very different demonstrations in the developing south and
more affluent north.
   In the south, protests continued for a fifth straight day Monday
over the forced resignations of two leaders from the ethnic Albanian
majority in the troubled province of Kosovo.
   At least 7,000 people defied threats of a crackdown on the
biggest wave of demonstrations since World War II in the province
that borders Albania. They trudged 40 miles from two towns to the
provincial capital of Pristina, and dispersed only after repeated
appeals.
   In the liberal northern republic of Slovenia, about 13,000 people
gathered in driving snow to demand the acquittal of four men
sentenced to jail last summer for making public a classified
military document.
   The rallies, in the capital Ljubljana and in nearby Celje, also
demanded an unprecedented republic-wide referendum on changes to the
Yugoslav constitution due to be passed next week by the Communist
leaderships of the country's six republics.
   Many Slovenians fear the changes will curb the slow process of
democratization in their prosperous, westward-looking republic by
giving more power to federal authorities.
   Communist authorities say the amendments to Yugoslavia's clumsy
1974 constitution are needed so market-oriented economic reforms can
be implemented. Yugoslavia is beset by 236 percent annual inflation
and 15 percent unemployment.
   Slobodan Milosevic, Communist party leader in the largest
republic of Serbia, is trying to use the constitutional changes to
get more control over Serbia's semi-autonomous provinces of Kosovo
and Vojvodina.
   His drive over Kosovo, fanned by allegations of ethnic Albanian
harassment of the province's Serb minority, has rallied hundreds of
thousands of Serbs behind his cause.
   But Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have resisted the drive to curb the
autonomy they won under the 1974 constitution.
   Last week's resignations of Azem Vlasi and Kacusa Jasari, both
members of Kosov's 13-member ruling Politburo, appear to have been
the spark that drove ethnic Albanians into the streets for the first
time since 1981, when at least nine people died in clashes.
   The two stepped down under pressure from Milosevic, who wants
greater control over Kosovo for Serbia, and as many as 100,000
ethnic Albanians took to the streets of Pristina over the weekend,
demanding they be reinstated.
   After warnings emergency measures would be imposed if unrest did
not cease, the demonstrations became much smaller. But another 4,000
people rallied Sunday, and at least 7,000 demonstrated on Monday.
   Under the proposed constitutional amendments, Milosevic wants to
restore Serbian control over Kosovo's judiciary, education and
policing. Communist leaders in Yugoslavia's other republics see his
campaign as a drive to increase the influence of Serbia on the loose
Yugoslav federation.
   But Milosevic claims the changes would only put Serbia on an
equal footing with other republics, which have no administrative
provinces like Kosovo and Vojvodina.
   One of Monday's rallies dispersed after a surprise speech by a
Serbian factory worker from the Kosovan town of Orohavac, which is
about 260 miles from Belgrade.
   The worker, Ruzica Isma, flew in the face of widespread Serbian
allegations of ethnic Albanian harassment, saying she had never
experienced such.
   Wildly cheered by flag-waving, chanting ethnic Albanians, she
declared, ``We will not let anyone impose constitutional changes
that people don't want ... As long as there is a contest, we will
assemble like this every day, day and night, rain or snow.''
   Yugoslavia, a nation of 23 million, split from the Soviet bloc in
1948.

   Margaret C. ``Peggy'' Parrish, the author of
dozens of popular, educational and entertaining children's books
including the ``Amelia Bedelia'' series, has died at age 61.
   She died Friday of a ruptured abdominal aneurism, hospital
authorities said.
   Although she never married, Miss Parish loved children and
received and answered nearly 100 letters a day from fans, said her
brother, Dr. H.S. Parish Jr.
   Miss Parish's publishers invited schoolchildren to write
greetings this year to help celebrate the 25th anniversary of the
first book about Amelia Bedelia, a mistake-prone, literal-minded
maid _ the kind of character who puts sponge in spongecake.
   In addition to the Amelia Bedelia series, Miss Parish also was
the author of such books as ``The Cats' Burglar,'' `Dinosaur Time,''
``The Ghosts of Cougar Island,'' ``Good Hunting Little Indian,''
``Hermit Dan'' and ``Let's Be Early Settlers with Daniel Boone.''
   Miss Parish, a former schoolteacher, loved children because they
``get down to the basics and they love simple situations,'' her
brother said.
   ``She was just enthralled with kids and she had no greater
pleasure than telling stories at schools and writing books,'' he
said.
   In addition to her brother, Miss Parish is survived by a
stepsister.
   Funeral services were scheduled for 2 p.m. Tuesday in Manning.

   Hollywood stars today are ``sort of a strange
breed'' who really don't know how to dress well, says Rodeo Drive
dress shop owner Herbert Fink.
   ``Some of them reach stardom very quickly. Quite often they're
from small, unsophisticated areas, so they really have no idea of
how to dress. They wear the wrong colors, the wrong styles. They
have all this money and they almost don't know how to spend it,'' he
said in this week's TV Guide.
   ``Dynasty'' designer Nolan Miller agreed. Asked to name six
Hollywood women with class and taste, Miller could only come up with
two from his show: Diahann Carroll and Linda Evans.
   ``All you have to do is catch a plane to see how far fashion has
gone downhill,'' he said. ``You see actresses in jogging suits.''
   But ``Wheel of Fortune'' co-host Vanna White said fans prefer the
casual look.
   ``They think I'm a real person,'' she said. ``I mean, I wear nice
sweats. I'm presentable. And I think it's great because stars are
humans, just like everybody else.''

   It's only a series of simple ``hellos,'' but
when the greeters include President Reagan, Rajiv Gandhi and Prince
Charles among others, two Nebraska brothers think it can add up to
world peace.
   ``I guess when you get the heads of states of 100 countries
together on anything you have really accomplished something,'' said
Michael McCormack, who along with his 31-year-old brother, Brian,
started World Hello Day 15 years ago.
   More than 100 world leaders have passed along greetings of
``hello'' and peace this year, including Reagan, Prime Minister
Gandhi of India and Israeli President Chaim Herzog, McCormack said
Monday.
   McCormack, 36, was attending Harvard University in 1973 when he

   Ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov is making
his theatrical debut at Duke University as a man who turns into an
insect in Franz Kafka's horrific novella, ``The Metamorphosis.''
   Ron Kumin, Duke's drama administrative director, said he was
approached by producers of the pre-Broadway production because
Baryshnikov wanted a ``less traditional, more relaxed'' setting for
his dramatic debut.
   Baryshnikov, whose film credits include ``The Turning Point'' and
``White Nights,'' will make his stage debut Feb. 3. Performances of
the play, co-produced by Roger Stevens and Lars Schmidt, will run
through Feb. 25, Kumin said this week.

   Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin, sporting a
four-day growth of beard, mounted a horse to play a role in the
television series ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   Corbin's hobby, searching for the Lost Dutchman gold mine in the
Superstition Mountains, led to the role in a segment about the death
of Walt Gassler, who may have discovered the 19th-century mine.
   Corbin and a friend, Tom Kollenborn of Apache Junction, were
filmed last weekend making a mock search for the mine, which
included a visit to a re-creation of Gassler's camp.
   The segment is tentatively scheduled for broadcast in February.

   ``The Land Before Time,'' the animated tale of a
baby dinosaur's perilous journey through a prehistoric world, made
its debut as the top box office attraction, trampling the stylish
horror movie ``Child's Play.''
   ``The Land Before Time'' grossed $7.5 million last weekend as the
holiday movie season began.
   ``Child's Play,'' the story of a psychopathic doll named Chucky,
was next with $5.2 million in its second week of release. In third
was ``Ernest Saves Christmas,'' in which a loony cabdriver (Jim
Varney) rescues the holiday by driving Santa's sleigh. ``Ernest''
reported ticket sales of $4.8 million.
   ``Oliver and Co.,'' the second animated film to open last
weekend, finished far behind ``The Land Before Time'' in fourth
place. ``Oliver and Co.,'' using a variety of celebrity voices,
including Bette Midler's, to recount the Oliver Twist-inspired story
of a homeless kitten, grossed $4 million.
   ``High Spirits,'' a new comic ghost story about an Irish castle
run by Peter O'Toole, got $3.3 million in receipts to finish in
fifth. The debut of ``Fresh Horses,'' a serious study of love
starring Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy, claimed sixth place
with ticket sales of $3.1 million.
   The only long-standing film in the top 10 was ``The Accused,''
finishing No. 7. The movie, featuring Jodie Foster in a chronicle of
rape and the justice system, grossed $1.903 million. ``Iron Eagle
II,'' a military adventure about U.S. and Soviet pilots joining
forces to prevent nuclear war, gathered $1.894 million to finish at
No. 8.
   In the last two top spots were ``Everybody's All American,''
starring Jessica Lange, with sales of $1.8 million, and ``1969,'' a
new movie about the Vietnam War's impact on everyday Americans,
which got $1.7 million.
   The holiday movie season expands this week. ``Cocoon: The
Return,'' starring Don Ameche, ``Scrooged,'' with Bill Murray, and
``Full Moon in Blue Water,'' featuring Gene Hackmann, open Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The specter of Reykjavik is hanging over the
scheduled meeting between President-elect George Bush and Kremlin
leader Mikhail Gorbachev in New York on Dec. 7.
   Bush said Monday he does not want the session to turn into an
anything-goes bargaining session, although his aides say they will
be going with open ears and minds.
   The Reagan administration took the same approach before an
October 1986 meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, between between
President Reagan and Gorbachev, billed in advance by the Americans
as a non-summit.
   In Reykjavik, however, Gorbachev engaged Reagan in bargaining
over the eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. That prospect
upset U.S. allies in Western Europe, who rely on American nuclear
deterrence and who complained they had not been fully consulted on
an arms cut as broad as Reagan was considering.
   After Reykjavik, the Reagan administration tried to match
Gorbachev's diplomatic pace, signing a treaty to eliminate some
intermediate-range nuclear weapons and making progress toward a
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START).
   Gorbachev will probably try to pressure Bush to match that pace.
   Bush told a news conference Monday that the New York session with
Gorbachev will not be the first Bush-Gorbachev summit, but will be
``President Reagan's meeting.''
   ``I'll be there as vice president of the United States and I
expect they'll be aware they're talking to the next president,'' he
said.
   ``In terms of specificity, in terms of my committing a brand new
administration to specifics in arms control or anything else, I'm
not going to do that,'' said Bush.
   But, said one Bush aide, ``we expect Gorbachev to try to advance
some of his ideas. And given his record, he may unveil some new
ones, right at the meeting.''
   ``We don't want this to turn into a summit, but we will be
listening,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Bush team thinks Gorbachev might try to break new ground in
START and in efforts to cut East-West conventional, or non-nuclear,
forces in Europe.
   Gorbachev may restate his desire for Soviet participation in a
proposed Middle East peace conference, perhaps trying a new twist in
the wake of a declaration of a Palestinian homeland by the
parliament of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The Bush camp believes Gorbachev will restate the Soviet intent
to withdraw its remaining troops from Afghanistan, although they
have halted that withdrawal to protest renewed offensives by Afghan
guerrillas.
   ``We think they just want to get out without being humiliated,''
said the Bush aide.
   Conventional and strategic arms control are considered the most
likely areas for a Gorbachev diplomatic initiative.
   Gorbachev and other Soviets have been talking for more than a
year about a new military doctrine of ``reasonable sufficiency,''
which could entail sharp cuts in Warsaw Pact conventional forces.
   So far, there has been no change in the deployment of
conventional Warsaw Pact forces, and Soviet chief of staff Sergei
Akhromeyev said during a Pentagon visit last summer that Moscow
would cut back only if Washington did likewise.
   ``But that doesn't mean that Gorbachev won't make a new proposal
on conventional arms. He knows it plays well in West Europe,'' said
the Bush aide.
   Gorbachev might also try to resolve disagreements that remained
after the Moscow summit last June over mobile missiles,
submarine-launched cruise missiles and limits to space tests of
anti-missile defenses.
   The dispute over Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative is the
most emotional obstacle to START. Gorbachev insists the United
States agree to abide for another decade by the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty, which bars space defenses.
   For its part, the United States insists mobile missiles be banned
under START. The Soviet Union has deployed two mobile missiles, the
10-warhead SS-25, based on rails, and the single-warhead SS-24,
based on trucks. America is devising, but has not deployed, a
rail-mobile system for the 10-warhead MX and is developing the
single-warhead road-mobile Midgetman.
   The Soviets, in turn, are insisting on strict limits for
submarine-launched nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, but the Reagan
administration has balked at the stringent verification procedures
that would be needed.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra Judge: Reagan Should Consider Whether To Stop North
Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case says
President Reagan should consider the ``various courses of action he
may take'' to stop the trial of Oliver L. North to prevent national
security secrets from being disclosed.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell did not say that Reagan
should consider pardoning the four Iran-Contra defendants but
suggested other means by which the trial could be stopped.
   He said that under the Classified Information Procedures Act,
Reagan could declare that the danger of disclosing highly sensitive
government secrets was so great that the charges must be dropped.
The president, as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, could
either directly order the case dropped or he could invoke secrecy
laws to prevent disclosure of classified information, which could
have the same effect.
   ``The Constitution does not permit the court to take this
testimony in secret, as did the Congress. It must be public,''
Gesell said, adding he would have ``very little control over the
content of the testimony.''
   ``Accordingly, if on analysis this imminent prospect gives ground
for presidential action to protect any perceived threat to the
foreign policy obligations which the president has or the
intelligence needs of the country, the Constitution and the statutes
provide various courses of action he may take,'' the judge said.
   Reagan, meanwhile, reiterated previous statements he had made on
the question when asked whether he would pardon North.
   ``No, and I don't think it's time for that while it's in the
courts,'' Reagan said at a ground-breaking ceremony for his
presidential library at Simi Valley, Calif.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The president
believes the legal process should take its course. The president is
not considering a pardon.''
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``We are fully aware that some documents and
evidence in the case pose significant security risks.'' When a
reporter suggested the White House was attempting to throw the
decision back to Gesell, the official did not disagree.
   The testimony of current or former government officials
``acquainted with high security matters'' poses a ``difficult
situation for those who may have foreign policy or national security
concerns,'' Gesell said at the hearing.
   These prosecution witnesses, who include former national security
adviser Robert McFarlane, ``will be subjected to intense
cross-examination'' by North's lawyers, the judge said.
   The defense ``will be granted wide latitude'' to question these
witnesses about their motives for testifying against the former
National Security Council aide.
   Gesell said such questioning might involve ``sensitive events
other than events relevant under the indictment.''
   Gesell, in urging Reagan to focus on the secrecy issue, said the
case was ``rapidly approaching trial,'' probably by late January.
   The judge made the comments at the conclusion of a two-hour
hearing on North's motions to dismiss the central conspiracy charges
against him and his three co-defendants, former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard
V. Secord.
   Separate trials have been ordered for each defendant.
   Gesell indicated that he wouldn't dismiss the charge that all
four defendants conspired to defraud the government by setting up
the secret arms-supply network for the Nicaraguan rebels and
diverted U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to finance the insurgents,
known as Contras.
   Gesell said defense lawyers could not ``legally wrap themselves
in the president's cloak'' unless it appeared that the president
directed the diversion of funds to the Contras and the obstruction
of inquiries into the matter.
   But he suggested that two other charges that the defendants stole
government property and committed wire fraud needlessly duplicated
the conspiracy count.
   He also expressed skepticism about whether prosecutors could
prove the defendants embezzled profits from the arms-for-hostage
sales, saying ``you don't know where the money went. You can't trace
the money.''
   ``The money did go in large part to the Contras,'' said Bruce A.
Green, an associate independent counsel. ``What we are alleging is
that money went in large part for other purposes... not authorized''
when Reagan approved the arms sales.
   The judge rebuked the Justice Department for its
friend-of-the-court brief challenging independent counsel Lawrence
E. Walsh's theory that North could be prosecuted for obstructing
congressional oversight of foreign policy.
   The Justice Department, invoking the separation-of-power
doctrine, said Walsh had overstated Congress' role in foreign
affairs, which it said was primarily a presidential function.
   Gesell said Reagan's authorization of North's prosecution refutes
the department's ``suggestion that independent counsel is acting in
disregard of the president's primary responsibility for the conduct
of foreign affairs and protection of national security.''

<BYLINE>Nixon: Quayle No `Intellectual Midget'
^By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dan Quayle is not the ``intellectual midget''
portrayed by the news media, says former President Richard M. Nixon.
   When the vice president-elect and the man who also was vice
president for eight years talked for the first time on Monday, they
discussed U.S.-Soviet relations, arms control negotiations between
the two superpowers and the role of the vice presidency.
   After the meeting, Nixon pronounced Quayle a man of intelligence
and dedication and said he'll be ``an excellent vice president.''
   ``I was very surprised. He is a very different man from the
intellectual midget who has been portrayed among the media,'' Nixon
told reporters at an impromptu news conference.
   He said the two had met before but ``this is the first time I had
a chance to have a talk with Senator Quayle.''
   ``This is a man who has strong views. He's highly intelligent.
He's highly dedicated,'' Nixon said.
   During their meeting, which lasted just over 90 minutes, Nixon
advised Quayle on the vice presidency, a post Nixon held from 1953
to 1961 under former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Nixon was elected president in 1968, serving until his
resignation in August 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
   ``The important thing for the vice president is to recognize that
his responsibility is to serve the interest of the country _ and
that means to serve the interest of the president,'' Nixon said.
   The advice he gave to Quayle was to ``follow the example of
George Bush. He's been a very successful vice president and it's
important that you follow his example in your handling of the
position.''
   Nixon refused to provide details of their foreign policy
discussion but said he and Quayle ``happen to share views ... that
are frankly a little inconsistent with some of the conventional
wisdom with regard to Soviet-American relations.''
   In September, Quayle questioned recent Soviet reforms, saying
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't very different from former
Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev and suggested that perestroika is
``nothing more than refined Stalinism.''
   Nixon, who chose not to define his views, did urge the new
administration to ``develop a diplomatic offensive to counter the
diplomatic offensive of Gorbachev.''
   The former president said he was confident that Bush would
succeed in arms control negotiations with the Soviets and also had
praise for Quayle in that area.
   ``At the present time I cannot think of six other senators who
know as much about the complexities of arms control as Senator Dan
Quayle,'' Nixon said. ``He will be a great asset to the
administration on this very important subject when it is considered
during the next administration.''
   Nixon also applauded Bush's recent administration appointments,
including the selection of New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu as White
House chief of staff.
   ``As I look at him, he's highly intelligent. He's very tough,''
Nixon said of Sununu. ``I think he's going to break some china but
he's a shrewd enough politician that he'll know how to put the china
together again.''

<HEAD>Report Says New Farm Bill Needs To Include Flexible Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional agency says the next major farm
bill should provide for flexible control of crop production so that
farmers can respond more readily to market opportunities.
   In one of a series of reports about issues in the forthcoming
Bush administration, the General Accounting Agency said the 1990
farm bill needs to retain the authority of the Agriculture
Department to influence crop production in times of surplus and
scarcity.
   But the GAO, an investigative arm of Congress, said the current
farm law, enacted in 1985, has had a number of shortcomings.
   The law has helped U.S. agriculture to become more competitive in
the world market while maintaining farm income, the report said.
   ``This success, however, has come at a cost much higher than that
of previous farm bills,'' the GAO said. ``Between fiscal years 1986
and 1988, farm price and income support programs averaged over $20
billion annually.''
   Farm programs should be designed to ``prevent the accumulation of
unneeded surpluses'' and still hold down the USDA's costs of
operating them, the report said.
   According to USDA budget figures, spending on farm commodity
supports soared to a record $25.8 billion in fiscal 1986, the first
year of operation under the 1985 law, but have declined since then.
   ``The 1985 farm bill moved farm programs in a more
market-oriented direction,'' the GAO said. ``However, rigidities in
the bill's production control provisions have discouraged farmers
from producing certain crops, even when commercial market conditions
are favorable.''
   For example, it said, the programs this year affected decisions
of farmers in the Corn Belt, who maintained their level of corn
plantings and did not expand their soybeans despite a strong soybean
market relative to corn.
   ``Increases in soybean acres may have improved market returns for
agriculture and tempered production expansion by foreign producers
who compete with U.S. farmers in world markets,'' the report said.
   Congress modified the law this year in response to the drought to
allow soybeans to be planted on corn acres in 1989 without farmers
losing future benefits under the corn program.
   ``The 1990 farm bill debate should focus on such alternatives
that retain USDA's ability to influence crop production but provide
more flexibility to respond to market opportunities,'' the report
said.
   GAO boss Charles A. Bowsher said that other concerns lawmakers
should address include:
   _Reducing the cost of Farmers Home Administration loan programs.
   _Finding long-term ways of reducing dairy surpluses.
   _Strengthening the viability of the USDA's federal crop insurance
program.
   _Enhancing U.S. agricultural competitiveness in world markets.
   _Improving the delivery of food stamp benefits to low-income
families.

   Farmers who want to participate in the
government's 1989 programs for wheat, feed grain and upland cotton
can sign up Dec. 19 through April 14 at county offices.
   The signup dates for 1989 rice and extra-long staple cotton
programs will be announced later, Agriculture Secretary Richard E.
Lyng said Monday.
   Farmers also will be able to ``declare their intentions'' from
Dec. 19 through Feb. 3 to plant 10 percent to 25 percent of each
program crop's permitted acreage to soybeans or sunflowers and still
protect the acreage base history for the program crops, Lyng said.
   In addition, the 1989 program allows a portion of a farm's
acreage base to be used for oats, with certain stipulations
affecting soybeans.
   During the signup, wheat and feed grains producers may request 40
percent _ upland cotton and rice producers 30 percent _ of their
estimated 1989 deficiency payments. These preliminary payments will
be in cash.
   Deficiency payments are direct subsidies made to farmers to help
bridge the gap between lower market prices and ``target'' prices set
for each commodity.
   For wheat and feed grains, farmers will be able to participate in
an optional acreage ``diversion'' or land-idling program called
0-92. Under it, a farmer can devote all or part of his crop's
permitted acreage to soil-conserving uses and get deficiency
payments on up to 92 percent of the land.
   Rice and upland cotton farmers will be able to participate in a
50-92 version.

   The Farmers Home Administration should allow
more time for delinquent borrowers to file replies to the agency's
demand that they come up with a plan to settle over-due accounts,
says Rep. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D.
   Dorgan said Monday that 14 members of Congress sent a letter last
week to Vance Clark, head of the FmHA, asking that the 45-day time
period be extended. Notices were sent out last week to 83,500 FmHA
borrowers who are behind in loan repayments.
   Under the rules, these will have 45 days to reply to FmHA with
information on how they intend to repay, refinance or restructure
over-due loans totaling more than $8 billion.
   FmHA spokesman Marlyn Aycock said he did not know of any plan by
the agency to extend the 45-day period. ``Not at this point,'' he
said.
   Dorgan said the notices, scheduled for mailing Nov. 14-25, put
the 45-day deadline just after the first of the year. Borrowers who
fail to respond in time, or whose proposals are rejected, face
foreclosure by FmHA, he said.
   ``These notices include over 200 pages of complex regulations,'
Dorgan said. ``I feel the farmers should be given sufficient time to
analyze the regulations and compile the necessary information to
fill out the forms correctly.''

   Carl Hubbell, one of baseball's top
pitchers in the 1930s, died Monday of head and chest injuries, two
days after being critically injured in an automobile accident. He
was 85.
   Hubbell's most celebrated feat was striking out Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig and three other future Hall of Famers in a row in the 1934
All-Star Game. He also threw a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh
Pirates in 1929. Hubbell was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1947.
   The left-hander won 253 games, including 21 or more games five
years in a row for the New York Giants. He won the Most Valuable
Player Award with a 26-6 record in 1936 and set a then-record of 46
1-3 consecutive scoreless innings from July 13 to Aug. 1, 1933.
   His major league career, all with the Giants, ran 16 years from
1928-43 when the team won three pennants and the 1933 World Series.
Hubbell later worked for the Giants as an executive and scout.

on how John F. Kennedy _ slain 25 years ago today _ had changed
their lives with his summons to serve the needy overseas.
   During a 24-hour vigil in the same great hall where the
president's body lay in state for a desolate day and night in
November 1963, about 500 volunteers paid tribute to Kennedy's memory
with brief speeches, songs and readings from their journals and
letters written from strange lands.
   Ruth Pearsall of Frankfort, Mich., led three generations of Peace
Corps volunteers in her family to take part in the vigil _ herself,
daughter Virginia Kirkwood and grandnephew Craig Hendricks.
   Helen Clarke of Honolulu and Linda Frye of Pennsburg, Pa., both
77, swapped stories about their adventures as widows embarking on
new lives in India and Venezuela in the mid-1960s.
   One of the most emotionally charged moments of the vigil came
when John F. Murphy Jr., a Hartford, Conn., lawyer, read a letter he
wrote in July 1969 to the mother of a former Peace Corps buddy who
was killed the Vietnam War.
   Murphy recalled that after he and John Morascini had built a
schoolhouse together in Gabon, in West Africa, in the early 1960s,
Morascini built a playground and planned a carnival where villagers
could celebrate.
   ``Do not remember John for the medal which they may send, or even
for the flag which they have given you,'' Murphy wrote Morascini's
mother.
   ``I will remember John as one who really did bring some peace to
the world. He brought peace not as a sergeant in the U.S. Army but
as a young boy who once had an idea that it might be a good thing to
build a playground.''
   Said Katy Hansen of Orange City, Iowa, who taught in a Nigerian
high school in 1967-68: ``We are here to rejoice in a life
well-lived, and not to mourn a life that has passed away. This is a
celebration of life.''
   Today, Ms. Hansen is president of the National Council of
Returned Peace Corps Volunteers and vice chairman of the Sioux
County Democratic Party. She says she tries to keep the Kennedy
spirit alive by helping save Iowa's family farmers from ruin.
   The vigil is ending at noon today with remarks by Sens.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., himself a former volunteer in the
Dominican Republic in 1966-68, and television commentator Bill
Moyers, the agency's first deputy director.
   A commemorative service will be held afterward at St. Matthew's
Roman Catholic Cathedral, where Kennedy's funeral service was held
on Nov. 25, 1963. Officiating will be the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh,
who was first chairman of the Peace Corps advisory committee.
   Altogether, an estimated 130,000 former volunteers and staff have
served in 95 countries since Kennedy founded the Peace Corps in
March 1961 as his first major initiative as president. Today, 6,000
volunteers are working in 65 countries, and the agency says it
expects to have 10,000 abroad by the early 1990s.
   Rep. Tom Petri, R-Wis., one of six House members who are former
volunteers, said Kennedy taught him that ``Americans should be
involved with the world, not just as diplomats or the military, but
as citizens.''
   Fresh out of law school, Petri went to Somalia in 1966 to help
the post-colonial government codify its laws. Other former
volunteers in the House are Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn.; Jim
Courter, R-N.J.; Paul Henry, R-Mich.; Tony Hall, D-Ohio, and Jim
Moody, D-Wis.

   In just two months as the first Hispanic to
serve in the Cabinet, Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos has
extended an olive branch to teacher unions and other groups that
bitterly opposed Reagan administration education policies.
   Cavazos' predecessor, William J. Bennett, often blamed those
groups for many of the troubles ailing U.S. schools.
   After President-elect George Bush announced Monday that he was
keeping Cavazos, the education secretary said, ``There is much to be
done. We will continue our thrust in the directions we've moved in
already, and we will have the clear mandate from our department to
educate every person in America to their fullest potential.''
   At his first news conference as secretary two months ago, Cavazos
said, ``I really bring no agenda other than to try to advance
education in America. We're all on the side of the angels.''
   Mary Futrell, president of the National Education Association,
hailed Bush's action.
   ``This reappointment is a hopeful sign that Mr. Bush will fulfill
his campaign promise to become `the education president,''' she
said, adding that during his two months in Reagan's Cabinet, Cavazos
has brought ``a new atmosphere of good will and cooperation that was
clearly lacking under his predecessor.''
   Some of the same qualities that have won Cavazos praise from the
NEA and other education groups have raised hackles among
conservatives who fear Cavazos is too liberal for their tastes.
   For Cavazos, 61, the son of a foreman on the King Ranch in Texas,
education has been the pathway to repeated success, first as a
physiology Ph.D. and professor, later as dean of the Tufts
University School of Medicine and, from 1980 until recently, as
president of his alma mater, Texas Tech University.
   Now he faces the challenge of trying to sustain and expand the
reform movement that has reverberated through American education
since April 1983, when a panel of Reagan administration advisers
warned of ``a rising tide of mediocrity'' engulfing U.S. schools.
   Cavazos began his own education in a one-room schoolhouse on the
800,000-acre King Ranch with other Hispanic children of ranch hands.
When he was ready to start third grade, his family moved to the town
of Kingsville, Texas, where he became the first Hispanic child to
enroll in the local school.
   His father stressed the importance of education to all his
children. One became a four-star Army general. Another won honors as
a college football running back and now owns his own ranch.
   Cavazos enlisted in the Army upon graduation from high school and
was contemplating a career as a commercial fisherman when he was
discharged. His father vetoed that idea and took him to enroll
instead at Texas Tech.
   ``I am convinced education is the key to many things,'' Cavazos
said when Reagan nominated him. ``If you have sufficient education
you can solve almost any problem in the world. Famine. Ecological
problems. Nuclear problems. Racism. They're all solved with
education.''
   He met his wife, Peggy, a registered nurse, at Texas Tech. They
married 33 years ago and have 10 children _ seven of them Texas Tech
graduates _ including a physician, an architect, a teacher and two
pilots.
   Cavazos has voted Democratic in past elections and angered some
conservatives by refusing to record a blanket endorsement ad for
Republican congressional candidates. But he did campaign across the
Southwest for Bush, who is a fellow Texan and old friend.
   Cavazos has called himself ``a very, very strong advocate of
bilingual education. But my goal is to make the person competent as
quickly as possible in English.''
   Bennett waged a successful fight to persuade Congress to allow 25
percent of bilingual education funds to be spent on English-only
immersion programs.
   Cavazos, at his initial news conference Sept. 21, offered a plea
in Spanish to the millions of children growing up, like he did,
speaking that language: ``Por favor, ninos, no dejen la escuela''
(``Please, children, don't leave school'').
   Bush said Monday he wants Cavazos to help find ways to make
college more affordable, to reward outstanding teachers, to spur
alternate certification of teachers and establish magnet and
``merit'' schools.
   Bush also said he favors vouchers and believes ``parental choice
... is the optimum thing to encourage excellence in education.''
   While Bush has promised to launch a $500 million ``merit school''
program to reward schools that achieve top results with
disadvantaged students, many other programs in the $21 billion
Education Department budget could be under pressure from Bush's
flexible freeze proposal.
   As Texas Tech president, Cavazos spoke out against Reagan efforts
to cut grants and loans for college students.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Drug To Treat Cancer Common Among AIDS Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alpha interferon, a natural disease fighter
already used to treat leukemia, can now be used to battle Kaposi's
sarcoma, a cancer that primarily attacks AIDS patients.
   The Food and Drug Administration announced Monday that alpha
interferon was shown in tests to be effective against Kaposi's and
now is approved for treatment of the cancer that has become common
among AIDS victims.
   Alpha interferon is a disease-fighter that is present in the body
naturally in small amounts, but has been artifically produced in
large quantities in recent years through the use of gene-splicing
techniques. It previously had been approved for treatment of
hairy-cell leukemia and for genital warts.
   Frank E. Young, FDA commissioner, said approval of the man-made
alpha interferon ``shows biotechnology's emerging role in helping
modern medicine fight some of the most serious diseases which plague
mankind.''
   Kaposi's sarcoma, named for a European doctor who first described
it more than 100 years ago, was a rare cancer until the appearance
early in this decade of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   The cancer causes purple or brown lesions on the skin and can
attack the lungs, brain and gastrointestinal tract. Kaposi's can
cause death when it attacks the lungs or other vital organs,
although most AIDS patients die of other causes.
   Alpha interferon was used experimentally to treat Kaposi's in a
number of studies, including some conducted at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National
Institutes of Health.
   Anthony S. Fauci, the NIAID director, said that studies by H.
Clifford Lane of the NIAID ``demonstrated that alpha interferon was
an effective anti-Kaposi's sarcoma agent'' in patients who were in
the early stages of the AIDS infection.
   According to the FDA, several human studies showed that high
doses of alpha inteferon would reduce Kaposi's tumors in 40 to 45
percent of patients who were in early stages of the AIDS infection.
   AIDS patients who were helped most were those whose blood showed
a T4-helper cell count of above 200 per square centimeter, and who
have not experienced other opportunistic infections. T4-helper cells
are part of the body's immune system and are attacked by the AIDS
virus. Healthy people have a T4-helper cell count of 800 to 1,000.
   Those with more advanced AIDS tend to have T4-helper cell counts
below 200 and do not benefit from the alpha interferon treatment.
   Alpha interferon was first identified in 1957 as a hormone-like
protein that is a natural disease-fighting component of the blood.
In the early 1980s, researchers were able to insert the gene coded
for alpha interferon into a bacteria which then produces the protein
in large quantities. This is the technique called gene-splicing.
   The FDA said that alpha interferon is marketed by Schering Corp.
of Kenilworth, N.J., under the brand name Intron-A, and by
Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley, N.J. under the brand name Roferon. Both
products were first approved in 1986 for the treatment of hairy-cell
leukemia, and last June for the treatment of genital warts.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through contact with
blood, blood products or semen from infected persons. AIDS is
incurable and fatal.
   As of Nov. 7, AIDS had been diagnosed in 77,994 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 43,888, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the government.

   An editor who was to take over leadership of
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday underwent surgery here to
remove a cancerous kidney, hospital officials said.
   Arnold Rosenfeld, 55, was in stable condition Monday night, said
a spokeswoman at Seton Medical Center.
   He was hospitalized Thursday for treatment of a suspected kidney
infection. A malignant tumor was found in the kidney, requiring its
removal, hospital spokeswoman M.A. Bengtson said.
   Doctors found no evidence the tumor had spread to other areas of
the body or to the attending blood vessels, Ms. Bengtson said.
   Rosenfeld officially became editor of the Journal-Constitution on
Monday, replacing Bill Kovach, who resigned Nov. 4 after a
disagreement with the publisher.
   Rosenfeld, who previously was editor of the Austin
American-Statesman, will probably be hospitalized about five to
eight days, with an expected recovery time of two to three weeks,
the hospital spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Attorney General To Reach Out To Civil Rights Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who has been
allaying conservative concerns over his tenure, now plans to reach
out to civil rights leaders who have been criticizing the Reagan
administration for eight years.
   After President-elect George Bush announced Monday that he
intended to retain him, Thornburgh signaled that he seeks to reopen
lines of communication to civil rights groups. Administration
relations with such groups have deteriorated because of its
opposition to affirmative action hiring and promotion, court-ordered
school desegregation and other programs.
   ``In the civil rights area, the vice president has indicated a
desire to reach out to groups that may feel disaffected from the
process,'' Thornburgh told reporters. ``I have a long history of
working effectively with leadership of the civil rights groups which
I hope to continue.''
   In the coming weeks, the attorney general will meet with the
Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a coalition of 180
organizations. Thornburgh knows the conference's executive director,
Ralph Neas, who is spending several months at Harvard University's
institute of politics which was formerly headed by Thornburgh.
   ``There's obviously some perception'' on the part of civil rights
leaders ``that we're not willing to listen and talk with and
consider their views in framing the administration's views,''
Thornburgh said, adding, ``We want to dispel that.''
   He said ``there's certainly no conscious effort to change the
basic civil rights agenda'' and he said ``we're going to disagree
... but I think the importance of the effort we're going to try to
make is to establish a dialogue.''
   Thornburgh's and the Bush administration's first important task
in the area will be to find a replacement for the Justice
Department's civil rights division chief, William Bradford Reynolds,
who spearheaded the Reagan administration's controversial policies.
   Thornburgh's overtures to the civil rights community follow three
months in which he has been watched closely by conservatives.
   ``Dick Thornburgh has been very open to conservatives, his staff
has got good lines of communications to conservative leaders on the
legal issues,'' said Dan Casey, executive director of the American
Conservative Union.
   A number of weeks ago, Casey singled out the then-imminent
question of whether Thornburgh would step into the abortion issue
before the Supreme Court as a key test of how the attorney general
would be regarded among conservative groups represented in his
organization.
   Thornburgh was deeply involved in the solicitor general's
decision to invite the Supreme Court to review the landmark ruling
legalizing abortion.
   The attorney general's track record to date has ``very much eased
conservative fears about what he might be inclined to do as attorney
general over the long haul,'' said Patrick Korten, a Justice
Department spokesman under Thornburgh's predecessor, Edwin Meese
III, and now with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
   Shortly after coming to Washington, Thornburgh had delivered a
speech on ethics at the Justice Department that was viewed as being
a thinly veiled reference to Meese, who had been under criminal
investigation for 14 months before resigning in August. Also,
Thornburgh made clear he had serious reservations about an order
Meese signed in his final day at the Justice Department setting
forth procedures under which independent counsels could be appointed
to investigate members of Congress.
   Thornburgh still has reservations about the Meese order, but now
says he wants to review the matter with the incoming Bush
administration before taking action.
   In addition, he persuaded President Reagan to announce plans to
veto a whistleblower protection bill passed by Congress and argued
before the Supreme Court in favor of a drug testing program.
   Thornburgh also defended the Justice Department's decision to
file a brief attacking independent counsel Lawrence Walsh's legal
theory in the Iran-Contra that former National Security Council aide
Oliver North obstructed Congress' foreign affairs authority.
   When it was suggested the Iran-Contra brief may have been filed
to bolster his image among conservatives, Thornburgh told reporters
``That's absolute nonsense ... Nobody's got to shore up Dick
Thornburgh's conservative credentials.''

<HEAD>Big Wheat Crops Needed To Meet All Commitments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A near-record amount of wheat will be needed to
meet all U.S. domestic and export commitments in 1988-89, despite a
sharp rise in prices from last season, says an Agriculture
Department report.
   About 2.65 billion bushels will be used, down only about 5
percent from the record use of 2.69 billion bushels in 1987-88.
   Over the entire marketing yearthat runs through next May 31,
wheat prices may average $3.55 to $3.85 per bushel, up 40 to 50
percent from the 1987-88 season.
   ``Demand should be strong, despite higher prices, because foreign
and domestic food use (of wheat) is not very price-sensitive, at
least in the short term,'' the department's Economic Research
Service said Monday in its latest outlook report.
   The price of wheat used for food in the United States ``responds
little to changes in prices because wheat represents only a small
portion of the total cost to the consumer of products made with
flour,'' the report said.
   Meanwhile, world wheat export prices continue to edge higher
because of tight supplies and relatively strong demand.
   ``While the higher prices are rationing the available wheat among
importers, export subsidies, credit availability and food aid
programs are, to some extent, softening the impact of increased
costs for countries that might otherwise have to further reduce
purchases and consumption,'' the report said.
   Even so, total world wheat trade is expected to decline in
1988-89, led by a sharp drop in imports by the Soviet Union and a
decline in wheat sold as livestock feed.

<HEAD>Bush's Budget Chief Is Veteran Of Bureacratic Battles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard G. Darman, President-elect George
Bush's choice as his budget director, is an aggressive veteran of
two decades in the bureaucratic battles of Washington who is known
more for his efficiency than his modesty.
   After Darman moved into the White House as an assistant to the
president in 1981, Jim Edwards, an old Harvard friend, told a
reporter, ``He just has a natural feeling that he's superior to most
people and deserves to be at a high policy level.''
   Few deny that Darman, 45, is bright.
   In the early days of the Reagan administration, James A. Baker
III, then White House chief of staff, said he was ``the guy, more
than anybody else, who flagged the fact that we were going to have
to come up with an additional round of cuts to handle the deficit
problem.''
   When Baker left the White House to become secretary of the
treasury, Darman went with him as deputy secretary. Now Baker is
secretary of state-designate and a key adviser to Bush on
appointments and other matters.
   It was not the first time Darman had hitched his wagon to a
rising star in the Washington firmament.
   When he first came to Washington in the Nixon administration, he
went to work for what was then the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, where he caught the eye of Secretary Elliott Richardson.
   He followed Richardson as an aide during the patrician Boston
lawyer's stints at the departments of Defense, Justice and Commerce
and in the Law of the Sea negotiations for the State Department.
   Darman grew up in the affluent Boston suburb of Wellesley, Mass.,
the son of an industrialist who owned textile mills and marketed oil
and gas in New England.
   After prep school, where he was captain of the lacrosse team as
well as editor of the literary journal, he went on to Harvard
University, Harvard Business School and Washington.
   Then followed his years in the Nixon and Ford administrations,
after which he did corporate planning with a Washington consulting
firm and taught at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
   When President Reagan was elected in 1980, Darman became a member
of the White House transition team.
   In recent remarks at a Kennedy School conference in Washington,
Darman said he thought this team worked well because it was small
and the people ``knew where they were going.''
   Of the overall Reagan transition effort, involving more than
1,500 people, he said, ``If there has been a more colossal waste,
I'm not aware of it.''
   After the transition, Darman became assistant to the president
and deputy to the chief of staff, responsible for the flow of paper
to the president's desk.
   ``He's the fourth most powerful person at the White House,''
Deputy Chief of Staff Michael K. Deaver said at the time.
   Supporters lauded him as an extraordinarily bright and diligent
organizer, but detractors accused him of boundless ambition and ego.
   Darman resigned as deputy Treasury secretary in April 1987 to
take a job with Shearson Lehman Brothers investment banking division
at a salary, with stock options, that reportedly approached $1
million annually.
   This summer, however, he joined the Bush campaign as a top
adviser and served as the Michael Dukakis stand-in during Bush's
practice sessions before his two debates with the Democratic
challenger.
   Darman is married to the former Kath Emmett, a Ph.D. who is
writing a book about Americans in Paris after World War II. They
have two children.

<HEAD>Third-Party Candidates Got Less 1 Percent of Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Third-party presidential hopefuls tallied less
than one percent of the more than 90 million votes cast in the
presidential race Nov. 8 as Republican George Bush defeated Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
   Libertarian nominee Ron Paul was the leading vote-getter among
the non-major party candidates, garnering more than four-tenths of
one percent of the votes. That is above the one-quarter of a percent
of the 1984 vote won by Libertarian candidate David Bergland.
   New Alliance candidate Leonora Fulani won more than two-tenths of
one percent, good for second place among the independent hopefuls.
   Most of the third-party candidates were on the ballot in only a
handful of states each. Only Fulani was on the ballot in all 50
states, although Paul was on the ballot in 47 states.
   The figures are based on an Associated Press canvass of all 50
states.
   In five states, final, official vote returns were available. In
39 states and the District of Columbia, final, unofficial figures
were used. These were compiled by the AP, the News Election Service
or state government officials.
   In four states _ Maine, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania _
partial returns were used for Bush, Dukakis and all the third-party
candidates on the ballot in those states. In two states _ Alabama
and Rhode Island _ partial returns were available only for Bush and
Dukakis.
   The raw vote totals for all candidates should increase slightly
when all returns are counted. That is not expected until all states
certify their votes by late December.
   The only significant change from these numbers to the complete
tabulation could come in the totals for Fulani. No vote returns for
Fulani, who is from New York, were available at all from New York
City. Returns for all candidates on the ballot were tallied for the
rest of the state, plus the major party totals in New York City.
   Alaska was the best state for Paul, who received almost 3 percent
of the votes in America's northernmost outpost. The District of
Columbia was the site of Fulani's best showing, about 1.5 percent of
the vote.
   Here are the latest national vote returns and the percentage for
each candidate. A party identification is listed for most
candidates, although many third-party candidates run under different
banners in different states.
   Bush, GOP 48,138,478 _ 53.44 percent.
   Dukakis, Dem 41,114,068 _ 45.64 percent.
   Ron Paul, Libertarian 409,412 _ 0.45 percent.
   Lenora Fulani, New Alliance 201,430 _ 0.22 percent.
   David Duke, Populist 44,135 _ 0.04 percent.
   Eugene McCarthy, Consumer 30,074 _ 0.03 percent.

   Health authorities are considering whether to
immunize all newborns or children against hepatitis B, a viral liver
disease that is spread in the same manner as AIDS and is now posing
a major health and economic threat.
   Harold Margolis, chief of the hepatitis branch at the Centers for
Disease Control, said the incidence rate of hepatitis B in the
United States is on a steep increase, with about 300,000 new cases a
year and national treatment costs now about $1 million a day.
   Margolis spoke Monday at a news conference sponsored by the
National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, a non-profit
organization that promotes disease prevention.
   Sanford F. Kuvin, an infectious disease expert who operates
clinics in the United States and Israel, said hepatitis B is ``a
national tragedy in incubation in the United States.''
   Hepatitis is a viral disease that attacks the liver, causing
jaundice, fatigue and loss of appetite. Hepatitis A is spread mostly
through food and is generally a mild disease. Hepatitis B, however,
is spread through an exchange of body fluids, usually through sexual
contact, the sharing of IV drug needles or from birthing mother to
child.
   Hepatitis B is thought to be the major cause of primary liver
cancer and is thought to cause about 5,000 deaths a year, either
directly or indirectly, in the United States, according to the
foundation.
   Margolis said that between 6 percent and 10 percent of the
hepatitis B cases become chronic, in which symptoms are very slight,
but the carrier is able to spread the disease.
   Hepatitis B has a long incubation period, several months, but the
serious effects of the disease, such as cancer or liver failure, may
not appear for decades in chronic carriers.
   There is a vaccine against hepatitis B, but its use in the United
States has been recommended only for health-care workers and those
at high risk. The vaccine can prevent the disease, but it cannot
cure it once a patient is infected. And the vaccine is expensive _
about $120 for the recommended three-shot series.
   Margolis said the Centers for Disease Control has proposed that
consideration be given to the universal use of the hepatitis B
vaccine among newborn infants or among children. But he said a
program of vaccination among the young would not have a noticable
effect on the spread of hepatitis B for 10 to 30 years.
   Kuvin said he believed the threat of the disease could be
controlled with the vaccine, but that since the innoculation became
available in 1982 it has not been widely used.
   ``Unless it becomes utilized, we are in for a serious national
tragedy,'' said Kuvin.
   The number of U.S. hepatitis B cases has increased from 200,000
in 1978 to about 300,000 in 1988, he said. On a global basis, the
problem is even more severe. There are an estimated 300 million
cases worldwide, Kuvin said, and an estimated 1.5 million of the
babies born this year will die eventually of the disease or its
complications.
   The foundation is sponsoring a two-day conference on AIDS, or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and hepatitis B.

   Authorities on Monday identified one of the
seven bodies found buried outside a boardinghouse, but the coroner
said he has not yet determined how any of the victims died.
   County coroner Charles Simmons said the body of Benjamin Fink,
60, a former resident of Dorothea Puente's Victorian boardinghouse
in downtown Sacramento, was identified through fingerprints.
   No further information was released on Fink. But Robert Fink told
reporters last week that his brother had been a chronic alcoholic
since age 17, that he spent most of his life in Sacramento on the
streets, and that he had moved into the Puente boarding house
earlier this year.
   Simmons said his office had completed autopsies on six of the
seven victims. He said the seventh autopsy would be finished on
Tuesday, but that a final report with toxicology studies would not
be completed until sometime next week.
   Simmons said despite the extreme decomposition of most of the
bodies, he obtained good fingerprints from at least three victims
and there are still ``better than 50-50 chances'' of determining the
cause of death.
   The victims have been identified as three men and three women,
with an autopsy still pending on a seventh badly decomposed body.
   Puente, 59, the landlady at the boardinghouse where the bodies
were discovered last week, remained in jail without bail on one
murder charge. Authorities said they expect to file additional
charges soon.
   Detectives say they believe Puente murdered elderly boarders and
hid their bodies in order to collect their Social Security checks.
She said in a television interview after her arrest last Wednesday
that she didn't kill anyone but admitted, ``the checks I cashed,
yes.''

<HEAD>American Psychiatrists To Inspect Soviet Institutions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen American psychiatrists will visit
Soviet mental institutions for two weeks in January to check on
allegations that political dissidents are held there for harsh
treatment as punishment for their views.
   When the psychiatrists return they will publish their findings,
and the Soviets will be permitted to send psychiatrists to the
United States for meetings with American experts on practices in
this country.
   The reciprocal agreement, announced Monday at the State
Department, appeared to represent another step to improve superpower
relations. However, the Soviet reputation in the controversial area
of psychiatry could be at stake.
   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said the
purpose of the visit, which was arranged last week in Moscow by a
visiting U.S. delegation, was ``to study and analyze the U.S.
psychiatric process.''
   He declined to say exactly how many Soviet citizens were in
institutions as punishment, but said there were ``a number of people
in that category.''
   Soviet dissident psychiatrist Anatoly Koryagin said last year he
knew of 183 political activists detained in psychiatric institutions.
   ``That is the number known to me,'' he told the American
Psychiatric Association at a meeting in Chicago. ``The total is much
larger, of course.''
   Koryagin was imprisoned for ``anti-Soviet agitation'' in 1981
after detailing numerous cases in which political dissidents were
confined in Soviet mental hospitals. After examining many, he
diagnosed them as sane.
   During his imprisonment, he was tortured, force-fed, mentally
abused and given powerful psychotropic drugs, Koryagin said.
   Koryagin, who was freed in February 1987, said there were 16 such
institutions for the criminally insane in which political dissidents
were held.
   Leading Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov, during a visit to
Washington last week, called detention in psychiatric institutions
for political purposes ``one of the most acute abuses of human
rights'' in his country.
   Sakharov said some political dissidents were detained but were
outnumbered by ``chronic complainers'' who had been sent to
institutions for habitually criticizing their supervisers.
   Redman said the American psychiatrists and other experts would be
able to examine patients and also discuss law and mental health with
Soviet authorities.
   He said the agreement anticipated ``an intensification of
professional contacts'' between American and Soviet psychiatrists.
   The spokesman said the United States was interested is discussing
with the Soviets the ``use of psychiatry as a threat or punishment
for people who we feel are actually incarcerated for political and
religious activity.''
   The Soviets had promised earlier this year to allow an American
delegation to visit their institutions. The issue is one of many
human rights concerns the Reagan administration has raised with
Moscow.

<TEXT>
   Conservatives, watching warily as their ranks
are passed by for one top-level post after another, are nonetheless
buoyed by George Bush's appointment of their philosophical soul
mates John Sununu and Lee Atwater.
   The week after the election, a virtual Who's Who of the right
beat a path to the Jackson Place brownstone housing the offices of
Dan Quayle's transition team to court what some considered their
main link in the new administration.
   But with Bush's selection of Sununu as White House chief of staff
and Atwater for stewardship of the Republican National Committee,
members of the right believe they will have more than one partisan
in the White House even as Bush turns to people known more as
pragmatists than ideologues to fill out Cabinet posts.
   ``We see Dan Quayle as a strong ally but with the moves George
Bush has been making recently the indication is that we don't need a
one-man allegiance inside the administration,'' said L. Brent Bozell
III, executive director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a
political action committee that works for conservative candidates.
   ``The choice of Sununu, the choice of Lee Atwater _ I think
George Bush is making a very strong pitch to conservatives that he
wants them active in the administration,'' he said in an interview
last week.
   Other conservatives are simply beside themselves with glee.
   ``I think it's the best chief of staff appointment in my 22 years
in Washington,'' Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress
Research and Education Foundation, said of the Sununu selection.
Weyrich's group is a conservative think-tank.
   ``Last Thursday was really neat about Sununu and Atwater,'' said
conservative activist Richard Vigurie.
   In August, conservatives hailed the selection of Quayle, the
Indiana senator who stood on the right side of such issues as
abortion, aid to the Nicaraguan rebels and school prayer.
   But some still wondered about Bush, who ran as a moderate in his
1980 bid for the presidency.
   ``I don't think Mr. Bush has completely dispelled some of the
uncertainty that has come down over the years,'' said Dr. Robert
Grant of the American Freedom Coalition, a conservative organization
that has worked for aid to the Contras. ``With some of the
conservative leaders, there's still a certain amount of reservation
there but with Quayle there is no hesitancy ... because he has a
track record.''
   Conscious of Quayle's background, conservatives sought him out in
the days after the election.
   On a single day, the vice president-elect's schedule included a
breakfast meeting with columnist William Safire, lunch with former
United Nations ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and an afternoon
discussion with Ed Feulner, president of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think-tank.
   The wooing of one of their own made perfect sense to
conservatives who scoff at questions about Quayle's academic
background and military career that have dogged him since his
selection at the Republican National Convention.
   ``He's been an ally and a friend for many years and it's a
logical channel for conservatives to this administration because we
don't have to teach him the philosophy,'' Weyrich said. ``I think
he's gotten a very bad rap in this campaign _ he's a lot brighter
and more able than I think he was pictured to be.''
   Concerns that Bush will return to his moderate leanings have
forced conservatives to act, Grant said. ``The way to avert that
concern is to push your agenda and find people who will underscore
that agenda.''
   But former President Richard M. Nixon, who met with Quayle on
Monday, cautioned the vice president-elect against becoming the
conservative voice in the administration.
   ``I would not want to have Senator Quayle, who is a conservative,
to simply be a so-called house conservative. That doesn't serve his
interest,'' Nixon said. ``I urged him _ and he agrees _ that he
should reach out, not only to conservatives, listen to them, but
others within the party, and in the Democratic Party as well.''
   Self-interest is not the only reason conservatives are seeking
out Quayle. Some worry about the role their ally will play in the
Bush administration.
   ``I think what you're seeing from these conservatives is a move
to bolster Dan Quayle and show solidarity with the man,'' said
Bozell.
   ``I just don't think that conservatives want to see Dan Quayle
put in a back office somewhere, in the proverbial windowless office
of the administration,'' he said. ``They want to see him active out
there and I think that's going to happen.''
   But Donald Devine of the American Conservative Union, a
legislative interest organization, believes that Quayle shouldn't
rush into a high-profile role.
   ``The most important thing for Dan Quayle is that he takes his
time, learns the job and solidifies his reputation. He shouldn't be
in a hurry,'' said Devine, who served as President Reagan's director
of the Office of Personnel Management from 1981 to 1985.
   As for a conservative link in the administration, the selection
of Sununu and Atwater indicates that Quayle is not the only liaison,
according to Devine.
   ``I would say he is a link to the administration but ... I think
George Bush is going to be a good link,'' he said.

<HEAD>Advise To Bush: Close Insolvent S&Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former presidents and a congressional
agency are calling on the next president to stop rescuing insolvent
savings institutions and start closing them down.
   ``The current approach of merging or selling insolvent
institutions ... defers but does not solve the problem,'' former
presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter said Monday in a report to
President-elect George Bush. They recommended closing all insolvent
S&Ls within two years.
   The General Accounting Office, in one of a series of transition
reports addressed to the next administration and Congress, made a
more urgent appeal: ``The time has come to move as quickly as
possible to close insolvent institutions.''
   Nearly 500 of the nation's 3,000 S&Ls are insolvent. Another 400
don't meet federal capital standards and are considered weak.
Estimates of the cost of cleaning up the mess range from $50 billion
to $100 billion.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has ``resolved'' 146 cases so
far this year, but only 26 of them by closing the institution. Most
of the rest have been rescued. The government has provided cash and
guarantees against future loss to entice private investors and
healthy S&Ls into taking over failed institutions.
   GAO analyst Craig Simmons said his agency was not against all
mergers, but said so far the bank board hasn't had the money to
recognize all the losses and is covering them with open-ended
guarantees.
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, defended the current
practice. He said selling too much of the property from failed S&Ls
too fast could drag down the value of property held by healthy
institutions, further debilitating economically troubled regions.
   ``It would be devastating if we were to do wholesale liquidations
in a state like Texas,'' he said, adding, ``There are places in the
country where wholesale closings would result in no services to a
community.''
   However, the GAO argued that keeping failed S&Ls open has in the
past ``simply delayed the inevitable while adding to the eventual
costs.''
   But, it said, closing insolvent thrifts ``means fully recognizing
and finding the money to pay for the losses in those institutions _
money that FSLIC (the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.) does
not have today.''
   It said the problem was too large for the industry to bear alone
and said the ``depositing public'' must help, either through an
appropriation of tax dollars or some sort of user charge.
   The two former presidents said the industry must continue to pay
for the cleanup of ailing institutions, but they acknowledged, ``the
next president and Congress (also) must go to the taxpayers.''
   Delay is dangerous, the former presidents said, because ``a
sudden development or unexpected crisis _ such as a stock market
crash or an increase in interest or inflation rates _ could trigger
a wholesale flight of depositors.''
   ``The effect on the U.S. economy and on the world economy could
be devastating,'' they said.
   In recommendations to avoid a repeat of the problem, Carter and
Ford said the FSLIC should be administratively merged with the fund
for commercial banks under a common regulatory board, a move opposed
by the S&L industry.
   The GAO called for ``fundamental changes'' in the regulation of
S&Ls, citing ``the schizophrenic position of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board as both an industry advocate and safety and soundness
regulator.''
   It recommend consideration of merging the commercial bank and S&L
regulatory systems, but did not endorse the idea.
   Simmons said the GAO believed a sweeping reform of deposit
insurance, which guarantees accounts in banks and S&Ls up to
$100,000, was not needed immediately and could delay the resolution
of the crisis. Instead, the agency suggested experimenting with
several reforms.
   One, called risk-based deposit insurance, would charge higher
premiums to banks that make risky investments. Another, known as a
narrow bank proposal, would restrict S&Ls to investing deposits in
nearly risk-free areas such as government securities.

<HEAD>Reagan Breaks Ground on Presidential Library</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the twilight of his presidency,
Ronald Reagan stood on the hilltop site of his future presidential
library and spoke in solemn tones about how future generations will
study the conservative tide he ushered in.
   ``The journey has not been just my own,'' Reagan said Monday.
``It seems I have been guided by a force much larger than myself, a
force made up of ideas and beliefs about what this country is and
what it could be.''
   The president and his wife Nancy gathered with close friends to
break ground on what will be the $40 million home for the largest
accumulation of papers and memorabilia for any president.
   Former Cabinet members William Clark, Ed Meese and William French
Smith, industrialist Armand Hammer, MCA chief Lew Wasserman and
actor Charlton Heston shared the moment with a beaming Reagan.
   ``This is a most humbling moment for me,'' said Reagan, who will
relinquish the presidency to George Bush on Jan. 20. ``The story
that will be told inside the walls that are yet to be built here is
the story not only of a presidency, but of a movement.''
   After his six-minute speech, the president was given a
chrome-plated shovel and quickly dug up three heaping mounds of dirt
in the ground-breaking ceremony. The first lady, however, struggled
with her shovel in the hard soil and wobbled while trying to scoop
it.
   The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, which will be the
repository for an expected 62 million papers, exceeding Richard
Nixon's record 44 million, will occupy a 153,000-square-foot,
Spanish-style building in Ventura County's Tierra Rejada Valley, 45
miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The selection of the Simi Valley site, about 70 miles southeast
of the Reagans' ranch in Santa Barbara County, came after planners
of the Reagan library were thwarted in an attempt to build it at
Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
   Appearing at the ceremony at the start of a six-day Thanksgiving
vacation at his ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains, Reagan talked
reflectively of his eight years as president.
   The Reagan imprint was based on a fiscal policy aimed at
stimulating economic growth through tax cuts and deregulation of
business, along with a resurgence of U.S. international influence
brought about principally by a major military buildup, projections
of American power in the Third World and warming, if unsteady,
relations with the Soviet Union.
   ``What this library will house is the record of ideas and
policies that have undergirded our accomplishments,'' Reagan said.
``There will be much to study here, much to discuss, much to mull
over.''
   ``This library will allow scholars of the future to cast their
own judgments on these years, and I would not presume to predict the
result of their researches,'' he said. ``But I have to believe that
scholars of good will, upon examining the historical record that
will be contained herein, will judge our efforts well.''
   ``But as for us, at present we can only say this: We have done
our best and we pray that it has been enough.''
   The land for the library was donated by a Los Angeles development
company, Blakeley-Schwartz. The selection sparked opposition by
environmentalists initially because the site impinged on a greenbelt
area protected from large-scale development by a decade-old,
non-binding agreement among the communities of Simi Valley, Moorpark
and Thousand Oaks.
   The library will be built from donations to the private Ronald
Reagan library foundation. It will sit in an area of rolling hills
covered with brush, beavertail cactus and wildflowers.
   The building will include underground storage, a museum, and
research materials depicting the administration and historical
events during the Reagan years.

   Police say they have arrested a man they
identified as the last of eight IRA members still at large after a
1981 escape from a Northern Ireland courthouse.
   Police said Gerard Michael Sloan, 35, of Belfast, Northern
Ireland, was arrested Monday at Dublin Airport, where he was about
to board an airliner. He was traveling under an assumed name and had
a ticket to Toronto, police said.
   Six other members of the outlawed Irish Republican Army,
including Sloan's brother Anthony, were recaptured in the republic
five years ago and were imprisoned in Portloaise jail. They were
sentenced under laws permitting guerrilla suspects to be tried in
the jurisdiction of their arrest, regardless of where their alleged
crimes were committed.
   The laws have been used to overcome difficulties in extraditing
IRA suspects from the republic to Britain. The IRA, fighting to
drive the British out of predominantly Northern Ireland, wants to
unite the British province with the Roman Catholic republic.
   The seventh man among the escapees, Joseph Doherty, was arrested
by the FBI in New York in 1983 and has since been resisting
extradition to Northern Ireland from his cell in the Manhattan
Correctional Center.
   The eight escaped after being convicted of trying to murder Capt.
Herbert Westmacott of Britain's undercover Special Air Services in
Belfast. Gerard Sloan got 18 years for his part and for arms
possession.

<HEAD>Top Soviet Space Researcher Says Shuttles Are Costly Mistakes
^Eds: Roald 2nd graf cq.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN-CLAUDE BOUIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The recently resigned head of Soviet space
research says his country's maiden space shuttle launch had
``absolutely no scientific value,'' and the U.S. and Soviet shuttle
programs are in ``deep trouble'' economically.
   Roald Z. Sagdeev, who headed the Soviet Space Research Institute
for 15 years, said last week's inaugural Soviet shuttle flight _
like the 1981 flight of the first U.S. shuttle _ was an
``outstanding technological achievement.''
   The shuttle, however, ``is technology of the 21st century. Why
should we pay 20th century money for it?''
   ``My personal view is that American experience with the shuttle
indicates that from the point of view of cost efficiency, the
shuttle is in deep trouble,'' said Sagdeev, who has followed closely
the U.S. decision-making process on the shuttle and is a key science
and arms control adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``It is much simpler and cheaper to fly a payload with any kind
of expendable vehicle.''
   Sagdeev, like many American scientists, fears the costly shuttles
are drawing away much needed funds from basic science, and that
manned flight is unnecessary for most research.
   ``It went up. It came down. But it had absolutely no scientific
value,'' was Sagdeev's blunt assessment of the 3{-hour, unmanned
orbital flight a week ago today of the Soviet shuttle that ended the
U.S. monopoly on reusable spacecraft.
   In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, the
55-year-old physicist confirmed he voluntarily left the top post at
the agency that handles space exploration and astronomy because he
felt no one person should dominate an institute for such a long time.
   Sagdeev, a longtime member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences,
said he would concentrate on his own research and the think tank he
heads that advises Gorbachev on arms control.
   The space institute's 1,500 researchers chose by popular vote its
new director, Albert Galeev, 48, also a physicist who was a student
of Sagdeev at Novosibirsk University.
   ``He is not just fresh blood, but an administrator as well as a
scientist and he knows rules of the game between creative scientists
and bureaucrats,'' Sagdeev said in the interview partly in English
and in Russian with the help of an American translator.
   Sagdeev, who specialized in space and plasma physics research,
said Soviet science has contributed too little to the world's stock
of scientific knowledge mainly because of its bureaucratic structure.
   In a speech last month in Moscow during elections at the Academy
of Sciences, whose members include about 400 top scientists in all
fields, he said the Soviet space program could lose its edge because
it rewards bureaucracy rather than scientific merit.
   In nominating human-rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov to the
academy's board of directors, Sagdeev also said the election offered
a chance for the academy to make up for failing to elevate some
leading space and nuclear researchers to top positions in past
decades.
   Sagdeev declined to discuss technical details of the Soviet
shuttle Buran, Russian for snowstorm or blizzard, or the goals of
the program, saying he had not been directly involved in its
development.
   He said he was not impressed with the sophisticated computer
flight program that allowed the shuttle to maneuver and land by
remote control and which the Soviets say will give cosmonauts more
time for scientific research.
   ``We had quite a few more years to come up with a shuttle and
probably the Americans would produce now something much more
sophisticated'' than the existing U.S. shuttle design, he said.
   The Soviets have made public few details about the Buran, a
lookalike of the U.S. shuttle. State-run media have only indirectly
indicated that its cost is similar to the U.S. program, or about $10
billion.
   Sagdeev said shuttle technology won't make up within this century
the huge difference in cost between expendable rockets and reusable
shuttles.
   Safety measures taken after the U.S. shuttle Challenger disaster
will add to the costs, he said. And National Aeronautics and Space
Administation officials, who initially had hoped to have up to 40
shuttle launches a year, have had to scale back plans to about one a
month, greatly reducing the program's economical efficiency.
   The Soviets repeatedly have said the U.S. shuttle was wasteful
and unreliable, and have criticized its military uses. The Pentagon,
however, says that the Soviet spacecraft could be used to deploy
killer satellites and nuclear missile defense weapons.
   The next U.S. shuttle flight, with Atlantis, is to carry five
military astronauts on a secret Defense Department mission Dec. 1
that reportedly will deploy a satellite to spy on the Soviet Union.
The Soviets, who say they plan up to four flights per year, have not
announced another mission.
   Asked why the Soviets were engaged in a shuttle program, Sagdeev
said, ``A lot of things are done on the basis of old stereotypes
just by copying each other.''
   Sagdeev was in New York to sign a major book contract for his
memoirs and took part along with Sakharov in board meetings and
fund-raising efforts of the Soviet Foundation for the Survival and
Development of Humanity. The Moscow-based foundation accepts no
government funds and is directed by a 30-member board of prominent
Americans and Soviets, including Sakharov and Sagdeev.

   ``Coming to America'' starring Eddie Murphy
was a box-office comedy smash, but humorist Art Buchwald isn't
laughing about the movie he says was his idea. He's suing _ for $5
million.
   ``I'm not quitting,'' the columnist vowed in telephone interview
from Washington on Monday after his lawyer filed the lawsuit against
Paramount Studios in Los Angeles Superior Court.
   Murphy's manager says his client, who isn't a defendant in the
lawsuit, wrote the script. Paramount refused to comment.
   Buchwald, whose lawsuit is the second to dispute the movie's
origin, says his story, ``King For A Day,'' was the inspiration for
the script. The movie is a fable about an African prince who lands
in New York, works in a fast-food restaurant and finds a wife.
   ``King for a Day'' tells of an oil-rich country's king who comes
to Washington, loses his power in a coup while absent, winds up
living in a ghetto where he works for a caterer and pursues a woman
who works for the State Department.
   Asked whether the dispute has soured him on writing for the
movies, Buchwald replied, ``If I win I won't be soured. If I lose,
I'll be very sour.''
   In another interview, the lampooner of Washington's foibles and
follies deadpanned that he would be willing to accept $40 million as
his rightful share of the movie's gross, which his suit predicts
will hit $250 million.
   ``It's not only the biggest hit of the year; it will probably be
the biggest hit of the decade,'' said Buchwald's attorney, Pierce
O'Donnell.
   ``Coming to America'' was greeted with mixed reviews, but
collected huge box-office receipts last summer. It trailed Disney's
hit, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' which has taken in more than $147
million at the box office.
   According to the trade newspaper Daily Variety, ``Coming to
America'' has grossed more than $120 million so far.
   Buchwald said he sold Paramount the option on his eight-page
story outline in 1983, which was snapped up as a potential vehicle
for Murphy. But he says his project was dropped and he was never
paid.
   ``I've written seven to 10 treatments before, and I've always
gotten paid,'' he said.
   But Buchwald said Paramount told him in January 1985 that the
studio no longer was interested in ``King For A Day.''
   Buchwald said he then sold the idea to Warner Bros., which
notified him this year that it was dropping the project because
Murphy had a similar movie ready for release.
   Buchwald's lawsuit claims breach of contract by Paramount rather
than copyright infringement, normally the basis of such actions. The
lawsuit seeks $5 million in compensatory damages plus unspecified
punitive damages.
   O'Donnell contends that Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim are
entitled to shares of the lucrative film because they brought the
idea to Paramount.
   Murphy's manager, Bob Wachs, said, ``Eddie Murphy wrote the story
100 per cent. There are many suits on `Coming to America.' Mr.
Buchwald is one of the last to file.''
   ``We have no gripe with Murphy,'' said O'Donnell. ``Our contract
was with Paramount, and for once the lawyers wrote a clear
document.''
   Under the contract appended to the lawsuit, Buchwald was to
receive $65,000 and 1.5 percent of net profits if a movie were
produced from his idea. Bernheim was to receive $235,000 plus 17.5
percent of profits as producer.
   The other lawsuit involving ``Coming to America'' was filed
against Paramount and two writers in federal court by Shelby M.
Gregory. Gregory, 38, of Hollywood, is seeking $10 million,
contending the movie was based on his completed story, ``Toto, the
African Prince.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called early Tuesday
for unity and healing after his Conservatives won the House of
Commons majority needed to assure passage of a pact lifting all
barriers on trade with the United States.
   ``Canadians have ... indicated the road they wish to follow,'' he
told a rally in his hometown of Baie-Comeau, Quebec, after Monday's
vote ended a bitterly contested 51-day campaign dominated by the
trade issue. ``We will proceed to bring greater unity, harmony and
prosperity to Canada.''
   The 49-year-old prime minister, who won a second straight term,
said in the nationally broadcast speech that ``now it is a time for
healing in the land.''
   He spoke of creating ``not just more prosperity, but more
opportunity and security for all Canadians.''
   No party had won two successive majorities in Canada since 1953.
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. projected the House of Commons
would have 169 seats for Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party,
21 more than needed for a majority in the 295-seat chamber.
   It projected John Turner's opposition Liberals, who fiercely
attacked the trade pact, would win 81 seats and the socialist New
Democratic Party of Ed Broadbent, which also opposed the accord,
would take 45 seats.
   Turner said early Tuesday he had phoned Mulroney to assure him of
cooperation.
   Speaking to a rally in his home district in Vancouver, British
Columbia, he said he had no regrets for staging the campaign ``to
promote my vision of a strong, independent and sovereign Canada, a
Canada in charge of our own destiny.''
   Turnout was about 75 percent of the nation's 17.5 million voters.
   The Canadian Press news agency said its breakdown of the popular
vote with 95.2 percent tabulated showed the Conservatives with 43.3
percent, down 7 percentage points from 1984; the Liberals with 32.4
percent, up 5 percentage points, and the New Democrats in third with
19.7 percent.
   Canadian Press said the Conservatives had 5.4 million votes, the
Liberals had 4.05 million and the New Democrats had 2.4 million.
   The Conservatives had a jittery start in the four Atlantic
Maritime provinces, but did well enough in central Quebec and
Ontario to get at least the 148 seats necessary for a majority, the
CBC said.
   Ontario Prime Minister David Peterson, a Liberal who was one of
the most prominent foes of the free trade agreement, said in a CBC
interview that he couldn't explain why the province did not come
through with the expected strong support for his party to halt the
deal.
   ``I respect the voice of the people of Canada who speak on an
issue,'' he said. ``I guess only history will say who is right and
who was wrong.''
   President Reagan and Mulroney signed the free trade agreement
Jan. 2 and Mulroney needed a majority in the Commons to have it
ratified. The U.S. Congress has already approved the pact.
   The plan is to take effect Jan. 1 and phase out remaining tariffs
over the next 10 years between Canada and the United States, whose
two-way trade is worth $150 billion a year.
   Mulroney was buoyed in the last days by polls that showed his
party back in the lead with a chance at a majority. He told
reporters he would convene Parliament quickly to act on the trade
deal.
   He led the Conservatives to a smashing victory in 1984 that gave
them 210 of the 282 seats.
   Turner used a weekend rally to repeat his plea that voters ``keep
Canada Canadian for Canadians'' and kill the agreement by voting for
his party.
   Mulroney spent the last campaign weekend in his native Quebec,
the huge French-speaking province that has 75 of the 295 seats in
the Commons. Turner hoped for a big score in the 99 seats of
Ontario, a predominantly English-speaking province where opposition
to the agreement was strongest.
   Quebec and Ontario are home to the majority of Canada's 26
million people.
   Although the Liberals were far behind when the campaign began
Oct. 1, Turner revived their prospects with relentless attacks on
the free trade agreement as a sellout of Canada.
   Mulroney says the deal guarantees future Canadian prosperity by
assuring access to the U.S. market.
   In an interview with Maclean's, the Canadian news weekly,
Mulroney said: ``The trade deal is a must for Canada's future. It's
a visionary instrument of job creation and new wealth and it is
clearly something that is on the right side of history.''
   Turner calls the agreement ``a bad deal for Canada.'' He told
Maclean's it ``would radically change the direction of our country.
It yields the economic levers of sovereignty: our energy, our
investment policy, our capital markets, supply-management of
agriculture.''
   Conservatives also reminded voters of Canada's general prosperity
during the past four years. Mulroney says 1.3 million jobs were
created.

the index closed at 29,284.26 points.
   The dollar slumped at the opening of trading due mainly to the
absence of joint central bank intervention during the previous
session, according to dealers. They also cited recent remarks by
President-elect George Bush ruling out tax hikes to narrow the U.S.
federal budget deficit.
   Market sources said the Bank of Japan entered the market to buy
dollars Tuesday when the dollar fell to around 121.60 yen.
   ``It's not dollar-selling that's pushing the currency down
further at the moment, but rather that nobody wants to keep many
dollars around prior to a holiday,'' said a dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Market participants were inclined to sell the dollar ahead of the
Labor Thanksgiving Day national holiday on Wednesday, when currency
and stock markets will be closed, he said. The dealer also said many
others were sitting on the sidelines in expectation of further
intervention by the central bank.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday morning that Japan
was willing to take measures to save the U.S. currency. But he
indicated he was not overly concerned about the dollar's fall to the
upper 121.00-yen level.
   Miyazawa also said the dollar's slide following the U.S.
presidential election on Nov. 8 stemmed from speculation that has
ignored basic economic fundamentals between the United States and
Japan.

<HEAD>Chun Faces Subpoena On Uprising, To Apologize To Nation</HEAD>

   A National Assembly committee probing
the bloody military suppression of the 1980 Kwangju uprising voted
today to subpoena former President Chun Doo-hwan to explain his role
in the incident.
   The subpeona came a day before aides say Chun, in a last ditch
attempt to calm growing public anger, will apologize on national
television for corruption and abuses of power during his rule.
   Opposition lawmakers on the National Assembly committee ignored
pleas from government members to wait until Chun speaks to the
nation before deciding whether to proceed with a subpoena.
   The committee voted 16-12 to subpoena the former president, with
members of the governing Democratic Justice Party voting against.
   Opposition groups and many ordinary Koreans have been demanding
Chun be investigated and punished for alleged corruption and
wholesale violation of human rights. Radical groups demanding Chun's
arrest have staged a series of violent demonstrations.
   According to his aides, Chun will apologize on national
television Wednesday for corruption by some of his relatives and
associates and human rights abuses during his seven-year term that
ended in February.
   The former general, who took power with military backing in 1980,
is also to announce he will turn over most of his wealth to the
government and accept rural banishment to atone for abuses under his
rule.
   Plans for Chun to make his statement Monday or today were delayed
by problems finding a safe haven where he would be secure from
attacks by radical students and other opponents, aides said.
   Chun denies any personal wrongdoing, but some of his relatives
and associates have been convicted or charged with embezzling public
funds and peddling government influence.
   President Roh Tae-woo, another former general and associate of
Chun, is trying to defuse the crisis without damaging his
government's position.
   Roh, who won a plurality but not a majority in December
presidential elections as two other candidates split the opposition
vote, must somehow satisfy public indignation against Chun while
distancing his government and party from the past abuses.
   Roh indicated he is considering pardoning Chun after the former
leader makes a public apology, according to South Korean press
reports. But governing party officials indicate they will initiate a
probe against Chun if the apology fails to quiet public anger.
   The National Assembly subcommittee probing the incident in the
southern city of Kwangju decided to go ahead and subpoena Chun after
he refused to answer requests earlier this year to appear before the
panel.
   Chun was a senior general and in effective control of the
government when troops killed some 200 people putting down an
uprising by citizens and students in Kwangju. Dissident groups claim
up to 2,000 people were killed.
   The committee said it expected to issue subpoenas in the next few
days and officials indicated Chun would be summoned in early
December. The ex-president would face prosecution if he did not obey
the subpoena.
   South Korean newspapers speculated today that Chun will apologize
for the handling of the Kwangju incident in his address to the
nation.

<HEAD>Authorities: Mafia Power Vaccuum From Convictions Will Be Filled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   On the streets of south Philadelphia, home to
many of the area's Mafia members, few believe the racketeering
conviction of mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and 16
associates means the end of organized crime.
   ``The convictions aren't gonna change anything,'' said Dino
Crimi, whose cousin, Salvatore Scafidi, was one of the 17 convicted
Saturday after a two-month trial. ``In fact, it should get worse.
Now it's all open territory out here.''
   Scarfo and his associates were convicted on all charges in a
racketeering conspiracy that included nine murders, four attempted
murders, drug dealing, loan-sharking and illegal gambling.
   All face possible sentences of 40 to 55 years in prison. Scarfo
is already serving a 14-year sentence for a 1987 extortion and
conspiracy conviction.
   Scarfo, whom the government called ``a paranoid, cold-blooded
killer,'' seized control of the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey mob
after the murders of his predecessors.
   Former boss Angelo Bruno was shot in the head in 1980 as he sat
in a car outside his south Philadelphia home. His successor, Philip
``Chicken Man'' Testa, was killed less than a year later when a
remote-controlled bomb packed with nails exploded when he opened his
front door.
   Scarfo continued the murders to eliminate enemies and consolidate
power, according to prosecutors.
   Capt. Frank Friel, head of the police department's
organized-crime unit, believes the mob has learned its lesson and
won't put a killer in charge again. He sees a local leader emerging
in the mold of Bruno.
   ``They'll get a low-profile businessman,'' Friel said.
   Joel Friedman, chief of the U.S. Justice Department's Organized
Crime Strike Force in Philadelphia, said the mob was crippled but
will not disappear as long as there is money to be made through drug
trafficking, loan sharking, extortion and gambling.
   Nevertheless, the conviction of the mob's key figures has
``shifted the equilibrium in the public's favor'' and police will
maintain the pressure to diminish mob influence, he said.
   ``With one conviction, we were able to take the guts out (of the
mob),'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Louis Pichini, who headed the
five-member prosecution team. ``It broke the myth of the Mafia's
invincibility.''
   Friedman said he expects other gangsters to fill the leadership
vacuum.
   Some predict mobsters from New York, particularly the Gambino
family, will try to take over in Atlantic City, N.J., where Scarfo
lived.
   An FBI agent quoted anonymously by the Philadelphia Daily News
speculated that reputed Gambino family head John Gotti will take
control, possibly even with Scarfo's approval, because the two were
friendly in recent years.
   Officials agree that with or without Scarfo's blessing, someone
eventually will fill the void to control the millions generated by
the area's illegal enterprises.
   ``Even though all the bosses have been in jail (awaiting trial),
the numbers game has been going on and so has the loansharking,''
the agent said. ``We have seen signs that they're becoming more
involved in methamphetamine. We expect that to continue under a
caretaker or somebody coming in from the outside.''

   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, indicted with his wife
in the Wedtech scandal two weeks after his re-election to a sixth
term, vowed to fight the corruption charges ``with all of my
God-given strength.''
   The indictments against the 55-year-old Democrat and his wife,
Jamie Lee Garcia, 48, were issued three days after Rep. Mario
Biaggi, D-N.Y., was sentenced to eight years in prison for extorting
cash and stock valued at up to $3 million from the Wedtech Corp.
   At least 19 people, including former White House aide Lyn
Nofziger, have been convicted in the case. Nofziger was found guilty
of illegal lobbying.
   In Monday's federal grand jury indictments, the Garcias were
accused of extorting $76,000 from Wedtech plus a $20,000
interest-free loan from one-time Wedtech vice chairman Mario Moreno
in exchange for obtaining ``favorable, lucrative defense contracts
for Wedtech,'' said James Fox, head of the FBI office here.
   They also were accused of taking $77,500 and a diamond and
emerald necklace from Wedtech founder John Mariotta and his wife,
Jennie, in 1985.
   Wedtech was a tiny machine shop in Garcia's South Bronx
congressional district that became a huge defense contractor through
a Small Business Administration program that allowed minority-owned
firms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding.
   But allegations of bribery, influence-peddling and other
wrongdoing enmeshed Wedtech in a series of federal and state
investigations that forced it into bankruptcy proceedings in
December 1986.
   ``I maintain my innocence and that of my wife and pledge to fight
this case with all of my God-given strength,' said Garcia, a
two-time Bronze Star winner in the Korean War who in 1978 became the
second person of Puerto Rican ancestry to be elected to the House of
Representatives.
   ``My brush with the criminal justice system has left me deeply
shaken as I have observed the government harass and intimidate my
staff, colleagues, friends and family to induce them to say
something negative about me while virtually ignoring polygraph
evidence demonstrating my innocence and all other exculpatory
information and testimony,'' Garcia said in a statement issued
through a spokesman, Bill Danvers.
   The statement also said: ``I note that despite an investigation
which has lasted nearly two years and has scrutinized virtually
every facet of my personal and professional life, the charges deal
only with the preposterous allegations of Mario Moreno, one of the
most notorious felons of the 20th century.''
   Moreno was one of four Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty to
bribing government officials and cooperated with prosecutors in
earlier Wedtech cases.
   Moreno testified earlier this year at Biaggi's trial that the
company had paid $80,000 to Garcia. The payments, for ``political
favors and political introductions'' were made to Garcia ``because
he and his wife requested it,'' said Moreno.
   Moreno also testified about numerous alleged payoffs to bankers,
businessmen, union officials and a local public utility manager.
   Also named in Monday's federal indictment was Attorney Ralph
Vallone Jr., 41, of Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was accused of
funneling $86,100 in Wedtech payments through his law office to Mrs.
Garcia as ``consulting fees,'' passing on $76,000, and keeping
$10,100 for himself.
   Vallone's attorney, Hal Meyerson, said his client was innocent
and the payments were legal, with Vallone being paid for legal
services and Mrs. Garcia being paid for public relations work.
   The indictment did not say what Garcia did in return for the
payments and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani would not elaborate.
   None of the payments, the loan or the jewelry Garcia is accused
of taking was reported on his congressional financial disclosure
forms in 1984 and 1985, according to the seven-count indictment.
   Vallone and the Garcias each face a maximum penalty of up to 20
years in prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted of extortion, the
most serious charge. They all face maximum penalties of between two
and 15 years in prison on additional charges of conspiracy, bribe
receiving and receipt of an illegal gratuity.
   They are to be arraigned on the indictment Dec. 1 in U.S.
District Court.

   The high school ring was torn from the Navy
flier's hand in the final moments of his life on Memorial Day 1944,
lost on a mountaintop in a jumble of debris from the collision of a
B-24 bomber and a fighter plane.
   The ring belonging to Clinton Baker, St. Cloud (Minn.) Technical
High School, Class of 1942, lay undiscovered on Palomar Mountain in
northern San Diego County for 44 years.
   One week ago, a hiker pulled it from the dirt and, thanks to the
determined efforts of his stepfather, helped to rekindle memories of
a long-dead brother and friend a half a continent away.
   ``A real shocker,'' said the dead flier's 54-year-old brother,
Larry Baker, of his reaction to the discovery. ``These are things
you try to put behind you.
   ``It's like bringing back a book that's been on the shelf and
getting dusty,'' Baker of Burnsville, Minn., said Monday in a
telephone interview. Clinton Baker, who died at age 21, was a star
athlete, a patriot, a ``leader,'' his brother said.
   Twelve men died in the May 30, 1944, collision between the B-24
Liberator bomber and the fighter plane, both part of a Navy night
patrol, according to records of the Stearns County (Minn.)
Historical Society.
   Rob Young, 25, was exploring the crash site Nov. 13 when he found
the ring buried under a log. He showed it to his stepfather, Ray
Wilson of Lakeside, who said he recalled thinking, ``There's
somebody who'd dearly love to have that back.''
   Wilson, 54, began a round of calls to the military and media in
an effort to pinpoint the crash date and get a list of victims.
   ``There's just something that drove me,'' said Wilson. ``I had to
find out who it belonged to. It (the ring) would sit next to my
computer and just haunt me. I just had to keep calling.''
   Reporter John Hughes of the St. Cloud Times, contacted by Wilson,
learned from residents of Baker's wartime death in San Diego. Hughes
confirmed details of the event with Bob Lommel, assistant archivist
of the Stearns County Historical Society, and then helped Wilson get
in touch with Larry Baker.
   ``It's almost more emotional now,'' Baker said of his brother's
death. ``I was always the kid brother who tagged along. He took me
everywhere, to the swimming hole and dates and everything else.''
   Jeanne Tweedy, also a 1942 St. Cloud Tech graduate, told the St.
Cloud Times that Baker ``would have to be called one of the class
leaders. You had to like him.''
   The 6-foot-2, 230-pound Baker was an all-league football player
in high school and gained all-state mention as a tackle, records
show. He also got a letter in track. He played football at the
University of Minnesota under coach Bud Wilkinson for three months
before enlisting in November 1942.
   ``He was going to win the war single-handedly,'' his brother
recalled. ``He was very patriotic.''
   Clinton was trained as an aviation machinist and aerial gunner.
He visited home in November 1943 on an eight-day furlough. His last
letter was received by his family two days before his death.
   ``He said he wanted me to do better, to be something. He had
great plans for me,'' said Larry Baker.
   When the family received Clinton's personal belongings after the
crash, they noticed his high school ring was missing.
   ``Our parents were very proud that their three sons would
graduate from high school,'' Larry Baker said. ``That was the symbol
of achievement. They'd done without to get us those rings.''
   In 1947, Larry, his brother Harold and their mother, Blanche
Baker, traveled to California to view the crash site. The earth was
still scorched, Larry said.
   Harold and Blanche Baker have since died. William Baker,
Clinton's father, died in 1942.
   Ray Wilson, who carefully polished the ring, said he intends to
fly to Minnesota next week to return it to Larry Baker. And Baker
knows where the keepsake will go: to his 21-year-old son, Clinton,
named in honor of his late uncle.
   ``It will be his,'' Baker said.

   On the night prosecutors say Joel Steinberg
fatally beat his 6-year-old daughter, Lisa, his live-in companion
said she heard noises from a bedroom in their apartment ``like Joel
throwing Lisa,'' sources say.
   Steinberg, on trial for murder in the girl's death, was angry the
night of Nov. 1, 1987, because he wanted Lisa to drink more water
and had given her and companion Hedda Nussbaum hot peppers to make
them thirstier, Nussbaum reportedly told a psychiatrist at Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center on Nov. 20.
   A copy of the unidentified psychiatrist's report was obtained by
WCBS-TV, which reported it Monday. The Associated Press confirmed
the report's contents through sources close to the case who spoke on
condition they were not identified.
   The report quoted Nussbaum as saying that Lisa asked, ``Will
daddy still take me out with him?'' Nussbaum said she responded,
``Go ask him.''
   Nussbaum said that after Lisa went to ask Steinberg, she heard
noises in the bedroom ``like Joel throwing Lisa,'' the report said.
   Steinberg then appeared in the bathroom carrying the child and
said, as he handed her over to Nussbaum, ``This is your child; what
have you done; this has gone far enough,'' the report said.
   Nussbaum placed Lisa on the floor and noticed water and food
coming out of her mouth.
   The report said Nussbaum thought Steinberg may have poured water
down Lisa's mouth and that she was drowning. Nussbaum said she then
began pumping the child's chest.
   Nussbaum told the psychiatrist that Steinberg left the Greenwich
Village apartment shortly afterward and returned about 10 p.m.
Around 6 a.m., Steinberg said, ``She's stopped breathing,'' and told
Nussbaum to ``call 911.''
   Lisa was taken unconscious from Steinberg's apartment. She died
three days later at St. Vincent's Hospital.
   Steinberg, a 47-year-old disbarred lawyer, denies he hit Lisa,
and says she fell unconscious after choking on food she had vomited.
   Nussbaum, 46, a former editor of children's books, also was
charged in Lisa's death, but those charges were dropped.
   Nussbaum has spent the last year undergoing physical and
psychiatric rehabilitation for injuries the prosecution says she
suffered at Steinberg's hands.
   In testimony Monday at Steinberg's state criminal court trial, a
photographer said he used poses and lighting tricks to hide bruises
he saw on Lisa when he took pictures of her in school two weeks
before she died.
   Stuart Gross said he initially was reluctant to photograph the
first-grader when he visited the school Oct. 22, 1987, because of
her numerous bruises and dirty, unkempt appearance.
   Gross said he eventually took several black and white pictures of
Lisa. He said he was drawn to her when she began directing two other
children on posing the way he wanted them.
   ``She seemed older, more mature,'' he said.
   ``I put her on the right side and I flooded my light into her and
I had her turn her head this way and down so you wouldn't see it.
The last thing my client wants to see is bruises.''
   He said the rumpled, dirty quality of Lisa's clothing was
eliminated ``in the way I photographed them.''
   Also Monday, Justice Harold Rothwax replaced a juror who sources
say was beaten last week by her live-in boyfriend. The juror is a
30-year-old mother of two whose name was withheld.

<HEAD>Socialite Daughter Of First Lord Beaverbrook Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Janet Kidd, socialite daughter of the first Lord
Beaverbrook, the Canadian-born newspaper magnate and politician, has
died at age 80, her family reported today.
   Mrs. Kidd died Nov. 18 at home in the village of Ewhurst 25 miles
southwest of London. No cause of death was given.
   In 1987, she published ``The Beaverbrook Girl,'' a lively volume
of memoirs about her active and adventurous life, which included
horse breeding and flying helicopters.
   She was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Max Aitken and his first
wife Gladys Drury.
   In 1910, her multi-millionaire father brought the family to live
in England, where he became a Conservative Party legislator and in
1916 bought the Daily Express, turning it into a major national
circulation newspaper.
   He was made a peer with the title Lord Beaverbrook in 1917 and in
World War II was minister of aircraft production and later minister
of supply.
   Janet Kidd grew up surrounded by celebrities, including writer
Rudyard Kipling and politician Lloyd George.
   She met her first husband, Ian Campbell, a compulsive gambler and
heir to a dukedom, in the casino at the fashionable French resort of
Le Touquet. Married in 1927, they were divorced in 1934.
   The following year, she married Drogo Montagu, son of the Earl of
Sandwich, but four years later he was killed as a flying instructor
with the Royal Air Force.
   Her third marriage was to Canadian Army officer Edward Kidd.
After the war, they lived in rural southwest England to indulge in
their mutual love of fox hunting. Her third husband died in 1979.
   At one stage, they were neighbors of the late Evelyn Waugh, whose
novels include ``Brideshead Revisited.''
   Waugh, who was known for his vitriolic pen, described in a
published letter one of their lavish parties _ ``Two bands... a
cabaret, an oyster bar in the harness room, stables floodlit, much
to the discomfort of the horses. One bit an American pornographer
who tried to give it vodka.''
   The bitten man was writer Norman Mailer, sometime husband of Mrs.
Kidd's elder daughter, Lady Jeanne Campbell.
   During her equestrian career, Mrs. Kidd was for more than 20
years a director of the All-England Show Jumping Ground at Hickstead
outside London.
   After twice breaking her back in falls from horses, she took up
racing horse-drawn carriages and breeding tough little Fjord horses
at her stud farm at Ewhurst, where she went to live in 1964.
   Another interest was flying helicopters. She was granted her
helicopter pilot's licence on her 60th birthday.
   In 1960, she bought a second home in Barbados, where she
entertained jet-setters, local politicians and members of various
royal families. She was a close friend of American career diplomat
Averell Harriman, who also had a home there.
   She is survived by a total of two daughters and two sons from her
three marriages.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Celebrates Victory With Hugs, U.S. Hymn In Hometown

<TEXT>
   BAIE-COMEAU, Quebec (AP) _ Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
celebrated his re-election in his rural hometown today with hugs,
handshakes and the playing of the U.S. Battle Hymn of the Republic.
   The American tone to the conclusion of a bitterly contested
contest made no difference to the 5,000 backers crammed into a local
recreation center. The returns showed Mulroney and his Conservative
Party had won an election that centered on the free trade pact with
the United States.
   ``We knew he was going to do it,'' paper worker Maurice Tougas
said of Mulroney's win between gulps of beer. ``Now that he's put
Baie-Comeau on the map, it's never going to come off.''
   Mulroney, who at the midpoint of his first term was third in the
polls behind opposition leaders John Turner and Ed Broadbent, fought
a tough campaign to come back and win a second majority government.
   Mulroney likes to portray himself as a statesman and Canada's
most competent leader, but he thrives on old-fashioned politicking.
   The 49-year-old prime minister comes from a working-class family
in Baie-Comeau, on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River. He was
ambitious and built a successful legal and corporate career in
Montreal.
   He first tried for the Conservative Party leadership in 1976 but
was not successful until 1983, the first year he was elected to the
House of Commons.
   Mulroney is the first bilingual native of Quebec to lead his
party, and he has used that fact skillfully in expanding the
Conservatives' base in that critical, largely French-speaking
province.
   Support for cronies was charged during his first years in office,
dropping his popularity drastically in the public opinion polls.
   Eight Cabinet ministers resigned in separate incidents, but by
the time he called the election Oct. 1 Mulroney had distanced
himself from the controversies and was able to point to an
experienced management team.
   But then Turner put Mulroney on the defensive during televised
debates in late October by charging the trade pact in effect would
sell Canada off to American business interests.
   National campaign chairman John Tory said two events helped the
Conservatives recover two weeks later: Mulroney's impromptu debate
with three free-trade hecklers in Victoria, British Columbia, and
former justice Emmett Hall's statement on free trade.
   Hall, considered the father of Medicare, said the free-trade deal
would not threaten the medical insurance plan. His comments dampened
opposition claims that the deal would hurt social programs.
   Mulroney had planned to stage the campaign on competency and the
prosperity that lasted through his term to create 1.3 million jobs
in Canada.
   By the campaign's closing days, however, Mulroney was exuberantly
telling crowds at his rallies that they had a choice between ``John
(Turner) the Ripper or Brian the Builder.''
   He described the opponents of the trade agreement he signed last
January with President Reagan as jittery, negative defenders of past
traditions that could not survive in the modern world.
   Mulroney, by contrast, saw himself as a ``nation builder,'' ready
to lead a competent Canada into full competition with the much
larger and more powerful United States.
   The phrase surfaced in the last of six hours of a debate last
month, when Turner accused the prime minister of selling out Canada
with the free trade agreement.
   Mulroney replied that he carried through on the agreement to
build Canada, just as his father had gone to northeastern Quebec 55
years ago where he and hundreds of other laborers built a small town.
   ``I believe that in my own modest way, I am nation building
because I believe this benefits Canada, and I love Canada,'' the
prime minister said.
   The prime minister is a Roman Catholic. He is married and has
four children.

   A 20-year-old former Soviet paratrooper has been
hospitalized here for tests to determine if he can receive a bone
marrow transplant to treat his leukemia.
   Alexander Muchnik of Klaipeda in the Lithuanian republic was
scheduled to undergo tests today at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   Soviet doctors gave him little chance of surviving the illness
when his condition was diagnosed in July.
   Doctors in the Soviet Union couldn't perform the necessary
transplant, said Muchnik's aunt, Rosa Muchnik.
   Muchnik left his country Sunday on a trip set up by an uncle who
arranged for the international medical help.
   Meantime, the family raised only a few thousand dollars toward
the cost of the transplant.
   Muchnik's only source of bone marrow for the transplant is his
15-year-old sister, Viktoria, who accompanied Muchnik on the trip
along with their mother and stepfather. Muchnik's grandmother lives
is Brighton.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Sets Chicago Mayoral Vote Next Spring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chicago's mayoral race moves into high gear now,
with an Illinois Supreme Court's ruling that the election must be
held early next year.
   At least two of the seven hopefuls began running radio
advertisements on Monday. And the court's decision drops a political
barrier to the expected announcements that Mayor Eugene Sawyer and
State's Attorney Richard M. Daley will run.
   ``This starts the positioning phase of the race,'' said Don Rose,
a strategist for Alderman Timothy Evans, one of the contenders to
fill out the last two years of the late Harold Washington's term.
   ``The public is still not fully involved at this point,'' Rose
said, ``so it becomes a period of jockeying and preparing for the
hard decisions, such as whether to continue.''
   Most of the candidates have said they are in the contest to the
end, but because of racial issues involved, it's become commonplace
to assume some will drop out.
   Political observers seem to agree that there can be no more than
one black candidate if the black voting bloc that made Washington
the city's first black mayor is not to be split.
   Likewise, a fragmented white vote probably would mean a
continuation of blacks controlling City Hall.
   Sawyer, who was appointed by City Council after Washington's
death of a heart attack on Nov. 25, 1987, had been hoping for a
ruling that would allow him to serve out the full term, through 1991.
   But the court on Monday sided with city officials who scheduled a
Feb. 28 primary and an April 4 general election next year.
   The seven justices ruled that state laws governing vacancies in
office were designed to ensure that an appointed official would not
serve such a long portion of an unexpired term.
   Although Sawyer had hoped for a different ruling, he indicated he
was prepared to run and said he was ``pleased that this decision has
been made and that the people in Chicago are no longer in limbo.''
   ``We are ready for the upcoming election and look forward to
winning it,'' said Sawyer, who has raised nearly $3 million in less
than a year against the possibility of a spring election.
   Daley, widely reported to be planning a second bid for the job
his father held for two decades, said he would make an announcement
``in the next two weeks.''
   ``This is a serious decision,'' Daley said, adding that ``the
public is happy that the Supreme Court finally rendered a decision''
on the election question.
   Evans and Danny Davis, both considered leading contenders for
Washington's mantle of black political leadership in Chicago, also
praised the ruling.
   According to a recent Chicago Sun-Times@ABC-TV poll, Daley is
supported by 37 percent of all voters; Evans by 22 percent, Sawyer
by 10 percent, and Alderman Lawrence Bloom 9 percent.
   The remaining 22 percent was undecided or divided among the other
announced candidates _ Davis and white Alderman Edward Burke, former
Chicago Parks District Superintendent Edmund Kelly.

   A reorganization at the United Nations has
ended Britain's leading diplomatic role in the Arab-Israeli conflict
and strengthened the control of the U.N. secretary-general over
peacemaking efforts.
   Under the restructuring announced Monday, Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar is taking immediate control over diplomacy
and the arrangement of peace accords, and delegating the
implementation of those accords to senior officials, U.N.
spokeswoman Nadia Younes said.
   She announced the immediate transfer of Undersecretary-General
Marrack Goulding's responsibility for Arab-Israeli problems to Perez
de Cuellar.
   Goulding, a Briton, will now head the Office of Special Political
Affairs, with responsibility solely for peacekeeping operations,
except regarding the U.N. military observers in Afghanistan and
Pakistan.
   The U.N. mediation of the Afghan accords were conducted by Diego
Cordovez of Ecuador, who received credit for that settlement.
   The changes end Britain's longstanding ``portfolio'' for
Arab-Israeli affairs at the United Nations, under which British
officials at the United Nations conducted most diplomacy in the
region.
   The first hint of an impended change in the reviatlized United
Nations came in June when Perez de Cuellar took charge of cease-fire
negotiations between Iran and Iraq. Iran and Iraq agreed to halt
their eight-year war in August, and negotiations over borders and
prisoners are continuing under U.N. auspices.
   Perez de Cuellar, a Peruvian, also personally initiated
negotiations between the leaders of the Greek and Turkish
communities on Cyprus aimed at ending partition of the island.
   Ms. Younes said the secretary-general is making the changes ``in
response to the increasing demand for his good offices in the
maintenance of international peace and security and for United
Nations peacekeeping operations.''
   She declined to characterize the change as a promotion or
demotion.
   Goulding will also be in charge of ``the planning and conduct of
future peacekeeping operations,'' a formidable task with several
potential new missions on the horizon, the spokeswoman said.

<HEAD>Mexican Police Believe Raft Assailants May Have Been Drug Dealers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mexican police believe that snipers who
fired on a three-member Rio Grande rafting party, killing one, were
drug traffickers who resented the Americans' unwitting intrusion
into a drug deal.
   U.S. and Chihuahua state police searched the rugged area Monday
and enlisted a top tracker to find the attackers who killed Michael
Heffley, 40, as he tried to drag his wounded wife, Jamie, 32, to
safety.
   Police have not identified suspects or made any arrests in the
attack, which occurred Saturday during a rafting excursion outside
Big Bend National Park on the southwestern Texas border between the
United States and Mexico.
   Authorities later combed the area on horseback and discovered
tracks that indicated the assailants fled on horses toward Mulato, a
Mexican town about 15 miles from the shooting scene.
   Heffley was shot in the back with a .30-30 caliber rifle as he
tried to help his wife from the raft under a barrage of gunfire,
authorities said. She had been wounded in the left side and left
shoulder.
   The couple's guide, Jim Burr, 36, an employee of Terlingua-based
Far Flung Adventures, was shot in the right thigh with a .22-caliber
rifle, said Jesus Porras Vega of Mexico's Chihuahua state judicial
police.
   Mexican police theorize the snipers, who fired from atop
300-foot-high bluffs in Mexico overlooking the Rio Grande, were drug
traffickers who resented the boaters' unwitting intrusion into an
illegal drug transaction.
   ``The assailants didn't want them to see,'' said state police
officer Jesus Porras Vega.
   Smuggling has been an economic cornerstone of the area for years.
Horses and guns were the first contraband; later, smugglers took
candelilla leaves from the United States back into Mexico to boil
and turn into candle wax.
   Marijuana is now smuggled across the border, though little of it
passes through on the ground in the Big Bend region. Most marijuana
crossing into Texas is flown in by large-scale traffickers.
   Presidio County Sheriff Rick Thompson said he doubts the
smuggling theory. He and Porras said the area near the ridge had
been a marijuana field in the past, but was not used for that
purpose this year.
   ``It's not like they (the assailants) were out there tending
their marijuana or cutting or harvesting it or whatever,'' Thompson
said. ``So there was no provocation.''
   Residents of the isolated area along the river think the
assailants might have been under the influence of drugs.
   ``I think they were drunk or something and said, `Hey, let's see
if we can hit the raft,''' said Ed Allen, assistant manager of
Lajitas-based Big Bend River Tours.
   The two injured were in stable condition Monday at Brewster
Memorial Hospital in Alpine. ``My wound's pretty minor. I just got a
hole in my leg,'' Burr said.
   At the time of the shooting, the assailants were in Mexico and
the victims were in the United States, meaning the attackers could
be tried in either country, officials said.

   An 11-year-old girl who was the world's first
recipient of a heart-liver transplant was released from the hospital
following surgery to clear blocked bile ducts.
   Stormie Jones of White Settlement, Texas, was released Monday
from Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in fair condition and was
scheduled to return home immediately, said a hospital spokeswoman.
   She was admitted to the hospital Oct. 26 because doctors feared
she was rejecting her organs. But she began improving after doctors
performed surgery Nov. 8 to clear the blockages.
   Stormie received her transplants on Valentine's Day 1984. She
needed the transplant because of a rare congenital disease that
increased the cholesterol in her blood to dangerous levels.
   She is the only surviving recipient of the double transplant.

<HEAD>Man Released after Awaiting Trial for 17 Months in Triple Homicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state judge citing inconclusive evidence set a
career criminal free after the 62-year-old man spent 17 months in
jail awaiting a trial on triple murder charges.
   ``Good luck,'' Justice John Leahy told William Gergel as he
ordered Gergel's immediate release on his own recognizance Monday.
``Stay out of trouble.''
   Assistant District Attorney James Quinn had recommended the
release although he was not prepared to dismiss the indictment
against Gergel. Prosecutors need two more months to complete their
investigation into the case, he said.
   ``The evidence against Gergel and another reported suspect is
still too inconclusive to require that Gergel remain in jail,'' said
Dick Piperno, a spokesman for Queens District Attorney John Santucci.
   Under state law, there is no deadline for bringing murder
defendants to trial.
   Gergel, who has a record of convictions ranging from larceny to
murder and has spent more than 25 years in jail for crimes from the
1940s to 1970s, was arrested shortly after the June 1987 killings of
three people during a liquor store robbery.
   Police said Gergel matched a vague description compiled from
interviews with witnesses. But another man, Lawrence Condon, also 62
and with a long criminal record, emerged as a suspect much later,
after Gergel was already in jail.
   Condon, who has not been charged in the triple murder, is
currently serving time in Attica state prison on a weapons
conviction in a separate case. He and Gergel have denied committing
the liquor store robbery and killings, in which the victims were a
couple in their 60s who owned the store and a 35-year-old customer.
   ``In my opinion, it's too little, too late,'' Gergel's attorney,
Marvyn Kornberg, said of his client's release. ``They should have
done this a long time ago. The (district attorney's) office should
not take 18 months to investigate a case that the police screwed
up.''
   Gergel, thin with long gray hair, left the courtroom and kissed
his tearful wife, Judith, then met a sister he had not seen in 11
years _ and who had thought he was dead until seeing his picture in
a newspaper a few weeks ago.
   ``It's been so wrong from the beginning,'' Gergel said of his
arrest in the triple murder. ``I'm not mad at the district attorney,
but at the police at the 110th Precinct.''
   Kornberg said Gergel plans to try to find a job.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviets Sign Preliminary Agreement To Test Athletes For Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union have signed a
preliminary agreement for a drug-testing program of their top
athletes in training, a Soviet sports official said today.
   Edwin Moses, a two-time Olympic champion in the 400-meter
hurdles, said the agreement ``will reduce the paranoia between their
athletes and ours, the skepticism, especially on our side, which has
led to the escalation of abuse. This is a major step forward.''
   Most observers believe that without testing in training, the
fight against doping _ the use of drugs by athletes to improve their
performance _ will never be won.
   American and Soviet athletes are currently tested only during
certain events, including the Olympics and other major
championships. They are generally not tested during the off-season
or on short notice.
   Sergei Portugalov, a doctor on the U.S.S.R. Sports Committee and
a member of the U.S.-Soviet panel, said today that a ``memorandum of
agreement'' was signed late Monday.
   The document was signed by Baaron Pittenger, executive director
of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Vasily Gromyko, deputy chairman
of the Soviet State Committee for Physical Culture and Sports. It is
subject to approval by both nations' Olympic committees.
   Moses, who has been a long-time campaigner against drug abuse,
told reporters in Moscow Monday that he thinks U.S. athletes of will
be pleased to cooperate because ``they will view this situation, of
being an Olympic competitor, as being a responsibility more than
being a privilege.''
   Portugalov, who heads the sports medicine laboratory section of
the Soviet Sports Committee, said no dates have been set and no
decision has been made on how many athletes will be subject to the
testing, Portugalov said.
   ``American officials will visit Soviet training camps and Soviet
officials will go to U.S. training sites twice a year to carry out
the testing,'' Portugalov said.
   Not only anabolic steroids, which can improve an athlete's bulk
and performance, will be tested for, according to the agreement.
   ``We want to test any group of drugs that are banned by the
International Olympic Committee,'' Portugalov said.
   Drug tests will also be carried out during dual American-Soviet
athletic meets, such as in swimming and track and field.
   Portugalov said he hopes other nations will join the U.S.-Soviet
initiative: ``This agreement is open for all other countries ... We
invite any other country to join us in our battle to to solve the
doping issue in sports.''
   Most recently, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of an
Olympic gold medal he won in the Seoul Olympics in September after
testing positive for anabolic steroids.
   The International Olympic Committee has sponsored an anti-doping
charter, and sports ministers from at least 70 countries are
expected to ratify it during a conference in Moscow that began
Monday, and that was independent of the meeting of sports officials
from the two superpowers.
   The only problem in the U.S.-Soviet agreement was blood doping,
``because there are no test methods yet,'' Portugalov said.
   Testing for blood doping, which can improve an athlete's
performance in endurance sports like cross-country skiing and
marathon running, has not started yet. Blood-doping is banned by the
IOC.

   The kidnapped 15-month-old son of a
West German millionaire was found dead today, ten days after he was
seized during a bloody break-in at his parents' house, police said.
   The boy's 56-year-old grandmother was strangled in the Nov. 12
attempted robbery at the home of Christian Padberg, a wealthy
building material trader.
   The intruder then fled with 15-month-old Patrick Padberg and
later demanded several million marks (dollars) in ransom.
   The boy's body was found early this morning not far from his
parents' house, said Juergen Siegert, head of the police team
investigating the crime.
   Police also said a suspect has been arrested in the case, but did
not identify him.
   According to police reports on the Nov. 12 break-in, the intruder
was trying to break open a safe when he was apparently surprised by
the boy's grandmother and great-grandmother.
   The grandmother was strangled, apparently after struggling with
the intruder, who police said locked the baby's 76-year-old
great-grandmother in a room before fleeing with the child.
   The boy's parents were on a vacation in Greece at the time of the
kidnapping.
   Eslohe is about 60 miles northeast of Cologne.

   A wet winter storm swept through much of the Northwest today,
dumping rain and snow, as gale winds whipped through parts of New
England and snow dusted higher elevations in New Hampshire.
   In the Northwest, the Washington Cascade mountains and the
northwest California mountains had a winter storm watch posted
through tonight, warning of heavy snow and strong winds.
   A similar advisory was in effect through Wednesday for the
Siskiyous mountains of Oregon and the mountains of Idaho.
   Showers extended over northern California, Oregon, northern
Nevada and western Montana early today. It rained in the lower
elevations and snowed in the mountains.
   In New England, gale winds swept through coastal areas. Three
inches of snow fell on Mount Washington in northern New Hampshire
this morning.
   Elsewhere, rain extended from west central Florida through the
northeast part of the state.
   Tropical storm Keith was in the Gulf of Mexico and headed toward
Florida. The storm was moving north-northeast at slightly less than
10 mph. But Keith was expected to take a more easterly path.
   Today's forecast called for scattered rain over central Florida;
rain from the northern and central Pacific Coast to western Idaho,
the Idaho Panhandle and northwest Montana, with snow in higher
elevations, and strong, gusty winds from the northern two-thirds of
the Pacific Coast to the Pacific Northwest and the northern half of
the Rockies.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 20s and 30s in northern
New England and northeast New York, northern and upper Michigan,
Wisconsin, Minnesota and North Dakota; the 40s and 50s from central
New England to North Carolina, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley and
the Tennessee Valley, from Iowa and South Dakota to northern
Louisiana and northern Texas, from Montana to central sections of
New Mexico and Arizona, and the northern Pacific states; the 80s in
central and southern Florida, and scattered along the southern coast
of California; and in the 60s and 70s in the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Williston, N.D., to 80 degrees at Key West and Homestead,
Fla.

   Four California prisoners who shimmied down knotted bed sheets to
freedom were still at large today, but a double murderer who
burrowed out of a 153-year-old New Jersey penitentiary was captured
three blocks away.
   In New York City, meanwhile, three foreign nationals who tried to
break out of federal custody were arrested early Monday on a
rain-soaked parapet of the prison.
   Authorities in Santa Ana, Calif., continued their search today
for the four prisoners, including one booked for investigation of
murder, who escaped from the Orange County Jail Sunday evening.
   The four were part of a recreation group meeting on the jail
roof. They got out by cutting a small hole in a security fence and
scaling down a rope made of knotted bed sheets, said sheriff's Lt.
Richard Olson.
   It was not known what kind of tools they used or how they eluded
guards during the scheduled recreation period, Olson said.
   In Trenton, N.J., a convicted double murderer had 14 hours of
freedom after he chipped his way out of his cell and scaled a wall
at Trenton State Prison, prompting an intensive manhunt.
   Gonzalo Marrero, 37, who is serving at least 60 years for two
execution- style homicides, did not get far from the prison after
the escape early Monday, but eluded hundreds of police and tracking
dogs for several hours.
   He was captured after two Trenton police officers on foot spotted
him talking to another man about three blocks from the prison, in
the area police had searched all day.
   Marrero, who fled when he saw the approaching officers, was
caught a block away. He was carrying a handmade knife.
   In New York, federal investigators were trying to find out how
the foreign nationals got the hacksaw blade they used to saw through
the bars and plastic window of an eighth-floor room.
   They apparently used twine to drop to a fourth-floor setback of
the building, said U.S. Marshal Romolo J. Imundi.
   Marshals using a Fire Department ``cherry picker'' got the
prisoners down.

<HEAD>Labor-Likud Talks Break Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks aimed at forming a broad-based coalition
government with the right-wing Likud and leftist Labor parties broke
off today over what post Labor leader Shimon Peres might have in a
new Cabinet.
   A Labor Party statement broadcast by Israel radio said there
appeared to be ``no basis'' for continuing exploratory talks about
joining Likud.
   Officials said the talks broke down over Labor demands for senior
Cabinet posts and an active search for peace negotiations with the
Arabs, who have revolted against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories since Dec. 8. At least 314 Palestinians and 11 Israelis
have died in the unrest.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, which is headed by Peres,
left open the possibility talks could resume later.
   However, some Labor Party officials said it was likely Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir would now form a narrow government with
small religious and right-wing parties.
   A Peres aide said the talks broke down over Labor's demand for
parity in top Cabinet posts and the peace issue. He said Likud would
not give a definite answer.
   ``(Likud leaders) didn't say no, but they didn't say yes. Most of
all they didn't convince Labor this would be a government that would
put Israel on the right track toward peace,'' he said on condition
of anonymity.
   Shamir's Likud, which won 40 seats in the 120-member parliament
in the Nov. 1 elections, secured the majority needed for a coalition
by allying with seven religious and far-right parties.
   But Shamir, seeking to blunt the power of the small parties,
heeded a call from President Chaim Herzog to try to include Labor in
a national unity government.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said even if the breakdown in
talks with Labor proved permanent there was a possibility that Labor
would join the government in a narrow capacity at a later date.
   Shamir has 13 days before he needs to report to the president on
his efforts to form a new government. Herzog could grant him a
three-week extension.
   Another Shamir aide who demanded anonymity said the talks
deadlocked over Labor demands that it get two of the four major
portfolios _ prime ministry, defense, foreign affairs and finance.
   Israel radio said agreement was reached that Shamir would stay as
prime minister and Labor's Yitzhak Rabin would remain as defense
minister. But there was an impasse over the remaining two posts, one
of which Peres sought for himself.
   The Shamir aide said Likud refused to grant a Labor demand for
veto power in the inner Cabinet, a group of senior ministers who
make key policy decisions.
   In the outgoing coalition government, formed after the 1984
elections ended in stalemate, each party has five seats in the inner
Cabinet, and no major decisions are taken without a consensus
between the two major parties.
   Shamir aides said talks continued with the small religious
parties.
   Israel radio quoted Labor officials as saying they believed
Shamir faced a difficult task in working out an agreement to satisfy
ultra-Orthodox without alienating Jewish supporters of Israel abroad.
   If Shamir forms a government without Labor, he will likely face
increased pressure from the far-right to launch a campaign to
establish new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and
perhaps annex occupied territory.
   He may also face new pressure from Jewish fundamentalists to
enforce the observance of the Sabbath by closing restaurants and
soccer stadiums and to tighten laws against the sale of pork.
   But promises to the religious have already raised the ire of
North American and European Jews, who warn they may cut political
and financial support to Israel if the new government approves the
so-called ``Who Is A Jew'' legislation.
   The change would make ineligible for immigrant status any Jew who
was converted by non-Orthodox rabbis. Jews abroad see the proposal
as an attack on the Reform and Conservative movements in Judaism.

<HEAD>Queen Opens Parliament With Packed Legislative Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II opened a new session of
Parliament today by announcing government plans to force political
candidates in Northern Ireland to renounce violence and to impose
new controls on Britain's secret service.
   The monarch, wearing a long white gown and the state imperial
crown, outlined the far-reaching legislative program before
ermine-robed peers, diplomats and other members of the royal family
in the House of Lords.
   By tradition, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, whose officials
wrote the speech, and the other members of the House of Commons
stood at the back of the chamber.
   The Queen's speech, the 10th written by the Conservative
government since Mrs. Thatcher won power in 1979, also spelled out
plans to sell off the state-owned water and electricity utilities.
   The sales, bitterly opposed by the opposition Labor Party, are
the biggest and most controversial of Mrs. Thatcher's massive
privatization program.
   Crowds gathered in sunshine and cheered as the 62-year-old
monarch and her husband, Prince Philip, traveled to Parliament from
Buckingham Palace in a new horse-drawn coach, a bicentennial gift
from Australia.
   The $218,000 coach, the first new royal coach since 1910,
replaced the Irish State Coach traditionally used for the state
opening of Parliament. The coach, drawn by four gray horses, was
decorated at the queen's request with a kangaroo and the Australian
coat of arms instead of the royal arms.
   Australia is among 17 former British colonies that continue to
recognize the queen as their head of state.
   The 10-minute speech read by the queen outlined 16 new pieces of
legislation the government plans to introduce in the coming year.
   ``A bill will be introduced to put the security service on a
statutory basis,'' said the queen, announcing that formal operating
rules will be drawn up for the first time for Britain's MI5
counter-intelligence service.
   It remained unclear, however, whether the bill will make the
service accountable to Parliament. Officials said the measures would
not apply to MI6, the intelligence-gathering service.
   Some analysts predicted the bill will concentrate on tightening
MI5 agents' oaths of secrecy following the government's failed
attempt through courts in several countries to suppress the memoirs
of retired agent Peter Wright.
   Wright claimed in his book, ``Spycatcher,'' that MI5 tried to
destabilize the 1970s Labor Party government, bugged foreign
embassies and plotted to assassinate Egyptian President Gamal Abdul
Nasser.
   The proposed new laws include a liberalization of the 1911
Official Secrets Act, although critics note the proposals still
would not allow civil servants who leak unauthorized documents to
argue they acted in the public interest.
   On Northern Ireland, the queen said legislation will require
election candidates to make ``a declaration against terrorism.''
   The measure is aimed at the outlawed, mainly Roman Catholic Irish
Republican Army and its legal political front, Sinn Fein. The IRA is
fighting to unite Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic in a
single Catholic state.
   The government will make a new attempt to stop job discrimination
against the Catholic minority in the strife-torn British province,
and propose that all enterprises with as few 10 employees provide
data on the religious composition of its workers.
   The non-violence pledge proposed for electoral candidates follows
a ban this fall on broadcast interviews with members of the IRA and
10 other militant Northern Ireland groups, Catholic and Protestant.
   The government, provoking charges that it is sacrificing
democratic principles in an attempt to wipe out the IRA, also plans
to end the right of suspects throughout most of the United Kingdom
to remain silent under police interrogation.
   Other measures included a proposed bill to force soccer fans to
carry identity cards in a bid to curb the notorious behavior of
hooligan supporters.

<HEAD>Amnesty Reports Human Rights Violations in Indian State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today accused
police of beating, raping and fatally torturing people in custody in
the eastern state of Bihar.
   A spokesman for the Indian government refused to comment on the
report.
   The London-based human rights organization released a report
accusing Bihar police of ``deliberate unlawful killings and
ill-treatment, including rape.''
   ``No effective action appears to have been taken impartially to
investigate abuses or to halt or prevent their occurrence,'' the
report said.
   Amnesty said many of the victims were members of lower classes,
including landless laborers campaigning for minimum wages and land
reform.
   ``Some have been assisted by left-wing groups, including groups
which have used violence,'' the report said. ``On the other hand,
landlords assisted by private armies or criminal gangs, have also
resorted to violence.''
   The report said local landlords or their armies were ``apparently
encouraged by the police'' in some cases.
   The report cited an incident in April 1986 in which police fired
on a public meeting in the village of Arwal. At least 23 civilians
were killed. The meeting was organized by a left-wing group to
support claims to a piece of land by nine villagers.
   Newspapers said an official inquiry into the firing ``blamed the
police for using more force than the situation required.''
   According to Amnesty, ``no disciplinary or judicial action was
taken against any policeman involved in the incident.''
   Bihar is the poorest of India's 25 states. Its 80 million people,
about one-tenth of India's population, have an annual per capita
income of about $110, less than half the national average of $290.

<HEAD>King Assassin Claims FBI Framed Him For 1968 Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty to
assassinating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., says he was framed to
cover up an FBI plot to kill the civil rights leader and wants the
government to reopen his case.
   Ray, 60, was sentenced to serve 99 years for King's murder in
Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968. The Tennessee parole board has
scheduled a January parole hearing for him, but Ray says he is not
hopeful.
   ``I doubt very much they'll give me a parole,'' he said. ``I
think the only way I'll get out of here is through a jury. If they
wouldn't grant me a trial I don't see how they'll grant me a
parole.''
   Ray pleaded guilty on the day his trial was to begin on March 9,
1969, but recanted three days later and has not received a complete
trial to prove his innocence.
   He alleges the FBI threatened to jail his father and brother if
he didn't sign a confession. Ray's father was a fugitive from prison
and his brother spent several years in jail.
   In an interview at Brushy State Prison in East Tennessee with
talk show host Morton Downey Jr., Ray claimed he was set up in a
plot to kill King, whose calls for economic justice for minorities
and effective use of non-violent protest drew the wrath of then-FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover.
   He said the government has refused his requests to review the
evidence against him, has never conducted ballistics tests on the
alleged murder weapon and has suppressed witnesses and
investigations that could have cleared him.
   ``Since they won't, they must be hiding something,'' Ray said of
the FBI. The show is scheduled to be aired Nov. 28.
   King was in Memphis the day of his assassination to support a
strike by city sanitation workers seeking higher pay. Ray was
identified from fingerprints on a rifle found near the Lorraine
Motel in Memphis where King was killed as he stood on a balcony.
   Hosea Williams, an aide to King present when he was shot, said
during taping Monday of ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show '' that ``I've
never believed Ray killed Dr. King.''
   Williams said King was convinced that Hoover's FBI was plotting
his death. He also said he was surprised to find days after the
assassination that ``Ray had no political philosophy. He was just a
two-bit redneck hustler.''
   Many blacks have expressed anger that the Tennessee board has
scheduled a January parole hearing for Ray. Under a 1985 law
providing parole hearings for inmates held for 20 years, Ray became
eligible for parole consideration this month.
   The law was designed to allow the state to relieve prison
overcrowding.
   James M. Brown, chairman of the Tennessee Voters Council and a
member of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Committee,
called Ray's parole hearing ``cruel, dangerous and shameful,'' and
said he would ask Gov. Ned McWherter to call it off. He noted the
hearing in January would coincide with the Jan. 16 holiday honoring
King's birthday.
   But McWherter told reporters Monday that he will not interfere
with the decision of the board, which by law is an independent state
agency.

<HEAD>Clothing Costs Up Sharply; Food Price Hikes Moderate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A second straight sharp increase in clothing
prices associated with the new fall lines sent consumer prices up
0.4 percent in October, the government said today.
   The 1.8 percent gain in apparel costs was accompanied by a
moderation in price gains for food, which had posted steep,
drought-related increases over the summer.
   The jump in clothing prices was virtually as steep as the 2.0
percent increase posted in September. Over the last three months,
apparel costs have replaced hospital costs and food prices as the
greatest stimulant of inflation, the Labor Department said in
releasing today's report.
   The 0.4 overall October increase would amount to an annual
inflation rate of 5.1 percent if it persisted for 12 months. The
annualized rate had declined to 4.1 percent in September on a large
drop in gasoline costs.
   Gasoline prices fell an additional 1.0 percent in October
following a 1.7 percent drop in the preceding month. But the
decrease was not big enough to offset a 1.4 percent increase in
electricity and natural gas costs, which raised consumer energy
prices for the month by 0.1 percent.
   Food prices rose just 0.2 percent, one-fourth the 0.8 percent
jump of September, on large decreases in prices for fruits and
vegetables, poultry and pork.
   Fruit and vegetable prices actually fell 1.1 percent in October
after rising a total of 12.9 percent the preceding three months
because of drought-related shortages. Prices for beef, pork and
poultry last month fell 0.3 percent, 0.8 percent and 3.0 percent,
respectively.
   Offsetting those lower prices was the biggest monthly price
increase for dairy products since December 1980 _ 0.9 percent.
Cereal and bakery products costs rose 0.7 percent.
   Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.5 percent for the month,
more than half of which was due to sharp increases in clothing
prices and automobile insurance and finance charges, the Labor
Department said.
   The apparel cost gains reflected the introduction of
higher-priced fall and winter fashions, particularly for women's and
girls' clothing, which rose 2.5 percent after a 3.5 percent increase
in September.
   Shoe prices also rose 2.5 percent following a 3.5 percent
increase the previous month.
   Automobile insurance and finance charges rose 1.4 percent and 3.4
percent respectively. New car prices, seasonally adjusted, were up
just 0.2 percent with prices for 1989 models reflecting a little
over one-fourth of the new car prices surveyed in October. The
1989-model prices will continue to be phased in over the next
several months as they replace 1988 models in dealer showrooms.
   Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent, halfway between the
respective 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent increases in August and
September.
   In the last year, medical costs have risen a total of 6.7
percent, compared with increases of 5.2 percent for food, 3.8
percent for housing and 4.6 percent for clothing.
   The October increases raised the department's Consumer Price
Index to 120.2. That mean's a basket of goods costing $100 on
average from 1982 through 1984 would have cost $120.20 last month,
up 40 cents from September and compared with a cost of $115.30 a
year ago.
   So far this year, consumer price inflation has been running at an
annual rate of 4.6 percent, just a fraction ahead of the 4.4 percent
annual rate in 1987.
   But there is no doubt that inflation has been accelerating. In
the first three months of 1987, the annual inflation rate was 4.2
percent. That annualized rate rose to 4.5 percent in the second
quarter and 4.8 percent in the third.
   The Reagan administration in August had forecast that consumer
price inflation would slow to 4.2 percent for all of 1988 and to 3.9
percent in 1989.
   The 23 percent drop in crude oil prices over the last year has
been the biggest damper on inflation, partially offsetting increases
of 5.2 percent for food and 6.6 percent for medical care.
   The respite from large food price increases, which had been
running at an annual inflation rate of more than 9 percent over the
driest summer in decades, was expected to be only temporary.
   Donald Ratajczak, who tracks price changes for Georgia State
University, said the relief consumers felt at the grocery store from
lower meat prices, the result of early slaughters because of
drought-depressed supplies of feed grain, would not last.
   ``The opposite effect will prevail next spring as the supply of
meat animals is reduced, forcing prices higher,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The ultimate con _ selling the Brooklyn Bridge _
is no joke to city authorities who accused two men of prying off
pieces of the historic span and selling them to a scrap metal dealer.
   Damage was estimated at $37,000. The theft severely weakened the
walkway and catwalk of the bridge, and both were closed temporarily
for repairs.
   ``People joke about selling the Brooklyn Bridge, but what these
guys did is not funny, it's dangerous,'' Samuel Schwartz, city
Department of Transportation chief engineer, said Monday.
   Ruffino Sauco and John Berisi were caught dismantling aluminum
pieces of the 105-year-old suspension bridge's pedestrian walkway
Saturday, said Officer Joseph Gallagher, a police spokesman.
   The material was apparently sold as scrap, Gallagher said.
   Transportation officials had been watching the walkway after they
found large pieces missing earlier this month.
   Sauco, Berisi and a third man were seen climbing the historic
span early Saturday evening. Police called to the scene caught Sauco
as the three were using burglary tools to pry supports loose from
the walkway and from a catwalk used by ironworkers, Gallagher said.
   The other two men fled. However, Berisi was arrested an hour
later when he returned to a stolen van, Gallagher said. Sauco told
police the vehicle was used to carry away the pieces of the bridge,
the spokesman said.
   Police were still searching for the third suspect.
   Sauco, 37, and Berisi, 36, were charged with grand larceny,
criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, criminal trespass and
possession of burglary tools, Gallagher said. Berisi also was
charged with stealing the van, possession of a hypodermic needle,
and several previous, unrelated burglaries.
   ``We are pressing the district attorney to see this is treated
very harshly and not just as a prank, particularly the charge of
reckless endangerment,'' Schwartz said.
   ``First, they were flinging these heavy pieces of metal onto the
ground by the bridge,'' he said. ``And for our ironworkers, who
sometimes are called out for emergency repairs in the middle of the
night, it could have cost them their lives.
   ``They're lucky they were caught by police, and not by
ironworkers.''

<HEAD>Edward Kennedy Places a Rose on JFK Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RUNNYMEDE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy laid a white rose
at the foot of a British memorial to his brother, U.S. President
John F. Kennedy, slain 25 years ago today.
   Kennedy today walked across a field and climbed a tree-lined
stone path to the roughly oblong, five-foot high slab of stone that
is Britain's tribute to the assassinated president.
   Wearing a black trenchcoat, he placed the flower at the foot of
the memorial, crossed himself and mouthed a silent prayer.
   Runnymede, 21 miles west of London, was chosen as the site for
the memorial because it was here in 1215 that King John sealed the
Magna Carta, the great charter regarded as the foundation of British
human rights.
   Kennedy came here with three English friends of the family, Dinah
Bridge, Lady Anne Tree and Chiquita Astor, as well as American
artist James Wyeth, painter of a celebrated portrait of President
Kennedy, and historical author Larry Collins.
   The Massachusetts Democrat is in Britain on a private trip and he
visited Runnymede with little advance publicity.
   Kennedy told a reporter the memorial had ``a special meaning to
all the members of the family and I welcome the chance to come out
with some of the close friends ... dear friends of President
Kennedy.''
   ``My sister Kathleen's and my brother Joe's lives were lost not
far from here,'' he said. Kathleen was killed in a plane crash over
northern France in 1948 and Joseph went down with his World War II
bomber over eastern England in 1944.
   Kennedy declined to elaborate on his feelings on the 25th
anniversary of his brother's death, saying: ``We think it's
extremely important to celebrate the life of President Kennedy
rather than the tragedy. We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and
the hope of his life rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   The anniversary attracted a trickle of British Kennedy admirers
to the memorial. Among the first was Daphne James, 44, a publishing
company secretary who said she needed to be somewhere ``where you
feel you're close to him for a little while.''
   Mrs. James was at home on Nov. 22, 1963, when news of the
assassination in Dallas reached Britain.
   ``I think I spent about 2{ hours crying solidly though I was
trying to get a family to bed,'' she said.
   ``He was special and I want for us not to forget he was a special
person.''
   The memorial, paid for by public donations, was unveiled in 1965
and carries an inscription from Kennedy's own words: ``We shall pay
any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or
oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and success of
liberty.''
   It stands on the side of the hill, not on top, to symbolize a
life cut short before its time.

<HEAD>Americans Looking For MIAa To Float Messages On River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Americans hoping to publicize
a $2.4 million reward for the release of any American prisoners of
war plan to float 600 tiny boats across the river dividing Thailand
from Laos.
   Each foam vessel to be floated Wednesday is six inches in
diameter and will carry a rolled message in Thai pinned with a
bamboo toothpick reading:
   ``This boat represents one of about 600 Americans who are still
unaccounted for in Laos. May this effort appease the spirits of
those who have died and help bring back to their families those who
are still living.''
   The U.S. State Department lists 2,393 Americans as missing in
action in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia after the Indochina war, which
ended in 1975 with communist victories. In recent months,
cooperation between the United States and the governments of Laos
and Vietnam has increased in an effort to resolve the issue.
   The State Department has criticized private efforts to resolve
the issue.
   Geographer Michael B. Caron, of Lawrence, Kan., said he and three
other Americans hope to gather information on Americans they believe
are still being held prisoner. Laos has repeatedly denied it holds
any Americans.
   Of the 2,393 MIA cases, the State Department has classified 1,128
as ``killed in action-body not recovered.'' The other 1,265 were
labeled ``prisoner of war-missing in action,'' but all but one case
were changed to the status of presumed dead.
   
   The four Americans, who are based in the northeastern province of
Nakhon Phanom bordering Laos, are members of ``Homecoming II,'' a
private MIA-POW group based in Shawnee Mission, Kan.
   They say they will enlist the help of Thai children to help them
transport and float the small craft on the Mekong River at sunset
Wednesday.
   Two other Americans on a similiar mission crossed the Mekong and
entered Laos illegaly on Oct. 3. to advertise the reward, financed
by donations from U.S. congressmen and private individuals.
   Donna Long and James Copp, both from North Carolina, were
arrested and imprisoned for 41 days. They were released after a U.S.
veterans' group paid $1,500 in administrative fees and canceled a
planned protest.
   Wednesday's planned launch of the messages coincides with the
ancient Thai ``Loy Krathong'' festival, when banana leaf boats are
floated and prayers offered to the water spirits.
   ``Our intention is to stay out of trouble, not to set off
instant, negative alarm that could come back and hurt the Thais,''
said Caron.
   He said he and his colleagues arrived in Thailand three weeks ago.

<TEXT>
   A demonstration by Moslem fundamentalists
protesting a peace agreement with southern Sudanese rebels today
turned into a stone-throwing clash injured 10 people, five of them
seriously.
   Riot police firing tear gas and wielding batons halted the fight,
started by southerners who are mainly Christians and animists.
   Reporters watched as about 500 southerners started stoning 1,500
members of the National Islamic Front marching through the center of
the capital, Khartoum.
   The procession was heading for the Sudanese armed forces
headquarters to lodge a protest with Defense Minister Abdul-Meguid
Khalil.
   After the clash, heavily armed soldiers blocked the way to the
headquarters and the marchers diverted to the Cabinet building.
There, Ali Osman Mohamed Taha, the front's deputy secretary-general,
read out a protest that was to be presented to the government.
   It described the agreement as an act of ``treason to the Sudanese
people and to the armed forces.''
   The Moslem fundamentalists have been protesting a tentative peace
agreement signed last Wednesday between John Garang, leader of the
southern rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army and Mohamad Osman
al-Mirghani, head of the Democratic Unionist Party, a junior partner
in Sudan's coalition government.
   They strongly object to a condition calling for the suspension of
harsh Islamic laws that in Sudan also are applied to the minority
Christians and animists who make up the majority of southerners.
   ``No, no to the traitors, no to peace without Islam,'' chanted
the fundamentalists.
   Southerners attacked them with stones, injuring two men on the
head among others who were hospitalized. It was not clear whether
any southerners were wounded.
   The attackers live in shantytowns and slums in and around
Khartoum and are among the 2 million southerners who have fled the
civil war for safer northern havens.
   Southern rebels took up arms in 1983 against the Moslem-dominated
government in the north, demanding economic and social reforms.

   Lt. Gov. Mike Callihan served an all-Colorado
Thanksgiving meal to a group of needy American Indians from the back
of a Mayflower moving van, provoking protests from some Indians who
called the act ``disgusting.''
   Monday's meal, a promotion for the lieutenant governor's ``Always
Buy Colorado'' program, featured Colorado-grown buffalo, lamb and
rainbow trout, vegetables and multi-grain plains bread.
   Callihan said the event in front of the Capitol was a ``thank
you'' to the Indians for providing food for America's first
Thanksgiving for the Pilgrims 367 years ago.
   But a quiet group of protesters from the American Indian Movement
stood near the moving van that was provided by a local Mayflower
moving company and passed out a statement to reporters that said the
meal was ``disgusting.''
   ``The plan to serve hungry members of the American Indian
community of Denver in back of a Mayflower moving van not only
cheapens one of the greatest expressions of sharing by indigenous
people with Europeans but it also serves to exploit for commercial
gain the most disadvantaged people in the United States. Such
methods would not and should not be tolerated by any other racial or
ethnic group in this country,'' the statement read.
   Homer Eagle Feather, who was one of about a dozen Indians who
were served the meal, said he didn't care about the protest and
thought the meal was ``very nice and very appropriate.''
   Guests for the meal were selected by several Indian service
organizations in the Denver area.
   Callihan, who chairs the Colorado Commission of Indian Affairs,
had billed the dinner as ``Thanksgiving on the Mayflower.''
   ``Every major Indian service agency in metro Denver was asked to
comment on the idea and supported it,'' Callihan said. ``They also
sent a list of people they would like to have attend. The Indian
Commission staff actually put this together. The critics who are
here are also the ones who don't attend any meetings.''
   The Mayflower was the ship on which the Pilgrims sailed to
Plymouth Rock in 1620 to found one of the first colonies in the New
World, marking a key step in the end of Indian domination of North
America.

   The 12 European Economic Community
nations have welcomed the PLO parliament-in-exile's declaration of
an independent Palestinian state as containing ``positive steps''
towards Middle East peace.
   In Jerusalem today, Israeli officials criticized the EEC
endorsement.
   ``We don't see eye to eye with our European friends,'' said a
Israeli Foreign Ministry official who requested anonymity. ``They
see the declaration as a denunciation of terrorism, and we don't.''
   The EEC nations on Monday repeated their call for an
international peace conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict under
U.N. auspices. Israel opposes such a conference, which King Hussein
of Jordan first proposed in 1987.
   In a statement, the EEC foreign ministers welcomed the Palestine
National Council's indirect recognition of Israel's right to exist
and said they were pleased that the PLO body ``explicitly condemned
violence'' in its Nov. 15 declaration of an independent Palestinian
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
   ``The (EEC nations) attach particular importance to the decisions
adopted by the Palestine National Council in Algiers, which reflect
the will of the Palestinian people to assert their national identity
and which include positive steps towards the peaceful settlement of
the Arab-Israeli conflict,'' said the EEC statement.
   It urged ``all parties concerned ... to take this opportunity and
contribute to the peace process in a positive way with a view to a
just, global and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.''
   Israel has rejected the Algiers declaration as neither
recognizing the Jewish state nor renouncing terrorism.
   Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the chairman of the
ministers meeting, called the Palestinian proclamation ``a
historical contribution towards peace in the Middle East,''
   He said Greece would like to see a meeting between the EEC
ministers and Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Arafat.
   ``It is very important for the Twelve to have a direct dialogue
with Arafat, to hear him repeat his Algiers declaration.''
   Papoulias has raised the issue of such a meeting before but the
other EEC nations, notably Britain, oppose this.
   ``We must have an international conference. That is what counts.
That is what's important,'' Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans of
Belgium said after the meeting. ``It's from that conference that a
solution must come.''
   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti of Italy said the EEC states
``must all defend this statement. We must not take diferent
positions.''
   He referred to Greece, which is considering recognizing the
independent Palestinian state along with Israel. Greece now
recognizes neither.
   ``Greeks are satisfied with the statement,'' said Papoulias.
   Paloulias said his government was still discussing the issue of
recognizing the Palestinian state and Israel. ``This problem has
occupied us and continues to do so,'' he said.
   Egypt, Turkey and Cyprus are the only three countries with
diplomatic ties to Israel that have so far recognized the declared
Palestinian state.
   In their statement, the EEC nations expressed concern about
continuing violence on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, the scene of a Palestinian uprising that began almost a year
ago and has claimed the lives of more than 310 Palestinians and of
11 Israelis.

   Psychiatry was systematically used in the 1970s to
suppress Soviet dissidents by declaring them mentally ill and
committing them to asylums, a doctor wrote in the first article
printed by state-run media to acknowledge such abuses.
   ``The leadership was content: in our country there were no
dissidents _ there were only insane people,'' Mikhail I. Buyanov, a
psychiatrist and neurologist, wrote in his historical survey of
Soviet psychiatry, published by the educational newspaper
Uchitelskaya Gazeta.
   Human rights activists in the Soviet Union and abroad have
alleged for years that the Kremlin used psychiatric hospitals to
incarcerate dissidents who were in fact mentally healthy. Some say
the practice began under Josef V. Stalin or Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   The government enacted a new law in January that makes it a crime
to commit a sane person to a mental institution. But public health
officials who have appeared at Moscow news conferences have denied
that dissidents were systematically confined to asylums, or avoided
answering the question.
   However, Buyanov wrote that with the forcible confinement in 1970
of biologist and dissident writer Zhores Medevdev to a regional
psychiatric hospital in Kaluga, ``a new chapter began in the history
of Soviet psychiatry.''
   ``It's true that before this, people were sent to psychiatric
hospitals for reasons that were mostly political, rather than of a
medical character,'' Buyanov said. ``But after 1970, this was done
more and more often.''
   Medvedev, the brother of Marxist historian Roy Medvedev, was
freed after human rights activist Andrei Sakharov, poet and editor
Andrei Tvardovsky and others demanded his immediate release. He now
lives in Britain.
   Anatoly Koryagin, himself a psychiatrist, was sentenced to seven
years in a prison camp in 1981 after accusing Soviet authorities of
sending mentally healthy dissidents to hospitals, where they were
forced to take drugs.
   Those whose confinement Koryagin protested ``were expressing the
same opinions, by the way, as were later heard from the tribune at
the 27th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and the 19th
All-Union Party Conference,'' after Mikhail S. Gorbachev became
Soviet leader in 1985, Buyanov wrote.
   Koryagin was pardoned by parliament last year, freed from labor
camp and emigrated to Switzerland. The government later stripped him
of citizenship ``for causing damage to the prestige of the Soviet
Union.''
   Because of the abuses outlined by Koryagin, the United States and
Britain considered trying to suspend or expel the Soviet Union from
the World Psychiatry Association. The Soviets withdrew from the
association in 1983, before a drive to expel them could be organized.
   Buyanov gave no figures for the number of dissidents sent to
mental hospitals, but said local party and police officials put
pressure on psychiatrists to declare them insane.
   Although the Ministry of Health instructed psychiatrists to
ignore the opinions of non-professionals, ``Moscow was far away, and
the local city party secretary was right next door,'' he wrote.
   A definition of schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, that was
advanced by Soviet health specialists citing Marxist-Leninist
doctrine also enabled psychiatrists to diagnose the ailment in sane
people, Buyanov wrote in the article published by Uchitelskaya
Gazeta on Saturday.
   Under Leonid I. Brezhnev, Soviet leader from 1964 to 1982,
psychiatrists gave law enforcement officials the notion that
``anyone who is against anything, it doesn't matter what, is a
covert or overt mental case _ more likely a psychopath or a latent
schizophrenic,'' Buyanov said.
   He praised measures taken earlier this year by the Health
Ministry to improve the care of psychiatric patients, but said past
abuses must be recognized. ``We have made mistakes. We have made
them knowingly,'' he said.
   Soviet psychiatrists also must be able to ignore pressure from
authorities and threatening telephone calls and threats ``from
above,'' Buyanov said.
   In February, Modest M. Kabanov, a Leningrad psychiatrist,
acknowledged at a news conference that some doctors in the past
decided ``to send people to institutions for reading Bulgakov's
works or for reading Pasternak's verses and poems.''
   Works by the those two Soviet authors, Mikhail Bulgakov and Boris
Pasternak, had been banned here until Gorbachev instituted his
campaign for greater openness.
   However, Kabanov and other doctors who appeared at the news
conference skirted the question of whether psychiatry had been used
in the Soviet Union to stifle dissent.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush said today that
Michael Boskin ``might well prove'' to be the next chairman of the
president's Council of Economic Advisers but that no decisions have
been made for that position or for secretary of defense.
   Bush told reporters traveling with him to Alabama that reports
saying former Sen. John G. Tower of Texas is in line to become the
next defense secretary were premature.
   ``The Tower story is not right,'' Bush said. ``No decision has
been made.'' He indicated he would not name his new Pentagon chief
until next week at the earliest.
   As for Boskin, a Stanford University professor, Bush said: ``I
haven't sat down and talked to Mike and I want to do that.'' But he
said Boskin is a ``very good man. He might well prove to be the
economic adviser.''
   On Monday Bush announced that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
and Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos would remain in their posts.
He also selected Richard Darman, a former Treasury official, to head
the Office of Management and Budget.
   In the two weeks since he was elected, Bush has filled four
Cabinet jobs. In addition to Cavazos and Thornburgh, Bush said
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady would stay on, and former Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III would become secretary of state. New
Hampshire Gov. John Sununu was selected the White House chief of
staff.
   That still leaves a slew of other top jobs vacant. Here, in no
particular order, are the Cabinets positions as well as the top
agency and executive posts that are still open.
   _ Agriculture. Still in the running is Robert Delano, former
president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. Also mentioned are
Clayton Yeutter, the U.S. trade representative, Sen. Dan Evans,
R-Wash., and Rep. Thomas Coleman of Missouri.
   _ Energy. Former Rep. Thomas Loeffler, who ran Bush's campaign in
Texas, has the inside track, according to the latest purveyors of
gossip. Also talked about are formmer White House aide Fred Khedouri
and former deputy secretary William Martin.
   _ Interior. Gov. Garrey Carruthers of New Mexico has taken
himself out of the running. That leaves Nathaniel Reed, a former
assistant secretary, and Evans high on the list.
   _ Environmental Protection Agency. A new name surfaced Monday:
Jay D. Hair, executive vice president of the National Wildlife
Federation. Still in the running are Michael Deland, an EPA regional
administrator in Boston, and former agency general counsel Francis
Blake.
   _ CIA. There is some thinking that Bush may keep CIA Director
William Webster on as an interim appointment, but others are still
thought to be in the running. They include James Lilley, the
ambassador to Korea, and former national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft.
   _ NSC adviser. Lilley and Scowcroft are also in the competition
for this key spot, along with Winston Lord, the ambassador to China,
and Richard Burt, the ambassador to West Germany.
   _ Defense. Tower, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, is the most often-mentioned person for the job, but other
names have surfaced, including Paul O'Neill, the chairman of Alcoa.
Norman Augustine, author of a book which critiqued the Pentagon
procurement system, also is said to have a shot at the job.
   _ Health and Human Services. The same names keep cropping up for
this huge agency. They include Dorcas Hardy, the Social Security
commissioner, former Rep. William Gradison of Ohio, Sen. Lowell
Weicker of Connecticut and Deborah Steelman, a campaign aide to Bush.
   _ Transportation. Matthew Scocozza, a private lawyer who worked
as an assistant secretary, has emerged as a candidate. Others
possibles are Rep. Guy Molinari of New York; Peter Schabarum, an
urban transportation expert, and James Burnett, former head of the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   _ Labor. Rep. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania is a leading contender,
as is William Kilberg, a Washington lawyer who worked in the
department in the Nixon administration. Ann Dore McLaughlin, the
current secretary, could keep the job, but she'll have stiff
competition from Ridge, Kilberg and former Rep. John Ehrlenborn of
Illinois.
   _ Housing and Urban Development. No new names cropped up on
Monday. Still mentioned as possibilities are Cleveland Mayor George
Voinovich, Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut, businessman Robert
Woodson and campaign official Thaddeus Garrett.
   _ Commerce. Houston oilman Robert Mosbacher, a longtime friend of
Bush, is the odds-on favorite. Others on the list are former
Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, former baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth and James Robinson, head of American Express Co.
   _ Veterans. Rep. Sonny Montgomery, a Mississippi Democrat, says
he has taken himself out of the running for this job, which has
recently been ungraded to a Cabinet-level slot. Ridge has been
mentioned, as has Everett Alvarez, a former deputy administrator of
the Veterans Administration.

   A 13-year-old boy shot himself in the
head after accidentally killing his best friend while the two played
with a handgun, authorities said.
   The body of James ``J.P.'' Herndon was found Monday in a wooded
ravine near his home, a pistol nearby, two days after his friend
Jacob Viviano, also 13, was accidentally shot to death at James'
home.
   Police believe James had shot himself shortly after his friend
died while the two were playing alone. Because of powder burns and
other physical evidence, police believe that James accidentally shot
Jacob.
   Investigators do not believe any foul play was involved or that a
third person participated, said Lt. Dennis Fischer, chief of
detectives for the county sheriff's department.
   The manner of death in both instances was the same: a single
gunshot wound to the head, said Ralph Baahlmann Jr., chief deputy
coroner for Madison County.
   ``I don't know what they would have been doing with a gun,'' said
August C. Viviano Jr., Jacob's father. ``I just can't believe what
happened. He was such a happy boy.''
   After James' body was found Monday, word spread quickly at
Collinsville North Junior High School, where both boys were
enrolled. Some students wiped away tears as they walked to their
buses.
   Friends and relatives of the boys said they were the best of
friends. They stayed overnight at each other's homes, went together
to the Tepee, a gathering place for teens in Collinsville, and were
widely known as pranksters in the neighborhood.

<TEXT>
   Former President Ferdinand Marcos has
asked a Philippine court to allow him to return to his country.
   Marcos filed a petition Monday asking a Manila court to
reconsider a decision last month that banned the exiled leader from
returning to his country to answer testimony against him. Previously
lawyers for Marcos have said he was too ill to travel from Hawaii to
New York to hear U.S. charges against him.
   The court ruled the issue was a ``political matter'' that could
be resolved only by President Corazon Aquino, who refused to allow
Marcos to return for security reasons. Mrs. Aquino came to power
after Marcos was ousted in a civilian-military uprising in February
1986.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, were indicted in New York last month
on charges they diverted $103 million of Philippine government funds
to purchase New York real estate.
   Mrs. Marcos was arraigned on Oct. 31 before a New York federal
court and pleaded not guilty. Her husband's arraignment was
postponed indefinitely after his lawyers claimed he was too frail to
make the 10-hour flight from his exile in Hawaii to New York.
   Doctors have said Marcos, 71, has calcium deposits in his knee
joints, making it hard for him to walk and forcing him to use a
wheelchair. His aides also have said Marcos suffered from chest
pains, severe headaches and an eye ailment.
   Officials at the Sandiganbayan court in Manila said the latest
Marcos petition was filed on his behalf by his sister, Fortuna
Marcos-Barba.
   In the petition, Marcos asked the court to block the scheduled
Dec. 11 deposition by former Public Works and Highways Minister
Baltazar Aquino unless it is done in Marcos' presence. The former
minister is not related to Mrs. Aquino.
   Government lawyers say former minister Aquino has agreed to
testify in the Dec. 11 proceedings about alleged kickbacks Marcos
received from Japanese companies during his 20-year term in office.
   Marcos said that unless he is allowed to return to Manila for the
deposition, the court and the Philippine government ``would be
guilty of trial by publicity.''
   Government lawyers say they plan to use Aquino's testimony
against Marcos when Philippine criminal charges are filed against
him and he is eventually allowed to return to face them. The lawyers
say the former minister's testimony has to be taken soon because he
is ill and may die before Marcos is brought to trial.
   In his petition, Marcos argued that unless he is allowed to
cross-examine Baltazar Aquino, the testimony of the latter will not
be valid.
   The court has given no indication if it will hold hearings on the
latest Marcos petition or dismiss it.

<DATELINE>FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials say the finding that four
young adults had been drinking, and two were legally drunk, when
their car plunged into a New Haven river does not end the
investigation into their deaths.
   Deputy Chief Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver II said Monday that
it was not yet possible to determine what role alcohol played in the
accident.
   The tests found blood-alcohol levels ranging from 0.06 and 0.11
in the four. Under state law, a person is legally drunk with a
blood-alcohol level of 0.10.
   The four 1987 graduates of East Lyme High School _ Michael R.
Gallo, 20, Jill S. Sawyer, Christy S. Stevens and Laura M.
Lagrotteria, all 19 _ drowned early Nov. 13 after the car they were
riding in plunged into the Mill River at a swing bridge that was in
its open position.
   They were missing for several days, prompting a nationwide
search, before the submerged car was found last Thursday.
   The bridge, which pivots on a central axis, has been out of use
since August 1987 and is locked in its open position _ perpendicular
to the road _ to allow boat traffic to pass by.
   Carver declined to say which victims had the higher blood-alcohol
level readings, and authorities have said they haven't determined
who was driving the car. The car was owned by Stevens.
   The blood-alcohol levels correspond roughly to consumption of
between 1{ and five drinks, state Associate Medical Examiner Edward
T. McDonough said. Police have said that a case of beer, most of it
consumed, was found inside the sunken car.
   The youths, all of East Lyme, were reported missing by their
parents in the evening of Nov. 13, about 24 hours after they left
their homes for a night out in New Haven.
   City officials have conceded that there was a gap in concrete
barriers at the bridge the night of crash. Officials have said there
was a time when the two-ton concrete barriers completely blocked the
road, but they have been unable to say why or when the blocks were
moved.
   Robert I. Reardon Jr., an attorney for Stevens' family, said the
blood-alcohol levels were ``inconsequential.''
   ``Virtually anyone driving down that road at night would have
driven off the bridge,'' he said.

   Five children from two families died
early today when they were trapped upstairs in a burning house,
officials said.
   The five, including 3-year-old twins, tried to flee the fire, but
were apparently overcome by smoke, according to Fire Chief Bill
Carter.
   ``They were all in the bed, and the fire went up some stair steps
and the children were just trapped up there.'' he said. ``They all
had attempted to escape through one route or another. Usually smoke
gets them first.''
   The blaze started downstairs, where the parents of two of the
children were sleeping, Carter said. Samuel and Eleanor Todaro were
able to escape unharmed, he said, but they could not rescue the
children because the fire blocked the only staircase.
   He said firefighters arrived quickly, but were also unable to get
upstairs to save the victims, who were ages 3 through 15.
   Carter said it appeared the fire began in a room with a
fireplace, but the cause was still under investigation.
   Carter identified the victims as Stephen and Stephanie
Baumgartner, the twins; Christopher Baumgartner, 15; Amy Todaro, 12;
and Guy Todaro, 7.

<TEXT>
   New York state's highest court today upheld
Bernhard Goetz's conviction for illegal gun possession stemming from
his shooting of four men on a New York City subway car in 1984.
   The unanimous, unsigned ruling by the state Court of Appeals said
that the judge at Goetz's trial, Stephen Crane, did not err in his
charge to the jury. Goetz's attorneys had contended that Crane's
comments unfairly resulted in their client's conviction.
   The Court of Appeals also determined today that a decision by a
midlevel state appeals court rejecting the sentence Crane handed out
to Goetz on the gun possession conviction was proper.
   Today's decision means that Goetz must be resentenced for his
June 1987 conviction for third-degree criminal possession of a
weapon.
   Crane originally sentenced Goetz to six months in jail, a $5,000
fine, 280 hours of community service, five years' probation and
psychiatric counseling.
   But earlier this year, the midlevel appeals court, decided that
Goetz should have been given an indeterminate sentence or, under
terms of New York's tough gun-control law, a one-year term with no
probation.
   Neither the Appellate Division nor the state Court of Appeals
today reinstated any of the more serious charges against Goetz that
his trial jury acquitted him of.
   The December 1984 shooting touched off a storm of controversy
about vigilantism and about racial justice. Goetz is white, while
the shooting victims are all black.
   Goetz argued that he fired in self-defense because he believed he
was about to be mugged, while the young men said that they were only
panhandling.
   Civil suits against Goetz also are pending, according to his
attorney, Mark Baker.
   While all of the men Goetz shot survived the shootings, one has
been left partially paralyzed and suffered brain damage.
   Baker had argued before the Court of Appeals that Crane's charge
to the trial jurors last year that they ``must'' convict if they
found the prosecution had proven its case amounted to taking away
the jury's consitutionally granted discretion. Baker said the judge
should have used the word ``may.''
   But the Court of Appeals concluded today that ``the trial court
did not err in instructing the jury.''
   The court said the jury in the Goetz case still had the option of
acquitting the gunman, even if it had found that the prosecution had
proven its case.

   A Connecticut woman, testifying at the
conspiracy trial of political maverick Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., said
today a LaRouche fundraiser deceived her by telling her $2,000 in
political contributions were loans.
   As defense lawyers tried to show that prosecution witness
Elizabeth Sexton was a willing supporter of LaRouche, the woman who
loaned nearly $113,000 to a LaRouche-affiliated organization that
was never repaid insisted she was misled by fundraiser Joyce
Rubenstein.
   At the opening of the trial of LaRouche and six associates
Monday, Ms. Sexton said Ms. Rubenstein repeatedly promised her the
loans would be repaid at interest rates of up to 17.5 percent.
   Today, Ms. Rubenstein's lawyer, Ed Williams, showed the
75-year-old witness two $1,000 checks made out to campaign
organizations of the minor-party presidential candidate in May 1985.
   Ms. Sexton said those checks were written at the request of Ms.
Rubenstein, adding, ``It was not explained to me that these were
political contributions. I thought they were loans.''
   Asked by Williams why she did not write the promised interest
rate on the memo section of the checks _ as she did with the nearly
$113,000 in loan money _ Ms. Sexton said she did so, but it was
``whited out.''
   LaRouche is charged along with six associates with mail fraud and
conspiracy to commit mail fraud for allegedly raising more than $30
million in loans with no intent of repaying them.
   LaRouche also is charged with conspiracy to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service by filing no returns since 1979, while having all
personal expenses paid from funds of various corporations he
controls.
   Conviction on all counts could carry a prison term of 65 years
and fines of $3.25 million.
   Defense lawyers told jurors in opening statements Monday that
there was no intent to defraud those lending money to LaRouche
organizations. But they contended repayment became impossible when
LaRouche and associates were forced to divert funds toward resisting
attacks from the government and news media.
   Prosecutors began to carefully lay out their case by calling Ms.
Sexton, a gray-haired, matronly looking woman who said the series of
loans she made in 1985 came from ``money my husband left me, my
working capital.''
   Speaking in a firm voice that occasionally rose in anger as she
recounted the loss of $112,800, Ms. Sexton said she repeatedly told
LaRouche fund-raiser Joyce Rubinstein, a defendant, that ``I could
not afford to live without'' the investment money.
   But Ms. Sexton admitted she willingly loaned the money to Caucus
Distributors Inc. _ described by prosecutors as a LaRouche
organization _ because Ms. Rubinstein said it was needed to publish
a book against drugs.
   ``Nancy Reagan asked everyone to get involved,'' Ms. Sexton said,
adding she thought she was doing just that _ and helping her three
grandchildren, too _ by financing the book project.
   She acknowledged under cross examination the book was published,
in Spanish, for distribution in Latin America. Ms. Sexton said she
thought her money would get the book translated into English.
   As Assistant U.S. Attorney John Markham guided her through the
story, he asked the witness if she considered the loan risky.
   Sitting ramrod straight in the witness chair, Ms. Sexton shot
back, ``Joyce assured me my money was safer than with my bank or any
of my investments.''
   Ms. Sexton related how Ms. Rubinstein kept pressing her to lend
more money, and when ``the barrel ran dry,'' the witness said she
complied with the fund-raiser's request to get a bank loan.
   In his opening statement, Assistant U.S. attorney Kent S.
Robinson told jurors ``we are not here to judge'' the politics of
LaRouche, whose views are often described in published reports as
extreme.
   Robinson said that during the alleged loan scam, lasting from
1983 through 1987, LaRouche imposed quotas on fund-raisers and told
them people who didn't give ``were not morally fit to survive.''
   Robinson said the fund-raisers promised lenders high interest
rates and repayment on a quarterly basis, and sent promissory notes
through the mail.
   Defense attorneys countered that LaRouche and the co-defendants
had no intention of defrauding those who loaned the more than $30
million but only received about $3 million in repayments.
   Odin Anderson, LaRouche's attorney, told jurors tat LaRouche had
ordered that loans made to his organization be fully repaid and told
his staff that it would be ``political suicide'' not to pay back
supporters.
   Anderson admitted his client failed to file income tax returns,
but argued there was no intent to evade the law.
   The attorney said LaRouche had no personal income, and ``had a
good-faith belief'' that he was not obligated to file.
   Another defense attorney, Michael Reilly, blamed the inability to
pay back the loans on attacks on LaRouche by ``the most powerful
forces in the country'' _ including the FBI, Internal Revenue
Service, the news media, state law enforcement organizations and the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith.
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
Conviction on all counts could carry a prison term of 65 years and
fines of $3.25 million.
   Six of his associates face lesser sentences if convicted of the
mail fraud and conspiracy charges.
   LaRouche's co-defendants are William Wertz, chief fund-raiser;
his chief legal adviser, Edward Spannaus, and four fund-raisers:
Michael Billington, Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg and Ms. Rubinstein.

   A former American hostage said
today that confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi, when told an
American serviceman aboard the plane was suffering heart pains,
responded ``Let him die.''
   Sue Ellen Herzberg also testified at Hamadi's trial that she felt
``degraded to an animal state'' during the June 1985 hijacking in
which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans
were held hostage for 17 days.
   Mrs. Herzberg and her husband, Richard, were returning from their
honeymoon when Hamadi and an accomplice seized TWA Flight 847 en
route from Athens to Rome and diverted it to Beirut and Algiers.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is accused of murder and air
piracy in the hijacking. He has confessed to the hijacking, but
denies killing Stethem.
   ``We heard terrible beatings and terrible screams in the
first-class compartment,'' Mrs. Herzberg told the court that has
been hearing the case since July 5.
   She said a man sitting behind her was suffered chest pains and
the woman sitting next to him asked Hamadi to call a doctor.
   The defendant then asked the ailing man, U.S. Navy diver Stuart
Dahl, to identify himself, Mrs. Herzberg said.
   ``The man said he was military, and Hamadi said, `Let him die,'''
she told the court.
   Mrs. Herzberg described how the hijackers ``started shouting out
what sounded like Jewish names. One of them was my husband's.''
   These passengers were taken to the back of the plane, she said.
   ``I heard (my husband) say he was German. And that's the last I
heard of him,'' she said.
   Richard Herzberrg was one of several passengers taken off the
plane in Beirut and hidden in the city until the hijacking was over.
The couple was reunited after the 17-day ordeal.
   Mrs. Herzberg described how Hamadi robbed her of about $11,000
worth of jewelry.
   ``I had already been degraded to an animal state and I didn't
want to be degraded anymore, so rather than hand him my jewelry I
threw it on a seat and (Hamadi) dove at the seat like he had found
the Hope diamond.
   ``They touched every part of my body as I was being turned around
and searched,'' she told the court, noting that the hijackers took
her wedding and engagement rings.
   She said Hamadi was giving orders and appeared to be directing
the hijacking.
   ``I still think about the hijacking every day,'' she told the
court. ``I have nightmares and I saw a psychologist for a year.''
   During a break in the proceedings today, jailers could not free
Hamadi from the court security room in which he is locked and had to
use a cutting torch to open the door.
   On Monday, defense attorney Hans-Burkhardt Steck asked the court
to authorize a psychiatric examination of Hamadi, claiming he had
been emotionally damaged as a youth during Beirut street fights.
Steck said his client was ``mentally disturbed'' at the time of the
hijacking.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

<HEAD>Sun-Times Talks Resume As Union Delays Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Chicago Sun-Times and its
editorial employees returned to the bargaining table today, with the
union saying that a strike threat is still in force.
   ``We're not that far apart,'' said Daniel J. Lehmann, spokesman
for Local 71 of the Chicago Newspaper Guild, which represents 250
newsroom employees.
   But he said a company offer presented Monday _ calling for no pay
increase in the first year of a new contract, followed by 3 percent
raises the next two years _ was ``not received favorably'' by guild
members who met Monday afternoon.
   Michael Soll, a Sun-Times spokesman, said: ``I really don't know
that that's the final offer. They're at the negotiating table. It's
difficult to know what's going to come out of it.''
   The union had set a strike deadline of 2:30 p.m. Monday, but
froze the deadline as negotiations continued Monday and resumed this
morning.
   Lehmann, the newspaper's religion writer, reiterated that the
guild negotiating committee could call a strike at any time, and
Soll said again that the newspaper would continue to publish
regardless.
   ``There are people in place to step in in the event they're
needed,'' Soll said.
   Before making the new offer Monday, newspaper management had
sought a 3 percent pay cut for 18 months, followed by restoration of
current pay for the balance of a three-year pact. The guild had been
seeking yearly raises of 6 percent to 7 percent.
   The newspaper's pay scale ranges from $625 a week for starting
reporters to $895 for reporters with five years of experience.
   Union members have been working without a contract since June 1.
A strike would be the first by Sun-Times editorial workers in the
newspaper's 40-year history.
   The Sun-Times says it must control costs to remain competitive
with the larger Chicago Tribune.

<HEAD>Carter Says He'll Press For Release Of Friend In Iranian Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter says he will not
stop pressing for the release of a friend held in an Iranian prison
despite the revelation that the man is wanted on a 10-year-old
federal indictment.
   Terrence B. Adamson, Carter's lawyer, said the former president
has been trying to help free Erwin David Rabhan for several years
and just recently learned of the indictment.
   ``It will not deter us from our effort to help him,'' Adamson
said Monday.
   Carter confirmed Saturday that he has written to the Ayatollah
Khomeini on behalf of Rabhan, a 61-year-old Savannah native. Carter
has not received a reply, Adamson said.
   Rabhan has been held in Iran since 1981 on charges of spying for
the Central Intelligence Agency.
   Rabhan was indicted on Sept. 21, 1978, in Missouri on six counts
of federal securities violations involving the financing of nursing
homes, said Timothy Wilson, an assistant U.S. attorney in St. Louis.
   ``He has been a fugitive for 10 years,'' Wilson told The Atlanta
Constitution in a story published in today's editions.
   Rabhan has been acquainted with Carter since the 1960s, when he
volunteered his services as a pilot during Carter's second
gubernatorial campaign. He later lived for a short time in a
basement room at the Governor's Mansion.
   Carter, in his statement Saturday, gave no information about
Rabhan except to describe him as a friend.
   Adamson said the federal government has been apprised of Carter's
activity.
   Wilson said Rabhan had been involved in numerous business
ventures, and was living in Iran when the indictment was handed up.
He described Rabhan as ``one of the more bizarre people I've ever
run across.''

<HEAD>Agreement For U.S. Bases In Australia Extended 10 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Australia and the United States have
extended their agreement on two U.S. military bases for another 10
years, Prime Minister Bob Hawke told Parliament today.
   In Washington, a State Department official confirmed Hawke's
statement and said the United States was pleased the agreement was
extended.
   The Pine Gap and Nurrunga space satellite facilities had until
now operated under agreements that could be terminated at one year's
notice by either side, Hawke said.
   ``We do not regard this as satisfactory, both because of the
continuing importance of (the bases') effective operation to global
peace and because of the specific benefits to Australia of long-term
access to their capabilities,'' the prime minister said.
   ``We have further agreed that three years' notice shall be
required to terminate the agreement,'' he said.
   He said the United States has also agreed to allow more
Australian involvement in the management of the bases.
   Hawke said that until the early 1980s, only about 10 percent of
the staff at the bases were Australian. He said that under the new
agreement, the Australian staff will increase to about 30 percent of
the employees.
   Another U.S.-run base at North-West Cape, whose military function
is less sensitive than that of Pine Gap and Nurrunga, is not subject
to the new agreement.
   Australian officials said the number of U.S. military personnel
in Australia is classified information.

<HEAD>Judge Says Lawsuits Must Be Consolidated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt ruled today
that a lawsuit filed here to block the deportation of 13 Mariel
boatlift detainees to Cuba must be consolidated with a similar one
brought earlier in Alabama.
   Pratt signed an order to transfer the case to Birmingham after
hearing arguments and rejecting a request for a temporary
restraining order to block the Justice Department from returning the
13 detainees, now in a penitentiary in Talladega, Ala., to Cuba.
   ``I'm satisfied that this case should be transferred to
Alabama,'' Pratt said from the bench. ``There is a similar but not
identical case in the Alabama jurisdiction. We have to have these
cases decided by a single judge in a single jurisdiction.''
   Laurence Eisenstein, representing the 13 detainees, had argued
that the case in Birmingham was based on different issues than the
lawsuit he filed in the District of Columbia.
   Eisenstein said the Birmingham case, involving 15 individual
detainees, involved immigration issues while his class-action suit
filed here dealt with the constitutionality of the Justice
Department's administrative procedures on deportation, such as a
denial of judicial review of such an action.
   Pratt replied, ``I can tell you that if these two cases were
filed in this court, the judge in the first case would have received
the second one under consolidation.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Edith Marshall, representing the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, argued that the cases had to
be consolidated because many issues, such as harm to the public
interest, harm to the United States and U.S.-Cuban relations, were
the same.
   ``It is judicial inefficiecy for two courts to hear these
cases,'' she said.
   The Justice Department announced last week that panels
established in the wake of last year's prison riots by the boatlift
detainees had reviewed their first 28 cases and planned to send at
least 15 of the prisoners back to Cuba ``in the near future.''
   A suit on behalf of the 15 was filed in Birmingham in an attempt
to block the deportations. Two of the 15 declined to join in the
class-action suit filed here.
   The 15 the department said should be repatriated have convictions
ranging from petty larceny to second-degree murder. Most of them
have more than one conviction.
   The three-member Justice Department panels will undertake further
consideration of the remaining 13 detainees in the initial review
group to determine whether they should be returned to Cuba or be
released.
   The detainees are among 125,000 people who came to the United
States in 1980 in a boatlift from Mariel, Cuba. The vast majority of
them have been law-abiding U.S. residents.

<TEXT>
   The transfer of the body of
heiress Christina Onassis to a Greek island for burial has been held
up by judicial authorities pending the determination of the exact
cause of death.
   A preliminary coroner's report said Monday the cause of death was
acute pulmonary edema, or the accumulation of fluid in her lungs.
   Ms. Onassis, 37, died Saturday at the country home of her
friends, Albert and Marina Dodero. A doctor at Clinica del Sol
hospital in Buenos Aires, where the body was first taken, said the
cause of death was a heart attack.
   Heart attacks can cause an accumulation of fluid in the lungs,
but the coroner's report did not say what caused the build-up.
   Ms. Onassis' mother, Athena, died in 1974 at the age of 45 and
medical reports said at the time that she also had died from a
pulmonary edema.
   Forensic experts were analyzing Ms. Onassis' body tissue and
other evidence to determine whether drugs figured in her death.
   Juan Carlos Cardinali, one of three judges handling the case, was
quoted by the private news agency Noticias Argentinas as saying the
investigation was focusing on the possible overdose of barbiturates.
   Family members and friends ruled out suicide.
   They said Ms. Onassis, heiress to the fortune of shipping tycoon
Aristotle Onassis, appeared happy in her final days, and was
considering the purchase of an apartment in Buenos Aires.
   Unconfirmed local news reports said Ms. Onassis planned to marry
Jorge Tchomlekdjoglou, the brother of Marina Dodero. Ms. Onassis'
first four marriages ended in divorce.
   Family members declined to comment. ``I know nothing about that
(wedding),'' said Alberto Dodero, Marina's father-in-law.
   The full coroner's report was expected this week. It was unclear
whether the report would be publicly disclosed.
   A determination that Ms. Onassis died of natural causes would
allow the transfer of her body to the family-owned island of
Skorpios off Greece for burial beside her father and brother,
Alexander, who died in a 1973 plane crash.
   Her fourth husband, French industrialist Thierry Roussel, arrived
from Geneva on Monday to help resolve legal proceedings.
   Roussel is the father of Ms. Onassis' only child, 3-year-old
Athena, who will inherit her entire fortune, estimated at $1 billion.
   In Athens, Greece, a source close to the Onassis family said Ms.
Onassis will be buried on Saturday if Argentine authorities releases
her body within the next 48 hours.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Ms.
Onassis' body will be flown to Athens for public funeral service
tentatively scheduled for Friday. Roussel is expected to accompany
the body, the source said.
   The source said Ms. Onassis' daughter Athena would probably not
be flown from Switzerland for the funeral.
   The public will be able to pay respects to Ms. Onassis in a Greek
Orthodox church in the Athens suburb of Nea Smirni. On Saturday, the
body is to be flown to northwest Greece, where it will be placed
aboard a launch for the short trip to Skorpios, said the source.
   The burial service on Skorpios ``will be strictly private, with
only relatives and very close friends in attendance,'' said Ioannis
Georgakis, a business advisor to the Onassis family.
   Ms. Onassis will be buried next to her father and brother in a
mausoleum adjoining a tiny chapel on a hill in the center of the
island.
   Aristotle Onassis died in Paris in 1975.

   One of the seven bodies found buried
outside a boardinghouse was identified as that of an alcoholic who
spent most of his life on the streets, but authorities don't know
how he or the others died.
   The body of Benjamin Fink, 60, a former resident of Dorothea
Puente's Victorian boardinghouse in downtown Sacramento, was
identified Monday through fingerprints, said Sacramento County
Coroner Charles Simmons.
   No further information was released on Fink. His brother, Robert,
told reporters last week that Fink had been a chronic alcoholic
since age 17 who spent most of his life on the streets in
Sacramento, and had moved into the Puente boardinghouse earlier this
year.
   Puente, 59, remained in jail without bail on a murder charge.
Authorities said they expected to file further charges soon.
   In sworn statements filed Monday in Sacramento Municipal Court,
police said that searches of the boardinghouse have turned up carpet
stained with blood and a handwritten book that may be Puente's diary.
   During two searches of the two-story, wood-frame house, police
seized papers, photographs and books, including a paperback titled
``The Smell of Evil,'' according to the court documents. Among the
seized papers are some ``pertaining to funeral plots.''
   Police Detective Les Murphy said last week in an affidavit to
support a warrant to search the house for a second time that a
former boardinghouse tenant told investigators Puente kept a
personal biography inside the house. Court documents don't say who
owns the handwritten book seized by police.
   The statements filed Monday to show what was found as a result of
the searches, the first Nov. 15 and the second over last weekend.
   Murphy said blood and body fluids found on carpeting during the
first search appear ``to be similar to carpeting recovered from one
of the graves of the bodies found in the yard.''
   Simmons said his office had completed autopsies on six of the
seven victims and would finish the seventh autopsy today. He said a
final report including toxicology studies would not be completed
until sometime next week.
   Despite the extreme decomposition of most of the bodies, good
fingerprints were obtained from at least three and there are still
``better than 50-50 chances'' of determining the cause of death, the
coroner said.
   The sixth victim, whose autopsy was completed Monday, was a woman
more than 50 years old whose body was fully dressed and wrapped in a
sheet, Simmons said. He said she had been buried for ``several
months, at least.''
   With the seventh autopsy pending, that brings the victim total to
three men and three women.
   Simmons said authorities working from a list of about 25 missing
people known to have lived in Puente's home at one time or another
have found six or seven people, and removed them from the list.
   Detectives say they believe Puente killed elderly boarders and
hid their bodies in order to collect their Social Security checks.
   In a television interview after her arrest Wednesday, she said
she didn't kill anyone, but admitted ``the checks I cashed, yes.''

   Environmental Protection Administration chief
Lee Thomas said today he will leave the agency on Jan. 20 when the
new president takes office.
   Thomas, administrator since January 1985, did not say in his
announcement what his plans were. In a recent interview, however, he
said he did not know what he would do when he leaves.
   There had been speculation that President-elect George Bush would
ask Thomas to stay, but Thomas' associates have been discouraging
such talk.
   Thomas was associate director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency when he was assigned to coordinate the federal government's
1982 buyout of homes at Times Beach, Mo., a town contaminated by
dioxin.
   His performance won him a transfer to EPA to bolster the sagging
Superfund toxic waste cleanup program the next year. Shortly after
his arrival, he was tapped to succeed Rita Lavelle as assistant
administrator overseeing Superfund when she resigned amid
accusations of lying to Congress. She later served a prison term.
   William Ruckelshaus recommended Thomas as his successor when he
left the top job in the agency in December 1984.

<HEAD>California Insurers Seek Exemptions From Proposition 103</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven insurance companies, including five of
California's 10 biggest auto insurers, have requested exemptions
from rate cuts mandated by Proposition 103, state officials reported.
   Department of Insurance officials identified the 11 companies,
but declined to release copies of the exemption requests.
   Proposition 103 mandates that such copies be made public, but
Reid McClaran, staff attorney for the State Department of Insurance,
said Monday that the law is not in effect because it has been stayed
by the state Supreme Court pending a review.
   Insurers are eligible for an exemption from Proposition 103's
rate rollbacks if they can prove the reductions will force them out
of business. In addition to seeking exemptions, insurers are trying
to get the entire law thrown out.
   The 11 companies filing for exemptions include Farmers Insurance
Group Co., Northern California Automobile Club (California State
Auto Association), Automobile Club of Southern California
(Interinsurance Exchange), 20th Century and Mercury Insurance, which
are five of the state's 10 biggest auto insurers.
   The other six companies are Williamsburg National Insurance Co.,
National Automobile and Casualty Insurance Co., California Casualty
Group, Contractors' Surety Co., Surety Co. of the Pacific and
Wawanesa Mutual Insurance.
   The decision to withhold information on the filings was blasted
by Proposition 103 campaign manager Bill Zimmerman.
   ``Insurers who have gouged the public for so many years refuse to
accept the will of the people and want to function as if the old
rules still apply, which is not the case,'' he said.
   State Sen. Alan Robbins, chairman of the Senate Insurance
Committee, said he would subpoena Insurance Commissioner Roxani
Gillespie for the records if she refuses to release them.
   Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Times reported today that Ms.
Gillespie plans to add 300 employees to her 515-member staff and
increase her office's annual budget by $18 million to enforce
Proposition 103 if the insurance initiative is upheld in court. The
initiative allows the department to charge insurers for added
enforcement costs.

   President-elect George Bush said today
that as soon as he becomes president he will name administration
officials to negotiate solutions to the budget deficit and will talk
to members of Congress himself on the problem.
   ``On the first day of my presidency, I will name negotiators to
represent the executive branch in deficit talks with the Congress.
I, too, will be `hands-on' in talking directly with members of
Congress, on both sides of the aisle,'' he told Republican governors.
   He reiterated, however, that the vote in the presidential
election endorsed his stand that ``the solution to the federal
budget deficit is not taxes.''
   The president-elect spoke to the National Republican Governors
Conference in a crowded ballroom of the Grand Hotel resort on the
Alabama coast. The GOP governors earlier had stressed that close
ties already have been formed between the new White House team and
Republican statehouses.
   Bush said the 1990s can be the ``the decade of cooperation'',
with the party offering compassion along with leadership. ``This is
a time for bringing people together,'' he said.
   ``Simply put, I mean to continue what Ronald Reagan and I began
in 1980 _ to stop the flow of power to Washington and return it
where it belongs, to the states. I mean to continue this tradition
because it has worked and because it is consistent with our party's
philosophy,'' Bush said.
   ``I believe all of us share the same goal: a land of limited
government and unlimited opportunity,'' he said.
   Bush called on the GOP governors to work with the administration
``to provide compassionate and responsible leadership. As
Republicans, let's work together, and I mean this, to be the party
of all the people. Our ideas are right.''
   He also touched on themes expressed earlier in the four-day GOP
governors conference by members of the new White House team,
including the goal of expanding the Republican Party at all levels
of government.
   ``My point is that we are on our way to becoming the majority
party in America _ if we don't lose sight of what is driving our
success,'' he said.
   At the start of his speech, he mentioned the conference's host
governor, Alabama's Guy Hunt, who in 1986 became the first
Republican to win the state's governor's office this century.
   Bush has tapped one GOP chief executive, New Hampshire's John
Sununu, as his chief of staff. And on Monday he said Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, the former Pennsylvania governor who once
was chairman of the GOP conference, will hold the top Justice
Department job in the new administration.
   Sununu and Thornburgh both spoke to the conference Monday,
stressing close relations with the states on a range of issues
including fighting drugs. Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater also
promised a full-scale battle on behalf of GOP candidates at all
levels in his new job as chairman of the Republican National
Committee.
   Atwater told governors that in the last three presidential races
the party has won enough key states and geographic territory that it
``could and should win the presidency right on through the next
century.''
   Sununu said Bush has begun forming his economic team with his
initial Cabinet selections and will be developing a defense team,
probably after a break for the Thanksgiving holiday.
   Atwater, accused by Democratic critics of lowering the level of
the presidential campaign and giving it an element of racial
divisiveness, said the party has ``an opportunity in the black
community,'' which has voted heavily Democratic. In the conference
hall as he spoke Monday there were only a couple of blacks in the
crowd of perhaps 400.
   ``Black outreach is a top priority,'' Atwater said, along with
``Hispanic outreach.''
   As for his own role, Atwater said, ``I'm not going to try to be a
national celebrity. I'm not going to try to be a statesman. That
ain't me.''
   Thornburgh said his office will have a ``full agenda'' in the
Bush administration, which has labeled the drug trade as ``publice
enemy No. 1.'' He said the statehouses are in the ``front line'' of
the fight and that his office will be working with state drug
directors as well as law enforcement personnel.
   Thornburgh also said there must be major change on the demand
side of the drug problem to begin resolving it. He said programs in
the nation's schools should ``make sense'' to young people about
living a drug-free life.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, tapped by Bush to hold his
post in the new Cabinet, spoke to the conference in a session on
education. He stressed the importance of addressing the dropout
problem in America's schools.
   Taking part in the conference sessions Monday were 20 of the
nation's 23 Republican governors, along with two governors-elect.
The GOP suffered a net loss of one statehouse in the November
election.

   A slightly weakened Tropical Storm Keith churned
over the Gulf of Mexico toward an expected Florida landfall after
drenching a stretch from Mexico to the Florida Keys and forcing the
evacuation of 2,500 people in Cuba.
   Forecasters said the storm still packed winds near 65 mph, and
emergency planning officials urged people along Florida's Gulf Coast
to batten down and brace for heavy rains and winds today.
   However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center said a cold
front from the north was mingling with Storm Keith in the Gulf of
Mexico, keeping it from strengthening to hurricane status.
   ``It's extremely unlikely it would strengthen,'' said forecaster
Colin McAdie. ``It will lose strength as it crosses land.''
   Earlier today, Keith's winds were put at 65 mph, but the 11 a.m.
EST advisory from the hurricane center said the winds had slightly
eased, to near 65 mph. Winds would have had to go up to 74 mph for
the storm to be reclassified as a hurricane.
   Tropical storm warnings were extended today from Cape Sable to
Cedar Key on the Gulf Coast and hurricane forecasters issued a
tropical storm watch from Jupiter Inlet to Savannah, Ga., on the
Atlantic Coast. Rainfall of up to 5 inches was forecast.
   ``The outer fringes of the storm are already over them,'' McAdie
said. ``The rainfalls will increase throughout the day, with the
heaviest rains tonight.'
   ``We're advising the public to sit and ride it out,'' said
Stephanie Riley, emergency planner for Sarasota. She said the area
was experiencing strong wind gusts late this morning, and shelters
were being prepared but not immediately opened.
   ``We're going on what the people need, if they feel uncomfortable
where they are or if they get high water or flooding,'' she said.
   Planners advised residents to take stock of emergency supplies of
canned foods, water and candles.
   ``Basically, we're saying there's no life-threatening
situation,'' said David Saniter, emergency coordinator in Fort
Myers, farther south along the Gulf Coast. ``We're going to get some
rains _ much-needed rains _ and some high winds.'' He advised
residents to prepare their houses for a strong storm.
   At 11 a.m. EST today, the storm was centered near latitude 25.3
north and longitude 85.7 west, about 250 miles west-southwest of
Fort Myers. It was traveling northeast at 12 mph and was expected to
make landfall early Wednesday.
   If Keith's winds did reach more than 74 mph, it would be the
sixth hurricane of the six-month Atlantic season, which ends Nov. 30.
   Monday's rains didn't do major damage to Yucatan Peninsula resort
of Cancun, Mexico, which was among the areas hardest hit in
September by Hurricane Gilbert.
   On Cuba, civil defense authorities reported at least 2,500 people
were evacuated from low-lying areas in the island's westernmost
province of Pinar del Rio.
   While still a depression, Keith passed south of Jamaica late
Friday and early Saturday, pouring almost 4 inches of rain on
Kingston in 24 hours. It also dumped rain on Honduras before heading
north into the gulf.
   Tropical depressions are upgraded to tropical storms when their
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Keith reached tropical storm status
Sunday.
   Keith is the season's 11th named storm. Since 1980, there have
been four November hurricanes.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said today the United
States has agreed to give him an entry visa so he can address the
U.N. General Assembly in New York. The U.S. State Department said no
visa was issued.
   Arafat indicated in remarks to reporters that the visa was
obtained with President Hosni Mubarak's help. Speaking after a
meeting with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Arafat also said
more than 50 countries have recognized a Palestinian state
proclaimed last week by the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   ``President Mubarak informed me today (Tuesday) through Dr. Esmat
Abdel-Meguid that the U.S. administration has agreed to grant me an
entry visa so I can address the United Nations,'' Arafat said.
   Abdel-Meguid said last week that Egypt was interceding with
Washington in an attempt to secure a visa for Arafat, head of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said no
visa application has been received from Arafat. He said that if an
application is received, it will be subjected to ``severe scrutiny.''
   On Nov. 10, Redman said the administration would take into
account ``applicable laws and regulations and other pertinent
circumstances'' if a visa request is received.
   Under the U.N. Headquarters Agreement of 1947, the United States
is not supposed to ``impose any impediment to transit'' of people
involved in the United Nations on official business.
   On the other hand, Congress has authorized the denial of visas to
supporters of terrorism.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz has told Congress that he had
``no desire whatever to see Arafat in the United States.'' He made
the comment in a letter responding to a request from 51 senators to
deny Arafat a visa.
   State Department officials indicated, however, that Egypt and
other moderate Arab states had asked the United States to grant
Arafat a visa.
   The officials said the United States had not given Egypt or any
of the others any indication that it would respond favorably to
their request.
   Arafat did not specify a date for his second address to the
General Assembly. His first address, in 1974, followed U.N.
acceptance of the Palestine Liberation Organization as an official
observer.
   Egypt's state-owned Middle East News Agency, in a report from
Tunisia's capital, Tunis, quoted Emad Shakkour, an adviser to
Arafat, as saying the PLO leader planned to address the General
Assembly on Nov. 29 or Dec. 1.
   Arafat also said 54 countries so far have recognized the PLO's
newly proclaimed independent Palestinian state ``and I am very happy
with the worldwide response.''
   The Palestine National Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile,
last week proclaimed an independent Palestinian state in the
Israeli-occuped West Bank and Gaza Strip. The council, meeting in
Algiers, Algeria, also voted to accept U.N. Resolution 242, which
implies recognition of Israel.
   U.S. policy since 1975 has been not to deal with the PLO until it
explicitly recognizes Israel and renounces terrorism.
   Speaking at the closing session of a seminar on ``the protection
of religious holy places and culture in Palestine,'' Arafat
challenged the Israeli government to take steps to help bring a just
and comprehensive peace to the Middle East.
   Wearing his usual green military fatigues and black-and-white
checked head scarf, Arafat told an audience of several hundred:
   ``We believe in Islam, Christianity and Judaism. In the holy
land, the (Palestinian) children and the women before the men fight
to defend true Judaism, not the religion which the military Zionists
have mutilated.''
   About 1.5 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza,
which Israel seized from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East
war. At least 314 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have died in an
11-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation in the
territories.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission today
defended its efforts to rid the market of toys that can be dangerous
to children, one day after a consumer group accused the commission
of ``pitiful ineptitude.''
   ``I clearly don't agree with their allegations. We spend 12
months out of every year trying to address toy safety,'' said Anne
Graham, commissioner of the safety commission.
   ``On the other hand, I'm appreciative of the ADA for bringing the
toys that they're concerned about to our attention. Our compliance
unit will be looking at them immediately and determining if they're
safe or not. If they're not, we'll take measures to get them off the
market,'' she said.
   The Consumer Affairs Committee of the Americans for Democratic
Action issued its 17th annual report on Monday and criticized the
commission, the federal agency charged with overseeing consumer
goods.
   A ``major reason for the abundance of dangerous toys'' is ``the
pitiful ineptitude'' of the CPSC, the ADA report said.
   At today's news conference, the commission displayed some of the
toys it had recalled in 1988. It also emphasized that parents should
heed the cautionary labels on some products, including warnings on
balloons.
   The commission said that in the 15 years since the agency's
inception, 115 deaths have been associated with balloons. Some
children have suffocated when they picked up broken balloons,
inhaled the pieces and choked on them.
   Toys caused 131,000 injuries last year, including 105,000 to
children under 15, according to the safety commission.
   Two types of toys to avoid, the ADA said, are baby walkers and
crib gyms. The walkers can tip over or fall down stairs, while the
gyms are responsible for a dozen deaths and 662 other injuries in
the past five years, the report said.
   Accidents involving baby walkers occur when steps or stairways
are not blocked or doors are not closed, John Preston, a mechanical
engineer with the commission, told reporters at the agency's annual
holiday safety news conference. He encouraged close parental
supervision.
   ``As far as baby walkers are concerned, there aren't any specific
defects,'' Ms. Graham said.
   Commission spokeswoman Elaine Tyrrell demonstrated how a crib gym
could become dangerous for a child who is able to stand, usually
about the age of six months.
   A child could get entangled in the toy which stretches across a
crib and strangulation deaths have occured. She urged parents to
remove the toy once a child becomes more active.
   The commission said parents shopping for children's presents this
holiday season ``must consider the play environment as well as
skills and abilities of the child when toy purchases are made.''
   The ADA report recommended some basic safety guidelines for
Christmas-shopping parents:
   _Look for sharp edges, small parts, projectiles and potential
danger if the toy breaks. Toys with fabric in them should say the
material is flame retardant or flame resistant. Painted toys should
be non-toxic.
   _Read the directions. Avoid toys with instructions that are too
complicated.
   _Consider the child's age. Good toys should not require constant
supervision to ensure safety or correct use. Also, watch for
inadequate or misleading age labels.

Eleazu S. Obinna, a Pan-African studies professor who has been fired
for his alleged involvement in the grade-selling scheme.
   The appeals hearing was expected to continue through Wednesday on
the suburban San Fernando Valley campus.
   Obinna, a tenured faculty member who had taught at the university
for 17 years, and Willie J. Bellamy, a first-year instructor, told
students the only work required for an A grade in the course,
``Field Work in the African-American Community,'' was to sell 20 $5
raffle tickets for the United Crusade Foundation, according to
testimony before Administrative Law Judge Byron Berry.
   The four students said they were not required to attend class or
complete any other assignments. They said they were told proceeds of
the ticket sales would help the black community through work by the
non-profit foundation headed by Obinna.
   ``Obinna told me later we would have other requirements since
someone turned us in,'' said one of the students, LaTonya Carpenter.
   The professor, who has been on paid leave since July pending
appeal of his dismissal, has denied offering grades in return for
raffle ticket sales. His attorney, Francis Smith, declined to
comment on the case Monday.
   Bellamy, who was not rehired after his first year of teaching at
the campus, could not appeal because he was a part-time instructor,
he said outside the hearing Monday. Bellamy also denied the
students' allegations.
   Berry said he expects to announce a ruling in the case in about
two months.

<HEAD>Architect of Angola-Namibia Pact Succeeds After 8-Year Quest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chester A. Crocker, a principal architect of
the agreement to remove foreign forces from Southwestern Africa, has
pursued that objective virtually from the day he joined the Reagan
administration almost eight years ago.
   His perseverence began to pay off this past spring when he
persuaded the governments of South Africa, Cuba and Angola to begin
a negotiating process under his mediation.
   Now, with South African acceptance of a plan approved last Friday
by the governments of Angola and Cuba, Crocker's patience has paid
off.
   The plan basically calls for Namibian independence from 73 years
of South African colonial rule and the phased withdrawal over 27
months of the more than 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's
northern neighbor.
   Crocker has long believed that achievement of these two
objectives could usher in a period of stability and harmony in a
region that has known neither for years.
   Another Crocker aim has been to free the area from superpower
competition, but that goal apparently will elude him. The agreement
does not resolve the Angolan civil war, in which the United States
and the Soviet Union have been arming opposite sides.
   It was no small achievement for an American diplomat to be
accepted as mediator by three countries with which the United States
has relations ranging from poor to non-existent.
   U.S. ties with South Africa have been strained for years and the
United States has no diplomatic relations with Angola. Washington
and Havana have only small diplomatic missions in each other's
capital and disagree on almost everything.
   But Crocker felt all along that his approach offered something to
each participant in the area's protracted struggles and gently
prodded them toward agreement.
   For South Africa, Namibian independence will mean an end to a
long and costly colonial rule by Pretoria.
   For Angola, the withdrawal of South African forces from Namibia
means an end to South African support for anti-communist rebels in
Angola.
   As for Cuba, President Fidel Castro can claim a major role in
extricating Namibia, Africa's last colony, from South African rule.
It also will bring an end, by early 1991, to a foreign adventure
that has claimed thousands of Cuban casualties since Cuban troops
first began arriving in Angola in 1975.
   Crocker, who turned 47 in October, joined the State Department
after administration talent scouts were impressed by an article he
wrote on South Africa policy in Foreign Affairs magazine in 1980.
   He had spent the previous eight years associated with Georgetown
University, the last five of which he served as director of African
studies at the university's Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
   Since then, Crocker has acquired a reputation for, among other
things, durability. While the four other regional bureaus at the
State Department _ Latin America, the Middle East, Europe and Asia _
each have had three assistant secretaries during Reagan's tenure,
Crocker has been the only head of the Africa bureau in that period.
   His scholarly demeanor reflects his long years of academic
pursuits, which include a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University.
At the State Department, he was recognized early on by his
colleagues as one of the few bona fide intellectuals holding high
government office.
   Crocker is married to a Rhodesia native and has three daughters.

   Preschool children asked about the meaning
of Thanksgiving gave some answers that were real turkeys, but they
had clear ideas on how to improve the holiday, according to a
toymaker's survey.
   ``It's a holiday where Benjamin Franklin discovered pumpkins,''
one 6-year-old girl from Denver told the pollsters from Playskool, a
division of the Pawtucket-based Hasbro Inc.
   ``It's when the Pilgrims invited the Italians over for dinner,''
another said.
   And pupils in Denver, at 80 percent, gave the highest number of
right answers of the day care centers surveyed in Atlanta,
Cincinnati, Denver, Los Angeles and Nashua, N.H. Cincinnati, at 60
percent, had the lowest score.
   The September survey of 150 children aged 4 to 6 found about
one-third of them had no idea of the meaning of Thanksgiving, said
Amy Friedland, a Playskool spokeswoman.
   ``The standards were high,'' Friedland explained.
   Another 6-year-old Denver girl, for example, gave the incorrect
answer when she said, ``You eat dinner when its time, you eat lunch
when its time, and then you go to bed.''
   But the children's lack of knowledge didn't prevent them from
suggesting some improvements.
   A 5-year-old Los Angeles girl said she would prefer ``a cake, ice
cream, hot dogs and something to drink,'' to the traditional turkey
dinner.
   The children also suggested french fries and macaroni and cheese
be substituted for mashed potatoes and stuffing, and ice cream and
Jello replace the pumpkin pie.
   The survey, taken by Playskool to get an idea of children's
interest in the holiday, showed differences in who takes care of the
after-dinner cleanup.
   Eighty percent of the children surveyed in Denver said their
mothers did the dishes, while only 53 percent of the Los Angeles
kids said the same thing.
   Forty percent of the fathers in Altanta pitched in, but only 3
percent of dads in Cincinnati helped, the survey showed.
   Maybe that's because the fathers were too full to move. Almost 50
of the children said their father eats the most at Thanksgiving
dinner. Eighteen percent said they had the largest appetites and one
Denver girl said dogs and cats ate the largest share of the turkey.
   ``Most likely from scraps fed under the table,'' Freidland
guessed.

glanced at former Miss America Bess Myerson today as he began
testifying for the prosecution at the corruption trial of his
one-time friend and political ally.
   But Miss Myerson _ the city's former cultural affairs
commissioner, now charged in an alleged divorce-fixing scheme _
stared intently at Koch.
   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney David Lawrence, Koch
said he ``had and has a high regard'' for Miss Myerson, whom he
described as ``very important in the (mayoral) race I won in 1977.''
   Koch said nothing to reporters when he arrived in his limousine
at the federal courthouse shortly after 10:30 a.m. He was
accompanied by his counsel, Hank White, and by mayoral advisor Dan
Wolf.
   He appointed the Myerson as city cultural affairs commissioner in
1983.
   Miss Myerson, 64, is accused of giving a $19,000-a-year city job
to the daughter of the judge who was hearing the divorce of Miss
Myerson's lover, Carl ``Andy'' Capasso. Prosecutors argue that in
return, the judge lowered Capasso's alimony payments to his
estranged wife.
   The federal court trial of Miss Myerson; Capasso, 43; and former
state Supreme Court Justice Hortense Gabel, 75, entered its eighth
week today.
   The mayor's testimony was expected to center on a letter he
received from Miss Myerson on Oct. 19, 1983, explaining the hiring
of Mrs. Gabel's daughter, Sukhreet.
   In the letter, written the day after a newspaper report about
Sukhreet Gabel's hiring, Miss Myerson contended that nothing
improper was done and that most of the decisions in the Capasso
divorce case were already made when Miss Gabel was hired.

<HEAD>Historians Say Spanish Deserve Credit for First Thanksgiving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-three years before the Pilgrims sat
down to their famous feast of turkey in 1621, Spanish colonists held
a Thanksgiving banquet of fish and fowl along the Rio Grande, Texas
historians say.
   ``The people in Massachusetts are probably not going to like the
idea,'' said Sheldon Hall, himself a Mayflower descendant and
president of a group that claims the first Thanksgiving was held
April 30, 1598, south of El Paso. The group plans to recreate the
dinner next April 30.
   ``It's going to create a lot of talk. It's going to create a big
historical correction,'' he said. ``The reaction in Spain is going
to be wonderful.''
   Amateur and professional historians in El Paso, members of the
Mission Trail Association, aren't trying to rewrite history, but
they want to pay the early Spanish explorers and colonizers their
due.
   Their efforts are aided by the detailed records on the journey by
Juan de Onate, who led a 400-member party from what is now southern
Chihuahua state, Mexico, to present-day northern New Mexico, near
Santa Fe. Capt. Gaspar Perez de Villagra chronicled the trip.
   It took the party of 130 men, 270 women and children, and 7,000
head of cattle about two months to reach the Rio Grande and the
mountain pass it flows through that gives El Paso its name. The last
weeks were spent trekking through the vast Chihuahuan desert,
Villagra wrote, and the expedition ran out of water five days before
reaching the river.
   ``The horses suffered most, poor dumb brutes; they were almost
frantic with thirst, and their eyes nearly bulged from their
sockets,'' Villagra wrote 12 years later.
   On the morning of the fifth day without water, the party spotted
the river, and Villagra wrote that men and horses alike plunged in
and drank their fill.
   After 10 days of hunting, fishing and recuperating, Villagra
wrote, ``We built a great bonfire and roasted the meat and fish, and
then all sat down to a repast the like of which we had never enjoyed
before. We were happy that our trials were over; as happy as were
the passengers in the Ark when they saw the dove returning with the
olive branch in his beak, bringing tidings that the deluge had
subsided.''
   The colonists feasted on geese, ducks and fish.
   Dr. W.H. Timmons, a historian at the University of Texas-El Paso,
notes that Villagra's account does not mention a thanksgiving Mass,
``but you know they had to be thankful for surviving.''
   ``It must have been rough going for those gals and those kids,''
Timmons said. ``And I think about those five days without water
before striking the river, and I can understand they were saying,
`Gracias a Dios.'''
   Timmons said he believes Onate reached the Rio Grande 15 to 25
miles south of present-day downtown El Paso.
   The expedition stayed on the river's south bank for about two
weeks before continuing the journey, finally settling near what is
now Santa Fe. During that time Onate took formal possession of the
lands draining into the Rio Grande.
   Hall and Timmons say some people might reject their effort to
credit Onate for the first Thanksgiving because his feast was held
on the south bank of the Rio Grande and not in the present-day
United States. But Timmons says the river later shifted its course
southward in the area _ meaning the banquet did occur on U.S. soil.
   Even if that weren't the case, organizers of the re-enactment of
the feast hope to bring more attention to the Spanish explorers and
colonists in the Southwest.
   ``All this happened before Jamestown was established,'' Timmons
said. ``We had a European civilization before England planted its
colonies on the Eastern seaboard.''

<HEAD>Italian Parliament in Uproar: Who Used What?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The talk in Parliament these days is drugs _ not so
much the proposals for a new law, but the smoking and the sniffing
reportedly done by the members themselves.
   This week's issue of Panorama, a newsweekly, ran a cover story
titled ``Honorable Mr. Joint,'' which surveyed members of the lower
house and their drug habits, especially whether they had ever smoked
marijuana.
   ``Did I ever smoke joints? And who didn't do it, among my
generation,'' the article quoted a Communist Party deputy, Flora
Calvanese, 34, as saying.
   ``In politics, cocaine also makes the rounds,'' according to
Clemente Mastella, who serves as spokesman for the Christian
Democrats, Italy's dominant party. He made clear he was talking
about others, not himself.
   A furor began when the article appeared. Politicians were
incensed not only over knowing who used drugs and who didn't, but
about those who talked.
   ``I only answered the question,'' a defensive Mastella was quoted
as saying in Tuesday's La Repubblica, a leading national daily
newspaper, ``and I didn't believe that the drug issue would suddenly
be transformed into a frivolous game, into such gossip over the use
and habits of Parliamentarians.''
   Italy's preoccupation over its drug problem _ aggravated by
all-time highs for overdose deaths and its link with AIDS _ already
had put politicians in controversy.
   Claudio Martelli, the No. 2 man in the rising Socialist Party of
former Premier Bettino Craxi, was taken to task with his appeal to
have no penalties for users of ``light'' drugs such as marijuana.
Craxi had called for a law that would punish users as well as
sellers of drugs.
   One member of Parliament who disapproved of drug use was
Hungarian-born porno movie star, Ilona Staller, known as
``Cicciolina'' to her screen fans. ``No, no joints for me,'' she was
quoted as saying in Panorama.
   ``My drug is sex and I emerse myself in it. If my colleagues did
the same thing, it would be one big, beautiful thing,'' she said.
   Her party, the Radicals, proposed sarcastically that a drug
rehabilitation center be opened in Parliament.

   A passenger train heading from Moscow to a city in
Central Asia caught fire, killing 10 of the 48 people on board,
media reported.
   The train, heading for Kustanay, about 1,000 miles east of Moscow
in Kazakhstan, pulled into the Zayatskaya station just after
midnight Nov. 19 with smoke pouring from the fifth car.
   ``In the ensuing panic, the awakened people rushed to the exit.
Out of 48 passengers in the car three died from carbon monoxide
poisoning and seven perished in the flames,'' Tass said.
   Station and train staff tried to put out the fire, but fire
engines arrived late and the fire spread, the official news agency
said.
   Reports said the fire started in the compartment of the car's
conductor, but did not say what caused it.
   A government commission headed by Kazakhstan's premier, Kadyr
Baikenov, was appointed to look into the fire.

   Police who made a routine traffic arrest
later found cocaine worth $1.2 million in the car, in one of the
largest narcotics seizures in Kentucky history.
   Authorities said the 10 kilograms, about 22 pounds, were found
Monday in a secret compartment under the car's trunk.
   ``There will be a lot of people upset for Thanksgiving,'' joked
Louisville police officer Willie Ball, whose dog sniffed out the
drugs.
   Investigators were still searching today for the driver,
identified as Glenn Anthony Hughes, 32, of Louisville.
   Hughes failed to appear at his arraignment Monday on speeding and
reckless driving charges. A warrant has been issued for his arrest
charging him with trafficking cocaine, said Sgt. Carl Yates, a
police department spokesman.
   Hughes was stopped about 1 a.m. Monday, but he had no prior
warrants and was released on a $90 bond before police found the
drugs four hours later.

   Dozens of people, including seven current
or former policemen, have been accused in a black-market liquor and
currency-dealing ring, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   The ring sold tens of thousands of quarts of vodka at
black-market outlets and bought or sold thousands of U.S. dollars on
the black market, Internal Affairs spokesman Capt. Andrzej Zaczynski
told the Zycie Warszawy daily.
   There also was evidence of corruption of police officers through
bribery, Zaczynski said.
   A chain of state-owned stores sell hard-to-get imported goods and
some Polish products such as better grades of vodka for dollars.
Poles often buy dollars illegally at four to five times the official
rate to shop in the stores or to obtain hard currency for foreign
travel.
   The suspects include five current and two former police,
Zaczynski said.
   Zaczynski told the paper that the investigation was taken up on
the Warsaw police department's own initiative and had been going on
since June.
   Prosecutors will send a formal indictment to the courts by
mid-December, he said, according to the newspaper.

   Five people were killed immediately and 11 others died in
hospitals, United News of India added.
   The village is about 90 miles northwest of New Delhi, near the

   Sikh militants have been fighting for a separate homeland in
Punjab, a prosperous farming state. Nearly 2,300 people have been

   An East German sailor jumped ship
along a canal connecting the Baltic and North seas, the second
crewman to flee the same freighter in less than a week, border
authorities said Tuesday.
   In a separate incident, a 27-year-old engineer from East Germany
managed to slip across the border into Helmstedt, about 60 miles
east of Hanover.
   Authorities in Flensburg, near the border with Denmark, said the
32-year-old sailor from the East German freighter MS Koethen jumped
overboard Monday while the ship was passing through a lock near
Brunsbuettel, at the mouth of the Elbe River.
   The Koethen was en route from Rostock on the Baltic coast to
Cuba, the border service said.
   On Nov. 16, another sailor from the Koethen escaped while the
vessel was making its way through the canal on a return trip from
Cuba.
   In Hanover, the border patrol said the 27-year-old engineer who
arrived in Helmstadt on Tuesday had crossed the border undetected by
East German authorities.
   Dozens of East Germans have made their ways to the West this year
and sought asylum.

<TEXT>
   A $41 million out-of-court settlement
between victims and contractors involved in the 1987 L'Ambiance
Plaza building collapse will be signed next week now that the last
roadblock has been removed, officials said.
   On Monday, federal safety officials said they would drop a record
$5.1 million in fines against five companies involved in
constructing the apartment building in Bridgeport.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Zampano said Monday that the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration agreed to accept a
total of $430,000 in fines, which covers the cost of the federal
investigation into the collapse of the partially completed building
on April 23, 1987.
   Twenty-eight men died in the collapse and 16 others were injured.
   Zampano said that without the cooperation of OSHA officials, a
settlement ``would not have been possible.''
   Last week, Zampano reported that the $41 million settlement had
been reached among the dozens of lawyers, victims, builders and the
city of Bridgeport. The agreement is scheduled to be signed Dec. 1.
   Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman in Washington, said OSHA's
purpose in issuing fines is to ensure better safety practices.
   ``Penalties are important, but $430,000 represents a penalty four
times larger than the largest penalty ever paid to the agency during
the 1970s,'' he said. ``And it is still a significant penalty in
terms of the '80s.''
   Zampano and state Superior Court Judge Frank S. Meadow spent
months mediating discussions among lawyers for the plaintiffs and
defendants in the 200 potential lawsuits that experts said they
expected to result from the collapse.
   It could have taken 10 to 15 years for all the suits to go
through the court system, experts said.
   Under the settlement, the ``willful'' violations of safety
standards for which OSHA cited the five companies will stand. The
companies have agreed to drop their appeals of the fines without
admitting wrongdoing.
   All five companies contested OSHA's original findings and fines.
   The companies and the new OSHA fines are: Texstar Construction
Corp. of San Antonio, Texas, $300,000; TPMI-Macomber, a joint
venture of TPM International of Darien and B.H. Macomber of Boston,
$100,000; Lift Frame Builders Inc. of Elmsford, N.Y., $26,900;
Fairfield Testing Laboratories of Stamford, $3,000; and Preforce
Corp. of New York City, $100.
   Originally, both Texstar and TPMI-Macomber were fined $2.5
million; Lift Frame was fined $104,000; Fairfield Testing
Laboratories, $10,000; and Preforce, $1,000.
   Texstar said in a statement that it agreed to the settlement
``based on its concern for the victims and at the urging of the
mediation panel.''
   John A. Pendergrass, assistant secretary of labor for OSHA, said
the agency's investigation of the five found ``serious disregard for
basic, fundamental engineering practices _ a factor directly related
to the cause of the collapse.''
   Pendergrass said the companies ignored two earlier failures of a
construction system, called the lift-slab method, used at L'Ambiance
Plaza, in which precast concrete floors are hoisted into place.

   The active-duty strength of the nation's armed
forces dropped by almost 8,000 last month as a major reduction in
the size of the U.S. military continued.
   The new strength total as of Oct. 31 was almost 42,000 fewer than
a year ago.
   All told, the Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force reported
2,130,216 men and women on active duty as of Oct. 31. That compares
with 2,138,213 on Sept. 30 and 2,172,184 on Oct. 31, 1987.
   The reduction was ordered nine months ago for budgetary reasons.
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has set a combined strength goal
of 2,138,000 for the next year.
   Most of the cuts were made through changes to recruiting goals,
tighter re-enlistment standards and early-discharge incentives.
   Three of the four services reported declines in strength during
October while the Air Force reported a tiny increase.
   As of Oct. 31, the Air Force reported active-duty strength of
576,794, up 348 from Sept. 30.
   The Army said it had 769,369 men and women on active duty, down
2,478 over the month. Marine Corps strength totaled 196,861, down
489, while Navy personnel rolls declined by 5,378 to 587,192.

   Thailand's army chief left Tuesday for
China for talks expected to focus on buying more arms and the
possibility of stockpiling Chinese-supplied arms in Thailand,
military sources said.
   Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was accompanied by navy
Commander-in-Chief Adm. Prapas Krisnachan for the visit during which
Thailand and China are expected to sign a major arms deal involving
sales of 30 Chinese-built tanks, 800 armored personnel carriers and
spare parts, the sources said.
   Also up for discussion is the possibility of setting up a war
reserve stockpile from which Thailand could draw Chinese-supplied
weaponry in event of a threat to its national security. A similar
arrangement has been set up with the United States.
   The Thai military has said arms purchases from China are
necessary to bolster Thailand's defense capabilities against
Vietnamese troops across the Thai-Cambodian border. The Vietnamese,
who invaded Cambodia in late 1978, are regarded as Thailand's main
external security threat.
   Although Thailand buys most of its weaponry from the United
States, it has recently obtained tanks, armored personnel carriers
and anti-aircraft guns from Beijing.
   In July, the navy bought four Chinese-made frigates and is
considering buying small submarines for operations in the shallow
Gulf of Thailand, the Thai newspaper The Nation reported Sunday.
   A commentary in Vietnam's official Communist Party newspaper Nhan
Dan on Nov. 20 attacked military cooperation between China and
Thailand and the support of the two countries for Cambodian
resistance groups fighting the Vietnamese in Cambodia.
   China is the main supplier of weapons to the three-party
resistance forces that include the communist Khmer Rouge.
   Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Saroj Chavanaviraj called the
statements ``interference'' in Thailand's affairs, adding: ``To buy
(Chinese weapons) or not is a Thai military decision.''

   The government today announced it
had joined Cuba and Angola in approving a southern Africa peace plan
that would lead to the pullout of an 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.
   The agreement also clears the way to make South-West Africa
independent after 73 years of South African rule.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said negotiations were continuing to
establish a mutually acceptable system for verifying all phases of
the Cuban troop withdrawal, which is expected to be conducted over a
27-month period.
   That timetable would represent a compromise between a Cuban
proposal for a 30-month pullout period and a South African call for
a two-year withdrawal. U.S. officials, speaking anonymously, have
said the pullout probably will begin next month.
   If this matter is resolved, Botha said, the three countries would
sign a formal agreement and the United Nations would proceed to set
a timetable for implementing its plan to hold independence elections
in South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The peace plan, drafted by negotiators in Geneva last week, calls
for a phased withdrawal of the Cuban troops supporting Angola's
Marxist government in a civil war. The government is fighting rebels
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, which is backed by South Africa and the United States.
   Cuba and Angola announced acceptance of the proposal on Friday.
   South Africa, with backing from the United States, has for years
demanded the removal of the Cuban troops as a condition for ending
its rule over South-West Africa, which lies between Angola and South
Africa.
   Botha said his government had told the United States that peace
in the region will be impossible unless the 13-year-old Angolan war
is resolved through negotiations. The Angolan government has refused
to negotiate with UNITA on its demands for a share of power until
free elections are held.
   Namibia, which lies between Angola and South Africa, long served
as a base for South African army raids into southern Angola to help
support UNITA rebels.
   The Angolan rebels have been fighting to force the government in
Luanda to share power since shortly after Angola gained independence
from Portugal in 1975.
   Cuban troops arrived in Angola at that time to back government
forces fighting the rebels.
   South Africa withdrew all its troops from Angola to South-West
Africa in August as part of a cease-fire agreed on in an earlier
round of talks. The Angolan rebels, not a party to the talks, does
not recognize the cease-fire and reports of clashes between
government and rebel forces continue.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, a U.N. spokeswoman said
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar expressed his pleasure
with the news.
   The spokeswoman, Nadia Younes, said that Perez de Cuellar urged
all parties to redouble efforts for a final settlement and allow a
10-year-old U.N. resolution on independence for South-West Africa to
take effect.
   U.N. Resolution 435 sets a one-year timetable for the United
Nations to supervise elections for a constituent assembly in
Namibia, which would draft a constitution and adopt an independent
government.
   U.N. officials said the world body plans to send about 7,500
peacekeeping troops backed by about 2,000 civilian personnel to
supervise Namibia's transition to independence.

<TEXT>
   Marxist Mozambique has decided for the
first time to allow talks with right-wing rebels in a bid to bring
peace to the former Portuguese colony, a church leader said Tuesday.
   The Rev. Filipe Sigue Banze of the Mozambique United Methodist
Church told reporters that a mediation committee of church leaders
has been set up with the blessing of the Maputo government to
contact the Mozambique National Resistance.
   The resistance group, also known by its Portuguese acronym
RENAMO, has been blamed for widespread atrocities, making hundreds
of thousands of people homeless and forcing tens of thousands more
into exile.
   Guerrillas who have been fighting for control of the southeast
African territory for a decade, control most of the countryside and
make it dangerous for civilians to venture out of the capital,
Maputo.
   ``The government believes that since the churches represent many
of the people it is for the churches to establish dialogue with the
destabilizers of the region,'' Banze told a news conference.
   There was no immediate comment from the Mozambique government.
Until now, President Joaquim Chissano's government had refused to
allow any dialogue with the rebels, arguing they are terrorists on
the payroll of neighboring South Africa.
   In recent talks with Chissano, South African President P.W. Botha
pledged that all support for the rebels had stopped.
   Banze said the Peace and Reconciliation Committee was established
by the 17-member General Christian Council of Mozambique under the
leadership of Anglican Bishop Denis Sengulane.
   Committee members first met Chissano in August and got specific
instructions to seek direct talks with the rebels, he said.
   ``We the leaders of the church believe we can carry out that
role,'' Banze said. The first problem is finding the leaders, who
are scattered throughout Mozambique, he said.
   Banze said the committee hoped to report progress in peace
efforts at a meeting with Chissano next month.
   ``We do not know what the atmosphere will be like,'' the cleric
said. ``If it is favorable on the one side we will then speak to the
other side. We have to take it as it comes.''
   Ultimately, Banze said, the committee hoped to get the government
and the guerrillas to talk to each other.
   Banze was among 150 church leaders and human rights activists at
a five-day World Council of Churches conference in Harare on South
African destabilization in the region.
   The guerrrila group was created by the intelligence services of
the Rhodesian government in 1977 to harass black nationalist
guerrillas who used Mozambique as a launching pad for offensives
into Rhodesia.
   The General Christian Council of Mozambique does not include the
Roman Catholic Church, the largest Christian denomination in the
country with about 2 million adherents out of the 15 million people.
Half of Mozambicans adhere to traditional animist beliefs and about
10 percent are Moslem.

<HEAD>Turkeys Spared In Truck Accident Will Be Adopted, Not Eaten</HEAD>

   Forty turkeys spared from the slaughterhouse
by a truck accident are being offered for adoption by animal rights
advocates, who say about half already have been offered retirement
homes in the country.
   But 11 other birds that lived through the crash will play the
traditional role on dinner tables Thursday. Those birds apparently
had been pledged before the adoption idea was proposed, said Pamela
Nielsen of the animal-rights group Creature Comfort.
   After Friday's truck wreck, which occurred on the way to a Waco
slaughterhouse, the local Humane Society took 51 turkeys from the
shipment to the Skyline Alcohol and Drug Treatment Center east of
Austin.
   The center had planned to feed its 60 residents and donate the
remaining birds to the needy, said Kay Tillman, the center's
assistant manager-director. ``We're a non-profit organization,'' Ms.
Tillman said. ``We were delighted to be offered 50 turkeys. That
wouldn't have just provided for Thanksgiving. It would have provided
for Christmas and all next year.''
   But Ms. Nielsen and members of other animal-rights groups gained
a reprieve for the birds.
   Said Ms. Tillman: ``They seemed to feel as strongly about their
cause as we do about ours. We're in the business of helping people.
They're in the business of saving animals. If anyone is that
dedicated to anything, you might as well help them.''
   Ms. Nielsen said she hoped the public would donate food and other
items to the treatment center to make up for the lost poultry.
   People who have offered homes to the birds generally have farms
with other animals, Ms. Nielsen said. She said she's confident none
of the turkeys will be eaten because the adopting parties were
contacted through vegetarians and animal-rights advocates.
   ``They are just being nice enough to let them live out their
lives,'' said Ms. Nielsen. ``It's a compassionate time of year.''
   Ms. Nielsen said she plans an adopt-a-bird program so interested
people can donate food or money to help support the turkeys.
   ``One person can really start the momentum going. We saved 40
birds' lives,'' she said.

   A high school teacher was shot and wounded
today in a classroom at and a 16-year-old student turned himself in
two hours later, police said.
   Police said the Abilene Cooper High School student who had been
sought in connection with the shooting surrendered to Taylor County
sheriff's deputies late this morning.
   The shooting occurred around 9:40 a.m. as teacher Rick Maloney's
history class was ending, officials said. A student pulled a gun and
shot Maloney in the mouth, according to police.
   Maloney was listed in stable, fair condition in the emergency
room at Humana Hospital. He has taught history and physical
education at Cooper since 1981.
   Police were questioning a handful of students who were in the
classroom at the time, officials said.

   Mother Teresa, a perennial favorite in Good
Housekeeping magazine's annual poll of the world's most admired
women, held her No. 1 spot in its 1988 survey, but Nancy Reagan was
edged out of her second position.
   Talk show host Oprah Winfrey moved up two notches from last
year's survey to claim the No. 2 spot and drop Mrs. Reagan down to
third in the magazine's 20th annual poll, the magazine said Tuesday.
Two years ago, the first lady topped the list.
   Margaret Thatcher, Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Jeane Kirkpatrick,
Katharine Hepburn, Corazon Aquino and Phyllis Schlafly round out the
top 10 list, which will appear in Good Housekeeping's January issue.
   The eighth annual most admired men poll was topped by the same
face that was No. 1 in the previous seven surveys: President Reagan.
   Preacher Billy Graham stayed at No. 2.
   The other most admired men, according to the survey were: Bob
Hope, Pope John Paul II, Oliver North, Norman Vincent Peale, George
Bush, Bill Cosby, Tom Selleck and Lech Walesa.
   Magazine readers received their ballots in the September issue,
and some 13,700 were returned for each of the polls, the magazine
said.

   Actress Cybill Shepherd decided she wanted
to buy a townhouse overlooking the Mississippi River, but the
co-op's board of directors turned down the Memphis native.
   ``I tell you, I was so hurt. I couldn't believe this could
happen, particularly in my hometown,'' Ms. Shepherd said. ``You tell
yourself these things don't matter, but it made me feel really bad.''
   Ms. Shepherd said she got word of the board's action last week
through Henry Turley Jr., who developed the townhouses and lives in
the co-op.
   Board members apparently were concerned that Ms. Shepherd did not
plan to spend much time in Memphis, and they worried about who she
might allow to use the home she proposed to purchase.
   But Ms. Shepherd took the refusal personally, as an insult to her
character.
   ``I think anywhere else in the world I could understand someone
not knowing me or knowing the kind of person I am,'' she said. ``I'm
a very upstanding person.''

   ``Moonwalker,'' a 94-minute video celebration
of the weird and wonderful world of Michael Jackson, is being
released early next year.
   The video will be an amalgam of Jackson's musical performances,
his reflections on media pressures and a narrative film in which he
transforms himself into a robot and then a spaceship to battle a
drug pusher named Mr. Big, said CBS Music Video Enterprises.
   The release of the video on Jan. 10 comes at the end of Jackson's
15-month world tour, which was seen by 4 million fans in 15
countries.
   Songs on the video include Jackson's ``Man in the Mirror,'' his
version of the Beatles' hit ``Come Together,'' and ``The Moon is
Walking,'' a song written and performed by the South African vocal
group Ladysmith Black Mombazo.

   Hollywood's legendary cowboy Gene Autry
whooped it up with a host of celebrities at a party celebrating the
film star's Western Heritage Museum.
   Several hundred guests packed the $54 million, three-story Gene
Autry Western Heritage Museum built on a 13-acre site in Griffith
Park to celebrate its formal dedication.
   Mayor Tom Bradley joined veteran Western film stars Roy Rogers,
Dale Evans and longtime Autry sidekick Pat Buttram at the party
honoring Autry and the realization of his dream to build the cowboy
museum.
   Also attending Monday night were former President Gerald Ford and
actor Charlton Heston.
   The facility houses a saddle owned by ``Wild Bill'' Cody, a rifle
owned by former president Teddy Roosevelt, Wyatt Earp's revolver and
a 225-seat theater.
   Bradley and Autry were scheduled to open the museum Tuesday by
cutting a ceremonial lariat with a Bowie knife.

<HEAD>White House Signals Displeasure with Ethics Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The White House is signaling
displeasure with a congressional ethics bill, although officials
will not say whether President Reagan will veto the legislation.
   The deadline for a presidential decision on the bill is Friday,
and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has told reporters that
administration officials are voicing some very adverse reaction to
it. But the principal House sponsor of the legislation said those
objections, as represented b rooted in ``flat lies.''
   Discussing the legislation on Air Force One Monday as Reagan
headed to California, Fitzwater said there has been ``some very
strong opposition y Fitzwater, arefrom Cabinet officials.''
   Reagan earlier this month vetoed a whistleblower bill, at the
urging of Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who complained that
the legislation caused separation-of-powers problems between the
legislative and executive branches and would have made it virtually
impossible for the government to fire anyone. Thornburgh also had
said the bill would have put government agencies in the position of
suing one another.

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects North's Reported Calls for Direct Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Tuesday said it will not
hold talks with North Korea and that the best way to ease tensions
on the Korean Peninsula would be in direct talks between Seoul and
Pyongyang.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States
had not received any communication from North Korea asking for
direct talks, and was relying on news reports of Pyongyang's views.
   An article Tuesday in the official North Korean Workers' Party
newspaper said ``it is impossible to ease the tensions and remove
the danger of war in Korea and to create a peaceful condition for
national reunification without holding (North Korea-U.S.) talks to
solve the matter.''
   But Redman said, ``I don't believe there's any call for that at
this stage.''
   The United States is ``encouraged that North and South Korea are
again dealing with each other'' on improving their ties and
alleviating tenions, ``and that's the proper place for this to
occur.''
   Last week legislators from the two Koreas said they had made
progress in efforts to plan full-scale parliamentary talks between
the two sides.
   Redman noted that the United States had done its part by lifting
some restrictions it imposed on the communist North for its alleged
responsibility in the disappearance of a South Korean passenger
plane last November with 115 people on board.
   At the behest of South Korea, the United States announced last
month that it would allow some humanitarian exports to the North and
informal contacts with official representatives from Pyongyang.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South at the end of World War II in 1945, and the two
sides have remained bitter enemies. The United States maintains more
than 40,000 troops in the South.
   Redman criticized a recent spate of attacks by nationalists on
U.S. installations in South Korea, saying they were
``counterproductive and it's also unnecessary. There are adequate
peacefull channels for dissent now in South Korea'' under the
democratic government of President Roh Tae-woo.
   ``We continue to believe that the vast majority of South Koreans
value the United States as a friend and an ally and want our
security relationship to continue,'' Redman added.

<HEAD>Nofziger Appeal Argued</HEAD>

   Lyn Nofziger's illegal lobbying convictions
should be overturned because prosecutors didn't prove the former
White House aide willfully violated the ethics law, his lawyer told
an appeals court Tuesday.
   The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 only vaguely defines
criminal intent and illegal lobbying contacts so that is it
impossible for a person to know if he is violating the law, attorney
Andrew L. Frey told a panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here.
   Frey contended that the trial judge should have required
independent counsel James C. McKay to prove that Nofziger knew the
issues on which he was lobbying were of ``direct and substantial''
interest to the White House.
   Because there was no proof that Nofziger had this specific
knowledge, he can't be held criminally liable for trying to interest
the White House in issue that concerned his lobbying clients, Frey
argued.
   ``The concept of direct and substantial interest as espoused by
the independent counsel and the court is so incapable of precise and
predictable application as to make the statute unconstitutionally
vague,'' Frey argued.
   Nofziger was convicted earlier this year of three felony counts
of violating the one-year ban on lobbying his former agency by
contacting former White House colleagues within a year of resigning
as President Reagan's political director in early 1982.
   He received a 90-day sentence and was fined $30,000 by U.S.
District Judge Thomas A. Flannery, who allowed Nofziger to remain
free while the case was appealed.
   Nofziger, the first former high government official to be
convicted under the law, is being supported in his appeal by the
American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a friend-of-the-court
brief.
   He is challenging Flannery's interpretation of the legal
requirement for proving criminal intent under the law.
   Flannery ruled the prosecution need only prove that Nofziger
``knowingly'' represented clients at the White House within the
one-year period in which his lobbying was restricted.
   The judge held that proof that Nofziger intended to influence the
White House was also sufficient to convict the former presidential
aide of two counts of illegally sending letters to former
administration colleagues.
   That element was not needed to prove criminal intent in a third
count charging Nofziger attended a White House meeting to urge
continued funding of an antitank plane, the judge ruled.
   But ``the jury was not asked to find that Mr. Nofziger had
knowledge of the circumstances that made his contacts with the White
House unlawful,'' Frey argued.
   Frey maintained because the statute is so confusing, ``all we
have to do to prevail here is persuade your honors that there is
some ambiguity in the law.''
   Richard Friedman, an associate independent counsel, argued that
the prosecution presented sufficient evidence that Nofziger intended
to exert influence when he wrote then-White House counselor Edwin
Meese III on behalf of Wedtech Corp.'s bid for an Army contract, and
Meese's deputy, James Jenkins, on behalf of a maritime engineers
union.
   Friedman also argued that the statute clearly states the
prosecutors only had to prove that Nofziger knowingly acted on
behalf of Fairchild Republic Corp. when he attended a Sept. 24, 1982
meeting with White House staff members on continued appropriations
for the A-10 antitank plane.
   ``The intent of Congress is stated with exceptional clarity in
the conference report'' written before the law was enacted, Friedman
said.
   But two of the panel members, Circuit Judges James L. Buckley and
Stephen Williams, appeared troubled by this argument.
   Buckley asked Friedman to provide more evidence that Congress
intended a broad rather than a narrow definition of criminal intent,
but the prosecutor said he could cite nothing else.
   Friedman also argued that if there was any doubt in a former
official's mind about whether a lobbying conduct was lawful, he
could seek a ruling from the Office of Government Ethics.
   ``Would you recommend a client of yours to go forward on the
basis of that recommendation,'' Buckley asked.
   ``I would recommend my client stay clear. I don't interpret the
law to create a broad safe harbor of lobbying by former officials,''
Friedman said.
   ``It sounds like by your standards that the only safe place to go
is out of Washington for a year,'' said Circuit Judge Harry Edwards.

   A stuffed grizzly bear stolen from the
campus of the University of California at Berkeley two years ago was
back home in its glass case, now equipped with an alarm.
   ``So the next time some students from that small school on the
Peninsula try something, we'll have them in handcuffs, where they
all belong,'' said school spokesman Tom Debley.
   The brown grizzly, which was stolen before the ``Big Game'' with
Stanford in 1986, reappeared Monday morning, chained to a fountain
in San Francisco's Justin Herman Plaza.
   On Saturday, the Cal Bears and Stanford Cardinals tied 19-19.
   The bear was killed in 1960 by a University of California alumnus
who shot it near Mount McKinley in Alaska.
   Band members trumpeted, cheer leaders yelled, and general
cacophony prevailed when the bear was returned.
   ``He is the official bear for the university. We're very glad to
see him back,'' said Peggy Perkins, administrator of the student
union.

   Members of two western Nebraska churches are
lighter as a result of a competitive dieting derby in which they
offered up ``lard to the Lord.''
   Sixty parishioners lost a half ton in the monthlong effort to
``get slim for Him,'' said the Rev. Neal Hail, nicknamed
``Near-Ton'' Neal.
   Hail admitted Monday that his team, the ``First Fatties'' of
Scottsbluff's First Assembly of God, lost the contest after a
weigh-in with the ``Northfield Porkers'' of Gering's Northfield
Church.
   The 41 members on the team from Gearing lost a total of 665
pounds for an average loss of 16.2 pounds per person. The
Scottsbluff squad was just a bit behind, although exact figures were
not available. Hail said he personally lost 17 pounds and some
members lost 20 pounds or more.
   The winners were to be treated sometime after Christmas to an
``All-American Pig-Out,'' with the losing team as hosts.

   Drivers who say, ``Gee, Officer, I
didn't think I was doing anything wrong,'' may not only be telling
the truth this time, they may also get a good deal on a holiday
turkey.
   ``If an officer sees a good driver who is not following too
closely and is driving at a good speed, who's courteous and has good
driving habits, he'll issue a `turkey ticket,''' said Sgt. Robert
Ballinger.
   The certificates, good for $10 off the purchase of a Thanksgiving
turkey, were donated by markets. The program began Friday and
continues through Wednesday.
   In looking for good drivers, police are paying particular
attention to streets where traffic violations and accidents occur
frequently in this city 35 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles,
Ballinger said.
   ``We're having a lot of fun doing it,'' he added. ``I don't know
how effective it is, but the people we're giving them to really
appreciate it.''

   Some were too young to remember. Others recalled
the moments the fatal shots rang out as President John F. Kennedy
rode through downtown Dallas in a motorcade 25 years ago today.
   The city held no official ceremony to mark the passing of a
quarter century since Kennedy's assassination, but hundreds flocked
to Dealey Plaza, where he was mortally wounded at 12:30 p.m. on Nov.
22, 1963, both Monday and today.
   As the hour passed today, there were about 2,500 people gathered
in and around the plaza, most of them on a grassy knoll near the
shooting scene. About 20 people clapsed hands in a loose chain along
the motorcade route where Kennedy was struck down.
   ``We are here because this is an important place in Dallas, an
important place in history, what happened here 25 years ago,'' said
schoolteacher Jean Hill, who was also at the site the day of the
assassination. The third-grade teacher brought about 50 youngsters
today to view the scene.
   She called his death a personal loss, adding, ``I though he was a
representative of an era, more than any one person at that time.''
She recalled that she was very close to Kennedy's car at the time he
was shot.
   Members of the Kennedy family, who have asked people to mark
Kennedy's birthday, rather than his assassination, observed today in
mostly private services elsewhere.
   Several organizations planned remembrances later today at
Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy was taken after being
shot, and the Texas Theater, where Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested
hours after the assassination.
   On Monday, the focus was the memorial that marks the tragic
location: a stone slab inscribed with Kennedy's name and surrounded
by partial walls, about 200 yards from the knoll.
   Ernest Saucedo, 20, of Dallas, hadn't been born when Kennedy
died, but he visited the memorial on Monday anyway.
   ``I just made it my business to come by,'' Saucedo said. ``I just
feel I needed to come by. This is history.''
   Raul Miranda, 40, was in Dallas for a convention when he
remembered the anniversary, and decided to visit the memorial before
returning to Los Angeles.
   ``It's something that I can tell my kids what happened,'' he
said. ``I'm going to tell them that 25 years ago this event changed
the history of the United States, the history of the world.''
   At Parkland, five doctors and nurses who were at the hospital
when the president arrived were to participate in a roundtable
discussion today.
   At the Texas Theater, Dallas-area artists, poets and musicians
planned a series of exhibits and live performances.
   On Sunday, 30 former Green Berets and 150 onlookers gathered at
the Dealey Plaza memorial to remember Kennedy. The members of the
U.S. Army Special Forces wore their berets _ authorized by Kennedy
in 1961 _ as they saluted four wreaths at the memorial.
   In front of a plaque at the plaza lay a small American flag with
a bouquet of flowers, about 200 yards from the memorial and across
the street from the Texas School Book Depository Building.
Authorities say Oswald opened fire from a sixth-floor window there
into Kennedy's motorcade.
   The attention given the 25th anniversary has roused more interest
than usual in the site, said Gary Mead, who drove one of several
tour buses that stopped at the memorial Monday.
   ``They're very much aware of it,'' Mead said. ``They don't want
to miss this part of the tour.''
   Dallas native Darrell Jordan, making his first visit to Dealey
Plaza, spent about an hour Monday touring the area.
   ``I've been watching all of the (television) specials the past
several months and trying to formalize my own opinions'' about what
happened, he said. ``I've been walking all over the place.''
   Jordan said he was disappointed the city and county planned no
formal anniversary ceremonies, but said he thought he understood why.
   ``They (local officials) worked 25 years to try to get the nation
to forget it,'' he said.
   The Dallas County Democratic Party, which had been in charge of
the official observance, last marked the anniverary five years ago.
Since then, it has sponsored ceremonies each May in honor of
Kennedy's birthday.
   ``We got the impression that the family preferred we remember the
happier moment celebrating his birth,'' county party Chairman Sandy
Kress said. ``We think the family was right, and we feel good about
what we're doing.''
   Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and family members including her son,
John, and daughter, Caroline, attended a private Mass at St. Thomas
More's Church in New York City this morning, spokeswoman Nancy
Tuckerman said. They did not plan any public appearances.
   In Runnymede, England, Sen. Edward Kennedy today laid a white
rose at the foot of a British memorial to his brother, crossed
himself and mouthed a silent prayer.
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the late president's sister, visited his
grave and that of her brother Robert, at Arlington National Cemetery
in Virginia and said she hopes people remember ``the high points of
his life, the laughter and the vision.''
   Bob Boynton, a visitor to Dallas from St. Ignace, Mich., said he
was surprised an official ceremony was not planned, but added, ``I
also don't think Dallas should share a guilt complex over this.''
   Jean Weir said she had been in Texas the month before Kennedy was
assassinated, and found it hard to believe the tragic news 25 years
ago.
   ``The people were all so friendly,'' she said. ``I loved the
state. I was shocked to hear it happened there.''
   Mrs. Weir returned with her husband to the assassination site
Monday.
   ``I actually wanted to come say a prayer,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin has agreed to a single luncheon
meeting Dec. 7 between Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush in New York, but
the precise location remains uncertain, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
   Two sites are under consideration, the Metropolitan Museum of Art
and Governors Island in New York Harbor. Reagan and French President
Francois Mitterrand held a discussion of East-West relations on the
island during the celebration in July 1986 of the 100th anniversary
of the Statue of Liberty.
   Governors Island offers some security advantages. American,
Cuban, South African and Angolan diplomats met there last spring
outside the glare of publicity to negotiate over the future of
Angola and Namibia.
   ``It's a tossup right now,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Except for the location, the two sides have
agreed on logistics, he said.
   Gorbachev will meet with the retiring and incoming U.S presidents
after addressing the U.N. General Assembly.
   Reagan and Bush are projecting the meeting as not on the level of
a summit. They are expected to seek confirmation from the Soviet
president that in conducting superpower relations the leaders of the
two countries will continue to stress arms control, human rights and
settling regional disputes.
   Gorbachev is expected to promote the idea of a human rights
conference in Moscow, while the U.S. side is looking for
reaffirmation of Soviet intentions to remove all remaining troops
from Afghanistan by Feb. 15.
   The Soviet leader will remain in New York after the meeting and
do some sightseeing as well as see a group of American intellectuals
at the Soviet U.N. mission, the official said.
   In contrast to the ornate Metropolitan Museum and its art
treasures, Governors Island is a modest Coast Guard base that was
built up with dredge and rock excavated from New York subway
construction.
   It has been a sheep farm, a quarantine station, a game preserve
and the site of a race track. Initially, it was set aside for the
English king's governors in 1698 and later for the governors of the
American colonies. It was converted into a military fortification in
the War of 1812 and remained under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army
until 1966.

   An Amtrak train carrying 138 people hit a
log truck at a highway crossing Tuesday, injuring 10 people and
slicing the truck in half, authorities said.
   ``The train did not derail,'' Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Hare
said. ``We terminated the trip at the site of the crash and
chartered buses for the remaining passengers.''
   The truck was headed into the Louisiana Pacific paper mill when
the accident occurred at the U.S. 51 crossing about three miles
south of Grenada, a central Mississippi town of 20,000 people, said
Grenada County sheriff's deputy James Webb.
   The truck driver, identified as Clayton J. Jenkins, 43, of
Noxapater, ``failed to yield from what we can tell,'' Webb said.
There are no lights at the crossing, he said.
   ``The train cut the truck in half, and that's probably what saved
his (Jenkins) life,'' Webb said. Jenkins was among the injured,
however.
   Hare said the train was headed from Memphis, Tenn., through
Jackson to New Orleans.
   Grenada Lake Medical Center spokeswoman Cathy Smith said seven of
the injured were admitted. A 6-year-old girl was transferred to the
Mississippi Delta Medical Center Burn Center in Greenville; and the
other two people were released, she said. None of the injuries was
described as critical.
   Smith said the girl, whose family did not want her name released,
reportedly suffered second- and third-degree burns when coffee
spilled on her. A spokeswoman at the Greenville burn center said the
girl was in stable condition.
   Injured were eight passengers, a train crew member and the truck
driver, Hare said.

   President Reagan phoned Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today to congratulate Mulroney on his
party's victory in the Canadian parliamentary elections.
   ``In recent years, relations between the United States and Canada
have been marked by cooperative dialogue and a remarkable record of
mutually beneficial achievement,'' Reagan said in a statement
released by the White House press office here.
   Reagan, who is in the second day of a six-day Thanksgiving
vacation at his mountaintop ranch about 35 miles from this seaside
city, said the United States ``looks forward to working together
with Canada to further strengthen the ties of friendship and
cooperation between Canada and the United States.''
   ``In particular, we look forward to the early implementation of
the Free Trade Agreement which, we believe, will be a positive
factor in the economic future of both countries and on the Uruguay
Round negotiations,'' the president said in the statement.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters at a
briefing that Reagan had phoned Mulroney at 11:47 a.m. EST, to
extend ``his personal congratulations.''
   Asked whether Reagan had seen the victory of Mulroney's
Progressive Conservative Party as a reaffirmation of the free-trade
policies pursued by his administration, Fitzwater said ``we wouldn't
try to term (the reasons for Mulroney's victory) ... the Canadian
elections.''
   ``We are hopeful tht the Free Trade Agreement will be implemented
by the (Canadian) Parliament and then that the president will be
able to take the next step, which is to issue a diplomatic note to
put the agreement into effect by January (1989),'' the spokesman
said.
   The agreement was sealed in this country by congressional
approval earlier this year, and it would commence a program of
gradually removing all trade barriers and tariffs affecting the
estimated $160 billion worth of trade between the two countries each
year.
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it is impossible to
overestimate the importance of the Conservative victory and what it
portends for world trade.
   ``The U.S.-Canada trade agreement came at a time when many
countries had to make a choice between either increasing world trade
and overall world wealth or adopting protectionism and attempting to
secure diminishing prospects _ thus increasing poverty in the midst
of potential overall world economic decline,'' Lugar said.
   ``It was vitally important that the election resolution make it
possible for the treaty to be ratified by Canada,'' he said. ``We
know that free men everywhere rejoice with us.''

   As the Air Force unveils its B-2 stealth
bomber with fanfare, a federal inspection team is looking into
health complaints of those who build the nation's other
radar-evading plane, the F-117A stealth fighter.
   The fighter, which has been flying in secret since 1981, is made
partly of fiberglass-like composite materials believed to be similar
to some used in the B-2.
   Some of the people who work with those materials say the
chemicals are making them sick, and the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration has had a team inspecting the top-secret
stealth factory since Sept. 29.
   The inspection, which includes the classified ``Skunk Works''
section of the Lockheed Corp. plant, will continue for several
weeks, Frank Gravitt, OSHA's regional administrator, said Tuesday.
He refused to reveal what had been found, if anything.
   Lockheed says its plant is safe, though it won't discuss the
complaints in detail because of security restrictions imposed by its
customer, the Air Force.
   The F-117A is a different plane from the B-2, made by different
companies in different places. OSHA hasn't any record of similar
complaints at the Northrop Corp. plant that makes the B-2 in
Palmdale, Gravitt said.
   Despite the differences, experts on the secret technology used to
make radar-evading planes say both the bomber and the fighter
undoubtedly make extensive use of composites. By this they mean
lightweight, plastic-like materials, often made by using a flexible
screen as a framework, soaked in a glue-like liquid that hardens to
give a part its shape.
   The process is similar to that of making many boats, though the
materials vary.
   In lawsuits against Lockheed, employees allege that chemicals
whose names they don't know make them nauseous or dizzy. They report
ailments ranging from skin irritation to cancer, and lawyers for the
workers suggest the deaths of five workers from the Skunk Works may
have been caused by the chemicals.
   Although almost everything about the stealth project often is
treated as a deep mystery, OSHA, and presumably, an Air Force team
that also has visited the plant, are looking for garden-variety
industrial safety problems: lack of ventilation or protective gear
for workers; failure to establish safe manufacturing procedures;
insufficient training and safety monitoring of workers, and sloppy
practices by the workers themselves.

   Sen. Edward Kennedy led a group of
people Tuesday to a stone memorial for his slain brother and laid a
single white rose at the marker in a meadow where the Magna Carta
was signed.
   Kennedy traveled without advance publicity to the memorial 20
miles west of London, paid his respects with a handful of friends,
and was gone before other visitors arrived on the 25th anniversary
of the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
   The youngest of the Kennedy brothers placed the rose at the foot
of the stark, oblong memorial stone, crossed himself and silently
mouthed a prayer.
   In Britain and elsewhere in Europe, the anniversary of Kennedy's
death was marked by special television programs and newspaper
articles examining his legacy and the various conspiracy theories
surrounding his murder.
   West Berlin remembered Kennedy with special fondness for his 1963
visit and ``Ich bin ein Berliner'' speech expressing solidarity with
the city. Peter Rebsch, president of the West Berlin parliament,
laid a wreath outside city hall.
   West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen, in a speech Monday night
marking the anniversary, said: ``Kennedy's visit and his speech were
unforgettable. His acknowledgment of Berlin as a symbol of freedom
helped cement the self-confidence of Berliners.''
   Vatican Radio remembered the ``tragic event that shook the world
and that hit at the heart of the American dream.''
   During his visit to Runnymeade, Edward Kennedy was accompanied by
three English friends of the Kennedy family Dinah Bridge, Lady Anne
Tree and Chiquita Astor.
   The Massachusetts Democrat also was joined by Americans James
Wyeth, painter of a celebrated posthumous portrait of the president,
and historical author Larry Collins.
   The weather was clear but freezing cold. As the small party
walked across a field away from the memorial, a supersonic Concorde
jet took off from nearby Heathrow Airport, a brilliant white dart
etched against the blue sky.
   The monument sits in a meadow at Runnymede, where in 1215 King
John signed the Magna Carta, or great charter, which would become
the cornerstone of Western civil liberties. It lies on the side of a
hill, not on the top, to symbolize a life cut short before its time.
   The 5-foot-high stone slab, paid for by public donations and
unveiled in 1965, is inscribed with Kennedy's words from his
inaugural address: ``We shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet
any hardship, support any friend or oppose any foe in order to
assure the survival and success of liberty.''
   Kennedy told The Associated Press the memorial had ``a special
meaning to all the members of the family and I welcome the chance to
come out with some of the close friends ... dear friends of
President Kennedy.''
   He declined to elaborate on his feelings on the 25th anniversary
of his brother's death, saying: ``We think it's extremely important
to celebrate the life of President Kennedy rather than the tragedy.
We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and the hope of his life
rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   Doreen Ramsey, 64, and her 71-year-old husband Eric, drove more
than 100 miles from Bristol to visit the memorial.
   ``We felt as though the world had stopped,'' said Mrs. Ramsey,
remembering the assassination in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963.
   One man laid a wreath, said he was there ``to honor a very great
American,'' and broke down in tears, turning away quickly.

   A public school principal who was arrested two
weeks ago while allegedly trying to buy crack plans to enter a drug
treatment program, his lawyer told a judge Tuesday.
   Matthew Barnwell, 55, did not speak in his five-minute appearance
before Criminal Court Judge Thomas Donati. His lawyer, Philip
Foglia, said, ``Mr. Barnwell's present intention is to enter an
in-patient substance abuse program.''
   Assistant District Attorney Paul Shechtman told the judge that
laboratory analysis showed Barnwell was carrying two vials of
cocaine totalling two grains when he was arrested Nov. 9 near his
home in Manhattan.
   Barnwell, a principal for 16 years at P.S. 52 in the Bronx, was
charged with illegal possession of a controlled substance, a
misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. Shechtman said that
when Barnwell was arrested he told police he was a ``lowly school
aide.''
   Donati scheduled motions for Jan. 10 and allowed Barnwell to
remain free on his own recognizance.

   George Bush and Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the
presidents-elect of the United States and Mexico, arrived in Texas
today for quick, get-acquainted talks before taking the reins of
government in their countries.
   Earlier, Bush told Republican governors at a meeting in Alabama
that he will appoint special negotiators to deal with the federal
budget deficit, and he said to reporters traveling with him that he
hasn't decided on a new defense secretary, despite reports that he
plans to appoint former Sen. John Tower of Texas.
   In Texas today, Bush arrived first at Ellington Air Force Base.
After the Mexican leader's plane landed, the vice president greeted
him with a hearty handshake as he emerged.
   Salinas then joined Bush in his limousine for the short trip to
NASA's Johnson Space Center for two hours of talks.
   Earlier, aboard his plane, Bush told reporters, ``No decision has
been made'' on a new defense secretary. ``The Tower story is not
right,'' he said.
   Bush said he hopes to finish naming top-level members of his team
within a month but expressed mild irritation about ``reading these
stories about what I have decided.'' He indicated the defense job
would not be filled this week.
   In Washington, Kim Garvin, a Tower spokeswoman, said, ``He at
present has not been asked. ... He is on hold.''
   The vice president spoke to reporters traveling with him aboard
Air Force Two to a Republican governors conference in Point Clear,
Ala.
   At the meeting, he told the governors he had not wavered in his
resolve to avoid raising taxes as a way of trying to reduce the
federal budget deficit.
   However, he said, ``This problem of the federal deficit is
pressing. ... On the first day of my presidency, I will name
negotiators to represent the executive branch in deficit talks with
the Congress.''
   He told the 20 GOP governors and two governors-elect at the
meeting that results of the election two weeks ago show that a
majority of Americans ``agree with our philosophy.'' And he said,
```We are on our way to becoming the majority party in America if we
don't lose sight of what is driving our success.''
   Though Bush won the presidency, the Democrats gained one in the
balance of governships, one seat in the Senate and three seats in
the House _ in all of which they hold majorities.
   Before his trip to Texas, Bush said his meeting with Salinas
``manifests the importance that I place on Mexican-U.S. relations.''
   The leaders are expected to discuss the economy, trade, drug
enforcement, and possibly immigration at the private talks and
luncheon at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, according to Sheila
Tate, Bush's spokeswoman.
   Bush also said he welcomed Monday's election victory of Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney with whom he said he had a ``special
kind of friendly personal relationship.'' Mulroney beat back a
challenge from John Turner, leader of Canada's Liberal Party.
   Mulroney's victory ``was most interesting because to a degree it
was a referendum on getting the free trade agreement through,'' Bush
said. A key issue in the election was Turner's opposition to a
Canadian-U.S. agreement to eliminate trade barriers between the two
countries.
   As for Tower's status, Bush campaign sources, speaking on
condition they remain anonymous, say the former head of the Senate
Armed Services Committee is a likely selection for defense secretary.
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, Bush's choice for White House
chief of staff, predicted Monday that Bush would move next to fill
the Defense Department post.
   ``I think the next thing you'll see, probably after Thanksgiving,
is the focus shift a little bit to the defense side, a little
rounding out of that team, and then rounding out of some of the
other major areas,'' he said.
   Bush also said today he had not yet decided whom he will name as
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, although
there are reports he might select Stanford University professor
Michael Boskin.
   Bush called Boskin ``a very good man. He might well prove to be
the economic adviser.'' He added, ``I haven't sat down and talked to
Mike and I want to do that.''
   On Monday Bush named two more members of his Cabinet, reaching
once again into the ranks of recent Reagan appointees to keep Dick
Thornburgh as attorney general and Lauro F. Cavazos as education
secretary. They join Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, another
holdover, and James A. Baker III, the former treasury secretary and
now Bush's choice for secretary of state. He also named Richard G.
Darman as director of the Office of Management and Budget.
   Bush told reporters Monday he would refrain from discussing new
policy initiatives with Salinas or with Gorbachev when the Soviet
president visits the United Nations next month and meets with both
Bush and Reagan.
   ``There will be no new program initiatives'' now, said Bush, but
he promised to make clear ``that I am committed to democracy in
Central America.''
   He said the Sandinistas in Nicaragua ``regrettably have not been
willing to take the steps toward democracy that I find absolutely
essential if we are going to have harmony in Central America.''
   He said he would not make any commitments on ``arms control or
anything else'' when he sees Gorbachev. It will be ``President
Reagan's meeting. I will be there as vice president of the United
States and I expect they'll be aware they're talking to the next
president,'' he said.

   An Amtrak passenger train hit a log truck
at a crossing south of here this morning, injuring 10 people
including eight passengers, authorities said.
   There were no fatalities and the train did not derail. The
southbound City of New Orleans train, en route from Chicago to New
Orleans, carried 138 passengers and crew members.
   The accident occurred about 7:25 a.m., according to Amtrak
spokeswoman Debbie Hare in Chicago.
   In addition to the eight passengers, Hare said, the injured were
a train crew member and the driver of the log truck.
   Cathy Smith, spokeswoman at Grenada Lake Medical Center, said
seven people were admitted, none with critical injuries.
   Two other people were treated and released, she said, and a
6-year-old girl was transferred to the Delta Medical Center burn
center in Greenville, where she was in stable condition.
   Smith said the girl apparently suffered second- and third-degree
burns when hot coffee spilled on her.
   The accident occurred at the U.S. 51 crossing about three miles
south of Grenada, a town of 20,000 in central Mississippi.
   Grenada County Sheriff's Department Deputy James Webb identified
the truck driver as Clayton J. Jenkins, 43, of Noxapater.
   Webb said the truck was headed into the Louisiana Pacific paper
mill when the accident occurred. He said Jenkins ``failed to yield
from what we can tell.'' There are no lights at the crossing, he
said.
   Uninjured passengers were transferred to buses for the remainder
of their trip to New Orleans, Hare said.

<HEAD>Supreme Soviet Session Interrupted by Reports of New Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kremlin's representative in a troubled southern
region interrupted a session of the Armenian legislature Tuesday
because of mass ethnic protests in neighboring Azerbaijan, official
and dissident sources said.
   Arkady Volsky interrupted the Armenian Supreme Soviet and flew
immediately to Stepanakert, the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh
region, which has been the focus of a dispute between the republics
of Azerbaijan and Armenia, said an editor of the official Armenpress
news agency.
   Reports from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, said a crowd of
more than 100,000 people carried banners saying, ``Free the Heroes
of Sumgait.''
   The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported
anti-Armenian rallies in Baku and several other Azerbaijani cities.
   Ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait at
the end of February in which at least 32 people, 26 Armenians and
six Azerbaijanis were killed.
   On Saturday, Armenian activists in Moscow reported that Akhmed
Akhmedov, an Azerbaijani, had been sentenced to death by a Moscow
court for leading a gang that killed seven people during the riots.
   Alexei Mannonikov, an editor with the dissident journal Glasnost
in Moscow, said large protests were reported in Kirovabad and
Nakhichevan as well.
   Mannonikov said a strike at factories and public transportation
was under way in Baku, and that demonstrators had marched to the
Armenian quarter of the city.
   The Armenpress editor said the Supreme Soviet of Armenia had
approved a proclamation officially recognizing a massacre of
Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 be officially recognized by
authorities as genocide.
   Armenian activists said that was important because it laid open
for review a series of historical questions including territorial
matters such as control over Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is a predominantly Armenian area that was made a
part of Azerbaijan in the 1920s.
   The residents began agitating in February for annexation by
predominantly Christian Armenia, leading to mass protests and
strikes in Armenia and counterprotests in Azerbaijan, which is
mostly Moslem.
   Mannonikov said the Armenian parliament adjourned without
discussing a proposal to approve amendments challenging Moscow's
authority over the republic's affairs similar to one approved in
Estonia last week.
   The session was broadcast live on local TV. It considered the
republic's 1989 budget first, and then listened to complaints about
the republic's ecology situation from Deputy Khachik Stambultsyan, a
member of the Karabakh Committee that is pushing for annexation,
said Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan.
   Stambultsyan specifically complained about a nuclear power
station built near Yerevan, the capital of Armenia, that officials
since have acknowledged was constructed on a geological fault. The
drive to annex Nagorno-Karabakh, which began in February, has
spilled over to include complaints about too much control from
Moscow, economic problems and the environment.
   Armenians gathered in the city's Opera Square, where a television
set was broadcasting the session, and outside the Supreme Soviet
building, Popoyan said.
   Moscow has turned down demands to unite Nagorno-Karabakh with
Armenia, opting instead for a long-range financial development plan.
The refusal has not quieted unrest, however, and another strike was
reported in Yerevan last week.

   Israeli warplanes today blasted guerrilla
bases near the southern port city of Sidon, killing six Palestinians
and wounding nine, police said.
   In Jerusalem, a military spokesman confirmed the attack and said
the targets were guerrilla headquarters that served as launching
points for attacks against Israel. It was the 22nd attack on Lebanon
this year.
   Police said fighter bombers rocketed guerrilla bases in the Ein
el-Hilweh refugee camp in four sorties that lasted five minutes. Two
helicopter gunships pounded the camp's western entrance 10 minutes
later, police said.
   Smoke billowed from the camp as the jets and gunships fired eight
rockets, hitting a PLO checkpoint and two guerrilla jeeps, police
reported.
   Three PLO guerrillas were killed in one of the jeeps, said
police. They identified them as belonging to the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, the Marxist group led by George Habash.
The other jeep belonged to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's mainstream
Fatah faction, police said.
   A Fatah gunner was killed when a rocket slammed into a a nearby
artillery base, where a woman and her 4-year-old daughter also died,
police said. Rescuers were searching the rubble for more victims,
according to police.
   Nine others were wounded in the raid on the teeming shantytown
that houses 60,000 Palestinians, the largest among Lebanon's 11
refugee camps.
   The Israeli spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
all the Israeli jets returned safely after making accurate hits.
   The warplanes struck the outskirts of Lebanon's third-largest
city as the country marked the 45th anniversary of its independence
from France.
   Police said smoke billowed from the teeming camp as ambulances
raced from Sidon to evacuate casualties.
   By police count, 108 people were killed and 309 wounded in the 21
previous air strikes since Jan. 3.
   It was the first air strike said the PLO declared an independent
Palestinian state Nov. 15. The declaration came at the end of a
meeting of his movement's parliament-in-exile, the Palestine
National Council, in Algiers, Algeria.
   The last Israeli air raid on Lebanon was on Israel's election
day, Nov. 1.

   Roy Ohse figured his reluctant parrot was
probably talking behind his back, so he rigged up a video camera to
see if he could catch the bird in action while he went to the store.
   But in addition to the parrot's chatter, Ohse's camera recorded
two burglars making off with some of his possessions.
   Fortunately, the camera was not among the items they carried off.
And police used the videotape to arrest the youths and a third
teen-ager, one of whom is awaiting sentencing this week in the May
burglary.
   Ohse, 57, a retired sign painter, said he had been trying to
expand the vocabulary of his 3-year-old African gray parrot for
months.
   ``I figured I'd catch him on a recording,'' Ohse said Monday. ``I
was just curious. I wasn't gone 35 minutes.''
   When he got back, Ohse didn't know he had been burglarized until
he played the videotape to see what his bird had said.
   The burglars could be heard rummaging through things and asking
each other whether they should take various items.
   One distinctly human voice said, ``See anything worth taking?''
Another said, ``You take the bag and stuff and I'll take this.''
   Two teen-agers also passed in front of the camera and their faces
could be clearly seen. At one point, the 13-year-old said to the
older one, ``There's a video camera, you want to chance it with
that?''
   ``Nah,'' came the answer from the background.
   Police said they took a camera, BB guns, a wristwatch,
binoculars, cash and some remote-control cars.
   When Ohse played the tape back, a friend of his 17-year-old son
recognized one of the teen-agers, and deputies arrested Luis
Rodriguez, 18, along with a 13-year-old and a 17-year-old.
   Rodriguez pleaded guilty to a burglary charge and is scheduled to
be sentenced this week.
   The 13-year-old pleaded guilty to burglary charges and was
sentenced to community control, a form of supervised probation. The
third teen-ager pleaded guilty to dealing in stolen property and
also was sentenced to community control.

   Nine log canoes with 18 people aboard
were missing Tuesday on an expedition from the Indonesian island of
Bali to Darwin, the expedition leader said.
   The canoes failed to rendezvous with the ship Alegrias on Monday
at Leti Island, about 300 miles northwest of Darwin, said expedition
leader Bob Hobman, who was aboard the ship.
   The missing crewmen are from the United States, Australia, New
Zealand, France, West Germany, Britain, Japan and Indonesia.
   Hobman said the canoes encountered strong headwinds and were last
seen Monday near Kisar Island, about 25 miles northwest of Leti.
   He said the fleet may have drifted south of Leti and been swept
ashore on the island of Timor, where rebels are waging a violent
anti-government campaign.
   Each canoe carried emergency food supplies, about 2{ gallons of
water and a radio that could transmit across six miles.
   The handcrafted boats left Bali five weeks ago for the 1,000 mile
``Great Junk Race,'' patterned after the voyages of ancient
Austronesians whose small craft conquered the Pacific more than
2,000 years ago.

   A victorious Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today
said Canada had chosen the road to free trade with the United States
and claimed a mandate to enact a controversial U.S.-Canada trade
pact.
   Mulroney, at a nationally televised news conference from his
hometown of Baie-Comeau, Quebec, said Parliament will be called back
into session next month to consider the pact and ``a whole series of
bilateral problems.''
   Mulroney, fresh from the victory Monday, also said he had spoken
to President-elect George Bush and was willing to meet with him
before the U.S. leader's inauguration.
   The Toronto Star, which had bitterly criticized the trade
agreement, said in an editorial that the ``people of Canada have
spoken convincingly.
   ``With this historic mandate, Mulroney assumes an awesome
responsibility: Canadians have put their future and that of their
children in his hands.''
   Voters returned Mulroney to office with 170 seats in the 295-seat
House of Commons.
   He defeated two rivals who based their campaign on oppositiion to
the trade pact Mulroney signed with President Reagan. They claimed
Mulroney's free trade program would subordinate Canada to the United
States and ultimately rob Canada of its sovereignty.
   President Reagan, in Santa Barbara, Calif. for Thanksgiving
vacation, phoned Mulroney today to congratulate him on the victory.
Reagan said in a statement that the free trade agreement ``will be a
positive factor in the economic future of both countries.''
   In Point Clear, Ala., Bush said he welcomed the Mulroney victory,
with whom he said he had a ``special kind of friendly personal
relationship.''
   Mulroney's victory ``was most interesting because to a degree it
was a referendum on getting the free trade agreement through,'' Bush
told 20 Republican governors and two governors-elect at a meeting.
   Figures with 95 percent of the vote counted showed the opposition
Liberal Party led by John Turner with 82 seats, more than double its
40 of four years ago, and the socialist New Democratic Party of Ed
Broadbent with 43 seats, up from 30.
   The popular vote broke down to about 43 percent for the
Conservatives, 32 percent for the Liberals and 20 percent for the
New Democrats, with the turnout at about 75 percent of the 17.5
million eligible voters.
   The Canadian Press news agency said the Conservatives had 5.4
million votes, the Liberals 4.05 million and the New Democrats 2.4
million.
   The Canadian dollar, which had been jittery throughout the
campaign as investors hesitated at a possible Conservative defeat,
surged on international markets to trade at more than 83 cents.
   The Conservatives saw their power erode somewhat in the newly
expanded 295-seat House of Commons. They won 169 races on Monday as
compared to 211 out of 282 seats in the 1984 election.
   Businessmen in Canada and overseas reacted favorably today to
Mulroney's return, the first time a majority government has served
two successive terms since 1953.
   Trevor Taylor, general manager of the Bank of Nova Scotia in
Tokyo, predicted ``a stronger Canadian dollar by the end of the
year.''
   Canadians accepted the ``leap of faith'' that the 10-year deal to
eliminate all remaining trade barriers with their economically
intimidating southern neighbor was good for the country.
   Turner and Broadbent vehemently opposed the trade pact, signed
Jan. 2, saying Canada would be beholden to America. The pact, passed
by the U.S. Congress, requires ratification by Canada's parliament.
   Mulroney predicted his second term would bring ``not just more
prosperity, but more opportunity and security for all Canadians.''
Canada is enjoying a six-year economic boom.
   A somber Turner said in Vancouver, British Colombia, that he had
fought ``with all my heart and with all my strength and I've got no
regrets at all'' for waging the bitterly contested campaign, called
Oct. 1 by Mulroney.
   Broadbent told a half-empty union hall in Oshawa, Ontario, ``It
would not be accurate to say as leader of the party in this
election, this historic election, that I am not somewhat
disappointed.''
   After a jittery start in the four small Maritime provinces of
Atlantic Canada, the Conservatives swept Quebec and did better than
expected in Ontario, Canada's largest province where opposition to
the free trade pact was thought to be strongest.
   They also did well across western Canada, especially in Alberta
where the important oil and gas industry was eager for the deal to
proceed.
   The Liberals did better than expected in the Atlantic provinces,
while the New Democrats turned out best in British Columbia.
   Mulroney has said he would call parliament back into session _
likely by Dec. 12 _ to proceed with the legislation needed for the
agreement to take effect Jan. 1 as scheduled.

   A mugging victim who says she was saved from
``certain death'' when a neighbor shot her two assailants has asked
a judge to be lenient when he sentences her rescuer for an earlier
drug conviction.
   ``I would like to see justice tempered with mercy for this
unselfish act of compassion shown by this man, a total stranger to
me,'' Gertrude George wrote to state Supreme Court Justice Joseph
Slavin in a letter delivered Monday.
   The judge also was given 50 letters with similar messages from
people who know the man, Clovis Fearon, and four petitions
circulated in his Brooklyn neighborhood.
   Slavin is to sentence Fearon, 29, on Monday, more than nine
months after he pleaded guilty to felony charges for ``steering''
two undercover police officers to a drug dealer, who sold them two
vials of crack cocaine.
   The judge had promised Fearon a sentence of one day in jail and
five years probation when he entered the plea in February.
   But Fearon never appeared for his March sentencing and
authorities did not learn his whereabouts until Nov. 2, when he
raced out of his apartment with an unlicensed revolver after hearing
Miss George's screams from the street.
   He shot each of Miss George's assailants once. One, Raymond
Plowden, 25, was found dead a block away, still clutching her
jewelry.
   The other, Timothy Lewis, 25, escaped but was arrested on
robbery, assault and weapons charges at a hospital where he sought
treatment for a gunshot wound to the back.
   ``I was rescued from certain death by a man, Clovis Fearon, also
known as Anthony Dixon, who by coming to my defense revealed his own
past for which he is being prosecuted,'' said Miss George, who was
attacked as she returned home from her job as a nurse.
   After the shooting, Fearon told police his name was Anthony
Dixon. But his true identity was discovered through fingerprints
taken when he was charged with illegal possession of a weapon, the
unlicensed gun he used in the shooting.
   Fearon was ordered jailed by Slavin until his sentencing for the
drug conviction.
   During his time as a fugitive, Fearon was a law-abiding citizen
who held as many as three jobs at once, said his attorney, Paul
Ascher.
   Two of the petitions to the court, signed by about 300
neighborhood residents, urged Slavin to give Fearon only probation,
Ascher said. A third petition was signed by area businessmen and
merchants, and the fourth by about 20 people who work at the
hospital where Lewis was arrested.

   Iran's main opposition group said Tuesday
hundreds political prisoners were executed in Iran this month, some
hanged from construction cranes.
   In the West Azerbaijan province near the Turkish border, 400
prisoners have been executed and buried in mass graves of 10-30
bodies each in a mountain region near the city, said the statement
from Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors.
   The Mujahedeen Kalq said from Baghdad, Iraq, that groups of a
dozen prisoners were executed at Tehran's Evin jail and relatives
lined up every day at the prison gates to search for bodies of loved
ones.
   In Semnan, east of Tehran, eight opposition supporters recently
were ``hanged in public from construction cranes,'' the statement
said.
   In the cities of Rudsar, Arak, Ahwaz and Astara, 44 prisoners
were hanged or shot to death, the statement said.
   In a Nov. 3 report, the United Nations said ``large numbers of
prisoners, members of opposition groups'' have been executed in Iran
since July.

   Two days of torrential rains have
caused floods in eight states, killing 12 and forcing 43,000 people
to flee their homes.
   Rain continued to fall in many areas and authorities issued
warnings to residents of low-lying areas near rivers.
   About 25,720 people were evacuated from Kelantan, the worst-hit
state, where many roads were closed and covered with up to 3 feet of

   Schools were shut throughout the flooded areas, including the far
northern state of Perlis, the southern state of Johore, and the
southern states of Negri Sembilan, Malacca and Pahang.

   The United Arab Emirates
has signed a military pact with France to purchase Crotale
surface-to-air missiles, an army officer said Monday.
   Sheik Khalifa Bin Zayed, deputy supreme commander of the armed
forces, announced the agreement Tuesday at a meeting of senior army
officers, the official news agency WAM reported.
   It did not say how many missiles were involved in the deal.
   United Arab Emirates, which last year purchased 36 French-made

   The deal coincided with the visit of French air force Cmdr.-Gen.
Achille Lerche, who met with Khalifa on Monday.

   Two teen-agers missing overnight in rugged
woods said they built a fire and slept on logs before following a
stream to safety Tuesday.
   ``I'm really glad to be back. I hope that never happens again,''
said Jeffrey Burrows, 15, of Elkins.
   Burrows and 15-year-old Paul Dandevener of Montrose, were found
about 11:45 a.m. Tuesday after emerging from the woods in the tiny
community of Bemis, about five miles east of where they were last
seen.
   The teen-agers became lost Monday while hunting.
   ``We started walking and got into a bunch of laurel,'' said
Burrows. He said both he and his companion were ``kind of scared''
and built a fire that lasted about an hour.
   Despite a heavy frost and a low temperature of 18 degrees, they
slept through the night on logs and set out for civilization Tuesday
morning.
   ``We knew once we followed the Shaver's Fork River we could find
our way back home,'' Burrows said.
   A search party gathered Tuesday morning, and Ray Mearns, a
Department of Natural Resources conservation officer in Elkins, said
he was just about to board a helicopter to begin an aerial search
when he received word that the boys had reached safety.

<HEAD>Consumer Safety Agency Defends Record, Urges Parental Vigilance
With Toys</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission on
Tuesday defended its record on ridding the market of dangerous toys
but urged parents to consider safety when shopping for their
children this holiday season.
   ``While federal authorities have stepped up efforts to intercept
dangerous imported toys at the nation's ports, parents must still
practice safety,'' Anne Graham, commissioner of the safety
commission, told reporters at the federal agency's annual holiday
safety news conference.
   The commission said its joint effort with the U.S. Customs
Service, which was begun in 1987, has resulted in the seizure of
891,000 toys that failed to meet federal safety guidelines between
Oct. 1, 1987 and Sept. 30, 1988 and 162,668 toys since Oct. 1 of
this year.
   But commission officials urged parents to heed the age
recommendations and warning labels on toys, consider their child's
skill level and be aware of the play environment.
   Standing before a display of toys that had been recalled in 1988,
Ms. Graham also responded to charges from the Consumer Affairs
Committee of the Americans for Democratic Action, which on Monday
claimed that the ``major reason for the abundance of dangerous
toys'' is ``the pitiful ineptitude'' of the CPSC.
   ``I clearly don't agree with their allegations. We spend 12
months out of every year trying to address toy safety,'' Ms. Graham
said.
   ``On the other hand, I'm appreciative of the ADA for bringing the
toys that they're concerned about to our attention. Our compliance
unit will be looking at them immediately and determining if they're
safe or not. If they're not, we'll take measures to get them off the
market,'' she said.
   Toys caused 131,000 injuries last year, including 105,000 to
children under age 15, according to the safety commission.
   Two types of toys to avoid, the ADA said in its report Monday,
are baby walkers and crib gyms. The walkers can tip over or fall
down stairs, while the gyms are responsible for a dozen deaths and
662 other injuries in the past five years, the report said.
   Accidents involving baby walkers occur when steps or stairways
are not blocked or doors are not closed, John Preston, a mechanical
engineer with the commission, said at the news conference. He
encouraged close parental supervision.
   ``As far as baby walkers are concerned, there aren't any specific
defects,'' Ms. Graham said.
   Commission spokeswoman Elaine Tyrrell demonstrated how a crib gym
could become dangerous for a child who is able to stand, usually
about the age of six months.
   A child could get entangled in the toy which stretches across a
crib and strangulation deaths have occured. She urged parents to
remove the toy once a child becomes more active.
   The commission said two pamphlets, titled ``Which Toy for Which
Child: A Consumer's Guide for Selecting Suitable Toys,'' are
available to those seeking guidance on what toys to buy.
   One pamphlet is for ages birth through 5; the other is for ages 6
through 12.
   They describe the types of activities children enjoy at specific
ages and the toys they prefer. They suggest types of toys, without
providing trade names, for ``active play, manipulative play,
make-believe play, creative play and learning play.''
   Another pamphlet, titled ``For Kid's Sake,'' recommends that
parents:
   _Keep in mind the child's age, interests and skill level. Look
for quality design and construction in all toys for all ages.
   _Be a label reader. Look for and heed age recommendations and
other safety labels.
   _Keep toys for older children away from younger children.
   The pamphlets are available by writing the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission, Office of Information and Public Affairs,
Washington, D.C. 20207, or calling the commission's toll-free
number: (800) 638-2772.

<HEAD>Calls Glasnost a Stunt, Says Soviets Still Seek World Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger says
glasnost is mostly a public relations stunt, and that the Soviets
are still intent on ruling the world.
   ``I have not yet seen any indication that they have given up
their idea of world domination,'' Weinberger said in an interview
published Tuesday by Jane's Defense Weekly.
   ``I think a very great deal of glasnost is a public relations
exercise on a very large scale and a recognition that the attempts
to change Western public opinion in the past failed, despite their
absolute confidence they could do that _ with peace marches and so
on,'' he said of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
greater openness on selected social topics.
   Gorbachev has tried ``to convince the West that he is a different
sort of person, that he is a Western type of man, that he likes
freedom and democracy and that he would like the Soviet Union to be
more like the West.
   ``It is very dangerous if we believe that.''
   Weinberger was quoted as saying the Soviet military ``has not
been cut back by one ruble'' and ``still keeps growing.''
   On the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, Weinberger told
Jane's: ``They have started to withdraw in a very peculiar way... by
putting in more Scud missiles and more troops, so I worry very much
if they are going to carry out their withdrawal.''

   Israeli warplanes blasted guerrilla bases,
killing six people and wounding nine on Tuesday, the 45th
anniversary of Lebanon's independence.
   Christians and Moslems marched in separate parades in Beirut
marking independence, underscoring fractured Lebanon's partition
into sectarian mini-states.
   As they celebrated, bursts of gunfire and grenade blasts
resounded across the capital when the Syrian-backed Shiite militia,
Amal, and the rival pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, clashed
in gunbattles in south Beirut slums.
   The Israeli raid on the biggest refugee camp in Lebanon killed
six Palestinians, including a 4-year-old girl, and wounded nine. It
was the first air assault since the declaration of an independent
state of Palestine a week ago.
   Police said four Israeli fighter-bombers thundered in on
Palestine Liberation Organization targets on the outskirts of
Lebanon's southern port of Sidon. They staged four rocket runs in
five minutes on a PLO checkpoint at Ein El-Hilweh refugee camp,
police said. The camp of 60,000 Palestinians is the largest of the
11 in Lebanon.
   Two helicopter gunships followed 10 minutes later, police said.
They hit two jeeps racing to help wounded guerrillas at the burning
checkpoint.
   The bodies of three guerrillas from George Habash's Marxist
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine were retrieved from
one jeep. The other vehicle belonged to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's
mainstream Fatah, police said.
   A Fatah gunner was killed when a rocket slammed into a nearby
artillery base, where a woman and her 4-year-old daughter also died.
Rescuers were searching rubble for more victims.
   Guerrillas unleashed a screen of Sam-7 Strella missiles at the
helicopters, but made no hits, police said.
   A Israeli command communique said its warplanes struck targets
serving as guerrilla headquarters and launching points for attacks
against Israel.
   It was Israel's 22nd air raid in Lebanon this year. By police
count, 108 people have been killed and 309 wounded in 21 air strikes
since Jan. 3.
   Syrian troops in Beirut's Moslem sector sent loudspeaker vans
blaring calls for an immediate cease-fire into the embattled slums
of Chiyah and Ghobeiri. There was no quick report of casualties.
``We have not been able to take stock of the losses yet,'' said an
Amal spokesman.
   The fighting erupted a day after four senior leaders of the
fundamentalist Hezbollah escaped assassination by a
remote-controlled car bomb.
   The two factions are vying for dominance of the 1 million Shiites
who form Lebanon's biggest sect.
   In Beirut, Moslem and Christian units of Lebanon's 42,000-member
army staged separate parades to mark independence from France in
1943.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni, and the rival head of
the Christian Cabinet, Gen. Michel Aoun, delivered separate speeches.
   The split celebrations reflected the ongoing political crisis
that has left Lebanon without a president for two months,
threatening to formalize the de facto partition after 13 years of
civil war.
   ``Lebanon is in the throes of collapse,'' said Syrian-backed
Hoss. ``We cannot recover our unity through further dismemberment.
If reunion is difficult, partition is impossible.''
   Aoun lashed out at Syria and Israel as ``occupiers and usurpers.''
   An estimated 40,000 Syrian troops are stationed on 70 percent of
Lebanon's territory under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the
civil war. Israel controls a 6-to-10 mile enclave in south Lebanon
as a buffer zone against cross-border guerrilla raids.

   A 70-year-old man said Tuesday he was
within his rights when he sprayed tear gas on a group of threatening
youngsters, and said he will appeal a judge's order to pay a $100
fine.
   ``These kids came at me with violence and said they had knives
and said they were going to carve out my liver and fry it,'' said
Edward White of Cedar Rapids.
   Associate District Judge Michael Newmeister found White guilty of
assault, a misdemeanor, and fined him the maximum $100 on Monday. A
county prosecutor said an effort would be made to require White to
pay the youths' hospital bills.
   Several of the youths said in court that one boy, who couldn't be
located for trial, had threatened to kill White and that he had a
knife. However, the youths had varied recollections about whether
the threat came before or after White sprayed the group with tear
gas.
   Seven children aged 8 to 14 were taken to a hospital for
treatment of irritated eyes and skin after being sprayed in the
Sept. 18 incident.
   ``I was only protecting myself, and now they say I have to pay
hospital costs,'' White said in a telephone interview from his home.
``Things have quieted down since I put the tear gas on 'em. There
hasn't been any problem next door since then. I guess I settled it.''
   White said he and other neighbors had trouble with neighborhood
children for some time before the incident.
   On the night in question, White and his 94-year-old mother were
sitting on their porch. A group of teen-agers was in the area, and
White said they flew into a rage when he asked them to stop making
so much noise.
   ``The officer said I should have called police, but I know that
wouldn't have done any good,'' White said.
   White said he displayed his tear gas canister and warned the
teen-agers what he would do if they didn't disperse.
   ``I'm not a violent man,'' he said. ``I don't have a gun. I told
'em you either settle down or else. They said, `We got knives.' So I
give 'em a couple of squirts. If you're being attacked, what do you
do?''
   He said that in addition to the threats, the teen-agers struck
him with a rake handle.
   White said he had ``four or five drinks'' before the incident,
but was not drunk.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir renewed the task
of tying together right-wing and ultra-Orthodox religious parties in
a government after talks broke off Tuesday with the left-leaning
Labor Party.
   Shamir's spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said the premier was confident
he could form a majority government in Parliament by next week.
   Other officials, including some in Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc, admitted the prime minister faces a complicated chore and
might have to turn again to Labor, headed by his archrival, Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres.
   Labor halted the talks after being refused two key Cabinet posts,
equal representation in the decision-making inner Cabinet, and
assurances Israel will press for a Middle East peace, Labor party
officials said.
   Without Labor Shamir must please seven small parties and faces
lobbying by American and Canadian Jews objecting to Orthodox dhe current
break-off was partly a bargaining
tactic.
   Shamir is faced with having to form a coaltion government because
Nov. 1 elections to the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, gave his
Likud only 40 seats and Labor 39. The rest went to leftist, rightist
and religious parties.
   In his efforts to attract religious parties, Shamir is becoming
entangled in an argument between Orthodox Jews and the Reform and
Conservative branches of Judaism, which are dominant overseas.
   A dozen American and Canadian Jewish leaders are lobbying Shamir
to reject Orthodox demands for the ``Who is a Jew'' law that would
mean conversions to Judaism would be accepted in Israel only if they
were done by Orthodox rabbis.
   The foreign Jewish leaders, who represent the Reform and
Conservative movements, say the new law calls into question their
Jewishness.
   Ahimeir said Shamir told U.S. and Canadian Jews on Tuesday he
would stick to the promise to put the law before the Knesset despite
opposition by North American Jews.
   ``He explained to them that the matter was a formal, internal
Israeli matter that should not create a rift or misunderstanding
with diaspora Jewry,'' Ahimeir said in a telephone interview.
   The four religious parties submitted the bill to the Knesset
Tuesday, but some Likud members said Shamir will find it tough to
get the legislation approved.
   Meir Shitreet, a Likud lawmaker, told Israel television the law
could cost Israel up to $100 million in annual contributions from
U.S. Jews.

   Lawmakers in Soviet Latvia met today to consider
declaring more self-rule for their republic from Moscow, as
neighboring Estonia did last week in a vote that provoked Kremlin
opposition.
   Latvia's Supreme Soviet convened in the capital, Riga, to adopt a
1989 budget. It was expected this evening to consider constitutional
reforms proposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Mikhail Bonden, who is affiliated with the Moscow-based human
rights journal Express-Khronika, said by telephone from Riga that 50
pickets stood outside the Supreme Soviet carrying signs opposing the
constitutional changes. Many Latvians claim they would reduce the
rights of their republic.
   Deputies from a special legal commission of the Supreme Soviet
national parliament have recommended some changes in amendments
proposed by Gorbachev to limit the powers of a new national council,
which originally would have been able to strike down laws adopted by
legislatures of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Andrei Tsirulis, a Latvian youth newspaper editor, said leaders
of a local grassroots political organization, the People's Front,
asked their deputies to take legal steps ``so the republic will have
sovereignty inside the Soviet Union.''
   Last Wednesday, Estonia's parliament declared itself
``sovereign,'' saying it had the right to override all federal
legislation with the exception of that pertaining to foreign policy
and defense.
   The Supreme Soviet in the third Baltic republic, Lithuania,
balked at taking a similar step Friday.
   Latvia's legislature, whose session was being broadcast live on
two local radio stations, was to vote on the constitutional changes
after considering local economic issues, Tsirulis said.
   ``The entire Latvian people is listening attentively,'' the
editor said. ``The Latvian people support the proposals of the
People's Front and want them adopted.''
   The legal commission of the Moscow-based Supreme Soviet, which
met Saturday, said the Estonian decision to make Soviet laws
subordinate to local control violates the 1977 Soviet constitution.
   They forwarded their decision to the Supreme Soviet Presidium,
the nation's top executive body, possibly presaging a striking down
of the Estonian action.
   Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were independent after the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution until 1940, when they were absorbed by the
Soviets under a 1939 agreement with Nazi Germany.
   In the southern Soviet republic of Armenia today, the Kremlin's
representative to the region today interrupted an Armenian
legislative session because of ethnic protests in neighboring
Azerbaijan, official and dissident sources said.
   Arkady Volsky, sent by the Kremlin to oversee its policy in the
area, broke up the Armenian Supreme Soviet and then flew immediately
to Stepanakert, the capital of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is
disputed by Azerbaijan and Armenia, said an editor of the official
Armenpress news agency.
   Volsky and Armenian officials presumably felt that debate of
several issues pertaining to Nagorno-Karabakh on the agenda of the
Armenians parliament could increase tensions further.
   The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reported
anti-Armenian rallies in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, and
several other Azerbaijani cities.
   Reports from Baku said a crowd of more than 100,000 people
carried banners saying, ``Free the Heroes of Sumgait.''
   Strikes and demonstrations about the demands sparked rioting in
which at least 32 people were killed in the Azerbaijani city of
Sumgait at the end of February and beginning of March.
   The mainly Christian Armenians claim Nagorno-Karabakh is
historically part of Armenia, but was attached to Azerbaijan, which
is Moslem dominated, in the 1920s.
   Moscow has turned down demands to unite Nagorno-Karabakh with
Armenia, opting instead for a long-range financial development plan.

<HEAD>Clothing Costs Power Consumer Inflation to 5 Percent Range</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sharp increases for fall and winter clothing
put consumer price inflation back in the 5 percent annual range last
month despite the smallest monthly increase in food costs since
February, the government said Tuesday.
   Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in October _ or at an annual
rate of 5.1 percent _ with more than half of the gain coming from a
1.8 percent boost in apparel prices and sharp increases in auto
insurance and financing charges, the Labor Department said.
   Inflation had slowed to an annual rate of 4.1 percent in
September as a 1.7 percent drop in gasoline prices offset
drought-caused spikes in grocery prices. Overall cost increases were
held to just 0.3 percent for that month.
   Economists also had anticipated smaller price increases in
October, believing that merchants would not mark up their fall and
winter clothing lines as much after already boosting them by 2
percent in September.
   ``It's still fundamentally in line with an inflation rate of 4.5
percent to 5 percent that we've seen over the past year or so,''
Larry Chimerine, chairman of the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
forecasting firm, said of the overall October numbers.
   Chimerine's view represents the center in a range of opinions
among analysts. Some say the U.S. economy is on the verge of an
inflationary spiral of wage and price increases; others believe it
is nowhere near that danger point.
   Inflation has creeped up from last year's rate of 4.4 percent. It
rose from an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the first quarter of 1988
to 4.5 percent in the second quarter and to 4.8 percent in the third
quarter.
   But the White House predicted Tuesday that inflation will slow
dramatically in November and December to finish the year with only a
4.3 percent increase over 1987, compared with a 4.6 percent annual
rate for the first 10 months.
   For 1989, the administration is forecasting consumer price
inflation of only 3.7 percent, compared with predictions of 5
percent or more by private analysts.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., a New York
consulting firm, said the nation has an ``unacceptable inflation
problem'' even if policymakers do not recognize it yet.
   ``Five percent inflation may be alright for some segments of the
economy, but it induces a greater inflation psychology where it
doesn't take much to push it up to 5.5 or 6 percent,'' he said.
``Any shock _ higher oil prices, a falling dollar, another drought,
higher wages _ can run it up more.''
   Weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.5 percent in October, the same increase as September, the
Labor Department said.
   But in August, they had fallen 1.3 percent, the worst drop in
four years. And even though the $329.81 average weekly pay check
last month was 4.1 percent higher than in October 1987, workers
still had slightly less buying power than they did a year ago, the
department said.
   Price figures for the month showed that the first round of
aftershocks from the 1987 drought, the driest summer in decades for
the country, are about over.
   Food costs rose only 0.2 percent, compared with a 0.8 percent
jump in September. And fruit and vegetable prices fell 1.1 percent
after rising 12.9 percent the preceding three months because of
drought-related shortages.
   Prices for beef, pork and poultry also fell in October, by 0.3
percent, 0.8 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively. Offsetting the
declines was the biggest monthly price increase for dairy products
since December 1980 _ 0.9 percent.
   Cereal and bakery product costs rose 0.7 percent, roughly the
trend of monthly increases they have followed all year and stemming
largely from a drought-induced erosion of grain stockpiles stored
from past surpluses.
   Gasoline prices fell 1 percent in October after the 1.7 percent
drop in September and home heating oil costs were down 3.2 percent.
But a 1.4 percent increase in home electric and natural gas rates
eroded the overall energy savings.
   While crude oil prices have plummeted by more than 30 percent
over the past year, gasoline prices over the same period have
dropped less than 2 percent and home heating prices have fallen only
5 percent.
   Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.5 percent for the month.
   The 1.8 percent apparel cost gains in October atop the 2 percent
increase in September reflected the introduction of higher-priced
fall and winter fashions, particularly for women's and girls'
clothing and shoes.
   ``Those prices are going to give pretty quickly if the past few
years are any precedent,'' said Sandra Shaber, an analyst for the
Futures Group, a Washington economic consulting firm.
   Ms. Shaber said retailers have changed their pricing policies in
recent years, marking up prices more upon the introduction of new
lines and models to ``make the discounts later look that much
better.''
   Sticker prices on new 1989 model autos, for example, are 7.5
percent over comparable 1988 models, the Labor Department said. But
seasonally adjusted new car prices in October were just 0.2 percent
higher than in September, even though '89 models accounted for
one-fourth of the new cars sold in the government's October survey
and none in the September tally.
   Meanwhile, auto insurance and finance charges rose 1.4 percent
and 3.4 percent, respectively, last month.
   Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent, halfway between the
respective 0.4 percent and 0.6 percent increases in August and
September. In the last year, medical costs have risen a total of 6.7
percent.
   The October increases raised the Consumer Price Index to 120.2.
That means a basket of goods costing $100 on average from 1982
through 1984 would have cost $120.20 last month, 40 cents higher
than in September and up from $115.30 a year ago.

<HEAD>Biologists Consider Poster For Missing Whales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal whale biologists may turn to
California tour boat operatiors to learn the fate of two gray whales
that were rescued from the arctic ice near Barrow.
   Jim Harvey, a whale expert at the National Marine Mammal
Laboratory in Seattle, said Tuesday that biologists are discussing
whether to distribute pictures of the whales to tour boat operators
in the hope someone may spot them.
   The primary benefit of such an effort would be to satisfy public
interest in the fate of the whales that were trapped for nearly
three weeks, according to Harvey.
   But he added knowing whether the whales survived may also help
officials make future decisions about whether similar rescue efforts
should be undertaken, and whether techniques developed during the
million-dollar rescue effort in Barrow last month were effective, he
said.
   Even if the pictures were widely distributed, the chances of
anyone ever spotting the whales are slim, said Harvey.
   The pictures, taken in Barrow, consist only of the whales' heads.
In the whales' typical surfacing pattern in open water, only their
backs and tail flukes are visible.
   ``They would just about have to swim up to a boat and stick their
heads out of the water to be identified,'' Harvey said.
   There is also the possibility that the whales may never go as far
south as California where a tour boat industry thrives on taking
people out among the whales.
   Ron Morris, a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist who
coordinated the Barrow rescue effort, said some gray whales stop in
the vicinity of Vancouver, B.C., and San Francisco, rather than
going all the way to the breeding grounds off Baja, Calif.
   ``These could stop too since they're not breeding adults,'' he
said.
   Assuming the whales made it through more than 200 miles of
ice-choked water between Barrow and the southern edge of the ice
pack off Alaska's coast, the whales still have a long way to go
before tour boats have any chance of catching a glimpse of them.
   Based on an average migration speed of 3{ miles per hour, Morris
estimated the whales are still somewhere in the Gulf of Alaska.
   In Los Angeles, the Cabrillo Marine Museum already is training
100 volunteers to be on the lookout when the whale-watching season
begins Dec. 26 in Southern California. The volunteers will be
assigned to various boats, passing out pictures of the whales and
describing their unique characteristics.
   ``It's added excitement,'' said Larry Fukuhara, the museum's
whale program coordinator. ``We'll be copying the photos and giving
lectures, and hopefully we can spot them.''
   However, Fukuhara said whale watchers have been trying since the
early 1970s to spot Chi-Chi, a captured whale that spent a year in
captivity at Sea World in San Diego before being released into the
ocean. Chi-Chi was also marked and branded, but no one has spotted
her since, he said.

   A ditch collapsed Tuesday, burying two
construction workers seven feet underground, authorities said. The
two were presumed dead.
   The unidentified men were digging a sewer line for a housing
subdivision when one side of the trench caved in, said Tammy Brogan
of the Rural-Metro Ambulance Service.
   ``We can confirm there are two victims (buried) six or seven feet
down,'' John Yu, of the Knox County Rescue Squad, said two hours
after the accident. ``We have victims partially exposed at this
time.''
   The victims were working for Blount Excavating, officials said. A
woman who answered the telephone at the Maryville, Tenn., company
said there was no one available to discuss the accident.
   Rescue crews used a backhoe to level out a hill next to the
accident site to keep any more dirt from collapsing. The cause of
the accident was not known.

   A man who said he was angry about crack
dealers going unpunished fired as many 100 rounds from his machine
gun into a suspected drug-infested neighborhood, police said.
   James Harold Wilkerson, 55, was arrested Monday with an AK-47
assault rifle and a .44-caliber revolver after he drove his car into
a ditch during a chase with police.
   ``He was loaded down for big game,'' said Detective Ron Smith of
the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. ``He said he wanted to scare some
drug dealers off.''
   No one was injured, but police said shots were fired randomly
through the Northside neighborhood, where Wilkerson told police
crack dealers were operating openly.
   ``He says the police aren't doing anything about it,'' Smith said.
   Wilkerson, a self-employed merchant, told police that one of his
nine children had become addicted to crack, he said.
   Wilkerson was jailed on charges of possession of a machine gun,
carrying a concealed firearm and resisting arrest, police said.

<TEXT>
   New York state's highest court Tuesday upheld
Bernhard Goetz's conviction for illegal possession of a gun, the
only charge he was convicted of following his 1984 shooting spree on
a New York City subway car.
   The state Court of Appeals said in an unsigned, three-paragraph
ruling that the judge at Goetz's trial, Manhattan state Supreme
Court Justice Stephen Crane, did not make an error in his
instructions to the jury that found Goetz guilty of criminal
possession of a weapon.
   The unanimous decision means Goetz now faces resentencing on the
third-degree weapon charge in state Supreme Court, New York's
trial-level court. The first sentence that included six months in
jail he received from Crane was later overturned by the Appellate
Division of state Supreme Court.
   Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, said officials in that prosecutor's office were
pleased that Goetz won't get off scot-free.
   ``We're gratified that the New York Court of Appeals has upheld
our position in the appeal of this case,'' McKelvey said.
   Barry Slotnick, Goetz's chief attorney, called Tuesday's ruling
``short, not sweet and obviously disappointing.'' He said Goetz's
court fight will continue.
   ``We have a preliminary determination to go to the federal courts
in the continuing saga of removing that one conviction from Mr.
Goetz's record,'' Slotnick said.
   A new sentencing date will be set after consultation with Goetz's
attorney, McKelvey said.

   Accusing some radical Palestinian groups of
cold-blooded terror, a top State Department official on Tuesday
dismissed as ``nonsense'' any suggestion that the Palestine National
Council had renounced terrorism.
   ``It is simply incorrect to assert that by its recent declaration
the PLO renounced terrorism,'' L. Paul Bremer III, who heads the
department's counterterrorism office, said.
   In a speech at a George Washington University conference, Bremer
also reported that terrorist attacks on U.S. targets were running 31
percent above 1987 levels.
   And 1987, he said, was the bloodiest year for terrorist incidents
since the State Department began compiling statistics in 1968. ``We
cannot expect completely to eradicate terrorism. But we can aim to
reduce significantly terrorism's status on the international
agenda.''
   The Palestine National Council, the quasi-legislative arm of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, meeting last Tuesday in Algiers,
declared the establishment of an independent Palestinian state
without defining its boundaries.
   The council also adopted a declaration that the European
Community, among others, subsequently concluded was a renunciation
of terrorism.
   But Bremer said the council specifically endorsed the 1985 Cairo
declaration in which the PLO, while condemning terrorism, also
affirmed ``its adherence to the Palestinian people's right to resist
the Israeli occupation of their land in any way possible.''
   Also, Bremer said, the PLO group endorsed a ``highly
objectionable'' resolution by the U.N. Security Council that ``used
all the code-words terrorists use to justify their acts.''
   For instance, the State Department official said, the resolution
reiterates ``the inalienable right to self-determination'' and
upholds ``the legitimacy of their struggle, in particular the
struggle of national liberation movements.''
   So, Bremer said, while ``some people, some press reports and even
some governments have concluded that in its declaration the PNC
denounced terrorism, this is nonsense.''
   The State Department official said the first immediate concern of
U.S. counterterrorism experts was ``the likely increase in radical
Palestinian terrorism.''
   In May, he said, terrorists from the Abu Nidal organization used
machine guns and grenades to attack a Sudanese hotel and club
frequented by foreign visitors and in July attacked a Greek
passenger ship.
   Last month, Bremer said, West German police arrested members of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command
before they could carry out a terrorist attack.
   Otrher violent and fanatical Palestinian groups recently
proclaimed their intention to step up their terrorism against
Israel, he said.
   ``Combining a deep, visceral hostility to the West with
cold-blooded terror,'' Bremer said, ``these radical Palestinian
groups receive financial, logistical and weapons support from Syria
and Libya. They are responsible for some of the most vicious
terrorist operations on record.''

   The Air Force rolled out its mysterious
B-2 stealth bomber today, taking the cloak of secrecy off a sleek
flying wing designed to evade enemy radar while carrying nuclear
weapons.
   A band played the ``Stealth Fanfare'' and a crowd of guests
cheered as a decade of secrecy ended about the high-technology
aircraft, the crown jewel of the Pentagon's ``black inventory'' of
supersecret devices.
   The boomerang-shaped plane built by Northrop Corp. has a cockpit
flanked by two engine intakes positioned atop its single, continuous
wing. It is light gray on top and black underneath.
   Spectators were kept at a secure distance of 200 feet and were
unable from their vantage point to see the rear of the aircraft. The
plane, rolled slowly out of a hangar at Air Force Plant 42, had
previously been shown only as a rough drawing.
   ``Let all of us remember America's enduring hope and prayer that
the B-2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent
aircraft will never be flown in anger,'' said Air Force Secretary
Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge Jr.
   On Monday, in one of the aerospace company's first public
pronouncements about the B-2, Northrop spokesman Les Daly said that
the stealth ``is simply not comparable to anything ever done before.
It is the first real computer-age aircraft.''
   The aircraft has not yet flown, and the General Accounting Office
estimates it could cost taxpayers up to $68.5 billion if the
Pentagon builds the 132 aircraft-fleet sought by the Air Force.
   The B-1B, the Air Force's most current operational nuclear
bomber, came in around $250 million apiece, before modifications.
Stealth bombers could cost twice that.
   Critics have questioned the need for such a plane and called it a
destabilizing element in arms-control efforts. Gen. Larry D. Welch,
Air Force chief of staff, contends the B-2 will play a vital role in
America's defense.
   The stealth, so-called because it is intended to be extremely
difficult to detect on enemy radar, has been described as a dark,
tail-less flying wing with no sharp angles to reflect radar, and
built of exotic composite materials, some of which will absorb radar
rather than reflect it. Air Force officials say it will resemble a
bird on a radar screen.
   Until earlier this year, Northrop was forbidden even to
acknowledge it was developing the bomber.
   The only previous public view of the B-2 was a drawing released
in April, showing what looked like two wings bolted together with no
fuselage or tail. Sources said some details about the plane's design
were deliberately disguised.
   The public may have seen what it thought was the B-2 in recent TV
commercials by American Honda. A mockup of the bomber sitting on an
airfield with an angry red background looms over a small and sleek
black Honda CRX. The life-size mockup was built for an ad agency
based on the Air Force drawing.
   The plane's real public debut at Air Force Plant 42 didn't reveal
much more detail; reporters and photographers had been told in
advance that they wouldn't be allowed closer than 200 feet, and the
plane was never turned so that anything but the front could be seen.
   Today's ceremony for congressional representatives, news media
and aerospace industry insiders followed by three weeks the
Pentagon's release of a photo of another closely held project,
Lockheed Corp.'s stealth fighter, the F-117A.
   For years, the stealth aircraft have been carried as ``black
programs'' with the Pentagon refusing even to acknowledge their
existence.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said recently that the Air
Force was attempting to manipulate the public's fascination with
technology to build good will for new military spending.
   ``We don't know what's right with stealth; we don't know what's
wrong with stealth,'' she said.
   The Union of Concerned Scientists, a private organization, has
issued a report challenging the need for such an expensive weapons
system, saying that it could destabilize arms control because some
of its missions would include destruction of such targets as command
centers and mobile missile sites.
   However, support for the bomber in military spending committees
on Capitol Hill has been bi-partisan, said the Air Force chief of
staff.
   The Air Force said the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52.
   Even though it has never left the runway, it is one of the most
carefully tested aircraft ever built because of advanced
manufacturing techniques and computer simulations that evaluated how
the aircraft would perform, Northrop said.
   ``We know more about this airplane before it flew than any other
airplane,'' Daly said. ``It is a remarkable aircraft.''
   Flight tests will begin probably early next year at Edwards Air
Force Base, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave
Desert, the Air Force said.

   President Reagan on Tuesday
congratulated Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on his election
victory, saying he thought it would ``further strengthen the ties of
friendship'' between their nations.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Reagan, who is
vacationing at his nearby mountaintop ranch, had telephoned Mulroney
``to personally congratulate him on him on the victory'' of his
Progressive Conservative Party over the Liberal and New Democratic
parties.
   The president said in a statement that relations between the
United States and Canada ``have been marked by cooperative dialogue
and a remarkable record of mutually beneficial achievement'' in
recent years.
   Reagan and Mulroney had got along well personally as well, and
the two men often kidded one another about their Irish ancestry.
   The president said he considered Mulroney's winning 170 of the
295 seats in the House of Commons as a go-ahead signal on the
U.S-Canada free trade agreement, which has been approved by Congress
but must still be accepted by the Canadian Parliament.
   The agreement is aimed at phasing out all barriers and tariffs on
trade between the two North American neighbors, which do about $160
billion worth of business with each other annually.
   Reagan's statement said ``we look forward to the early
implementation of the free trade agreement which, we believe, will
be a positive factor in the economic future of both countries and on
the Uruguay Round negotiations.''
   The latter reference was to the bargaining that the United
States, Canada and some 95 other nations are undertaking, under the
auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to open new
markets and remove trade barriers. A mid-term review of the GATT
negotiations is scheduled to begin in Montreal on Dec. 5.
   Speaking to Republican governors meeting in Point Clear, Ala.,
President-elect George Bush called Mulroney's victory an endorsement
of the free trade pact by the Canadian public. ``That indeed was a
referendum on whether we're going to have more markets and freer
trade, both ways,'' he said.
   Bush also telephoned his congratulations to Mulroney.
   At a news briefing, Fitzwater was asked to say to what extent
Reagan considered Mulroney's victory a vindication of the
president's strong support for the free trade agreement.
   ``We wouldn't try to interpret the Canadian elections beyond the
obvious, that it was an election between two parties, and presumably
general support for Prime Minister Mulroney's policies,'' the
spokesman replied.
   ``We are hopeful that the free trade agreement will be
implemented by the Parliament, and that the president will then be
able to take the next step, which is to issue a diplomatic note that
then puts the two agreements into effect by January of 1989.''
   Mulroney has promised to call the House of Commons into session
as soon as possible to ratify the agreement.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter also expressed pleasure
at the outcome, saying in a statement in Washington that with
expected Canadian approval of the pact, ``we will now have the
largest economic trading partnership in the entire world, making
both U.S. and Canadian firms more competitive with our other foreign
trading partners.''
   ``The free trade agreement will bring prosperity to both
countries for years to come,'' Yeutter said.
   On Capitol Hill, Sens. John Heinz, R-Pa., and Bill Bradley,
D-N.J., also said the victory of Mulroney's party would strengthen
the relationship between the United States and Canada and lend
momentum to opening markets around the world.

<HEAD>South Africa Approves U.S.-Mediated Cuban Pullout Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government Tuesday announced it
had joined Cuba and Angola in approving a U.S.-mediated plan to
remove 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola and set the stage for the
independence of South-West Africa.
   ``The hard nut that had to be cracked has been cracked,'' said
Foreign Minister Pik Botha, whose government for years has linked
the independence of South-West Africa, also known as Namibia, to a
Cuban withdrawal.
   Botha said negotiations were taking place in New York to
establish a mutually acceptable system for verifying all phases of
the withdrawal, which is expected to be conducted over a 27-month
period.
   If this matter is resolved, Botha said, the three countries would
sign a formal agreement and the United Nations would proceed to set
a timetable for implementing its plan to hold independence elections
in Namibia.
   He declined to predict when these steps might occur.
   In Washington, the State Department said it was pleased by the
South African announcement.
   ``With this step, all three governments have signaled their
acceptance of the Geneva understandings,'' said spokesman Charles
Redman.
   He said the way is clear to complete the negotiations and sign
the agreements the parties have said they will conclude.
   Implementation of a U.N. Security Council resolution governing
the indpendence process in Namibia is expected to begin six to eight
weeks after actual signature of the agreements, he said.
   The parties also must work out final details of the U.N. role in
the region and of verification of Cuban troop withdrawal from
Angola, Redman said.
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar also expressed pleasure at South Africa's announcement
and urged all the parties to ``redouble their efforts'' to arrange a
final settlement.
   The U.N. Security Council's Resolution 435, adopted 10 years ago,
outlines a one-year transition period during which elections would
be held for an assembly to draft a constitution for an independent
Namibian government. The U.N. would send about 7,500 peacekeeping
troops to Namibia, backed by about 2,000 civilian personnel.
   Botha said he mistrusted the United Nations collectively but had
faith in Perez de Cuellar, who ensured South African officials
during a recent visit here that the elections would be overseen
impartially.
   The troop withdrawal plan was drafted by negotiators in Geneva
last week. Cuba and Angola announced their acceptance on Friday.
   Cuban troops have been supporting Angola's Marxist government
since 1975 in a civil war against South African- and U.S.-supported
rebels of UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola.
   South Africa, with backing from the United States, has for years
demanded the removal of the Cuban troops as a precondition for
ending its rule over Namibia, which lies between Angola and South
Africa.
   Botha said his government has told the United States that peace
in the region will be impossible unless the Angolan war is resolved
through negotiations. Thus far, the Angolan government has refused
to negotiate with UNITA on its demands for a share of power until
free elections are held.
   Foreign Minister Botha and President P.W. Botha, who are not
related, met Tuesday in Pretoria with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi,
presumably to discuss whether South African aid to the rebels could
continue under terms of the peace plan.
   Asked about this matter at a news conference, the foreign
minister declined to be specific, but said: ``Naturally, our
relationship of good neighborliness and friendship with UNITA has
not ended.''
   Savimbi said last week that President-elect George Bush had told
him U.S. aid to UNITA would continue until the Soviet Union halted
its military aid to the Angolan government.
   Details of the peace plan have not been released. Sources have
said the plan calls for the Cubans to withdraw over a 27-month
period, gradually moving troops northward away from UNITA's
strongholds near the border with Namibia.
   South Africa withdrew its troops from Angola to Namibia in August
as part of a cease-fire agreed to in an earlier round of talks.
UNITA was not party to any of the talks and does not recognize the
cease-fire.
   Many political analysts expect that free elections in Namibia
would be won by the South-West African People's Organization, a
leftist independence movement which since 1966 has waged a low-level
guerrilla war against South African rule.
   The territory is administered by an interim, multiracial
government installed by South Africa three years ago. Parties
represented in the coalition government are expected to form some
type of unified front to campaign against SWAPO.
   Only about 70,000 of Namibia's 1.4 million people are white, but
they have enjoyed special privileges under South African rule. A
final agreement on independence for the territory is expected to
anger conservatives there and in South Africa, where the 5 million
whites dominate the 26 million blacks.

<HEAD>Higher Ceiling Seen For Mortgage Buyouts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ceiling on the size of home mortgages
purchased by secondary mortgage-market agencies likely will rise
from $168,700 this year to $187,600 next year, the government said
Tuesday. That could mean cheaper mortgages, by a quarter point or
so, for many homebuyers.
   The changes must be approved by the boards of the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, and the Federal National
Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.
   Both agencies were established by the government to buy mortgages
and repackage them into securities for sale to investors. The
process is designed to make loans at competitive interest rates
available to home buyers.
   However, mortgages exceeding the limits are considered
``non-conventional.'' They cannot be sold through Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac and financial institutions generally charge somewhat
higher rates because they often must hold them in their own
portfolio.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said the average price of homes
financed by conventional mortgages was $136,900 in early October, an
11.2 percent increase from a year earlier. Under the formula used by
both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the maximum mortgage loan size will
increase proportionately in January.
   The increased limits will be particularly important in the
Northeast and on the West Coast, where average home prices are much
higher than elsewhere in the country.
   Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, said potentially about 350,000 home buyers,
8 to 10 percent of the market, could benefit from the higher ceiling
and save about a quarter of a percentage point on their mortgage
rates. On a mortgage of $175,000, that amounts to $440 a year.
   ``It doesn't knock your socks off, but it helps,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the bank board said the average rate on fixed-rate
mortgages offered in early October, including add-on fees known as
points, was 10.82 percent, down from 10.95 percent in early
September. The average for the most popular type of adjustable-rate
mortgages, those with caps on how high the rate can go, fell from
9.19 percent to 9.13 percent.
   More recently, rates have been rising. Freddie Mac reported
averages, not including points, of 10.31 percent last week, up from
a recent low of 10.12 percent two weeks earlier.
   ``Unfortunately we don't think they've topped out yet,'' Lasko
said. ``We're looking for interest rates to continue trending upward
(by a half to three-quarters of a percentage point) through the
first quarter of 1989 and then move downward.''

<HEAD>Central Committee Chooses Candidate For Premier</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Committee on Tuesday chose a
candidate to replace outgoing Premier Karoly Grosz, who announced he
would resign to concentrate on his duties as leader of the Communist
Party.
   The policy-making Central Committee did not release his name,
party spokesman Laszlo Major said. The candidate first must be
presented to Parliament on Thursday for approval.
   Grosz announced last month he intends to resign as premier by the
end of December in order to concentrate on his position as Communist
Party chief. He was appointed to the post in May and replaced
longtime leader Janos Kadar.
   Among those who have been considered top contenders for premier
were Miklos Nemeth, Central Committee secretary for economic
affairs, and reformists Rezso Nyers and Imre Pozsgay.
   Nemeth, 40, the youngest member of the ruling Politburo,
reportedly is the preferred choice of Grosz.
   Since becoming premier in June 1987, Grosz has set Hungary on a
course of economic reform aimed at reducing its $17 billion foreign
debt.
   Nemeth, like Grosz, reportedly advocates political and economic
changes aimed at developing a market economy and closer ties to the
European Economic Community. He also, however, advocates stringent
austerity measures to counter the $17 billion foreign debt.
   Last month, Parliament adopted legislation to ease the flow of
hard currency into the country and loosen restrictions on
establishing joint ventures with foreign companies.
   On Jan. 1, Hungary became the East European nation to introduce
personal income and value-added taxes, but they have contributed to
the 18 percent annual inflation rate and a drop in personal
consumption.
   Hungarian and Western analysts say the new premier must be able
to rally the country's 10.6 million people as dissatisfaction grows
with inflation, unemployment and sinking living standards.
   Nyers, considered the father of Hungary's economic reforms of
1968, also advocates political and economic reforms within the
framework of a socialistic society.
   Nyers was removed from the ruling Politburo in 1974 after his
economic reforms stalled and was re-appointed to the ruling body in
May.
   Pozsgay, a champion of political pluralism, gained wide
popularity as head of the Patriotic People's Front, an umbrella
organization for officially recognized cultural, intellectual and
trade union groups. He was named to the Politburo in May.
   Other names mentioned as possible candidates for premeir were
Budapest Mayor Pal Ivanyi and Ilona Tatai, head of the Taurus rubber
factory.

<HEAD>ABC's `War and Remembrance' Draws Disappointing Ratings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's 30-hour series ``War and Remembrance''
is not living up to forecasts that it would dominate the Nielsen
ratings, trailing regular series for the week ending Nov. 20.
   Three NBC comedies took the top spots and NBC won the week. One
episode of ``War and Remembrance'' made the Top 10, placing 10th.
   The first 18 hours of the World War II epic based on Herman
Wouk's book was widely acclaimed by critics, but fell in the A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings after its opening night. The first episode was
in fourth place the week before.
   ``War and Remembrance'' is the sequel to ``The Winds of War,''
which got a 38.6 rating and a 53 share over 18 hours in 1983. The
final 12 hours of ``War and Remembrance'' is not expected to be
telecast until May.
   ABC won't comment on the ratings until the final episode of the
first 18 hours is telecast this week, according to Bob Wright, a
vice president for public relations.
   The fate of ``War and Remembrance'' does not bode well for longer
miniseries. The miniseries cost $104 million to make, and even prior
to the disappointing ratings ABC had forecast a loss of $20 million.
   NBC, although it had predicted victory for ``War and
Remembrance,'' won the week by counterprogramming and with vigorous
promotion campaign against the ABC miniseries. ABC placed second for
the week.
   The three NBC comedy shows at the top of the ratings were ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World'' and ``The Golden Girls.''
   ``Our calculated plan of youth-oriented counterprogramming,
coupled with aggressive and creative promotion, had the absolute
right effect with the viewing audience,'' said Brandon Tartikoff,
president of NBC Entertainment. ``I'm happy NBC has kept its
prime-time win streak alive in the heart of the November sweeps.''
   ABC reportedly told its advertisers the first 18 hours of ``War
and Remembrance'' would get an average rating of 20.2. Only the
opening episode has exceeded that so far with 21.8. The next highest
rated episode, Part III, had a rating of 19.9 and a 31 share. Two
more chapters were to be telecast this week.
   Here are the rankings, ratings and shares for three other
episodes telecast this week: Part II, in 11th place, 19.0 rating, 29
share; Part V, 17th place, 17.0, 26; Part IV, tied for 18th place
with NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' 16.8, 25.
   The fifth episode beat Vanna White's debut as an actress in the
NBC Sunday movie, ``Goddess of Love,'' which came in 20th.
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 15.8. ABC was second
with 14.9 and CBS was third with 12.4.
   Each ratings point equals 904,000 homes with television. The
share is a percentage of the sets in use.
   NBC remained in the lead for the season to date with an average
of 15.5. ABC was second with 13.8 and CBS third with 12.3. NBC also
had a good lead in the Nielsens for the November sweeps. The
ratings: NBC 15.4, ABC 13.6 and CBS 12.2.
   Here are the shows in the Top 10: ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A
Different World,'' ``The Golden Girls,'' ``60 Minutes,'' CBS;
``Cheers'' and ``Empty Nest,'' both NBC; ``Growing Pains,'' ABC;
``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; NBC Monday Night Movie, ``Too Good To Be
True,'' NBC; ``War and Remembrance,'' Part III, ABC.
   Fox Broadcasting's ``Married ... With Children'' scored the
highest prime-time rating in the history of the fledgling fourth
network. It got a 10.0 rating and a 14 share. Immediately behind it
was Fox's ``America's Most Wanted.'' Both shows did better than 12
series from CBS and ABC.
   ABC won the week for its ``ABC World News Tonight,'' which had an
11.3 rating. ABC premiered a nightly segment last week called
``American Agenda.'' ``The CBS Evening News'' was second with an
11.2 rating and ``The NBC Nightly News'' was third with 10.5.
   The lowest-rated show other than a Fox show was CBS' ``Simon &
Simon.'' The bottom five were CBS' ``High Risk,'' CBS' ``Dirty
Dancing,'' ABC's ``Knightwatch,'' CBS' ``Raising Miranda'' and CBS'
``Simon & Simon.''

<HEAD>Soviets Lead United States with Unfinished Game Remaining</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union defeated the United
States in the ninth round of the Chess Olympiad on Tuesday, but the
United States is likely to win an unfinished game.
   The Soviet Union, with 27 points out of 35 and one adjourned
game, has amassed a 3{ point lead. England, who defeated Sweden 3-1,
are placed second with 23{ points out of 36.
   A win scores one point and a draw a half.
   The first Soviet victory over the United States came on board
one, when world champion Garri Kasparov, playing white, defeated
top-ranked Yasser Seirawan of Seattle.
   Kasparov has scored a remarkable six wins here, conceding only
one draw. ``I'm a profesional and I'm doing my job,'' Kasparov said
after his victory.
   On board two, U.S. grandmaster Boris Gulko lost to former world
champion Anatoly Karpov. Gulko, who emigrated from the Soviet Union
in 1986 after a seven-year campaign for an exit visa, is
``Grandmaster in Residence'' at Harvard University.
   On board three Joel Benjamin of the New York City borough of
Queens, drew with Soviet Grandmaster Artur Yusupov.
   On the fourth board, however, Nick de Firmian of Berkeley,
Calif., built a strong advantage against Alexander Beliavsky. When
play was adjourned after six hours, de Firmian said he couldn't see
any way for Beliavsky to stave off defeat.
   The adjourned games will be completed Wednesday morning with the
10th round on Wednesday evening.
   While the United States did not repeat its celebrated victory
over the Soviets in the 1986 Olympiad, a win in the adjourned game
will push it into a three-way tie for third.
   Hungary and East Germany share third place with 23 points. The
Hungarians defeated East Germany 2{-1{.
   England, the second seeds, moved into the silver medal position
following victories from Nigel Short, the third ranked player in the
world, and Jonathan Speelman.
   The Philippines, seeded only 29th before the event, continued to
outstrip higher-ranked opposition and moved into fifth equal
position. They lead the Netherlands 2-1 with one game yet to finish.
   In the separate womens championship, Hungary has taken the lead
with 21.5 points out of 27. Their team includes a brilliant trio of
three Polgar sisters, who reject segregated competitions, but agreed
to play here in their first women-only event in a bid to end a run
of Soviet gold medals.
   But the Soviet Union, with 21 points and a favorable adjourned
game against Greece, are expected to regain the lead before the
start of the 10th round.
   The Olympiad, a biennial world team championship, is organized by
the 127-member World Chess Federation and features teams
representing 106 nations.
   The 14-round contest is scheduled to end Nov. 29.

<HEAD>Committee Formed to Investigate Hussein's Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's justice minister Tuesday appointed
three judges to investigate Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son, Odai, for killing a presidential bodyguard last month, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
   In his decree, Minister Akram Abdul Qader Douri also instructed
Public Prosecutor Dari Khalil Mahmoud to lead the prosecution, the
agency said in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia.
   It published the text of a letter which it said the minister sent
Tuesday to Hussein, assuring him that ``justice will take its
course.''
   Douri addressed Hussein as ``the man of great justice.'' But he
cautioned: ``Allow me, Mr. President, to say that my worry is that
you come down too harshly on your son because of your firm
commitment to justice.''
   In a letter carried by state media Monday, Hussein ordered Douri
to investigate his son's killing of Kamel Hana Gegeo.
   Hussein said it took place the night of Oct. 18 when Gegeo, a
trusted Christian bodyguard, was shooting his gun in a private villa
near the presidential palace.
   In an ensuing altercation after Gegeo refused to stop, Odai hit
him over the head with a bat. Gegeo died later in the hospital.
   Odai, 25, is the oldest of five children. Sources in Nicosia said
he has the reputation of a playboy, a regular denizen of Baghdad
nightclubs and discotheques.
   He was known to jaunt to a vacation resort outside Baghdad in his
helicopter _ taking his sports car along to drive while he was
there, they said.
   The sources, who are frequent travelers to Baghdad who requested
anonymity, said Odai fled to Amman, Jordan, after the shooting. They
said King Hussein of Jordan interceded and tried to reconcile father
and son, bringing Odai back to Iraq.
   The Iraqi leader said in his letter that his son has tried to
commit suicide three times, starting when he heard Gegeo had died.
   The bodyguard, believed to be in his 20s, was the son of the
president's male cook and the governess that raised his three
daughters, the Nicosia sources said.
   Odai resigned as head of Iraq's Olympic Committee after the
incident but retained his position as head of the board of Saddam
University, established earlier this year. His appointment at such a
young age was not popular, the sources said.
   The INA report did not specify when Odai's case will be reviewed.
It said the deputy president of the Cassation Court, Judge
Abdel-Wahab Hussein, was appointed chief of the committee that
includes Judge Abdel-Sattar Mohammed Bazarkan, also a member of the
Cassation Court's presidency, and Judge Akram Ahmed Khodar, chief of
Baghdad's Court of Appeal.

<HEAD>Witness Says Radicals Threatened to Blow Up Plane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An American among hostages taken
into Beirut from a TWA jetliner hijacked in June 1985 testified
Tuesday that Moslem radicals threatened to put them back on board
and blow up the plane.
   Allyn Conwell, testifying at the trial of confessed hijacker
Mohammed Ali Hamadi, also said he was convinced he would be shot
when he and others were initially taken from the plane.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is charged with murder and air
piracy in the hijacking during which U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem
was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days.
   Hamadi has confessed to the hijacking but denies killing Stethem.
   Conwell, a 43-year-old Houston executive, said the last 39
American hostages aboard the seized TWA jetliner were taken off the
plane while Hamadi and his accomplice were sleeping.
   He said four American servicemen earlier had been removed from
the plane by Hezbollah, a radical Shiite Moslem group backed by
Iran, while the remaining Americans were in the custody of Amal, a
more moderate Shiite militia.
   As delicate negotiations for the hostages' release ran into
snags, Amal officials told Conwell ``the original hijackers were
getting very upset over the lack of progress in negotiations,'' he
testified.
   ``I was told the intention was to return all the hostages to the
plane and blow it up,'' Conwell said.
   The hostages were shifted around different locations in Beirut
until their release, he said.
   Conwell, who said he had been so ``terrorized that I was
virtually immobile'' after the plane was hijacked on a flight from
Athens to Rome, told the court that conditions improved for the
hostages once they were under control of Amal.
   ``I was under the impression that Amal absolutely did not approve
of the hijacking and the murder of Stethem,'' he testified. ``I
think they acted to the best of their ability in a chaotic
situation.''
   During a break in the court proceedings, jailers could not free
Hamadi from the court security room in which he is locked and had to
use a cutting torch to open the door.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt Airport in January 1987 after
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage.

   The University of North Dakota School of
Engineering and Mines has written to 4,000 alumni seeking
contributions to help give the faculty a raise, the school's dean
said.
   ``I need your help!'' Engineering Dean Alan Fletcher says in the
appeal. ``We do not have the resources to adequately pay engineering
faculty. The future of the Engineering School is at stake.''
   The letters ask 4,000 alumni to contribute $100 a year for the
next 10 years in an effort to raise money for the school's 32
faculty members.
   The letter says the summer drought and low energy prices means
``little or no hope'' for salary increases from the 1989 Legislature.
   Fletcher said Monday that engineering salaries average $34,900 at
the university, compared with the national average of $48,000.
   Most of the engineering faculty members have taught at the
university 20 years or more, but their will begin to wane if
salaries don't go up, he said.
   ``The thing we're concerned about is not the past, but the
future,'' Fletcher said.

<HEAD>Director Andrzej Wajda Offers Services for TV Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renowned filmmaker Andrzej Wajda has
offered his services for a proposed TV debate between Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa and the head of the official trade union alliance.
   Wajda, in a letter to Walesa made public by Solidarity on
Tuesday, suggested that he and his crew record the debate as a
safeguard to prevent its material from being distorted on state-run
television.
   He also proposed the setting up of equivalent camera angles for
Walesa and his debate opponent, Alfred Miodowicz, the Politburo
member who leads the All-Poland Trade Union Alliance.
   The alliance was set up to replace Solidarity when the East
bloc's first independent union movement was banned under martial law
six years ago.
   ``Let me explain why I consider such safeguards necessary,''
Wajda said in the letter dated Friday. ``Television in recent years
has been the main source of disinformation about the Solidarity
chairman. Why should it suddenly change its conduct?''
   Wajda's films include ``Man of Iron,'' an admiring look at the
rise of Solidarity in 1980 in which Walesa appeared briefly, and
``Man of Marble,'' about the disillusionment with the Stalinist
system of a worker-hero of the 1950s.
   Miodowicz proposed the debate covering trade union issues in the
Communist Party paper Trybuna Ludu on Nov. 15. Walesa tentatively
has agreed it should be held Nov. 30.
   It would be the first time Walesa has been given such an
opportunity to present his stands on state-run television. Advisers
to Walesa have proposed holding the debate in the Lenin Shipyard in
Gdansk.
   Walesa advocates making Solidarity legal again and allowing the
existence of more than one union in a plant. Miodowicz says

   Three fisherman were hungry, tired and
sunburned _ but otherwise no worse for wear _ when they were rescued
after drifting on the Pacific Ocean for six days, the Coast Guard
said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Cape George rescued the men, who are from
Agat, late Monday, about 100 miles west of Guam after spotting a
light blinking from their 16-foot aluminum boat, said cutter skipper
Lt. j.g. Daniel Christovich.
   One of the men, 36-year-old James Hubbard, said he and friends Ed
Alianza and Antonio Alforque, both 32, were anchored off Guam's
Facpi Point and planned to troll for a few hours on Nov. 16 when a
heavy rain and strong wind blew them out to sea. Facpi Point is on
Guam's southwest coast just south of Agat.
   ``The wind was taking us to the Philippines, there's no two ways
about it,'' he said.
   The trio waited until the rain subsided to try to get back to
shore, but by then they were two miles away and short on fuel, he
said. They tried to row, but a strong westward wind slowed them down.
   The men survived without water for three days and dumped most of
their fish overboard because they could not eat it without water to
wash it down, Hubbard said. On the fourth day, it rained and the men
rigged a water catchment, Hubbard said.
   ``We drank that stuff down like it was gold,'' he said.

<HEAD>Plan $2.5 Trillion Tunnel to Run Length Of Japan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A construction firm has designed a plan for a
937{-mile water conservation tunnel that would run the length of
Japan's main island and cost $2.5 trillion to build, officials said
Tuesday.
   The tunnel envisioned by Hazama-Gumi, a top civil engineering
firm, would run the length of mountain ranges forming the backbone
of Honshu island and serve as a conduit and reservoir for
distribution of water, said company spokesman Sakai Sato.
   When utilized at 30 percent capacity, the tunnel would hold about
122.5 billion cubic feet of water _ about twice the annual total
water consumption of Tokyo, Sato said.
   The tunnel would be 330 feet in diameter and also could
accommodate high-speed trains and electricity transmission.
   Still at the conceptual stage, the major obstacle to building the
tunnel would be the cost, estimated at $2.47 trillion, Sato said.
   The company designed the tunnel to end Japan's water conservation
problems, he said. It could help prevent flooding and redistribute
water from Japan's mountainous west and northeast, which receive
heavy snow, to drier areas.
   In years of abnormally light precipitation, major cities in
Japan, including Tokyo, face severe water shortages.
   Only 25 percent of Japan's water resources, amounting to 1.1
trillion cubic feet in a dry year, is utilized. Most evaporates or
runs into the sea.

   New violence blamed on anti-government
Sinhalese extremists in the south has claimed the lives of at least
20 people in the past week, authorities said Tuesday.
   Gunmen belonging to the People's Liberation Front, a radical
Sinhalese group, ambushed a police jeep in the village of Hiniduma,
about 50 miles south of the capital, said a police spokesman. Two
officers died and three were wounded, said the spokesman, who
demanded anonymity.
   Suspected Tamil rebels fighting the Sinhalese killed two Indian
peacekeeping soldiers and injured three others, said officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The dates of the attacks were not given.
   The People's Liberation Front, a radical Sinhalese group that has
vowed to disrupt next month's presidential elections, has been
blamed for more than 550 political killings in the past 15 months.
   The group is demanding the resignation of President Junius R.
Jayewardene for his peace overtures to Tamil guerrillas, who have
waged a five-year struggle for a homeland in the northeast.
   The Sinhalese extremists contend a peace accord Jayewardene
signed on July 29, 1987, makes too many concessions to the Tamils.
They also say the 47,000 Indian soldiers deployed to disarm the
guerrillas are violating this island nation's sovereignty.
   On Tuesday, a powerful time bomb exploded on a bridge over the
Kelani River north of Colombo as a train carrying four railroad
workers approached, but no one was injured, the officials said.
   The train derailed about 25 yards before the bridge. The 5:45
a.m. explosion was heard six miles away in the center of Colombo,
police said.
   The train was on its way to Mirigama, about 30 miles northeast of
Colombo, to pick up commuters who work in the capital.
   On Monday in the southern village of Angunakolpelessa, Sinhalese
radicals shot and killed a businessman believed to be a supporter of
the governing United National Party. The four gunmen were killed as
they tried to escape, police said.
   Eight other government supporters were killed in separate
incidents Monday in southern villages, authorities said.
   They said seven suspected Sinhalese extremists were shot and
killed by unidentified attackers Monday night in Hambantota
district, about 105 miles southeast of Colombo.
   The Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, while the Tamils make up 18 percent of the population and
say they are discriminateed against by the Sinhalese-dominated
government.
   More than 8,500 people, mostly Sinhalese, have been killed since
the Tamil rebellion began in 1983.

   Serb and ethnic Albanian officials
traded accusations Tuesday over unrest in the tense southern
province of Kosovo and what sparked the biggest protests there in
more than 40 years.
   Kosovo was reported calm, but authorities braced for more small,
sporadic protests later.
   On Monday, about 7,000 people defied threats of a crackdown on
demonstrations which erupted last Thursday after two ethnic Albanian
leaders resigned under Serbian pressure. Protesters swelled to
100,000 on Saturday.
   Strong pressure was applied to keep the province calm Monday.
Hundreds of Communist Party activists were dispatched to schools,
homes and factories throughout the backward province to urge
students and workers to stay off the streets.
   But Belgrade newspapers attacked ethnic Albanian leaders Tuesday
for failing to control the unrest.
   Serbian speakers at a Serbian Communist Party conference followed
the lead of party chief Slobodan Milosevic in accusing Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority of fomenting ``counterrevolution.''
   In Kosovo, a senior ethnic Albanian official said on condition of
anonymity that he feared renewed unrest could erupt on a massive
scale only if inflammatory statements were made at the conference or
by Belgrade media.
   Otherwise, he likened expected unrest to ``small tremors''
compared to the weekend's ``big earthquake.''
   At the Belgrade conference, delegate Tomislav Sekulic branded the
Kosovo protests outright ``anti-Serbian.''
   Demonstrators had seemed careful, however, not to chant
anti-Serbian slogans, shouting instead ``Yugoslavia! Yugoslavia!''
and ``Brotherhood! Unity!''
   Ethnic Albanian delegates appealed to Serbs not to judge hastily.
   ``What is happening now has nothing to do with the events of
1981,'' said delegate Sevdi Choroli.
   In 1981, both ethnic Albanian and Serbian communist leaders said
riots in which at least nine people died were sparked by 40,000
ethnic Albanians demanding their own republic in Kosovo.
   That would give the ethnic Albanian majority the right to secede
from the Yugoslav federation. Serbs feel strongly about their
ancient heartland of Kosovo and charge ethnic Albanians aim to
secede and unite with neighboring Albania.
   The recent unrest, however, appears to be a response to
Milosevic's campaign to make the Serbian language mandatory in the
judiciary, policing and education in Kosovo and to get more control
over the province.
   Kosovo adminstratively is part of Serbia but won broad autonomy
under the 1974 constitution, which Yugoslav leaders now are trying
to change so they can implement reforms to ease an unprecedented
economic crisis.
   The amendments have been approved by all six republics and both
provinces.
   In Albania, the leader Ramiz Alia criticized Yugoslavia for a
policy of alleged discrimination against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
but the absence of a strident attack signaled his interest in normal
relations.
   Alia pointedly avoided any reference to the demonstrations, but
vaguely referred to ``the great difficulties ... the turbulent
political situation and the national feuds'' in Yugoslavia.
   Restraint was also clear in the following comment: ``Socialist
Albania is developing successfully relations of good neighborhood
with Greece and Turkey, with Bulgaria and Romania, and is making
efforts to create the same positive atmosphere in its relations with
Yugoslavia.''

<DATELINE>FORT MILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Longtime PTL supporters plan to make an
offer for the troubled ministry when it's put on the auction block
again next month, a pastor said Tuesday.
   ``We are waging an all-out war to save Heritage USA for the
entire Christian community,'' said Heritage Ministries Pastor Sam
Johnson.
   ``We have no idea of what's going to happen between now and Dec.
12, except that there's going to be a gigantic outpouring of
people's support,'' Johnson said during the ``Heritage Today'' show.
   Heritage officials were encouraged to try to buy back Heritage
USA, the television satellite network and hundreds of acres of land
after so-called ``lifetime partners'' donated about $600,000 during
a telethon last week.
   Lifetime partners are people who contributed at least $1,000 to
the ministry, earning them certain privileges at Heritage USA.
   PTL went into bankruptcy proceedings in June 1987, three months
after founder Jim Bakker left amid a sex-and-money scandal.
   Johnson said Heritage Ministries' board of directors will make
its offer during an auction in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Columbia on
Dec. 12.
   Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds last week rejected offers as high
as $115 million from Canadians Peter Thomas of Vancouver and Stephen
Mernick of Toronto. He ordered bidding to ``start from scratch'' and
set the Dec. 12 date.
   The judge said if the ministry's assets aren't sold then, he'll
liquidate PTL.

<HEAD>Thanksgiving Food Drive Fails in Maryland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donations to a Thanksgiving food drive in
Maryland fell 70 percent this year, leaving thousands of needy
people facing bleak prospects for their holiday meal.
   The Maryland Food Bank's pre-Thanksgiving Bags of Plenty program
collected 20,000 bags of non-perishable goods last year. As of
Monday, only 5,500 bags of food had been collected, and a total of
7,000 were expected by Tuesday, when the program was to end.
   As a result, thousands of people who received food baskets last
year will not get them this year. Food Bank Director Bill Ewing
estimated that 30,000 to 40,000 people will benefit from this year's
drive, compared with 125,000 last year.
   ``I can't even imagine it being any worse,'' Ewing said.
   ``One woman was in tears,'' Erselle Datcher, a food bank worker,
said Monday after making dozens of phone calls to inform church,
shelter and senior center workers that the program failed this year.
``She runs a small church that doesn't have much money. She wasn't
able to get any turkeys or chickens, so she just purchased some
turkey wings. And we're not going to be able to help her fill her 40
baskets the way we'd like to.''
   Ewing had no explanation for why the food drive failed just weeks
after the United Way exceeded its fund-raising goal. ``Maybe our
advertising was too cutesy _ `stuff a bag this year' _ but it
shouldn't account for a 70 percent drop-off,'' Ewing said.
   The drive has now been extended through Sunday, with an eye
toward Christmas.
   ``We seem to have blown it for Thanksgiving. Any response we get
over the next few days we'll store and make available for a
Christmas basket,'' he said.

   Lee M. Thomas, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency for almost four years, confirmed
Tuesday he will leave the agency on Jan. 20, when George Bush
becomes president.
   His formal announcement made no mention of future plans. ``The
agency deals with an incredible array of issues that are vital to
the well-being of every American,'' it said. ``I am proud of EPA's
15,000 employees and our record of accomplishment.''
   In a recent interview, Thomas said he didn't know what he would
do upon the change of administrations. President Reagan has asked
all his appointees to step down in order to make it easier for Bush
to name his own team.
   Thomas was associate director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency when he was assigned to coordinate the federal government's
1982 buyout of homes at Times Beach, Mo., a town contaminated by
dioxin.
   The success of the buyout led to his selection in 1983 to succeed
Rita Lavelle, the EPA assistant administrator in charge of the new
Superfund toxic waste cleanup program, then the subject of several
congressional investigations into accusations of political
manipulation.
   Shortly after he arrived, then-EPA Administrator Ann Burford
resigned under fire and Thomas found himself doing the jobs of
acting assistant administrator and acting deputy administrator at
the same time with practically no EPA experience under his belt.
   William Ruckelshaus, who succeeded Ms. Burford, kept Thomas on in
the assistant administrator's slot, and recommended Thomas as his
successor when he resigned in December 1984. Thomas took over the
top job in January 1985.

<TEXT>
   Japanese consumers have a growing appetite for
hotdogs, and U.S. hotdog producers are encountering fierce
competition from Australia, Mexico and several other countries for a
share of the market, an the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Total sausage sales in Japan, made up mostly of frankfurters and
weiners, have grown 26 percent in the last three years, the report
said. And imports more than doubled.
   Shipments by U.S. processors in 1987 totaled 699 metric tons,
representing 28 percent of Japan's total sausage imports, the report
said.
   Other competitors include: Australia, with a 22 percent of the
1987 Japanese sausage imports; Mexico, 15 percent; Taiwan, 9
percent; Denmark, 6 percent; Netherlands, 5 percent; West Germany, 5
percent; and others, 10 percent.
   ``Annual per capita consumption of sausage rose from 3.76 pounds
in 1983 to 4.83 pounds in 1987, fueled by a mushrooming demand for
Western-style meats and menus,'' said the report in Foreign
Agriculture magazine.
   Sausage as a main breakfast item is less common in Japan than in
the United States but this main change soon.
   ``McDonald's has introduced a sausage breakfast menu, and many
Western-style restaurants serve sausage for dinner,'' the report
said. Consumers tend to adopt such menus at home over time.''

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old girl who has been
living in her father's adults-only condominium since her mother's
fatal cancer was diagnosed has until after the holiday season to
move out, the condo's attorney said Tuesday.
   Douglas Neway, representing the Viewpoint Condominium board of
directors, said Jamie Swartz must be out by Jan. 10. A letter he
sent to her family said they must show, by providing names of
real-estate brokers and other evidence, a good-faith effort in the
meantime to sell their condo unit.
   ``If the child is still in residence at the unit upon the
expiration of this latest extension, the Board of Directors will
have no choice but to ... file a lawsuit seeking an injunction
preventing the further violation'' of condominium rules, the letter
said.
   Jamie's father and stepmother, who own the condominium, say they
have been unable to sell the condo and cannot afford to move into
another home while still paying the mortgage on it.
   The extension was a relief to the family, but the decision will
cast a pall over their holidays, said Jill Swartz, Jamie's
stepmother.
   ``The holidays are not actually the time that people are actively
out looking for homes,'' she said. ``I think the time element is
working against us.''
   Jamie had moved in temporarily in April after her mother, Maye
Swartz, was hospitalized and later diagnosed as having cancer.
   The condominium association agreed in July to allow Jamie to stay
at the apartment while her mother underwent chemotherapy, but Maye
Swartz died in September. It had granted one extension before the
latest threatened eviction.
   Jill Swartz received a letter from the condominium association
Nov. 10 saying it would seek an injunction to force Jamie out.
   Neway said in a telephone interview that he and condo directors
realized some would say they sound hard-hearted.
   ``I'll admit that this is a great story,'' Neway said. ``However,
as I've tried to make clear, the condominium board has an obligation
to the entire community.''
   A federal open-housing bill that takes effect in March is
designed to protect families against discrimination in housing.
Under the law, buildings that are ``adult only'' could exclude
children only if the managers or owners adopted a policy to rent or
sell to the elderly only.

   Five children tried in vain to escape
through windows and doors, but a fire at their home trapped and
killed them early Tuesday, authorities said.
   The youngsters, including 3-year-old twins, apparently died of
smoke inhalation after they were awakened but blocked by smoke and
flames, authorities said.
   ``They were in the process of trying to get out. All of them
were,'' said Fire Capt. R.L. Hambrick. ``They were all close to a
door or a window, trying to find a way to get out, but when you're
asleep and your house is full of heat and smoke like that you get
disoriented, and you're talking about 3 year olds.''
   Killed were twins Stephen and Stephanie Baumgartner, 15-year-old
Christopher Baumgartner, 12-year-old Amy Todaro and 7-year-old Guy
Todaro, Fire Chief Bill Carter said.
   The Baumgartner children were sleeping at the 90-year-old Todaro
home, police officer Danny Hilbert said. Samuel and Eleanor Todaro,
parents of the other youngsters, were asleep downstairs in the
two-story house and escaped unharmed.
   The parents could not rescue the children because the only
staircase was in flames, Carter said. Firefighters had the same
problem, he said.

<TEXT>
   A four-month dispute over whether a
garden of cultivated weeds constitutes an eyesore or a living work
of art has resulted in a new weed ordinance for this southern
Michigan city.
   That means Ladislav Hanka won't have to take a lawn mower to the
wildflower meadow in his front yard _ to the dismay of his next-door
neighbor.
   Hanka protested an order from the city in July to mow the tall
weeds in his yard, claiming they are part of a wildflower garden he
and his wife began nurturing when they moved to their home in July
1987.
   Kalamazoo city commissioners sided with Hanka on Monday night and
adopted a revised weed ordinance that allows residents to grow weeds
up to 18 inches high.
   Hanka said the commission's action confirmed a resident's right
to deviate from the traditional English-style lawn when cutting
grass.
   ``It's really facing facts and what ... is a coming trend in the
country,'' said Hanka, who grows Queen Anne's lace and other tall
wildflowers in his garden.
   Opponents, including the Vine Neighborhood Association, contend
the revised leaves the law open to potential abuse by negligent
property owners.
   ``We have to be sensitive to others in our neighborhood and the
expectations they had about the appearance of their surroundings
when they made their decision to live in the city,'' said City
Commissioner Bruce Martin, who voted against the amended ordinance.
   Scott Kemple, Hanka's next-door neighbor, said the revised
ordinance is too vague.
   ``Essentially, he could do anything he wants to do over there and
call it a meadow,'' Kemple said.

   U.S. and Canadian Jewish leaders said Tuesday
that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir agreed to consult with them on
the proposed ``Who is a Jew'' amendment but will not move to block
the controversial bill.
   ``We have received no assurances, nothing whatsoever,'' Jewish
Agency chairman Mendel Kaplan said after a meeting with Shamir.
   The proposed legislation would modify Israel's Law of Return,
giving Orthodox rabbis exclusive authority to approve conversions to
Judaism. Jewish converts would be granted automatic Israeli
citizenship only if converted by Orthodox rabbis.
   Most American and Canadian Jews are members of the Reform and
Conservative movements and see the amendment as a threat to their
legitimacy as Jews.
   The amendment has become a bargaining chip in forming Israel's
next government.
   The 12 delegates said Shamir agreed to set up a joint committee
with the Jewish Agency to air the views of North American Jews on
the issue.
   ``It's a serious matter. There are so many people who feel that
with a change in the Law of Return, millions of Jews would be
disenfrachised,'' said Walter Hess, executive vice president of the
Canadian branch of the United Israel Appeal.
   Shoshana Cardin, chairman of the U.S.-Canadian coalition on ``Who
is a Jew,'' said: ``There is a tremendous sense of pain, anguish and
rejection. There is a sense of being subjected to second-class
Jewishness.''
   Four ultra-Orthodox religious parties have demanded passage of
the ``Who is a Jew'' amendment in exchange for supporting Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc in forming a coalition government. Shamir has
pledged to back passage.
   ``Mr. Shamir has an ongoing commitment to the religious parties
as he tries to forge a government,'' Ms. Cardin told reporters. ``He
said he'll see if there's a way to remove this as a burning issue of
the day.''
   But Shamir aide Yossi Ahimeir said Shamir told the Jewish leaders
he would stick to his promise to the religious parties.
   ``He explained to them that the matter was a formal, internal
Israeli matter that should not create a rift or misunderstanding
with diaspora Jewry,'' Ahimeir said.
   In a separate meeting Tuesday, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
assured the U.S. and Canadian delegation his left-leaning Labor
Party would vote against passage.
   Meir Shitrit, a Likud supporter and treasurer of the Jewish
Agency in Israel, said he feared passage could cost the agency $100
million in lost contributions next year.
   The visiting leaders said the United Jewish Appeal in the United
States raised about $300 million for Israel last year. The Canadian
contribution was estimated at about $25 million.
   Shamir must consider forming a coaltion government because Nov. 1
elections to the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, gave Likud 40
seats and Labor 39. The rest went to leftist, rightist and religious
parties.

   White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater softened his attack on a congressionally passed ethics
bill Tuesday as the chief House sponsor of the legislation accused
Fitzwater of using ``flat lies'' to criticize it.
   Fitzwater declined to spell out what complaints administration
officials and others had raised about the bill, saying he didn't
want to ``prejudice'' President Reagan's decision. But a day
earlier, the spokesman had told reporters that some lobbying
restrictions on former executive branch employees were so extreme
that ``they would preclude a former president from calling an
incumbent president.''
   Fitzwater, implying Reagan may veto the bill, also had maintained
that George Bush, as a former vice president, wouldn't be allowed to
call the U.S. Park Service to get a camping permit.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the principal House sponsor of the
Post-Government Restrictions Act of 1988, hotly disagreed with this
description.
   Addressing Fitzwater's statement about former presidents being
barred from giving advice to incumbent presidents, Frank called that
interpretation ``one of the flat lies'' of the White House spokesman.
   ``In the first place, the bill only prevents you from doing this
(lobbying) if you are doing it for pay,'' the congressman said in a
telephone interview Tuesday with The Associated Press.
   ``If Jimmy Carter wanted to talk to Ronald Reagan about any
issue, there's absolutely nothing that prevents that,'' he said.
``Secondly, the bill only applies for a year after leaving office,
and again, only if compensation is involved.''
   Of Fitzwater's statement about Bush, Frank said, ``That, too, is
just a lie.''
   ``The bill specifically allows you to do any lobbying for
yourself or your own business,'' he said. ``In fact, if George Bush
went back to his oil company, he could lobby for it. The
restrictions only apply if you're doing it for compensation and for
other people.''
   Fitzwater could not be reached immediately for comment on Frank's
statements.
   Frank joined three other members of Congress in a letter to
Reagan on Tuesday in which they said the bill ``represents a unique
opportunity for the president and Congress to restore public
confidence in government.''
   The legislation ``slows the revolving door between government and
high-priced lobbying which has long distorted the purpose of
government service,'' said the letter, which was signed by Frank,
along with Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.; Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio; and Dan
Glickman, D-Kan.
   Fitzwater initially had seemed to send a presidential veto signal
when he told reporters Monday the bill had drawn ``some very strong
opposition from Cabinet officials.''
   But on Tuesday Fitzwater said ``I don't know'' when asked whether
Reagan will exercise his constitutional right of pocket veto by
refusing to sign the bill by 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.
   ``We don't know what the president's going to do. He may sign
it,'' the spokesman said during a briefing at a seaside resort while
the president continued a six-day vacation at his ranch north of
Santa Barbara.
   He did say that people both inside the administration and outside
the government were inundating the White House with advice on
whether Reagan should sign the bill.
   He said Reagan ``will receive all those views and digest them at
his leisure on the ranch and then make his judgment known by
memorandum that comes back to us.''
   Fitzwater said some members of the administration, such as
Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, had been uncharacteristically
public with their concerns about the legislation, which some critics
say would discourage people from serving in the government.
   Hodel and other administration officials, including
Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley, have said the bill imposes
overly strict limitations on people who leave the executive branch
for the private sector.
   The bill imposes new lobbying restrictions on former executive
branch officials and applies lobbying restraints for the first time
to former members of Congress.
   What has some in the administration particularly concerned is a
provision in the bill, which was passed overwhelmingly in the House
and by voice vote in the Senate, which would prohibit former
executive branch employees from merely ``aiding or advising'' their
former employers.
   In a memorandum to the Office of Management and Budget, Hodel
lamented the ``particularly obnoxious'' differences in treatment of
former executive branch employees and members of Congress and their
staffs.
   The bill also provides maximum penalties of $250,000 in fines and
five years in prison.

   Yasser Arafat said Tuesday the United States
has agreed to issue him a visa so he can address the U.N. General
Assembly, but the State Department said the PLO chairman hasn't even
applied for one.
   State Department officials acknowledged privately, however, that
Egypt and other moderate Arab nations had asked that Arafat be
granted a visa.
   Arafat indicated President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt helped obtain a
promise of a visa. The Palestine Liberation Organization leader
spoke to reporters after meeting with Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, who said last week that Egypt was interceding on
Arafat's behalf.
   ``President Mubarak informed me today through Dr. Esmat
Abdel-Meguid that the U.S. administration has agreed to grant me an
entry visa so I can address the United Nations,'' Arafat said.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said no
visa application had been received and if one arrived it would be
given ``severe scrutiny.''
   Redman said on Nov. 10 that the Reagan administration would take
into account ``applicable laws and regulations and other pertinent
circumstances'' if Arafat requested a visa.
   Under the 1947 agreement placing U.N. headquarters in New York,
the United States is not supposed to ``impose any impediment to
transit'' of people involved in official business with the United
Nations.
   Congress has authorized denying visas to people who support
terrorism, however, and many terrorist acts have been blamed on PLO
factions over the years.
   Washington said last week the declaration of an independent state
by the Palestine National Council, which acts as the PLO
legislature, did not go far enough in renouncing terrorism and was
too ambiguous in its implicit recognition of Israel.
   In a letter responding to 51 U.S. senators who asked that Arafat
be denied a visa, Secretary of State George P. Shultz said he has
``no desire whatever to see Arafat in the United States.''
   L. Paul Bremer III, head of the State Department
counter-terrorism office, said Tuesday: ``It is simply incorrect to
assert that by its recent declaration the PLO renounced terrorism.''
   Arafat did not specify a date for his second address to the
General Assembly. The first, in 1974, occurred after the PLO was
accepted as a U.N. observer.

   Oil prices soared Tuesday after OPEC
ministers raised hopes the cartel might be near agreement on
curtailing production, but the market retreated when ministers
backed away from their optimism.
   The price swings centered around comments by Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who said early in the day an agreement was
possible but then made a dramatic about-face.
   ``I'm ready to be here for several days,'' he said after emerging
from a closed-door meeting with other ministers late in the day.
   ``There has been no progress,'' said a senior member of an OPEC
delegation, who agreed to talk about the negotiations only if he was
not identified.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been trying
to devise a new plan to limit the cartel's output, but it has been
snagged by a dispute over whether Iraq should have a quota equal to
that of Iran.
   Oil prices have been running nearly 25 percent below OPEC's
benchmark of $18 a barrel because of an oversupply of oil on the
world market.
   Aghazadeh's early optimistic comment electrified the oil markets,
sending the price of the January contract for West Texas
Intermediate crude soaring $1.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. But when he changed his tone, the January contract fell
back and ended the day up 88 cents at $13.86.
   Ecuador's energy minister, Diego Tamariz, said the ministers from
OPEC's 13 member nations would resume formal talks Wednesday
afternoon.
   The ministers opened their winter conference Monday but adjourned
after 90 minutes so members could meet privately to try to resolve
the dispute between Iraq and Iran, who ended an 8-year war in August.
   Iraq wants the same quota in any new cartel accord as Iran, but
Aghazadeh has refused.
   ``I would never concede to parity,'' he told reporters after
meeting for nearly an hour with ministers from Nigeria, Indonesia,
Venezuela and Algeria.
   Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, the Iraq oil minister, was in the
hotel at the same time but apparently was not part of the
discussions with Aghazadeh.
   Earlier in the day, Aghazadeh had told reporters, ``I think we
can reach an agreement.''
   That remark was bolstered by an optimistic comment the Iraqi oil
minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi: ``We're working on an
agreement that will settle all the problems, including that of Iraq
and Iran.''
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who also is Nigeria's oil
minister, said the cartel's regular winter meeting would ``not end
without an agreement.''
   Those positive comments caught the oil markets by surprise and
triggered the runup in price, analysts said.

<HEAD>Study Calls For New Production Incentives For Natural Gas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A modest package of natural gas production and
use incentives could more than pay for itself in benefits to the
economy, according to a study released Tuesday by two former Energy
Department officials.
   The former officials, William Martin and Scott Campbell, said
their proposals could boost the gross national product by $9 billion
annually by 1995 and $29 billion by 2010, and increase tax revenues
$1.4 billion a year within two years of enactment.
   The principal costs of their package would be $350 million lost
annual government revenue through a 10 percent tax credit for
drilling of both exploratory wells and wells aimed at finding
pockets of by-passed gas in old reservoirs.
   Certain other incentives, such as delaying royalty payments on
government lands, could cost an additional $50 million a year, they
said. They also called for spending $100 million a year for
increased research in geology.
   Martin, former deputy secretary, and Campbell, former director of
the department's Office of Policy, Planning and Analysis, resigned
their positions in the fall to join the presidential campaign of
Vice President George Bush.
   Both Bush and his unsuccessful Democratic opponent, Michael
Dukakis, said during the campaign they would make increased use of
natural gas the centerpiece of their energy policies.
   Campbell said the study was not aimed at the Bush transition team
or anyone in particular, but rather ``the marketplace of ideas.''
   Using computer models of the economy in a study paid for by
several gas companies, Martin and Campbell sketched two futures _
one a ``business as usual'' scenario and the other incorporating
their proposals. They assumed that the economy will grow at 2.5
percent per year and overall energy use will grow at slightly less
than 1 percent per year.
   Their proposals called for requiring urban buses to switch to gas
or other clean-burning fuels for the clean-air benefits those fuels
would bring, and use of gas by 5 percent of all cars in 2010. It
also calls for doubling the use of gas by electric utilities, in
part through modifications to clean air legislation that would
permit its intermittent use to reduce pollution; streamlined
procedures for building new gas pipelines and more use of gas to
power air large commercial air conditioners.
   They assumed energy prices would rise in the 1990s to about $4.50
per thousand cubic feet of gas and about $37.50 a barrel for oil
compared with about $1.50 per thousand cubic feet and $14 a barrel
today.
   Under the proposals, gas use would be 24.1 trillion cubic feet in
2010 compared with 18.2 trillion cubic feet under the ``business as
usual'' scenario and 17.7 trillion cubic feet last year. About 16
percent of the gas would be imported from Canada, Mexico, Algeria
and possibly others compared with about 5 percent from Canada last
year.
   Imported oil would be 10.9 million barrels a day or 67 percent of
U.S. consumption vs. 12.5 million barrels a day and 72 percent under
the ``business as usual'' forecast and about 5.9 million barrels a
day and 38 percent last year.
   Coal use would be reduced to 1,150 tons from 1,330 tons in the
``business as usual'' projection, but still 42 percent above last
year's 810 million tons.

   President-elect George Bush promised Tuesday to
``never neglect our friends in this hemisphere'' as he met incoming
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and heralded the
election victory of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney as a
triumph for free trade.
   On a key domestic subject, the vice president also told
Republican governors he would name negotiators for budget talks with
Congress ``on the first day of my presidency.'' But he also said he
viewed his election as a mandate against new taxes.
   He said he hasn't decided on a defense secretary, despite news
reports he will name former Sen. John Tower of Texas.
   New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, who will be Bush's
chief-of-staff, told reporters the vice president still was
``looking at a lot of people'' for the post. A spokeswoman for Tower
said he was ``on hold.''
   Bush and Salinas used upbeat language to describe their two-hour
session at the Johnson Space Center in Texas. They gave few
specifics in brief remarks afterward, but Bush aides said topics had
included drugs, immigration, trade and Mexico's $102 billion
international debt.
   ``I am absolutely confident after this initial visit that we're
both committed to improving a bilateral relationship that is
essential, in my view, as far as the United States of America is
concerned,'' Bush said.
   Salinas called the session ``a positive, respectful and cordial
dialogue which I am certain will do a great deal to improve the
relations between Mexico and the United States.''
   Bush thanked Salinas for coming to his hometown. Salinas, who has
degrees from Harvard University in the United States, invited the
vice president to visit him in Mexico City.
   Before Tuesday's meeting, Bush had called it ``the first of many
important bilateral meetings'' he planned with world leaders.
   In Toronto, Mulroney, fresh from his victory on Monday, said he
had spoken to Bush by telephone and was willing to meet with him
before the U.S. leader's inauguration on Jan. 20.
   Accompanying the vice president were Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, whom Bush has announced will keep that job, and James A.
Baker III, Bush's choice for secretary of state.
   Aides said the lunch session between the two presidents-elect
would likely cover trade, the ailing Mexican economy and drug
enforcement. But Bush himself said in advance that there was no
specific agenda.
   Speaking with reporters on the trip from Washington, he said the
meeting was ``just a visit to manifest the importance I place in our
Mexican-U.S. relations.''
   Addressing the Republican Governors Association in Point Clear,
Ala., Bush said the U.S. relationship with Mexico ``is very, very
important. We must never take it for granted.''
   ``As I look at the world, we must never neglect our friends in
this hemisphere, in our own front yard,'' Bush said, mentioning both
Mexico and Canada.
   He told the governors' group the outcome of the Canadian
elections was a ``spectacular win'' for Mulroney and an endorsement
by Canadians of the free-trade pact negotiated by Mulroney and the
Reagan administration.
   ``That indeed was a referendum on whether we're going to have
more markets and freer trade, both ways,'' Bush said.
   Mulroney's conservatives won the seats needed in the Canadian
House of Commons to save the pact, which will phase out virtually
all tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers between the two nations
over ten years.
   The vice president, who has called for negotiating a similar
free-trade deal with Mexico, phoned Mulroney from Alabama to
congratulate him, according to spokesman Stephen Hart.
   In his address to the GOP governors, Bush said that in addition
to engaging in early deficit-reduction talks with Congress, he
planned to convene a conference of all 50 governors to talk about
education.
   As for federal-state relations, Bush promised to ``continue what
Ronald Reagan and I began in 1980 _ to stop the flow of power to
Washington and return it where it belongs, to the states.''
   Bush told reporters he had made no decision yet on his defense
secretary, and he indicated there would be no announcement this week.
   He said he hopes to finish naming his Cabinet within a month but
expressed mild irritation about ``reading these stories about what I
have decided.''
   ``Some day, somebody will understand that I set how those things
are going to work,'' he said.
   ``The Tower story is not right. No decision has been made,'' Bush
added.
   Pressed on the subject later at a photo session with Salinas,
Bush would say only that he wanted a person as defense secretary
``who will fulfill the defense initiatives I discussed in the
campaign.''
   Sununu said, ``There is a feeling that there are two things
required'' of a defense secretary: ability to deal with Congress and
``someone who has management capacity, perhaps beyond the Beltway,''
the latter a reference to the highway loop around Washington.
   He declined to say whether Tower, the former chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, had such qualities. But, when asked
if Tower could be ruled out, Sununu said: ``I wouldn't rule out
anybody with that kind of experience at this point.''
   Bush traveled to Texas on the same aircraft that carried
President John F. Kennedy's body, and President Lyndon Johnson, back
from Dallas 25 years ago Tuesday.

<HEAD>Silicone Breast Implants Pass Initial Safety Review</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is not enough data suggesting silicone
breast implants are a health hazard to warrant barring them from the
medical market, a federal advisory panel concluded Tuesday.
   However, the seven-member committee convened by the Food and Drug
Administration decided to meet again in two months to consider any
additional evidence before making a final recommendation.
   Assuming no significant new evidence surfaces during that time,
the panel will renew its tentative call for three specific steps to
study the safety of the gel implants over the next few years.
   After a full day of testimony and deliberation Tuesday, the
committee unanimously called for:
   _Establishment of a national registery of women who have breast
implants so long-range studies can be carried out to determine
whether there is a heightened risk of breast cancer or other health
problems.
   _Drafting of a mandatory, standardized consent form to be signed
by any prospective patient for a breast implant before the procedure
can be done.
   _An FDA policy to keep physicians and the public at large aware
of any new information as it develops from whatever long-range
studies are devised.
   An estimated 2 million U.S. women have had silicone gel implants
over the past two decades, including about 15 percent who used the
procedure for reconstruction of breast tissue surgically removed
during cancer treatment.
   The rest simply wanted larger breasts.
   The FDA has invoked a procedure whereby the gel implants will
have to undergo the type of scientific review normally associated
with new medical devices, even though the implants were already on
the market in 1976 when Congress gave the FDA authority over such
products.
   Since they were already on the market, implants and several other
so-called medical devices already in widespread use _ condoms are
one example _ which were given ``grandfather'' approval under the
legislation.
   Referring to breast implants, the FDA said earlier this month it
has decided ``there are sufficient concerns about these products to
call for pre-market approval applications. This means that in order
for the implants to remain on the market, manufacturers will have to
supply FDA with scientific data demonstrating that they are safe and
effective.''
   However, the agency noted that the law sets a schedule giving the
makers of such ``grandfathered'' products time to provide
documentation for the safety of their products and said in the case
of silicone implants, ``the deadline can be no sooner than December
1990.''
   Meanwhile, the agency has said it will see that the labeling
information manufacturers are required to supply doctors ``explains
adequately what is known about potential risks.''
   Even though the law sets up a timetable for manufacturers to
submit data to justify the safety and efficacy of their products,
the FDA could move to remove implants under emergency procedures if
it determined there was a clear health risk.
   The significance of the advisory panel's conclusion was that it
saw no need to invoke such extraordinary steps.

<HEAD>Latvian Legislature Meets to Consider Autonomy Issue</HEAD>

   Latvia's legislature ended a special session
Tuesday without voting on a populist organization's demand for
autonomy in the Baltic republic, activists reported.
   The same question came up in Lithuania's legislature last Friday
and no vote was taken, but Estonia's legislature approved a
``declaration of sovereignty'' on Nov. 16 along with a
constitutional amendment declaring the republic autonomous in all
areas except defense and foreign policy.
   Janis Dinevich said the Latvian legislators took no action on
proposed changes in the Latvian constitution. He serves on the
governing council of the Latvian People's Front, which has pushed
for autonomy.
   ``In principle, they didn't touch the republican constitution,''
Dinevich said by telephone. ``They're not looking at the republican
constitution.''
   He said leaders of the People's Front would meet ``very, very
soon'' to plan a response.
   In the Caucasus, site of a long territorial dispute between the
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Kremlin's representative
halted an Armenian legislative session Tuesday because of ethnic
tension caused by protests in Azerbaijan, official reports said.
   Arkady Volsky, sent by the Kremlin to oversee its policy in the
area, flew immediately to Stepanakert, capital of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region claimed by both republics, said an editor of
the official Armenpress news agency.
   Ethnic rioting in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, last February cost the
lives of at least 32 people.
   Commissions of the Supreme Soviet, the national parliament, have
said the Estonian constitutional amendment violates the national
constitution. National newspapers have accused Estonian and
Lithuanian activists of causing ethnic tension.
   Exactly what Latvia's legislature did in its 12-hour session was
unclear to those who listened on live broadcasts.
   ``Except for the best lawyers in the republic, no one can say,''
said Andrei Tsirulis, editor of the youth newspaper Padomju
Jaunatne. Tsirulis said by telephone from Riga, the capital, he
would have to wait for official reports released in the morning to
find out what the legislators approved.
   Mikhail Bombin, correspondent for the Moscow human rights journal
Express-Khronika, said Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov told the
legislature there was no need to vote on greater autonomy because of
changes being made in proposed amendments to the Soviet constitution.
   Dozens of people supporting autonomy gathered outside the
legislative chamber, Bombin said.
   Activists in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have demanded greater
economic and cultural freedom under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
plan for increased local control. The three Baltic republics were
independent between the world wars, but the Soviet Union took them
over in 1940 under an agreement with Nazi Germany.
   Baltic activists claim proposed amendments to the Soviet
constitution will reduce local authority rather than increasing it.
   Those reporting on Tuesday's developments said the legislature
approved proposals for changes to those amendments but the details
were not made clear during the live broadcast.
   Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, continued its criticism of
People's Front groups in the Baltic states, warning Lithuanian
activists Tuesday that ``democracy without responsibility can turn
into evil.''
   It said leaders of Sajudis, the Lithuanian group, ``are not
afraid to verbally abuse separate individuals and the authorities or
paint or print posters which have no other aim than provocation.''
   A special commission of the national parliament has recommended
some changes in amendments proposed by Gorbachev to limit powers of
a new national council, which originally would have been able to
strike down laws adopted by the legislatures of the 15 Soviet
republics.
   Tsirulis said the People's Front of Latvia had asked the
legislators in Riga to take legal measures ``so the republic will
have sovereignty inside the Soviet Union.''
   ``The Latvian people support the proposals of the People's Front
and want them adopted,'' he said.

   The Reagan administration will need $35 billion
in deficit reductions in its final budget and will get there in part
by proposing approximately $15 billion in cuts in government benefit
programs, the president's chief budget director said Tuesday.
   Joseph R. Wright, director of the Office of Management and
Budget, said Social Security will not be touched, but he indicated
that government health programs such as Medicare would be prime
targets for savings.
   In a wide-ranging interview, Wright said Reagan's final budget
would be a conservative document reflecting the president's
priorities in defense spending and his continued efforts to reduce
the size of the federal government in other areas.
   In that regard, Wright said the budget would propose a 2 percent
increase in defense spending, after taking inflation into account.
Defense spending this year accounts for roughly 30 percent of the
$1.1 trillion budget.
   Wright rejected arguments that the Reagan budget was being
drafted with a view toward paving the way for President-elect George
Bush to come in with a ``kinder, gentler'' budget that would reduce
the president's defense spending request and use the savings to
boost spending for domestic programs.
   ``This is not a crash and burn budget,'' Wright said. ``The
preident wants to put together a reasonable, responsible,
conservative budget.''
   Wright said the president had established as a guiding principle
that the benefits received by the elderly and poor would not be
touched.
   He said Reagan also insisted, as he has in the past, that Social
Security be placed off-limits for any budget savings.
   But Wright said this left open such expensive government programs
as Medicare, which provides insurance for the elderly.
   He said that while out-of-pocket expenses for the elderly would
not be increased, the administration was looking at savings through
reductions in payments made to hospitals and doctors.
   Wright would not give any breakdown on how the approximately $15
billion in savings would be obtained or how it would be allocated
among governemnt benefit programs, saying OMB was still in the
process of reviewing budget appeals raised by the various agencies.
   Wright did provide a new estimate of $35 billion in reductions
which will be needed to reach the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of
$100 billion for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1.
   That is $3 billion higher than the figure OMB used just two weeks
ago and reflects the revised economic forecast the administration
released Tuesday, showing that the drought had had a greater impact
on economic growth than first believed.
   Wright said the administration fully intended to meet the $100
billion deficit target for 1990 and would propose program changes
that would bring the budget into balance by 1993.
   Wright said this would be accomplished by proposing ``no new
taxes.'' However, he would not rule out recommendations the
administration has made in the past to boost revenues by various
types of user fees and by selling some federal assets. He would not
give any estimate of how much money would be raised by increasing
revenues.
   The budget director, who took over in October from former OMB
Director James A. Miller III, said he had not had contact with the
Bush transition team in drawing up Reagan's final spending plan.
   But Wright said he believed the new administration would have no
difficulty in making modifications to the basic document to fit
priorities Bush mentioned during the campaign.
   Other areas in which the administration was likely to look for
savings included agricultural subsidy programs and retirement
benefits for federal employees, Wright said.
   He indicated that many of the spending cuts and proposed hikes in
user fees would be proposals that the administration has proposed in
the past, only to have them rejected by Congress.
   But Wright said he did not believe Reagan's final budget would
provoke ``any firestorm'' from Congress.

   John F. Kennedy's family and friends paused
Tuesday to celebrate his life and mourn the dreadful moment 25 years
ago when the youthful president was murdered in Dallas and ``the
heartbeat of a nation stood still.''
   Kennedy was remembered in the salutes of an elite Army unit, in
the simple, graveside tribute of his longtime secretary, in a
private Mass for his widow and children, in a vigil in the Capitol
Rotunda, and with flowers at home and abroad _ including the single
white rose left by his youngest and only surviving brother at a
historic meadow in England.
   Although no official ceremonies were held in Dallas, about 2,500
people thronged Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was felled by an
assassin's rifle as he waved to crowds from an open limousine at
midday Nov. 22, 1963.
   Twenty people clapsed hands along the motorcade route Tuesday,
and a crucifix and two bouquets of flowers were deposited at the
approximate spot on Elm Street where the president was struck.
   A note on one bouquet read, ``We still miss you _ Nov. 22.'' On
the other, the message read, ``After 25 years, we still love you,
John.'' Schoolteacher Jean Hill, who saw Kennedy killed that day,
brought her 50 third-graders to the scene.
   The president's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and her two
children, John Jr. and Caroline, attended a private Mass at St.
Thomas More's Roman Catholic Church in New York City. A spokeswoman
for the former first lady said the family planned no public
appearances.
   In Washington, hundreds of former Peace Corps volunteers ended a
24-hour vigil in the Capitol Rotunda and attended a memorial Mass at
St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral, where Kennedy's funeral
service was held.
   Officiating at the Mass was the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, a former
Peace Corps adviser who also took part in Kennedy's funeral service.
Hesburgh, the retired longtime president of Notre Dame, recalled
that when Kennedy was killed, ``the heartbeat of a nation stood
still.''
   He told the former volunteers that if Kennedy ``was here today,
he'd probably say that `you are the people who delivered the message
I gave to the world' and that the Peace Corps `will be my best and
brightest memory.'''
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the president's sister, and a black-clad
Ethel Kennedy, widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who was
assassinated in June 1968, made early-morning visits to the two
Kennedy gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Mrs. Shriver said she hoped people would remember John Kennedy
for ``the high points of his life, the laughter and the vision.''
   Ethel Kennedy was one of the first mourners to appear at the
cemetery when the gates opened at 8 a.m. She knelt silently before
the eternal flame that burns at the president's grave and then
walked to her husband's grave nearby.
   ``I think for the family it's a private moment,'' she said.
``It's a wonderful outpouring of love.''
   Evelyn Lincoln, the late president's personal secretary, made her
annual pilgrimage to the grave and laid three red roses near the
eternal flame. ``It's the least I can do,'' she said.
   About 30 uniformed Green Berets, the U.S. Army Special Forces
unit created by Kennedy, laid a large wreath at the grave. They then
formed a semicircle and saluted their former commander in chief.
Members of Kennedy's former White House staff attended a Mass at the
cemetery amphitheater and placed a bouquet of roses on his grave.
   The president's only surviving brother, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., laid a single white rose at the foot of a British memorial
to the president at Runnymede, England, west of London, during a
private visit with friends.
   Wearing a black trenchcoat, the senator crossed himself and said
a silent prayer before the memorial, a large slab of stone on the
side of a hill at the place where King John in 1215 granted the
charter of civil and political liberties known as the Magna Carta.
   ``We think it's extremely important to celebrate the life of
President Kennedy rather than the tragedy,'' Kennedy told reporters.
``We're focusing on the birthday (May 29) and the hope of his life
rather than dwelling upon his loss.''
   In the vaulted Capitol Rotunda, where the president's body lay in
state 25 years ago, the last of an estimated 450 former Peace Corps
volunteers or their surrogates completed a 24-hour vigil of readings
and songs dedicated to Kennedy, who founded the overseas development
agency in March 1961.
   Former Sen. Paul Tsongas, D-Mass., who was a Peace corps
volunteer in Ethiopia when Kennedy was killed, told his audience
that ``only part of John Kennedy died 25 years ago. The best part of
him is alive and here in all of us.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who was a volunteer in the
Dominican Republic in 1966-68, said the Peace Corps was ``a living
memorial'' to Kennedy and its volunteers ``will always be our best
ambassadors.''

Election</HEAD>

   As the largest metropolitan area on the
U.S.-Canadian border, Detroit could evolve as a commercial center
under the free trade agreement that got a boost when Conservatives
won Canada's election, an economist said Tuesday.
   Business leaders in Michigan envision a developing
Chicago-to-Toronto trade area with Detroit in the middle, a center
for trade-related accounting, brokerage and other services.
   ``I would expect that there will be an increase in trade and
trade-related services. Consultants and other service providers in
Detroit will have access to the vast growing market in Ontario, and
by the same token Canadians will have better access to Michigan
markets,'' said Wayne State University economist David Verway, who
conducted a free trade impact analysis for the Greater Detroit
Chamber of Commerce.
   ``It will represent a brand new market for small businesses that
are able to see that potential, small consultants, architects,
people in the construction trades,'' he said.
   After Monday's victory, Canadian Conservatives are expected to
push the free trade agreement through Parliament next month.
   In 10 years, the pact would phase out tariffs on the 22 percent
of Canadian exports still subject to United States duties and on the
35 percent of U.S. exports still subject to Canadian duties.
   The immediate impact on the annual $25.7 billion in trade between
Canada and Michigan will be slight. Eighty percent of that trade
already moves duty free because of the Autopact, which lets vehicle
manufacturers ship new vehicles and parts across the border without
tariffs.
   But business leaders are hopeful the free trade agreement will
hold commercial benefits for border states like Michigan and cities
like Buffalo, N.Y., located 90 miles to the south of Toronto.
   Several developers have proposed trade centers that would help
alleviate congestion on the International Peace Bridge, a three-lane
bridge that connects Buffalo with Fort Erie, Ontario.
   On Tuesday, developers Robert and Peter Elia presented more
detailed plans for their proposed $200 million trade center near the
Peace Bridge. The complex would contain a 20-story office building,
two 15-story office buildings, an apartment-hotel and a huge
open-air truck processing facility. Financing and a completion date
have not been set.
   In far northern Michigan, Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., population
15,000, and Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., population 85,000, across the
St. Marys River, have been preparing for the agreement, Francis
Mansfield said.
   Mansfield, executive director of the Sault Ste. Marie, Mich.,
Chamber of Commerce, said the economic development commissions of
the two cities have been holding joint committee meetings.
   Robert Patterson, director of the Industrial Development Corp. of
Port Huron, Mich., said the trade agreement will facilitate
development in Michigan linked to Ontario's largest petrochemical
complex, in Sarnia, across the St. Clair River.
   Detroit Molded Plastics Co. already is building an area plant
that will use feedstocks from the Sarnia complex and supply material
for automakers in Detroit, one hour's drive to the south, and Flint,
one hour to the west.
   Patterson said the area has plants owned by Canadian companies,
also supplying the automakers with springs, door locks and the like.
``We have five or six Canadian companies located here now and we're
looking for more in the future,'' he said.
   The United States and Canada are the world's largest trading
partners, with two-way trade expected to reach $150 billion this
year.

   The government announced plans Tuesday to establish
controls on its secret service MI5, sell off billions of dollars of
state utilities, and require any political candidate in Northern
Ireland to renounce violence.
   The measures were part of a far-reaching legislative program for
the next year _ the 10th written by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative government _ read aloud by Queen Elizabeth
II at the glittering opening of Parliament.
   Despite immediate protests from the opposition and from pro-IRA
or moderate Roman Catholic groups in Northern Ireland, most of the
measures were virtually certain of passage by the 650-member House
of Commons, where Mrs. Thatcher has a huge 101-seat majority.
   By tradition, Mrs. Thatcher and other members of the House of
Commons stood at the back entrance to the unelected House of Lords
while the queen, in long white gown and jeweled crown, announced the
program to rows of ermine-robed peers and diplomats.
   ``A bill will be introduced to put the security service on a
statutory basis,'' said the queen, announcing that formal operating
rules will be drawn up for the first time for MI5.
   But Mrs. Thatcher later made it clear the shadowy service, which
deals with domestic security, will remain accountable only to
Cabinet officials and not Parliament as critics have demanded. MI5
currently reports to a Cabinet subcommittee.
   Officials said the measures would not apply to MI6, Britain's
other secret service agency, which gathers intelligence from abroad.
   Some analysts predicted the move will tighten agents' lifelong
secrecy oaths following the government's failed attempt through
courts in several countries to suppress ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs
of retired agent Peter Wright.
   Wright claimed in his book that MI5 tried to destabilize the
1970s left-of-center Labor Party government, bugged foreign
embassies and plotted to assassinate Egyptian President Gamal Abdul
Nasser.
   The proposed new laws include a liberalization of the 1911
Official Secrets Act, although critics note the proposals still
would not allow civil servants who leak unauthorized documents to
argue they acted in the public interest.
   The 16 proposed bills included Mrs. Thatcher's plans to sell off
the state-owned water and electricity utilities.
   The sales, denounced by the opposition Labor Party, are the
biggest and most controversial of Mrs. Thatcher's massive
privatization program and will raise an estimated $55 billion.
   For Northern Ireland, where sectarian violence has been met by
increasingly controversial measures by the Thatcher government, any
candidate running for any elected political office would have to
sign an oath rejecting violence. Under the measure, such candidates
could be sued by other politicians _ Protestant opponents _ or
members of the public, and banned from office.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to
end British rule of the Protestant-dominated province.
   ``The government is determined never to give in to the
terrorist,'' Mrs. Thatcher declared later in the Commons, launching
a six-day debate on the queen's speech.
   Officials said despite the law providing for the proposed
non-violence pledge _ which is aimed at members of the outlawed
IRA's legal political front, Sinn Fein _ candidates can say what
they like during the election campaign.
   Sinn Fein has 59 elected members of local councils and one member
of the House of Commons, Gerry Adams.
   ``Further repression, the increasing erosion of our few remaining
civil liberties and British efforts to marginalize Sinn Fein are not
the way to resolve the conflict,'' said Sinn Fein spokesman Danny
Morrison.
   State investigators would also be able to demand from banks
details of accounts through which the IRA is suspected of moving
funds raised through legitimate businesses or racketeering.
   In another measure, the government outlined its first bill to
curb job discrimination _ mainly against the Catholic minority _ in
Northern Ireland.
   The new measure will force businesses with 10 employees or more
to monitor the religious makeup of the work force.
   The proposed laws also included a new attempt to curb Britain's
notoriously violent soccer fans by forcing clubs to register
members. Only card-carrying members will be allowed into stadiums
and spectators convicted of violence can be banned for up to five
years.
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, traveled to Parliament
from Buckingham Palace in a new horse-drawn coach, a bicentennial
gift from Australia.

<HEAD>Woman Convicted of Posing As Treasury Agent in Loan Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington woman was convicted Tuesday of
bilking two investors out of $55,000 by posing as a Treasury
Department official who could help them get loans.
   Carrye E. Maxwell, who was linked to money laundering and fraud
charges against five men scheduled to stand trial in January, was
convicted of two counts of wire fraud and three counts of
impersonating a federal official.
   Ms. Maxwell could receive a maximum sentence of 16 years in
prison. U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer scheduled sentencing
for Feb. 1.
   The jury found Ms. Maxwell guilty of posing as a special
consultant to a non-existent Treasury Department program she said
had access to foreign funds for loans.
   The May 6, 1988, indictment charged that she prepared bogus
letterheads and put fake seals on documents to deceive investors
into believing she was a consultant to the ``United States Recycle
Program.''
   The scheme is also the subject of a related indictment against a
Miami businessman, Walter E. Johnson, and four co-defendants who are
scheduled to stand trial on money laundering and fraud charges on
Jan. 10.
   Ms. Maxwell was convicted of bilking Robert M. Capuano, operator
of a local pizza restaurant, out of $30,000 in 1985 by saying she
needed the money to help him get a multimillion-dollar loan he never
received.
   She was also convicted of inducing James A. Whatley in 1985 to
pay her $25,000 out of his bank account in Nashville, Tenn., as a
bogus loan fee.
   The indictment against Johnson and his four co-defendants charges
that the conspirators showed officials from a suburban Philadelphia
company a letter Maxwell wrote on bogus Treasury Department
stationary to bolster their scheme to bilk the firm out of $100,000.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ordered nine people jailed Tuesday
as part of a fraud-and-forgery probe of the Church of Scientology.
Three Americans, including the church's president, were among 71
people arrested.
   Judge Jose Maria Vazquez Honrubia said he was still questioning
people arrested during a police sweep of alleged Scientology members
on Sunday. The raid capped a nine-month investigation into
complaints by Spaniards who said they had been bilked by the church.
   Questioning of suspects was delayed two hours Tuesday after a
bomb threat forced the evacuation of Madrid's 21st District Court.
   Vazquez Honrubia told reporters that of 71 people arrested, nine
were ordered to prison pending further investigation and that 14
still were being held for questioning.
   Another 47 were questioned and released, including six foreigners
ordered expelled from Spain. The judge said it was still uncertain
whether one other person arrested Sunday would be freed or
imprisoned.
   Spanish law allows examining magistrates to hold suspects up to
48 hours without charge. Judges can order suspects to prison if they
feel further investigation is warranted.
   Among those arrested Sunday was Heber Jentzsch, a Los Angeles
resident, former Hollywood actor and current president of the
controversial Church of Scientology International.
   It was unclear whether Jentzsch was still held. A court clerk
initially said Jentzsch was among those ordered to prison pending
further investigation, but Vazquez Honrubia later said he had not
yet questioned Jentzsch.
   Jentzsch was among two other Americans arrested. The judge said
people of 14 nationalities were seized.
   Authorities said the 71 people were arrested during raids on a
Madrid hotel, where the group was holding a meeting; the
headquarters of Narconon, a drug rehabilitation program; and other
programs associated with the Church of Scientology.
   The raids took place after a nine-month police probe, during
which wiretaps indicated the group was planning an international
meeting in the city, the judge said.
   He said the probe was prompted by complaints from Spaniards who
said they had been swindled out of money through drug rehabilitation
programs and other activities related to the Church of Scientology.
   Vazquez Honrubia said charges that would be brought include
fraud, illegal association, coercion, forgery of public documents,
tax evasion and failure to meet social security payments.
   Heroin use is widespread in Spain, particularly among the
nation's 18-to-25-year-olds, 45 percent of whom are unemployed and
have never held jobs.
   A woman at the Los Molinos Narconon center in Madrid, said 60
people were undergoing treatment involving vitamins, exercise and
counseling. The program costs $1,600 a month.
   Spain's annual per capita income is less than $8,000.
   In a statement Monday in Washington, the Church of Scientology
condemned the raid.
   ``Whoever is behind these acts of harassment obviously stands to
profit from increased drug proliferation and addiction,'' the
statement said.
   Sylvia Standard, a church spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said
Jentzsch is a former actor who appeared in the film ``Paint Your
Wagon.'' She said he was elected president of the Church of
Scientology International in 1982.
   ``He's been very personally involved for years in drug
rehabilitation,'' she said.
   Litigation is pending against the organization in the United
States, where it was founded in 1954 by L. Ron Hubbard, a science
fiction author whose books still are widely publicized. Hubbard, who
wrote ``Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,'' died in
1986.
   In 1984, the U.S. government began an investigation of Hubbard's
tax returns after the Internal Revenue Service said it suspected
millions of dollars in church funds had been transferred to Hubbard
to protect the church's tax-exempt status and to avoid paying taxes.
   Scientologists said the government conspired to harass the
organization in violation of its religious freedom. The Supreme
Court is considering the case.

   The wife of a naval intelligence officer
convicted of spying for Israel said in a prison interview Tuesday
she has never spied and complained that authorities are ignoring her
medical problems.
   ``I don't know classified information, this is well known in the
Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons,'' Anne Pollard said.
``Yet for some unknown reason I am singled out, as is my husband, in
terms of our First Amendment rights.
   ``I've never committed espionage in my life. I never would,'' she
said.
   A Justice Department representative sat across from Mrs. Pollard
at the federal prison camp to guard against any leak of secret
information and to limit the interview to one hour.
   Her husband, Jonathan Jay Pollard, has admitted selling
classified information to Israel from 1984 until his arrest in
November 1985 for as much as $2,500 a month.
   Pollard, a Jew, said he began working as a spy after deciding the
United States wasn't providing Israel with the information it needed
to protect its security, according to court documents. He is serving
a life prison term.
   Mrs. Pollard, 28, was found guilty of conspiracy to receive
embezzled government property and possession of national defense
documents. The charges stem from her attempt to deliver a suitcase
containing government documents to her husband after his operation
was uncovered by federal authorities.
   He had called her and asked for her help, according to court
documents. She is serving a five-year prison term.
   ``When my husband called me I merely responded to his request.
That's what I felt ethically a wife should do,'' she said.
   Mrs. Pollard refused to answer when asked how long she had known
about her husband's spy activities, saying only, ``I have known
about my husband's ideology since the first day I met him.''
   She also refused to say if she knew her husband was being paid by
the Israelis, but denied that she benefitted from the arrangement.
   ``I have never made an illegal dime in my life,'' Mrs. Pollard
said.
   Once robust and healthy, she is now frail and nearly doubled over
from a number of maladies. She suffers migraine headaches, is
reliant upon laxatives and no longer can see clearly.
   Mrs. Pollard said she has uncontrollable bleeding caused by an
ovarian cyst; that she suffers from a rare disorder which prevents
her from properly digesting food; that she has an irritated bowel;
and problems with her intestines that keep her from sitting up or
standing up straight.
   She is seeking a medical furlough so that physicians at Yale
University can treat her, but she has been denied permission. Her
condition has caused many in Israel and the United States to
petition government officials to release her for treatment outside
the prison system.
   ``As far as the legal processes are concerned, I can vindicate
myself in a court of law. I'm not worried about that. That can come
up in the future. I'm worried about my medical condition. I'm 28
years old. I'd like to function like a normal 28-year-old. These are
problems which can be treated and have gone untreated,'' she said.
   Paul Lefebvre, the camp's administrator, said Mrs. Pollard is
receiving proper medical treatment.
   ``We have adequate resources to deal with her medical needs,'' he
said.
   The Pollards were sentenced in Washington, D.C., in March 1987
after both decided against a trial and agreed to a plea bargain.
   ``My husband and I were forced to sign a plea agreement. I would
elaborate on that, but I can't due to potential litigation,'' she
said.
   ``The legal term is they `wired' me and my husband together,''
Mrs. Pollard said, explaining she wasn't willing to sacrifice her
husband to make a better deal for herself. ``My husband is the most
important thing in the world to me. I wouldn't do anything to harm
or hurt my husband.''
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell, who attended Tuesday's
interview, said: ``There is no cabal against her or her husband.''

<HEAD>Government Decrees Day of Mourning For Massacre Anniversary</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The government has designated Nov.
29 a day of mourning for people massacred when Haiti tried to hold
free elections on that date last year.
   At least 34 voters were shot, stabbed or hacked to death the
morning of Nov. 29, 1987, by thugs who were protected by soldiers.
The election was canceled and Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, then Haiti's
ruler, dissolved the independent Electoral Council.
   ``The military goverment wants to pay public and national homage
to all the victims of the aborted elections on Nov. 29, 1987,'' said
the decree, issued by the Information Ministry and dated Monday.
   It said public services, schools, businesses and factories will
be closed Nov. 29 and flags at government offices will fly at half
staff.
   No one was ever charged with the killings.
   Soldiers ousted Namphy on Sept. 17, declaring themselves sickened
by state-sponsored violence, and chose Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to
succeed him.
   Avril said in a letter to political leaders Saturday that all
Haitians were responsible for the massacre, not just the gunmen.
   ``The decree seems to be a correction of the letter,'' said
Arnold Antonin, co-director of the National Network for the Defense
of Human Rights. ``Avril wants to make clear his support for the
victims and not the criminals.''
   Sorel Jacinthe, assistant director of the Bishops Center for
Human Rights, supported the decree but added: ``What is fundamental
is to try the criminals.''
   The two human rights groups and three others said in a joint
statement they will hold a procession Nov. 29 commemorating the

   An IRA hand grenade exploded
in the yard of a police station Tuesday, damaging a parked car but
causing no injuries, police reported.
   In Belfast, police defused a bomb under an officers car about two
miles from where Princess Anne was visiting. A police spokesman said
no one was injured, he said.
   Anne, daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, was accompanied by Northern
Ireland Secretary Tom King as she visited a high school, inaugurated
a sports trust and met members of a riding association for the
handicapped. She then returned to London.
   In Londonderry, the outlawed Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility for the grenade attack at the Royal Ulster
Constabulary station on Strand Road. The IRA is trying to drive the
British from the Protestant-dominated province and unite it with the
Irish Republic, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

   The Air Force unveiled its
sinister-looking B-2 stealth bomber Tuesday, giving the world its
first look at the gray-and-black flying wing designed to evade enemy
radar and deliver nuclear weapons.
   The bomber, which has never been flown, was towed slowly out of a
hangar at Air Force Plant 42 in the Mojave Desert to cheers from an
invitation-only crowd of 2,000 workers, military brass, media and
industry representatives.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The rollout ceremony, conducted before a giant American flag, was
in part a celebration of U.S. industrial ingenuity and in part, a
bit of high-tech saber rattling.
   Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force's chief of staff, said the
plane's declared ability to slip through radar at all altitudes to
deliver its payload of nuclear bombs represents a potent deterrent
to those who would attack the United States.
   ``Its stealth capability will permit it to penetrate the most
sophisticated air defenses and survive well into the 21st century,''
Welch said. ``The B-2 is a superb example of the inherent
technological advantage of free society.''
   The rollout followed by three weeks the Pentagon's release of a
photo of another closely guarded project, Lockheed Corp.'s stealth
fighter, the F-117A. That plane has been flying since 1981 and was
declared ready for wartime missions in 1983; its existence was
acknowledged because the Air Force was preparing to start its first
daylight flights.
   Nearly everything surrounding the stealth bomber is secret,
including the cost.
   The General Accounting Office estimates the fleet of 132 stealth
bombers the Air Force wants to assemble over the next several years
could cost taxpayers $68 billion. That would put them at more than
$500 million a copy.
   The Air Force puts the total cost of the program at $30 billion
to $40 billion.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar, due to the extensive
use of exotic composite materials, some of which absorb rather than
reflect radar waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a
cross-section that offers a very small profile to radar.
   The plane is a ``flying wing,'' a design resurrected from the
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. The B-2 displayed Tuesday was gray on top and black
beneath.
   Nobody was allowed to see the B-2 from the rear, presumably
because revealing the design of its engine exhaust system might help
enemy detection efforts.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge Jr. told the
gathering the program's expense represents an investment in safety.
   ``Let all of us remember America's enduring hope and prayer that
the B-2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent
aircraft will never be flown in anger,'' Aldridge said.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones saluted employees of his
company and of subcontractors who have worked on the project for a
decade, unable to describe their work.
   ``For years, they've been working in a kind of honorable exile,''
Jones said. ``They persevered, and now you can see what it's all
been about.''
   The first flight on most airplanes is six to 12 weeks after
rollout, but Air Force officials refuse to commit to a date for the
first flight of the B-2.
   One of the U.S. senators at the ceremony, Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
said budget contraints could force a ``stretch out' of stealth
bomber production, although he noted that influential Democrats like
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., give the program bipartisan backing.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said: ``Here, today, with the unveiling
of the stealth bomber, I have never felt better about the deterrence
of America. I think we've got a great airplane.''
   ``It has the potential to render obsolescent a very great
investment in Soviet air defenses,'' Wilson said.
   As the bomber was towed out of a massive hanger, an Air Force
band broke into the stirring ``Stealth Fanfare,'' composed for the
occasion by Tech. Sgt. Allen Yankee, 35, of McMinnville, Ore., a
saxophonist in the band.
   The B-2 project was launched by former President Jimmy Carter.
Critics, including the private Union of Concerned Scientists, say
the B-2 deployment, planned for the early 1990s, would hamper arms
control efforts by posing a greater threat than current planes to
enemy command posts and mobile missiles.
   The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration bomber, as
opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate enemy air
defenses at low altitudes.
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52 it is designed to replace.
   Flight tests will begin _ probably early next year _ at Edwards
Air Force Base, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave
Desert. The Air Force said the maiden flight will be the short hop
from the plant at Palmdale to Edwards.
   The bomber, which has inspired intense curiosity among aviation
buffs, has already inspired models, and a mockup appears in a
current automobile commercial.

<TEXT>
   The judge in the Iran-Contra case agreed
Tuesday to consider Oliver L. North's objections to deleting
sensitive references from classified documents prosecutors want to
use as evidence.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell scheduled closed hearings
beginning Nov. 30 ``and continuing thereafter from day-to-day as
long as necessary'' to discuss the proposed deletions of references
to sensitive matters, including the names of countries, foreign
officials and U.S. intelligence agents.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has proposed deleting the
references from the 350 documents he wants to use as evidence
against the former presidential aide to protect U.S. intelligence
operations and relations with foreign countries.
   An interagency task force that reviewed the material has agreed
to allow Walsh to use the documents as evidence in a public trial if
the sensitive references are deleted.
   Gesell said North ``should be prepared to explain why a proposed
redaction (deletion) is relevant and material for his defense'' to
charges he conspired with former White House national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and two arms dealers to illegally divert
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The closed hearings will be held under provisions of the
Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA, which regulates the
disclosure of secret documents as evidence in court.
   The judge's brief order made no mention of North's proposal to
disclose the contents of some 40,000 pages of classified material in
3,500 secret documents.
   Walsh has asked Gesell to declare the list of documents North
proposed as defense exhibits legally insufficient and bar him from
introducing any of these papers into evidence.
   The prosecutor contends that North proposed many of the documents
as exhibits simply to provoke the government to drop the charges to
stem disclosure of some of the nation's most sensitive secrets.
   At a hearing Monday, Gesell seemed to signal that he would grant
Walsh's motion, saying ``intervening events make it wholly
unnecessary to discuss any scheduling of in camera (closed)
proceedings on North's CIPA filing notice, and therefore I have no
intention of scheduling such hearings, and that's a moot matter.''
   In his order scheduling hearings on the prosecution documents,
Gesell said he had reviewed many of the papers Walsh wants to use as
evidence against North.
   Many of the deletions Walsh proposes ``appear designed to excise
the identity of countries mentioned and communications with named
individuals, including officials of such countries and United States
agents in the field.''
   ``Almost without exception, North objects to these categories of
redactions,'' the judge said, referring to a portion of the
defense's secret filing on classified documents.
   Gesell directed Walsh to devise alternative method to
substituting the names of countries and individuals with letters or
numbers. ``The court finds, upon examination of the papers, that
this masking technique appears unduly cumbersome and likely to
prevent easy reading of the text.''
   The 350 documents Walsh wants to use as evidence comprise between
1,000 and 2,000 pages of classified material.
   No date has been set for North's trial, but Gesell predicted at
Monday's hearing it could begin in late January.
   At that proceeding, Gesell appealed to President Reagan to decide
whether he wanted the case to go to trial, warning that he could
have ``very little control'' over the testimony of current and
former officials who will be questioned about covert operations.
   Poindexter and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord
are to be tried separately.

<HEAD>Bhutto, Rival Meet With President</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Populist leader Benazir Bhutto and her
conservative rival met separately Tuesday with Pakistan's president,
who is to decide which one will lead a new government.
   Ms. Bhutto's party took 93 seats in last week's National Assembly
elections. The right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance, a coalition
headed by Nawaz Sharif, took 55 seats.
   Each leader claimed to have the backing of enough independent
candidates and minor parties to form a majority in the 237-seat
legislature. If named prime minister, Ms. Bhutto would be the first
woman to lead an Islamic nation.
   Ms. Bhutto declined comment after meeting President Ghulam Ishaq
Khan. Sharif told a press conference following his meeting that ``we
will demonstrate our majority'' in a vote of the newly elected
National Assembly.
   Neither he nor Ms. Bhutto have revealed specifics of how they
would form a majority, however.
   Sharif said he told Ishaq Khan to let a vote of the Assembly
determine the majority before a prime minister is named.
   To nominate a prime minister ``simply because a group has more
seats is unfair,'' said Sharif. ``We want a natural majority rather
than a contrived majority.''
   In a meeting Monday with caretaker ministers, Ishaq Khan said the
transfer of power will occur ``in a matter of days,'' according to
the official news agency APP. Wasim Sajjad, the caretaker justice
minister, announced the National Assembly will convene Dec. 5.
   Pakistan's Constitution contains two clauses regarding the naming
of a prime minister.
   One gives the president discretion both in timing and selection
of a Cabinet leader. The other, intended to apply to elections after
1990, requires the assembly to convene first, then determine the
prime minister through a majority vote.
   Ms. Bhutto contends the 1990 provision should be applied now
because the polls scheduled for 1990 in effect were moved up to 1988.
   But Sajjad's announcement suggests that whatever course Ishaq
Khan takes, the naming of a prime minister will occur after Dec. 5.
   The full legislature will contain 237 seats _ 207 for Moslems, 10
for non-Moslems, and 20 exclusively for women. The women will be
elected by the assembly Dec. 5.
   It means Ms. Bhutto's party needs the votes of 26 more members
for a simple majority, compared with 64 more for Sharif's group,
which includes loyalists of late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   Zia died in an Aug. 17 plane crash only weeks after calling
elections, but on a non-party basis. Ms. Bhutto's party took its
case for party-based polls to the Supreme Court and won.
   Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, in a 1977 coup. Bhutto was hanged two years later after a
court convicted him of conspiring to kill a political rival.

   An intense storm pounded Oregon and caused power outages where
winds ripped through at up to 75 mph Tuesday, while western Florida
residents were preparing for Tropical Storm Keith.
   Up to 5 inches of rain was expected over the Florida peninsula.
Tropical storm warnings were in effect along the Florida coast from
Cape Sable to Cedar Key, and a tropical storm watch was issued on
the East Coast up to Savannah, Ga.
   An intense low off the British Columbia coast brought wet and
windy weather to Washington, Oregon and northern California.
   As the storm slammed into the coast, wind gusts reached 75 mph at
Tillamook, Ore., 70 mph at Seaside and 69 mph at Newport.
   A spokesman for the Central Lincoln Public Utility District said
winds knocked a tree down on a power line, cutting off electricity
to five small towns. Gary Cockrum said about 3,000 customers were
without power intermittently.
   More than 4 inches of rain was reported in Shelter Cove, Calif.
   A winter storm warning was issued for the Cascade and Olympic
mountains of Washington, where up to 12 inches of snow were expected
Tuesday afternoon.
   In Idaho, snow advisories were in effect with accumulations of 4
to 5 inches expected in the northern and southwest mountains, and 6
to 12 inches forecast for the central and southwest mountains.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included
nearly 2 inches at Crescent City, Calif.; an inch at Blue Canyon,
Calif.; and two-thirds of an inch at Daytona Beach, Fla.
   Sunny skies prevailed from the central and southern Plains across
the middle and lower Mississippi Valley into western sections of the
Ohio Valley.
   Afternoon temperatures were generally in the 40s and 50s with
readings in the 60s from southern Texas to southern Mississippi.
   Lower temperatures were reported from the Northeast to the Great
Lakes, with readings in the 30s and 40s. Dense fog held temperatures
in the 20s in South Dakota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota, to 84 degrees at
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The nation's low Tuesday morning was 0 at
Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for rain, with snow in higher
elevations, from the northern and central Pacific Coast across the
northern and central Plateau to Idaho. Scattered rain showers and
snow showers in the mountains were expected in Montana and Utah,
with snow in Wyoming and scattered snow showers in the mountains of
Colorado.
   A cold front combined with Tropical Storm Keith was to spread
scattered showers and thunderstorms from Florida to sections of
Georgia and Alabama. Rain was expected in some parts of the
Carolinas and into Virginia. Sunny skies were to prevail from the
central and southern Plains across the middle and lower Mississippi
Valley and the Ohio Valley to New England.
   Highs were forecast in the 30s in Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota
and Washington. Readings were to reach the 60s and 70s from the
Atlantic coastal states across the lower Mississippi Valley, the
central and southern Plains, parts of the southern plateau and
southern California. The rest of the nation could expect highs in
the 40s and 50s.

   A former security aide for political
extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr. told a federal jury on Tuesday that
LaRouche's chief fund-raiser ordered that loans to his organizations
not be repaid.
   In testimony that supported the heart of the government's case,
Charles Tate said fund-raising chief William Wertz told staffers
``there was no such thing as a loan.''
   Tate said LaRouche fund-raisers would try to have loans converted
to contributions and, if unsuccessful, not repay them unless they
was a ``political downside'' or threatened lawsuit.
   In testimony backing another count against LaRouche _ tax fraud
conspiracy _ Tate testified the security staff performed ``maid and
butler'' chores, serving food, cleaning LaRouche's residences,
caring for his wife's dog and horses, and handling grocery shopping.
   LaRouche and six associates are accused in the U.S. District
Court case of conspiracy and mail fraud, allegedly for raising more
than $30 million in loans with no intent of repaying them. LaRouche
also is charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS by filing no
returns since 1979, while having all personal expenses paid from
funds of various corporations he controls.
   Tate quoted Wertz as saying the general population ``owed us the
money and we had to get it from them.''
   ``Who else said that?'' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Markham.
   ``Mr. LaRouche,'' Tate said of the three-time unsuccessful
presidential candidate.
   Tate, who quit the LaRouche staff after the alleged remarks about
the loans in 1984, said Wertz _ a defendant in the case _ envisioned
himself as World War II Gen. George Patton.
   Wertz, according to Tate, constantly exhorted LaRouche staffers
to ``take the beachhead'' and ``capture the bridges,'' and sometimes
played the soundtrack of the movie ``Patton'' starring George C.
Scott.
   Earlier, prosecution witnesses testified that they lent a
LaRouche organization money for an anti-drug book but never got
their money back.
   Two witnesses, Elizabeth Sexton, 75, and Lita Witt, 87, said they
knew little aboutthe political maverick and his causes but wanted to
make an investment in the book, titled ``Dope, Inc.''
   A third witness, computer firm employee Gerald Lee Corbin,
testified he was a contributor to LaRouche before and after making
his loan.
   But all three said they were solicited by LaRouche fund-raisers
repeatedly for their loans and often were promised they would be
paid back with interest.
   Ms. Sexton said she was told by a LaRouche fund-raiser that her
money was safer with the LaRouche organization than with her bank
because ``the banks are our enemies.''
   The defendants contest the charges, saying they planned to repay
the loans but were prevented from doing so when government and news
media attacks on their operations forced them to divert money to
defend themselves.
   Corbin, of Irvine, Calif., testified that he lent $10,000 in
December 1985, to Caucus Distributors Inc., which prosecutors have
described as a LaRouche-controlled organization.
   Corbin said LaRouche fund-raiser Paul Greenberg, a defendant,
promised him 12 percent interest and agreed to repay the principal
and interest within seven days of a request from Corbin.
   But Corbin said that when he needed the money in January 1986,
for a down payment on some property, he was unable to get it back
and Greenberg did not return some 30 phone calls.
   ``It was never my intent for it to be a gift,'' he said.
   Corbin acknowledged he had contributed to LaRouche's political
movement before making the loan and continued doing so right through
this year, when LaRouche made his third try for the presidency.
   ``I wanted to keep on the good side of the LaRouche
organization,'' Corbin said in explaining why he continued to make
the contributions. ``I still had hopes of getting my $10,000.''
   Ms. Witt, who said she lent Caucus Distributors $10,500 in 1985,
testified that her sole purpose was to invest in the book.
   ``I didn't understand it was a political movement,'' she said.
``I was investing in their book. I am not a supporter (of LaRouche).
I have never been.''
   Ms. Witt, of Dallas, said she attempted repeatedly to get her
money back, but was unable to do so.
   Preceding Ms. Witt's testimony, Ms. Sexton said that in a
desperate attempt to get back the $112,800 she lent the LaRouche
organization, she wrote LaRouche himself and received a written
response in May 1986. ``He talked about their plight,'' she said.
``I wanted him to talk about my plight. I tried to explain my
plight, too.''
   LaRouche was indicted in October on 13 counts of mail fraud,
conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the IRS.
Conviction on all counts could carry a prison term of 65 years and
fines of $3.25 million.
   The six other defendants face lesser sentences if convicted of
the mail fraud and conspiracy charges.
   The co-defendants are Wertz, chief fund-raiser; chief LaRouche
legal adviser Edward Spannaus and four fund-raisers: Michael
Billington, Dennis Small, Greenberg and Joyce Rubinstein.

   The General Assembly voted on Tuesday for
an end to colonialism by the 21st Century, with only the United
States opposed, and also condemned South-Africa's rule over
South-West Africa.
   The resolution to declare 1990-2000 the International Decade for
the Eradication of Colonialism passed the General Assembly by 135
votes to one, with 20 nations abstaining.
   U.S. Ambassador Patricia M. Byrne later explained that the United
States voted ``no'' because it rejects the General Assembly's claim
to jurisdiction over the Pacific Trust Territory, also known as
Micronesia, where America has military bases on Guam.
   ``Article 83 of the U.N. Charter makes clear that jurisdiction
over strategic areas ... lies exclusively with the Security Council
and Trusteeship Council,'' she said, lashing out at ``these
delegations that continue to bring their tired propaganda to the
General Assembly.''
   She did not name the delegations, but the Soviet bloc and
socialist nations routinely denounce U.S. military installations in
the Pacific and elsewhere.
   A resolution castigating South Africa for its 73-year rule of
neighboring South-West Africa _ or Namibia _ passed 147-2, with
seven abstentions. Britain joined America in voting against it.
   South Africa has been stripped of its General Assembly vote since
1974 for its policy of racial segregation, called apartheid.
   Monitoring decolonization and trusteeship over territories that
are not self-governing has been a major mission of the United
Nations since its founding.
   When the United Nations was established in 1945, 750 million
people lived in such territories, dependent on colonial powers.
   By 1985, more than 80 former colonies had gained independence and
fewer than 3 million people lived in non-sovereign territories. Most
of those could live in independent nations in the near future.
   Namibia's 1.5 million residents and Western Sahara's 117,000
people could gain self determination under two U.N. independence
plans in the works.
   About 550,000 residents of the former Portuguese colony of East
Timor in the Indonesian archipelago are unlikely to be independent
soon. Indonesia invaded and seized East Timor in August 1975, and
has shown no inclination to give it up.
   Britain continues to keep its colony on the Falkland Islands,
saying its 1,800 residents wish to remain British subjects.
   The remaining territories, held by Britain and the United States,
are tiny islands with potential strategic significance.
   Britain and the United States submit annual reports to committees
of the Trusteeship Council on social, economic and educational
progress in their possessions.
   Puerto Rico was removed from the U.N.'s list of
non-self-governing territories in 1952, when it adopted its present
constitution and commonwealth status, and relinquished its
territorial status.

   A U.N. anti-apartheid group said Tuesday it
is investigating 48 alleged violations of a voluntary embargo on oil
shipments to South Africa aimed at undermining that country's system
of racial segregation.
   It also said some world corporations have helped the Pretoria
government obtain oil, although they are not covered by the embargo
and are not violating national laws.
   The second annual report by the U.N. Intergovernment Group To
Monitor Supply and Shipping of Oil to South Africa said the vast
majority of the world's oil producing states prohibit exporting oil
to South Africa.
   It called the embargo, adopted by the General Assembly in 1984,
an important means of pressuring South Africa to dismantle
apartheid, because that nation is dependent on imported oil. The
embargo is voluntary and the world body has no enforcement powers.
   ``However,'' it said in a statement, ``some transnationals like
British Petroleum, Caltex, Mobil, Shell and Total have helped South
Africa obtain oil, and British Petroleum and Shell are allegedly
still involved in oil imports to that country.''
   In 1988, the report said, the group received reports of 64
alleged violations involving 32 ships. Sixteen cases were withdrawn
and ``the remaining 48 cases are still under suspicion and our
investigation,'' it said, without giving specifics.
   ``The imposition of a mandatory oil embargo by the Security
Council against South Africa is urgently needed to complement the
arms embargo imposed by the Security Council,'' the report said.
   It also noted, ``There are a number of transnational corporations
that have assisted South Africa in its coal conversion to oil and
hydrocarbon exploration projects ...
   ``When the threat of an oil embargo began to loom and the
apartheid regime decided to expand its coal exports, a new occasion
of collaboration between the regime and international oil companies
arose.
   ``The oil companies are granted access to cheap coal in return
for their cooperation in evading the oil embargo.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Thousands of people gathered in Dealey Plaza on
Tuesday, bringing flowers, silently praying and remembering the day
25 years ago when President John F. Kennedy was killed as his
limousine passed the grassy knoll.
   ``We are here because this is an important place in Dallas, an
important place in history, what happened here 25 years ago,'' said
schoolteacher Jean Hill, who was also at the site on Nov. 22, 1963.
   ``Although this was a traumatic event, I want them to feel they
are a part of America's history,'' said Hill, who brought about 50
youngsters to the scene. ``Also, I want my kids to know it does not
take violence of any kind to bring about change and that they
themselves can be instruments of change and it can be good.''
   Dallas held no official ceremony to mark the anniversary of
Kennedy's death at 12:30 p.m., but 2,500 people filled the downtown
plaza where the president was shot as he waved to crowds from the
back of an open limousine.
   About 20 people clapsed hands in a loose chain along the
motorcade route. Someone put a crucifix and two bouquets on Elm
Street at the approximate point where Kennedy was hit. A note on one
said, ``We still miss you _ Nov. 22.'' Another said, ``After 25
years, we still love you, John.'' Traffic backed up as cars pulled
into different lanes on the one-way, three-lane street to avoid
hitting the impromptu memorial.
   Alvin Marin, 52, said the cross he placed in the street was the
same one he grasped upon hearing of Kennedy's death 25 years ago.
   ``It's just something to remember him by,'' Marin said. ``This is
very emotional.''
   A few knelt in prayer in the stone memorial to Kennedy a few
blocks away, while others snapped pictures of the memorial and the
Texas School Book Depository Building, where police found Lee Harvey
Oswald's rifle.
   Members of the Kennedy family observed the anniversary in mostly
private services. They have asked people to mark his birthday on May
29 instead of his assassination.
   Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis attended a private Mass in New York
City along with her son, John, and daughter, Caroline. Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass., laid a white rose on a monument honoring his
brother in Runnymede, England.
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the late president's sister, visited his
grave and that of her brother Robert, at Arlington National Cemetery
in Virginia and said she hopes people remember ``the high points of
his life, the laughter and the vision.''
   While people walked in the plaza below, reporters got a rare
glimpse through the window on the sixth floor of the book depository
building where Oswald was believed to have fired the fatal shots.
   That floor, now in a county office building, rarely has been
opened. It is being converted to a museum by the Dallas County
Historical Foundation and is expected to open Feb. 20, President's
Day.
   Students from the University of Texas at Arlington explored
assassination theories as they toured the Dealey Plaza landmarks.
   ``When the Warren Commission report came out, it just didn't set
well,'' said Jim Marrs, who has taught the class, ``JFK
Assassination Conspiracy Revealed,'' since 1976. ``It became real
apparent that all that could be said about it had not been said.
   ``The interest is there. Everyone would like to know what really
happened.''
   Recollections also were shared at Parkland Memorial Hospital,
where Kennedy was treated and died. The hospital sponsored a
roundtable discussion among three doctors and two nurses who were
involved in Kennedy's treatment.
   ``It was as hopeless as anything we ever worked on,'' said
Charles Baxter, who was directing the emergency room when Kennedy
was brought in. ``The emotion in the room would have said to try and
do something, even though it was a hopeless situation.''
   After pronouncing Kennedy dead, Baxter said the staff fell silent.
   ``Everybody knew it,'' he said. ``Nobody had to say anything.''

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement Reached at Chicago Sun-Times</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the Chicago Sun-Times and its
editorial employees reached tentative agreement on a three-year
contract Tuesday without any of the pay concessions that had
prompted a strike threat.
   The union's executive committee unanimously recommended approval
of the pact, which includes a flat $500 payment in the first year
and 3 percent raises in the remaining two years for the
approximately 250 reporters, editors and photographers who are
members of the Local 71 of the Chicago Newspaper Guild.
   A ratification vote was scheduled for Nov. 29.
   ``It would have been unprecedented if we didn't get some type of
remuneration for the first year,'' said union spokesman Dan Lehmann,
who also is the Sun-Times' religion writer. ``It would have set a
pattern for accords across this country that the guild simply could
not let happen.''
   He declined to discuss other provisions of the proposed deal,
including such sticking points as an affirmative action plan and who
is exempt from the contract.
   ``I want our members to read the contract before they read
anything about it,'' he said.
   Sun-Times spokesman Michael Soll said the newspaper's management
was pleased with the settlement.
   ``We just want to get things back on track,'' he said.
   The union had set a strike deadline of 2:30 p.m. Monday, but
postponed any action while negotiations continued throughout the
day. The last management proposal put to the union late Monday
offered a wage freeze for the first year, followed by 3 percent
raises in the next two years.
   Following a 2{-hour meeting, union members voted to ask Sun-Times
bargainers to return to the table and make some improvements.
   ``I think that meeting made it clear that a substantial majority
was willing to walk out if that was the company's final offer,'' he
said. ``I think that's when the company sensed the seriousness of
the situation.''
   The Sun-Times' initial bargaining stance included a 15 percent
pay cut over two years, but that was modified to a 3 percent pay cut
for 18 months, followed by restoration of current pay for the
balance of a three-year pact.
   The pay scale at the newspaper ranges from $625 a week for
starting reporters to $895 for reporters with five years' experience.
   Union members have been working without a contract since June 1.
A strike would have been the first by Sun-Times editorial workers in
the newspaper's 40-year history.
   The Sun-Times said it must control costs to remain competitive
with the larger Chicago Tribune, which has an estimated circulation
of 765,000 daily and 1.11 million Sunday.
   The Sun-Times, whose circulation is estimated at 605,000 daily
and 614,000 on Sundays, was purchased from Rupert Murdoch for $145
million in June 1986 by a group of investors led by the New York
investment firm Adler & Shaykin.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan has no intention of
taking action to stop the trial of former aide Oliver M. North on
charges related to the Iran-Contra affair, a White House spokesman
said Tuesday.
   One day after U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell said that Reagan
has the constitutional authority to stop the trial, likely to begin
in late January, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that ``we
don't have any direct role'' in the case.
   North has been indicted on charges of conspiring with others to
defraud the government in connection with a behind-the-scenes
attempt to use proceeds from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran to assist
the rebels fighting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.
   ``I still think Ollie North is a hero,'' Reagan said at one point
last March, while predicting that North and former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter would be acquitted of the charges brought
against them.
   But more recently, Reagan and top White House aides have refused
to discuss whether the president might grant a pardon to North. With
less than 60 days remaining in Reagan's term, such a move would seem
impossible in light of the president's determination to see the
trial proceed.
   Reagan, when asked Monday whether he was nearing a decision on a
North pardon, replied, ``No, no. And I don't think it would be any
time to make such a decision while it's still before the courts.''
   Earlier Monday, Fitzwater had told reporters aboard Air Force One
on the trip to California, ``I maintain that no one knows what the
president's thinking on this is.''
   But when asked about this again Tuesday, the spokesman replied
tersely, ``We aren't discussing pardons.''
   Judge Gesell had noted that if the trial proceeded, it could
result in the public release of a wide array of sensitive or
classified government information. The judge said he felt Reagan
should decide whether he wants to withhold certain documents likely
to be used either by the prosecution or the defense in the case.
   Asked whether Reagan felt he had any role in notifying the court
of his views about evidence that might be used in court, Fitzwater
said, ``We don't have any direct role, no.''
   ``Our role at the moment is to work the courts ... in reviewing
the classified information,'' he said. ``As Judge Gesell pointed out
... President Reagan called for this investigation in the beginning.
... We have said yesterday, and on previous occasions, that the
president's position on pardons was that he believes the legal
process should be allowed to take its course _ and we are not
discussing pardons.''
   Fitzwater said that the White House, in fact, had been working
``to review classified information that has been designated by the
prosecution and by the defense. And we have declassified _ or
reviewed and declined to declassify _ thousands of pages of
documents that have been provided by both sides in the case. And we
will continue to do that.''
   Fitzwater said he understood that the judge was merely reminding
Reagan of his constitutional authority to thwart the trial if he
wished to do so, but said ``that is not the president's intention.''
   The spokesman also said that ``we have not asked for executive
privilege (to protect secrets) at any point in this case. It has not
been an issue.''
   ``The problem is now on the defense side, where the defense has
introduced thousands of new documents that they believe are germane
to the case, that would have to be reviewed as well,'' the spokesman
said.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru, (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels launched a mortar attack
Tuesday on the Lima headquarters of the national security police and
raided an isolated mountain town, capping a four-day wave of
violence that has killed 41 people.
   Authorities said one policeman was killed, three were wounded and
two were missing in the raid on the mountain community of Cotahuasi,
335 miles southeast of Lima. They said rebels of the Maoist-inspired
Shining Path guerrilla movement carried out the raid.
   No one was reported injured in the Lima attack by the pro-Cuba
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movemement.
   Shining Path guerrillas dynamited three power pylons late Monday
near Huancayo, 125 miles east of Lima, knocking out power and using
the cover of darkness to bomb three banks and a police station.
Police said no one was hurt.
   Power also was cut in Lima, the capital; parts of Lima state, and
sections of five other states on Peru's central coast and mountains.
The state power company Electro-Peru said power was restored to most
capital areas in minutes.
   The attacks followed one of the heaviest rounds of violence in an
eight-year insurgency that has killed more than 12,000 people.
   Health Minister Luis Pinillos warned residents in this city of
six million that Lima's water supply had become contaminated due to
``problems in the supply of electric energy'' late Monday.
   In a statement he said a power outage halted the operation of
purification equipment, allowing drinking water to mix with
contaminated water and rendering the entire supply unfit to drink.
   He said the problem would be solved soon but warned residents to
boil water at least 10 minutes before drinking. It did not
specifically refer to the rebel-caused power outage.
   Interior Minister Juan Soria said four Tupac Amaru rebels
directed mortar fire shortly after dawn Tuesday at the headquarters
of the national security police, Peru's main anti-guerrilla force.
   He said two shells gouged chunks from the outside wall of the
office building, which also houses the regional administrator's
office and a state police garrison. It is in a walled, block-square
compound in downtown Lima.
   He said a third shell exploded on the roof of a Chinese
restaurant.
   Earlier violence included:
   _Two firefights between troops and the Shining Path guerrillas
Sunday and Monday that left 10 of the Maoist guerrillas dead in the
rural countryside near Ayacucho, 230 miles southeast of Lima.
   _A Shining Path attack on the farming village of Tupe, 90 miles
southeast of Lima, before dawn Monday. Rebels killed five village
officials after accusing them of supporting the government in the
insurgency.
   _The deaths of 15 guerrillas and seven soldiers in a battle
Sunday near Abancay in the Andes Mountains 320 miles southeast of
Lima _ one of the bloodiest single clashes in the insurgency.
   _An attack by the Shining Path late Saturday that killed two
policemen near a hydro-electrical plant in the mountains near
Huancayo.
   _The death of Shining Path chieftain Ruben Dario Muelle Gongora
in a shootout with police Saturday in Sicuani, 420 miles southeast
of Lima.
   The mortar attack followed the arrest Monday of Saul Cantoral,
leader of a month-long mining strike that has paralyzed the mineral
industry. Union leaders said security police was holding Cantoral.
   Last week, Tupac Amaru guerrillas bombed the Lima headquarters of
the National Mining Society, an association of private mine owners,
in support of the striking miners.
   Soria said police and rebels traded shots moments after the
attack, but the insurgents escaped in a station wagon.
   Tupac Amaru is smaller and considered less violent that Shining
Path. It endorses Cuban-styled Marxism and has been active since
1984, mainly in cities.

   One of the seven bodies unearthed in
the yard of a Victorian boardinghouse had been beheaded, and its
hands and feet were cut off, a coroner said Tuesday.
   ``It was missing the feet and hands and head. We don't know if
the mutilation occurred before or after death,'' said Sacramento
County Coroner Charles Simmons. He said the body was that of a
woman, 50 to 60 years old, and was the only body that had suffered
``obvious physical trauma.''
   Dorothea Montalvo Puente, 59, the landlady who ran the two-story
house, has been charged with one count of murder in the death of
Alvaro ``Bert'' Montoya, a mentally handicapped transient and former
tenant who has been missing for months from Puente's home.
   Prosecutors are considering whether to charge her with additional
counts, said police spokesman Sgt. Bob Burns. District Attorney John
Dougherty declined to discuss the case.
   Simmons, whose office has completed autopsies on all seven
bodies, said none of the victims matched Montoya's description.
   ``From what I've seen, we haven't found anybody who matches this
description,'' Simmons said, ``but some of them were very
decomposed.'' Only one of the bodies has been identified and the
causes of death are still unknown.
   James Beede, a toxicologist with the coroner's office, said
authorities were searching for evidence of poison as a cause of
death, but declined to provide specifics. ``There was some evidence
uncovered at the scene for particular substances we are looking
for,'' Beede said. ``I can't say what substances we're looking for.''
   Earlier in the day, police met with Social Security officials to
obtain the records of 16 missing tenants of Puente's boardinghouse.
Police want the payment records of people who were reported missing
after living at the home, hoping to determine whether their Social
Security checks were improperly cashed.
   Authorities have accused Puente of killing elderly boarders and
hiding their bodies to collect their Social Security checks. She
said in a television interview after her arrest last Wednesday that
she didn't kill anyone but admitted, ``the checks I cashed, yes.''
   The only body identified was that of Benjamin Fink, 55, described
by his family as a chronic alcoholic and transient who moved into
Puente's home earlier this year.
   According to court documents, another boarder told police that
Fink disappeared after he became drunk and ``Dorothea told him that
she would take him upstairs and make him feel better.''
   Police said in sworn statements filed in Sacramento Municipal
Court that searches of the boardinghouse have turned up carpet
stained with blood and a handwritten book that may be Puente's diary.
   During two searches of Puente's home, police seized various
papers, photographs and books, including a paperback titled ``The
Smell of Evil.'' Among the seized papers are some ``pertaining to
funeral plots.''

   A powerful explosion tore through the
headquarters of the paramilitary Civil Guard shortly before midnight
Tuesday, killing one person and wounding 45, officials said.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera said a small van parked on
the sidewalk next to the Civil Guard headquarters exploded at 11:48
p.m. (5:48 p.m. EST) in a residential neighborhood.
   He said the dead man was an unidentified civilian.
   Corcuera said there were unconfirmed reports that the blast
killed a 2-year-old boy who had been riding in a car with his father
and mother, a surgeon and a nurse, when the blast occurred.
   Corcuera said the mother, who was reported in very critical
condition, could be pregnant.
   He said about 45 people suffered injuries and that most had been
treated for cuts and bruises and released. He said about 10 people
still were hospitalized in critical condition.
   The minister said the occupants of the van parked it on the
sidewalk and immediately ran towards another waiting vehicle that
drove away. The van exploded shortly afterwards.
   The getaway vehicle was located a short time later in a nearby
park, where police destroyed it as a precaution.
   A Civil Guard spokesman said 141 Civil Guards lived in the
barracks.
   Witnesses reported nearby buildings were heavily damaged,
including a convent and a restaurant. Callers throughout Madrid told
radio stations they heard the blast.
   No one immediately took responsibility, but suspicion fell on the
militant separatist organization ETA, the acronym for ``Homeland and
Liberty'' in the Basque language.
   Police in Bilbao in northern Spain said an explosion at a French
auto dealership happened about an hour before the Madrid blast,
causing extensive damage but no injuries.
   Officials said they believed the Madrid explosion was caused by a
car bomb filled with explosives parked near a dormitory for Civil
Guard cadets.
   The ETA exploded a car bomb at the same building in May 1987,
killing a woman passer-by.
   The organization has claimed at least 600 victims, many of them
Civil Guards, in its 20-year campaign to gain independence for the
three-province northern Spanish Basque country.
   On Nov. 2, the ETA offered to stop attacks for 60 days if the
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez agreed to begin
discussions in Algeria over the future of the Basque country.
   Gonzalez dismissed the offer as a ``macabre ploy.'' The offer was
made three days after the ETA released a businessman held hostage
for 248 days.
   Gonzalez and President Francois Mitterrand of France were to meet
Wednesday at an annual Franco-Spanish summit in Montpellier, France.
Ways of dealing with ETA terrorism was one item on their agenda.
   So far this year ETA has claimed responsibility for 14 deaths.
   On Dec. 11, a car bomb set by ETA at a Civil Guard barracks in
Zaragoza killed 11 people, including five children. In June 1987,
ETA exploded a car bomb in a Barcelona supermarket that killed 21
people, all of them civilians.

   Former President Chun Doo-hwan
apologized to the nation Wednesday for human rights abuses and
corruption under his harsh rule and said he was surrendering
millions of dollars.
   ``I am pained and ashamed of my past. I have no intention at all
to make an excuse,'' Chun said in a nationally televised, 30-minute
address.
   Chun, who said he was taking responsibility for all misdeeds
under his rule, ended by saying, ``My dear people, I am really
sorry.''
   About 50 radical students armed with iron rods and firebombs
tried to break through thousands of riot police around Chun's house
in Seoul right after he spoke, apparently to stop him from leaving,
but Chun already had left for rural exile.
   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!,'' the students shouted as police
dispersed them.
   Chun told the nation he would not try to defend or explain his
past actions and deeply regretted the abuses under his government.
   Many Koreans have been demanding Chun be arrested and tried for
abuses and corruption during his seven-year term that ended in
February. Opposition groups staged violent protests as anger over
Chun mounted.
   President Roh Tae-woo, another former general and associate of
Chun, is trying to defuse the crisis without damaging his
government's position.
   Chun left his home right after the speech to go into exile some
place in the countryside.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said Chun and his wife were
going to a Buddhist monastery in the mountains east of Seoul. Rural
exile is a traditional Korean form of atonement for disgraced
officials.
   Roh must somehow satisfy public indignation against Chun while
distancing his government from past abuses.
   Some opposition groups have called for Roh's resignation or
overthrow, contending the government is a front for military rule
and part of the system erected by Chun.
   To atone, the 57-year-old Chun said Wednesday that he was
surrendering all his personal property, including his house and
land, about $3.3 million in cash and membership in two golf clubs.
   Chun also said he was returning about $20 million in surplus
political funds left over at the end of his term. He said he did not
have any property or money hidden overseas, even though he knew many
people would not believe him.
   Chun, a former general, took power with military backing in 1980.
He has denied any personal corruption, but about a dozen of his
relatives and associates have been convicted or charged with
embezzlement and other crimes.
   He said Wednesday he took responsibility for all wrongs committed
under his government. ``For all the misdeeds and mistakes committed
in the seven years of office, I am responsible because I was the man
who held ultimate responsibility for state affairs,'' he said.
   Chun specifically apologized for the forced dismissal of
government officials and journalists when he took power; the deaths
of opposition supporters who were sent to harsh re-education camps;
and corruption and embezzlement by relatives and associates.
   He made a special apology for the bloody 1980 suppression of an
uprising by students and citizens in the southern city of Kwangju
that left about 200 people dead. He called it a ``tragedy.''
   He said in turning his property over in atonement, ``I am now
turning this over. I hope this property and assets will be disposed
of in accordance with the people's wishes and desires.
   ``This is all I have. There is nothing hidden.''
   Many observers doubted that Chun's apology would defuse the
public anger against the former president. Large numbers of Koreans
want Chun punished for his harsh rule and demand a full, legal
accounting of his rule.
   A National Assembly committee probing the bloody military
suppression of the Kwangju uprising voted Tuesday to subpoena Chun
to explain his role in the incident.
   Opposition lawmakers on the committee ignored pleas from
government members to wait until Chun made his statement to the
nation Wednesday before deciding whether to proceed with a subpoena.
The committee voted 16-12 to subpoena Chun, with members of the
governing Democratic Justice Party voting against.
   Roh indicated he is considering pardoning Chun after Chun
apologized, according to South Korean press reports. But government
officials indicate they will initiate a probe against Chun if the
apology fails to quiet public anger.
   Chun was a senior general and in effective control of the
government when troops quashed the uprising by citizens and students
in Kwangju. Dissident groups claim up to 2,000 people were killed.
   Assembly committee officials indicated Chun would be summoned in
early December. He would face prosecution if he did not obey the
subpoena.

   A bomb blew up outside the office of the
defense minister Tuesday night, killing three bodyguards and
critically wounding three others, authorities said.
   A communist guerrilla group claimed responsibility.
   The bomb, activated by remote control, had been placed by a
lamppost outside the Defense Ministry.
   The blast destroyed a van with three bodyguards and wounded three
guards who were traveling on motorcycles, the Defense Ministry said.
   Defense Minister Manuel Jaime Guerrero Paz, who was traveling in
an armored vehicle, was not hurt by the blast, the ministry's press
office said.
   In telephone calls to radio stations, the pro-Soviet guerrilla
group Revolutionary Forces of Colombia claimed responsibility for
the blast.

   Police arrested the leader of a
militant transportation union on Wednesday morning after he
threatened to expand a strike by drivers of passenger jeeps,
authorities said.
   Deogracias Espiritu, secretary of a drivers' association known as
PISTON, had threatened to broaden the walkout after President
Corazon Aquino refused the group's demands for an immediate
reduction in commodity prices or a freeze in fare reductions.
   A relative said Espiritu was arrested at his home before dawn
Wednesday. Gen. Alfredo Lim, Manila's police chief, confirmed the
arrest and said Espiritu would be charged with inciting to sedition.
   Espiritu was the second union leader arrested since PISTON, which
represents thousands of passenger jeep drivers, launched a transport
strike Monday in Manila and Cebu. PISTON President Medardo Roda was
arrested Monday and charged with inciting sedition.
   Passenger jeeps are the main form of land transport in the
Philippines.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary's Capital Command, said he ordered the arrest of strike
leaders who allegedly pressure other jeep drivers to join the
walkout.
   ``If we have ordered the arrest of striking drivers who harrass
non-striking drivers, then we should also arrest the leaders since
these drivers are just following orders,'' Aguirre said in a radio
interview.
   Mrs. Aquino met Tuesday with representatives of the transport
industry and promised to set up a commission to study drivers'
complaints. She said the commission would complete its study within
30 days.
   But she made no commitment to reduce commodity prices and
rejected a demand to suspend a government-ordered reduction in
passenger fares pending cuts in the price of auto parts.
   Drivers have said they are demanding cuts in commodity prices,
but so far have specified only reductions in auto parts.
   Later, Espiritu told reporters that drivers could not wait for
the study and would expand their strike Wednesday.
   Elementary and high schools in Manila were closed Wednesday in
anticipation of the strike, but police said traffic appeared normal
during the morning rush hour.
   Espiritu said two other drivers associations would join the
walkout, but Manila radio stations said they changed their minds and
decided to work Wednesday.
   Espiritu said drivers in Angeles and the Bicol region of
southeastern Luzon island would join the strike. No reports emerged
from those areas early Wednesday.
   In previous transport protests, militants were successful in
getting large numbers of drivers to join on the first day of a
strike but participation dwindled afterward because many operators
could not afford the loss of revenue.

   President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a
Harvard graduate, said Tuesday he expects Mexico to have better
relations with the United States when Yale graduate George Bush
takes over.
   The two men hit it off well, said to Salinas advisers who were
present at the first meeting of the two presidents-elect at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   ``Based on the terms of this meeting,'' Salinas told reporters on
the flight back from Houston, ``I expect a much better
relationship.''
   After the meeting, both men termed good relations essential to
the two countries and acknowledged that the two most important
problems they must work on are drug trafficking and Mexico's foreign
debt.
   ``They (the United States) will work on the problem of
consumption and Mexico will fight trafficking,'' Salinas said.
   Drug trafficking has been a sore point in Mexican-U.S. relations.
U.S. officials often charge that corruption by Mexican officials
facilitates the drug trade, while Mexico says trafficking flourishes
because of the market for narcotics in the United States.
   Both men were accompanied by their economic advisers, underlining
the emphasis both place on economic matters, especially a Mexican
foreign debt that now stands at $102 billion.
   Salinas said he stressed that Mexico needs to renegotiate the
debt because it needs money for development. This year Mexico has
paid nearly $9 billion in interest alone on the debt.
   The Mexican president-elect said it is imperative for Mexico to
grow again and that growth will help solve several Mexican-American
problems, including the illegal migration of Mexicans to the United
States in search of jobs.
   In a joint communique, the two said they recognized that ``the
solidarity and understanding of the United States is essential for
Mexico'' to find ways to allow this country to develop.
   Salinas told reporters he and Bush agreed to start Cabinet-level
meetings between their treasury secretaries on the debt shortly
after Salinas takes office Dec. 1. Although Bush does not take
office until Jan. 20, he announced plans to keep Nicholas Brady as
treasury secretary.
   Bush said both he and Salinas were committed to improving their
relationship, which he said he considered essential for the United
States.
   Salinas said he found the U.S. president-elect's attitude
``positive and cordial.''

   The parents of a 7-year-old girl were
arrested Tuesday and charged with murder in her strangling, more
than two months after they reported she had been stolen from her bed
while they slept.
   David Dowaliby, 31, Jaclyn's adoptive father, was arrested on his
way to work Tuesday; Cynthia Dowaliby, 26, was arrested at their
home, said Lisa Howard, a spokeswoman for the Cook County state's
attorney's office.
   The couple's 4-year-old son, David, was placed in custody of the
state Department of Children and Family Services, police said.
   The arrests were staggered to avoid traumatizing the boy, said
Paul Greves, chief of police in Blue Island, where Jaclyn's body was
found.
   Both parents were charged with first-degree murder, he said.
   Greves would not comment on evidence leading to the arrests.
   The Dowalibys were to appear at a pre-trial hearing Wednesday in
Cook County Criminal Court.
   Jaclyn's body was discovered in a patch of weeds on the edge of a
wooded area in nearby Blue Island a few days after she was reported
missing Sept. 10. Authorities say she had been strangled.
   Police at first believed the child had been abducted from her
home in this southwest Chicago suburb, but later said the
investigation had been expanded to consider other possibilities.
   Mrs. Dowaliby told police she had checked Jaclyn in her bedroom
late Sept. 9 and that her husband discovered the child missing about
8 a.m. the next morning. Police said a basement window was broken
and the front door of the home was ajar.
   ``The fact that there was nothing disturbed in the house, no
signs of violent struggle, nobody heard anything, that brings to
mind ... questions,'' Midlothian police Capt. John Bittin said at
the time.
   The investigation slowed when the Dowalibys ceased to answer
additional questions from authorities. Their attorney maintained the
family was being harassed and had told police all they knew.

<HEAD>Panama To Continue Bank Restrictions Through Mid-1989</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Banking Commission
extended banking restrictions through the middle of next year, but
eased rules governing withdrawals during December, the government
announced Tuesday.
   A banking crisis here resulted from U.S. actions against the
Panamanian government controlled by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
after Noriega's indictment in the United States on drug trafficking
charges. Noriega denied the charges.
   Banking restrictions _ originally to last for three months after
banks shut down by the government reopened in May _ will continue
through June 30, 1989, a banking commission news release said.
   Customers will not be required to request withdrawals 30 days in
advance in December. The 30-day petition rule will go back into
effect in January.
   The commission, a governmental regulatory agency, permanently
eased restrictions effective Dec. 1, by raising the amount customers
can withdraw from savings accounts each month to 10 percent of the
account, with $100 as the maximum monthly withdrawal. Withdrawals
had been limited to 5 percent a month, up to a maximum of $50.
   Rules affecting checking accounts _ limiting monthly withdrawals
to 50 percent up to a maximum of $50,000 _ remain unchanged.
   The commission predicted that despite continued restrictions, the
National Bank of Panama and other official banks will disburse about
$28 million from Christmas savings accounts in December.
   The commission said it will continue to analyze the banking
system's actions with an eye to ``advancing toward the total
re-establishment of the normal functioning of the banking system.''
   Runs on banks began in late February when Noriega forced out
President Eric Arturo Delvalle hours after the president tried to
fire the general. As head of the Defense Forces, Noriega is Panama's
de facto ruler.
   A U.S. freeze on $50 million in Panamanian government funds
deposited in the United States left the National Bank of Panama, the
central bank, unable to cover large withdrawals.
   The government ordered banks shut March 3 and allowed them to
reopen May 9.
   The 115 banks operating under general licenses are affected by
the government restrictions.
   In July, the banking commission extended restrictions until the
end of the year. Under the latest commission decree, the
restrictions will continue through June 1989.

   A three-judge panel ruled Tuesday Louisiana
has failed to set up an acceptable integration plan for its colleges
and universities and ordered that a special master put one together.
   The panel earlier this year ruled the state had allowed
``unlawful'' segregation to persist in the schools despite a 1981
consent decree that was to end racial bias.
   Tuesday's ruling dissolves the consent decree.
   ``The Court does not mean to preclude continuing settlement
discussions ... Thus, the parties are welcome to submit ... a
consensus plan,'' said the order.
   ``They bent over backward to let all parties work together,''
said Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   The judges scheduled a Feb. 15 trial unless an acceptable plan is
presented to the court before then. An acceptable plan likely will
include a single board to govern all the schools, the judges said.
   The state currently supports three systems, each with its own
governing board, which are controlled by a super-regulatory agency
known as the Louisiana Board of Regents.
   None of the four boards wants to relinquish authority.
   ``They said one of the best reasons for a single board is a
status conference like this one _ 14 lawyers instead of one. ... The
expense of what we're doing now could have hired countless faculty
members,'' Roemer said.
   Roemer said he expects the judges to appoint a special master in
the next few days.
   The panel consisted of Judge John M. Wisdom of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals and Judges Charles Schwartz and Veronica D.
Wicker of the U.S. District Court.
   The judges in August said that ``despite the slight increase in
black enrollment statewide, the racial polarization has increased as
a whole during the term of the consent decree.''
   The judges found that of Louisiana's 20 institutions of higher
education, those originally established as ``black'' schools _
Southern University-Baton Rouge, Southern-New Orleans,
Southern-Shreveport, and Grambling _ remain predominantly black.
   It said that with the exception of two community colleges,
Louisiana was continuing to operate an unlawful, dual system of
public higher education.
   The 1981 consent decree was intended to resolve a 1974 lawsuit
the Justice Department filed against the state.

<TEXT>
   The Army plans to shoot missiles toward
the space shuttle during a 1990 mission to test key technologies of
the Strategic Defense Initiative, officials said.
   The Star Wars experiment, called Starlab, is designed to
demonstrate that sensors can distinguish between a rocket and its
exhaust plume and then point a laser and hit the missile, Lt. Col.
D. Voorhees told reporters on a tour of the Army Strategic Defense
Command in Huntsville Monday.
   The missiles will be designed to miss the shuttle by more than
100 miles.
   The Strategic Defense Command will supply five four-stage rockets
called Starbirds to be launched toward the shuttle during a
seven-day unclassified Defense Department mission scheduled for
Sept. 10, 1990, said Voorhees, chief of the Starbird project office.
   Low-power lasers aboard the shuttle will be trained on a flat,
3-by-6-foot target card on the fourth stage of the Starbird.
   The shuttle will carry a crew of seven, including two Air Force
payload specialists already selected. They will be trained at the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville.
   The Air Force Systems Division is in charge of the mission.
Others participating, in addition to NASA and the Army, are the Navy
and the Massachussetts Institute of Technology.
   Because it is the first time any object has been launched at the
shuttle, the Army missiles must fly a trajectory designated by NASA
and the Army must prove that trajectory in a demonstration flight to
insure safety, Voorhees said. One static firing has been completed
successfully and another is planned for December.

   The recently resigned head of Soviet space
research says his country's maiden space shuttle launch had
``absolutely no scientific value,'' and the U.S. and Soviet shuttle
programs are in ``deep trouble'' economically.
   Roald Z. Sagdeev, who headed the Soviet Space Research Institute
for 15 years, said last week's inaugural Soviet shuttle flight _
like the 1981 flight of the first U.S. shuttle _ was an
``outstanding technological achievement.''
   The shuttle, however, ``is technology of the 21st century. Why
should we pay 20th century money for it?''
   ``My personal view is that American experience with the shuttle
indicates that from the point of view of cost efficiency, the
shuttle is in deep trouble,'' said Sagdeev, who has followed closely
the U.S. decision-making process on the shuttle and is a key science
and arms control adviser to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

   The Air Force is bringing the B-2 stealth
bomber, the crown jewel of its super secret ``black inventory,'' out
from behind the veil of secrecy that has shrouded it for a decade.
   The high-technology flying-wing aircraft, designed to penetrate
enemy radar defense and drop nuclear bombs, was being unveiled today
by Northrop Corp. at a rollout ceremony _ although at a secure
distance of 200 feet.
   ``It is simply not comparable to anything ever done before. It is
the first real computer-age aircraft,'' Northrop spokesman Les Daly
said Monday in one of the aerospace company's first public
pronouncements about the B-2.
   Daly referred to an aircraft that has not yet flown and which the
General Accounting Office estimates could cost taxpayers up to $68.5
billion if the Pentagon builds the 132 aircraft-fleet sought by the

   The judge in the Iran-Contra case says
President Reagan should consider the ``various courses of action he
may take'' to stop the trial of Oliver L. North to prevent national
security secrets from being disclosed.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell did not say that Reagan
should consider pardoning the four Iran-Contra defendants but
suggested other means by which the trial could be stopped.
   He said that under the Classified Information Procedures Act,
Reagan could declare that the danger of disclosing highly sensitive
government secrets was so great that the charges must be dropped.
The president, as the nation's chief law enforcement officer, could
either directly order the case dropped or he could invoke secrecy
laws to prevent disclosure of classified information, which could
have the same effect.
   ``The Constitution does not permit the court to take this
testimony in secret, as did the Congress. It must be public,''
Gesell said, adding he would have ``very little control over the
content of the testimony.''

<HEAD>Aquino Government Blamed for Things that Go Wrong in Philippines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines has just gone through
a nightmare of storms, sinking ships, communist rebels escaping
captivity and foodstocks vanishing.
   Parts of the nightmare can be explained by bad luck, including
three tropical storms that killed more than 600 people in two weeks.
   But some Filipinos lay it at the door of President Corazon
Aquino's government, charging that it lacks organization, resources,
efficiency to keep things in order _ and accountability.
   ``It is not enough that the president sets the example,'' the
Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper said recently on the issue of
accountability. ``She should also find the strength and conviction
to make examples of officials who do not measure up.''
   The most graphic example was the escape Nov. 12 of the alleged
chief of the Communist rebel army. The military says Romulo
Kintanar, 41, and his wife Gloria, 38, were allowd to attend a
birthday party for a former stockade commandant and they simply
walked away.
   The acting stockade commander, Maj. Benjamin Landrito, offered
maintained that he was unaware Kintanar and his wife were allowed to
leave their cells because he was asleep in his office at the time.
   It was not the first security problem at the stockade at Camp
Crame, which includes the headquarters of the Philippine
Constabulary.
   Kintanar's host, Lt. Col. Robelito Comilang, was suspended in
October when a rightist army officer, Lt. Col. Francisco Baula,
reportedly walked through three doors that were supposed to be
locked, climbed the stockade wall and was on his way when guards
finally shot and killed him.
   That followed an incident in June, in which dozens of armed men
tried to free former Gov. Orlando Dulay, jailed in the 1986 deaths
of several Aquino supporters. Raiders failed to free Dulay but made
off with armory weapons.
   Mrs. Aquino has demanded a full investigation into Kintanar's
escape. Three senior officers, including Landrito and Comilang, have
been relieved and restricted to quarters. But some Filipinos are
skeptical.
   ``There has not been any real investigation, much less real
punishment of people concerned,'' fumed Sen. Ernesto Maceda,
chairman of the Senate Defense Committee. ``There is a tendency to
cover up. In the spirit of comradeship, they just cover up the
incident to control the damage.''
   Maceda's doubts were based on the failure of previous
investigations to fix responsibility, punish those responsible and
implement changes.
   Commissions failed to solve the assassination in September, 1986,
of labor leader Rolando Olalia, the killing in August, 1987, of
Local Governments Secretary Jaime Ferrer and the slaying in
September, 1987, of leftist leader Lean Alejandro.
   Another commission organized after January 1987 killing of 13
land reform protesters by soldiers guarding the presidential palace
never established who gave the order to fire.
   The senior officer on duty during the shooting, Brig. Gen. Ramon
Montano, was furloughed as the capital's regional commander during
the investigation. But months later, he was promoted to major
general and given command of the Philippine Constabulary, the
country's national police.
   Three separate commissions investigated the December 1987
collision of the passenger ship Dona Paz with an oil tanker, in
which more than 3,000 people are believed to have perished.
   All three commissions found evidence of widespread inefficiency
in the maritime industry, including overloaded ships, lack of
adequate communications, poorly trained crew and the absence of
effective search and rescue procedures.
   But Commodore Carlito Cunanan, who as coast guard commandant was
responsible for maritime safety, was promoted to navy commander
after the Dona Paz disaster.
   In October, the Dona Marilyn, another passenger ship owned by the
same company, sailed into Typhoon Ruby and sank with 500 people
aboard, about half of whom are still listed as missing and feared
dead.
   Although the investigations into the second sinking have not been
completed, officials say they have found evidence of many of the
same shortcomings which led to the Dona Paz disaster.
   ``The country is one big Dona Marilyn sinking in the middle of a
storm while the captain snores on top of a mahjong table,'' wrote
Francisco Tatad, a frequent administration critic. ``Many (heads)
should roll.''
   In September, Emil Ong, chairman of the National Food Authority,
was furloughed and then fired after two investigating committees
found evidence of widespread incompetence.
   The committees cited, among other things, the disappearance of
$350,000 worth of rice, which Ong said sank on three barges. The
coast guard said it had no record of the sinking.
   Two days after Ong was dismissed, he was named presidential
adviser for regional government affairs.
   That prompted columnist Luis Beltran to joke in the
pro-government Evening Star newspaper that ``going on leave'' had
become a new civil service status ``in which incompetents are
prepared for promotions.''

   Timothy Daly says he could easily have followed
in his sister's footsteps, playing a cop on TV. He's no cop, but he
does take over from Tyne Daly when his new CBS show, ``Almost
Grown,'' moves into the old ``Cagney & Lacey'' time period next week.
   The one-hour series, which has a special two-hour preview Sunday,
is an ambitious, multiera drama about one couple, seen as
teen-agers, as college students and as divorced adults. The plan is
that each episode will begin in the present, then flash back to one
of the other eras.
   ``I've been offered a lot of television, and I'm thankful for
that. I shouldn't sound snotty about it, and I don't mean to be,''
Daly, 32, said in an interview. ``It's just that there's a lot of
stuff on TV that people were interested in having me do that to me
was not acting.
   ``I really wanted to do something unique, because how many guys
on television have pointed a gun and said, `Freeze!' It's like there
are 85 guys on TV saying `Freeze' any night of the week. I don't
want to do that. Of course, my sister did it, too. She pointed a gun
and said `Freeze,' but she was a woman, that was the difference.''
   Timothy Daly starred in the 1982 sleeper hit film ``Diner'' but
has done his proudest work on the stage, most recently in ``Coastal
Disturbances'' off Broadway.
   In 1983, he co-starred in the short-lived TV medical drama
``Ryan's Four.'' This time, he may have a winner. ``Almost Grown''
is one of the better offerings among the meager selection of good
new shows this season.
   Although different in style and premise, ``Almost Grown'' sounds
like the CBS answer to ABC's appeal to baby boomers,
``thirtysomething.'' The comparison bugs Daly.
   ``I think it's a good and ambitious show, but the only similarity
I can see (with `thirtysomething') is that it's intelligent
television,'' he said.
   ``I don't think it's a `baby-boomer' show. I think this show can
appeal to anyone who likes rock 'n' roll, which is ages like 10 to
50, so that's quite a wide range.''
   The show plays to the fact that a lot of Americans have now grown
up with rock music, and their passion for it can turn a golden oldie
into a painfully evocative memory.
   Daly plays Norman Foley. Eve Gordon plays girlfriend-wife-ex-wife
Suzie.
   The pilot flashes back to their meeting in high school, when Norm
is a goody-goody and Suzie is running around with the local hood.
   By 1971, they are living together off campus. He's a deejay on
the university radio station, she aspires to be a documentary
filmmaker. They consider marriage only after Norm's appalled parents
offer to buy them a car if they will tie the knot.
   By the 1980s, Norm and Suzie have two children and a divorce.
Suzie, a technical filmmaker for a medical lab, is about to marry an
irritatingly well-adjusted cosmetic surgeon who donates his skills
to penniless victims of disasters. At the wedding, Norm suddenly and
without provocation hauls off and belts the groom. Then ensues a
typical real-life fight between two guys who don't know what they
are doing and are hoping not to hurt each other. The flash of fists
quickly dissolves into a flood of apologies.
   ``I think the reason the characters are likable is because
they're flawed,'' said Daly. ``They're just struggling along like
the rest of us. They're not holding themselves up as anything,
they're just trying to get through. They have these emotional
responses to things that get them in trouble.
   ``I look forward to seeing if we can make some good TV shows,''
Daly said. ``If we can't, I hope it dies a quick and painless death,
but if we can, I can see doing it for a while.''

<HEAD>The Question: To Tax or Not To Tax</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An effusion of post-election proposals to raise
taxes has created an illusion that only President-elect George Bush
and the American electorate are opposed.
   The proposals have come from such diverse sources as former
presidents, the financial community, the news media, organized
labor, academics, groups committed to social causes, members of
Congress, foreign interests and others.
   The avowed concerns of all center on the belief that the federal
budget cannot be balanced in the near future through economic growth
alone, but must have an assist from more austere tax policies.
   The proposals, including those of former Presidents Ford and
Carter, have developed relentlessly in the two weeks since Bush was
elected president on a platform that included a promise of no income
tax increase.
   So great has been the outpouring that some conservative groups
have begun reasserting their anti-tax increase philosophy.
   Summarizing an analysis issued this week, Stephen Moore of the
Heritage Foundation, which was influential in the Bush campaign,
stated: ``The facts are on Bush's side. ... there is no reason for
him to retreat from his pledge.''
   Moore, a Heritage fellow in federal budgetary matters, contends
that if Congress simply holds spending growth to a rate less than 4
percent a year the deficit will be eliminated by 1993 without a tax
increase.
   Among reasons for optimism, Moore said, is that the flow of red
ink already is subsiding from a peak of $220 billion in fiscal 1986
to $148 billion in fiscal 1989. Economic growth already is outpacing
the deficit, he said.
   More important, he said, was evidence that the deficit as a share
of total economic output is likely to fall to 2.9 percent of gross
national product in 1989 from 6.3 percent in 1983.
   In support of his argument, Moore said that federal taxes already
are at record-high levels, that new taxes mean higher spending
rather than lower deficits, and that a major tax hike would slow
economic growth and threaten recession.
   He said that taxes will consume 19.6 percent of GNP in 1990, a
level reached in only five years of this century and that federal
spending since 1948 has increased $1.58 for every dollar of tax
increase.
   The cleavage in views between those aggressively encouraging
higher taxes and those vehemently opposed produces something of a
comprehension gap for ordinary Americans. There is very little
moderate ground or agreement.
   Speaking for the American Agenda, a bipartisan group they headed,
Carter and Ford said they saw no prospect whatever of a balanced
budget by 1993 simply through spending cuts, even though they
searched assiduously for some hope.
   Bush, on the other hand, seems to have committed himself to
follow through on his promise of no major tax increases, presumably
relying on the prospect of healthy economic growth eventually
overwhelming the deficit.
   Convinced that such a scenario will unfold, Moore said members of
``the pro-tax lobby'' have been consistently wrong in their
predictions about the course of the economy during the Reagan
administration, and will be wrong again.
   In 1982, he said, they argued Reagan's tax cuts would cause high
inflation, but inflation declined; in 1983 they said deficits would
force interest rates higher, but rates fell sharply; during the 1984
presidential campgain they promised a recession unless taxes were
raised, but expansion continued.
   Most recently, he added, they insisted the federal debt would
cause the loss of U.S. business and jobs to foreign competitors, but
corporate profits and employment levels in the United States rose to
all-time highs.
   ``They seem completely unable to learn from their mistakes,''
Moore concludes. ``Bush should ignore them. Their advice is as bad
now as it has been during the past eight years.''

<HEAD>Author Up For National Book Award 25 Years After Winning First</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARREN MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.F. Powers became a writer because he
couldn't find a decent job during the Depression. In the 52 years
since, he's published five books, two of which were novels.
   The first, ``Morte D'Urban,'' won the National Book Award in
1963. The second, ``Wheat That Springeth Green,'' has been nominated
for the prize this year. He's up against another previous winner in
the fiction category, Don DeLillo (``White Noise,'' 1985), whose
novel ``Libra,'' about Lee Harvey Oswald and the assassination of
President Kennedy has been nominated.
   The three other writers nominated in the fiction category for the
prize, to be announced Nov. 29, are: Pete Dexter, whose novel
``Paris Trout'' concerns the murder of a 14-year-old black girl by a
white man in a small Georgia town just after World War II; Mary
McGarry Morris, whose first novel ``Vanished'' is about a couple who
kidnap a toddler and embark on a five-year flight from justice; and
Anne Tyler, for ``Breathing Lessons,'' which concerns a long-married
couple and the detours they take on the way to the funeral of an old
friend in Pennsylvania.
   ``Wheat That Springeth Green'' is the story of a priest who
balances his desire for a contemplative life against the day-to-day
chores of running a parish.
   ``I don't write a lot,'' Powers said in an interview. ``When I
was first starting to write, I didn't realize I would only have
published five books by age 71. I didn't know how hard writing was
going to be for me.''
   It all started when he was a 19-year-old in Chicago and couldn't
get a good job after graduating from high school in 1936.
   ``I couldn't get into college because I didn't have the money and
I wasn't a particularly good student,'' he recalled. ``So I worked
in bookstores and I read a lot. I had the idea that maybe I could do
something of that kind.''
   But it wasn't until 1943 that his first work, a short story about
jazz musicians called ``He Don't Plant Cotton,'' was published in
Accent magazine, a literary quarterly put out by faculty members at
the University of Illinois.
   In addition to his novels, Powers has published three collections
of short fiction and has been a regular contributor to The New
Yorker and other magazines.
   Though most of his work has dealt with the lives of priests, the
author, a widower with five grown children, never wanted to enter
the clergy.
   ``I considered the priesthood as something I didn't want to do. I
didn't want the responsibility for other people. I had enough to do
with my own life,'' said Powers, who teaches creative writing at St.
John's University in Collegeville, about 75 miles northwest of
Minneapolis.
   ``A priest can't really cut loose with most people because they'd
be shocked. He has to act as if everybody he meets is doing a
wonderful job. He has to be all things to all men, like a
politician. He is a politician.''
   Powers, however, is no politician; he calls things as he sees
them. Using the Catholic Church as a background in his writing has
provided a convenient path for getting his message across.
   ``I think for me, it's a way of getting at what is important _
what all of us are doing here,'' he said. ``Are we getting old so we
can move to Florida? Is that it?
   ``I don't think so. I want to believe as any animal does that
when he dies there's going to be more, that things will be better.''
   In ``Wheat That Springeth Green,'' Powers speaks through Joe
Hackett, a track star who enters the priesthood in hopes of becoming
a mystic and making a direct connection with God. Instead, in
situations ripe with comic satire, Father Joe finds himself running
a parish, helping people with their problems and drinking a lot of
alcohol.
   ``I've been criticized for not putting my characters in really
dramatic situations. I don't want to do that. I don't want to have
the girl tied to the railroad tracks with the train coming and the
Mountie racing to the rescue. I'd rather, if I can, suggest the same
kind of terror in the little things,'' he said.
   ``I'm trying to give people fingerprints of their own and not
just have biblical characters who represent greed, beauty and
sinfulness. I want them to be people such as my readers might really
be themselves.''

<HEAD>Hollywood Turns Off Karate Kid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralph Macchio is the kind of person who prefers
natural grass to artificial surface. No wonder the actor chooses to
live far away from Hollywood.
   ``I'm sort of locked away from it,'' said Macchio, a resident of
Long Island. ``I'm somewhat turned off by all the handshaking. You
play the game, everybody plays the game, but it gets old fast. I
just choose to be away from it.''
   But Macchio loves to act. His latest film, ``Distant Thunder,''
gives him a chance to play opposite one of the best, John Lithgow.
   ``When I work with an actor, I will rent his previous films,'' he
said. ``I saw `The World According to Garp'; he was incredible.
`Terms of Endearment,' he worked five days on that film and he gets
nominated for an Academy Award, that's my kind of deal!''
   Macchio, a very young-looking 27, plays a high school senior in
``Distant Thunder.'' Lithgow plays his father, a Vietnam veteran who
abandoned his infant son and now wants to re-establish a
relationship.
   ``It's not a true story about one person but it's based on a
group of real events, real veterans and their experiences. It's 1988
and the war still goes on,'' said the actor.
   Macchio had to research the part. ``I met with a kid who was 18
and hadn't seen his father for eight or nine years. His father was a
veteran. I talked to him a decent amount of time. He was very
helpful.''
   And he tried to find motivation from his own father as well.
``I'm very close to him and I tried to imagine if he wasn't there. I
remember him saying `Don't shorten up on the bat' at Little League.
I just imagined not having that.''
   Fans may be most familiar with Macchio's starring roles in ``The
Karate Kid'' and ``The Karate Kid II,'' box-office smashes that have
grossed over $200 million. And yes, there will be a ``Karate Kid
III,'' but Macchio, fulfilling a contractual obligation, is
approaching the film with mixed feelings.
   ``I'm somewhat looking forward to it,'' he said with a thin
smile. ``The people like it, it's a good story. The first film
really turned out nice. I think we owe it to the public and it will
be nice to complete the saga.''
   Macchio was born and raised on Long Island. He didn't do much
acting as a youngster; dancing was his first love.
   ``When I was a little kid, I liked Gene Kelly movies. I took
dancing lessons from 2{ to 15 or 16. My parents read it was good for
kids. It helped in making `The Karate Kid,''' said the actor, whose
karate moves at times resembled dance steps.
   In 1977, a local casting agent, Marie Pastor, saw him perform at
a dance recital and encouraged him take up acting. His first feature
film was ``Up the Academy,'' in 1980, but his real break came three
years later with ``The Outsiders.''
   Macchio was a teen-ager when he read the S.E. Hinton novel and
was desperate to get the part of Johnny. ``I remember thinking, `I
need this,''' he recalled.
   He was turned down for the part but learned that Francis Ford
Coppola was directing and vowed to try again.
   ``Then there was no way I wasn't getting it,'' Macchio laughed.
``I auditioned and I got the part. Coppola wanted me to read for
some other parts and I said, `No.' I still love that movie. It's
something special _ my first real role.''
   He followed with ``The Karate Kid,'' ``Teachers'' and
``Crossroads.'' In 1986, Macchio's career took a drastic change of
pace when he starred opposite Robert De Niro in the Broadway play,
``Cuba and His Teddy Bear.''
   ``When I first met De Niro, I was nervous as hell,'' Macchio
said. ``I wanted the part, I wanted to do theater and I wanted to
work with him. But after the first two days, you relax. You're all
actors trying to create reality through someone's words.''
   Having worked with an actor of De Niro's caliber, Macchio felt at
ease around Lithgow.
   ``I wasn't intimidated by him. He's what I describe as a
shoot-from-the-hip kind of guy. When it's time to do the work, he's
right in it. When it's time to take a break, he's a lot of fun. I'm
the same way. I think the scenes we have together are really
strong.''
   For the future, Macchio would like to raise a family with his
wife, Phyllis, a nurse, and continue to grow as an actor.
   ``To try to be believable is the challenge of it. It's one of the
few professions where you get to see the work,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   As children growing up in East Los Angeles, the
members of the rock band Los Lobos listened to their parents' music,
the folk music of Mexico. As might be expected, the effect was
profound.
   ``As soon as we were tall enough to get to the knob on the radio,
(we'd say), `Hey, no more of that stuff, Mom,''' recalls drummer
Louie Perez. The knob would spin. ``This is what we're listening to.
... Rock 'n' roll.'''
   Eventually, the knob spun back. As teen-agers just out of high
school, Perez and his friends recreated those traditional Mexican
songs for weddings, dances and the like, and then melded them with
their second love _ rock _ to invent the sound that characterized
their first three albums.
   Now, after scoring a commercial hit with the soundtrack to the
movie, ``La Bamba,'' Los Lobos has come back again to their roots.
The band's new LP, ``La Pistola y El Corazon'' (``The Pistol and the
Heart'') is a rousing, loving sampler of the traditional music of
Mexico.
   ``We've always wanted to do something like this,'' Perez said in
an interview before a concert at Carnegie Hall. ``And the timing
just seemed to be right.''
   Some might doubt that last statement, as Perez acknowledged. ``A
lot of people I've talked to have said, `Why do you want to do
something like that now? You'd want to follow up the big hit,
wouldn't you?'
   ``And I'd say, `Not really.' We've always stayed away from the
predictable and the obvious sort of thing. And for us, this is a
real artistic sort of step. And that's sort of a reaction to the
commercial ... success that we entertained last year. It's our way
of responding to that in a constructive, more responsible, artistic
way.''
   For the album and the 11-city tour that followed, the band used
only traditional, acoustic instruments _ violin, accordion, upright
bass, plus guitarron, jarana, hidalgarron and other relatively
exotic instruments rarely heard, or even heard of, in this country.
   They also purposely varied the song selection to give U.S.
audiences a taste of Mexico's different regional styles _ Veracruz,
Huapango, Michoacan and so forth.
   ``We wanted to expose music from Mexico that's relatively unknown
to most people _ kind of shatter the myth of Mexican music as just
mariachi music,'' Perez said.
   There was one concession to the non-Mexican market _ the album is
short, just over 25 minutes long, because the band ``didn't want
anybody who was unfamiliar with this music to get burned out.''
   The band members also had hoped to offer the album at a special
low price, but Warner Bros. _ which otherwise was supportive and
agreeable to the project, Perez said _ wouldn't go for it.
   According to Perez, sales of the album in its first few weeks
have been satisfying _ nearly 100,000 copies. The band's next step,
after recouping for the holidays, will be to get back into the
studio for another rock 'n' roll album that should be out in late
spring.
   Meanwhile, the members of Los Lobos are having fun introducing
Norteamericanos to the music of their parents, the music of their
heritage.
   ``That's pretty much what we've always set out to do _ do
something that represents who we are, our identity,'' Perez said.
``In a way, this record is showing some vulnerability and I think
people appreciate that. Letting people know this is who we are, this
is what we've done and this is the music that got us going.
   ``This is the stuff that was around my house when I was a little
kid. And you might be from Minneapolis and maybe there was something
else around when you were a little kid. But maybe it's worth it to
check it out.''

   A helicopter flying in the Persian Gulf last
summer only wanted to shoot film for NBC News, but a U.S. destroyer
almost blew it out of the sky when the crew failed to respond to
repeated warnings.
   News helicopters around the world are becoming more aggressive in
their quest for the best pictures. Pilots and officials now are
taking steps to avoid disaster, to strike a balance between the
First Amendment and public safety.
   Following last May's $7-million Redondo Beach pier fire near Los
Angeles, news pilot Bob Tur was criticized for fanning smoke and
flames, endangering firefighters, and hampering radio communications
with noise.
   ``We can be a pain,'' acknowledged Tur, who is currently
appealing a 180-day license suspension for an unrelated infraction.
   But he denied he hovered too close, and said that wasn't the real
reason for his problems. ``People sometimes don't want publicity.
But if the media didn't tell you, who would?''
   More news choppers are buzzing the skies above big news events,
from earthquakes to chemical spills. Often, it's the only way
television crews or newspaper photographers can grab pictures of a
distant sea rescue or landslide before deadline.
   Not too long ago, only the three major television stations in Los
Angeles and the Los Angeles Times used helicopters, said Mike
Dreesman, whose Helitac Aviation currently flies for The Associated
Press and other news organizations. Nowadays, photographers from
such publications as the National Enquirer spend hours each week
airborne.
   ``We ask (the news helicopters) to back off and most of them are
pretty polite about it,'' said Sgt. Brent Carey of the police Air
Support Division. ``Others are pretty persistent. They want to keep
taking their pictures and at times it becomes an annoyance.''
   These days, teamwork among helicopters begins to play a more
important role _ and that's not the most common trait in such a
competitive business.
   ``There's no problem in and around a major event when pilots
communicate,'' said Bob Pettee, who flies for KNBC-TV. ``The only
problem is when somebody does something unexpected.''
   Pettee said experienced news pilots can shoot a chemical spill
without stirring up toxic gas, stay far enough away from a hostage
situation to avoid exciting a gunman, and cooperate with other
pilots on the scene.
   Sometimes they even help officials by tracking fires or flying
out victims, he said.
   Complaints were common before the Federal Aviation Administration
limited flights around disasters in 1985, the FAA's Joann Sloan
said. The restrictions allow local officials to ask the FAA to
declare fires, crashes and other incidents off-limits to aircraft
for safety reasons.
   News aircraft are permitted only if they file a flight plan, fly
above rescue aircraft, obey on-site authorities, and follow other
rules.
   Los Angeles fire and law enforcement officials said they
coordinate coverage with news helicopters as they show up on the
scene.
   ``I think the FAA thinks they have things under control,'' said
Ms. Sloan. ``We haven't had any disasters occur with these (news)
helicopters that I know of anytime recently.''
   But last December Jim Burnett, then-Chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, cited helicopter problems in asking the
FAA to tighten controls around disaster sites.
   Burnett cited six incidents since 1974 where news helicopters
worsened hazards or hampered rescue efforts. These included stirring
up fumes and dust around spills of hazardous materials, a fatal
crash over a chemical fire, and distracting ground rescue crews.
   ``These incidents illustrate how non-rescue aircraft can
interfere with rescue and clean-up activities and endanger the lives
and health of the occupants of the aircraft, the victims of the
accident, and the emergency response personnel responding to the
fire or hazardous materials incident,'' Burnett wrote.
   FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor declined to issue new rules in
March, but he pledged the FAA would impose a 180-day license
suspension for pilots ignoring flight restrictions.
   Tur knows all about such suspensions. The pilot, whose company
sells videotape to several television stations, ran into trouble
with federal officials in March 1987 over the Air National Guard jet
fighter crash that killed Dean Paul Martin, son of entertainer Dean
Martin.
   The FAA honored a request by search officials to issue flight
restrictions around the crash site in the San Bernardino Mountains
east of Los Angeles, according to testimony at a suspension hearing
last September.
   Tur was warned away from the area by an Air Force colonel on the
scene. But he flew by to shoot late afternoon pictures of searchers
combing the steep, brush-filled mountainside for debris and bodies.
Other news crews were escorted over the scene at a higher altitude.
   Tur contended that flights were restricted only to avoid
publicity.
   ``Never can a local, state, or federal agency prevent news media
representatives from flying into an area because public relations
doesn't want the story told,'' he said.
   But Col. Charles K. Cross, the Air Force officer at the site,
testified news helicopters posed a safety threat. He said Tur's
noisy flight ``significantly disrupted my coordination efforts'' by
distracting searchers, and jeopardized their safety.
   Like Tur, the late Leo Galanis of Denver's KUSA-TV, who was head
of the National Broadcast Pilots Association, felt the Martin crash
site was restricted merely to curb publicity.
   ``I think it's obvious if it was not Dean Martin's son there
would not have been a (restriction) in effect,'' Galanis said in an
interview a few weeks before his own death in a helicopter crash.
   Galanis and cameraman Brian Hostetler were returning from
covering a plane crash Oct. 19 when their helicopter became
entangled in a utility cable and crashed southwest of Denver. Both
men were killed.
   Blocking or limiting media helicopters, Galanis said in the
interview, ``prevents the public from seeing events that they're
entitled to see under the First Amendment.''

   Emergency shelters house a growing throng of
homeless Americans, but the need now, in the words of a National
Academy of Sciences study, is for ``a stable residence'' for those
who have none _ in other words, permanent housing. Noting that
federal funds for low-income housing have been cut by more than
three-quarters since 1981, advocates say the need for lasting
shelter is critical. Some see potential in unused government-owned
houses and in the shells of once-sturdy buildings that stand vacant
in inner cities.

   Taxpayers around the nation own tens of thousands of houses
standing empty. At the same time, tens of thousands of American
families with nowhere to live overflow shelters and haunt the
streets.
   Now the homeless and some of the publicly owned vacant homes are
being brought together _ in a project that is housing families from
the Minnesota cold, in a clandestine effort to renovate and occupy a
dwelling in Chicago, in New York City's restoration of entire
tumbledown blocks.
   Activists, while encouraged, are pressing housing officials to do
more, and a major decision could come in federal court next week.
They say the government is skirting a law that pledges available
space to those without homes.
   ``I think thousands of buildings could and should be usable,''
said Robert Hayes, counsel for the National Coalition for the
Homeless in New York, a city that owns, mostly through tax default,
5,000 empty apartment buildings with many times that number of
apartments and has an estimated 60,000 homeless people.
   One of the abandoned buildings was on Leggett Street in a sorry
corner of the South Bronx, a national symbol of blight.
   One of the homeless was Susan Thomas, placed in a shabby welfare
hotel room in Manhattan a few years ago with her two sons, then 6
months and 2{ years old, after she split from their father and ended
up on the street.
   ``I used to cry 'cause I didn't want to be there,'' she says.
Their hotel room was broken into, and drug dealing and fear were all
around.
   After 18 months, she boarded a city van for Leggett Street, to
look at an apartment in a building that had been restored.
   ``I wasn't expecting anything like this,'' the 24-year-old woman
said, talking to a reporter in her tidy, bright two-bedroom
apartment, her boys playing across a room that's still mostly bare
of furnishings. It was Ms. Thomas' day off; she's a clerk in a
nearby store.
   Her building, whose tiled entrance foyer smelled of cleaning
fluid, had been a ruin not long before.
   Another Bronx site still is _ but not for long. Workers there are
gutting five buildings that occupy a whole block, to create 220
apartments for families like the Thomases.
   Vince Campisi, construction supervisor, outgrowled the demolition
equipment as he described getting started: ``You literally couldn't
get in for the junkies. ... Crack? Vials by the garbage-pailful.''
   Leading a reporter on a tour, Campisi crunched up rubble-strewn
steps to the remains of what? a parlor? Its ceiling was burned
through to the sky. A green upholstered sofa stood upended in a
corner. The windows let in a drizzle. ``No air-conditioning
needed,'' he deadpanned.
   Still, he and others said fixing up buildings that landlords have
abandoned is often cheaper than new construction in places like New
York. The gutting-and-rehab job that Campisi is overseeing is to
cost the city $15 million. How much would comparable new buildings
cost? ``Maybe $50 million,'' he guessed.
   Halfway across the country, in Minnesota, the vacant, publicly
owned houses being readied for the homeless look different.
   In Duluth, a three-bedroom ranch house that had reverted to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development when its owners failed
to make payments on a federally backed loan is being readied for a
family that has been on the streets.
   ``We're offering properties that are in good condition,'' said
Patricia Mack of the HUD office in Minneapolis, which hopes by next
spring to lease 15 houses rent-free to non-profit groups that house
the homeless.
   Such efforts have strong support, according to a survey earlier
this year by the National Housing Institute, a non-profit think tank
based in Orange, N.J. One thousand adults were surveyed by phone.
   Eight in 10 favored rehabilitating old and vacant buildings for
homeless Americans, who number 450,000 to 3 million, estimated by
the government and advocacy groups, respectively. Sixty percent said
they'd willingly pay an extra $120 apiece in taxes each year to
expand housing efforts.
   ``The need for permanent housing cannot be met,'' says a
September report by the National Coalition for the Homeless, without
an increase in the federal budget for low-income housing _ $7.538
billion this year, down 77 percent from 1981's budget of $32.2
billion.

   Beyond dollar allocations, however, an ``enormous pool of unused
(federal) property,'' in the words of U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch in Washington, is not even being considered for use by the
homeless, despite a year-old law requiring that surplus government
property be made available for them.
   Gasch made that observation in issuing a preliminary injunction
two months ago, stopping HUD, the Veterans Administration and three
other agencies from disposing of federal property that is eligible
for use under the 1987 Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.
   To Maria Foscarinis, a lawyer representing the National Coalition
in the suit, ``it seemed very peculiar'' that agencies all over the
United States, when pressed to list unused or underused property,
found only 12 parcels and to date have turned over only four to
groups aiding the homeless.
   ``There are literally tens of thousands of pieces of property
across the country. We can't be watchdogs on every one. That's why
we need an aggressive order,'' she said, referring to hopes of a
permanent injunction at a hearing before Gasch on Dec. 5.
   ``The winter is hard upon us,'' the judge said, noting the
urgency of the case in a Nov. 18 hearing on a request for an
updated, complete list of underused property. ``What the court is
fundamentally interested in ... is to make some housing available
for these people.''
   He added, ``I know bureaucrats. ... The thing you've got to do
with bureaucrats is crack the whip and see to it that they do the
job.''
   Not included under the McKinney Act's broad mandate are thousands
of houses the federal government owns through default on mortgages
that it guarantees.
   Nevertheless, advocates sought in a separate lawsuit to stop the
sales of those houses until they could be considered for use for the
homeless. They were turned down by Gasch, and an appeal is pending.
   In fiscal 1988, HUD sold 80,164 of these foreclosed homes at an
average price of $38,000.
   Currently, HUD holds more than 45,000 properties, according to
department spokesman Rod Hiduskey, who noted that the sales revenue
goes mainly into a fund that repays lender banks that HUD has
guaranteed against loss.
   HUD officials argue that the fund would be bankrupted by 1990 if
sales were stopped.
   There are federal programs that discount house prices for
homeless-help agencies, like Ms. Mack's in Minnesota and the
agency's Urban Homesteading Program. Hiduskey said 200 federally
owned homes have been sold at 10 percent below market value under
another program for the homeless.
   Advocates say it's not enough.
   ``Homes have been disposed of with agency coffers in mind, and
not national housing goals,'' asserted the report from the National
Coalition for the Homeless. ``By and large, programs to divert parts
of the inventory to aid the homeless are unpromoted and unused.''
   As a result, some advocates have grown more militant.
   Michael Marubio of the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless said
that group is secretly rehabilitating an abandoned HUD apartment and
will turn it over to a homeless family.
   ``Later on, we'll have a housewarming party and we'll ask HUD
officials and anyone else who wants to come,'' he said.
   Nor is the federal government the only public landlord of vacant
housing.
   According to checks by The Associated Press, as many as 60,000
vacant or near-vacant dwellings may be in local government hands
because of tax delinquency.
   Besides New York City's roughly 5,000 empty and 4,000 partly
occupied buildings, there are 6,500 in Philadelphia, 3,000 in
Detroit, 1,600 in Washington, D.C., and smaller numbers in Boston,
Denver, Miami and other cities, say housing officials.
   In Chicago's Cook County, 41,000 residential properties have been
declared tax delinquent for more than five years, according to
Barbara Grau of the Chicago Rehab Network, a coalition of non-profit
developers.
   ``If America put its mind to it,'' said Marubio, ``we could house
the homeless.''
   In the last three years, the Boston Public Facilities Department
has turned 12 abandoned buildings, out of 100, into shelters for the
homeless.
   The purchase of 50 houses from the Veterans Administration is
part of a $3.1 million Philadelphia plan to provide 490 units of
permanent housing for the homeless.
   In New York City, ``by 1993, every vacant, city-owned building
that can be rebuilt will be renovated already or in a program to
rebuild,'' said Catie Marshall of the city Department of Housing
Preservation and Development.
   In 1986, Mayor Edward Koch announced a 10-year housing plan,
costing more than $5 billion. But that plan, meant to produce
housing for many income groups, should be redrawn to direct more of
the money toward the homeless, says Andrew Scherer, a lawyer
representing an advocacy group, Housing Justice Campaign, in a suit
against Koch.
   Even so, the plan's provision for rehabilitating old buildings
instead of constructing new ones ``economically ... makes sense,''
Scherer said.
   If those squeezed out of homes because of high prices and other
factors are to be saved from the streets, he said, ``The vacant,
abandoned stock that the city has taken title to is the key.''

   The boarded-up house seems out of place among
the neat terraces and well-tended sidewalks where children walk
unescorted from school.
   The middle-class Oxford Circle neighborhood of brick and stone
rowhouses is a good place to live, neighbors boast. No argument,
says Dignity Housing Inc., a non-profit corporation that wants to
repair the empty house and permit a homeless family to enjoy the
neighborhood's calm and stability.
   But the neighbors don't want the homeless problem on their
doorstep. They say the area real-estate market is strong and the
house could sell easily to someone who would have a personal stake
in keeping it up.
   ``The poor people, they come and trash up the neighborhood,''
said John Shepherd, a retiree who lives a few doors away. ``It
doesn't matter if they're black or white.''
   It's still uncertain who will prevail.
   The house, which was occupied until May 1986, when a family that
had defaulted on its mortgage left, was included in the Dignity
Housing program by mistake. When City Council approved the purchase
of 36 houses from the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development, the resolution stated this house was in the West Oak
Lane section, several miles to the northwest.
   City Councilman Jack Kelly, who represents the Oxford Circle
section, insists the house should be privately sold. In June, he won
City Council approval of a resolution ordering the house removed
from the program.
   ``That's why they have erasers on pencils,'' he said.
   But Dignity Housing officials contend the deal is final.
   ``I say `hurray' that this mistake was made, because we need to
put a family in there,'' said Chris Sprowal, the group's executive
director and president of the Philadelphia-based National Union of
the Homeless.
   Dignity Housing has placed 28 homeless families, far fewer than
it had planned, but expects to fill 50 houses by the end of the
year, Sprowal said. City agencies are helping.
   Kelly said city efforts should encourage more private developers
to provide housing for the homeless in areas where neighbors want
them, especially in dilapidated blocks.
   ``I have no problem with that,'' he said. ``I have real big
problems when they start coming into stable neighborhoods.''
   Edward A. Schwartz, director of the city Office of Housing and
Community Development, said he understands the concern and feels
proper screening is needed to ensure the homeless people can assume
responsibility and that the neighborhoods won't turn against them.
   ``But are we to say that we are now going to return to
poorhouses?'' Schwartz said.
   ``The idea is to try to rebuild neighborhoods,'' said Bill Burke,
who founded the non-profit Modular Development Corp. in 1984 with
the idea of making pre-fabricated houses for use by the poor. He
sees Philadelphia's city-owned vacant lots _ Schwartz counts 7,210
of them _ as ripe for building.
   In addition, Schwartz said, Philadelphia owns 6,576 vacant
residential units, of which 5,283 are in single-family dwellings,
mostly rowhouses.
   Philadelphia has enough housing for its 1.6 million people,
according to a June report by Cushing N. Dolbeare, a
Washington-based consultant on housing and public policy. But the
city needs at least $447 million to stem the cycle of deterioration
and abandonment, she said.
   City records show the costs of rehabilitating one group of nine
properties for Dignity Housing averaged $28,300 per unit. But fixing
up houses in the city's more abandoned neighborhoods could cost
$80,000 or more per unit, much more than the city usually can afford
to spend per family, Schwartz said.
   ``A great many units will have to be knocked down,'' Schwartz
said. ``We're knocking down vacant houses at the rate of 1,000 a
year.''
   Demolition has other drawbacks. Many of the houses reflect a lost
elegance and prosperity and are considered part of the city's
architectural heritage.
   Whenever houses must be destroyed, Schwartz said, ``It's going to
be a very wrenching decision.''

   In ``hush-hush'' surroundings,
Kennedy Space Center workers are readying the shuttle Atlantis for
launch on Thursday with five astronauts and a Defense Department
satellite set to spy on the Soviet Union.
   The secrecy contrasts markedly with the Discovery flight earlier
this fall, which was heavily publicized by NASA every step of the
way as the nation's return to space following the Challenger
disaster.
   Hundreds of thousands of spectators watched Discovery take off
and land, but Atlantis will be off-limits to the public. Personnel
working on Atlantis are cautioned not to talk about mission details
with wives, husbands, friends, unauthorized persons or, especially,
reporters.
   Only those with special clearance are allowed to work around the
payload, which was transported to the launch pad in darkness and
loaded in the shuttle's cargo bay two weeks ago.
   When the countdown starts, the launch team will be in a control
center secured against unauthorized entry or electronic
eavesdropping on computers and radio transmissions.
   The Pentagon would like to keep the launch and entire flight a
deep secret. But, realizing it can't do that with a program as
visible as the shuttle, it has agreed to release some information.
   It has allowed NASA, for instance, to report the countdown will
start Monday and that launch of the second post-Challenger shuttle
flight will occur Thursday between 6:32 a.m. and 9:32 a.m. EST. The
precise time will be disclosed just nine minutes before liftoff.
   Sources report the launch is set for about 7 a.m.
   Once Atlantis is safely in orbit, there will be a brief statement
reporting everything is fine. Then there will be a news blackout
until NASA gives notice that the shuttle will land in 24 hours at
Edwards Air Force Base in California. The mission is expected to
last three or four days.
   The silence will be broken only if the astronauts experience a
serious spacecraft problem.
   The flight will be directed from another secure control center at
NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, with certain military
aspects controlled from an Air Force facility in Sunnyvale, Calif.
Communications between spacecraft and ground will be encrypted.
   This will be the 27th shuttle flight and the third dedicated
solely to military purposes. Both the earlier military flights were
flown in 1985. The Defense Department claims the secrecy makes it
more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships sitting off Cape
Canaveral to monitor the flight and learn its purpose.
   Critics contend such secrecy is unnecessary because the Soviets,
with their intelligence capabilities, undoubtedly already know a
great deal about the upcoming mission. And once Atlantis' satellite
is in its own orbit, they say the Russians will be able to track it
precisely and know exactly what it is doing.
   Indeed, much already has leaked out and been published about the
satellite. Sources report it is to circle the globe in an orbit that
will fly over 80 percent of the Soviet Union. There it will gather
detailed radar images and other intelligence data, much of it aimed
at helping U.S. intelligence officials verify Soviet compliance with
arms control treaties.
   The sources say the satellite has an antenna that will spread out
150 feet and that it cost about $500 million, making it one of the
most expensive satellites ever built.
   The sources also report the five crew members will conduct
several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military
observer in space, with reconnaissance a high priority. It is
believed the astronauts will test a special optical device that
resembles hand-held binoculars.
   The Air Force has been planning several experiments for upcoming
shuttle flights to determine how useful astronauts can be for
strategic reconnaissance, surveillance of Soviet naval forces and
other operational military objectives.
   The tests will be coordinated with ground exercises, including
troop maneuvers, naval movements and ballistic missile launches. The
military is not disclosing which of the exercises will be conducted
on the upcoming flight.
   All five crew members are military officers. Navy Cmdr. Robert L.
Gibson is the commander, Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner is the
pilot and the mission specialists are Air Force Col. Richard M.
Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr. William M.
Shepherd.
   Gibson, Mullane and Ross flew on earlier shuttle missions.
   During deployment of the satellite, believed set for the second
day, Mullane reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm which
is to lift the cargo out of the payload bay. Shepherd and Ross
reportedly will be suited up in the shuttle airlock, prepared to
make a spacewalk if there is a problem with the deployment.
   Gibson and Gardner also will be busy checking out more than 200
modifications made to the orbiter to improve safety and reliability
as a result of the Challenger explosion that killed the crew of
seven on Jan. 28, 1986.
   These changes also were made to Discovery, which was launched
Sept. 29, ending a 32-month interruption in the program that
followed Challenger.
   NASA and the astronauts who piloted Discovery reported that,
except for a few minor problems, the ship flew flawlessly.

   Two of the five military men who
will conduct space shuttle Atlantis' secret mission are rookie
astronauts _ a sign of NASA's renewed confidence after Discovery's
triumphant flight earlier this fall.
   And because the flight is entirely classified, the astronauts
will see virtually none of the fanfare that greeted the first
post-Challenger crew. Few details about the mission are being made
public, the astronauts are restricted from talking about their
plans, and even the exact launch time will not be released until
nine minutes prior to liftoff on Dec. 1.
   Recently, the Atlantis astronauts showed up for interviews with
several reporters at the Johnson Space Center wearing ``Lone
Ranger'' style masks as a tongue-in-cheek way of highlighting the
secrecy.
   Astronauts on classified missions generally are off-limits to the
media altogether, but the military agreed to let the Atlantis crew
talk to a few reporters because there was so much interest
surrounding the flight.
   The astronauts said the black masks came in a ``press kit'' that
included flash cards with joke answers that read: ``Yes. No. I don't
know. I can't tell you. I can tell you, but I'd have to kill you.''
   The mixture of veteran and rookie astronauts on the Atlantis crew
returns NASA to the policy it generally followed before the
Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986. For Discovery, with the future
of the nation's space effort hanging in the balance, NASA chose to
go with five experienced astronauts.
   The Atlantis commander is Robert L. ``Hoot'' Gibson, who piloted
a flight in 1984 and headed the crew of the last mission to fly
before Challenger.
   Gibson, who is married to an astronaut, Dr. Rhea Seddon, said he
doesn't expect any major problems flying the orbiter, which has
undergone many changes since the Challenger tragedy.
   ``Discovery did an awful lot of trailblazing and the pathfinding
for all these new modifications we've got to do, and so they went
through all of those and we've had a relatively easy time modifying
Atlantis,'' the 42-year-old Gibson said.
   Still, Gibson is too experienced to expect perfection.
   ``There's always going to be little annoyances, litle glitches
that you're going to encounter,'' he said.
   The other crew members include rookies Guy S. Gardner, an Air
Force lieutenant colonel who has waited seven years to fly in space,
and William M. Shepherd, a Navy commander. Gardner, 40, is the pilot
and Shepherd, 39, is one of three mission specialists.
   Rounding out the crew are Air Force Col. Richard ``Mike''
Mullane, 43, and Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross, 40, who each have
made one shuttle flight.
   Mullane was a mission specialist on the maiden flight of
Discovery in 1984, and Ross twice walked in space during his 1985
flight on Atlantis while demonstrating construction techniques for a
space station.
   Shepherd, who was selected as an astronaut in May 1984, said that
after years of hearing other people talk about spaceflight, he'll be
glad to experience it himself.
   ``I get the impression that it's something that's real hard to
describe, it's pretty enjoyable, pretty awesome and you just have to
see it for yourself before you really understand it,'' he said.
``Most of the contact that I've had with members of the crew and
(astronauts) in our office say things like that.''
   Shepherd, who is single, said his mother and his sister and her
family are planning to be at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to watch his
first launch.
   Gibson, who has a 12-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, said
his family has gotten more comfortable with his job, but still gets
anxious. His mother, who is a pilot, was so nervous at his first
launch that she looked the other way during liftoff.
   ``Even though she was an aviator all those years, it still
bothered her enough that she didn't want to watch. I think after a
couple of minutes, as we got higher off the ground, I think she
started to watch then,'' he said.
   His son, Paul, thinks ``everybody's parents'' fly on shuttles.
   ``He's not old enough to realize that not everybody's folks do
this. So he thinks when he's big, he'll fly space shuttles and he'll
take us to watch his space shuttles go.''
   All shuttle crew members are allowed to take personal mementos
and cassettes of music into space. Shepherd said he is taking
several items on his first flight, but he doesn't want to say what
they are because it's a surprise for his family.
   Astronauts often take such things as pictures, jewelry,
medallions and flags aboard for their relatives, former schools and
favorite organizations.
   Mullane, who was born in Wichita Falls, Texas, but considers
Albuquerque, N.M., his hometown, is taking along a dinosaur tooth.
   The tooth, part of the collection at the New Mexico Museum of
Natural History in Albuquerque, is from a meat-eating dinosaur
common to the New Mexico area about 68 million years ago, said John
Arnold, museum spokesman.
   Arnold said Mullane is a fan of the museum and had asked
officials there if they wanted him to take an artifact into space.
They happily provided the tooth, which will be returned after its
trip.
   Gardner, a native of Alexandria, Va., will carry a key to the
city and an athletic letter from George Washington High School.
   Ross was born in Crown Point, Ind., where his parents still live.
Shepherd was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and grew up in the
Washington, D.C. area, where his mother still lives.
   Gibson is taking along a baseball from the Baseball Hall of Fame
in Cooperstown, N.Y., where he was born. Once in space, all the
astronauts will sign the ball and it later will be returned to the
hall, he said.
   ``We've got a bunch of guys in the office who are real baseball
fans and they are just sick that I'm going to have my name in the
Baseball Hall of Fame,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Shares Hit Record High Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against the Japanese yen
following its overnight decline overseas, while share prices rose
moderately to another record high on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 121.87 yen, down 0.74 yen from Monday's
finish at 122.52 yen. The currency opened at 121.85 yen and ended
slightly lower despite the Bank of Japan's reported intervention.
   Market sources said the central bank began buying dollars when
the currency fell to around 121.60 yen Tuesday morning and made
intermittent purchases in the afternoon.
   The dollar's bearishness in Tokyo followed its overnight decline
on overseas markets, said Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``The dollar started lower this morning and stayed that way,''
she said, adding: ``There was no new factor in Tokyo to lower the
dollar otherwise.''
   However, dealers were inclined to sell dollars ahead of the Labor
Thanksgiving Day holiday Wednesday, when currency and stock markets
will be closed, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo. He said many
others were sitting on the sidelines because of the bank's
intervention.
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today that Japan is willing
to take measures to save the dollar from declining further, but
indicated he was not overly concerned about its fall to the
121.00-yen level.
   He said the dollar's slide after the U.S. presidential election
Nov. 8 has been based on speculation and has ignored basic economic
fundamentals between the United States and Japan.
   Meanwhile, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 145.86
points, or 0.50 percent, to finish at a record high of 29,430.12.
The index has gained for eight consecutive days since Nov. 11.
   The index moved little during the morning session, mainly because
of profit-taking and directionless trading, said a dealer at a major
securities firm. Investors began buying speculatively in the
afternoon, and the index rose, he said, speaking anonymously.
   In active trading with volume on the first section estimated at
1.2 billion shares, steels and shipbuilding attracted attention.

   The dollar drifted lower in early European trading
today.
   Gold prices fell slightly.
   Foreign currency dealers in London said the dollar will likely
remain under pressure in the near-term, but they expect trading to
be quiet all week because of a Japanese holiday on Wednesday and the
American Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.
   Dealers said the market is keeping an eye on the central banks.
One trader noted the dollar is currently trading around the same
levels as it was last Thursday when central banks joined together to
defend the U.S. currency.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.74 yen to a closing 121.78, despite reported
intervention by the Bank of Japan. Later, in London, it was quoted
at 121.60 yen.
   Traders in Tokyo said the Japanese central bank began buying
dollars when the currency fell to around 121.60 yen this morning and
made occasional purchases in the afternoon.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7285 West German marks, down from 1.7305; 1.4545
Swiss francs, down from 1.4575; 5.9075 French francs, down from
5.9305; 1.9475 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9550; 1,284.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,288.62; and 1.1975 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2117.
   Traders said the Canadian dollar's rise was due to Monday's
electoral victory by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's governing
Conservative Party.
   The win means the free trade agreement with the United States
will go ahead, and that's good news for the Canadian currency,
dealers say.
   ``Everyone is happy,'' said a trader at a U.S. bank.
   The British pound cost $1.8260 in London, almost 1 cent more
expensive for buyers than late Monday's $1.8175.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $415.70 a troy ounce,
down from $416.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $416.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $416.00, down from $416.50 bid late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to close at a bid
$418.04.
   Silver was quoted in London today at a bid price of $6.05 a troy
ounce, up marginally from Monday's $6.04.

<TEXT>
   Here are highlights of the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE TRADING PARTNERS _ The two nations already are each other's
largest trading partner. The annual exchange of $150 billion makes
it the largest two-nation trading partnership in the world.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE AGREEMENT _ President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney signed the agreement Jan. 2. The U.S. Congress approved the
agreement but it still needs Canadian parliamentary approval. The
agreement would take effect Jan. 1, 1989, and eliminate any
remaining tariffs between the countries over a 10-year period,
dismantle many investment barriers, free up trade in energy and
services, and create Canadian-U.S. panels to settle disputes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOCIAL PROGRAMS _ Opponents charge that Canadian social programs
such as medicare, unemployment insurance and pensions will be
affected by the need to compete on an equal footing. Supporters
maintain social programs are unaffected by the agreement and
protected by international tradelaw.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CULTURE _ Critics say Canadian industries such as publishing,
broadcasting and cinema could be overwhelmed by American programs.
Supporters argue that cultural policies are exempt from the
agreement and remain protected.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EMPLOYMENT _ Opponents charge that Canada would pay too high a
price under the agreement for a relatively small number of
lower-paying jobs in the service sector that would be created by
increased trade. They say farmers and food processors and the
textile and appliance industries would be among the hardest hit by
U.S. competition. Supporters forecast as many as 250,000 new jobs in
Canada during the first 10 years of the agreement.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES _ The United States would gain
non-discriminatory access to Canadian energy supplies. Opponents
argue this could lead to Canada losing control of its vast energy,
water and other natural resources and being reduced to a source of
raw materials for the U.S. market. Supporters maintain the agreement
means Canadian energy exports will no longer face the future threat
of U.S. trade sanctions that could limit sales and that Canada still
would control its resources in the event of shortages.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE FUTURE _ Opponents paint a grim picture of Canada losing
control of its economic future and say political sovereignty could
suffer as a result of the agreement. They say Canada already is too
dependent on the United States as a customer and should develop
markets in other countries instead. Supporters say access to the
larger U.S. market must be guaranteed to ensure future Canadian
prosperity. They argue that without the agreement Canada risks
becoming an isolated international backwater, the smallest
industrial nation without participation in a larger trading bloc.

<HEAD>Mexican President Hopes For Quick Talks On Debt</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.
^By RICHARD HERZFELDER</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico hopes to begin cabinet-level meetings
on ways of relieving Mexico's foreign debt even before George Bush
takes office, sources close to President-elect Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's transition team say.
   Mexico's $102 billion debt is an urgent priority for Salinas, who
was to meet with the U.S. president-elect this afternoon in Houston.
   As Salinas sees it, Mexico must resume economic growth and debt
payments leave little money for development.
   Salinas believes discussions could begin soon after his six-year
term begins Dec. 1 because Bush has already said he will retain
current U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in office, the
sources said Monday night.
   Bush does not take office until Jan. 20.
   Salinas has never met Bush and hopes their two-hour luncheon
meeting today will establish a personal bond and set a tone for
U.S.-Mexico relations for at least the next four years.
   ``Both Bush and Salinas are men with open minds who are willing
to listen to the interests and concerns of others. We have different
problems and common interests,'' said Juan Enriquez, a top official
of Mexico's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Salinas also wishes to begin discussions on commercial relations.
He fears protectionist sentiment in the United States would hurt
Mexico's effort to improve its economy via non-petroleum exports,
said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Salinas also is concerned about Mexican migration, a result of a
lack of jobs and development in his homeland. He believes the
``tremendous current'' should be discussed and recognized openly so
it can be both orderly and controlled, the sources said.
   Some Mexicans fear the United States may see drug trafficking as
the main bilateral problem. Outgoing President Miguel de la Madrid's
six meetings with President Reagan were marked by U.S. demands,
often irritating to Mexico, that it do more to fight drug
trafficking.
   At their final meeting in February, de la Madrid said bluntly
that the best way to fight the drugs was for citizens of the United
States to stop using them, but the U.S. believes Mexico could do
more.
   Salinas plans to fight drug trafficking more energetically and is
also concerned about the ``cash crop'' problem _ in some areas,
Mexican campesinos can increase their income 10 or 20 times by
growing marijuana.
   The two governments have managed to work out temporary or partial
solutions to many other problems, including water contamination
along the border.
   The Bush-Salinas meeting ``represents a first positive step in
identifying the issues that will occupy the agenda'' during their
presidencies, said a statement released Monday night by Salinas'
office.
   The meeting's agenda was to be flexible, the statement said, with
its main goal to establish a personal basis for ``a fruitful and
consistent relationship.''
   Mexican foreign policy is often at odds with that of the United
States, especially in Central America, and Mexicans feel U.S.
government officials do not understand their culture and politics
well enough.
   But Salinas aides privately speak of a Bush who ``likes Mexico
and knows the country and its culture and its problems.'' Bush has
lived in the border state of Texas for many years, and his son is
married to a Mexican.

<HEAD>Poll: Love Affairs, Divorce, Changing Jobs Top Wishes Of Japanese
Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese male office workers dream most of having
love affairs with their female colleagues, getting divorced or
changing their jobs, says a recent survey by a local insurance
company.
   The poll of 500 men aged 20 to 60 by the Tokyo-based Fukoku
Mutual Life Insurance Co. also found that only 12.8 percent of
Japan's diligent workers say they are required by their employers to
focus solely on work matters while in the office.
   A full 58.4 percent said they are allowed to read newspapers and
50.8 percent said they can leave the office on personal business
during working hours.
   Asked what they dreamed of doing but knew they could not, 37
percent of the men surveyed in the Tokyo poll said they would like
to have love affairs with younger female colleagues in their office
and 34.2 percent said they dreamed of divorcing their wives.
   Changing jobs was another popular fantasy, cited by 36.2 percent
of those surveyed.
   Workers aged 20 to 39 favored love affairs, while those in their
40s dreamed most of changing jobs and those in their 50s preferred
divorce, the survey said.
   Although Japanese on average work over 200 hours a year more than
Americans, time counted as working time isn't always what it seems.
   Some 36.6 percent of the men surveyed said they could relax in
coffee shops during office hours, and 16 percent said they could go
shopping.
   The insurance company conducted the survey to gauge the impact of
workers' business life on their family life and free time, said
company spokeswoman Miki Tanaka.

<TEXT>
   Hospital Corporation of America's
decision to sell to a senior management-led group will go before
shareholders of the nation's largest health care concern sometime in
February, officials say.
   HCA's board of directors Monday agreed to sell the hospital
management giant for $3.6 billion in cash and securities to TF
Investments Inc., a company formed by HCA management and headed by
HCA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas F. Frist Jr.
   The group's offer includes $43 in cash and $8 in securities for
each of HCA's 71.4 million common shares outstanding.
   HCA stock closed up 62| cents at $46.62| a share Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   HCA stockholders are scheduled to meet sometime in February,
company officials announced in a news release. An exact date was not
given.
   Frist could not be reached immediately for comment.
   A special committee of outside directors had rejected the Frist
group's initial offer of $47 a share and rejected a $51 a share
proposal on Oct. 17. The committee at that time indicated it would
accept bids from other parties through Friday, although a number of
industry analysts expressed skepticism the company would get a
higher offer.
   ``The board's approval was based in part upon the recommendation
of a special committee of the board comprised of nine outside
directors and the opinion of Morgan Stanley that, as of Nov. 21,
1988, the consideration to be paid in the merger is fair to HCA
shareholders from a financial point of view,'' officials said in
Monday's news release.
   HCA spokesman John Van Mol said he did not know whether any other
offers were made by Friday's deadline.
   HCA, which owns or operates nearly 400 hospitals nationwide, set
up the special committee to consider buyout offers after the initial
proposal in mid-September.
   The company sold 104 of its less profitable hospitals just over a
year ago to a new employee-owned company, HealthTrust Inc., in a
spinoff that netted almost $1.6 billion.
   John Hindelong, a health care analyst for Smith Barney Harris &
Upham in New York, said Nov. 14 that anyone who takes over HCA might
consider selling its interest in HealthTrust. But Hindelong said
HealthTrust might be more valuable if held for a year while it pays
off its own debt.
   HCA also could find buyers for other assets and divisions
including HCA's psychiatric company, the management contracts, its
international hospital business ``or even little bits and pieces of
HCA,'' Hindelong said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices were higher, near the day's best
levels, at midday Tuesday, helped by Wall Street's late rally on
Monday.
   But trading activity slowed following a spurt of volume at
midmorning, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 7.3
points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,818.4 at about 12:45 p.m.
   The index opened 2.2 points up, its lowest level for the day, and
peaked shortly before midday at 7.9 points higher.
   Volume was light to moderate, as 278.9 million shares changed
hands by midday, with much of this volume concentrated in selected
stocks. It compared with volume of 173.4 million shares at the same
time Monday.
   Dealers were encouraged by Wall Street's performance, where the
Dow Jones industrial average ended Monday with a gain of 3.56 points
at 2,065.97, after being down about 17 points earlier in the day.
   Meanwhile, prices of Canadian shares traded in London surged
higher at midmorning Tuesday, propelled by the clear-cut win of the
Progressive Conservative Party in Monday's federal elections in
Canada.
   Canadians reelected Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, thereby
approving the controversial free trade agreement with the United
States.
   ``Now that the Conservatives have a majority, the free trade
agreement is academic,'' said Jeff Richmond, institutional equity
salesman at Wood Gundy in London.
   A week ago, Canadian stocks were ``inordinately knocked back on
fears the (free-trade) pact would be scrapped, giving way to
negative sentiment,'' he said.
   Peter Guldberg, a trader at Scotia McLeod Inc. in London, said
there is a sense of relief with the Conservative victory because
``it makes people more confident about the Canadian dollar and the
trade agreement.''

   A decision by General Motors Corp. on
whether it will assemble a new pair of rear-wheel drive cars at its
idled Fiero assembly plant is expected early next year, a union
official says.
   Dick Long, vice president of United Auto Workers union Local 653
said Monday the union is hoping GM will decide to build its newly
designed Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models at the plant.
   Long also said plants in Oklahoma City and Van Nuys, Calif., are
in the running to get the new cars. The California plant assembles
the current versions of the Camaro and Firebird.
   GM spokesman Darwin Allen declined to discuss the new cars other
than to say their design is totally new.
   ``It's not just a face-lift,'' he said.
   GM closed the Fiero plant in August after assembling the
two-seat, plastic-body car there since 1983. Fiero sales slumped
badly in 1987 and this year after getting off to a fast start when
the car was introduced. No other plant builds the Fiero.

   General Motors Corp.'s assembly plants in
Doraville, Ga., and Fairfax, Kan., will be closed for two weeks
each, affecting about 7,600 hourly workers, the automaker says.
   ``We've been faced with problems from certain suppliers that led
us to make a decision to get the situation back into control,'' said
GM spokeswoman Sharon Hines. She refused to identify the suppliers
or elaborate on the problems.
   Hines said Monday the Doraville, Ga., plant will be shut down
this week and next week, and the company's plant in Fairfax, Kan.,
will close the weeks of Nov. 28 and Dec. 5.
   The company makes Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand
Prix cars at the two plants. The closings will reduce production by
13,000 to 14,000 cars.
   ``They have either overestimated the strength of the market or
they overestimated their share of it,'' said auto analyst Ted
Sullivan of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.

<HEAD>Will Pork Rinds Be The New `In' Snack in Washington?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The grocery stores in Owensboro are abuzz
with talk about pork rinds, the favorite snack of President-elect
George Bush.
   ``We did see a slight increase in that department during the
campaign,'' said Ted Belcher, spokesman for one local chain. ``And
I've heard people talking about them in the stores. It's kind of
like jelly beans.''
   Jelly beans, of course, are President Reagan's favorite snack.
   Owensboro grocers, however, say they have seen little change in
pork-rind sales this month.
   Months ago, in the days when Vice President Bush was trying to
establish a more macho image for his presidential campaign, his
staff let it be known that his favorite snack food is pork rinds.
   Pork what? many city dwellers asked.
   Pork rinds, as in fried pig skin. That's right. The fried hide of
a hog.
   Until Bush's campaign, pork rinds were virtually ignored by the
media. But the industry is expected to reach the $200 million sales
mark this year. The Snack Food Association in Alexandria, Va., a
Washington suburb, said final figures for 1988 won't be in until
June 1989.
   In 1987, Americans gobbled $195 million worth of the skins,
compared with $186 million in 1986 and $184 million in 1985.
   ``It's too soon to tell if the Bush publicity is translating into
increased sales,'' said a spokeswoman for the Snack Food
Association. But sales have been climbing steadily without the
publicity.
   John Rudolph, president of Rudolph Foods Co. in Lima, Ohio, said
his company, which specializes in pork rinds and cracklings and
controls 35 percent of the national market for those products, has
received a lot of publicity.
   ``But we're busy as the dickens already. We work 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,'' Rudolph said.
   And Rudolph said he can't tell if all the pork-rind publicity is
translating into sales.
   ``But it can't hurt,'' he said. ``Pork rinds have always been a
working man's product. It's unusual to have them associated with the
president.''

   The publisher of two suburban Detroit daily
newspapers has resigned in an apparent dispute with the
Florida-based owner of the papers.
   Gene Chambers, publisher of The Macomb Daily in Mount Clemens and
The Daily Tribune in Royal Oak, said Monday he reached a mutual
agreement with Adams Communications Corp. to step down from his post.
   ``I don't know who pulled the trigger first,'' he said. ``We just
had differences on too many things. Right now, I'm looking for a new
challenge _ something I can get excited about.''
   Chambers, 48, has been publisher of the 53,000-circulation Macomb
Daily since April 1982. The newspaper was sold to Adams' publishing
division in December 1987.
   When Adams purchased the 39,500-circulation Daily Tribune last
summer, Chambers assumed the publishing duties of that newspaper as
well.

   Stock prices were mixed today in trading marked
by some buying of blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.55 to 2,069.52 in
the first half hour of trading.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 316 up, 559
down and 492 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.08 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the trading day began the Labor Department reported that
the consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in October. The figure
came in a bit above advance estimates on Wall Street.
   But analysts said traders were still showing interest in big-name
stocks, apparently believing those issues were due for a rebound
after the market's broad decline earlier this month.
   Brokers said there also might be some buying by people hoping for
quick trading profits.
   Considerable attention has been devoted to the market's
historical tendency to post at least a small gain over the two
sessions before and after Thanksgiving.
   Whether this is simply coincidence or not, Newton Zinder at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. noted that stocks have had a net gain
over those two sessions in 33 of the past 36 years.
   Hospital Corp. of America fell 3[ to 43{. The company agreed to a
management buyout proposal after apparently failing to attract other
bidders.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .04 to 150.14. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .84 at 288.01.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a 3.56
gain at 2,065.97.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 552 up, 920 down and 482 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 120.43 million shares, against 119.32
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the European
Economic Community moved closer to a tit-for-tat trade war Tuesday
over EEC plans to ban imports of meat treated with growth-boosting
hormones as of Jan. 1.
   At a meeting here, U.S. officials rejected EEC compromise
proposals to reduce the ban's effect while EEC foreign ministers
stuck by the ban for health reasons.
   The proposed ban affects $145 million of U.S. meat exports a year
to the EEC, according to U.S. figures.
   The United States has drafted a list of EEC imports of roughly
the same value which are to be taxed in retaliation for the ban.
U.S. officials also have threatened to halt imports of EEC meat said
to contain hormones, which they say indicates the EEC ban is being
violated in the 12-nation Community itself.
   The EEC is asking the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to
rule the planned retaliatory measures illegal. The EEC foreign
ministers said in a statement that the retaliation Washington
considers would be ``a violation of the GATT rules'' on free trade.
   In talks last week with U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter, the EEC offered to exempt from its ban meat used for pet
food coupled with a rise in imports of top-quality U.S. beef.
   Alfred Kingon, the U.S. envoy to the EEC, said the United States
accepted the offer on pet food but ``was not willing to move on
high-quality beef'' which would still have to be free of hormones.
   The foreign ministers asked the EEC Commission to continue to try
and reach a solution. But Willy De Clercq, the EEC's External
Relations Commissioner, told reporters, ``I am not very optimistic.''
   De Clercq opposes delaying implementation of the ban which, he
said, is not discriminatory as it applies to all meat imports.
   One source quoted him as telling the ministers, ``The United
States has blocked any progress though we tried to get a
compromise.''
   Britain, the Netherlands, West Germany and Denmark urged the EEC
Commission to ``do its utmost to prevent a trade war,'' said the
source.
   The two sides will meet twice before the Dec. 5 start of a
gathering of officials from the 96 GATT nations in Montreal next
month, officials said.
   A British proposal to delay the hormone ban for six months to
enable the new U.S. administration to deal with the issue was
rejected.
   The EEC first decided to ban hormones in meat at the beginning of
1988. The ban's implementation was delayed in the hope a compromise
solution could be found with the United States.
   The EEC adopted its blanket ban on hormones in meat for health
reasons. The United States bans the use of some, not all, hormones,
and says this poses no health hazard to consumers.

   Stock prices were little changed today in trading
marked by some buying of blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.49 to 2,068.46 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 509 up, 626
down and 543 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 36.76 million shares at
midmorning.
   Before the trading day began the Labor Department reported that
the consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in October. The figure
came in a bit above advance estimates on Wall Street.
   But analysts said traders were still showing interest in big-name
stocks, apparently believing those issues were due for a rebound
after the market's broad decline earlier this month.
   Brokers said there also might be some buying by people hoping for
quick trading profits.
   Considerable attention has been devoted to the market's
historical tendency to post at least a small gain over the two
sessions before and after Thanksgiving.
   Whether this is simply coincidence or not, Newton Zinder at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. noted that stocks have had a net gain
over those two sessions in 33 of the past 36 years.
   Hospital Corp. of America fell 3[ to 43{. The company agreed to a
management buyout proposal after apparently failing to attract other
bidders.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .06 to 150.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .97 at 288.14.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures opened higher today on
the Chicago Board of Trade while wheat futures were mixed.
   The higher soybean and corn prices also prompted some selling by
speculators, which tended to limit the early gains, analysts said.
   The wheat market continued to struggle amid disappointment over
the lack of a new long-term grain sales agreement with the Soviet
Union to replace the one that expired on Sept. 30.
   ``The LTA (long-term agreement) is still an intangible _ we just
can't feel that situation yet and that's starting to be felt in the
market,'' said Pat O'Connell, grain market analyst with Refco Inc.,
a large, Chicago-based commodities brokerage house.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to \ cent higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.08 a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1 cent higher with December at $2.62 a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 3 cents higher with December at $2.09 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1} cents to 2 cents higher with January at $7.48 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .13 cent to .40 cent higher with December at
72.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent higher
with January at 81.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .80 cent lower
to .23 cent higher with December at 40.05 cents a pound; and frozen
pork bellies were unchanged to .20 cent higher with February at
42.60 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Monday.

   Iran's oil minister suggested today that a
breakthrough was possible in OPEC's effort to reach an oil
production agreement, and crude oil prices soared more than a $1 a
barrel on the news.
   ``I think we can reach an agreement,'' Gholamreza Aghazadeh said
between private talks with other OPEC ministers.
   Aghazadeh's comment was in stark contrast to Iran's earlier open
refusal to allow rival Iraq oil quota parity, which has been one of
the chief stumbling blocks to an accord among all cartel members.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, stood at
$13.99 a barrel shortly after 11 a.m. EST, up $1.01 from Monday's
close.
   Venezuelan, Indonesian, Nigerian and Algerian ministers were
meeting separately with representatives from the formerly warring
gulf states to try to reach agreement before Wednesday.
   Iran had previously threatened to increase its oil production if
there is no agreement. The Iranian oil minister told reporters
Monday the country is pumping well above the production quota set by
the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The cartel is trying at its winter meeting, which officially
began Monday, to work out a new accord to restrain a production glut
that has sent prices downward.
   Iraq is insisting it get the same quota as Iran, and refused to
join the quota system now in effect because of this demand. Iran
wants to retain its ranking as the No.2 OPEC producer after Saudi
Arabia.
   The Saudi oil giant, which produces a quarter of the cartel's
oil, says it will not join a new quota system unless all 13 nations
take part.
   ``Everybody has indicated a willingness to be integrated (into a
production pact), but to what extent they will cooperate now is
unclear,'' said a senior delegate, who demanded anonymity.
   A member of a key delegation said Aghazadeh has suggested
ministers rework a proposal recommending OPEC boost its official
output ceiling, which now excludes Iraq, from about 15 million
barrels a day to a minimum of 17.4 million barrels.
   The higher ceiling would make room for Iraq, allotting it the
same share of 2.4 million barrels a day now held by Iran. Iraq's
current cap is 1.5 million barrels a day.
   Aghazadeh, according to the senior delegate, suggested that
rather than giving the same quota to Iraq, the cartel divide the
additional production between Iran and Iraq. Both want more money to
help rebuild their war-damaged economies.
   That would give Iran a quota of about 2.9 million barrels and
Iraq presumably about 2 million.
   That scenario _ apparently rejected by other ministers _ shows
Aghazadeh's unwillingness to give in.
   He told reporters Monday that Iran could boost oil production to
more than 4 million barrels a day within a year.
   He said the country currently is pumping more than 3 million
barrels a day.
   Analysts, however, have estimated Iran's production at 2.3
million to 2.5 million barrels.
   They estimate Iraq is producing at least 2.6 million barrels a
day, an amount that could reach 3.7 million barrels in mid-1989 when
a new pipeline through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea is completed.

   South African companies are expanding abroad as
disinvestment, sanctions and the threat of future turmoil slows
their country's economic growth.
   The United States, Japan, France, and Denmark have imposed
sanctions ranging from trade embargoes to refusing to extend loans,
and many foreign corporations have sold off their South African
interests.
   South African companies looking to expand or move outside the
country may be particularly attracted to Britain, because of Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's steadfast opposition to sanctions.
   But if the case of mining giant Minorco SA is any indication,
South African companies that make publicly disclosed offers are
likely to face growing resistance from the courts and regulators as
well as anti-apartheid campaigners.
   The British government has delayed the firm's $4.7 billion bid
for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC pending a monopoly review. Other
countries have also thrown up roadblocks.
   South African companies are nonetheless intent on protecting
their financial interests. They ``can see day in and day out that
the turmoil of what they describe as the worst kind comes closer and
closer,'' said Brian Bolton, an England-based writer on South
African topics who supports the anti-apartheid movement.
   ``At some stage they have to act,'' Bolton said. ``What that
means at some point is putting up the shutters and hoping they have
put away enough overseas to keep them in the style to which they are
accustomed.''
   South Africa's Rembrandt Group Ltd., a major tobacco and consumer
products company controlled by the wealthy Rupert family, elected in
September to spin off its Richemont Group of non-South African
interests.
   Richemont has listed its shares on Swiss stock exchanges and it
has no operational ties to South Africa, but still is effectively
controlled by the Ruperts.
   The Ruperts say they want to establish a presence in Europe
before 1992, when the European Economic Community becomes a single,
barrier-free trading bloc.
   In a telephone interview, Jan du Plessis, Richemont's finance
director in Zug, Switzerland, also cited South African government
restrictions, which made it difficult to raise funds publicly, as
well as the impracticality of having headquarters far away in South
Africa.
   Other South African companies setting up footholds abroad include:
   _Liberty Life Association of Africa Ltd., an insurance group,
which recently set up First International Trust in Europe.
   _FSI Corporation Ltd., an industrial group that holds AAF
Investment Corp. in London.
   _Malbak Ltd.'s Abercom, which recently bid for MY Holdings PLC, a
British sporting goods and games manufacturer.
   Unlike some smaller deals, Minorco's bid has attracted unusual
attention because it would link two of the world's largest gold
mining groups in what would be the largest ever takeover in Britain.
   Minorco is a Luxembourg-based investment company controlled by
the wealthy South African Oppenheimer family's Anglo American gold
and De Beers diamond mining interests. It describes its hostile bid
for Consolidated Gold Fields as part of a strategy to become a
worldwide natural resources group with direct operating control of
its activities.
   But aside from raising monopoly questions, the bid has sparked a
row over the extension of South African control to gold production
in the United States and the Pacific region.
   Nearly 45 percent of the non-communist world's gold production of
1,361.7 metric tons in 1987 was mined in South Africa, according to
Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities in London.
   Minorco is now 60 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. and De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. Although that would drop to 41 percent
after the takeover, with shareholders owning the remainder, analysts
say even a 41 percent holding assures Anglo American and De Beers
effective control.
   Minorco says that if the bid succeeds, it would sell Consolidated
Gold Fields' South African interests, namely its 38 percent stake in
Gold Fields South Africa, which accounts for 15 percent of the
target's pre-tax profits. Consolidated Gold Fields also controls
49.7 percent of U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp.
   The British government blocked the bid on Oct. 25 for up to three
months by referring it to its Monopolies and Mergers Commission to
investigate its effect on the public interest, particularly on
competition in strategic metals of titanium and zircon.
   In addition, the federal judge in New York issued a preliminary
injunction against the deal on the grounds it would reduce
competition in the world gold market.
   Elsewhere, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, Rabbie Namaliu, has
warned he would require Minorco to divest itself of Consolidated
Gold Fields' Papua New Guinea interests, saying: ``We cannot allow
this apartheid regime to benefit from our rich resources.''
   Consolidated Gold Fields has lobbied the White House to block the
deal for national security reasons, raising concerns about South
African control of the supply of metals.
   ``Minorco is South African-controlled and this would inflict
great damage on our operating companies,'' Rudolph Agnew, chairman
of Consolidated Gold Fields, told the annual shareholders' meeting
in early November.
   Minorco countered in a letter to President Reagan that
Consolidated Gold Fields was engaging in ``lurid rhetoric''
intending ``to smear Minorco with the taint of apartheid and the
repressive policies of the present South African government.''
   With South African interests of its own, Consolidated Gold Fields
has attracted criticism from some of its own shareholders.
   South African industrialist Harry Oppenheimer told the Sunday
Telegraph: ``I find it unbelievable to be attacked on the grounds of
South African connections, particularly by a group which has been
very active in South Africa and which certainly has not been in the
forefront of opposition to apartheid policy.''
   Minorco has indicated a willingness to sell pieces of
Consolidated Gold Fields to satisfy regulatory concerns.
   However, Chris Pearson, an analyst with the London investment
firm Smith New Court Ltd. pointed out that because of objections in
different countries, Minorco might be asked to sell off a number of
pieces of the target.
   ``What are they really going to be left with at the end of the
day?'' Pearson asked.

   Although Asahi Breweries says ``dry'' beer is still
the biggest thing since the hop, the competition believes Japan may
now be ready for the next step in specialty brews _ post-dry.
   Yoshiki Koga, a spokesman for Sapporo Breweries, battling Asahi
for second place in domestic beer sales, said his company is now
marketing ``post-dry'' beers _ aimed at even more discriminating
tastes.
   ``Dry beer has taken a certain share of the market, but I've
heard rumors that as a fad it has reached its limit,'' Koga said.
``And, to give beer drinkers a more diverse market, Sapporo has
introduced Rocks and The Winter's Tale.''
   Rocks, which went on sale in March, has 9 percent alcohol
content, double the usual, and is for those _ as the name suggests _
who want to drink their beer with ice cubes.
   The Winter's Tale, which takes its name from the title of one of
Shakespeare's late plays, went on sale in the Tokyo area in November
and is to be sold only during the winter.
   Koga admitted the new products were influenced by Asahi's success
with dry and said Sapporo was hoping to spark a similar hit.
   The nation's leading brewer, Kirin, on Nov. 16 introduced Half
and Half, a mixture of light and dark beers, in some urban areas.
   ``We didn't plan it as a rival for dry,'' said Keisuke Suzuki, a
Kirin spokesman. ``But the dry phenomenon does seem to be slowing
down and many people are awaiting something new.''
   Kirin, which sells half of all the beer in Japan, began marketing
its own dry brew earlier this year and now has 30 percent of that
market, Suzuki said.
   He said that in 1987, 1.4 billion gallons of beer were consumed
here, making Japan the world's fourth-largest market after the
United States, West Germany and England.
   ``Brewers hadn't tried to change the taste of beer much until we
came up with the idea of producing something with a crisper taste,''
Asahi spokesman Ryuji Amada said.
   The dry brew is higher in alcohol content and has less sugar than
regular beer _ a prescription that, according to Amada, was just
what consumers were after.
   ``There has never been anything like dry,'' gloated Amada, whose
company controls about half the growing market for dry beer.
   ``Since we first introduced dry beer in March last year, our
overall sales have gone from 10 to 20 percent of the total beer
market.''
   The Kirin, Sapporo and Suntory breweries followed Asahi with
their own versions of dry, but remain far behind Asahi.
   Amada said sales of ``dry'' now make up about one-third of all
beer sales in Japan, ``and we think that could go as high as 50
percent next year.''
   Dry has even begun penetrating the U.S. market, he said, and
along with Japanese imports in Hawaii, California and New York,
Anheuser-Busch is brewing Michelob Dry for nationwide distribution.
   Dry beer was so successful that ``dry'' burgers _ they are
spicier, not less moist _ assaulted the Japanese diet.
   But the dry fad ``seems to have peaked last summer,'' according
to a spokesman for First Kitchen, a nationwide fast-food chain that
put ``dry'' hamburgers on its menu in June with Mexican spices
setting them apart from other burgers.
   ``The dry hamburgers were popular, but we've decided to
discontinue sales by the end of November,'' he said, requesting
anonymity.
   Even so, Asahi is not about to give up on a good thing and scoffs
at the challengers' products.
   ``It won't be easy to beat dry,'' said Amada. ``The products
going on the market aren't really new, and it was specialty beers
that dry ate up to begin with.''
   He said, ``We don't think dry is the best possible beer, but we
do think it still has a long way to go in the market and aren't
contemplating a followup product just yet.''

<HEAD>Ski Industry Facing Big Challenges, Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Skiers will skitter down snowy slopes across the
land this holiday weekend as many resorts open their seasons, but
industry executives say they are facing anxious times.
   An aging baby boom population and increasing labor and insurance
costs are squeezing the resorts, and operators are reaching out to
new markets like families to try to stabilize the business.
   Since the late 1960s and 1970s, the number of ski areas has
declined from 1,400 to about 600, said Jerry Jones, executive vice
president of the Vail, Colo., ski operation, which this year became
the largest ski resort in the country.
   The number skiers grew at double-digit rates during the 1970s,
but the rate has slowed sharply since then.
   In the past five years in just Colorado, a half dozen resorts
have gone out of business, and up to half of the 28 ski areas
remaining are thought to be struggling financially.
   The smaller resorts, especially, ``have some problems, big
problems,'' Jones said.
   The National Ski Area Association has launched a major study it
hopes will foster a national campaign to attract skiers, similar to
generic ads that promote the coffee industry or dairy products.
   Kathe Dillmann at the association said the business is just
maturing after two decades of rapid growth, and said no one expected
the industry to keep up its double-digit growth rate.
   ``This is a business,'' she said. ``This cycle is not the boom
cycle now, but that doesn't mean it's not healthy. All businesses go
through that. We have to look for our niche and see what the market
is going to do.''
   One of the biggest problems facing the industry is attracting new
skiers.
   ``In the 1960s and 1970s the baby boomers grew with the
industry,'' Jones said. ``Then the women started dropping out when
they reached their 30s, and the men started dropping out when they
reached their 40s. You just can't invent 17-year-old kids.''
   As a result, ski areas have changed their emphasis to be more
family-oriented. They provide child care, ski programs for
youngsters and other winter-related activities such as sleigh rides
and ice skating, in addition to restaurants and other amenities for
the non-skier.
   Jones says there also is a trend toward specialized ski resorts
resembling theme parks.
   ``You can already see this happening,'' he said, offering several
examples from his home state. ``Steamboat Springs is a Western ski
resort, Vail is a Bavarian theme resort, Aspen is a Victorian theme
resort. I think you'll see more specialization, such as a resort for
the elderly, or for beginners only.''
   A religious ski resort even has been tried, offering an
alcohol-free environment and church services after skiing. However,
the resort says it may close because of financial problems.
   Stephanie Nora of Colorado Ski Country USA, which represents the
28 resorts in Colorado, said many resorts are offering innovative
pricing to lure skiers, selling advance tickets through grocery
stores and convenience stories, multi-day packages and other options.
   ``It's like taking a flight. No one calls up the day before going
on a trip and says they want to pay full-price. They call up a few
days before and say they want a discount,'' she said. ``That's what
ski areas are doing.''
   Jones said the loss of the smaller resorts is hurting the
industry. Vail recently leased the Broadmoor ski area near Colorado
Springs when the city had trouble making it financially.
   ``We're losing our farm-team organization,'' he said. ``These
smaller ski areas in Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Idaho and so on are
closing their doors and eliminating the opportunities for the
potential new skier to enter the sport. No one is going to go from
Tulsa to Aspen for their first time skiing.''
   He said larger resorts have a responsibility to the smaller
resorts to ensure they survive. To do so, he said, they will have to
create mega-resorts that encompass several ski areas, such as the
complexes around Vail and Aspen in Colorado, Salt Lake City in Utah
and Tahoe on the California-Nevada border.
   The smaller resorts that are isolated probably will go out of
business, Jones said. The shakeout has already begun, with up to 25
percent of the ski resorts in the United States being offered for
sale, he said.
   ``I don't think there are that many buyers,'' he said. ``The
Japanese have been all around Colorado, Utah and Canada looking for
ski areas to purchase. But these are the long-term survivors they're
looking at.''
   Dr. Charles Goeldner, an assistant dean at the University of
Colorado in Boulder who specializes in ski economics, is more upbeat
than the operators.
   He says the market is much healthier than it looks, noting that
the number of skiers is still at an all-time high even though the
rate of growth has slowed. He also notes an echo of the baby boom is
beginning to emerge, with 4 million births a year creating a host of
new potential customers.
   ``The resources are finite and there are only so many
mountains,'' Goeldner said. ``Look at Europe and how high prices are
there. They make our skiing look like a bargain. Fifty years down
the road, our prices will mirror Europe.''

   The Reagan administration, in its last economic
forecast, issued an optimistic outlook today predicting that the
economy will grow at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate next year.
   The prediction for growth in the gross national product, which
measures the total output of goods and services, is 1.3 percentage
points higher than the consensus view of many private economists.
   Many private analysts are looking for growth to be very sluggish
next year, with the GNP expanding at a rate of 2.2 percent.
   If the private forecasts are correct and the administration is
wrong, it would mean that the budget headaches facing
President-elect George Bush will worsen in his first year in office.
   He will be forced to trim even more from government programs in
order to make up for less revenue from slower economic activity.
   However, Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of President Reagan's Council
of Economic Advisers, defended the forecast, which will provide the
basis for formulating Reagan's last budget submission to Congress in
early January.
   ``I don't want to be accused of making the final forecast of the
Reagan presidency too rosy,'' Sprinkel said.
   He said that the drought had held back growth in 1988 but with
its effects no longer being felt on farm production, growth will
look better in 1989.
   However, Sprinkel conceded that many private forecasters had
taken these factors into account in making their much lower
estimates.
   Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which surveys 51 top economists
each month, puts the consensus forecast for GNP growth next year at
2.2 percent. The administration projects that growth for 1988 will
come in at 2.6 percent, when measured from the fourth quarter of
1987.
   In other predictions, the administration forecast that
inflationary pressures will abate next year and the consumer price
index will climb by just 3.7 percent, down from an expected 4.3
percent rise this year. By contrast, many private forecasters expect
inflation to worsen next year, rising above 5 percent.
   The administration was also optimistic on interest rates,
expecting three-month Treasury bills, which on Monday shot up to
their highest levels in more than three years, to begin coming down
in 1989, averaging 6.3 percent for the year.
   The administration's interest forecasts play a key role in
determining projections on how much the government will have to pay
to
   finance the $2.6 trillion national debt, now the third biggest
spending category in the budget behind Defense and the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   The new forecast represents a downward revision in expectations
for growth in 1988 and a boost in the 1989 growth projections, when
compared to the administration's last outlook published in August.
   In August, the administration predicted growth for this year
would average 3 percent while 1989 growth would be 3.3 percent.
   Sprinkel said the severe drought had caused this expectation to
be reduced to 2.6 percent for 1988 but had allowed better farm
revenues next year would boost growth to 3.5 percent.
   The administration forecast foresees no recession in sight
through 1994, an expectation considered far too optimistic by
private analysts, who note that the current expansion is celebrating
its sixth anniversary this month, the longest in peacetime history.
   But Sprinkel insisted that recoveries do not die of old age but
rather by bad economic policies pursued by the government.
   ``It is our good fortune that we have avoided (bad policies)
which cause a recession,'' he said.
   The new economic forecast will be used in projecting the budget
deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1. Two
weeks ago, the administration said that the impact of the drought
had forced an upward revision in the deficit estimate to $132
billion.
   While that figure is likely to change slightly based on the
revised economic assumptions, Sprinkel said he did not know what
impact the new numbers would have.
   Sprinkel said the administration's economic expectations were
based on a belief that the country's trade deficit would continue to
make substantial improvements next year, triggering continued strong
business investment by companies expanding production facilities to
meet higher export demand.
   But many private economists believe the administration is being
far too optimistic.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist with Data Resources Inc.,
said he expected GNP growth next year of 2.5 percent.
   ``We are not looking for a recession next year, but we don't have
the same rosy scenario that the administration does,'' Wyss said.
   The administration has often been attacked for basing its
assumptions about budget deficits on so-called ``rosy scenarios''
about how the economy would perform only to see the deficits
escalate when the economy failed to perform up to expectations.
   The economic forecast forms the basis for estimating government
tax revenues for the budget the Reagan administration will present
to Congress in early January.
   The deficit stood at $150 billion in the budget year that ended
Sept. 30 and the administration projects it will be $132 billion for
the fiscal year which begins next Oct. 1 without actions to reduce
it.
   Based on that projection, the administration would have to find
$32 billion in deficit reductions to reach the $100 billion deficit
target established by the Gramm-Rudman law.
   Since officials have said Reagan has no intention of proposing
higher taxes in his final budget, the reductions would have to come
from steep spending cuts in domestic programs.
   And if the administration's economic forecasts prove to be too
optimistic, Bush will be faced with an even worse deficit and the
possibility that across-the-board spending cuts could be triggered
next October unless he is able to reach agreement with Congress.
   Bush and his top economic advisers are giving no indication that
they plan to deviate from his campaign pledge not to increase taxes
even though a new report said Bush's plan to balance the budget
through a ``flexible freeze'' on spending would not work.
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, said that the United States ``cannot `freeze' our
way out of the problem.'' The GAO said tax increases and cuts in
defense and Social Security must be considered in any workable plan
to eliminate the budget deficit.
   Bush, asked about the report Monday, said that it did not change
his strong opposition to tax increases.
   ``I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficit
down,'' Bush said. ``I don't remember any Republicans or Democrats
running on a please-raise-my-taxes program.''

   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission on
Tuesday for the first time authorized trading on U.S. exchanges of
futures contracts based on foreign securities.
   The commission, by a unanimous vote, decided to permit contracts
based on the Nikkei Stock Average, the Japanese Stock Inde, Japanese
government securities and British government securities.
   ``These contracts respond to the increased interest in risk
management ... both in the United States and abroad,'' CFTC
Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, noting that the contracts will be the first
in the United States to be settled in foreign currency.
   ``The global financial marketplace continues to grow and
continues to become more integrated,'' said commission member Robert
Davis. ``The contracts we consider today are yet another
manifestation of that globalization.''
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, after originally applying in
August 1986, won the right to trade futures contracts and options on
futures contracts based on the widely followed Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 large, actively-traded Japanese stocks.
   CFTC staff members noted that the CME and Tokyo Stock Exchange
had reached a surveillance and information-sharing agreement
designed to prevent manipulation in one market to profit in the
other.
   The commission authorized the Chicago Board of Trade to offer
futures contracts on the Japanese Stock Index, which is identical to
the Tokyo Stock Price Index and is based on about 1,100 ``first
section'' stocks traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. First section
stocks are larger and older companies.
   Also, the CBOT was authorized to trade contracts on 10-year
Japanese government bonds and long-term, fixed-coupon United Kingdom
gilt-edged securities, or gilts. Gilts in Great Britain are the
equivalent of U.. Treasury securities.
   Spokesman for both the CME and CBOT said there was no specific
starting date for trading the new contracts. Andrew Yemma of the CME
said the exchange would be observing the behavior of similar Nikkei
average contracts that began trading in Japan in September.

   Stock prices declined slightly today in a
drifting session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped .54 to 2,065.43 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 567 up, 790 down and
512 unchanged.
   Before the trading day began the Labor Department reported that
the consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in October. The figure
came in a bit above advance estimates on Wall Street.
   Still, analysts said traders were showing a little interest in
big-name stocks, apparently believing those issues were due for a
rebound after the market's broad decline earlier this month.
   Brokers said there also might be some buying by people hoping for
quick trading profits.
   Considerable attention has been devoted to the market's
historical tendency to post at least a small gain over the two
sessions before and after Thanksgiving.
   Whether this is simply coincidence or not, Newton Zinder at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. noted that stocks have had a net gain
over those two sessions in 33 of the past 36 years.
   Hospital Corp. of America fell 3} to 42~. The company agreed to a
management buyout proposal after apparently failing to attract other
bidders.
   Energy stocks were broadly higher as oil prices rose on signs
that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exportind the memorial on
Monday anyway.
   ``I just made it my business to come by,'' Saucedo said. ``I just
feel I needed to come by. This is history.''
   Raul Miranda, 40, was in Dallas for a convention when he
remembered the anniversary, and decided to visit the memorial before
returning to Los Angeles.
   ``It's something that I can tell my kids what happened,'' he
said. ``I'm going to tell them that 25 years ago this event changed
the history of the United States, the history of the world.''
   At Parkland, five doctors and nurses who were at the hospital
when the president arrived were to participate in a roundtable
discussion today.
   At the Texas Theater, Dallas-area artists, poets and musicians
planned a series of exhibits and live performances.
   On Sunday, 30 former Green Berets and 150 onlookers gathered at
the Dealey Plaza memorial to remember Kennedy. The members of the
U.S. Army Special Forces wore their berets _ authorized by Kennedy
in 1961 _ as they saluted four wreaths at the memorial.
   In front of a plaque at the plaza lay a small American flag with
a bouquet of flowers, about 200 yards from the memorial and across
the street from the Texas School Book Depository Building.
Authorities say Oswald opened fire from a sixth-floor window there
into Kennedy's motorcade.
   The attention given the 25th anniversary has roused more interest
than usual in the site, said Gary Mead, who drove one of several
tour buses that stopped at the memorial Monday.
   ``They're very much aware of it,'' Mead said. ``They don't want
to miss this part of the tour.''
   Dallas native Darrell Jordan, making his first visit to Dealey
Plaza, spent about an hour Monday touring the area.
   ``I've been watching all of the (television) specials the past
several months and trying to formalize my own opinions'' about what
happened, he said. ``I've been walking all over the place.''
   Jordan said he was disappointed the city and county planned no
formal anniversary ceremonies, but said he thought he understood why.
   ``They (local officials) worked 25 years to try to get the nation
to forget it,'' he said.
   The Dallas County Demo we're doing.''
   In Runnymede, England, Sen. Edward Kennedy today laid a white
rose at the foot of a British memorial to his brother, crossed
himself and mouthed a silent prayer.
   Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the late president's sister, visited his
grave and that of her brother Robert, at Arlington National Cemetery
in Virginia and said she hopes people remember ``the high points of
his life, the laughter and the vision.''
   Bob Boynton, a visitor to Dallas from St. Ignace, Mich., said he
was surprised an official ceremony was not planned, but added, ``I
also don't think Dallas should share a guilt complex over this.''
   Jean Weir said she had been in Texas the month before Kennedy was
assassinated, and found it hard to believe the tragic news 25 years
ago.
   ``The people were all so friendly,'' she said. ``I loved the
state. I was shocked to hear it happened there.''
   Mrs. Weir returned with her husband to the assassination site
Monday.
   ``I actually wanted to come say a prayer,'' she said.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade with the wheat market showing
new vigor on speculation that the Agriculture Department was
preparing to offer wheat to China.
   The rumors that the USDA would target China for a large amount of
U.S. wheat at subsidized prices apparently were rooted in the buying
activity of several grain companies, notably Cargill Inc., analysts
said.
   ``That sometimes touches off rumor-mongering but it's hard to
say'' how accurate the rumors were, said Walter Spilka, a grain
market analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   ``That rumor comes up on a two-week rotation,'' he said.
   Corn and soybean futures advanced modestly, mostly on
follow-through buying from Monday's late rally, Spilka said.
   Japan bought nearly 57,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat overnight
while Taiwan purchased 33,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 6{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.14} a bushel; corn was 1}
cents to 2 cents higher with December at $2.62} a bushel; oats were
1} cents to 3 cents higher with December at $2.09 a bushel; and
soybeans were 2{ cents lower to 6 cents higher with January at
$7.51{ a bushel.

   President-elect George Bush spoke of
working with Congress and ``bringing people together'' to fight the
federal budget deficit Tuesday, but he also said he won't bow to
others' suggestions that higher taxes are part of the solution.
   Bush made his comments to Republican governors at a meeting
during which they celebrated his election victory two weeks ago.
Later he flew to Houston for a get-acquainted meeting with Mexican
President-elect Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   While Bush was winning the presidential election, the Democrats
were widening their lead in governorships and in the Senate and
House. But Bush told the governors, ``We are on our way to becoming
the majority party in America if we don't lose sight of what is
driving our success.''
   Renewing a campaign promise, Bush said he would convene a
conference of all 50 governors ``very early in my administration''
to map plans for ``the most ambitious renaissance in education that
our nation has ever known.''
   He also pledged to seek an environmental policy of ``no net loss
of wetlands,'' but assured the governors, ``I'm not proposing
`no-growth.'''
   On the budget, he said the deficit is a pressing problem and
promised to ``work constructively'' with Congress to solve it.
   ``On the first day of my presidency, I will name negotiators to
represent the executive branch in deficit talks with the Congress,''
Bush said.
   ``This is a time for bringing people together,'' he said.
   Turning to the election, Bush defended the tenor of an often
negative campaign against Michael Dukakis, saying the heat had
``produced some light.''
   ``The fundamental lesson of this election is that the majority of
the American people agree with our philosophy,'' Bush said. ``We are
on the right side of the issues.''
   ``The American people, in voting for me, have said in clear terms
that the solution to the federal budget deficit is to get control of
spending, keep the economy expanding and not raise taxes,'' he said.
   Large crowds lined the streets in this resort to greet the next
president. A sign on an office building near the Mobile airport
flashed a belated ``Elect Bush.''

<HEAD>Isomedix Among Industry Leaders In Contract Sterilization</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By BOB McMAHON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WHIPPANY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sometimes a public health crisis can be
good for business.
   Such is the case with Isomedix Inc., a publicly held
sterilization company that has prospered as concern has escalated
about acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Isomedix is in the business of killing microorganisms that gather
on everything from cotton balls to artificial hip parts.
   In the past year, tiny Isomedix has become the world's largest
provider of contract sterilization and attracted an unsolicited
takeover offer from its principal competitor.
   ``Isomedix is emerging as one of the leaders of the industry,''
said Edward Stavetski, an analyst with W.H. Newbold's Son & Company
in Philadelphia. ``It now has sales of $20 million and will
eventually grow into a much larger business.''
   As it grows, the New Jersey firm is fending off a challenge from
Radiation Sterilizers Inc. of Fremont, Calif., a privately held
concern that has offered $9 per share, or about $45 million, to
acquire Isomedix.
   Radiation Sterilizers had sales of just over $13 million in the
year ended March 31, said Michael Goldman of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc., the sterilizer company's financial adviser.
   The offer, launched this fall, has been extended several times,
but Isomedix has flatly rejected it as inadequate. Isomedix shares
are currently trading over the counter at slightly over $7.
   ``The offer is very conditional because no financing has been
announced,'' said Susan Noonan, a spokeswoman for Isomedix. ``The
company is strongly urging the shareholders to reject it.''
   Goldman said the acquisition team is confident of its ability to
raise the necessary financing but could not firm it up until federal
regulators finish their review of the proposal.
   Because the two firms control about 85 percent of the national
market for contract sterilization, the Federal Trade Commission is
weighing the deal's antitrust implications. A ruling could come by
the time the offer's latest deadline expires on Dec. 9.
   While both companies compete head to head in several spots around
the country, Radiation Sterilizers dominates the West Coast.
Isomedix is strong in the East and elsewhere and would help fill in
some of the gaps in Radiation Sterilizers' network.
   Isomedix has been around 15 years, but the age of AIDS has
heightened the need for properly sterilized medical instruments.
   ``Five or six years ago, somewhere around 10 percent of all
medical devices were radiation sterilized,'' said George Dietz, the
company's executive vice president. ``Today, that's up to 40 to 45
percent.''
   Though too small to be followed by analysts from larger brokerage
houses, Isomedix has already made its presence known in the health
care field, Stavetski says.
   For example, Isomedix sterilizes hospital gowns for Johnson &
Johnson, purifies saline solution for Bausch & Lomb Inc., and
provides similar sterilization services for about 600 smaller
companies in the United States and Canada, company officials say.
   The company's third-quarter sales were $4.4 million, up 37.5
percent from $3.2 million for the same quarter last year. Earnings
for the quarter totaled $513,310, or 10 cents per share, about 2{
times the $144,481, or 3 cents per share, recorded for the same
quarter last year.
   Earnings might have been even higher were it not for the takeover
fight, which drained an estimated 2 cents per share from the bottom
line during the quarter, Noonan said.
   Isomedix had a net gain for the first nine months of $1.9
million, or 38 cents a share, up from $514,917, or 11 cents a share
last year.
   The company uses low-level radiation produced by Cobalt-60 to
sterilize objects. It plans to expand into other processes,
including gas sterilizers, according to Noonan.
   The amount of time objects require treatment vary with the item
and degree of sterilization required, though it is usually one to
three hours, Dietz says. The objects, whether they be ointments,
makeup or surgical gloves, are placed in metal carriers that are run
on monorails through an automated chamber. Most of the items never
need to leave their packages.
   The primary purchasers of the sterilized goods are manufacturers
of prepackaged disposable medical devices and other industrial and
consumer products.
   Isomedix is counting on steady growth and hopes to spread
internationally. Dietz says if federal officials approve the
irradiation of food, the company could grow dramatically.
   ``If and when irradiation is used, it would be an explosion in
use,'' Stavetski said.
   Currently, the company's demand falls into two areas _ those
disposable medical devices used in operating rooms such as catheters
and surgical clothes, and consumer items like bandages and baby
bottle nipples, Dietz says.
   Stavetski attributes Isomedix success to a strong management team
that has positioned the company to take advantage of technological
changes.
   Isomedix has 200 employees working in nine North American
facilities including Toronto, Chicago, Salt Lake City and Boston.
All the company's customers are within a 300-mile radius of a
facility, enabling them to shuttle goods in and out for treatment.

<HEAD>Former Allegis Chief Invests In New Vacation Directory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Ferris, whose dream of making Allegis
Corp. a complete travel company fizzled, announced a new venture
Tuesday _ a one-stop source book for vacations ranging from dude
ranches to beach resorts.
   The former Allegis chairman is a chief investor and partner in
``The North American Vacation Brochure Directory,'' which unites
some of the travel industry's major leaders, including the Travel
Industry Association of America and Family Vacation Services, a
major supplier of vacation brochures.
   ``Until now most people have found it necessary to spend a lot of
time and effort writing or phoning numerous offices to request
vacation brochures,'' said Marvin Williams, president of Family
Vacation Services in Columbus, Ohio.
   ``Our directory solves this hassle by giving the consumer an
opportunity to `browse' through the vacation facilities and services
listed, fill out one of the enclosed order cards for the desired
brochures, and then receive them in a single envelope mailed from
the FVS fulfillment center,'' Williams said.
   The directory, a $4.95 booklet to be sold at bookstores,
newsstands and supermarkets, will be available in February. In
addition to listing thousands of hotels, resorts, campgrounds,
historical sites and other vacation spots, it will include calendars
of seasonal events for all 50 states and the provinces of Canada.
   Coupons for discounts at various vacation spots listed also are
included in the directory, published by Meredith Corp., whose
publications include Better Homes and Gardens magazine.
   So far, 6,000 vendors have agreed to list their vacation
offerings.
   Merchants receive a free directory listing and are billed when a
consumer specifically requests their brochures. There is no charge
for the consumer for the brochures.
   Ferris said he became involved at the request of Paula Spence,
president of Hameroff, Milenthal, Spence, Inc., a Columbus-based
travel promotion agency and one of the partners in the new directory.
   ``After leaving Allegis, I received a lot of interesting mail,''
Ferris said. ``This was pretty interesting. I immediately recognized
that here was an idea that the industry had long needed and wanted.''
   Ferris declined to say how much he had invested in the project.
   ``We think it's a service to the consumer and a service to the
industry,'' said Ferris, 52, who resigned from Allegis in June 1987
amid turmoil within the company's various units, including United
Airlines.
   With Ferris gone and his plans to create a travel conglomerate
defeated, Allegis changed its name back to UAL Corp. and launched a
restructuring program to sell off its non-airline businesses: Hilton
International Co., Hertz Co. and Westin Hotel Co.
   Ferris said if the directory proves to be a hit, the partnership
plans to create a computerized service offering personalized
vacation planning for consumers.

   The dollar continued to fall Tuesday against all
major currencies in cautious trading despite reports of some
central-bank intervention.
   Gold prices rebounded. Republic National Bank quoted bullion at
$418 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up $2.50 from late Monday.
   Currency dealers reported the Federal Reserve bought modest
amounts of dollars with Japanese yen throughout the trading session,
but they said the intervention had only limited impact on the
bearish market.
   ``There's a preponderance of (dollar) selling,'' said George
DeLuna, a vice president and trader at Irving Trust Co.
   Traders have become increasingly worried about the lingering
trade and budget deficits and the ultimate effect of both on the
economy.
   At issue is whether President-elect George Bush, who has vowed
not to raise taxes, and the Democrat-controlled Congress can agree
on necessary spending cuts.
   Bush told a gathering of Republican governors Tuesday in Point
Clear, Ala., that he considered the deficit a pressing problem and
promised to ``work constructively'' with Congress. He said he
planned to name budget negotiators to represent the executive branch
during his first day on the job.
   But DeLuna said, ``The market is looking for something more
specific,'' and without that, the dollar will remain weak.
   Dealers said they expected fairly quiet trading this week because
of a Japanese holiday on Wednesday and the Thanksgiving holiday in
the United States on Thursday.
   In Tokyo, traders said the Japanese central bank made occasional
dollar purchases Tuesday, but the dollar fell 0.74 yen to a closing
121.78 yen. The dollar was quoted at 121.75 yen in London, and fell
in New York to 121.315 yen from 122.025 yen late Monday.
   In London, the British pound jumped to a five-month high of
$1.8305 from $1.8175 late Monday. Later, in New York, sterling
fetched $1.83375, up from $1.8235.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.71855 West German marks, down from 1.72815; 1.44575
Swiss francs, down from 1.45495; 1.2008 Canadian dollars, down from
1.20695; 5.8765 French francs, down from 5.9070; and 1,277.50
Italian lire, down from 1,284.575.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Monday: 1.7230 West
German marks, down from 1.7305; 1.4545 Swiss francs, down from
1.4575; 5.9090 French francs, down from 5.9305; 1.9480 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9550; 1.2002 Canadian dollars, down from
1.2117; and 1,285.00 Italian lire, down from 1,288.62.
   Gold bullion prices were boosted by the weaker dollar and higher
oil prices, dealers said.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
rose to $417.70 a troy ounce from $415.80 late Monday.
   In London gold rose to a late bid of $419.65 a troy ounce, up
from $416.75 bid late Monday. Gold rose in Zurich to $418.90 an
ounce from $416.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 75 cents to a closing bid of
$418.04 an ounce.
   Silver prices gained ground. On the New York Comex, silver
bullion rose to $6.061 a troy ounce from $6.010 on Monday. It rose
in London to a late bid price of $6.11 an ounce, up from $6.04 bid
late Monday.

   The Coca-Cola Co. announced plans Tuesday for
``The World Of Coca-Cola,'' a four-story attraction presenting the
history of the 100-year-old soft drink giant.
   The 45,000-square-foot attraction will be constructed in downtown

Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Roberto C. Goizueta said.
   Plans include ``the most innovative neon outdoor sign ever
created for Coca-Cola.'' A giant neon Coke sign at Margaret Mitchell
Square, which had become an Atlanta landmark, was demolished several
years ago.

   Energy issues and a smattering of other blue
chips led the stock market to a small gain in quiet trading Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.73 to 2,077.70.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 729 up, 714
down and 528 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 127 million shares,
against 120.43 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 151.57 million shares.
   Before the trading day began the Labor Department reported that
the consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in October. The figure
came in a bit above advance estimates on Wall Street.
   Still, analysts said traders were showing some tentative interest
in big-name stocks, apparently believing those issues were due for a
rebound after the market's broad decline earlier this month.
   Brokers said there also might be buying by people hoping for
quick trading profits.
   Considerable attention has been devoted to the market's
historical tendency to post at least a small gain over the two
sessions before and after Thanksgiving.
   Whether this is simply coincidence or not, Newton Zinder at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. noted that stocks have had a net gain
over those two sessions in 33 of the past 36 years.
   The pattern failed to hold last year, Zinder added, when the Dow
fell 53 points as Wall Street was still struggling to regain its
bearings in the aftermath of Black Monday on Oct. 19.
   Among Tuesday's volume leaders, Hospital Corp. of America fell 3|
to 43. The company agreed to a management buyout proposal after
apparently failing to attract other bidders.
   Energy stocks were broadly higher as oil prices rose on reports
that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
might be closer to agreement on new production quotas.
   Amoco gained 1\ to 71]; Chevron 1 to 44{; Atlantic Richfield 1]
to 78[; Mobil } to 42|, and Exxon { to 42|.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, International Business Machines
rose 1] to 117; American Telephone & Telegraph { to 28{; General
Electric \ to 44, and General Motors } to 81].
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $7.13 billion, or 0.27
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.45 to 150.55.
   Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 1.41 to 307.55, and S&P's
500-stock composite index was up .99 at 267.21.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged
up .29 to 365.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 288.22, up 1.05.

<HEAD>Surge In Oil Prices Triggers Precious-Metals Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices surged Tuesday, helping trigger moderate gains
in precious metals futures prices and lifting silver prices from
20-month lows.
   On other markets, copper futures surged; orange juice futures
plunged; sugar was up sharply; grains and soybeans were mostly
higher; livestock and meat were mixed; and stock-index futures
advanced.
   Energy futures traded up their permitted daily limits at
mid-session on the New York Mercantile Exchange on indications that
OPEC oil ministers meeting in Vienna eventually would agree on new
crude-oil production limits.
   Some heating-oil contracts retained their 2-cents-a-gallon gains
into the close but most other energy prices eased slightly in
afternoon trading after Iran and Iraq renewed the verbal feuding
that has held up progress on a plan to curb oil output, analysts
said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 88 cents to 92 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in January at $13.86 a barrel;
heating oil was 1.70 cents to 2 cents higher with December at 45.44
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.01 cents to 1.99 cents
higher with December at 45.33 cents a gallon.
   The inflation-sensitive precious-metals markets ``were trading
off the back of the oil all day long,'' said Jerry Rothman of Elders
Futures Inc. in New York.
   Gold and silver futures posted sharp gains in morning trading on
New York's Commodity Exchange, then fell back as oil prices eased.
   Nevertheless, Rothman said he expected gold to end its slide of
the previous three sessions, rally on tightening supplies and pull
silver higher as well.
   Gold settled $1.60 to $1.80 higher with December at $418.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 5 cents to 7.1 cents higher with December at
$6.075 a troy ounce.
   Copper futures surged on the Comex on a mix of bullish technical
signals and renewed concerns about the near-term availability of
physical supplies, said Bernard Savaiko, metals analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   Copper settled 1 cent to 9.10 cents higher with December at
$1.428 a pound.
   Prices of frozen concentrated orange juice futures plunged on the
New York Cotton Exchange on a combination of weak chart signals and
expectations for abundant orange harvests in both Florida and
Brazil, analysts said.
   But while improved growing conditions have boosted the outlook
for the Florda orange crop, ``we are approaching the winter season
and there's always speculation that a cold front will come into the
citrus groves of Orlando and Tampa,'' said Bert Ruiz, an analyst
with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
   Orange juice settled 2 cents to 2.5 cents lower with January at
$1.6835 a pound.
   Sugar futures prices leaped on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa
Exchange after the West German statistics firm F.O. Licht reduced
its estimate for the 1988-89 European sugar beet crop by 750,000
metric tons.
   Analysts also tied the surge in sugar prices to spillover buying
from the oil markets on the neighboring New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Sugar settled .10 cent to .49 cent higher with the active March
contract at 10.65 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade with the wheat market showing new vigor on
speculation that the Agriculture Department was preparing to offer
wheat to China.
   But ``that rumor comes up on a two-week rotation,'' said Walter
Spilka, a grain market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
in New York.
   Corn and soybean futures advanced modestly, mostly on
follow-through buying from Monday's late rally, Spilka said.
   Wheat settled { cent to 6} cents higher with December at $4.15 a
bushel; corn was 1} cents to 2\ cents higher with December at $2.62}
a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 3 cents higher with December at
$2.09 a bushel; and soybeans were 2\ cents lower to 5 cents higher
with January at $7.50} a bushel.
   Cattle futures ended modestly higher in light trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange in response to stronger cash markets,
analysts said.
   Pork futures finished mostly lower, pressured by Monday's USDA
monthly cold-storage report, which showed supplies of frozen pork
products at a record Nov. 1 high.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .40 cent higher with December at
72.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 cent higher
with January at 81.62 cents a pound; live hogs were 1.20 cents lower
to .08 cent higher with December at 39.75 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .45 cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at
42.37 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures advanced moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for December delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 settled 1.45 points higher at 268.35.

<HEAD>First Sorghum Sale Announced</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union has bought 500,000 metric tons
of U.S. grain sorghum for delivery in the marketing year that began
Sept. 1, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Spokeswoman Vivian Ramey said it was the first time that the
Soviets have purchased U.S. sorghum. Traditionally, corn and wheat
are the chief grains for import, along with soybeans and soybean
meal.
   For example, more than 5.9 million tons of U.S. corn have been
sold to the Soviet Union for delivery in 1988-89.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or sorghum grain, or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The
500,000 tons of sorghum would be about 19.7 million bushels or about
11 million hundredweight.
   Sorghum prices last month averaged around $4.21 per 100 pounds or
$2.36 per bushel, according to USDA reports. Thus, the sale could
have a U.S. farm value of about $46 million.

<TEXT>
   Hospital Corp. of America stock sagged
Tuesday in the wake of its approval of a $3.6 billion buyout offer
from a management-led group, and analysts say they expect the
company's new owners will probably sell off up to $750 million in
assets if the deal goes through.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, HCA lost $3.62{ a
share to close at $43, apparently reflecting disappointment that a
higher bid did not emerge.
   HCA's board agreed late Monday to sell the hospital management
giant for $43 a share in cash and $8 in securities to TF Investments
Inc., a company formed by HCA management and headed by HCA Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Thomas F. Frist Jr. HCA has 71.4 million
outstanding common shares.
   The deal will be sumbmitted to shareholders of the nation's
largest health care concern sometime in February, officials said.
   HCA said the managers had enough financial backing to complete
the deal, with eight lenders putting up $4 billion and investors
committing $300 million for an ownership interest.
   But one securities analyst said selling off some assets will
probably be necessary.
   Ken Abramowitz of the firm Sanford C. Bernstein in New York said
he expects management to sell up to $750 million of the company's
$5.2 billion in assets.
   ``It's just that in an LBO (leveraged buyout), you don't have the
luxury of keeping non-earning assets,'' Abramowitz said. In a
leveraged buyout, the buyers often borrow heavily against the assets
of the company, planning to repay the debt either through the
company's earnings or selling assets.
   Thomas McGinnis Jr. with Eberstadt Fleming in New York said it's
almost certain that the management will have to sell off assets
because the equity, or stock ownership, in the deal is relatively
low.
   Joyce Albers, an analyst with First Boston in New York, said the
company might sell its interest in Equicor, a health plans joint
venture.
   Albers said managers could also sell their interest in
HealthTrust, an employee-owned company in which HCA owns preferred
stock and bonds.
   Victor L. Campbell, vice president of corporate relations, said
it was too early to discuss the possibility of selling divisions of
HCA.
   ``There are no plans and really no discussion of that at this
point,'' he said Tuesday. ``We just got an agreement last night and
now it has to go through a process of shareholder agreement which we
hope to be complete by late February.''
   Campbell said the management group expects to receive shareholder
approval.
   ``This best serves the company and all its publics,'' he said.
``The main reason that HCA had been a public company dating back to
1969 was in the '60s, '70s and early '80s, there was the need for
capital because it was a growth industry, for building new
hospitals, for expansion. Today it is a more mature industry, the
need for capital is no longer there.''
   ``Clearly health care stocks and hospital stocks in general have
been out of favor with the public for some time now,'' he said.

   The Reagan administration issued its final
economic forecast on Tuesday, optimistically predicting that the
economy will expand at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate next year.
   However, private economists said the projection was far too rosy
and would spell big headaches for President-elect George Bush in his
efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   The administration also was optimistic on the outlook for
inflation, predicting it would ease next year. The forecast also
said interest rates, which have shot up recently because of
inflationary fears, would drop as well. Both of the assumptions are
disputed by private economists.
   The economic forecast provides the underpinning for the
administration's estimates on government spending and revenues and
the shortfall between the two _ the budget deficit.
   The administration often has been criticized for basing its
budget estimates on rosy scenarios, only to see the deficit swell
far higher when the optimistic growth outlook did not come about.
   This estimate will form the basis for the administration's final
budget to Congress in early January. The document will cover the
1990 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1.
   Joseph Wright, head of the Office and Managment and Budget, said
in an interview after the economic forecast was released that the
revised growth projections would add another $3 billion to the
budget deficit for 1992, pushing it up to $135 billion. That means
Reagan will have to come up with $35 billion in deficit reductions
to meet the Gramm-Rudman target of a $100 billion deficit in 1990.
   Officials said the higher deficit figure resulted primarily from
a slightly lower growth estimate for 1988 caused by the loss in farm
income due to the drought.
   Beryl Sprinkel, Reagan's chief economic adviser, told reporters
the administration will meet the Gramm-Rudman target and will
project a balanced budget in 1993 without resorting to increased
taxes.
   However, private economists were skeptical, contending that
Reagan's final budget will make Bush's deficit challenge even more
difficult because it is based on unrealistic economic assumptions.
   They said that when the economy's actual performance is reviewed
at mid-year, Bush may have to propose even deeper spending cuts to
make up for lost revenues or face the prospect of doing what Bush
has pledged repeatedly not to do: raise taxes. Failing both of
those, the Gramm-Rudman law could trigger automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts.
   ``To use the administration's estimate for budget policy is very
risky,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, head of the WEFA Group, a Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., economic consulting firm. ``We've already seen signs
that the economy is slowing.''
   Blue Chip Economic Indicators, which surveys 51 top economists
monthly, said its consensus forecast for economic growth next year
is 2.2 percent, a full 1.3 percentage points lower than the
administration's revised forecast.
   But Sprinkel insisted that private economists were being too
pessimistic and were failing to take into account the boost the
economy will receive next year, once the effects of last summer's
severe drought are no longer felt.
   ``I do not want to be accused of making the final forecast of the
Reagan presidency too rosy,'' Sprinkel said.
   Sprinkel said the drought had reduced GNP growth by 0.7
percentage point this year and would boost growth by 0.8 percentage
point next year.
   Sprinkel said without the drought, growth this year would have
been 3.3 percent, exactly on target with the administration's
revised estimate last August. The administration on Tuesday put 1988
growth at 2.6 percent, when measured from the fourth quarter of 1987.
   In August, the administration projected 1989 growth at 3.3
percent, which was revised to the 3.5 percent estimate in the newest
forecast, based on a better rebound in the farm sector than
previously believed.
   In other predictions, the administration said inflationary
pressures will ease substantially next year. It predicted consumer
prices will rise by just 3.7 percent, down from an annual rate of
4.6 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
   However, other economists expect inflation will worsen next year,
climbing above 5 percent because of a rebound in oil prices and
production constraints in this country.
   The administration also was optimistic on interest rates,
expecting three-month Treasury bills, which on Monday shot up to
their highest levels in more than three years, to begin coming down
in 1989, averaging 6.3 percent for the year.
   The interest forecast is used to estimate how much the government
will have to pay to finance the $2.6 trillion national debt, now the
third largest spending category behind Defense and the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   The administration forecast that unemployment next year would
average 5.2 percent, declining to 5.1 percent in 1990 and then 5
percent in 1991 through 1994. The civilian unemployment rate was 5.3
percent in October.
   The administration forecast sees no recession through 1994,
projecting growth above 3 percent for the next six years.
   Economists also disputed this outlook, calling it highly
unrealistic to expect that the current expansion, which has lasted a
peacetime record of six years, could last that long.
   But Sprinkel insisted that recoveries do not die of old age but
rather by bad economic policies pursued by the government.
   Sprinkel said the administration's economic expectations were
based on a belief that the country's trade deficit would continue to
make substantial improvements next year, triggering continued strong
business investment by companies expanding production facilities to
meet higher export demand.
   Sprinkel also denied that there was any conflict between the
administration's forecast for growth above 3 percent and the
economic outlook at the Federal Reserve that the economy, at this
advanced stage of the recovery, should be growing at a slower 2
percent to 2.5 percent rate in order to avoid triggering run-away
inflation.

<HEAD>Delaware Court Dismisses Coniston Challenge of Anti-Takeover Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investor group whose buyout offer was snubbed
last month by TW Services Inc. said Tuesday that a Delaware court
dismissed on procedural grounds the group's challenge of the state's
anti-takeover law.
   New York-based Coniston Partners said the U.S. District Court for
Delaware on Tuesday rejected its suit to have a portion of
Delaware's anti-takeover law declared unconstitutional.
   The court based its action on the fact that Coniston's partial
tender offer for TW Services is not affected by the Delaware law,
Coniston said.
   After its initial $28-a-share offer was rejected, Coniston
announced in late October that it would begin a $29-a-share tender
offer as the first step of a proposed $1.14 billion takeover of the
food services giant. The two-step buyout plan was aimed at
sidestepping restrictions of the anti-takeover law of Delaware,
where TW Services is incorporated.
   The statute prohibits a hostile acquirer who buys 15 percent of a
company's stock from completing a takeover for three years, unless
it immediately gets approval from 85 percent of the company's
outstanding shares, excluding its own.
   Coniston's first-step cash tender offer for 15.75 million shares,
amounting to about $456.75 million, would give the investors a
majority stake in TW Services. The group already owns around 19
percent of TW Services' 48.5 million common shares outstanding.
   In a statement announcing the Delaware court ruling, Coniston
said it remains ``fully committed to acquiring TW Services and
intends to continue to explore alternatives to meet that objective.''
   In addition to its 1,200 Denny's and its 400 Hardee's fast-food
franchise restaurants, TW Services also runs Canteen Corp., a food
services company, and a small nursing home chain.

<HEAD>AT&T To Offer New Telephone Information Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is proposing
to start a new nationwide service that will connect callers with
companies offering information on topics ranging from food
preparation to legal advice.
   Callers from anywhere in the country could dial 1-900 plus a
seven-digit number and pay a flat rate to reach any of these
services, and the charges would appear on their monthly phone bill,
AT&T said.
   The new service may appeal to some companies that now offer
toll-free 800 service. If some of these companies switched to the
new 900 service, consumers could have to pay for some services they
now get free.
   AT&T envisions the new service being used, for example, by
companies interested in selling financial, investment, legal or
medical advice. A food company might offer recipes, and a consumer
product manufacturer might offer household maintenance tips, the
telephone company said.
   ``The purpose is to get information when you need it at a flat
rate from anywhere in the country,'' said AT&T spokesman Ralph
Dobriner.
   Charges, which would be determined by the sponsor of the service,
would range from 75 cents to $2 for the first minute and from 50
cents to $1 for each additional minute.
   AT&T filed plans for its new MultiQuest service with the Federal
Communications Commission on Monday. The company said it wants to
start the service Jan. 5.
   Dobriner said that while some switching from 800 service to 900
service may occur, many companies will stick with the toll-free
service because it better suits its needs.
   Companies that might be inclined to switch are those that offer
information, as opposed to hotels and airlines, which use 800
numbers primarily for taking reservations, he said.
   ``This is a value-added information service,'' he said.
   Bruce Kushnick of National TeleVoice, a marketing research and
consulting firm that does work for telephone companies including
AT&T, predicts some switching will occur because many companies see
the cost of 800 service ``going through the roof.''
   However, Blair Pleasant, a telecommunications analyst with the
Yankee Group in Boston, doesn't foresee many companies switching
services, but rather that that companies will find different
applications for 900 services.
   However, she believes that 900 services are ``a novelty,'' and
that ``when people realize how much they're going to have to pay for
900 service ... they won't be as apt to use it.''
   MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co., AT&T's
two largest competitors, have said they plan to offer a similar
service.
   AT&T has another 1-900 service, but it provides only recorded
information and is limited in the number of businesses it can serve.
   Kushnick estimates that AT&T's current 900 business and the 900
and 700 business of other companies amounts to $450 million in
revenues. He projects that these pay services will become a $2.9
billion a year industry by 1992.

<HEAD>FAA Cites Continued Problems In Delta Cockpits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While there have been improvements, pilots at
Delta Air Lines continue to have problems with cockpit crew
coordination and at times skirt established procedures, the Federal
Aviation Administration said Tuesday.
   The FAA said that while Delta's management ``has taken strong and
positive action'' in response to a critical review of the airline's
operations 14 months ago, much of its program has yet to be fully
implemented.
   ``Both line operations and training were found to be improved,''
an FAA inspection team reported in a summary of findings from
follow-up checks conducted at the Atlanta-based airline in early
October.
   A copy of the report became available Tuesday.
   Delta spokesman Bill Berry said the company was ``in general
agreement with the report.''
   Delta has taken aggressive steps to deal with problems discovered
by the FAA in its audit more than a year ago, Berry said, although
the FAA investigators found some still-existing problems that will
be addressed by programs just starting up.
   ``We think they gave us a pretty good report, although they
recognized there are some things we're just starting to do,'' he
said.
   Delta's cockpit operations and its training program came under
intense FAA scrutiny in the summer of 1987 after a series of errors
by Delta pilots brought the airline close to having several serious
accidents including a near-collision over the Atlantic.
   In a report in September l987, the FAA chastised Delta for
``lapses of discipline'' and allowing a ``breakdown of
communications (and) ... coordination'' in its cockpits.
   More recently, federal investigators have focused on pilot
performance in connection with the crash last August of a Delta
Boeing 727 as it attempted to take off from the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport. Authorities are trying to determine whether the three-man
crew forgot to properly set the wing flaps, causing the crash.
   The FAA's latest report on Delta makes no mention of the Aug. 31
crash in which 14 of the 108 people aboard were killed.
   It said the review in early October was aimed at re-examining
Delta's operations and training programs and to determine what
corrective actions have been taken since the l987 audit.
   While there were improvements noted, the FAA said ``deficiencies
identified in the previous audit were observed ... (including)
ineffective crew coordination and failure to follow established
procedures'' during regularly scheduled flights.
   Delta has more than 6,500 pilots.
   The FAA said that Delta's check pilots should be tougher on line
pilots during proficiency tests. It said the pilots should be
exposed to a ``greater degree of ... challenge'' rather than held to
``minimum standards.''
   Delta's management, said the FAA, has improved its operations and
training manuals during the past year but ``fundamental changes to
checklists and procedures are still pending'' and are not yet
reflected in the cockpit.
   ``Some of the major actions taken by management have not yet
become fully operational or have not yet become effective,'' the FAA
said. It cited as an example, Delta's revised ``cockpit resource
management training program'' which has been under development for
some time but is not scheduled to be implemented until next January.
   It noted that Delta plans to introduce next month a series of
changes in the way pilots conduct checklists before departure and
prior to landing. The role of each pilot will become more clearly
defined with pilots using the ``challenge and response technique''
more widely to guard against oversights.
   The FAA said it plans to continue monitoring the airline's
progress on implementing the various programs already under way.
   ``The ultimate effectiveness of these actions will depend on the
company's commitment and the individual acceptance by middle
management and the pilot group,'' the FAA said.
   The FAA's special review of Delta's training and cockpit
procedures comes at a time of increased agency interest in how
pilots perform in the cockpit.
   That interest was sharpened after the August l987 crash in
Detroit of a Northwest Airlines jet in which the two pilots forgot
to set the wing flaps, preventing the aircraft from gaining proper
lift.
   At the time of the Detroit accident, the FAA's attention already
had been aimed at Delta because of a string of unusual errors by
Delta pilots during the spring and summer of l987.
   That year, a Delta Lockheed L-1011 strayed 60 miles off course
over the North Atlantic and almost collided with a Continental
Airlines jumbo jet after the Delta crew entered the wrong navigation
coordinates in a computer.
   A captain of another Delta plane mistakenly turned off both
engines causing the jet to come within 500 feet of ditching into the
Pacific before the engines were restarted. Other 1987 incidents
involved pilots landing at the wrong airport and on the wrong runway.

<HEAD>Media General Announces Sale Of Broadcast Services Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. said Tuesday it had agreed to
sell its broadcast services unit, a leading buyer of radio and
television time for advertisers, to the senior managers of the
operation.
   Terms of the sale, which is expected to be completed by January
1989, were not disclosed, but Media General said it planned to take
an after-tax charge of $35 million to $40 million on the sale in the
fourth quarter.
   Media General earned $11.4 million, or 40 cents a share, on
revenue of $183.7 million in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Donald B. Miller, who has headed the broadcast services unit
since 1986, will be chairman and chief executive officer of the new
company.
   Media General, which has interest in newspapers, broadcasting and
cable telellsion, bought the broadcast services operation in 1982.
It has specialized in buying television and radio time for
advertisers and also provides media planning, research and analysis
for its clients.
   The new company will buy essentially all of Media General
Broadcast Services assets except its broadcast production operation
and a travel agency, and will assume the broadcast services unit's
liabilities to stations.
   The bradcast services unit is not expected to post a profit this
year on revenue of more than $75 million, but Miller said he expects
the new company will be profitable in 1989.
   ``The company will be run by hands-on, day-to-day managers with
reduced corporate overhead, and without the financial drain of other
ancillary operations,'' he said. ``We'll be leaner, more targeted
and better able to respond quickly to constantly changing market
conditions.''
   James A. Linen IV, executive vice president of Media General,
said the divestiture of Media General Broadcast Services ``will
provide both short-range and longer-term economic benefits through
reduction of various liabilities and associated termination costs.''
   Media General publishes daily and weekly newspapers in cities
including Richmond, Tampa, Fla., and Winston-Salem, N.C.; owns
network affiliated television stations in Florida and South Carolina
and has cable television interests in Virginia.

<HEAD>Interco Boosts Special Dividend Paid In Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc.'s board of directors on Tuesday
declared the final special dividend it will pay under the
restructuring and recapitalization it undertook to thwart a $2.7
billion hostile takeover bid.
   The adjustments approved by the board brought the total value of
cash and securities under the restructuring dividend to
approximately $71 per share, according to Harvey Saligman, Interco's
chairman and chief executive.
   Cardinal Acquisition Corp., headed by brothers Steven M. and
Mitchell P. Rales of Washington, D.C., last week abandoned their
$74-a-share takeover attempt after Interco repeatedly resisted
attempts to negotiate a buyout.
   The group controls 8.7 percent of Interco's common shares, and
has indicated it may seek control of the furniture and apparel
company in the future.
   Interco stock closed down $1 at $64.75 a share in New York Stock
Exchange trading Tuesday.
   The dividend declared Tuesday was the third and final special
dividence of the restructuring. It consists partly of $5.60
per-share in principal amount in 14.5 percent pay-in-kind debentures
and $9 a share of $100-a-share stated value preferred stock.
   Total payments under the restructuring thus include $38.60 per
share in cash, declared in the first and second special dividends,
plus securities that bring the total declared value to $71 a share.
   Shareholders also are to receive warrants to acquire 22 percent
of Interco's common shares.
   Interco said a supplement to its previously distributed
information statement describing the restructuring and the special
dividends will be mailed soon to shareholders.
   As announced in September, a $2.8 billion Interco restructuring
and recapitalization plan valued by the company at $76 a share could
include the sale of most of the furniture and apparel maker's 20
companies, which include Ethan Allan and Broyhill furniture, and
Florsheim and Converse shoes.
   The Raleses' hostile tender offer, valued at $2.7 billion,
expired last Wednesday and was not extended.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's first public copy
centers will begin opening early next year under a joint venture
between Xerox Corp.'s European affiliate and a Soviet agency.
   ``The Soviets have purchased copy machines for use within
organizations, but there have never been copy shops as you see in
the West which provide access to ordinary businesses who don't have
specialized equipment or the general public,'' said Ralph Land,
general manager for Xerox affiliate Rank Xerox Ltd. in London.
   ``Our Soviet partners say we will be surprised with the pent-up
demand,'' he said Tuesday.
   Under the agreement, the Eastern Export Operations Division of
Rank Xerox Ltd. will cooperate with Vnesghtorgizdat, the
international division of the Soviet state publishing organization.
Together they will open, equip and train staff for the copy centers.
   The shops, to be called Reprocentres, will open first in Moscow.
They will will provide photocopying services for the foreign
business community, paid for in convertible currency, and for Soviet
businesses, institutions and individuals, payable in rubles.
   While photocopying machines are in some offices, only specified
Soviet workers are allowed to use them. None have been available to
the general public until now.
   Land said he did not know how many copy centers eventually would
be opened. He said only one shop would be opened initially, but ``we
believe it will be successful and hope to be able to open many
more.''
   Rank Xerox and Vnesghtorgizdat also will establish a specialized
copying service that, for the first time, will make artistic,
historic and archival Russian documents available for sale to
Western universities and institutions.
   ``There is historical material sitting in the Soviet archives
that is much required by scholars in the West and we will be able to
copy that material and sell it to the western universities and think
tanks,'' Land said.
   Paul Bushkovitch, associate professor of history and chairman of
the Soviet and East European Studies Council at Yale University,
called the deal a ``breakthrough in communications.''
   He said of the Soviets: ``I think they got tired of doing things
the old way. When you deal with a Soviet office, you get, at best, a
carbon copy. ...There's one copy of everything. This is no way to
run things any more.''

<HEAD>Chevron Adopts Stockholder Rights Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. announced Tuesday it had
adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to prevent hostile
takeovers.
   The company's board of directors said no hostile bids had been
made for Chevron, the nation's fourth-largest oil company, and
blamed the current era of mergers and acquisitions for prompting the
move.
   ``We have instituted the stockholder rights plan in recognition
of an extremely active merger and acquisition environment in which
hostile, non-negotiated takeover bids have become common,'' board
Chairman George M. Keller said in a statement.
   The past two months have seen several takeover fights of
unprecedented size, including the record $20 billion-plus tussle to
acquire RJR Nabisco Inc. and last month's $13.1 billion agreement by
Philip Morris Cos. Inc. to acquire Kraft Inc.
   Details of the Chevron plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed
to all stockholders after Dec. 15, the company said.
   As part of the plan, the board Tuesday also declared a rights
dividend payable on shares of Chevron's common stock. For each share
of Chevron common stock held at the close of business Dec. 15,
stockholders will receive one right.
   The rights consist of a contingent right to purchase, under
certain circumstances, one or more fractional shares of a newly
created series of perferred stock or other securities in some cases.
   The rights would become exercisable and trade independently from
Chevron's common stock 10 days after the acquisition of 20 percent
or more of the voting power of Chevron, the company said.
   The rights expire Nov. 22, 1998, unless redeemed earlier by the
company.
   Keller said many other public companies have adopted similar
plans to enable their boards of directors to protect stockholders
from offers they consider inadequate and coercive.

<HEAD>IRS Investigation at Blinder, Robinson Apparently Winds Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents apparently finished their search of
records at Blinder, Robinson & Co. on Tuesday, in an investigation
that officials said covered the same companies scrutinized in a 1987
securities probe.
   The search began Saturday morning when 24 federal agents armed
with a search warrant entered the firm's headquarters in suburban
Englewood and began going through records.
   Denver spokesmen for the Internal Revenue Service and U.S.
Attorney's office have refused comment on the purpose of the probe.
The order, from the U.S. Attorney's office in Las Vegas, Nev., is
sealed.
   Nevada sources said the investigation involved laundering of
money skimmed from businesses in Las Vegas.
   Blinder, Robinson had been the subject of earlier federal
investigations involving allegations of fraud, stock price markups
and misrepresentation.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has two actions ongoing
against the firm, including one that seeks to bar the firm's
president, Meyer Blinder, permanently from the securities business
and suspend the company's new issues underwritings for two years.
   Blinder, Robinson also has been hit by investigations and
penalties by the National Association of Securities Dealers, the
industry's self-regulatory body.
   The search warrant issued in Denver named 53 investors and 16
publicly traded securities, company executives said. None of the
investors is a Blinder, Robinson employee or has an account with the
brokerage, said Senior Vice President Steven B. Theys.
   ``Of the 16 issues, Blinder, Robinson probably had some market
activity in eight or 10 of them, but none of those are underwitten
by Blinder, Robinson,'' Theys said.
   Theys said the information sought by the federal agents was
turned over to the SEC as part of an investigation last year.
   Theys said the federal agents worked in a reduced number at the
office on Tuesday, and all left about 4:30 p.m. He said the Blinder,
Robinson staff and operations were at full strength Tuesday, about
150 workers.
   A skeleton crew of about 60 worked at the office Monday, when
people going into the building had to show identification to federal
guards and those leaving were subject to searches of their
briefcases.

   Crude oil traders are moving cautiously as OPEC
oil ministers continue meetings aimed at resolving the cartel's
production crisis.
   Prices edged higher Monday in light trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for January delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, rose 7 cents from Friday's
close to settle at $12.98 cents per barrel.
   Among refined products, the December contract for heating oil
gained 0.71 cent to 43.47 cents per gallon, while the December
contract for unleaded gasoline lost 1.33 cents to 44.32.
   Traders attributed the drop in gasoline prices to the end of a
10-day-old refinery strike in Brazil.
   OPEC ministers adjourned their formal talks after 90 minutes
Monday to continue private negotiations among key members who are
trying to work out a lengthy dispute between Iran and Iraq.
   One of the main obstacles to a new agreement among the 13 members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been Iraq's
insistence on a production ceiling equal to Iran's.
   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman opened the cartel's winter meeting
by appealing for compromise. He said members must reach a new accord
limiting their oil production or risk a ``serious erosion'' of crude
prices.
   Analysts said they expected market trading to be light in advance
of clearer signals from the ongoing talks.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in the government's latest auction to the highest
level in 3{ years.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.97 percent on Monday, up from 7.82
percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.99 percent, up from 7.87 percent
last week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 8.04
percent on April 15, 1985 and six-month bills averaged 8.11 on April
29, 1985.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.24 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,800.80 and and 8.44 percent for six-month bills selling for
$9,598.30.
   In a separate report Monday, the Federal Reserve said the average
yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable rate home mortgages, rose to 8.55 percent last
week after averaging 8.35 percent the week before.

<HEAD>Prospect of More Bids, Kohlberg Kravis Indicates It's Staying in
the Fight</HEAD>

   Prospects of a fatter price tag emerging in the
record takeover struggle for RJR Nabisco Inc. have propelled the
company's stock higher, and one main contender has signaled its plan
to stay in the battle.
   RJR's stock surged Monday, one day after its directors prolonged
an unprecedented auction for the food-and-tobacco giant, reflecting
their belief that even the priciest proposal _ valued at $26.58
billion _ is too cheap.
   Separately, the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., a
key bidder for the company, indicated it would remain in contention
by extending its current tender offer for RJR Nabisco stock.
   To some securities analysts following the deal, the maneuvering
amounts to a spectacular guessing game in which it is difficult to
accurately value any of the bids or sense which direction the
biggest takeover saga ever would take next.
   ``This is not regular analysis; this is guessing,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, who follows RJR Nabisco for PaineWebber Group Inc. ``Who
knows what's going to happen. These are uncharted waters.''
   Part of the problem that the offers include securities that are
difficult to price, making it harder to value the entire package,
some analysts said.
   ``These are `cash and trash,' as they say,'' said John Maxwell,
who follows RJR Nabisco for the Richmond, Va. firm Wheat, First
Securities. ``You don't know how much the trash is worth until they
get it defined for you.''
   A special committee of RJR Nabisco directors had given
prospective bidders until last Friday to present proposals for
buying the company, maker of hundreds of consumer items ranging from
Winston cigarettes to Planter's peanuts and Oreo cookies.
   The directors received three bids and tried to evaluate them in a
marathon weekend number-crunching session, but on Sunday night
extended the auction until Nov. 29 to give bidders time to amend
their proposals and allow any new contenders to submit rival offers.
   That move reflected the directors' view that the unprecedented
auction process required more time and that possibly higher offers
could emerge.
   Wall Street speculators reacted by bidding RJR Nabisco stock up
$1.87{ a share to $85.87{ Monday in heavy New York Stock Exchange
trading, leaving the price nearly 54 percent higher than when the
takeover battle began last month.
   As of Monday these were the contenders:
   _Senior RJR Nabisco managers backed by the investment firms
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon Inc., offering a package of
cash and securities they valued at $100 a share, or $22.53 billion,
for the company's 225.3 million shares outstanding.
   _Kohlberg Kravis, backed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
Merrill Lynch & Co., offering a package of cash and securities they
valued at $94 a share, or $21.17 billion.
   _First Boston Corp. and Resource Holdings Inc., an investment
concern led by the Pritzker family of Chicago and Anschutz family of
Denver, saying they could offer a package of cash and securities
they valued at between $105 to $118 a share, or $23.65 billion to
$26.58 billion.
   Although the First Boston proposal looked the fattest, it was a
preliminary proposal that was vaguer than the others and structured
to take place over an extended period of time, rather than in a
single transaction that would provide shareholders immediate payment.
   Before last Friday, the management group had offered $92 a share
in cash and securities, or $20.7 billion. The Kohlberg Kravis group
had made a tender offer directly to shareholders of $90 a share in
cash and securities, or $20.3 billion.
   Kohlberg Kravis has argued its latest proposal was superior
because the firm can simply and easily amend its earlier tender
offer to reflect the higher $94-a-share price, speeding the payment
to stockholders by bypassing potentially time-consuming regulatory
obstacles that rival offers may face.
   Kohlberg Kravis on Monday extended the tender offer expiration
date from this Friday to Dec. 13, thereby keeping the structure of
that offer in place in case it wins the bidding contest.

   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. media empire is
adding The Disney Channel to the four Sky Television services that
it plans to bring to Britain and Ireland via satellite next year.
   The venture will be the first of several satellite-to-home
television services that are expected to compete in Britain over the
next few years.
   It gives Murdoch's Sky Television service the drawing power of a
well-known supplier of family-oriented programming, and gives Disney
a ready-made outlet in a new market as it expands globally,
including its planned 1992 opening of a European Disneyland near
Paris.
   Viewers with satellite dishes in Britain and Ireland will be able
to get three of the free Sky Television services, which are a sports
channel, a news channel and a general entertainment channel.
   Murdoch also planned to offer a pay movie channel, Sky Movies,
that viewers could get if they obtained a decoder and paid a monthly
fee.
   On Monday, Murdoch and Disney chairman Michael D. Eisner said
they had agreed to offer The Disney Channel, which carries
family-oriented programming and movies, as part of the package with
Sky Movies.
   Murdoch, chief executive officer of News Corp., and Eisner, who
is Disney's chief executive, refused to disclose how much they were
investing in the deal. They appeared at a New York news conference
that was broadcast via satellite to London.
   The Sky Movies programs are to be available in February, while
the Disney Channel is to begin broadcasting in May or June.
   Murdoch said he hoped 1 million satellite dishes would be in use
in Britain and Ireland within 18 months and said he expected the pay
service to become profitable within two to three years.
   The Disney Channel has about 4 million U.S. subscribers.
   Disney officials said the service for the Sky Movies audiences
would contain some programming from the U.S. service, plus other
material developed for the British and Irish markets.
   Eisner said Disney would benefit from News International's
knowledge of the British market and the steps it already took to
deliver programming.
   The five channels News International will be delivering to
Britain will be carried on the 16-channel Astra direct broadcast
satellite to be launched next month.
   Sky Movies will broadcast Disney's Touchstone films and News
Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox films, among others, along with
special event programming.
   The Disney Channel will operate 18 hours a day with children's
programming in the day, family entertainment in the early evening
and mainstream programs in the evening.
   On another topic, Murdoch said News Corp. was considering ways to
raise the $1 billion to pay for its $3 billion acquisition of
Triangle Publications Inc., which publishes TV Guide.
   ``We don't have anything on the block at the moment, but we are
considering various things,'' he said.
   He said the company was looking at ``some portfolio investments
we have talked about in Australia and Britain'' but is ``not
planning to sell any major assets.''

<BYLINE>Triangle Buyout Would Make French Company World's Biggest Packaging
Maker</BYLINE>

   The state-owned French conglomerate Pechiney SA
will be the world's largest consumer packaging maker following its
$1.26 billion acquisition of Triangle Industries Inc.
   But at least one industry analyst speculates the Paris company
may have to sell off some of Triangle's assets to offset the huge
debt load it will inherit from the company.
   Triangle said Monday that it accepted an unsolicited offer from
Pechiney that will allow top management to buy back Triangle's
non-packaging operations for $225 million. The $56-a-share deal
still needs regulatory approval.
   Triangle stock soared $35.78{ a share to close at $46.25 in the
over-the-counter market Monday.
   Triangle Chairman Nelson Peltz and President Peter W. May control
63 percent of the company's stock, and have 89 percent of the total
voting power. Before the company was taken semi-private last summer,
Triangle stock had been trading as high as $45 a share, said Timothy
Burns, an analyst with Prescott, Ball & Turbin Inc. of Cleveland.
   For Peltz and May, the cash deal provides a capital windfall
while allowing them to concentrate on Triangle operations outside of
container and packaging manufacture, which include the production of
juke boxes and vending machines and wire and cable.
   The acquisition would greatly strengthen Pechiney's presence in
the consumer containers and packaging business, making it by far the
largest in the world, as it prepares for the unification of the
Western European market in 1992.
   Pechiney is a diversified industrial group with operations such
as metals production, packaging and aerospace equipment.
   In a statement, Pechiney Chairman Jean Gandois said the company
planned no major changes in management and strategic operations at
Triangle's American National Can.
   ``Together, we will have the depth of resources, leading-edge
technology, global distribution network and worldwide market
presence necessary to compete successfully in today's rapidly
changing and increasingly demanding marketplace,'' Gandois said.
   Under the definitive agreement, Pechiney would pay $56 cash for
each of Triangle's common shares and $101.02 cash a share for the
company's $2 preferred stock, which is convertible to 1.82 common
shares.
   Triangle's 15} percent preferred stock would be redeemed at
$10.62{ a share plus accrued dividends.
   Both companies valued the agreement at $1.26 billion, but the
price actually is higher when Triangle's debt is included. Pechiney
essentially agreed to assume Triangle's outstanding debt, which
includes $2.6 billion in long-term securities.
   Burns speculated that Pechiney may have to sell some of
Triangle's assets, such as its glass or plastics operations, to
reduce that debt.
   Triangle accummulated its huge debt load over the years through
several acquisitions that have turned the company into the world's
biggest consumer packaging and container concern.
   Triangle acquired National Can Corp. in 1985 and American Can
Co.'s packaging business a year later, all primarily financed
through high-yield, low-rated junk bonds underwritten by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Triangle manufactures metal, glass and plastic containers and
packing products through its American National Can operations.
   The company had been looking for ways to expand, and about a year
ago even considered making an offer for Pechiney's packaging
operations.
   ``We first became acquainted with Pechiney management in 1987,
when we approached them about buying their packaging business, Cebal
Group,'' Peltz said in a statement. ``We did not pursue that
transaction. However, Pechiney approached us recently with their own
proposal for a business combination of Pechiney and Triangle.
   ``The current proposal will enable ANC (American National Can) to
fulfill that objective by providing it greater capacity to grow
internationally.''
   Triangle's other interests include Rowe International Inc., which
manufactures vending machines and juke boxes; Brandt Inc., a
manufacturer of automated coin sorters and counters; and Triangle
PWC, a producer of wire and cable.
   Triangle spokesman John W. Sullivan said that in addition to
those operations, Peltz and May would acquire the company's New York
headquarters and Florida offices.
