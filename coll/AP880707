   A three-story department store crowded
with people seeking shelter from torrential rains collapsed
Thursday, killing at least eight people, injuring more than 40 and
trapping others in the rubble, authorities said.
   ``It looks real bad,'' Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said of
the scene in the downtown area of this city across the Rio Grande
from Matamoros, Mexico. ``It's a disaster. It was just like a bomb
hit that corner store there.''
   The roof and front wall of La Tienda Amigo, known as the Amigo
Store, caved in at about 2:20 p.m. CDT. Emergency crews using
portable lights continued into the night digging through mounds of
broken cinderblocks, glass, twisted steel and merchandise to pull
out survivors and look for victims.
   ``They thought they heard some voices and that's where they're
digging now,'' city spokeswoman Pam Downing said about 10 p.m.
   Rescuers cut through a wall inside a Woolworth's store next door
to reach some of those trapped. Witnesses said they heard screams
from the wreckage. Linens and clothing blown from the store by high
winds were being used to wrap the wounds of the injured.
   Police Sgt. Dean Poos said shortly after 7 p.m. that ``we don't
really think there are going to be any more live people coming out
of there.''
   Ambulances and rescue personnel were hampered in reaching the
scene by floodwaters from the downpour. Steve Fitzgibbons, acting
assistant city manager, said some local businesses had volunteered
front-end loaders and cranes to help.
   The National Weather Service said the collapse could have been
caused by the weight of the rainwater, which dumped more than 2
inches in less than 30 minutes.
   The store was half a block from the international bridge, and
sheriff's Lt. Johnny Castillo said that when the storm began, a
large number of Mexican nationals ``were running there to get out
of the rain. The store was packed.''
   Poos said store owner Bernard Levine told him that when the roof
collapsed, ``he jumped under a table, and all he knows is that when
everything settled, he looked up and there was blue sky above him.''
   Levine said he escaped with three employees and three customers.
   Poos said six bodies had been removed from the rubble and
identified, and Johnny Economedes, head of one rescue team, said
workers had found two more bodies.
   ``They've got two steel beams across them and about 20 or 30
tons of concrete'' on them, Economedes said.
   Poos said eight people were admitted to hospitals and another 34
were treated at three hospitals in Brownsville and nearby San
Benito.
   Authorities said they could only guess at the number of people
who might have been trapped inside. Poos estimated it would be no
more than 50 and Castillo speculated it could be as many as 125.
   Poos said the dead included a woman who was apparently crushed
as she sat in a car with Mexican license plates in front of the
building. Two others were killed as they stood under a canopy in
front of the store.
   ``All of a sudden, I hear a noise kind of like a boom and I was
looking directly at the store and I see this tan-colored,
sandy-colored wall that filled the whole front of the store,'' said
Anthony Padilla, a Brownsville Herald photographer who was shooting
weather photos in front of the store when the roof collapsed.
   ``It was coming forward, then the windows, the entire
storefront, the windows just exploded out,'' he said. ``Glass just
went out. People just went like this, covered their heads, kind of
ducked down, and in the next instant, the whole thing just came
down.
   ``The people I had been looking at were just covered with
rubble,'' he said, adding one woman's hand was pinned to a parking
meter after a steel I-beam collapsed and left her surrounded with
cinder blocks.
   U.S. Border Patrol officials and other law enforcement agencies,
including Mexican authorities, assisted in the rescue operation.
   An emergency treatment center was set up at a civic center about
two blocks away and authorities blocked off the area.
   A meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Antonio
who asked not to be identified said that in the kind of storm that
hit the area, ``the drops are very large and very heavy, and the
fact that the storm system wasn't moving very fast _ only about 10
miles an hour _ can cause heavy flooding.''

   A federal official warned Thursday that two more months of
drought could close plants along three rivers in Alabama, Florida
and Georgia, as temperature records continued to fall, and circus
elephants were taken to a river to cool off in 101-degree
Pittsburgh.
   One official in drought-stricken Ohio warned Thursday of likely
statewide water restrictions. Low water again kept barges from
moving on the lower Mississippi River and part of the Ohio was
closed.
   An official of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources
said the river dipped closer Wednesday to a level that would
trigger a recommendation to divert water from lakes in northern
Minnesota.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, upon returning from Washington
Thursday night, said he persuaded U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Richard Lyng to allow farmers to donate their hay on Conservation
Reserve Program land without forfeiting any of their payment's
under it.
   ``This is a very critical time for livestock and dairy farmers.
These people are on the verge of bankruptcy,'' Perpich said at the
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. ``But it won't work
unless we get the farmers to donate the hay and the private and
commercial truckers to donate the transportation. I'll contribute
my time and drive one of those trucks.''
   Private crop analyst Conrad Leslie of the Leslie Analytical
Organization in Chicago said corn yields from irrigated fields of
Nebraska and parts of Iowa could be good, but some other fields in
the Midwest already are ``beyond recovery.''
   ``This is a disaster under development,'' said Leslie. ``We're
in uncharted waters. The great difficulty is that we don't know
what the moisture situation will be a year from now and whether we
can make a recovery.''
   Rain fell on some dry sections of Minnesota, but Pennsylvania
officials declared a statewide drought watch Thursday, triggering
voluntary reductions in water use and a ban on open fires in state
parks and forests.
   Temperatures hit record highs for the date Thursday in at least
28 cities from the Great Lakes to the East Coast, including 102 at
Fort Wayne, Ind., the National Weather Service said.
   Detroit's high of 100 degrees toppled a record that had been on
the books since 1874, when thermometers reached 97. In the normally
cool mountains of West Virginia, Elkins hit a record 93, the ninth
record temperature there since June 1.
   The temperature at Pittsburgh hit a record 101 degrees and four
elephants from the Syria Temple Shrine Circus were taken to the
Allegheny River for a cooling wallow. Only one of the animals,
natives of hot climates, got in and rolled around in the water.
   The drought also knocked the steam out of the annual railroad
journey transporting vintage, restored circus wagons to Milwaukee
for the city's Circus Parade.
   Officials said Thursday that the steam locomotive used to pull
the train won't make the run this year because of the danger of
setting track-side fires from sparks.
   Salt concentrations in Mississippi River water climbed higher
Thursday at drinking water intakes of the nearest downriver suburb
of New Orleans, and officials of St. Bernard Parish began reserving
barges to float in fresh water. The river's reduced flow is not
strong enough to push the dense salt water back into the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Lower Plaquemines Parish is already bringing fresh water by
barge to mix with the salty flow at its intakes 30 miles downriver
from New Orleans. The salt concentration there is already strong
enough to taste.
   A continuation of the drought for two more months could threaten
municipal water supplies and close plants along three major rivers
in Alabama, Florida and Georgia, Lt. Col. Garry Cooper of the Army
Corps of Engineers said Thursday.
   Cooper, deputy district engineer for the Corps' Mobile District,
addressed a drought management meeting of the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Drought Management Committee, made
up of the Corps, the three states and other organizations. The
committee announced that navigation on Florida's Apalachicola River
would virtually end on July 13 because of low water.
   Cooper referred to both plants that use water to run turbines
and generate electricity and those that use water for industrial
purposes, such as rinsing textiles and cooling machinery. The lack
of rain already has forced Alabama Power to shut down nearly all
hydroelectric production and have coal-burning plants make up the
difference.
   The Mississippi River remained closed at Black Hills, Miss.,
about 20 miles south of Natchez, Miss., where water had been as low
as five feet.
   ``Hopefully by this weekend we will have the river open if
somebody doesn't mess up,'' L.C. Fumbanks, chief of navigation for
the Army Corps of Engineers, said in a radio-telephone interview
from aboard the dredge Jadwin.
   The Jadwin worked south of Greenville, Miss., where traffic
resumed Wednesday, while another dredge pumped sand from the
blockage at Black Hills.
   The Coast Guard decided Thursday to close the Ohio River at
Mound City, Ill., for 12-hour shifts to clear a build-up of sand
and silt from the channel, said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Jim Clifton.
   He said the affected two-mile stretch would be opened for six
hours Friday morning, closed for 12 hours, then reopened for six
hours. ``It will just alternate back and forth like that until they
get it cleared through,'' Clifton said, adding that he had no
estimate how long that would take.
   Traffic on the Missouri River is normal, although barges are
carrying lighter loads, thanks to reservoirs upstream, said Paul
Johnston, director of public affairs for the Army Corps of
Engineers at Omaha, Neb.
   Ohio Lt. Gov. Paul Leonard said Thursday that voluntary water
conservation measures are not working.
   ``Most of the cities we're checking with regularly indicate the
program is not paying dividends,'' Leonard said in Dayton. ``My
guess is that if the drought continues for another two weeks to 30
days, we're going to need (statewide) mandatory water
restrictions.''
   Leonard made his remarks before leaving for Washington, where
he, like Perpich and officials from seven states met with Lyng.
   Richard Shank, director of Ohio's Environmental Protection
Agency, has asked the state's 2,500 largest water systems to aim
for a a minimum 25 percent reduction in water use by all customers,
and some cities have already banned lawn sprinkling.
   Georgia's Department of Natural Resources fined Gwinnett and
Cobb counties $75,000 each Wednesday for taking too much water in
June and told them they must cut consumption, possibly including
round-the-clock bans on outdoor water use.
   Up to 1.5 inches of rain fell on parts of west-central and
northern Minnesota late Wednesday and early Thursday, somewhat
easing drought conditions, the National Weather Service said today.
   ``Every little bit helps,'' said Clay County extension agent
Eddie Bernhardson. However, he added: ``the rain's been really
limited in most areas of the county, and high temperatures are
complicating'' the situation.
   Wheat, Clay County's biggest crop, ``is getting to the point
where in some areas they'll get 8 to 10 bushels an acre maximum''
compared to a normal average of 40 to 50 bushels, he said.
   Approximately 545 bales of hay from Elon College, N.C., arrived
Thursday at Shelbyville, Ky. It was a ``gesture of thanks'' for the
2,300 tons of hay Kentucky farmers sent by train to North Carolina
two years ago, said Roger Nesbitt, a spokesman for the Kentucky
Department of Agriculture.
   ``I gave about 50 bales two years ago. Now it's my turn to
receive,'' said O.L. Jeffries, who farms near Shelbyville. ``I
don't know which way to turn. It's pitiful.''

   Rescuers on Thursday night found two
more survivors of an explosion and towering fire that consumed the
Piper Alpha platform and killed up to 166 people in the world's
worst oil rig disaster.
   The search was suspended for the night, to resume at daylight
Friday. But authorities said there was little hope of finding
anyone else alive in the North Sea's frigid waters.
   The Piper Alpha oil rig, 120 miles off Scotland, is owned by
Occidental Petroleum.
   A joint statement issued by Occidental Petroleum spokesman David
Mathys in London and police in Aberdeen at 4:15 a.m. Friday (11:15
p.m. EDT Thursday) said:
   ``In all, 230 personnel were involved in the incident. This was
made up of 227 on Occidental facilities and three in a small rescue
boat. Seventeen bodies have been recovered. Total survivors to date
are 64, and 149 are unaccounted for.''
   Those numbers tooks into account body recovered early Friday.
Mathys said initial confusion as to the number of survivors
resulted in earlier discrepancies in the figures.
   Asked whether rescuers had given up hope of finding more
survivors, British Energy Department minister Peter Morrison said:
``To be honest, yes. At this stage there is very little hope
indeed.''
   The rig owners said the probable cause of the conflagration was
a gas leak, which a survivor said was ``screaming like a banshee''
seconds before the blast Wednesday night.
   Survivors told of having to choose between trying to survive the
flames in hopes aid would come and plunging 150 feet into a blanket
of burning oil that covered water cold enough to kill.
   ``It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' said Roy
Carey, 45, who jumped.
   Rescue pilots described flames up to 400 feet high. The fire
still flickered nearly 24 hours later.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government promised ``a very,
very deep and far-reaching inquiry.'' Questions arose about safety
stadards in the high-risk industry, and opposition politicians
claimed safety was neglected.
   Occidental Petroleum said it believed a gas leak was to blame,
but days or weeks would be needed to determine what caused and
ignited it. Occidental said the three-quarters of the 649-foot-high
rig was destroyed.
   Derek Ellington, a 45-year-old rigger, said he was in a workshop
near the control center when he heard the scream of ``two gas leaks
almost simultaneously, and about 30 seconds later there was the
first explosion. It wiped out the control room and that was it. Our
nerve center was gone.''
   Andrew Sneddon, a university lecturer on offshore engineering in
Aberdeen, said: ``We can only assume there was a leak of some sort.
Basically, you are sitting on top of two highly flammable products
_ oil and gas. A leak or a spill is a potential hazard. It is
extremely difficult to say what could have set it off.''
   The number of men still missing and the dim prospects for
finding them alive seem certain to make the Piper Alpha explosion
the worst oil rig disaster, surpassing the 123 deaths when the
Alexander L. Kielland platform capsized in Norway's North Sea
waters in March 1980.
   Police said the overwhelming majority of those on the Piper
Alpha were Scottish, but the domestic British news agency Press
Association said workers from the United States, Canada,
continental Europe and South Africa also were aboard. Authorities
said no list of dead would be released until families were notified.
   Six NATO warships, led by the U.S. destroyer Hayler, diverted
from maneuvers to join a multinational flotilla of rescue vessels.
Helicopters criss-crossed the smoke-filled skies.
   Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental, said he would leave
immediately for Aberdeen to oversee care the care of injured
workers and families of the missing, said spokesman Roger Gillot at
the company's Los Angeles headquarters.
   Survivors were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and officials
said 20 were hospitalized, most with burns. Distraught families
clustered outside waiting for news of loved ones.
   Parkinson insisted safety standards were strict, including
week-long government inspections annually. He said the Piper Alpha
inspection took place two weeks ago.
   John Prescott of the opposition Labor Party claimed in
Parliament that rig inspection and maintenance had been reduced in
recent years, too little money was spent on training, and health
and safety legislation did not apply fully to the North Sea oil and
gas industry.
   In reply, Parkinson said serious North Sea accidents had fallen
from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year. He added: ``That is too high a
figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure that
improvement is maintained.''
   Bob Cryer of Labor said an explosion on the Piper Alpha four
years ago slightly injured four men, and claimed the investigators'
report was kept secret. Parkinson's department said the report was
not published because investigators found no negligence and did not
recommend prosecutions.
   The disaster Wednesday night began at about 9.30 p.m., just
after a 12-hour shift had ended, and many of the men were in bed.
   ``I was just going to bed and there was a bang,'' said Dave
Lambert, 38. ``They came in and said there was a fire and to get
out. The sprinklers were on. We could see them, but there wasn't
sufficient volume to put down the fire.''
   Rigger Tony Sinnett, watching from a supply vessel, told the
Aberdeen Evening Express: ``It was like the platform had been hit
by an atomic bomb. There was massive mushrooms and flames shooting
into the air. I just thanked God I wasn't on board.''

<TEXT>
   West Germans may be the world's
greatest beer lovers, but now they're tops in fruit juice
consumption, too.
   According to the Bonn-based Association of German Fruit Juice
Industries, West Germans drank 33.5 quarts of fruit juice per
capita in 1987. This represents an 11-percent increase over 1986
and is the highest worldwide.
   In second place in national juice consumption is neighboring
Switzerland. In 1987, the average Swiss drank 29.6 quarts. Fruit
juice drinking in the United States was given as 27.6 quarts per
capita.
   The West German fruit juice industry had around $1.65 billion in
sales last year, the association reported.

   Senators are weighing in with their favorite
candidates for attorney general, while the man who's leaving the
job predicts his successor will not be ``a clone of anybody else.''
   President Reagan launched his search Wednesday for Edwin Meese
III's replacement and one of his first steps in the process was to
meet with the departing attorney general.
   A lightning rod of controversy because of his conservative
policies and his personal legal problems, Meese announced Tuesday
he would be gone in a few weeks. He declared himself vindicated by
an 830-page report on his official conduct compiled by independent
counsel James McKay, although he acknowledged he had not yet seen
it.
   The report has not been released by a special federal court.
While sources have said the report recommends against a criminal
indictment, its conclusions on Meese's ethical conduct remain
unclear.
   While no names of possible successors were volunteered at the
White House, senators made sure that a steady list of possibilities
kept drifting from Capitol Hill to the White House.
   Some lawmakers made telephone calls to administration officials.
Others allowed their message to be carried by news reporters. All
agreed that the window for confirmation would be short.
   Majority Democrats control the Senate schedule. Recesses already
are scheduled during the two national political conventions in July
and August, and Congress might adjourn early during the
presidential campaign.
   Two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, ranking
Republican Strom Thurmond and Democrat Dennis DeConcini, suggested
former Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada as Meese's successor.
Laxalt was considered the president's closest Senate ally before
retiring.
   Tom Loranger, a spokesman for Laxalt, quoted the former senator
as saying, ``There is absolutely no truth to the rumors about my
going to the Justice Department.'''
   Laxalt's secretary at his Washington law office, Janene Assuras,
said her boss was ``not interested'' in the job, but didn't know
what he would do if Reagan asked.
   DeConcini, of Arizona, also recommended former House Republican
leader John Rhodes from his home state.
   Thurmond, of South Carolina, also had other suggestions: former
Democratic Attorney General Griffin B. Bell, who served under Jimmy
Carter; and Reagan's first attorney general, William French Smith.
   Responding to a reporter's question, Thurmond said former
Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole ``would make an excellent
attorney general.''
   Her husband, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., suggested
that former White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr. and
Washington lawyer Judith Richards Hope, daughter-in-law of comedian
Bob Hope, would qualify.
   Baker resigned as chief of staff, effective June 30, to return
to private law practice in Tennessee. Mrs. Hope's nomination to
succeed Robert H. Bork on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia has not yet been acted upon by the Senate.
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah and a Judiciary Committee member,
favors acting Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen, of Salt
Lake City. A newcomer to the department, Christensen's confirmation
hearing for the deputy's job is set for July 27.
   Conservative Republican Sen. Steve Symms of Idaho rcommended
Eugene Thomas of Boise, president of the American Bar Association
in 1986-87.
   ``He doesn't have any scars and has an impeccable record,''
Symms said.
   Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, R-N.Y., suggested a homestate judge,
Sol Wachtler, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals. His
term on the state court expires in January 1999.
   Justice Department spokesman Patrick Korten said Wednesday that
he believed Meese has ``weighed in'' on the question of his
successor.
   Interviewed on Cable News Network, Meese was asked what kind of
person he thought should succeed him.
   ``I don't think anybody would be a clone of anybody else,'' he
said. But Meese said he hoped the person selected is ``someone who
subscribes to the principles of Ronald Reagan and his
administration.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater conceded that
administration officials had no contingency plan to find a
replacement, even though Meese indicated some time ago he might
leave before the end of the administration.
   ``We had an attorney general up until yesterday,'' Fitzwater
said. ``We don't compile lists for positions where they're already
filled.''
   Fitzwater had said earlier that Meese told Reagan ``some time
ago that he might want to leave before the end of the
administration. The president left the timing up to him.''
   Reagan ``briefly discussed'' a successor for Meese with White
House chief of staff Kenneth Duberstein and general counsel A.B.
Culvahouse, the spokesman said.
   If a new attorney general has not been confirmed by the time
Meese leaves, Fitzwater said, the administration probably would
install Solicitor General Charles Fried in the job on an acting
basis.

<HEAD>No Big Jump In Food Prices, Ag Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increases in food prices should remain
moderate this year despite the drought as the nation begins to draw
on its large grain reserves, says the Agriculture Department's top
economist.
   ``The immediate problem is not one of food shortage or food
price inflation, except in certain specific instances, but rather
the problem is one of responding in a compassionate way to the
losses faced by American farmers,'' Assistant Secretary of
Agriculture Ewen M. Wilson said Wednesday.
   Appearing before three House subcommittees, Wilson forecast
tight supplies of soybeans and oats. He also acknowledged that
while the winter wheat harvest is actually ahead of schedule, there
has been severe damage to spring wheat and much of the corn crop is
in bad shape.
   He said, however, that South American soybeans will be available
to meet U.S. needs and added that reserves of wheat and feed grains
are ample to ensure that Americans will not have to endure any
calamitous food shortage.
   The testimony came as Capitol Hill began to focus more intently
on food prices, with lawmakers saying there was no immediate reason
to warrant major increases.
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., called on the congressional General
Accounting Office to monitor food prices in the next six months. He
expressed concern that food processors and others might engage in
``price gouging.''
   ``It simply wouldn't wash with economic reality to cite the
drought as a reason for a quick runup of food prices,'' he said in
a statement. ``It would be inexcusable for any company to use the
drought as a way to make a quick buck.''
   Wilson did say that prolonged drought would send wheat prices
higher, guaranteeing ``some additional pressure on retail prices of
bakery products and cereals'' but not a major increase.
   He said, however, that farm-level prices account for only 8
percent of the retail value of cereal and bakery products.
   ``If wheat prices for the entire season average 30 percent above
last year, this alone would translate into a 2.4 percent rise in
the retail price of bakery and cereal products,'' Wilson said. He
said any increases would be ``moderate'' in scale.
   Wilson said that while no major shortages were in sight, there
could be a squeeze in the supply of some crops.
   He also said grazing conditions on June 1 were rated 68 percent
of ideal and that hay prices are up 22 percent from last year.
   But 65 percent of the winter wheat crop, which amounts to
three-quarters of all U.S. wheat production, already has been
harvested and progress is ``well ahead of normal,'' Wilson said.
   In contrast, ``the spring wheat crop is in bad shape with almost
two-thirds of the crop rated in poor to very poor condition due to
the drought,'' he said.
   Wheat reserves at the start of the year totaled 1.27 billion
bushels, well above the average of the last decade, Wilson said. He
said that amount plus winter wheat already in the bins from the
current harvest add up to a 10-month supply. That includes wheat
for export, he said.
   The greatest production loss is in durum wheat, which is used
for pasta, he said. The condition of hard red spring wheat also is
generally poor, but stocks equal to 80 percent of annual use are
available, he said.
   Turning to feed grains, he said, corn is generally in fair
condition. In 10 of the 17 major producing states, 25 percent or
more of the crop is rated poor or very poor, he said.
   In six of the 11 major sorghum-producing states, at least 25
percent of sorghum acreage is rated poor or very poor, he said.
   There are no weekly reports on the condition of oats and barley,
Wilson said. But he noted that more than half the nation's barley
and one-third of its oats come from the Grain Belt where the
drought is worst.
   Nonetheless, corn stocks on hand as of Sept. 1 are projected to
equal 50 percent of annual use and sorghum stocks 90 percent of
annual use. Wilson said corn supply should be ample to prevent any
serious shortage.
   ``Even with a very pessimistic scenario you end up with a
carryover of a billion bushels,'' he said.
   Wilson said the soybean crop is generally rated fair to poor. In
11 of the 19 major producing states, ``anywhere from one-fourth to
more than one-half of the crop is rated poor or worse,'' he said.

   Jesse Jackson is calling for a period of
mourning for the victims of the U.S. missile attack on an Iranian
jetliner, and urging the United States to pay reparations to the
victims' families.
   He also criticized Vice President George Bush for statements the
likely Republican nominee made this week in response to the deaths
of 290 people in the downing of the Iranian commercial jet.
   ``I thought it was a bit in bad taste, if not downright vulgar,
to be running around on July 4, getting applause lines, talking
about the honor of the Navy, as if it were in question, and not
expressing the profound sense of humanity that the American people
have and our sense of sharing the grief of the tragedy,'' Jackson
said at the United Nations.
   Bush expressed his deep regrets on Monday as he campaigned
through the Midwest, saying, ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great
national holiday our hearts go out to the loved ones and families
of those who were lost and also (hearts) go out to those kids,
those young Americans who are defending freedom halfway around the
world.''
   However, Bush also said he could identify with the captain of
the Navy cruiser, who made the decision to fire because he believed
his ship was in danger. And Bush said he did not believe U.S.
policy in the region would change as a result of the incident.
   ``Life goes on,' the vice president said.
   Jackson, who met with Arab leaders at the United Nations,
emphasized that the downing of the Iranian plane was ``an accident,
an error ... No one assumes that the Navy is without compassion,
that it moved to engage in an act of war.''
   ``We should say to Iran that we sincerely regret the accident
occurred, that we offer reparations or compensation to the families
of the victims, if they will accept them,'' said Jackson, repeating
a call he made over the holiday weekend in the wake of the incident.
   At the U.N., Jackson met with envoys of the Arab League,
including Iraq, Djibouti, Mauritania, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, Syria,
Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Democratic Yemen, Algeria, Morocco,
Lebanon and Qatar.
   He repeated his plea for the release of U.S. hostages and all
other captives in Lebanon.
   Jackson also said he favored a new international naval
peacekeeping force in the gulf. ``I hope the United Nations will
hav a much more prominent rule in the gulf in the future,'' Jackson
said.
   Earlier, when asked if he had any interest in becoming U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations, Jackson replied, ``None
whatsoever.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Faces Deficit and Confidence Problems at Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who has been highly
critical of the Reagan adminsitration's deficit spending in his
Democratic presidential campaign, has a deficit problem of his own.
   Two weeks before his certain selection as the Democratic
presidential nominee, the Massachusetts governor faces a $450
million deficit on an $11 billion budget in the just-ended fiscal
year and has yet to sign a budget for the new one.
   And according to a new poll, the Massachusetts governor's
favorability rating is declining _ although residents of his home
state still heavily favor him over Republican George Bush.
   Dukakis aides insist that the budget problems will be resolved
in short order and that the governor's home-state popularity will
rebound.
   But the Bush campaign is already making the fiscal woes into a
campaign issue.
   ``It could turn out to be the Achilles heel of the Dukakis
presidential campaign,'' said state Sen. Paul Cellucci, a
Massachusetts coordinator for the Bush campaign.
   The state government's new fiscal year began last Friday, and
Dukakis has yet to close a $450 million deficit for last year and
still must shepherd a 1989 budget to his desk. Faced with an
unexpected revenue shortfall, the governor is scaling back his
spending plans and pushing for a package of narrowly targeted tax
and fee increases.
   On Wednesday, Dukakis was forced to ask the Legislature for $81
million in emergency spending authority to avoid having to renege
on the state payroll and welfare checks. The House approved the
measure.
   ``The putting together of budgets is not a pleasant process to
watch _ never has been, never will be,'' said John DeVillars, the
governor's deputy chief secretary. ``There is obviously a great
deal more attention to the process this year, in part because of
unanticipated events that have led to less revenue than expected
and in part because the chief executive is running for national
office.''
   According to a telephone survey last week of 400 likely
Massachusetts voters, 56 percent said Dukakis has not been an
effective governor while campaigning for president and 47 percent
said he should resign now or immediately after the Democratic
convention July 18-21.
   In addition, the governor's unfavorable rating has more than
doubled _ to 36 percent _ since a similar poll in January 1987,
before Dukakis declared his intention to run. His favorable rating
dropped from 71 percent to 55 percent.
   Still, the survey said Dukakis was favored over Bush, 51 percent
to 37 percent. The poll was conducted for WBZ-TV and The Boston
Herald by KRC Communications.
   DeVillars said Dukakis has devoted well over 100 hours in recent
weeks to the state's budget problems while at the same time
focusing on the selection of a vice presidential running mate. But
he has not dominated the budget process as he has in past years.
   Based on June tax collections, the government is technically
about $450 million in deficit for fiscal 1988, according to
legislative leaders. Dukakis has offered a 20-point program to
close that gap through bookkeeping changes and borrowing, but the
state House has balked at several unpopular features.
   Dukakis and his legislative allies argue that the deficit was
the unforseeable result of a downturn in income tax receipts
combined with $92 million in court-ordered corporate tax abatements.
   At the same time, Dukakis has been forced to retreat from the
$12 billion spending goal for fiscal 1989 that he announced in
January, and he has agreed with top Democratic lawmakers to reduce
the spending target.
   A conference committee negotiated a compromise late Wednesday of
$11.75 billion, which Dukakis is expected to sign next week.
   A principal sticking point has been nervousness about revenues
for the coming year. After five years of double-digit revenue
growth, tax collections fell nearly flat last year. Nevertheless,
the administration projects a comeback in fiscal 1989 of 12
percent, a figure that many legislators question.
   In order to buttress revenues, Dukakis has turned to taxes. He
recently signed a $40 million tax on cigarettes, and more than $200
million in other new taxes are moving toward his desk.
   One would raise personal taxes on the wealthy by bringing the
state code back into conformance with federal law, another would
end a corporate loophole that allows multistate companies to write
off their out-of-state losses, and a third would capture some $24
million a year in unclaimed bottle deposits that now stay in the
hands of bottlers.
   Cellucci blames Dukakis for over-spending during his second term.
   ``You can't have budgets that rise at twice the rate of
inflation and add 10,000 new state employees and not have a day of
reckoning. This is the day of reckoning that they're trying to
postpone until after November.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's pollster says Ohio Sen.
John Glenn is ``far and away'' the strongest choice for the
Democratic vice presidential nomination.
   Richard Wirthlin, more accustomed to giving advice to
Republicans than to Democrat Michael Dukakis, told reporters at a
luncheon Wednesday that Glenn would help Dukakis ``play the
patriotic theme'' in the general election campaign.
   He contended the question of the Republican vice presidential
choice was less clear for Vice President George Bush.
   Among the prospects he cited were Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and
his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, as well
as Gov. Jim Thompson of Illinois and former Gov. Richard Thornburgh
of Pennsylvania.
   Wirthlin, who has done polling for Reagan for more than 20
years, worked for Dole during the Kansas senator's unsuccessful bid
for the 1988 GOP presidential nomination.
   He said he thought Dole would help Bush in the Midwest farm belt
and among blue collar workers. But he conceded that Dole's acerbic
personality could be damaging if he went on the attack.
   Wirthlin also said he thought it would be a mistake to have
President Reagan on the stump attacking Dukakis.
   ``People do not approve of an incumbent president attacking a
candidate trying to succeed him,'' he said.
   In addition, he said, Reagan ``is not a good attack candidate.''
   Wirthlin also said the resignation of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III doesn't erase the ``sleaze factor'' for Bush in the fall
presidential campaign, but makes it easier for him to deal with it.
   During a luncheon session with reporters, Wirthlin said only
about 3 percent of the voters he has surveyed cite ethics in
government as the most important issue, a figure that is no higher
than a year earlier.
   The issue that outstrips all others in importance in the minds
of voters is drugs, said the pollster.
   ``There are now 21 percent who tag drugs as the single most
important problem facing the nation,'' he said. No other issue was
named by more than 10 percent of people interviewed.
   While Meese was under investigation by independent counsel James
McKay, Bush was peppered with questions about whether he thought
the attorney general should resign. Bush aides at one point
described Meese as a ``liability,'' a description the vice
president disavowed.
   Wirthlin said the departure of Meese would put the ethics issue
``in a different context'' and would ``enable Bush to talk about
ethics without implicitly criticizing Ed Meese.''

<TEXT>
   When the Democratic National Convention opens
here this month, protesters from animal rights activists to AIDS
victims will be on hand to try to grab a bit of the spotlight.
   But convention organizers, who carefully orchestrate many of the
events inside the convention hall, are also seeking to bring order
to what could otherwise be a chaotic crush of demonstrations.
   The city is supplying a stage across the street from the
convention site that will serve as a soapbox for a variety of
causes. Protesters are being offered two-hour time slots over five
days to air their views.
   The city will provide a stage and sound equipment in the lot,
which authorities estimate can hold about 30,000 people.
   The demonstrators will be within sight and earshot of the
delegates as they arrive and depart during the gathering July 15-18.
   However, the plan is being challenged in federal court by a
coalition of groups seeking expanded space for demonstrations. A
decision was possible as early as today.
   Generally, potentially antagonistic groups have not been
scheduled together, although a gay rights group follows a white
supremacist organization onto the stage one afternoon.
   By Wednesday, 25 of the 40 slots were filled, four of them by
one organization, the Committee for Fair Elections. At least four
other groups with ties to that committee also have reserved time.
   The group is the vehicle for the independent presidential
campaign of Leonora B. Fulani, who says she will bring 10,000
backers to the convention. She has qualified for the ballot in all
50 states and is eligible for federal matching funds.
   Demonstrations coinciding with those on the stage supplied by
the city will be permitted in the parking lot, but their organizers
cannot use powerful sound equipment.
   Local organizations with demonstration time include a
neighborhood group that opposes the construction of a domed stadium
in the neighborhood near the convention site.
   The Nationalist Movement, a Mississippi-based white supremacy
group, has been given a parade permit and a two-hour slot on Sunday
afternoon in conjunction with its annual convention.
   Other groups given protest time in the parking lot include:
   _ The Committee on Latin America, a liberal Washington-based
foreign policy lobby.
   _ No Business As Usual, which opposes the Strategic Defense
Initiative, known as Star Wars.
   _ Disabled In Action, a group advocating better access for the
handicapped, which has ties to the Fulani campaign.
   _ U.S.-Congo Friendship Committee, which opposes the regime of
President Mobuto Sese Seko of Zaire.
   _ Rep. Gus Savage, a Democratic congressman from Chicago.
   _ Castillo Cultural Centers, a New York City-based performing
arts group specializing in working-class history and progressive
politics.
   _ The People's Independent Democratic Club, a Bronx, N.Y.-based
pro-Fulani organization.
   _ People With AIDS Coalition and March on AIDS.
   _ Arts Pluribus Unum, an Atlanta artist and activist group
specializing in liberal political performances.
   _ Compassion Campaign `88, an animal rights organization.
   _ LEGAL, a national gay rights organization.
   _ Greater Lowell Environmental Campaign, a Massachusetts-based
group specializing in hazardous waste issues.
   _ Illinois Solidarity Party, a former splinter Democratic group
now run by Fulani backers.
   _ Prisoners of War@Missing in Action, which advocates further
investigation into cases of servicemen listed as missing from the
Vietnam war.
   _ The New Alliance Party, a national group that led the drive to
get Ms. Fulani's name on the ballot.

<HEAD>Dukakis Keeps Up Attack On Administration Ethics Despite Meese
Move</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis, resuming his criticism of Reagan
administration ethical standards, said the nation regained ``a
measure of self-respect'' through the resignation of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III.
   But he said Meese's departure does not change the
administration's record of ethical breaches.
   ``The way to clean up Washington is to clean out those people
who are indifferent to breaches of the public trust and the public
laws,'' the Democratic presidential nominee-to-be told a friendly
audience of Greek Americans on Wednesday.
   ``Yesterday we lost an attorney general, but we gained a measure
of self-respect,'' he said.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, was spending most of today
in his Statehouse office before heading West for three days of
campaigning. Awaiting his review was a proposed fiscal 1989 budget
compromise worked out Wednesday evening by legislators.
   Passage of that plan would help Dukakis at home, where budget
problems have prompted questions about his ability to govern while
seeking the White House. It would also make life easier for him on
the campaign trail, where he has used competent fiscal management
as a selling point.
   Dukakis ended his day Wednesday with a speech to the Greek
Orthodox Ecumenical Congress. The presumed Republican nominee, Vice
President George Bush, was to address the same group today.
   ``Next year, if all goes well, we're going to have a president
who will insist that those who accept the privilege of public
service must understand the meaning of public service,'' Dukakis
told the group. ``If someone in my administration is caught
breaking the law, we won't make excuses for him, we'll prosecute
him.''
   Before that appearance Dukakis met for more than an hour with 20
national civil rights leaders, including NAACP executive director
Benjamin Hooks, National Urban League President John Jacob, the
Rev. Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
and Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr.
   Several participants described the session as positive and more
substantive than a meeting the same group had recently with Bush.
   ``I cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on,'' Hooks said.
   Whether blacks will support Dukakis without Jesse Jackson on the
ticket is largely up to Jackson, Hooks said.
   ``I think that they basically will follow _ though some will be
disappointed _ will follow his leadership,'' he said.
   Dukakis began his day by meeting with Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton,
the eighth potential running mate to meet face-to-face with
Dukakis. One of them, Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, took himself out of
the running.
   After a 50-minute meeting with Dukakis at the Statehouse,
Hamilton fired back a quick ``yes'' when asked if he would accept
the vice presidential nomination.
   Hamilton said he had a ``very relaxed and wide-ranging
discussion'' with Dukakis, with the main topics being the vice
presidency and foreign policy.
   Others being considered for the No. 2 spot on the ticket are
Jackson, Sens. Albert Gore of Tennessee, John Glenn of Ohio, Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas and Bob Graham of Florida, and Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri.
   Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaign chairman, was in Washington
through Friday, gathering information on the contenders and talking
with party leaders.

<HEAD>Hugh Hefner's Former Girlfriend Alleges He Supplied Her With Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hugh Hefner's former girlfriend has accused
the Playboy founder and celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson
of supplying her with enough drugs to make her an addict.
   ``(Hefner) supplied me with almost every drug that I ever took
in that house. He had for about two years,'' Carrie Leigh, 24, told
the television show ``Entertainment Tonight'' in a two-part
interview beginning Wednesday.
   ``I was addicted to pills ... painkillers, sleeping pills,
Quaaludes and he had them under lock and key and he supplied me
with these pills every day,'' she said.
   Miss Leigh filed a $35 million palimony suit against Hefner
earlier this year, claiming he defrauded and deceived her by
allegedly abandoning promises to support her and father a child.
She later dropped the lawsuit.
   ``As the original palimony suit proved, Carrie Leigh had a very
vivid imagination, and whatever she says, should be viewed with a
certain amount of skepticism,'' Hefner said Wednesday.
   ``I spent the last three years of the relationship trying to
curb her abuse of both drugs and alcohol, and she very well knows
it,'' he said of their five-year relationship that ended earlier
this year. ``Please remember that I had a stroke in March 1985 that
dramatically changed the focus of my life. It ended my use of all
recreational drugs.''
   In Wednesday's segment, Miss Leigh accused Mitchelson, who
represented her in the palimony lawsuit, of also supplying drugs
and making a pass at her.
   ``At the time when I started the lawsuit, I was still addicted
to some pills and he supplied me with them,'' Miss Leigh said.
   Mitchelson, who handled divorces of such celebrities as Joan
Collins of ``Dynasty,'' is under investigation by the California
State Bar for alleged misconduct.
   ``I completely deny all of the allegations. I don't want to
attack Carrie Leigh,'' Mitchelson told the television program.
   ``She told me during the case I was a wonderful lawyer. For the
last 31 years, I've never heard any criticisms like these until
recently,'' he said. ``I've spent my life defending women, not
attacking them.''

<HEAD>Bush Pledges Hispanic Cabinet Member; Dukakis Finds Some Budget
Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis was finding some relief from a politically
embarrassing budget crisis in his home state as Vice President
George Bush pledged to right ``a wrong that has been out there for
many years'' and appoint a Hispanic American to his Cabinet.
   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, was spending most of today
in his Statehouse office before heading West for three days of
campaigning. He was preparing to review a proposed fiscal 1989
state budget compromise.
   Massachusetts House and Senate leaders agreed late Wednesday on
a compromise budget of $11.75 billion that would increase state
spending by about 4 percent.
   Dukakis was forced to seek emergency spending authority this
week to keep government functioning. Massachusetts faces a $450
million deficit on an $11 billion budget in the just-ended fiscal
year.
   Dukakis has been highly critical of the Reagan administration's
deficit spending, and Republicans are planning to make political
hay of his troubles.
   ``It could turn out to be the Achilles heel of the Dukakis
presidential campaign,'' said state Sen. Paul Cellucci, a
Massachusetts coordinator for the Bush campaign.
   Dukakis, for his part, continued to attack the ethical standards
of the Reagan administration, saying the resignation of Attorney
General Edwin Meese III does not erase the administration's shoddy
record.
   ``If someone in my administration is caught breaking the law, we
won't make excuses for him, we'll prosecute him,'' he told a
friendly audience of Greek Americans in Boston.
   Bush was traveling to Boston tonight to address the same ethnic
group at a Greek Orthodox diocesan dinner. Aides said Bush was
going to talk about the importance of religion.
   Dukakis was traveling to Dallas tonight to address a convention
of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the same group to
whom Bush promised Wednesday he would make a Hispanic appointment.
   Bush said after addressing LULAC, the largest and oldest
Hispanic American civic group, that he would not go around the
country making the same promise to other special interest groups.
   ``Other groups have been represented in the Cabinet and
Hispanics have not,'' said Bush.
   ``I will be very open-minded and broad-based in who I select to
serve in my Cabinet, but I'm addressing myself to righting a wrong
that has been out there for many years,'' he said.
   Oscar Moran, the group's president, said Bush ``attracted the
attention of some voters who already decided on Dukakis.''
   But Tony Bonilla, an influential Democrat in the group, said it
was ``a little patronizing'' for Bush to make such a statement
after serving eight years in the Reagan administration without a
Hispanic in the inner circle.
   Hispanics are a politically important group, especially in key
battleground states like Texas, California and Florida. Dukakis'
command of Spanish gives him an advantage in competing for votes
from those groups.
   Dukakis met for more than an hour Wednesday with 20 national
civil rights leaders, including NAACP executive director Benjamin
Hooks, National Urban League President John Jacob, the Rev. Joseph
Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Coretta
Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King Jr.
   ``I cannot recall an issue he disagreed with us on,'' Hooks
said. But whether blacks will support Dukakis without Jesse Jackson
on the ticket is largely up to Jackson, Hooks said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, met with Arab leaders at the United Nations.
Afterward he emphasized that the shooting down of an Iranian
passenger jet by a U.S. ship in the Persian Gulf was ``an accident,
an error.''
   Jackson called for a period of mourning for the victims of the
attack and urged the United States to pay reparations to the
victims' families.

   What do you do when the company you
founded is bought by foreigners for $310 million?
   If you're Mary Tyler Moore, you keep working. And you make some
charities very happy.
   Miss Moore said Wednesday the sale of MTM Entertainment Inc.,
the production company she co-founded, will free her to boost
contributions to the arts and to the fight against diabetes. A
diabetic, Miss Moore is international chairman of the Juvenile
Diabetes foundation.
   Just how much money does the 50-year-old actress get from the
sale of the company that bears her initials to Television South PLC
of Britain?
   ``Enough so I don't have to learn to type, after all,'' was all
she'd say.
   Sale or no, Miss Moore is set to appear in a new MTM series
slated to make its debut on CBS this fall, assuming the
scriptwriters strike is settled.
   The as-yet unnamed romantic comedy will feature Miss Moore as a
divorced mother working for a New York politician. In the series,
she marries a blue-collar worker from New Jersey with children of
his own.
   ``These children are going to be real children,'' she promised.
``They're not going to be cartoon characters. They're not going to
be little munchkins with quips.''

Rumproast, also affectionately known as ``Rumpy,'' wasn't one of
them.
   His estranged wife, Lia, said he could pack up three of the
couple's pooches, but said their Italian greyhound was staying put.
   ``I just wanted to have a little watchdog here,'' she said,
adding that she let her husband take the other dogs because he
can't sleep without them.
   Belli said it's not fair. He said that because of concern about
``Rumpy's tears on being separated'' from the rest of his canine
family, he'll take legal steps to get the dog back.
   ``All I want is that the dog be with the other dogs; the dogs
hate her (Lia),'' he said. ``I slept with those dogs for the past
five or six years when I kicked her out of my bed.''
   Lia Belli filed for a legal separation last week.

   Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's first dog, may
be headed for stardom in New York after finding himself at the
center of a feud between talk show host David Letterman and Josie
Orr, the wife of Gov. Robert D. Orr.
   The Orrs' Welsh Corgi may be offered an appearance on the
``Stupid Pet Tricks'' segment of ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' as part of settling the feud, which the
Indianapolis-born comedian has mentioned on the air, said Becky
Weiland, an aide to Mrs. Orr.
   Letterman also is expected to call Mrs. Orr during his program
tonight or Friday.
   The feud began with an encounter with Letterman during the
Indianapolis 500 on May 29, the governor said Tuesday.
   ``Josie told him that Oliver P. Morton can push a rock around
the floor with his nose. But Letterman wasn't interested,'' Orr
said. ``He ignored her. Then he made some remark about, `How did
she get in here?' or something like that. That's the reason she's
upset with him.''

   Actress Ava Gardner, who suffered a mild
stroke two years ago, is contemplating a return to the silver
screen, her attorney says.
   ``She's fit as a fiddle, feels strong, feels great and is
thinking about doing a picture,'' lawyer Paul Caruso said Wednesday.
   The 66-year-old actress has ``recovered tremendously'' from the
stroke in late 1986, for which she was hospitalized for two months,
Caruso said.
   He did not say what kind of role Miss Gardner was considering.
   Miss Gardner, who has lived in London for the past 20 years, was
the daughter of a poor North Carolina tenant farmer. She became a
leading lady in the 1940s and 1950s.
   She starred in 60 films, including ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro,''
``The Barefoot Contessa'' and ``The Killers.'' She most recently
was seen in the CBS-TV series ``Falcon Crest.''

   Princess Margaret, colonel-in-chief
of this city's Princess Louise Fusiliers, inspected her regiment
for the first time in three decades.
   The 57-year-old younger sister of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II
presented new colors, or regimental flags, to the regiment
Wednesday at the Garrison Grounds, a grassy field behind the
downtown Halifax Citadel, a historic British fortress.
   Margaret's eight-day tour of Canada was prompted by a request 18
months ago from the provincial capital's offical regiment for new
colors.
   The princess ended her second day in Canada with a private
reception at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.
   She is scheduled to leave Nova Scotia on Friday for Toronto,
where her tour ends July 12.

   Public television and cable channels are hoping
to lure away network viewers as the lengthy writers strike wears
on, delaying the fall season for the networks and the debut of new
series.
   ``I must say, I have mixed emotions (about the strike), because
I hate to think about all those writers out of work, so it's
nothing to jump up and down about. On the other hand, I think it
will help us quite a bit,'' said Suzanne Weil, senior vice
president of national programming and promotion services for the
Public Broadcasting Service.
   The strike, which began March 7, has forced the three major
television networks to delay the traditional fall season when they
launch new series. The guild rejected the most recent management
offer last month. It voted Wednesday night on a model contract for
independent producers. Results were to be announced this afternoon.
   When the strike ends, it will take weeks for producers to
prepare new shows.
   NBC is considering buying programs from the British Broadcasting
Co. or re-shooting old TV shows with different actors to avoid
reruns. Its ``The Cosby Show'' will continue in production under an
independent contract, and it has the Summer Olympics in September.
CBS is considering buying BBC shows. ABC plans to run the first 18
hours of its 30-hour miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' in November
instead of February.
   PBS is immune from the strike because its programs are produced
under a separate contract with the guild, and it also buys British
programming.
   Cable channels that produce first-run programming are affected
by the strike, though in most cases the effect hasn't been noticed
yet.
   Some first-run cable series, such as Showtime's ``Brothers,''
are at a standstill, just like network shows. Made-for-cable movies
for this fall were already written and will go on as scheduled, but
the strike had delayed development for next year.
   In the meantime, cable hopes its documentaries, musical specials
and made-for-cable movies that go on this fall as scheduled will
lure over some network viewers.
   Cable and PBS traditionally pick up viewers during the summer
when the networks are in reruns and see a possibility of the
seasonal advantage continuing into the fall.
   For the networks, the loss of viewers this fall could mean
increased audience erosion in favor of cable alternatives and
videocassettes.
   ``I think any time the cable networks can inch away a little
more viewership, some of the viewership will remain on cable in a
longer term,'' said Andy Orgel, senior vice president of
programming for the Arts & Entertainment Network, which hopes to
lure new viewers with sophisticated programming alternatives this
fall.
   At the end of the 1987-88 television season, most major cable
channels increased viewership. HBO, for example, increased 5
percent, while overall network audience levels dropped 9 percent.
Some of the drop is attributed to a change in A.C. Nielsen's
ratings technology, but the networks agree there is a decrease in
network viewing.
   Public television already staggers its series to attract viewers
to alternative programming when network shows are repeats. For
instance, ``Alive from Off Center,'' an avant-garde variety series,
starts its new season on PBS next week.
   Weil said PBS is not concerned about potential competition if
the networks buy BBC shows. She says most Americans are unaware
there is plenty of mediocre British television they don't usually
see. But she said if an infusion of foreign product helps raise the
level of U.S. television, that's fine, too.
   ``I never worry about somebody nibbling away at our turf,
because I think we should always be moving ahead,'' she said.
``It's going to be a long time before the networks get to `Alive
from Off Center.'''

   A combination of viewers away from their
televisions and writers away from their desks handed ABC its lowest
prime-time rating ever last week, according to figures from the
A.C. Nielsen Co.
   The Fourth of July weekend is traditionally a period of low
viewing for the networks, but the strike by the Writers Guild of
America forced some programs into early reruns and that helped
lower ABC's average to 8.0, said Alan Wurtzel, vice president for
marketing and research.
   ``It's not only just summer doldrums, but also the fact that the
writers' strike has really affected what people are able to see,''
he said. ``We went into a rerun mode earlier than we would have.
We've been playing reruns now for an awful long time.
   ``Believe me, it's not a number anybody is happy about. It's
just another reason strikes don't benefit anybody.''
   For the week ending July 3, ABC had a rating of 8.0. NBC won the
week with an 11.7. CBS was second with a 9.6. The lowest previous
rating for ABC was 8.7 two weeks ago and in July 1985.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's estimated 88.6
million households with televisions.
   NBC's first-run TV movie ``Nightingales'' was the top-rated show
of the week and seemingly would have been off to a good start as a
summer series, but there are no more episodes of the Aaron
Spelling-produced show because of the strike, according to NBC.
   The four-month-long strike has delayed the networks' fall
season. NBC maintains, however, that the current low viewing levels
are typical of summer rerun programming and do not reflect effects
of the strike, at least not yet.
   As a comparison of how low ratings have fallen, ``The Cosby
Show,'' the No. 1 show last season, had an season-long average
rating of 28.0 compared to 18.9 for ``Nightingales,'' the No. 1
show last week.
   The rest of the top 10 shows, all reruns, were: ``Night Court,''
``Cheers,'' ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World,'' ``L.A.
Law,'' ``Golden Girls'' and ``ALF,'' all NBC, ``Who's the Boss?''
on ABC, and NBC's ``The Hogan Family.''
   ABC's first-run summer series ``Hothouse'' premiered to a lowly
6.4 rating and was in 60th place.
   The lowest-rated prime-time shows of the week were: ``High
Mountain Rangers,'' ``Star-Spangled Celebration,'' ``Hothouse,''
``Sledge Hammer!'' ``CBS Summer Playhouse,'' ``Charmings Special,''
``Hotel,'' ``Spot Marks the X,'' ``MacGyver,'' ``Rags to Riches,''
``Supercarrier'' and ``Home Again.''
   CBS remained in first place in the close news race, finishing
the week ending July 1 with an average rating of 9.1 and a share of
20. NBC was second with a rating of 8.8 and a 20 share. ABC had an
8.4 and 19 share.
   The share is a percentage of sets in use.

<HEAD>Soviets Say They Crush Protest in Armenia, Deny Deaths</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet authorities acknowledge that paratroopers
crushed a protest by thousands of people who shut down a major
airport in Armenia. But they deny activists' claims that soldiers
killed as many as five protesters.
   The activists, pushing for annexation of a predominantly
Armenian region of the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan, charged
Wednesday that Red Army troops killed demonstrators at the airport
in Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   The latest round of protests began Monday with a general strike
and intensified Tuesday night with the airport clash, officials and
Armenian activists said.
   On Wednesday, the situation did not appear to be stabilizing.
   The evening television news program ``Vremya'' said hundreds of
thousands of Armenians thronged Yerevan's streets as the strike
continued.
   The government daily Izvestia said mass transit was still shut
down and the situation had worsened since Tuesday, when 26
factories and economic agencies in the southern republic were idled.
   Since February, Yerevan has been the scene of massive
demonstrations by Armenians demanding annexation of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. Until now, the protests had
reportedly been peaceful.
   On Wednesday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev told a
news conference ``the rumors that Armenians were killed are
groundless.''
   But he acknowledged that Soviet troops late Tuesday routed about
2,000 people from in and around the Zvartnots Airport. He said 36
people ``had to seek medical assistance'' after the clash.
   On Wednesday, the Communist Party daily Pravda said that during
a Tuesday rally in Yerevan's Theater Square, someone began calling
for a blockade of the airport and a large column of people headed
toward it on foot.
   Pravda said planes were allowed to land, but demonstrators
``grossly disrupted order'' and prevented them from taking off
again. Hundreds of passengers were stranded, it said.
   ``Vremya'' said 3,000 people took part in the protest and 60
flights were grounded along with 14,000 passengers.
   Perfilyev said about 400 people occupied the airport's terminal;
another 1,500 gathered outside, according to the official Tass news
agency.
   The demonstrators impeded the sale of tickets and the collection
of luggage, entered the landing strip and stopped passengers from
coming into the terminal, Perfilyev said.
   Security troops then moved in to evict the protesters, who began
hurling rocks and bottles _ and that's when the 36 casualties
occurred, he said.
   In Moscow, Armenian activists said witnesses had telephoned them
from Yerevan to say army troops carrying machine guns and backed by
tanks had begun firing without warning on the protesters.
   ``All of a sudden, they started shooting,'' artist Kuryun G.
Nagapetyan told about 50 people who gathered for a rally outside
Moscow's red-brick Armenian church. ``They were carrying clubs,
like policemen in the West, and they beat people right and left.''
   Three students were killed, he said, and 37 people reportedly
were hospitalized.
   Alexei Mananikov, an editor of the unofficial Moscow journal
Glasnost, said at least one man was killed and as many as 40 people
wounded by soldiers at the airport.
   Lev. G. Gambaryan, another Armenian who lives in Moscow, told
the rally that two children, ages 6 and 10, had also died of
gunshot wounds.
   But he and Nagapetyan said it was not certain whether the two
reported deaths were new or among the three previously reported.
   Ethnic Armenians make up the majority in Nagorno-Karabakh. They
have long been demanding that the mountainous region be transfered
to Armenia.
   Armenia supports the demand, but Azerbaijan has rejected it and
the issue has gone to officials in Moscow.
   In February, rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait left
dead 32 people _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.
   On Tuesday, newspapers reported that a general strike began in
Yerevan following a large meeting Sunday on the city's main square.
   The meeting Sunday was with delegates who had attended last
week's Communist Party conference in Moscow.
   Apparently dissatisfied with the Armenian delegation's
presentation of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, activists called a
strike.

   First lady Nancy Reagan capped a busy birthday
by attending ``Les Miserables'' at the Kennedy Center Opera House,
where the cast of the musical sang ``Happy Birthday'' and presented
her with a cake.
   Mrs. Reagan, escorted by President Reagan, blew out the single
candle on the large one-layer cake with white frosting as the first
couple mingled with the cast during intermission.
   When an actress asked Mrs. Reagan whether ``this makes you want
to get back into show business,'' the first lady replied: ``Yes.
You'll save a place for us?''
   Reagan quipped that this ``is much different than ``Bedtime For
Bonzo,'' one of the not-so-famous movies in which he played a
leading role.
   Reagan, 77, joked with the cast that when age sets in, three
things happen: ``First, you start to forget things, uh, and I can't
remember the other two.''
   Claude-Michel Schonberg, one of the adapters of the classic
Victor Hugo novel about social injustice in 19th century France,
sent a telegram congratulating Mrs. Reagan.
   Noting he shared her birthday, he said, ``Great people are
always born on the same day.''
   Accompanying the Reagans to the theater were the president's
daughter, Maureen Reagan, and her husband, Dennis Revell, along
with former Sen. Paul Laxalt and his wife, Carole.
   Although there's no disputing the day, the date of Mrs. Reagan's
birthday is a sensitive subject around the White House.
   Her official biography lists her birthdate as July 6, 1923, but
her high school and college records record the year as 1921, making
Wednesday her 67th birthday.
   Earlier Wednesday, Mrs. Reagan was treated to lunch at a country
inn, L'Auberge Chez Francois, in suburban Great Falls, Va., where
the staff presented her with a decorative ceramic teapot. She was
also given a song specially written for her by composer Marvin
Hamlisch, a frequent White House visitor.

<HEAD>NY City Opera Opens with `Merry Widow'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York City Opera opened its season in
mirthful fashion Wednesday with Franz Lehar's waltzing operetta
``The Merry Widow.''
   Soprano Leigh Munro sang the title role with credit, from the
poignant ``Vilia'' to her more rousing turns. Baritone Richard
White was splendid as Count Danilo, fond of the can-can girls at
Maxim's, fated to be landed as husband by the Merry Widow. White
conveyed Danilo's manly charm, whether his character was intending
to charm or making a fool of himself with jealousy. His singing was
robust without bluster and his only problem was some weak high
notes.
   The second romantic couple in the plot were more noticed than
usual because they sang so well. Ruth Gordon was Natalie, wife of
Baron Popoff, and Paul Austin Kelly made his debut as Vicomte de
Jolidon, her secret lover. Kelly doesn't sing ``The Merry Widow
Waltz,'' of course, but he has some of the evening's most romantic
music. As he sang about the little pavilion into which he's taking
Natalie, he sounded quietly romantic. Miss Gordon joined in, in
bittersweet tones. The audience lavished them with applause.
   James Billings, as the baron's flunky, Nisch, has the timing to
make the oldest jokes funny again. Richard McKee (Baron Popoff) had
delivery nearly as good.
   The production was in English at the New York State Theater.

   Opposition candidates accused the government
of fraud in presidential elections Wednesday and met jointly with
federal officials to protest. A journalist reported that an
8-year-old boy voted in one town.
   There appeared to be little doubt, however, that Carlos Salinas
de Gortari of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party,
would win a six-year term as president in an unbroken tradition
dating to 1929.
   Official returns were not expected before Sunday.
   Salinas de Gortari's most visible opponent, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
of the leftist coalition National Democratic Front, told a news
conference the government ``is intending to have a fraud.''
   ``We have begun to receive information nationwide that is not
favorable for the government party,'' he said, before leaving for
his meeting with Manuel J. Clouthier of the conservative National
Action Party and Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the radical
Revolutionary Workers Party.
   The three scheduled a news conference after their meeting with
Interior Secretary Manuel Bartlett.
   ``I want to tell you that all of these irregular acts, all of
these repeated acts throughout the country, have created a
situation of irregularity,'' Cardenas said.
   The party in power, known as the PRI, has won every presidential
election since its founding in 1929 and has controlled the congress
and governorships in all 31 states.
   Juan Enriquez, Salinas de Gortari's spokesman, said in an
intervew that any incident of fraud ``has been less than one tenth
of one percent of polling booths, and we're very pleased,''
   ``This has been a peaceful election in which the vote has been
respected,'' he said.
   This year, a clear deterioration of the PRI's influence was
evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by Cardenas and Clouthier.
   In addition to president, voters will elect 500 members of the
Chamber of Deputies to three-year terms and 64 senators to six-year
terms.
   All of the country's nearly 55,000 voting places closed by 6
p.m. (8 p.m. EDT) except for those where people were still lined up
to vote.
   The Federal Election Commission, which supervises the balloting,
said it received more than 50 complaints of voting irregularities,
most of them minor, from political parties. Complaints ranged from
missing ballots to a sailor who tried to vote repeatedly at
different polls in the port of Acapulco.
   The most flagrant incidents of purported fraud were reported in
Salinas de Gortari's adopted home town of Agualeguas, about 80
miles north of Monterrey near the U.S. border.
   Petra Hernandez, a reporter for the Monterrey daily El Norte,
said election officials ``let a lot of people vote for the whole
family. They voted for their wife, their kids, their mom who
couldn't come.''
   She said her paper had a picture of an 8-year-old boy who voted
with his father's voting card.
   Although opposition parties by law are allowed to have
representatives at each polling place, Ms. Hernandez said only PRI
representatives were at the town's three precincts.
   ``The president of one precinct also was filling out ballots. I
saw him get up nine times and put ballots in the boxes,'' she said.
   She said that when voters unfamiliar with the process would ask
the president of the precinct how to vote, ``he said, `Just take
the ballots and mark where it says PRI.'''
   Presidents of precincts are appointed by the government and are
always from PRI.
   PRI officials said they doubted the reports of fraud in
Agualeguas. ``It was a very peaceful vote ... obviously with a
preference for Salinas,'' said Enriquez.
   Almost all industry and commerce in Mexico closed for the day.
Traffic on normally bustling city streets was light.
   The commission issued no immediate figures on turnout among the
38 million eligible voters. But long lines were reported at polling
stations in major cities and towns.
   Outgoing President Miguel de la Madrid voted at a school across
from the presidential residence in Mexico City. His term expires
Dec. 1 and under the constitution he cannot be re-elected.
   De la Madrid won 70 percent of the vote in 1982. The victory
margin was not expected to be as wide for his likely successor,
Salinas de Gortari.
   Clouthier's conservative National Action Party and Cardenas'
National Democratic Front coalition have weakened the PRI's popular
support.
   Clouthier, Cardenas and Ibarra de Piedra signed an agreement
last week to fight fraud and pledged to challenge the results if
tampering was suspected.
   On Saturday, assassins with shotguns killed Francisco Xavier
Ovando, a long-time Cardenas collaborator and strategist in his
campaign, and an Ovando aid.
   Police said Tuesday the shootings were not politically
motivated. They said Ovando was killed in revenge for fighting
organized crime while serving as Michoacan attorney general when
Cardenas was governor of the state.
   Cardenas called the slayings ``a provocation'' and said it
showed how far ``some of the most reactionary sectors'' within the
PRI will go. He did not identify any group.
   The 54-year-old Cardenas ran on a platform of renewed
nationalism and was aided by the affection Mexicans still feel for
his father, the late President Lazaro Cardenas.
   Salinas de Gortari, a 40-year-old Harvard-educated economist,
was handicapped by having been de la Madrid's budget director and
author of his economic austerity program. He has pledged to
modernize the country's economic and political systems.
   Clouthier, a wealthy 54-year-old rancher and businessman from
northwestern Sinaloa state, said he would return even more
state-owned companies to the private sector and ask farmers if they
want the current system of cooperative farms or private property.

   A forest fire that consumed more than 4,000 acres of timber in
South Dakota's Custer State Park burned to within 4{ miles of Mount
Rushmore late Wednesday, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of
people over 40 square miles.
   The evacuation, which involved 600 people earlier Wednesday, was
broadened when the fire burned across the park's northern boundary
Wednesday night and entered Black Hills National Forest, site of
the granite memorial to four presidents.
   Gov. George Mickelson said it was likely the fire would get
worse.
   ``It makes you just sick to see the damage that's being done,''
he said after touring the area by helicopter.
   Afternoon winds hampered efforts to douse a 1,500-acre fire in
the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming, but crews in the
Shoshone National Forest to the north were controlling the way a
1,650-acre fire was burning.
   Three other fires in Wyoming covered about 1,900 acres of
backcountry in Yellowstone National Park, while firefighters
battled 850-acre blazes in both a Utah park and a Southern
California forest.
   The three other Wyoming fires, one of which covered 1,800 acres
in the northwestern corner of the park, were set by lightning
strikes. Park crews were allowing them to burn because the fires
were not threatening any structures.
   Extremely dry conditions in Custer State Park were contributing
to the spread of the South Dakota fire, which authorities believe
was started by lightning Monday night.
   Firefighters had difficulty building a fire line because the
blaze was burning in a very steep, rocky area, fire spokesman Jerry
Hagen said. Planes were dropping fire-retardant chemicals once an
hour, but Hagen said the fire was nowhere near being contained.
   The fire earlier was estimated at 6,000 acres, but Hagen said
thick smoke made that number faulty, and it was revised to 4,000
acres.
   About 125 people living around Mount Rushmore National Memorial
were told to leave their homes late Wednesday night as a
precaution, said Custer County Sheriff Vernon Sprague.
   Officials also advised residents of Keystone, about two miles
from Mount Rushmore, to go to a Red Cross shelter in Rapid City or
an armory in Custer. Although Keystone only has about 300
residents, officials said up to 2,000 people might be in the area
because it's the height of the tourist season.
   Hagen said the 40-square-mile area area evacuated was mainly
national forest land but added, ``It looks to me like there's some
private land, some homes and some mining claims.''
   One firefighter was hurt, but his injury was not believed
serious, Hagen said.
   Smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air, with the plume
visible in Rapid City, 25 miles away. A haze from the smoke hung
over a large part of western South Dakota and was visible from
Pierre, 160 miles away.
   All entrances to the park were closed Wednesday and 600 people
were evacuated. Authorities said no structures had burned, but
buildings were not considered safe.
   The fire had been burning toward the northeast but switched to
the northwest Wednesday and was 7-8 miles south of Mount Rushmore
National Memorial.
   Mickelson declared an emergency, releasing state resources to
fight the blaze, and planned to view the fire by helicopter, said
his press secretary.
   In Wyoming, gusting winds that spread the fire in the
Bridger-Teton forest Tuesday built again Wednesday afternoon,
threatening crews' hopes of containing the blaze by evening, said
forest spokesman Fred Kingwill.
   A volunteer firefighter was taken to the Salt Lake City Burn
Center with serious burns on his hands, arms and chest, Kingwill
said.
   The fire, burning in sagebrush, juniper and aspen groves near
the southern end of Fremont Lake, was sparked by Fourth of July
revelers, the Forest Service said.
   In the Shoshone National Forest, fire commander ``Tut'' Anderson
said, ``The fire now is responding to our management as opposed to
us responding to the fire behavior.'' The blaze was touched off by
lightning almost two weeks ago.
   In Utah's Zion National Park, firefighters carved fire lines
around half a blaze that blackened heavy oak and manzanita brush
and Ponderosa pine, officials said.
   About 120 firefighters were battling the lightning-caused blaze,
and another 80 were standing by, said Park Superintendent Harry
Grafe.
   The fire began June 19 and was allowed to burn in a small area
until Sunday, when winds up to 60 mph spread the flames, said Chief
Ranger Bob Andrew.
   Winds eased to 10 mph Wednesday and Andrew said fire bosses
predicted they would contain the blaze by Thursday evening.
   No injuries or property damage were reported.
   Another southern Utah fire broke out and consumed about 3,000
acres by late Wednesday on Bureau of Land Management and private
land about 3 miles north of Beryl , fire dispatcher Wayne Hunt
said. The cause was undetermined.
   About 290 firefighters as well as air tankers battled a brush
fire in Los Padres National Forest near San Luis Obispo in Southern
California, authorities said.
   Temperatures were in the 90s, humidity was low and moderate
winds of 5 mph to 15 mph fanned the blaze but no structures were
threatened, said Juanita Freel, a forest spokeswoman.
   The cause of the blaze, which broke out Tuesday afternoon, was
undetermined.
   In Kentucky, state forestry officials responded to 26 fires on
567 acres Tuesday, spokesman Townley Bergmann said. At least three
of the fires reported Tuesday remained burning Wednesday and 14 new
fires were reported by Wednesday afternoon.

<HEAD>Nationalists Open Party Congress With Tough Talk On Communists,
Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHIRLEY LAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LINKOU, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Lee Teng-hui opened a key
congress of the ruling Nationalist Party today with a cautious
promise of more democratic change and tough talk on rival Communist
China.
   The landmark meeting began at a suburban Taipei sports stadium
packed with more than 10,000 people.
   Behind the podium hung three huge portraits of the 94-year-old
party's three previous leaders _ Sun Yat-sen, Chiang Kai-shek and
his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, who died in January.
   The congress, the party's 13th, is the first in which delegates
were not handpicked by top party officials and in which a Central
Committee election was not restricted to candidates proposed by the
party leader.
   It comes at a time of increasing political liberalization in
Taiwan, a nation slowly emerging from its authoritarian past.
   The congress' 1,209 delegates are expected to elevate a new
generation of party leaders to replace aging conservatives who came
from the mainland with Chiang Kai-shek after the Communists forced
the Nationalists from mainland China in 1949.
   An overhaul of the Cabinet also is expected after the congress,
with speculation centering on the fate of 74-year-old Premier Yu
Kuo-hwa, who is viewed as the leading conservative.
   Lee, the acting party chairman since Chiang's death, said in his
speech that the Nationalists ``should accelerate the implementation
of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an
even more active and responsible attitude.''
   But he cautioned that ``extremism and violence are the greatest
enemies of democracy,'' an apparent reference to recent street
demonstrations for accelerated political change. Those protests
have occasionally turned violent.
   In his final years, Chiang Ching-kuo ended Taiwan's 38-year-old
martial law, tolerated the formation of opposition parties, opened
the door to unofficial contact with rival Communist China and
relaxed controls on the press.
   In cautiously pushing more reform, Lee's speech appeared
tailored to placate both aging Nationalist conservatives, some of
whom may step down during the congress, and younger party members
who support more political, social and economic liberalization.
   Winston Chang, a party delegate, described Lee as ``a man of
tolerance'' with elements of a good party leader. Indeed, Lee is
expected to be named the party's permanent chairman on Friday.
   ``He accepts different opinions and absorbs them,'' said Chang,
an illegitimate son of Chiang Ching-kuo who took his mother's
surname.
   Lee spent much of his 30-minute speech reiterating Taiwan's
hardline policy of no official contacts with the Chinese Communists.
   Both the Nationalists, or Kuomintang, and Communists claim to be
the rightful ruler of mainland China and Taiwan.
   Lee accused Beijing of having ``blind ambition to destroy'' the
Nationalist government. ``We have no illusions about the Chinese
Communist regime and will make no compromise of any kind with
them.''
   The Nationalists have rejected Beijing's call for reunification
under a ``one country, two systems'' policy in which Taiwan could
retain its capitalist economy.
   Unofficial contact between the two sides has increased recently,
particularly with Chiang Ching-kuo's decision last year to end a
ban on travel to the mainland to allow family reunions.
   Indirect trade also has increased and many businessmen are
seeking permission to invest and trade directly with China's 1
billion people.
   The future China policy of this nation of about 20 million
people is expected to be a hot topic at the congress, with some
delegates pushing for increased trade and exchanges.

   Swimming along a 25-mile stretch of Long
Island's South Shore was prohibited Wednesday after medical waste,
including blood vials and syringes, washed ashore, officials said.
   State, county and town beaches were advised to forbid swimming
until health inspectors determine that the waters are safe, said
Shelly Domash, a spokeswoman for the Nassau County Health
Department.
   Beaches were closed from Long Beach in southwest Nassau County
east to Robert Moses State Park in southwest Suffolk County, she
said. The area includes the popular Jones Beach State Park.
   Officials were trying to determine the origin of the debris.
Domash said it may have been illegally dumped by a hospital or
laboratory.
   The discovery came just as a heat wave moved over the region,
with forecasters predicting temperatures in the 90s through the
weekend. Hundreds of thousands of people usually flock to the
beaches on the weekends.
   Two syringes were spotted at Nassau Beach on Tuesday, Domash
said. On Wednesday as the tide came in, a vial of blood, empty
vials and a medical scrub brush were found at Lido Beach, then two
more syringes at Nassau Beach, she said. At East Atlantic Beach, a
glass container and surgical sutures washed up.
   Two truckloads of debris _ including a red waste bag, apparently
carrying infectious hospital waste, filled and empty vials and
syringes, bandages, grease balls, seaweed and firecrackers _ were
removed from the beaches at Lido Beach, Domash said.
   Ronald F. Foley, the regional director of the New York State
Parks, said Jones Beach State Park and Robert Moses State Park were
closed after a handful of debris, including plastic wrappers and
what appeared to be parts of syringes, were found at the parks'
beaches Wednesday.
   ``It's the unknown _ you don't know what it is or what it's
carrying,'' Foley said. ``We wanted to be on the safe side.''

<HEAD>Democrats Have Votes to Override Veto of Plant-Closing Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holding enough votes this time to override a
veto, Democrats are forcing a second election-year showdown with
President Reagan over giving workers advance notice of plant
closings and large layoffs.
   On a 72-23 vote Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill requiring
companies to give 60 days' notice before shutting down any
operation or instituting a layoff affecting more than 50 people or
a third of the work force.
   President Reagan cited the mandated notices as his primary
reason for vetoing a massive overhaul of the nation's trade laws
two months ago, saying advance notices would reduce U.S.
competitiveness and stifle new job creation.
   But with polls showing more than 80 percent voter support for
the measure and Democrats using the issue to attack the economic
policies of Reagan and Vice President George Bush, 19 Republicans _
including seven up for re-election _ broke with the White House on
Wednesday's vote.
   Wednesday's vote was the biggest legislative victory for
organized labor since it helped return the Senate to Democratic
control in the 1986 election after Republicans held the majority
the first six years of Reagan's presidency.
   Just nine Senate Republicans supported the mandatory notices a
year ago, when they were made a part of the trade bill. And only 10
broke ranks last month when the Senate, on a 61-37 vote, fell five
votes short of the necessary two-thirds for overriding Reagan's
veto.
   ``I'm certain that it's going to become law,'' lamented Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a leading opponent of the notice bill. ``The
tragedy is that we're doing this all because of politics.''
   A White House official said after the vote that Reagan has not
stated definitely that he will veto it. The official, speaking on
the condition of anonymity, said the president's advisers were
divided on the issue even though the administration put out a
statement prior to the vote saying they would urge him to veto it.
   ``I don't know what the president's going to do when he gets
this bill,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who
complained earlier about labor leaders ``wielding a lot of clout in
this body.''
   Both supporters and opponents of the legislation raised the
possibility that Reagan might allow the bill to become law after
the expected House approval without signing it. Under the
Constitution, a president has only 10 working days to veto a bill
after passage by both houses.
   ``I would hope that the president would see there are sufficient
votes to override a veto and that will mean that he won't veto
it,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the bill's chief author.
   Had the measure been law the past two years, more than 800,000
workers who were laid off each year in 1986 and 1987 would have
received advance notices, he said.
   A 1985 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that more
than half the 2.2 million workers caught up in mass layoffs
annually received one day's notice or less before losing their jobs.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the
Senate-passed bill will be taken up in the House early next week,
to be followed immediately by House action on a revised trade bill
that doesn't include the plant-closing notices.
   The House has never voted on the plant-closing issue itself. But
its 308-113 vote in May to override Reagan's veto of the trade bill
is viewed as assuring veto-proof passage there as well.
   The AFL-CIO made the layoff notices its top legislative priority
the past two years and vowed to withdraw its pivotal support for
any trade legislation desired by major business groups if the
measure were not included or enacted separately.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland called Wednesday's vote margin
overwhelming and a ``welcome message for American workers.''
   GOP opponents won a minor political skirmish along the way. They
stalled the vote for two weeks, effectively denying Democrats a
chance to override a Reagan veto before the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta.
   A year ago, the mandatory notices were opposed by four Democrats
and 36 Republicans. The four Democrats _ Dale Bumpers and David
Pryor of Arkansas, David Boren of Oklahoma and Fritz Hollings of
South Carolina _ had all switched sides by the time of the vote
last month on overriding Reagan's veto.
   So had five Republicans, three of them up for re-election this
year _ John Chafee of Rhode Island, John Danforth of Missouri and
William Roth of Delaware.
   By Wednesday's vote, another seven Republicans switched sides _
David Karnes of Nebraska, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, Bob Kasten of
Wisconsin, John McCain of Arizona, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and John
Warner of Virginia. Of that group, only Karnes is up for election
this year.

<HEAD>Decline In Dollar Helps Cut US Labor Costs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the smallest wage increases of any
industrial nation and help from a sinking dollar, U.S. factories
outperformed their foreign rivals last year in reducing labor costs
and making their goods more competitive on world markets.
   Measured in devalued American dollars, labor costs in the United
States declined 1.5 percent in 1987, compared with increases of 7.5
percent in South Korea, 7.7 percent in Canada, 13.5 percent in
Japan and 23.9 percent in West Germany, the Labor Department said
Wednesday.
   But even before the dramatic devaluation of the dollar against
major European and Asian currencies, the United States outperformed
all but Japan in keeping a lid on labor costs.
   Measured by their own currency, the yen, Japanese manufacturers
reduced their labor costs by 2.5 percent. Excluding France, labor
costs rose for nine other major industrial powers.
   ``Clearly there's a definite improvement in out competitiveness
vis-a-vis our trading partners,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist
for the Boston Co., a New York consulting house. ``But we still
have a long way to go to restore the competitiveness we lost over
the past decade.''
   The government data showed that labor costs, measured in
American dollars, rose an average 3.3 percent annually from 1979
through 1985 while falling 2.3 percent in Japan, 1.8 percent in
Korea, 4.8 percent in West Germany and 2.4 percent in Great Britain.
   Wage increases in the United States averaging 6.9 percent
annually those years also outpaced the gains enjoyed by workers in
all of the other countries when measured in dollars.
   U.S. manufacturers, however, held hourly wage and benefit
increases last year to just 1.3 percent, the lowest of any of the
industrial powers, according to the government data.
   Japan was close with wage and benefit increases averaging 1.4
percent. But wages rose 4 percent in West Germany and 4.5 percent
in Canada while soaring 8.2 percent in Great Britain.
   But with civilian unemployment in the United States now hovering
in the range of 5{ percent, Sinai noted that wage increases have
been escalating rapidly the past two months.
   ``That suggests that our labor costs are rising at the same time
that the dollar has quit falling,'' Sinai said. ``This year we will
not repeat the experience of last year.''
   For one thing, he said, declines in the industrial sectors of
Japan, Great Britain and West Germany have all bottomed out and
they are begining to enjoy the same rebound in manufacturing that
the United States has experienced in the past year.
   The Labor Department figures, in fact, showed that manufacturing
growth last year was slower in the United States than in Canada,
Korea, Italy and Great Britain.
   U.S. productivity improvements at 2.8 percent also were smaller
than 4 percent gains of Japan, France and Italy, 7 percent increase
in Great Britain and nearly 8 percent improvement in Norway.
   While five of the nine countries had larger 1987 productivity
increases than the United States, only Great Britain and Norway
exceeded the U.S. rate of improvement over the past two years, the
government said.
   However, only the United States and Canada experienced any
employment growth in manufacturing last year. The U.S. increase was
only one-half of 1 percent, but it reversed two straight years of
declines.
   Factory jobs remained about the same in Germany and Sweden and
fell by 1 percent to 2.5 percent in the other countries.
   For France, 1987 was the 13th consecutive year of manufacturing
employment declines and in Great Britain factory jobs have been
falling in number for the past 10 years.

<HEAD>DOE Advisory Board Backs Construction Of New Reactor in South
Carolina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department report favors building a
new reactor in South Carolina over converting a mothballed one in
Washington state to ensure an adequate supply of raw materials for
the nation's nuclear weapons.
   The department's existing production reactors are located at the
Savannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., but all of them presently
are shut down.
   The report found that construction of a new heavy-water reactor
at Savannah River would result in a plant based on reliable
technology and located in a setting with years of experience in
producing and handling tritium, a key element in nuclear bombs.
   ``The heavy-water reactor appears to have the best chance of
quickly providing the needed capacity because of existing
facilities, personnel and experiences at Savannah River,'' the
report said.
   The report said that while conversion of the mothballed
Washington Public Power Supply System nuclear plant at the Hanford
reservation offered some ``unique opportunities,'' both legal and
technical uncertainties presented serious drawbacks.
   Although the report conceded that conversion of the WPPSS plant
may not take as long to complete or cost as much, at least
initially, as other options, it cited other problems.
   ``There are risks because of the need to demonstrate an adequate
target technology, uncertainties of public acceptance of conversion
to defense purposes, and possible delays because of the legal
process required to acquire the WPPSS facility,'' the report said.
   The commercial reactor was more than 60 percent complete when
mothballed in 1982 as WPPSS, the construction arm of public
utilities in Washington state, ran into financial difficulties and
questions were raised about whether the electricity the plant would
produce would be needed.
   The Energy Research Advisory Board report was released by
Washington Democratic Sen. Brock Adams, a leading opponent of
converting the WPPSS plant, and other Northwest congressional
offices.
   ``I've said all along that conversion is the wrong option and
should not be pursued,'' said Adams. ``This report reaches the same
conclusion.''
   One of the Savannah River production reactors is undergoing
extensive work to fortify it against earthquakes. Another has been
closed for the summer because its discharge is too warm to comply
with state water quality regulations and the third is undergoing
routine maintenance.

<HEAD>Exchange Students Tour Landfill, Trash Incinerator on First Outing</HEAD>

   Soviet exchange students spending the
summer at picturesque Dartmouth College made their first official
excursion off campus _ to a dump, a metal recycling operation and a
trash incinerator.
   Not exactly the kind of trip you would write home about, unless
you were majoring in environmental studies, which they are. So the
garbage bags, piles of tires, crushed cars and discarded wood were
just want they wanted to see.
   ``Welcome to the city of Lebanon landfill,'' dump superintendent
Alfred Besaw said Wednesday as the students gathered close to hear
how his operation works.
   Some took notes, others took photos of news photographers taking
photos of them and one consulted a Russian-American dictionary
before asking a question about the trash.
   The 16 Soviet students have been in New Hampshire since late
June, part of an exchange in which 16 Americans, mostly from
Dartmouth, spent about six weeks at Moscow State University. The
students major in areas including chemistry, molecular biology and
biophysics.
   Most have completed four years of their five-year college
studies and will likely be scientists, teachers and researchers in
the Soviet Union, which is trying to deal with the same
environmental problems plaguing the United States _ water and air
pollution, acid rain, hazardous waste and trash disposal.
   The outing to the dump and Signal Environmental Systems'
refuse-to-energy plant in Claremont was the first time the students
met reporters, which meant interviews atop clay-covered mounds of
trash, next to cans of discarded copper tubing or next to a garbage
truck being weighed before dumping its load at the incinerator.
   They drove from the hot, dusty dump to an adjacent hotter and
dustier metal recycling area, where a shirtless Fred Janci of Janci
Metal and Recycling explained his business.
   Dimitrij Kavtaradze, a Moscow State professor teaching at
Dartmouth this year, picked up a horseshoe _ ``This is the best
souvenir from America, good luck!'' _ and asked Janci if he could
keep it.
   Janci said yes.
   After seeing how trash is buried or prepared for re-use, it was
off to the incinerator to learn about another way to dispose of
refuse, burning _ again taking pictures and notes.
   Professor Burdin Konstantin, also from Moscow State, said the
main purpose of the visit is to learn how the United States deals
with environmental problems.
   ``The main thing is to see what kinds of problems are in the
United States and how do you solve these problems,'' Konstantin
said.
   The United States, he said, ``is on the frontier'' of dealing
with environmental problems. The American experience, he said,
should help Soviets struggling with the same problems, especially
with questions of balancing growth with the environment and even
with citizen opposition to construction projects such as a sewer
proposal that prompted protest near Moscow.
   And the exchange experience may help his students understand
more about America.
   ``We should understand people. We should understand problems. We
cannot separate problems and people,'' he said. ``In some ways it's
people diplomacy.''
   Some of the students talked about their first impressions of the
United States, saying they were impressed with the highways and
friendly people.
   ``They are very friendly people,'' said Olga Divovich of Moscow.
``They often smile at us and it's very pleasant for us.''

   More than 300 politicians from at least 104
countries are to attend Democratic National Convention in Atlanta,
according to the National Democratic Institute for International
Affairs.
   ``As a party with a historical commitment to an internationbal
vision, we also want to learn from our guests' experiences - to
join with them in a dialogue to deepen our shared commitmern to
democratic values and pratcices,'' said former Vice President
Walter Mondale, chairman of the institute.
   An International Visitors Lounge will be set up at the Georgia
World Congress Center, adjacent to the hall where the convention
meets. The visitors will get simultaneous translations of
convention proceedings in Spanish and French.
   Prominent guests who have accepted the institute's invitiation
include John Hume, member of the British parliament from Northern
Ireland; Kazuo Tanikawa of the Japanese Diet, former Premier Adolfo
Suarez of Spain; Markus Aaltonen, chairman of the Foreign Affairs
Committee of the Finnish parliament and Guatemalan first lady
Raquel Cerezo; Leonel Brizola.
   On July 21, as the convention ends, there will be a special
program for members of the Washington diplomatic corps who will go
to Atlanta for the day. The institute said 108 have accepted the
invitation.

   A coalition of women activists is urging the
presidential candidates make a commitment to appoint more women to
executive positions in the new administration.
   The Coalition for Women's Appointments said Wednesday it will
conduct a bipartisan effort to recruit and recommend qualified
women for presidential appointments, said Irene Natividad,
chairwoman of the National Women's Political Caucus.
   ``We're looking beyond the campaign to show the next
administration that the gender gap does more than deliver votes;
it's also bulging with talent,'' said Natividad.
   Too often, men have voiced a ``we-can't-find-any syndrome,''
said Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., co-chairman of Vice President George
Bush's presidential campaign.
   She and other participants in a news conference said the goal of
about 50 women's groups in the coalition is to counter that
syndrome by making known the names and resumes of women who have
qualifications for high government posts.

   The Democratic State Convention this week
will feature a speech by former Sen. George McGovern and some
battles for two important party posts.
   Only one nomination for a statewide office is up for grabs at
the three-day convention in Huron, where delegates planned to begin
preliminary work today. The incumbent national committeeman and
national committeewoman both face challenges as they seek new
four-year terms, said state Democratic Party Executive Director
Rick Hauffe.
   Republicans currently hold a two-thirds majority in both the
state House and Senate, but Democrats for the first time in years
are fielding candidates for nearly every one of the 105 legislative
seats.
   ``We're on the brink of what could be a very successful era for
the Democratic Party because there's a need for change,'' Hauffe
said. ``They (voters) want new faces, new leaders, new directions.''
   McGovern, and two members of South Dakota's congressional
delegation, Sen. Tom Daschle and Rep. Tim Johnson and Eisnach will
speak to the convention delegates on Saturday. Hubert Humphrey III,
Minnesota's atttorney general and a candidate for the Senate, will
deliver the keynote address at the Saturday night banquet that will

   The FBI arrested a Kentucky prison escapee
who also was wanted on murder charges following a breakout by eight
inmates.
   Billy Hall, 25, of Paducah, Ky., surrendered without incident to
FBI agents at a Western Union office Wednesday, agent Terry Kincaid
said.
   Hall and seven others escaped June 16 from the Kentucky State
Penitentiary in Eddyville. Only two escapees remain at large,
authorities said.
   Hall, who was serving a 23-year sentence for burglary and
assault, may have been in Mexico and crossed the border trying to
get money, Kincaid said.
   ``We had developed information that he may be in the area. We
were alert for his presence,'' he said.
   Hall and two other escapees were indicted Friday by a Stewart
County, Tenn., grand jury for the shotgun slayings of a Dover,
Tenn., couple, Buford Vester, 71, and Myrtle Vester, 69. Their
bodies were found a few days after the prison break.
   The breakout and slayings were the subject of this week's
television episode of ``America's Most Wanted.''
   Hall was in the El Paso County Jail awaiting a warrant from
Kentucky, Kincaid said.
   The two remaining escapees are: James Blanton, 29, of Farler,
Ky., who was serving time for murder; and Derek Quintero, 26, of
Clarksville, Tenn., serving 37 years for kidnapping and robbery.

<HEAD>President Roh Offers Plan To Ease Tensions With North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo today announced
a six-point plan to ease 40 years of bitter confrontation with
communist North Korea and clear the way for peaceful reunification
of the divided peninsula.
   In a nationally televised speech, the president called for broad
trade, humanitarian, cultural and political contacts with the north
to normalize relations and end the struggle for supremacy.
   ``I believe we have now come to a historic moment when we should
be able to find a breakthrough toward a lasting peace and
unification on the Korean peninsula,'' Roh said.
   He called for an end to international rivalry between the two
Koreas in foreign diplomacy, saying the two nations should work
together instead of competing for international backing and trying
to isolate each other.
   ``We hope to bring an end to counterproductive diplomacy
characterized by competition and confrontation between the south
and the north ... We also hope that representatives of South and
North Korea will contact each other freely in international
forums,'' he said.
   The six points, most of which had already been mentioned by Roh
in recent weeks, were similar or identical to proposals made by
other South Korean governments since 1972.
   Roh's proposals did not go as far as a call by President Chun
Doo-hwan for a meeting with North Korean President Kim Il Sung in
1981 that never took place. Roh said more measures would be taken
if North Korea ``will positively respond to the measures outlined.''
   In a separate development, the South Korean Defense Ministry
warned today that the north ``is inevitably expected to provoke war
if the opportunity arises'' and had not given up its plans to
conquer the south.
   A group of newspaper editors were told at a ministry briefing
that the north continues to mass its forces on the border for a
possible lightning strike. The ministry routinely makes such
warnings, but it was not clear why the briefing was held the same
day as Roh's speech.
   South and North Korea have no relations and technically remain
at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean
War in 1953. The border is closed, there are no communications or
transport links and both governments refuse to recognize each other.
   The pro-Western capitalist south is emerging as a major economic
power, while the communist north is one of the world's most
repressive and isolated nations.
   There was no immediate response from the north, but unification
is not seen as possible under existing conditions with both Koreas
refusing to abandon their rival political systems.
   South Korea's main opposition parties, which have been pressing
the government to move ahead on unification, cautiously welcomed
Roh's proposal as a ``forward looking step.''
   Roh said the south would no longer try to stop nations it has
ties with from trading with the north ``provided that it does not
involve military goods.''
   He also said Seoul would help the north establish relations with
South Korea's allies, including the United States and Japan. South
Korea would continue to seek relations with the north's allies,
principally the Soviet Union and China, he said.
   South and North Korea have been bitter opponents since their
creations in 1948 after U.S. and Soviet troops divided the Korean
peninsula at the end of World War II.
   The communist north invaded the south in 1950 to start the
Korean War.
   Unification has become a major issue in the south in recent
months with radical and dissident groups pushing for quick action
to reunite the peninsula. The Roh government, caught off guard on
the issue, has been trying to recapture the political iniative.
   Past attempts at improving relations between the two countries
resulted in a few exchange and cultural visits and talks on a
variety of issues. But the talks always collapsed before making
substantial progress.
   The last talks between the two Koreas collapsed in 1986 after
the north protested joint South Korean-U.S. military exercises. The
United States has about 42,000 troops in the south under a mutual
defense treaty.

   A lawsuit accusing a top defense
contractor of charging the government for everything from building
a private plane to typing the Bible into a computer could open the
way for fraud investigations into top-secret projects, a watchdog
group says.
   ``What we have is a little wedge into the `black' world,''
projects so secret they often don't appear on the defense budget,
said Dina Rasor, head of the Washington-based Project on Military
Procurement.
   ``(It shows) you can expose fraud and waste in a black program''
without divulging sensitive information, she said.
   Rasor spoke at a news conference Wednesday to unseal the lawsuit
alleging fraud and overcharging against Lockheed Missiles & Space
Co., the leading defense contractor in California's high-tech
Silicon Valley.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court by a former and a
current employee, claims Lockheed workers, while waiting months for
security clearances, goofed off, ran profitable businesses, ran a
football pool and even built a private plane _ all at government
expense.
   If proved, the charges could result in suspension of defense
contracts.
   The alleged violations at one California plant cost the
government more than $10 million, but that figure could go higher,
the plaintiffs' attorney said.
   ``We expect additional people are going to step forward and
describe additional examples of fraud at Lockheed,'' said Oakland
lawyer Guy T. Saperstein.
   Lockheed, the plaintiffs also charged, told employees to bill
various government contracts for 40 hours even if they worked less
and to charge their time to contracts on which they had not worked.
   Lockheed denied the accusations.
   ``We very vigorously deny that false claims have been or are
made or condoned by the company,'' said company spokesman George
Mulhern. ``In fact, we've had a very strong program over the past
several years to make sure all employees know any form of
mischarging is wrong and can lead to disciplinary action, including
dismissal, if warranted.''
   Mulhern said the company would wait until it receives a copy of
the suit before responding to specific allegations.
   ``(But) we are also very confident the suit, if it goes to
trial, will show the company has not engaged in any improper
practices,'' he said.
   Lockheed Missiles & Space, with 23,700 employees in Sunnyvale,
develops spacecraft, satellite systems and submarine-launched
missiles. It is a subsidiary of Lockheed Corp.
   The suit was filed under a federal whistle-blower law by
Margaret T. Newsham, 45, a former Lockheed analyst, and Martin
Overbeek Bloem, 34, an engineer who works for the company. The
United States also is a plaintiff.
   The law protects whistle-blowers from retaliation and allows
them to keep some of the judgments against companies convicted of
cheating the government.
   The complaint, which seeks damages and a jury trial, is one of
the first false claims suits involving a classified ``black''
project for the National Security Agency, a surveillance branch of
the Defense Department.
   Newsham and Bloem, who both held security clearances from the
NSA, worked at Lockheed on the project from 1981 to 1984.
   They allege that ``a huge amount'' of time was wasted at
Lockheed in the ``ice box,'' a period ranging from a year to 18
months during which employees could not work on sensitive projects
until they received security clearance.
   ``Rather than being given non-classified work, their time was
wasted,'' Saperstein said. ``When the end of the week rolled
around, they billed the United States government for 40 hours for
no work, essentially.''
   Employees allegedly found ways to keep busy, including selling
real estate, honey and belt buckles or working on their cars or
playing computer games.
   One senior manager, the suit says, had Lockheed machinists build
him an airplane and was allowed to retire and take the plane with
him when the project was discovered.
   ``One Lockheed employee wrote out the entire Bible onto a
Lockheed computer, charging government contracts for his time,''
the suit says.
   Newsham was fired in 1984. She said the company refused to give
a reason.
   The Defense Contract Audit Agency substantiated the allegations
after Newsham called a Defense Department ``hot line'' in 1984,
Saperstein said. Reports from the agency, which has no enforcement
power, were filed with the suit.

<HEAD>FDIC Fails To Sell Continental Loans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. say the agency has been unable to sell nearly $1 billion in
bad loans acquired in the largest-ever government bank bailout.
   Steven Seelig, associate director of the FDIC's division of
liquidation, said Wednesday a plan approved by the FDIC board in
February to publicly offer the loans from Continental Illinois
Corp. in six large portfolios failed, but he said the agency would
begin immeditately trying to sell the loans in smaller packages.
   The Chicago-based bank, then the seventh largest in the nation,
in 1984 ceived $4.5 billion _ $3.5 billion of it borrowed from the
Federal Reserve System _ in an unprecendented move by the FDIC.
   As part of the rescue, the FDIC took over many of Continental
Illinois' problem loans and acquired ownership of the bank's stock.
It expects to recoup all but $1.7 billion of the bailout money by
selling the loans and the stock.
   The FDIC insures accounts in commercial banks up to $100,000.

   Black-clad mourners shook fists in anger
as they marched behind Iranian flag-draped coffins, vowing to
avenge the U.S. Navy's downing of an Iran Air passenger jet with
290 people aboard.
   The mourners waved banners and shouted ``Revenge, Revenge'' and
``Down with Reagan'' as 24 of the victims were buried on Wednesday.
   A team of U.S. military experts, meanwhile, arrived in Bahrain
and began their inquiry into the attack by questioning senior
officers of the Navy cruiser that fired the fatal missiles, U.S.
sources said.
   In Iran, the manager of the airport where the Iran Air Airbus
A300 originated was quoted as saying the Navy failed to use the
proper frequency when it issued a warning before firing two
missiles at the plane.
   Iran said 200 bodies had been recovered from the Persian Gulf
since the USS Vincennes destroyed the plane Sunday. All but 38 of
those aboard were Iranians.
   Fourteen were buried Wednesday in Bandar Abbas and ten others
were buried at Zahedan, in southeastern Iran, Iranian television
reported.
   The television broadcast 15 minutes of scenes from the funerals.
   In Bandar Abbas, women clad in black chadors marched behind
coffins and carried banners, some of which read: ``America: You
fight with weapons and we with our belief in God, and your defeat
is imminent.''
   Men waved their fists, shouting ``Death to America!'' Coffins
were draped with the green, white and red Iranian flag.
   Iran says the Vincennes intentionally shot down the Airbus over
the Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf.
   The United States says the Vincennes fired because the vessel's
combat information center identified the approaching aircraft as an
F-14 fighter on an attack bearing.
   The aircraft, on a scheduled flight to Dubai from Bandar Abbas,
was shot down while the Navy ship was engaged in battle with
Iranian gunboats, U.S. officials said.
   A six-member military investigating team arrived from the United
States late Tuesday and began probing the tragedy.
   U.S. military sources said the team planned to interview Capt.
Will C. Rogers III, skipper of the Vincennes, and other officers
present during the crisis.
   The Bandar Abbas airport manager, Hossein Peroussi, was quoted
in today's Chicago Tribune as saying he was in the control tower
when the plane left for Dubai on Sunday.
   ``The situation was quite normal. The airplane was right on
course.'' he was quoted as saying.
   The Iranian government let more than 100 foreign correspondents
into Iran Wednesday to interview airport personnel and view bodies
of victims.
   Peroussi was quoted as denying Pentagon claims the Vincennes
sent warnings to the plane on both ultra-high frequency and
very-high frequency radio channels. He said the Navy uses only UHF
channels to warn approaching aircraft.
   ``That is useless for the Airbus, because he is on VHF,'' he
said. ``We heard the Navy every day; they did not announce a
warning on VHF.''
   Peroussi said transponders on the plane emitted signals ``only
in a civilian mode, not a military mode.''' The Pentagon said the
Vincennes received both types of signals from the plane.
   A plane carrying the remains of 71 of the victims had to abort
its takeoff on Wednesday when some of the coffins toppled over
inside the plane, the Tribune reported. It said about 12 Western
reporters were aboard.
   The pilot of the C-130 braked to a halt just before takeoff, the
newspaper said. The plane was en route to Tehran, it said.
   Iranian officials showed the bodies of the victims to reporters,
including cutting open one body bag and displaying a woman holding
a baby in her arms, the paper said.

   A U.S. destroyer aimed its
weapons at a helicopter chartered by a television news crew after
two warnings to keep clear apparently were lost in the din of
Persian Gulf radio traffic.
   The incident occurred Wednesday, three days after the American
cruiser Vincennes shot down an Iran Air Airbus A300, killing all
290 people aboard.
   The United States says the Vincennes, which had just finished a
skirmish with Iranian gunboats, mistook the jetliner for an Iranian
F-14 fighter.
   On Wednesday, the U.S. destroyer John Hancock had a routine
radio exchange with an Iranian jet fighter but did not contanct an
Iran Air passenger jet flying a few miles away.
   An Iran Air spokesman confirmed the arrival in Dubai of Flight
657 on a scheduled flight late Wednesday morning from Shiraz, and
said it returned to the central Iranian city after refueling and
taking on passengers.
   It flew within several miles of the John Hancock, which was off
the United Arab Emirates and in radio contact with many commercial
aircraft in the Dubai air corridor.
   Monitoring of radio traffic showed Dubai air controllers in
constant touch with an Iran Air jet as it approached for landing,
but the John Hancock made no attempt to establish contact.
   John Hancock crewmen were, however, wary of some other aircraft,
including an Iranian warplane whose type was unclear in the noisy
radio chatter.
   The John Hancock asked politely for its name and intention, and
the Iranian pilot responded in English that he was ``making routine
daily check flight.''
   A tense moment came when the destroyer challenged a helicopter
approaching from the direction of Iran through the haze of a
sandstorm that reduced visibility to a few miles.
   Its request for identification went unanswered and the John
Hancock assumed a heightened state of readiness, ordering other
aircraft in the area away and locking its weapons on the
helicopter, which approached to within five miles.
   Radio contact finally was established with the chopper, which
was chartered by an NBC news team.
   An officer of the John Hancock was heard saying: ``Be advised,
sir, we did pass two warnings to you. The direction of your
approach and the flight profile you exhibited did cause us to lock
you up with weapons. Request you guard this frequency more closely
in future.''
   The pilot, who has flown the gulf for more than a year, replied:
``I am on this frequency from the time I leave Dubai and never take
it off. I am afraid your transmissions weren't heard.''

<TEXT>
   A woman who eight years ago told police
two men shot her husband and then raped her has been arrested and
charged with murder in the shooting, officials said.
   Police took Jane Walker Johnson, 30, of Chattanooga into custody
Tuesday and charged her with first-degree murder in the 1980 death
of her husband, Gary Gene Walker, District Attorney Bill Pope said.
   She remained in the Grundy County Jail pending her arraignment
Friday before a Circuit Court judge, Pope said Wednesday.
   Walker, 25, an auto supply salesman, was killed along a road in
Grundy County on Jan. 3, 1980, while making deliveries in a company
van. He was shot three times as he sat in the van, police said.
   Walker's wife told investigators she became sick while riding in
her husband's delivery van, and he pulled over to the side of the
road, where two men attacked the couple.
   Ms. Johnson told police the men shot her husband, then abducted
her. She said she was beaten and raped before they released her on
Interstate 75 in Catoosa County, Ga., police said.
   At the time of the slaying, an auto parts company offered a
$10,000 reward for information about the killing, and police in two
states searched for the men described by the woman as her attackers.

   Here, at a glance, are the candidates in
Mexico's presidential election:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the National Democratic Front _ A senator
and immediate past governor of Michoacan state for the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, Cardenas, 54, last year led a
dissident movement to make the party more democratic and force
changes in the country's economic policy. The son of the late
President Lazaro Cardenas, he has advocated stopping crude oil
exports and using it to produce petrochemicals, suspending payments
on the $104 billion foreign debt while it is renegotiated and
recovering some of the state-owned companies the government has
been selling.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Manuel J. Clouthier of the National Action Party _ A 54-year-old
affluent business leader and rancher from the northwestern state of
Sinaloa, he is running for the National Action Party. He supports
private enterprise, more government austerity, greater foreign
investment and allowing campesinos to own land they currently can
use and pass on to their children, but not sell. National Action,
known as PAN, is the largest opposition party and for years was the
only significant opposition.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Rosario Ibarra De Piedra of the Revolutionary Workers Party _
She is a candidate for a second time of the Revolutionary Workers
Party, the most radical of the parties, but not a party member. She
created a human rights organization after her son disappeared
following his arrest in 1975. Mrs. Piedra, 61, advocates better
salaries, a Latin American front on the foreign debt and freedom of
expression and assembly.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Gumersindo Magana Negrete of the Mexican Democratic Party _ A
48-year-old lawyer, he is candidate of the Mexican Democratic
Party. The party describes itself as inspired by a social Christian
philosophy that supports neither Communism nor capitalism ``without
a social dimension.'' Magana was long active in the conservative
Catholic Sinarquista movement. He advocates formation of a Latin
American debtors' club to pressure for better terms and the
transfer of the debt held by private banks to governments so that
it can be negotiated politically.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Carlos Salinas De Gortari of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party _ A 40-year-old Harvard-educated economist, he has a long
career in government. As budget secretary for President Miguel de
la Madrid until he became candidate for the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, he was responsible for the austerity policy
used during the country's 6-year-long economic crisis. The party
has not lost a major election since it was founded in 1929. He has
pledged to modernize the country economically and politically, end
inflation, stabilize workers' buying power and accept victories by
other political parties.

<HEAD>Shiite Group Threatens U.S. Hostages Over Iran Jet Downing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shadowy Shiite Moslem group implied
today that it will use two American hostages it holds to avenge a
U.S. warship's downing of an Iranian airliner.
   In a typewritten statement in Arabic, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization said the hostages will ``be part of a comprehensive
response that will make the killers and their partners pay the
price.''
   The statement said ``everybody knows that all the strong cards
are still in our hands, including the hostages' issue.''
   On Sunday, the USS Vincennes shot down an Iran Air jet over the
Persian Gulf. Iran said all 290 aboard were killed and vowed to
avenge the deaths. The Pentagon said the Vincennes' crew mistook
the Airbus A300 for an F-14 jet fighter.
   Today's statement was delivered to the offices of a Western news
agency in Moslem west Beirut accompanied by a photocopy of one of
the pages of American hostage Edward Austin Tracy's passport,
apparently to prove its authenticity.
   The photocopy was of a page that includes Tracy's photograph.
   The group, which apparently comprises pro-Iranian extremists,
has claimed the abduction of Tracy, 58, a writer of children's
books, and another Joseph James Cicippio, 57, acting controller at
the American University of Beirut.
   Both were abducted in the fall of 1986.
   Cicippio, of Valley Forge, Pa., and Tracy, of Burlington, Vt.,
are among nine Americans and nine other foreigners held hostage by
various groups in Lebanon. The longest held is 40-year-old Terry A.
Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio.
   Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by factions loyal to
Hezbollah, or Party of God, a pro-Iranian Shiite group. The
relationship between the Revolutionary Justice Organization and
Hezbollah is unclear.
   The organization has threatened Cicippio and Tracy before.
   On April 24, six days after U.S. warships disabled two Iranian
frigates and sank or disabled four other armed Iranian vessels in
the Persian Gulf, the organization said it would kill the two men.

<HEAD>Southern Haylift To Reach `Yankee Friends' Today</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern farmers sent more than 1,500 bales of hay to the
drought-stricken Midwest, saying they hadn't forgotten their
``Yankee friends,'' while marijuana growers in Ohio dug water pits
to keep their million-dollar weeds wet.
   Farmers of legal crops in Ohio hoped to receive 1,000 bales of
hay today, courtesy of North Carolina farmers returning a favor
paid to them two years ago.
   And for the first time in weeks, barges were not stalled on the
drought-shoaled Mississppi River.
   ``We're glad to show our Yankee friends we haven't forgotten
them,'' Jim Graham, North Carolina's commissioner of agriculture,
said Wednesday after he threw a bale of hay onto a tractor-trailer.
   ``This is a good will effort on our part to reciprocate for what
they did for us two years ago,'' Graham said. ``We're paying them
back.''
   Ohio was one of several Midwestern states that came to the aid
of Southern farmers during the drought of 1986. This year, the
Midwest has been suffering from what has been called the worst
drought in 50 years.
   Also on Wednesday, a livestock truck loaded with about 450 bales
of hay donated by Burlington, N.C., farmers departed for Kentucky
from the Piedmont Livestock Co.
   In Oklahoma, six Burlington Northern rail cars filled with 172
tons of donated hay left for South Dakota. Organizer Larry Jones
said the hay should arrive July 13, and that more was being shipped
from Mississippi and Texas.
   Wednesday was another scorcher for the Midwest, where dozens of
record high temperatures were set, according to the National
Weather Service. International Falls, Minn., sometimes called the
nation's icebox, tied its all-time record high with 98 degrees.
Flint, Mich., reached 101 degrees, the second time this year the
all-time record _ set on the Aug. 24, 1947 _ was tied.
   In the New Orleans area, thousands of people bought bottled
drinking water because the drought has allowed salt water to push
up the Mississippi from the gulf.
   ``I have a dog that refuses to drink it. It's salty, very
salty,'' Shirley Ellard said of water drawn at Port Sulphur, about
midway between the mouth of the river and New Orleans.
   On the Mississippi River, the drought has lowered water levels,
forcing barge traffic into the man-made 243-mile-long
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, which ends at Mobile.
   In Kentucky, barges and tows were moving through the channel
near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.
   On the Ohio River, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers team surveyed
the shallow channel in Ballard County on Wednesday to determine
whether it should be closed again for dredging, said Petty Officer
3rd Class John Moss of the U.S. Coast Guard.
   ``It may be necessary to close the channel for one or two days
later this week,'' Moss said.
 , there was no backlog of tow boats and
barges waiting to pass through the channel near the confluence of
the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, Moss said. It marked the first
time since the channel reopened Sunday that the boats did not have
to wait in line.
   Meanwhile, the drought was showing no favoritism among Ohio
crops _ wilting corn and soybeans as well as young Christmas trees
and marijuana plants.
   The drought killed all 2,500 Christmas tree seedlings in Clinton
County that Don Chafin planted this year at his farm in southwest
Ohio.
   In nearby Ross County, Sheriff Thomas Hamman said marijuana
needs as much water as other crops, and growers ``are going to have
to water it by hand,'' or create an irrigation system.
   ``The people that grow the million-dollar crop will take a lot
more care of their plants,'' said Mike Webb of the Ohio attorney
general's office.
   Some growers have dug water pits, usually lined with plastic,
and haul water from the pits to the illegal plants, he said.
   Authorities aren't offering any relief to the pot growers,
however. Officers began their marijuana eradication program earlier
than usual this year because of the drought.

   Prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today and
the dollar slipped.
   Dealers attributed the yen's rise to fears that the U.S. trade
deficit may grow and Japanese official statements against letting
the dollar appreciate further.
   The dollar closed at 132.40 yen, down 1.13 yen from Wednesday's
close. Its high for the day was 132.98 yen and its low was 131.65.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues lost 38.47 points or 0.13 percent to move to
27,728.13. It had gained 189.43 points Wednesday on near-record
trading volume of 2.8 billion. Today's volume was 2 billion shares.
   A broker for Vickers da Costa, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said concerns about U.S. trade figures to be released
next week put pressure on the dollar.
   He also said there was more confidence in the market after
Japanese officials said they wouldn't let the dollar appreciate
much more.
   ``If the dollar gets much stronger, you could well see
intervention,'' he said.
   An exchange dealer at the Bank of Tokyo said the market's mood
was bearish toward the dollar amid relatively quiet trading.
   ``The exchange rates are moving toward adjustment,'' said the
dealer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar hit 134.85 yen Monday, its highest closing rate since
Nov. 24. It had risen rapidly by nearly 10 yen in the previous
three weeks.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ Mexico forms the southern part of North America,
connecting the Central American isthmus with the bulk of the
continent. It shares a 2,062-mile border with the United States
defined by the 1848 Treaty of Hidalgo, in which Mexico gave up half
its territory for $15 million. Guatemala and Belize border Mexico
to the southeast. There are 31 states and the Federal District, the
core area of the Mexico City metropolitan area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   POPULATION _ Mexico has 80 million people, 20 million of whom
live in the Mexico City metropolitan area. About 55 percent of
Mexicans are of Spanish-Indian heritage; 29 percent are Indian; and
10 percent Caucasian. More than 90 percent of Mexicans are Roman
Catholic. Spanish is the official language.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GOVERNMENT _ The government, a federal republic, is headed by
President Miguel de la Madrid, 53. A member of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, he became president Dec. 1, 1982 and
his term ends on Nov. 30. The power of the Mexican presidency
overshadows Mexico's judiciary and legislature. All 44 members of
the Senate belong to the PRI. An electoral reform law provides for
the number of seats reserved for opposition parties to expand from
100 to 150 in the Chamber of Deputies, which is increasing this
year to 500 members.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Mexico has a mixed economy with the government holding
several key industries. It is heavily dependent on oil, the primary
source of revenues needed to pay its $104 billion foreign debt, the
developing world's second-highest. Oil exports earned $7.9 billion
in 1987. Inflation reached a record 159.2 percent last year, and
the government froze wages, prices and the peso-dollar exchange
rate to bring it under control. Inflation was 32.4 percent between
January and April.

   Baby, the eight-foot Burmese python
missing for three months, has been found, much to the shock of a
new tenant in the apartment that Baby's owner had vacated.
   ``I guess (she) opened up the drawer to do something and thereal control
officer Paul Ranes said
Wednesday.
   Ranes answered the call and was greeted by two shaken women.
   Baby was a bit more calm.
   ``It just looked at me,'' Ranes said. ``It didn't do anything.''
   It took police several hours to track down Baby's owner, Molly
McCoy.
   It all began in April, shortly after McCoy's boyfriend gave her
the python as an Easter gift. The snake was given the run of the
apartment while McCoy arranged to have a 100-gallon custom tank
built for the snake. But Baby vanished.
   Animal experts scoured the apartment, but they found no trace of
the 60-pound snake. They guessed that Baby had slithered down the
toilet or found her way under some cupboards and into the walls.
   For days, police answered calls from mothers who were afraid to
let their children outside.
   Officer Mark Forsyth said the mothers had little to fear because
anything larger than a poodle is probably not on a python's menu.
   After a while, McCoy gave up Baby for lost and moved out of the
complex in early May.
   Police said Wednesday the python had not eaten in four or five
months.
   McCoy finally retrieved her pet, but the reunion was subdued.
McCoy remarked that Baby was thin and told reporters that she might
try to sell her to a breeder.

   Officials from the towns of Ashford and
Willington couldn't see the boundary markers for the trees, but are
still hoping to ``walk the line'' to settle a longstanding border
dispute once fall arrives.
   Officials of the rural northeastern Connecticut towns decided to
resort to the method used for centuries by New England farmers to
re-establish property lines each spring after being told that an
engineer's survey of the 20 acres of disputed land would cost about
$40,000.
   They tried Wendesday night, but had to abandon the effort when
they discovered heavy woods made it too difficult to get their
bearings.
   ``If we're going to actually do any walking, we've decided we
have to do it when there aren't any leaves on the trees, because
it's just too hard to see anything at all,'' said Ashford First
Selectwoman Paula Faulkner.
   The officials did locate one of the key markers during their
abbreviated walk Wednesday night. They expect to continue the
exercise in September or October, said Willington First Selectman
Carlton Csiki.
   ``It's a country problem, we're country people and we'll most
likely resolve it in a country fashion,'' he said.

   Neither the Federal Electoral Commission nor any of the parties
had released any results when Jorge de la Vega Dominguez, president
of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, announced ``a crushing,
legal and incontestable victory'' for Carlos Salinas de Gortari
shortly after 1:30 a.m. The party has ruled Mexico since 1929.
   Moments after the victory claim, Interior Secretary Manuel
Bartlett went on national television to reject allegations of vote
fraud.
   A few hours earlier, the three leading opposition presidential
candidates met with federal officials and issued a statement
accusing the government of rigging the election.
   One witness to the voting Wednesday said she saw an 8-year-old
boy cast a ballot. People were also seen voting for their whole
families and election workers were said to be stuffing ballot boxes.
   ``The election day that just ended represented a civic awakening
of the Mexican people'' that the government has quashed by rigging
the vote, the opposition candidates said.
   The statement accuses the government of stuffing ballot boxes,
eliminating citizens from voting rolls, paying people to vote and
multiple voting.
   It says the irregularities ``seriously affect the cleanliness of
today's balloting'' and ``could annul the results unless the
problems are satisfactorily resolved.''
   Rosario Ibarra de Piedra of the radical Revolutionary Workers
Party read the statement, as fellow candidates Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
of the leftist National Democratic Front and Manuel J. Clouthier of
the conservative National Action Party stood by.
   Most polls closed at 6 p.m. (8 p.m. EDT) Wednesday and the
election commission had said partial returns would be available
four hours later.
   By early today, however, no results or turnout had been released
and officials said computer trouble was to blame.
   The election Wednesday was not only for president. Voters also
elected a new 500-member Chamber of Deputies and a 64-member Senate.
   Opposition parties were expected to gain in the congress, which
over the last few years has begun to shed its image of being a
rubberstamp to the executive.
   Since its founding 1929, Mexico's governing party, known as the
PRI, has won every presidential election and has controlled the
national congress and the governorships of all 31 states.
   But this year, a clear deterioration of the PRI's influence was
evidenced by the strong campaigns waged by Cardenas and Clouthier.
   In 1982, President Miguel de la Madrid won 70 percent of the
vote. This year, the victory margin was not expected to be as wide
for Salinas de Gortari.
   De la Madrid's six-year term expires Dec. 1 and under the
constitution he cannot be re-elected.
   Fraud was reportedly widespread in Salinas de Gortari's adopted
home town of Agualeguas, about 80 miles north of Monterrey near the
U.S. border.
   Petra Hernandez, a report an 8-year-old boy who voted with
his father's voting card.
   She said election officials ``let a lot of people vote for the
whole family. They voted for their wife, their kids, their mom who
couldn't come.''
   ``The president of one precinct also was filling out ballots. I
saw him get up nine times and put ballots in the boxes,'' she said.
   PRI officials denied the reports of fraud in Agualeguas.
   The campaign has not been without bloodshed.
   Gunmen on Saturday killed Francisco Xavier Ovando, a long-time
Cardenas collaborator and strategistion but to Ovando's tenure as Michoacan
attorney general.
During that time, Ovando fought organized crime.
   But Cardenas called the slayings ``a provocation.''
   In recent months, Clouthier's conservative National Action Party
and Cardenas' left-leaning National Democratic Front coalition have
weakened the PRI's popular support.
   For the first time, nearly the entire left unified behind one
candidate, the 54-year-old Cardenas. Late in the campaign, Mexican
Socialist Party candidate Heberto Castillo left the race and threw
Cardenas his support.
   Only Mrs. Piedra's party declined to join.
   Clouthier, a wealthy 54-year-old rancher and businessman, ran on
a free-enteed support among a middle class whose aspirations have
been dashed by the country's 6-year economic crisis.

<HEAD>Trial Adjourned Until Next Week After Witness Fails To Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Because an important witness
failed to appear, a court today adjourned until next week the trial
of a Lebanese man charged with the 1985 TWA hijacking and murder of
a U.S. Navy diver.
   Less than an hour after the trial of Mohammed Ali Hamadi resumed
today, chief judge Heiner Mueckenberger recessed the proceedings
until Wednesday.
   The trial, under heavy security in a specially constructed
prison courtroom, began Tuesday.
   Both of the trial's first two sessions have been cut short,
raising prospects the proceedings could extend into next year.
Already, officials have scheduled court days into December and say
more could be added.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial for murder and air
piracy in the June 1985 TWA hijacking. During the ordeal, 39
Americans were held hostage 17 days and U.S. Navy diver Robert
Stethem of Waldorf, Md., was murdered after gunmen forced the
Athens to Rome flight to land in Beirut.
   Mueckenberger said he was adjourning the trial because a witness
who knew Hamadi during his previous stay in West Germany was unable
to come to today's session.
   The man, a social worker, originally had been scheduled to
testify next Wednesday but was later asked by the court to appear
today.
   Tuesday's opening session was also quickly suspended after
Hamadi refused to participate in the proceedings.
   Before adjourning today, the court heard a document from a court
in the southern West German state of Saarland, which convicted
Hamadi of theft and causing bodily injury and gave him a suspended
nine-month sentence in 1983. Hamadi lived in Saarland from 1982 to
1984.
   The document listed Hamadi's date of birth as June 13, 1964.
Hamadi also has claimed he was born in 1966.
   The issue of age is important because it will determine the
length of any sentence Hamadi receives if convicted. The range is
from 15 years to life.
   Before hearing evidence on the chrgaes, the court must first
determine whether Hamadi should be tried as a juvenile, young adult
or adult. Under West German law, a juvenile is under 18, an adult
is 21 and older, and a young adult is between 18 and 21.
   The United States tried unsuccessfully to have Hamadi extradited
to stand trial on its soil.
   Tuesday's hearing was recessed three times because of various
legal disputes and Hamadi's objection to the choice of an
entepreter.
   Hamadi, in his only statements to the court, gave his name and
asked for a new interpreter and replacement of one of his defense
lawyers. Hamadi said the interpreter was not qualified in his
Arabic dialect.
   The murdered diver's parents, Richard and Pir son's brutal murder was
read.
   Hamadi was arrested at Frankfurt airport on Jan. 13, 1987, after
he was found to be carrying liquid explosives.
   A Duesseldorf court sentenced his older brother, Abbas Ali
Hamadi, to 13 years in prison last April for kidnapping two West
Germans in Beirut in an attempt to gain freedom for his brother.
   One was later released, but the second is still being held in
Beirut by a radical Shiite group.

   Showta today as
scattered thunderstorms fell from the central High Plains to New
Mexico.
   But a high-pressure system anchored over the lower Ohio Valley
kept skies mostly clear from the parched Plains to the East Coast.
   The rain fell over western and central North Carolina, and from
extreme western Nebraska and eastern Colorado to central and
southern New Mexico. Golf-ball size hail fell in Sutherland, Neb.
   Spotty showers fell along the Gulf Coast, scattered showers fell
along the central New England coast and thunderstorms were
clustered over extreme southern Florida.
   On Wednesday night, North Dakota thunderstorms dropped
baseball-size hail on Dickinson, while in Glen Ullin small hail and
gusty winds accompanied more than an inch of rain in less than an
hour.
   In Montana, thunderstorms dropped up to 3 inches of rain and
generated strong, gusty winds that broke windows and leveled a barn
near Ekalaka. Winds gusted to nearly 60 mph in Pueblo, Colo.
   The hot weather baking the Midwest spread into the Northeast on
Wednesday, as temperature records for July 6 up to 114 years old
were broken in 30 cities and tied in seven.
   The epic drought continued to plague much of the nation. Severe
to extreme drought conditions exist in much of California, sections
of Nevada, Oregon and Washington, the northern Plains, the upper
half of the Mississippi Valley, the lower Missouri Valley, much of
the Great Lakes region and the lower Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
   Although much-needed rain fell across the Plains late last week,
it only put a small dent in the dry spell. Parts of the northern
Rockies, the northern Plains, the Mississippi and lower Missouri
valleys, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and the Gulf Coast have had
less than 75 percent normal rainfall.
   The worst-hit aras are the middle and lower Mississippi Valley,
the western lower Ohio Valley and the Tennessee Valley, where
rainfall has been less than half normal.
   No relief is in sight in the forecast for the next six to 10
days. Below-normal rainfall is expected for much of the nation,
with above-normal precipitation expected only along the central
Gulf Coast.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
in northern Minnesota, the Great Plains, the southern Rockies, the
lower Mississippi Valley, Florida and the northern Atlantic Coast
states, with rain heaviest in Louisiana, southeast Texas and
southern Florida; hazy skies from New England to the Great Lakes;
and sunny skies prevailing in the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 80s or 90s in most
of the nation; near records of 95 to 100 degrees in the Great
Lakes; 100 to 110 degrees in the desert Southwest and California's
inland valleys; and in the 70s across parts of Montana, northern
Idaho and Washington state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., to 97 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

   A misfired mortar shell exploded among
a platoon of Marines at the Army's training area here, killing two
and injuring 15, a Marine spokesman said.
   The platoon of about 30 Marines was conducting live fire
exercises with 60mm shells at about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday when the
mortar round accidently landed among the group, said Maj. Kerry K.
Gershaneck, the public affairs officer at the Kaneohe Marine Corps
Air Station on Oahu.
   The injured were treated Wednesday night at medical facilities
at Pohakuloa Training Area, located on Hawaii Island, and at Hilo
and Kona hospital, where they were taken by a military helicopter,
Gershaneck said.
   Two of the injured Marines were in serious condition, he said.
   Three Marines were taken to Hilo hospital, where officials
declined to discuss their conditions, referring questions to the
military.
   Nine Marines were taken to Kona Hospital where Nursing
Supervisor Patty Haupert said ``most are what they call `walking
wounded.' We're mostly looking at stray shrapnel wounds.''
   She said there was no immediate determination of their
conditions.
   The names of the dead and injured were withheld, pending
notification of families.
   Just how the mortar happened to land among the Marines
``probably will not come out until after the investigation,'' said
William E. Buck, the deputy public affairs officer.
   The platoon was part of the Marine 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine
Regiment stationed at Kaneohe. The battalion of more than 800
Marines is halfway through a monthlong training exercise at
Pohakuloa, Gershaneck said.

<TEXT>
   Disasters have been a fixture in the
North Sea since its oil boom began in the 1960s, and oilmen regard
the shallow, storm-swept waters as among the world's most hazardous
petroleum fields.
   Explosions, structural defects on rigs and bad weather all have
contributed to the regular tragedies that plague the region.
   The worst North Sea oil field disaster was in 1980, when 137
crewmen on the accommodation platform Alexander I. Kielland died as
it capsized in storms in the Norwegian Ekofisk area. Most of the
dead were Norwegians.
   Five years earlier, a ruptured pipeline on the same rig caused
an explosion that killed three men.
   The first North Sea spill was in April 1977, when at least 5.8
million gallons of oil escaped into the sea from the oil rig Bravo
in the Ekofisk field run by Phillips Petroleum.
   Texas oilman Red Adair was brought in to cap the fracture. It
took him and his team five attempts to cap the rig, but not before
a slick covered 1,500 square miles.
   In November 1965, three people died and 11 others were injured
when an explosion ripped the bottom out of a North Sea oil drilling
barge at Teesport near Middlesbrough in northeast England.
   In December 1965, 13 men died when the Sea Gem rig collapsed and
sank.
   In November 1981, the Transworld 58 platform was torn from its
moorings and drifted for several hours in hurricane winds.
Forty-four men were evacuated but another 20 remained trapped
aboard the platform for several hours before being rescued. There
were no casualties.
   In 1982, one man was killed on the same Piper Alpha platform
involved in Wednesday's disaster when a walkway collapsed.
   In 1984, a fire on the production platform Brent Bravo killed
three workers when they were trapped in a shaft.
   In 1985, two maintenance workers died in an explosion in the
semi-submersible rig Glomar Arctic II.
   Last March, a total of 40 workers were winched by helicopter
from two rigs that got into trouble in gales. The same night,
another rig drifted off the Norwegian coast with 77 men aboard.
   Last Friday, an explosion occurred at British Petroleum's Sullom
Voe North Sea oil terminal on the Shetland Islands, but no injuries
were reported.
   On Tuesday, fire broke out on the North Sea Brent Alpha
platform. Again, no injuries were reported.
   The Department of Energy said a total of 123 fixed
installations, including the Piper Alpha platform involved in
Wednesday night's disaster, are currently in the British sector of
the North Sea oil field.
   The department said there are additionally about 40
semi-submersible rigs and jack-up rigs in the British sector.
   Semi-submersible rigs float and can travel under their own
power, while four-legged jack-up rigs stand on the sea bottom and
are generally used for exploration in shallower waters.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Captain Says Pot Ship Crew Destroyed Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of a Panamanian-registered vessel
carrying more than 72 tons of marijuana stalled a U.S. Coast Guard
boarding party as long as possible to destroy records, said the
captain of the Coast Guard cutter.
   The converted oil-rig supply ship Encounter Bay was towed into
Seattle by the Coast Guard cutter Boutwell and placed under tight
security Wednesday. The street value of the cargo was estimated by
the Coast Guard at $280 million.
   The Encounter Bay seemed to be heading for the Strait of Juan de
Fuca, the entry to Puget Sound and the main channel to Victoria and
Vancouver, British Columbia, said Cecil Allison, captain of the
Boutwell.
   The Boutwell's crew could read the word Panama in obscured
letters, and a few hours later, those aboard the 378-foot cutter
had permission from the Panamanian embassy to board the Encounter
Bay, Allison said.
   The Encounter Bay's crew yielded to a boarding party only after
the Boutwell fired machine guns at its rudder and engine room and
threatened to use cannon fire, Allison said.
   ``In my opinion,'' he said, the Encounter Bay captain ``was just
trying to prolong the engagement so he could destroy all the
records he could.
   ``It was a very organized operation, from the packaging all the
way through to the control of the ship and the cleaning out of the
boat's records.''
   Allison said they found no records indicating the origin or
destination of the vessel or who was in charge of the operation.
   The 180-foot Encounter Bay was not flying a flag when it was
spotted late last week about 600 miles offshore.
   The owner of the Encounter Bay was listed as Countess Shipping
Corp. of Panama, and the 18-member crew included three Americans,
one from England, one from New Zealand and 13 from Indonesia,
Thailand and Singapore.
   Sixteen appeared Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate John Weinberg
and were advised of their rights and possible charges against them,
and two others were to appear for the same purpose today when a
Thai interpreter would be available.
   All are held in custody pending a detention hearing on Monday,
when bail, if any, will be set, said deputy clerk Karen Lamborn.
The magistrate at that time would try to determine whether there
was probable cause to send the case to a grand jury, she said.
   If it can be proved the ship was headed for the United States,
crew members could prison terms of a few
years to life, said Gary Liming, U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration special agent-in-charge.
   The Encounter Bay's crew was cooperative but not talkative,
Allison said. He estimated there was 72 tons of high-grade
marijuana on board in about 8,000 ``bales'' packed into four large
shipping containers.
   Each ``bale,'' in a blue nylon sack, contained eight packets of
marijuana vacuum-sealed in double plastic wrappings.

   The dollar fell against major currencies in
moderate trading in Europe today. Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said hectic dealings in East Asia had
calmed down before European markets opened and had not affected
dollar exchange levels.
   Investors in Japan were switching to Japanese yen in a flurry of
buying, dealers said.
   With the dollar trading in Europe at 1.80 West German marks to
1.83 West German marks, dealers said they did not expect much to
happen as the American currency was comfortable at that level. But
they said if the dollar moved higher than that, the central banks
were likely to intervene and sell dollars to bring exchange rates
back down.
   Italian markets reported currency dealing was very active with
many large commercial orders.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell to a closing 132.40 Japanese yen from 133.53 yen at
Wednesday's close. In London later, the dollar was trading lower at
131.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _ 1.8162 West German marks, down from 1.8217
   _ 1.5090 Sw5135
   _ 6.1135 French francs, down from 6.1315
   _ 2.0481 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0515
   _ 1,347.00 Italian lire, down from 1,351.75
   _ 1.2050 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2168
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7190, more expensive for
buyers than Wednesday's late $1.7130.
   Gold opened in London at $438.75 an ounce, up from $436.75 bid
late Wednesday. At mid-morning, the city's five major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $439.15.
   London bullion dealers described trading as moribund, blaming
uncertainty about inflation and the unlikelihood of much change in
dollar exchange rates.
   In Zurich, gold opened at $438.50 bid, up from Wednesday's late
$437.50. At noon the price had moved higher to $438.90 bid.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed higher at $441.62 bid, up from
$441.05 late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid $6.94 a troy ounce, up
from $6.77 late Wednesday.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former secretary to Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita today joined the list of top political aides who
reportedly made questionable stock dealings in a scandal spreading
through the ranks of business and politics.
   In related developments, the president of Japan's leading
economic newspaper and the chairman of the company whose stock was
involved in the dealings resigned because of the scandal.
   Takeshita told reporters today that one of his former
secretaries, Ihei Aoki, earned profits by trading the shares of the
real estate company Recruit-Cosmoined shares from the company then sold
them
shortly after it went public in 1986, when Takeshita was finance
minister.
   The dealings were not illegal, but the revelations were on the
front pages of almost all Japanese newspapers today and critics
said the case highlights questionable ethics in the links between
Japan's politicians and businessmen.
   Takeshita did not elaborate on the number of shares Aoki traded
or his profits from the deal, but acknowledged that the scandal
would seriously affect the upcoming session of the Diet, Japan's
parliament.
   He said he would not take responsibility for his aide's action.
   The controversy surfaced last month as a bribery case in a local
government, but has entered a new dimension with a series of
revelations that aides to leaders of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party profited with Recruit-Cosmos stock.
   According to reports in the Japanese press, Recruit-Cosmos gave
stock or sold it at an artificially low price to high-ranking
politicians. In some instances, the company reportedly lent money
to politicians to buy the shares.
   When the company went public and the stock price soared, the
politicians were able to reap large profits from a neglible initial
investment.
   It was not clear what, if anything, the politicians did for
Recruit-Cosmos in return.
   Not only politicians are involved in the scandal.
   The president of Japan's leading economic daily, Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, resigned Wednesday after it was revealed that he, Ko
Morita, had dealt in Recruit-Cosmos shares, violating the rules of
his newspaper.
   Hiromasa Ezoe, chairman of Recruit-Cosmos and its parent company
Recruit Ltd., a giant information service company, announced that
he will resign the two chairmanships.
   The president of Recruit, Naotaka Ida, said Ezoe will also
withdraw from the government's tax commission.
   So far, the scandal has touched aides to Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa; former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone; Liberal
Democratic Party Secretary General and former Foreign Minister
Shintaro Abe; former Defense Agency Director General Koichi Kato;
and Michio Watanabe, the former minister of international trade and
industry.
   Of them, only Miyazawa has denied knowing of the stock deals,
while the others said they had become aware their aides had
received the stock and made profits.
   Saburo Tsukamoto, chairman of Democratic Socialist Party, the
third largest opposition party, was also found in the list of
people who gained about $200,000 through the transactions.
   ``Whether they are politicians or company heads, those who have
responsibilities must behave prudently not to be criticized by the
general public,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi told a press
conference today in the only official comment from the government
on the matter.
   Critics jumped on the case as an example of loose ethics in
Japanese political life.
   ``Politicians want as much money as they can get, and
businessmen always look for connections with politicians,'' said
Shinji Otsuki, an editorial writer for Asahi Shimbun, a major
Japanese daily.
   He said the scandal will fuel public opposition to the tax
reform package that the Takeshita government hopes to get through
the special Diet session later this month.
   ``The Japanese public won't tolerate watching politicians earn
huge profits by taking favors from businessmen in tricky ways very
close to insider trading,'' Otsuki said.
   Legislation to ban insider trading took effect only in 1987, but
is not retroactive.
  giving politicians stock shares that are
guaranteed to rise.
   ``The only problem in this case, if there is any, is that the
amount of money involved was unusually substantive and people who
profited by the dealings were in positions where they are not
supposed to be involved in such actions for ethical reasons,'' he
said.

   A blind woman who was removed from an airplane in
a dispute over seating and safety instructions says she wral rules may
not prevent other blind people from
being harassed.
   ``When I walk in an airport, I don't know what's going to
happen, but I know that it's likely to be demeaning and
humiliating,'' Peggy Pinder, an officer of the National Federation
of the Blind, said Wednesday at the federation's annual meeting.
   The U.S. Transportation Department has proposed nine rules to
end airline discrimination against disabled people. The rules were
outlined at the conference by Matthew Scocozza, the department's
assistant secretary for policy.
   But Ms. Pinder challenged Scocozza, saying a clause in one of
the rules could make it possible for airlines to continue barring
blind passengers from sitting in emergency exit rows _ a practice
the federation has criticized as discriminatory.
   Under one proposed rule, no passenger could be required to sit
in a certain area of the plane, ``except where required by an FAA
(Federal Aviation Administration) safety rule,'' Scocozza told a
predominantly blind audience of more than 1,000.
   Scocozza said in a speech to the convention that he agreed with
the federation's position that many blind people are capable of
sitting in an exit row and handling an emergency situation.
   But United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins said his airline does
not seat blind passengers in an exit row because of fears they
could not assess an emergency situation as well as a sighted person.
   ``Let's say there's a fire on the other side (of the door), a
blind person wouldn't be able to see that,'' Hopkins said.
   In April, James Gashel, an officer of the federation, was taken
into custody on a charge of criminal trespass after he refused to
leave his seat in an emergency exit row of an United flight.
   Ms. Pinder said she was removed from a Midway Airlines plane on
March 31 and arrested because she refused to move from a seat in
the smoking section to the front of the plane.
   But Sandra Allen, a spokeswoman for Midway, said Ms. Pinder was
arrested because she refused to listen to a special safety briefing
the airline requires for all disabled passengers.
   The federation's executive director, Kenneth Jernigan, told the
convention that, ``no blind person anywhere in the country can
board a plane without fear of harassment, public humiliation and
possibly arrest and bodily injury.''
   Scocozza said the department's new rules may help to change that
situation.
   ``If nothing else, it's a start that's 30 years too late,'' he
said.

   Mayor Teddy Kollek said today that the first
firebomb attack in Jewish west Jerusalem since the Arab uprising
began signals a dangerous escalation of anti-Israeli violence.
   Arab assailants hurled two firebombs Wednesday at an Israeli bus
in west Jerusalem's busy commercial district. Police said there
were no casualties.
   Although stone throwing and firebomb attacks have escalated
recently in east Jerusalem, where 135,000 Arabs live, the attack
Wednesday was the first time the violence has spread into Jewish
west Jerusalem.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the firebombing showed that
the Arab uprising is a serious threat.
   ``This is additional evidence that all this struggle, this
uprising, is not about territorial issues but is about the very
existence of Israel,'' Shamir told Israel radio.
   Also Wednesday, a brick was dropped from the roof of a
commercial building in one of the most crowded areas of Tel Aviv,
striking the roof of a car on the street below.
   Kollek described the firebombing as ``a terrible danger for the
present and the future.''
   ``I think the assailants wanted to prove that in Jerusalem,
where life is relatively good compared with the territories,
especially here they are in control,'' Kollek said on Israel radio.
   Deputy Police Chief Rahamin Comfort told the radio the attack
``was a very severe incident. It has great importance because until
now we did not have such a case.''
   After the attack at about 10:30 p.m. on Jerusalem's King George
Street, a busy thoroughfare packed witIsraeli passersby drew their guns
and chased the suspects.
   Police rushed to the scene, stopped Arabs to check their
identification cards and rounded up 10 suspects for questioning.
   Witnesses told The Associated Press the firebombs were hurled
from the top of a building under construction and the
gasoline-filled bottles struck the top of a passing bus before
igniting on the street.
   
   The firebomb incident marked only the second time the downtown
area of an Israeli city was targeted for unrest since the uprising
began in December.
   On June 12, Palestinians hurled three firebombs from the roof of
Tel Aviv's main shopping plaza. The attack did not cause injuries
or damage. Police detained several Arab suspects.
   In east Jerusalem, police closed two schools after Arab students
burned tires and hurled rocks at riot police, said police spokesman
Alex Lapidot. One officer was slightly injured by a stone and one
youth was detained, Lapidot said.
   Protesters also stoned two buses, and police arrested 11 Arab
suspects, Lapidot said. In one attack, three Arabs fled into east
Jerusalem's central bus station, and police fired tear gas into the
crowded terminal before capturing the assailants.
   In other developments Wednesday, the army extended for three
days a closure order against all 800 Arabs schools in the West
Bank. Army officials have said the schools, which now will reopen
Monday, are hotbeds of anti-Israeli violence.
   The West Bank's military government ordered Palestinian-run
government hospitals to stop treating casualties of the uprising
free of charge, Arab doctors said Wednesday.
   The hospitals, funded by taxes paid by Palestinians, were
ordered to charge all patients $175 a night and demand payment in
advance for three nights, newspaper reports said.

   Benzene gas leaked from a factory in a
residential part of Shanghai and sickened more than 190 people,
including nine who had to be hospitalized, an official report said
Thursday.
   Most complained of feeling dizzy, weak and short of breath after
the toxic gas spread Wednesday over Shanghai's Shenjiadu
neighborhood, the China Daily said.
   Doctors said the nine taken to the Putuo Central Hospital were
not seriously ill, the paper said.
   About 300 families live in the neighborhood, which is surrounded
by half a dozen chemical factories. The report said a preliminary
investigation pinpointed the Shanghai No. 9 Chemical Fibre Factory
as the likely culprit.
   It said Shenjiadu residents have been complaining about air
pollution for a long time, and the city has agreed to move them
from the area. However, construction of new housing has been slowed
by lack of money, the paper said.
   China's cities are among the most seriously polluted in the
world due to an intermingling of factories and apartment buildings,
frequent lack of emission controls and heavy reliance on coal for
home heating and to run machinery.

<HEAD>Construction Worker Unearths Valuable Medieval Treasure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A construction worker in a southwestern
Polish town uncovered a medieval treasure pot, and other residents
found out and scooped up some of the gold coins, Polish television
reported.
   The 14th century treasure found in Sroda Slaska is worth an
estimated $6.9 million and consists of more than 1,000 gold coins
minted in Prague and Gdansk as well as a gold crown encrusted with
precious stones, the report said.
   The valuables apparently were hidden in the 1340s when the black
plague ravaged Europe, according to the national evening TV news
Wednesday.
   ``What was found in Sroda Slaska could possibly be called the
treasure of the millenium,'' said Tadeusz Kaletyn, director of the
provincial archaeological and renovation center in nearby Wroclaw,
in an interview with Dziennik Ludowy, the peasant party daily
newspaper.
   When the unidentified construction worker's spade struck metal,
he had no idea of the wealth buried beneath him.
   ``At first I thought those were just milk-bottle caps when I
turned them over with my spade,'' the worker said on television.
   The public scramble to pocket the scattered coins caused police
to move in to protect the find, the TV reported.
   Dozens of coins were recovered during a house-to-house search by
police. One person was arrested and two youngsters with precious
coins on them were detained outside a jewelery store in the nearby
city of Wroclaw.
   Police believe that the public still has many pieces of gold and
prosecutors are continuing an investigation to help recover the
valuables for the state treasury, although the most valuable items
have been recovered, Dziennik Ludowy said.
   Authorities say they will reward those who turn in their cache.

   Republican Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire
asserted Thursday that tens of thousands of ``refugees'' are
fleeing neighboring Massachusetts each year to escape the policies
of Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``You ought to stand at the border and talk to them when they
come into New Hampshire,'' Sununu, who is active in Republican
George Bush's presidential campaign, said in remarks at the
National Press Club.
   ``The state of Massachusetts in fact has the reality of between
50,000 and 100,000 leaving the state in the last five or six years.
We in New Hampshire in fact get 10,000 to 20,000 refugees a year
who escape with their families,'' Sununu said.
   Sununu said people are leaving Massachusetts, where the likely
Democratic presidential nominee is governor, because ``they have
perceived mismanagement, they have perceived a propensity to tax,
they're not happy with the quality of service they receive.''
   The New Hampshire governor has been speaking around the country
on Dukakis' record as Massachsuetts governor as part of Bush's
surrogate speaker program.
   ``If Michael Dukakis fulfills his promise to do for the rest of
the nation what he did for Massachusetts, then we are in serious
trouble,'' Sununu asserted, saying Massachsetts ranks low in job
creation.
   ``Massachusetts is also the stolen-car capital of the United
States. I wouldn't run around bragging about that,'' he said.
   On another matter, Sununu said in response to a question that
``there would be a plus to considering a woman'' for the No. 2 spot
on the Republican ticket. He contended that the Democrats have
excluded women from consideration this year on their ticket.
   Sununu said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole and former United Nations Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick as three Republican women who would make outstanding
vice presidents.
   At the same time, Sununu said ``there would be a plus'' to
considering a GOP vice presidential choice from a particular region
of the country _ New England.
   Asked if he were seeking the vice presidential post, or a
Cabinet job in a Bush administration, Sununu said: ``I have a very
short horizon. My horizon now is getting George Bush elected. After
that, I'll get my resume in order.''

<HEAD>Blast Measures 5.6 on Richter Scale, Felt in Las Vegas</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear weapons test rocked the Nevada
desert today, registering 5.6 on the Richter scale and causing a
swaying motion in high-rise buildings here, 100 miles from ground
zero.
   John Minsch, a spokesman for the National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., said the reading indicated the test was
one of the larger ones conducted at the desert site.
   The device was detonated 40 miles from Mercury, a tiny town on
the Nevada Test Site where Soviet nuclear scientists are based
while preparing for a joint U.S.-Soviet test next month.
   A controller in the tower at McCarran International Airport in
Las Vegas said the tower rocked slightly seconds after the blast,
at 8:05 a.m.
   A telephone switchboard operator at Fitzgerald's Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas said a guest on the 29th floor called to ask why
she felt ground motion.
   And a receptionist at the Lionel, Sawyer law firm, atop a
high-rise office building downtown, said she felt a ``dizzy,
swirling feeling'' at the time of the blast. She said a hanging
plant in the office began swaying.
   All three declined to give their names.
   Motion was recorded on Energy Department seismographs atop
several hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown. Motion
was also recorded at Scotty's Castle in Death Valley, Calif., west
of the test site.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.An earthquake or explosion of 3.5 on the Richter scale
can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5
considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
   The test was delayed five minutes while controllers checked out
a malfunctioning signal.
   Energy Department spokesman Chris West said the test appeared to
be normal, with no indications of any problems. West, who was in a
control center 25 miles from ground zero, said monitors at the site
indicated no radiation had escaped the ground.
   He said slight ground motion was felt in the control center.
   Today's test was the eighth conducted this year, and the sixth
conducted with Soviet scientists on site.
   The Soviet scientists arrived earlier this year to begin
preparing for next month's joint verification experiment. The
Soviet scientists will monitor a U.S. test in mid-August and U.S.
scientists will monitor a Soviet test a month later.
   The experiments are designed to determine the ability of each
country to monitor the size of the other's tests. Such monitoring
capabilities are critical in test limitation treaties.
   The DOE had issued a warning to managers of high-rise buildings
in Las Vegas not to have workers in precarious positions at the
time of today's detonation. Such warnings are issued only when the
test is near 150 kilotons, the upper limits allowable under
U.S.-Soviet treaties.
   The nuclear device was buried 2,000 feet beneath the surface of
Pahute Mesa, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The most recent previous test was June 22, when two nuclear
devices were detonated simultaneously in a rare experiment.

<HEAD>Branstad says USDA Clearance Relaxed for Drought-Stricken Counties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa said today that
drought-stricken counties no longer will have to get Agriculture
Department clearance before approving emergency feed programs for
livestock producers.
   Branstad said he was told by Agriculture Secretary Richard E.
Lyng that an official announcement would be made soon. Branstad
disclosed the action to reporters after meeting with Lyng.
   ``The (drought) counties will not have to make application to
get approval here in Washington for the emergency feed and
emergency feed assistance program,'' Branstad said. ``They can just
notify USDA that they will be providing that (assistance) on an
individual farmer-by farmer basis.''
   Branstand said that to qualify, a farmer will have to show the
county office of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service that he has endured at least a 40 percent loss in normal
feed stocks.
   ``This is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of
questions in the country, that are hurting the livestock
producers,'' he said. ``And I think it is a very positive
development.''
   Under the emergency feed program, the USDA pays eligible
livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace
that which is normally produced on the farm. The emergency feed
assistance program allows the sale of USDA-owned grain at reduced
prices _ 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate.
   As of July 6, the feed programs were approved by USDA for 474
counties in 22 states.

<HEAD>Indian High Court Accepts Contempt of Court Petiton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court Thursday agreed to hear
arguments that Union Carbide Corp. had scorned India's judicial
system in the cases stemming from the Bhopal gas disaster,
according to a news report.
   A two-judge panel of the Madhya Pradesh High Court accepted a
petition accusing the Danbury, Conn.-based company of contempt of
court, the Press Trust of India reported.
   A hearing was ordered on the petition, but no date was
announced, the news agency said.
   Union Carbide spokesman Ed Van Den Amelle said the company had
no comment since it had not seen the report.
   The petition is the latest legal entanglement stemming from the
1984 Bhopal gas disaster in which nearly 3,000 people died.
   It alleges that Union Carbide showed contempt for India's court
system by asking District Judge M.W. Deo to excuse himself from
hearing a $3 billion damage suit filed by India against the
company, the news agency said. The company had argued that Deo
showed bias in December when he ordered Union Carbide to make
relief payments to gas victims before a final decision had been
made in the case.
   Deo rejected Union Cabide's request June 16.
   Preliminary hearings in the damage case are under way in Deo's
court in Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh in central India.
   The contempt of court petition was filed last month by Madhya
Pradesh Advocate General A.M. Mathur and accepted Thursday by two
judges in the city of Jabalpur.
   It names Union Carbide, Chairman Robert Kennedy and two Indian
attorneys.
   The government suit stems from the leak of lethal methyl
isocynate gas from a pesticide plant run by a Union Carbide
subsidiary in December 1984.
   India has said the gas leak resulted from negligence. Union
Carbide blames it on sabotage.

<HEAD>Number of Teacher Strikes Unchanged at 87, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public school teachers staged 87 strikes in 14
states in 1987-88, the same number as the year before, a group
opposed to public employee unions said Thursday.
   But there were more teachers involved in the 876 walkouts and
almost three times as many students missed classes, the Public
Service Research Foundation said.
   It said 66,043 teachers went out on strike at some point during
the school year that just ended, and 945,793 students missed
classes.
   It said in 1986-87, there were 87 strikes in a dozen states,
affecting 49,546 teachers and 326,431 students.
   The foundation, part of an organization that opposes collective
bargaining for public employees, published the figures in its
fortnightly newsletter, The Government Union Critique.
   Peter W. Katsirubas, editor of the newsletter, said that if a
school district kept schools open with substitute or non-striking
teachers, students were not counted as missing classes.
   The biggest strike last year was the 19-day walkout by 24,000
teachers in Chicago, affecting 400,000 students. It was the ninth
Chicago strike in the past 19 years. The board of education had
sought to freeze teachers' wages.
   Katsirubas said he tallied 71 teacher strikes in 1985-86 and 100
in 1984-85.
   Teacher union leaders contend there are fewer strikes these days
and many of those that do occur are defensive ones. Teacher
salaries have risen faster than inflation for the past seven years
and the average teacher now earns more than $28,000, the highest
ever in real dollars.

Hispanic Pledge</HEAD>

   Vice President George Bush says he will not
promise to put blacks, women and other minorities in his Cabinet if
elected president, even though he has made that commitment to
Hispanic Americans.
   ``I feel strongly there should be an Hispanic in a Bush
Cabinet,'' the vice president said Wednesday after addressing a
Hispanic convention in Dallas.
   ``Other groups have been represented in the Cabinet and
Hispanics have not,'' said Bush, certain to be the Republican
presidential nominee.
   He said his promise to Hispanics was a one-shot pledge and that
he would not go around the country making promises to special
interest groups.
   On Capitol Hill, a group of Hispanic House members today
denounced Bush's promise to name a Hispanic to his cabinet.
   ``George Bush is making a last-ditch effort to make up for eight
years of Republican neglect,'' said Rep. Albert Bustamante,
D-Texas, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.
   Rep. Matthew Martinez, D-Calif., said he had no confidence in
Bush making a meaningful appointment, saying the problem with the
current administration is who they name to visible government posts.
   ``They are tokens, people who they're able to manipulate and
control. They do not believe in civil rights,'' he said.
   Bustamante said likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, who
also has promised to name Hispanics to high government posts, ``can
back up his statement with his record.''
   Today, Bush invades Dukakis' backyard to woo an ethnic group
close to the heart of the Massachusetts governor. The vice
president will speak in Boston tonight before a Greek Orthodox
diocesean dinner. Aides said he would talk about the importance of
religion.
   Underscoring the political importance of Hispanics, Bush spoke
in Dallas before the convention of the League of United Latin
American Citizens (LULAC), the largest and oldest Hispanic civic
group.
   Although Bush does not speak Spanish, he arranged for his son,
Jeb, to fly in from Florida to make a pitch for him. Jeb Bush, who
speaks Spanish and is married to a woman from Mexico, is popular
with Hispanic groups.
   Pledging to put a Hispanic in his Cabinet, Bush said, it was
``good to acknowledge that some things are, at this point, owed.''
He said his promise was something ``I have never made before, to
anyone, to any group.''
   However, he said, ``It is time. It is time and it's long
overdue, and that is a solemn pledge.''
   Dukakis said Bush's vow to name a Hispanic to the Cabinet was
``about a year too late.'' Dukakis made the same pledge in June
1987 to the LULAC convention, held last year in Corpus Christi,
Texas. Dukakis was to address the group on Thursday, followed by
Jesse Jackson on Friday.
   At a news conference, Bush said he would not make similar
promises to other groups.
   ``I will be very open-minded and broad-based in who I select to
serve in my Cabinet, but I'm addressing myself to righting a wrong
that has been out there for many years.''
   Asked if he would make a similar promise to Asian Americans,
Bush said, ``I'd have to go back there and research that out.''
   Oscar Moran, the Hispanic group's president, said of Bush, ``He
attracted the attention of some voters who already decided on
Dukakis. Now they will pay attention to him.''
   But Tony Bonilla, an influential Democrat whom Bush singled out
by name as a person he had tried to recruit for the GOP, was
unmoved by the vice president's promise to put a Hispanic in the
Cabinet.
   Bonilla said it was ``a little patronizing'' for Bush to make
such a statement after serving eight years in the Reagan
administration without a Hispanic in the inner circle.
   ``The vice president needs to say to the president right now,
`We have goofed. We have not reciprocated to the Hispanic
community''' for their support, said Bonilla, a former chairman of
LULAC and the head of the National Hispanic Leadership Conference.
   Bush said he had discussed the idea of a Hispanic in the Cabinet
with President Reagan, but he added, ``I'm not president of the
United States.''
   His commitment was a measure of the political importance of
Hispanics, particularly in key battleground states like Texas,
California and Florida which have a large Spanish-speaking
population.
   Since 1980, the number of Hispanics in the United States has
increased 30 percent, to 19 million, accounting for about 7.9
percent of the nation's population.
   Urging Hispanics to switch to the Republican Party, Bush said,
``I think you belong with us. And don't let anyone take you, or
your support, for granted.''
   Many people in the audience did not applaud, an indication they
were not swayed by his appeal.

<TEXT>
   Last year's mild El Nino, a puzzling
phenomenon in which global weather disruptions follow a warming of
the Pacific, was predicted by three different climate models,
according to scientists who hope they can now serve distant warning
of future recurrences.
   ``Looking at the results ... we feel there is a good chance of
being able to assess these things as much as a year ahead. And over
time we expect to get better,'' said Stephen Zebiak of the Columbia
University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Laboratory.
   ``Time will show how much value these kinds of models and
predictions can have. Until there is a consensus on that, we don't
expect to see governments taking action readily based on them,
although I do think that eventually that will happen,'' Zebiak said
Thursday in a telephone interview.
   ``It's a new kind of game, really, a lot of people are still
quite skeptical about it.''
   The successful predictions of the 1986-87 El Nino are being
formally reported in Friday's edition of Science magazine.
   El Ninos, still not fully understood, are events that appear to
affect weather around the world. One that occurred in 1982-83,
described as the strongest in this century, was blamed for an
estimated 1,500 deaths and damage of $2 billion to $8 billion
worldwide.
   The 1986-87 El Nino had much less impact, although some unusual
weather was reported, including heavy rains in coastal Peru and
drought in India and the Pacific Northwest of the United States.
   The events are preceded by unusually warm water temperatures in
the Pacific and changes in barometric pressure over that ocean.
   Zebiak said the climate studies currently show cooler than
normal Pacific Ocean temperatures _ the opposite of an El Nino _
for at least the balance of this year. These cold events do not
seem to have the climate impact of the warmer El Ninos, he added.
   El Ninos take their name from the Spanish word for child, a
reference to the Christ Child. This was coined by Peruvian
fishermen to refer to the recurring phenomenon, which sharply
reduced their fish supply and was often first noticed at Christmas
time.
   Scientists, combining that name with a reference to changes in
Pacific and Indian Ocean air pressure, usually use the term ENSO,
for El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
   The three different climate models that predicted the 1986-87 El
Nino were:
   _The Lamont-Doherty model developed by Mark Cane, Zebiak and
Sean Dolan. This model uses a computer to calculate changes in the
ocean and atmosphere, and their relations with one another. Termed
a ``dynamic'' model, meaning it uses mathematical formulas to
calculate changes, it predicted the El Nino more than a year ahead
of time.
   _A model based primarily on changing ocean conditions, coupled
with unusual wind currents, developed by James O'Brien and D.
Legler of Florida State University. This combined dynamic and
statistical information and can issue predictions a few months in
advance, Zebiak explained.
   _A statistical model using wind patterns and sea-level air
pressure readings over the Pacific and Indian oceans, which can
give predictions with lead times of 3 to 9 months. This pair or
related models was developed by Timothy Barnett and Nicholas E.
Graham at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.
   In the case of the 1986-87 El Nino, all three models wound up
making the same prediction, just at different times, Zebiak said.
   ``It is interesting that different models, which are based on
quite different kinds of approaches, are showing consistency. I
think it is basically encouraging, another piece of evidence that
there really is a robust kind of signal here, which we are
capturing in different ways.''
   ``The fact is that these kind of forecasts are a reality now,
they will continue. We and the other people are doing it sort of
routinely now. What remains to be assessed is the kind of feeling
for exactly how reliable they are going to be in the situations
that nature throws our way,'' Zebiak said.

<HEAD>Seattle Opera Won't Revive Ring Cycle Before 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seattle Opera is putting off its next
mounting of Richard Wagner's four-opera Ring Cycle for at least two
more years, company officials have announced.
   ``Der Ring des Niebelungen,'' a staple of the company since
1975, won't be revived before 1991, general director Speight
Jenkins said Wednesday.
   Instead, the Seattle Opera will mount a production of Wagner's
``Die Meistersinger'' next year and Prokofiev's ``War and Peace''
in 1990, he said.
   He also announced the company balanced its 1987-88 budget ``with
a slight surplus.''
   Jenkins had planned to revive the Ring Cycle _ ``Das
Rheingold,'' ``Die Walkure,'' ``Siegfried,'' and
``Gotterdammerung'' _ next summer after a one-year break in annual
productions that had made the Opera House a mecca for Wagner
devotees from around the world.
   The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., is in the final stages
of negotiation to host the Deutsche Oper Berlin's production of the
operas next June. In May, the Metropolitan Opera of New York will
present its new Ring.
   As a result, Jenkins said, Wagner fans would be drawn east next
year.
   In 1990 the San Francisco Opera plans to revive its highly
successful 1985 production of the operas.
   ``We will do the `Ring' in 1991, unless a cataclysm strikes me
or this company,'' Jenkins pledged.
   The production of the rarely heard ``War and Peace'' is planned
in a collaboration with the Soviet Union in conjunction with the
Goodwill Games. Negotiations for that production have yet to be
concluded.
   An extended absence of the Wagnerian retelling of Teutonic
legend won't mean the loss of Seattle's reputation as a center for
Wagner, but the expensive production can't be taken for granted,
either, Jenkins said.
   ``The Ring is not just going to be there, like Mount Rainier,''
he said. ``You have to work to earn and fund a Ring.''
   He said it would be twice as expensive to revive the Ring cycle
as to produce ``Meistersinger,'' which is expected to have a budget
of about $1.2 million. The last new production of the opera in the
United States was in 1977.
   To open its 25th season, the company is giving four performances
this month of ``Satyagraha,'' an account of Mohandas Gandhi's years
as a young lawyer in South Africa by the minimalist composer Philip
Glass.

   U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf are ``in an
untenable position'' and President Reagan's policy in the region
needs to be reassessed following the Navy's downing of an Iranian
airliner with 290 people on board, Senate Democratic leader Robert
Byrd said today.
   Byrd and other members of Congress attending a series of
closed-door Pentagon briefings appear convinced that the captain of
the USS Vincennes acted responsibly in launching the missile that
destroyed an Iranian airliner with 290 people on board.
   In a Senate floor speech, Byrd said he is not advocating a U.S.
withdrawal from the gulf, where American ships have operated for 40
years. He added:
   ``It's one thing to maintain our presence there. But it's
another thing to go day to day in a volatile environment. ... They
are placed in an untenable position.''
   He said he had asked Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci on
Wednesday to ``give us a new assessment'' of threats to the Navy in
the shallow, crowded gulf. He said the new review is needed ``so we
won't be going from day to day with the likelihood of this
occurring again.''
   CIA Director William Webster, meanwhile, said after a closed
meeting with the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the United
States was ``of course'' prepared for any Iranian reprisals.
   Declining to be specific, he said:
   ``We already have in place a very effective counter-intelligence
strategy around the world, and it's being utilized. The one thing
you don't do in situations like this is panic and run to put the
sand trucks up in place.
   ``Our government has procedures in place to protect our citizens
and our officials who would be likely targets. And they are being
utilized.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright, meanwhile, called Sunday's incident
``a very straightforward error of misidentification'' but said the
Iranian government ``must assume some serious responsibility for
this kind of an error'' because of the attacks by its gunboats on
the Vincennes just before the A-300 Airbus was shot down.
   Lawmakers said several factors _ the skirmish with Iranian
patrol boats, electronic data that made the approaching plane
appear to be military and intelligence information that indicated
heightened chance of a major attack _ combined to justify the
decision of the captain of the USS Vincennes to fire two missiles
at an unseen target.
   ``The ship's captain had every reason in the world to feel
threatened,'' Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said after one briefing on Wednesday. ``I don't
think he had any choice but to shoot it down.''
   ``Every precaution the ship's commander could take was taken,''
said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., noting that radar
told the ship the approaching plane was descending from about 9,000
feet and gaining speed.
   That information was at odds with data gathered by another ship
in the area, the USS John H. Sides, which put the altitude as
12,000 feet and steady. That and other conflicts remain to be
cleared up by a Navy investigative team sifting through recorded
information in the Persian Gulf.
   Other unanswered questions included why the Airbus 300 passenger
jet apparently was emitting electronic ``signatures'' for both a
commercial plane and for a military craft.
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
he believed the most likely explanation was that the code for a
military plane was actually emitted by a second aircraft in the
area, but was confused with the signal from the commercial plane by
the sophisticated gear on board the Vincennes, an Aegis-class
cruiser.
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said
he believed it was too early to explain the dual civilian and
military signals that seemed to be coming from the plane. If a
second plane were involved, ``suffice it to say that the captain
could not have known that based on the information he had,'' Nunn
said.
   Little new information emerged from the three House and Senate
briefings by Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci and a phalanx of
subordinates.
   The Pentagon did back off from its earlier assertion that the
Iranian airliner was flying outside the prescribed commercial air
corridor, conceding that while the plane had deviated from the
corridor's center, it had never actully left the designated
airspace.
   Several lawmakers also said U.S. forces' nervousness had been
heightened by specific intelligence warnings in the days before
that a major attack on them was likely over the July Fourth weekend.
   Aspin said intelligence received in the days before the incident
indicated that two Iranian F-14s had been moved from a military
airfield elsewhere in Iran to the joint military-civilian airfield
at Bandar Abbas on Iran's coastline.
   Aspin also said the electronic ``signature'' picked up by the
Vincennes just before the shootdown bore the identical digital code
that had been associated with F-14s flying in the area in the days
before the incident. The failure to identify the jumbo jet shows
that identifying aircraft electronically remains ``an art, not a
science,'' he added.
   ABC News on Wednesday quoted military sources as saying Iranian
commercial airliners have been used to carry soldiers from Bandar
Abbas _ the point of origin for Iran Air flight 655 _ to the front
with Iraq. The sources said troop transports often have carried
both civilian and military transponders, the radar-activated
devices that broadcast a plane's identification signal.
   Aspin said lawmakers were told the plane was warned to identify
itself at least a dozen times on both civilian and military
frequencies, beginning within two or three minutes after it took
off from Bandar Abbas and before it turned to make a course
correction, heading it toward the Vincennes.
   In other developments:
   _Lawmakers continued to be generally supportive of the idea of
paying compensation to families of victims, which was being studied
by administration officials. ``I do not believe it would constitute
any admission of guilt,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``To have
compensation awarded would be an act of generosity ... and would be
very appropriate in this case.''
   _A Washington Post-ABC poll published today found that 71
percent of the respondents believed shooting down the plane was
justified while 23 percent disagreed. The telephone survey of 524
randomly selected adults in the continental United States was
conducted Tuesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percentage points.
   _Soviet military staff chief Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev said
at a Pentagon news conference that he had discussed the incident
with his U.S. counterpart, Adm. William Crowe. Akhromeyev said he
had concluded that destruction of the Iranian jetliner differed
from the Soviet shootdown of a Korean Air Lines commercial flight
over the Sea of Japan in 1983. ``I would not draw any
similarities,'' he said.

   China's public security minister told the
nation's police chiefs that counterrevolutionary activity,
foreign-instigated sabotage and ordinary crime are increasing, it
was reported Thursday.
   According to the official China Daily newspaper, Minister Wang
Fang warned that ``sabotage instigated from abroad has been
intensified recently.''
   Wang did not elaborate, and it was not clear whether he was
referring to sabotage against the Chinese government or to last
month's short-lived terrorist threat against Americans in Beijing.
   He urged police to stay on their guard and recommended stiffer
penalties for lawbreakers. China already imposes the death penalty
for numerous crimes, ranging from theft to panda poaching to murder.
   Wang made his comments to more than 200 public security
directors at the end of a national conference Wednesday.
   A day earlier, Premier Li Peng told the gathering that public
security must be tightened to control ``social upheavals'' that
will inevitably result from China's ongoing economic reforms.
   Discontent with price increases, widening income gaps between
poor and rich and student pressure for political freedom to match
the new economic freedom all have contributed to growing tensions
in Chinese society.
   Peasant raids on fertilizer warehouses, short-lived strikes over
wages and other illegal and sometimes violent protests that would
have been unheard of a decade ago have become more frequent.
   Three large illegal protests are known to have occured in
Beijing in June.
   About 1,000 Beijing University students marched to Public
Security headquarters on June 3 to protest the murder of a fellow
student. A second planned march was thwarted by a police show of
force.
   Several dozen students from the northeastern city of Changchun
tried to hold a sit-in outside Communist Party headquarters a week
later complaining that their study program was not accredited.
   More than 1,500 peasants in a village on Beijing's outskirts
clashed with police to try to halt the release of contaminated
water into their drinking and irrigation water supply.
   Both the Changchun students and the peasants were dispersed
forcibly. A series of statements by top officials during the month
made it clear they have no intention of allowing the authority of
the ruling Communist Party to be challenged.
   White collar and violent crime also have increased, partly
because of the new social tensions and partly because China's
economic reforms have increased temptations to steal.
   The Public Security Ministry said crimes resulting in serious
injury or death rose 31 percent in the first four months of the
year, compared with the same period last year.
   Officials have said cases of gambling, prostitution and
publishing pornography are increasing, and they have blamed China's
greater openness to the outside world.
   China last month had its first known case of a terrorist threat
against foreigners. Officials said nationals from an undisclosed
third country plotted an attack on Americans in Beijing, but were
thwarted. No details were released.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unusual gesture, the Cuban government
has allowed a human rights activist and former political prisoner
to make a monthlong visit to the United States.
   Elizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Human Rights and National
Reconciliation Commission, said that he believes he is the first
dissident to be given permission to leave Cuba for purposes other
than emigration since the start of the revolution 29 years ago.
   The main purpose of Sanchez's U.S. visit is to meet with his
wife and children, who came to the United States aboard the Mariel
boat lift in 1980. He plans to return to Cuba in August.
   Sanchez discussed the human rights situation in Cuba in measured
terms because he believes that strong language could jeopardize his
hopes for positive changes on the island.
   ``We don't want to corner the government,'' he said.
   Sanchez spoke to a reporter Thursday shortly after his arrival
in Washington from Miami.
   Sanchez, 44, is a former professor of philosophy and the history
of philosophy who was stripped of his job in 1968 because of his
unorthodox political views.
   Since then, he has spent seven years in prison because of his
activities as a dissident. He now works in a municipal library in
Havana, although for many years the only jobs he could find were as
a mechanic and a laundry employee, he said.
   He was last imprisoned in the fall of 1986 after speaking with
reporters from two West European news agencies. The reporters were
expelled from the country, and Sanchez said he spent eight months
in solitary confinement before his release last summer.
   Sanchez said he had applied repeatedly for permission to leave
the country over the past eight years but his requests were
ignored. In April, he finally got the go-ahead after he sent a
telegram to President Fidel Castro seeking his assistance.
   Asked if he is grateful for Castro's help, Sanchez said that
permission to leave one's homeland is a right specified in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that an expression of
gratitude would therefore not be appropriate.
   ``It's a right that all should have,'' he said.
   During his U.S. visit, Sanchez said he expects to meet with
representatives of the human rights groups, including Amnesty
International and Americas Watch, but he added that he is not
seeking publicity.
   He described the human rights situation in Cuba as
``precarious'' and said the lack of individual freedoms is the most
difficult problem.
   ``The current administration (in Cuba) has a lot to do to
improve the situation,'' he said.
   Asked why he doesn't plan to remain in the United States,
Sanchez said there are enough Cubans outside the island who call
attention to human rights practices there.
   ``The most important thing (for me) is to remain inside Cuba,''
he said.

   The American Federation of Teachers and
archrival National Education Association wound up their annual
conventions apparently closer than ever to agreeing on workable
approaches to school reform.
   But don't tell that to NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell or AFT
President Albert Shanker, who seem far more comfortable nursing
their rivalry than contemplating a ceasefire.
   NEA's 8,227 delegates meeting here this week, and AFT's 3,000
delegates in San Francisco, endorsed reform proposals aimed at
freeing teachers to experiment. The separate schemes differed in
detail, not spirit.
   The AFT proposed creating thousands of ``schools within
schools'' where small clusters of teachers could try out their
ideas. The NEA would designate at least one entire school district
in each state as ``learning laboratories.''
   Asked if her plan signaled a rare consensus with the AFT,
Futrell flinched.
   The AFT plan was ``not a new idea,'' she said, and was ``more
narrow than what we proposed.''
   And Shanker ridiculed NEA officials who he said still believe
that money alone will solve education's problems.
   The AFT-NEA war goes on.

   With the tough competition of the
``Olympics of barbershop singing'' only a day away, hundreds of
vocalists found harmony in hotel lobbies and halls as they belted
out familiar tunes.
   But all bets were off today, when more than 1,000 barbershop
quartet and chorus singers compete at the 50th International
Convention of the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of
Barbershop Quartet Singing in America.
   Fifty-one quartets will battle for five finalist positions,
while 16 choruses of at least 50 men each vie for five spots.
   The finals are set for Saturday, with one gold, one silver and
three bronze medals up for grabs in each category. The gold medal
winners are the international champions.
   ``This is the Olympics of barbershop singing and all of them
have had to battle on the local level to get here,'' international
president James Warner, a lawyer from Memphis, Tenn., said
Wednesday. ``It will be a tough competition because there is a lot
of prestige that goes with the medals.''
   The competition may be fierce, but in virtually every corner of
the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center and hotels Wednesday, many
unfamiliar foursomes gathered like old chums and stretched their
vocal chords.
   Barbershop quartets, which cropped up mainly on the East Coast
at the turn of the century and became popular during the vaudeville
era, use four-part harmonies to carry tunes.
   The lead singer carries the melody. A tenor harmonizes and a
baritone and a bass handle the lower chords.
   Barbershop quartets began fading when vaudeville was replaced by
other forms of music and motion pictures in the aftermath of World
War I.
   But in 1938, Owen C. Cash, a Tulsa, Okla., tax attorney, and
Rupert Hall, another Tulsa businessman, formed the barbershop
quartet society to preserve the music.
   Today, there are 2,000 quartets and 800 choruses divided into 16
regions in the United States and Canada, as well as other groups in
England, Sweden, West Germany, Holland and New Zealand.
   The organization, based in Kenosha, Wis., helped spawn two women
barbershop singing groups, the Sweet Adelines Inc. and Harmony Inc.
   ``I think we are gaining some respect again across the
country,'' Warner said.
   ``We are developing programs for young men in some high schools
and it's found increasing acceptance,'' he said.
   Greg Zinke, 27, began singing in a quartet after being around
his father's group.
   Zinke, who works in a tool and die shop in High Bridge, N.J.,
said he opted for barbershop quartet singing instead of rock 'n'
roll because of the selection of clean, simple old songs.
   ``Just about anybody that has some kind of ear for music can do
this; you don't have to be a professional,'' Zinke said.
   ``You don't have to be a fantastic singer to do this. I think
that's what makes it so nice for the guy off the street who admires
the music. He can come sing it, too,'' he said.
   ``It's easy to sing and it's portable,'' said 35-year-old Roger
Payne of New York City. ``All you have to have is your pitch pipe
and three other guys and you don't have to call anybody to move
your piano. It interacts with the audience in a real
entertainment-kind of way.''

   Wildfires crackled through the country's parched forests,
including a 10,000-acre blaze that threatened Mount Rushmore
National Memorial and an 118,000-acre fire that burned within 10
miles of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
   More than 1,000 people had been evacuated by early today from
the Custer State Park fire in South Dakota near the granite
monument to four presidents.
   In Alaska, hundreds of firefighters battled three of the state's
more serious wildfires as weather forecasts continued to offer
scant hope for rain.
   The fire burning near the pipeline on the Yukon Flats National
Wildlife Refuge grew from 110,000 acres on Monday, Bureau of Land
Management spokeswoman Sue Mitchell said. About 80 firefighters
were assigned to the fire that is one of three the BLM either
manned or monitored on the refuge.
   ``What they're trying to do is stop it from getting any closer
to the pipeline,'' Mitchell said.
   The pipeline is made of heavy-gauge steel and ``is not
susceptible to serious damage from a fire of that nature,'' said
Tom Brennan, a spokesman for Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. But, he
said, ``We would rather not have it in the area of a pump station,
because those are manned, for one thing.''
   Firefighters in Utah finished cutting fire lines today around an
850-acre blaze that has blackened oak, brush and Ponderosa pine in
Zion National Park. They expected to have the fire contained by
tonight, officials said.
   The fire began June 19 and was allowed to burn in a small
``conditional area'' in accordance with park policy allowing
natural fires to take their course, said Chief Ranger Bob Andrew.
   On Sunday, however, winds gusting to 60 mph fanned the flames
out of the conditional area, and up to 200 firefighters were
brought in.
   In southern Utah, 45 firefighters battled a 3,500-acre fire that
broke out late Wednesday on Bureau of Land Management and private
land about three miles north of Beryl near the Nevada border.
   Spokeswoman Eulail Pickering said the fire was 85 percent
contained and crews anticipated full containment later today.
   Another fire in wilderness area that also began June 19, was
being held in check at 3,400 acres in south-central Montana. The
lightning-caused fire was allowed to burn in the Absaroka Beartooth
Wilderness until it flared up over the Independence Day weekend and
burned more than 1,600 acres.
   Smokejumpers worked the north face of the fire Wednesday while
four helicopters dropped water and foam, said information officer
Jo Barnier in the Billings Interagency Fire Center.
   Wyoming firefighters, aided by cooler temperatures and a drop in
winds overnight, contained a 1,300-acre fire in the Bridger-Teton
National Forest at 6 a.m. today, forest officials said.
   Two volunteer firefighters were injured, one seriously, battling
the blaze, said forest spokesman Fred Kingwill.
   ``We still have a ways to go before we'll call it controlled,''
he said, adding that the wind in the next few days will determine
the future of the fire.
   Officials originally said the fire had burned up 1,500 acres but
downgraded the acreage to 1,300 after fire lines were dug and the
blaze could be reassessed.
   In Yellowstone National Park, three fires covering nearly 1,900
acres of backcountry still were burning Wednesday. The fires, one
covering 1,800 acres in the northwestern corner of the park and two
others near Shoshone and Lewis lakes in the southern part of the
park, were not threatening any structures and were being allowed to
burn themselves out.
   Farther east, six small forest fires burned on in northeast
Pennsylvania. Three of the fires were caused by weekend fireworks
and three by arson, said Lackawanna District Forester Anthony
Santoli in Scranton.
   The largest fire burned more than 75 acres of woodland on
Montage Mountain, near Moosic, Santoli said. The other large fire
charred about 60 acres at Campbells Ledge, near Duryea.

   Workers at the Point Defiance Zoo and

orphaned on a beach.
   The pup, named ``Indy'' because it was discovered on
Independence Day, is believed to be only the second immature harbor
porpoise kept alive in captivity, said Lily Moore, zoo information
officer.
   A pup found last year at Point Defiance died within four months,
and zoo officials said chances for the new baby porpoise's survival
also are slim.
   Two young girls playing on the beach at the Necanicum River
estuary near Seaside, Ore., found the pup.
   The umbilicus _ the navel which quickly disappears _ was evident
and the pup's dorsal fin was flaccid, which indicates a young age,
Moore said.
   ``It's in very good shape, considering all that it's been
through,'' she said. ``It conceivably could have been born on the
day the girls found it.''
   The porpoise arrived at the zoo Tuesday afternoon, measuring 33
inches long and weighing 16 pounds. Harbor porpoises will grow to
about 5 feet long, Moore said.
   Visitors can't see the harbor porpoise because officials are
trying to minimize stress on it.

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS Kernville to Kerrville in 2nd graf, `Christopher Lee

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy accompanied by a retired
Navy pilot ace today flew off on his quest to retrace Charles A.
Lindbergh's historic flight to Paris, a 7,000-mile journey.
   Christopher Lee Marshall of Oceano, Calif., and Randy
Cunningham, 46, departed from Montgomery Field at 8:32 a.m. today
on the first leg of their trip to Kerrville, Texas.
   The two, flying the first leg in a borrowed plane, will trade it
for a new Mooney 252 aircraft built for the trans-Atlantic journey.
Takeoff was originally scheduled for Monday, but was delayed by
storms in Texas.
   In 1927, Lindbergh flew from San Diego to St. Louis, Mo., then
to New York City before completing his 33{-hour non-stop solo
flight across the Atlantic Ocean to Paris.
   Because Cunningham is limiting the boy's flying time to less
than eight hours at a time, the trip will stretch out over five
days and include stops in Kernville; St. Louis, Mo.; New York;
Montreal; Sondestrom, Greenland, and Reykjavik, Iceland.
   According to Chris, the flight to Paris would make him the
world's youngest trans-Atlantic pilot.
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said shortly before takeoff. ``I am an
ambassador to the youth of America, and I want to show all the
youth that if I can do my dreams, anyone can.''
   He said ``trying to stay awake'' would probably be the most
difficult part, ``but I will.''
   ``I'm not going to touch the controls unless there's an
emergency. Chris' aviation skills are phenomenal,'' Cunningham
said. The youngster has logged 200 hours, compared to Cunningham's
more than 7,000 miles.
   Chris, the son of a commercial air pilot, gained fame last
August when at age 10 he became the youngest aviator to fly across
the United States.
   In April, however, a 9-year-old from San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., Tony Aliengena, broke the record by making a
California-Massachusetts round trip.
   Chris and his mother, Gail Marshall, who live about 15 miles
south of San Luis Obispo in central California, recruited
Cunningham for this trip after meeting him at an air show last year.
   Cunningham, a retired Miramar Naval Air Station, Calif.,
commander, was the only Navy pilot ace in the Vietnam War and is
the most-decorated Navy pilot, a Navy spokesman in San Diego said.

<HEAD>Progress Urged on Nuclear Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 40-nation Conference on Disarmament opened its
summer session Thursday with a call for progress toward banning
nuclear weapons tests and chemical weapons.
   Swedish ambassador Maj Britt Theorin, in a keynote speech, said
failure to agree on a final document at last month's U.N. Special
Session on Disarmament must not hamper the conference's
negotiations.
   She alleged that U.S. negotiators prevented the 160-nation
session from agreeing on a final document by blocking an extension
of time.
   U.S. Ambassador Max Friedersdorf rejected the accusation as
``highly offensive and deeply insulting,'' saying other factors
also contributed to the meeting's disappointing outcome.
   Starting off the 10-week conference session, Theorin said the
U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating intermediate-range nuclear missiles
``a major breakthrough for nuclear disarmament.'' She expressed
hope the two superpowers will agree soon on halving their
long-range nuclear arsenals.
   But indications that additional countries have stockpiled
chemical weapons and their increasing sophistication give rise to
``grave concern,'' she told delegates to the world's only
multilateral arms negotiating body.
   Washington and Moscow have failed to agree on a deadline or any
concrete commitment to speed the conference's 20-year negotiations
on a comprehensive chemical weapons ban, she said.
   Several outstanding issues, including details of verification,
could be settled ``if good will persists,'' she said. ``Time is not
on our side.''
   On nuclear testing, she said a comprehensive ban ``is as urgent
as ever.'' She noted more than 1,600 atomic test explosions were
set off by the end of last year and all five nuclear weapons states
carried out tests in 1987.
   The U.S.-Soviet talks on nuclear testing should focus on
limiting the number of tests as a step toward a comprehensive ban,
Theorin said.

   It's enough to make you swear off
water.
   Mildred Forney was in her kitchen six years ago, with her hand
on the faucet when lightning struck just outside. ``I guess it went
through the pipes or something, but it threw me all over the
kitchen, into the refrigerator and the table and onto the floor.''
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Fortney, 63, was outside placing a pail to
catch rainwater for her plants, when ``I felt a force pick me up
and it threw me across the carport. I don't know what the lightning
hit, if it was the ground next to me or the bucket. But it really
threw me, and I wound up on my hands and knees facing the opposite
direction.''
   Mrs. Fortney was treated at HCA-New Port Richey Hospital for
knee and ankle injuries and released. She also complained of a hot
and tingling sensation in her arm, and paramedics said her blood
pressure was high.
   ``It really shakes you up,'' she said. ``It's a terrible feeling
because you have no control over it. That was definitely an
expensive bucket of rainwater.''

<TEXT>
   A five-day heat wave blamed for 15 deaths
combined with heavy smog in the Athens basin Thursday to send more
than 500 people to hospitals, most with heart and breathing
problems.
   Hospitals around the country were place on alert. Temperatures
in Athens reached 106 degrees Fahrenheit at 2:45 p.m. for the
second straight day.
   Yugoslavia, Greece's northern neighbor, reported at least 26
people dead in a heat wave that has gripped Belgrade for a week.
The temperature soared to 104 degrees Wednesday.
   The Greek national weather service said temperatures were not
expected to drop until Sunday.
   ``The smog of Athens sent 496 people to hospital with cardiac
and respiratory problems as pollution reached murderous levels,''
said a statemment by the Panhellenic Center for Ecologic Studies.
   A report from the National Center for Emergency Help said 404
people were treated as outpatients for heart or breathing
difficulties and 92 were hospitalized. It said hospitals admitted
25 people suffering from heat stroke.
   Nikos Benardis, the Athens coroner, said the heat contributed to
the deaths of 15 elderly people.
   ``Most of them had previous heart conditions and were on
medication,'' he said. ``The heat certainly aggravated the
condition of those with cardiac problems that caused their deaths.''
   Soaring temperature have caused a shortage of electric fans and
hundreds of people lined up at appliance stores for the few that
remained.
   ``We had 60 fans in the store and sold them all within minutes
of opening. There are people who have been waiting two or three
days to buy one,'' said Efthimios Arevas, sales manager of a large
appliance stores.
   He reported receiving orders from ``hospitals and even the army
for 30 fans that we don't have. It's worse than last year.''
   One year ago, more than 900 people died in a 10-day heat wave.
Lack of air conditioning in city hospitals was blamed for many of
the deaths.
   Sismanogleion Hospital said crews were installing more
air-conditioning units and the medical staff was on 24-hour alert.
   The environmental study center said smoke, nitrogen dioxide and
total suspended particles in the Athens atmosphere were four to
five times danger levels.
   No figures were available from the government Center for
Pollution Control because a bomb wrecked its offices early
Wednesday. The leftist group Revolutionary Popular Struggle said it
planted the bomb to protest environmental pollution.
   Athens has been plagued for years by the brown mass of
pollutants that forms in the lower atmosphere on warm, still days
and is known as the nefos, the Greek word for cloud. Government
anti-pollution measures introduced in January have failed to
eliminate it.

<HEAD>House Republicans Introduce Family Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican leaders unveiled an
``American Family Act'' on Thursday, saying they hoped the bill
would win Vice President George Bush's backing and influence issues
ranging from child care to gang-busting.
   ``It is not enough for Republicans to deride the failures of the
Great Society programs. We must provide a framework for change,''
House Republican Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said at a news
conference.
   The $2 billion package would provide federal support for
promising state, local and private programs designed to strengthen
the American family.
   Though they'll introduce the legislation in August, sponsors are
really shooting for action in the next Congress, said Rep. Dan
Coats, R-Ind., the principal author of the bill.
   Sponsors also want to make the bill part of the GOP platform and
are hoping Bush, the all-but-certain GOP presidential nominee, will
endorse it in whole or in part. One of the sponsors is Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Calif., co-chairman of the Republican Convention Platform
Committee.
   Specifically, the bill contains the following initiatives:
   _Up to $50 million to states for experiments in school-based
management, in which teachers play a major management role and
districts have greater budget and curriculum flexibility.
   _$50 million to promote unrestricted school enrollment policies
aimed at forcing schools to compete.
   _Up to $450 million for ``bootstrap schools'' which have
predominantly minority or low-income students.
   _$600,000 for ``character education'' pilot programs and
promotion. Grants would be available only to schools that require
the Pledge of Allegiance daily.
   _College savings bonds, with tax-exempt interest if proceeds
were used for tuition and other costs associated with higher
education of the taxpayer, spouse, child or dependent. Such
legislation has already been introduced with the backing of Reagan
and Bush.
   _A $1.3 billion proposal targeting aid to low-income working
families, already introduced by Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa,
   _A multimillion-dollar program to fight gang warfare, including
$5 million to encourage states to adopt restitution laws, $7
million to states with laws allowing courts to find parents liable
for restitution, $3.5 million for law enforcement areas that want
to set up a tracking system for juvenile offenders. Also, there
would be grants for community reclamation and other projects.
   _Child support enforcement initiatives, including mandatory
automatic wage withholding and a requirement that at least 17
percent of a non-custodial parent's income go to support one child.
   _Allowing public housing authorities to charge no more than
fair-market rent for housing. Currently, families pay 30 percent of
their gross incomes.
   _$10 million in start-up money for projects that coordinate
services to high risk children.
   The Republicans said they are planning a second family package
to address the issues of housing, work and family, and possibly
health. It is unclear, they said, whether the next bill will
include a provision guaranteeing new parents job-protected leave.
   ``There's a lot of controversy about it,'' Coats said of such a
requirement for parental leave, an idea promoted by Democrats and
some Republicans but strongly opposed by business. ``We've resisted
the temptation to pick up a politically charged issue and throw
something out there that we're not 100 percent comfortable with.''

<HEAD>U.S. Company To Buy Hi-Tech From China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. company announced Thursday it will buy
advanced technology from China, an unusual agreement that reverses
the roles of the two countries in most high technology transfers.
   The company, EG&G Inc., will buy technological know-how and
components for developing a helium magnetometer used for
geophysical mapping and minerals exploration, said EG&G Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer John M. Kucharski.
   The technology will be provided by the China National Geological
Technology Development Import and Export Co., under the Ministry of
Geology and Mineral Resources.
   ``This is the first time for the ministry to cooperate with an
American company to export technical products to the U.S.,'' said
Vice-Minister Xia Guozhi.
   EG&G, a Massachusetts-based high technology company with an
18-year history in China, previously had sold technology to China,
but this is its first time on the buying end.
   China has shared scientific and technological knowledge,
especially in the areas of agriculture, with African countries. It
just signed an agreement with Brazil to develop and launch two
scientific satellites in a joint venture.
   The United States last fall briefly froze further liberalization
of high technology transfers to China to protest alleged sales of
Chinese Silkworm missiles to Iran.
   Bilateral trade last year reached $10.4 billion, according to
U.S. statistics.
   Under the six-year agreement, EG&G will use Chinese know-how to
develop the helium magnetometer, which will be produced in the
United States and sold on the international market. The instrument
can be used on airborne, marine and portable land-based systems for
mapping the Earth's magnetic field.
   EG&G made no payments on the technology. Instead, the Chinese
company will be paid on a royalty-basis. Neither side would reveal
the amount.
   Kucharski told reporters that sales of the magnetometer are
expected to exceed $10 million.
   Bian Zhaohao, president of China National Geological Technology
Import and Export Corp., said the amount of money his company will
earn is small, but added that the significance of technology
transfer from China to the United States was far more important
than the profits.
   ``In this way, we would like to create various forms of
cooperation not only with the U.S. but with other countries as
well,'' he said, adding the agreement reflects China's policy of
encouraging transfers and cooperation with other countries in the
development of technology.

   An armada of rescue ships and
helicopters scoured the chilly North Sea today for 150 people
missing after a fire engulfed an oil platform in possibly the worst
oil rig disaster ever.
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. the owner of the rig, said in a
statement that a gas leak was apparently to blame. Derek Ellington,
a survivor, described hearing a gas leak ``screaming like a
banshee'' seconds before an explosion ripped through the Piper
Alpha platform.
   Flames continued to leap into the air above the burning wreck of
twisted metal. Two explosions triggered Wednesday night's inferno
on the Piper Alpha rig, 120 miles off the Scottish coast.
   Police said there was little hope of finding any more survivors.
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson told Parliament that 229 people
had been on the oil platform. He said 65 survived and 16 bodies
were found, leaving 148 missing. In addition, two of three rescuers
who disappeared still were missing.
   Occidental Petroleum said 66 men survived and police said 67.
The discrepancies were not immediately explained.
   Police said most workers on the rig were Scottish, but Press
Association, the domestic news agency, said workers from the United
States, Canada, continental Europe and South Africa were aboard.
   Officials at Occidental Petroleum's Los Angeles headquarters had
no immediate information on how many Americans were aboard the rig,
said spokesman Peter Sinclair.
   Armand Hammer, Occidental's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement: ``I wish to extend my deepest
personal sympathy to the families of the men who have been injured
or who have lost their lives in this tragic accident in the North
Sea. We will continue to do everything we can to assist the injured
and their families.''
   If those missing are confirmed dead, the accident will be the
world's worst oil rig disaster.
   The Guinness Book of Records lists the worst as the capsizing of
the Alexander L. Kielland platform in Norwegian waters in March
1980, when 123 people died.
   ``It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' said Ron
Carey, 45, who managed to leap off the Piper Alpha into the
57-degree water after he was choked by smoke.
   Towering flames lit up the night, and smoke blackened the sky
today.
   ``With the passage of time, hopes are fading of finding any
other survivors,'' said a police statement.
   Six NATO warships diverted from maneuvers to join the search
that filled the skies with helicopters and the waters with more
than two dozen boats.
   Sleeping workers died when flames raced through the Piper
Alpha's living quarters. Others leaped 150 feet into the water.
   The Aberdeen coast guard said rescuers from a rescue vessel, the
Sandhaven, disappeared into the flames as they headed to the rig in
a small boat and a second explosion occurred. Police said two were
missing.
   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message of sympathy and Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher expressed deep shock.
   Aberdeen hospital spokesman Alan Reid told reporters 21 people
were hospitalized, 13 of them in serious condition.
   Carey, an instrument technician, lay in a hospital bed with his
arm in a sling and his eyes closed by burns.
   He said he was choked by smoke after hearing the first of two
explosions.
   ``It was over the side or nothing. I just dived. It may have
been 60 feet. I was totally enveloped,'' he said.
   A second explosion sent bits of lifeboat raining into the water,
he said. ``There was a lot of debris floating around and the flames
were billowing above us. I found my head was being cooked. I had to
keep ducking down to get it cool.''
   He saw bodies float past and then was rescued.
   Dr. Alistair Matheson of the Royal Infirmary, who treated
injured aboard a rescue ship close to the rig, said, ``There was a
strange silence about the place. I could feel the heat of the
flames in my face. I knew this was a disaster of major
proportions.''
   Matheson said survivors told of taking refuge in a cool area of
the rig, and, when the flames approached, finding nowhere to jump
where the sea was clear of flames. Two who jumped survived.
   ``Those who were lucky and able to escape were up and at work at
the time and were able to jump straight into the sea and get into
rescue vessels,'' John Brading, Occidental's executive vice
president, told a news conference.
   He announced an urgent inquiry into why lifeboats with room for
300 people failed to get off the platform.
   Witnesses said the flames engulfed the rig and towered over the
horizon.
   ``When we went on late last night, we certainly could see the
fire raging from 60 to 70 miles away and the flames at that time
were, we'd estimate, 300 or 400 feet,'' said Royal Air Force
Squadron Leader Garfield Porter, who was involved in the rescue.
   It was the third accident at North Sea oil installations in the
past week. On Friday, a blast rocked British Petroleum's Sullom Voe
onshore terminal on the Shetland Islands.
   On Tuesday, a fire broke out on the North Sea Brent Alpha
platform.
   Occidental is one of the major oil companies operating in the
North Sea. It has been concentrating recently on developing new
fields there.
   Serious incidents have regularly occurred on North Sea drilling,
production and accommodation platforms since the start of the
off-shore exploration boom in the 1960s.
   Structural defects, explosions or bad weather have all been to
blame.

<HEAD>Federal Thrift Regulators Double Texas Bailout Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government regulators more than doubled their
estimate today of how much it will cost to bail out Texas' ailing
savings and loans institutions, telling a House committee that it
now appears the bill will be $15.2 billion.
   Chairman M. Danny Wall of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board told
the House Banking Committee that to help pay for the bailouts, his
agency will raise an additional $12.3 billion, mostly by extending
the special assessment the thrifts now pay on their deposits.
   Panel chairman Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I., asked Wall if he
envisioned needing taxpayers' help in footing the bill ``in the not
too distant future''. Wall responded, ``No, when you added `not too
distant future'.''
   The bank board had been saying that it expects the costs of
merging, selling or liquidating thrifts in Texas to be $7 billion.
   Wall also said he expected his agency to be able to raise $42.5
billion over the next decade for bailouts across the country, an
increase from earlier projections of $30.2 billion.
   Committee members complained that the regulators had been basing
their projections on rosey expectations.
   ``We need hard-nosed, tell-it-like-it-is analyses out of this
federal agency, not sugar-coated pablum,'' said St Germain.

<HEAD>FDA Approves New Cholesterol Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new test to quickly estimate blood
cholesterol levels won approval Thursday from the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The new device, quicker and easier to use than current tests,
uses a drop of blood on a chemically treated card that changes
color according to the amount of cholesterol in the blood.
   The test, to be available for use by physicians, is intended
only as a preliminary screening technique to identify people with
elevated cholesterol levels who may need treatment.
   People with high readings on the screening test should receive
further evaluation with conventional lab tests, the FDA said.
   The new test does not give a count, but indicates whether the
sample tested falls within three ranges: below 200 milligrams per
deciliter, from 200 to 300 milligrams or over 300 milligrams.
   Federal officials health officials urge further evaluation for
anyone with a level above 200 milligrams per deciliter.
   The new test, called ``Clinicard,'' is made by Chem-Elec Inc.,
of North Webster, Ind., and will be available on a limited basis in
about a month, the FDA said.

   A runaway forest fire that swept near Mount
Rushmore before turning aside today charred more than 10,000 acres
and prompted evacuation of up to 1,000 residents and tourists near
the national memorial, authorities said.
   ``When we told them (residents and campers) it was burning 1,000
acres per hour ... and it was three miles away, they kind of
believed us,'' said Sgt. Howard Brunner of the Pennington County
Sheriff's Department, who helped evacuate the town of Keystone late
Wednesday.
   Visitors returned to Mount Rushmore this morning, but it was
accessible only from the west. Superintendent Dan Wenk said smoke
was visible in the distance today, but there was no smoke at the
memorial itself.
   The blaze, which shot billows of smoke so high its pall was
visible 160 miles away Wednesday, also threatened the park's Game
Lodge, summer White House for two presidents. No structures have
been destroyed.
   ``It's a very serious situation,'' Jerry Hagen, fire information
officer with the U.S. Forest Service, said early today. The fire in
Custer State Park and the Black Hills National Forest was within
three miles of Mount Rushmore before switching directions and
heading south, said Richard Hohmann, a spokesman for the state
division of forestry.
   ``The fire behavior was so extreme and erratic that the fire
line was lost several times'' during the night, forcing
firefighters to retreat, Hohmann said.
   Since there are fewer buildings in the southern end of the park,
firefighters can now spend more time battling the blaze and less
time protecting structures, Hohman said.
   An estimated 1,000 firefighters, pilots and rescue personnel are
battling the blaze, Hohmann said. A three-mile-long fire line has
been cleared, but 20 more miles are needed to surround the blaze.
He estimated the line would be completed Sunday night.
   Cooler temperatures and lighter winds were forecast today, which
could help the fire-fighting effort, said Tom Farver, fire
information officer.
   Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, Hagen said.
   All entrances to the park were closed Wednesday.
   The fire was fueled by a continuing drought that has created
extremely dry timber. Smoke was billowing thousands of feet into
the air and the plume was visible from Rapid City 25 miles away. A
haze from the smoke hung over a large part of western South Dakota
and was visible from Pierre, 160 miles away.
   Pennington County sheriff's officials knocked on doors in the
tourist town of Keystone and at the memorial asking people to leave
early today, Hagen said. He estimated between 300 and 400 people
were being evacuated; 600 were evacuated earlier from Custer State
Park.
   ``There was a continuous line of cars from Keystone to Rapid
City, but from all reports it went smoothly,'' Hagen said.
   Keystone, about two miles from Mount Rushmore, has only about
300 residents, but it attracts thousands of tourists. A National
Guard official in Custer estimated Wednesday night that 1,500 to
2,000 people would have to leave the area because it is the height
of the tourist season.
   Neither the town nor the monument was in immediate danger this
morning, but the evacuation was a precaution in case the fire
expands in their direction, said a dispatcher at the fire center
who refused to give his name.
   Employees who work at Mount Rushmore and park officials also
were asked to leave, Hagen said.
   Evacuees fled to a Red Cross shelter in Rapid City or to the
National Guard armory in Custer.
   Menashe and Abigail Barzilai of Winnipeg, Canada, their
month-old baby and two other children were five of the
approximately 170 people who spent the night at the Red Cross
shelter.
   The Barzilais, who had been staying at a Keystone motel, were
evacuated from Mount Rushmore during the evening lighting ceremony,
in which the granite faces are illuminated by floodlights.
   ``We left all of our things in a motel, including the
passports,'' Barzilai said today.
   ``Now we can't go back,'' Mrs. Barzilai said. ``About the fire,
I wasn't worried, but about the passports I was and I don't have
anything for the baby.''
   Authorities believe lightning started the fire in the
north-central part of the 73,000-acre park Monday night. It was not
spotted until Tuesday afternoon.
   The fire burned across the park's northern boundary and entered
Black Hills National Forest land Wednesday night.
   ``It makes you just sick to see the damage that's being done,''
said Gov. George Mickelson, who toured the area by helicopter
Wednesday night.
   Firefighters brought in bulldozers to build a line around the
park's State Game Lodge and sprayed water on it to save it. The
66-year-old lodge was the summer White House for presidents Calvin
Coolidge and Dwight Eisenhower.
   Custer State Park is the second-largest state park in the
nation. It includes the world's largest publicly owned bison herd
at 1,500 animals. The bison graze mostly in the southern part of
the park, away from the fire, but the blaze is burning in some of
the prime habitat for the rare big horn sheep.

<HEAD>Statehood Leader Has No Regrets on 30th Anniversary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Statehood didn't immunize Alaska from
hard times _ oil prices are down and there is no more boom in the
economy _ but a leader in the campaign for a 49th star on the flag
has no regrets.
   ``Statehood has done everything Alaskans said it would do for
them,'' Robert Atwood, chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee,
said as the state marked one of its 30th birthdays.
   It was on July 7, 1958, that President Eisenhower signed the
Alaska statehood bill into law. Some consider the anniversary to be
June 30, the date in 1958 that Congress passed the bill to admit
the huge territory into the union. Still others cite Jan. 3, 1959,
when Eisenhower signed the proclamation admitting Alaska to the
United States.
   None of the dates is drawing much attention this year.
   The list of official Alaska holidays notes instead Seward's Day
in March and Alaska Day in October. Seward's Day marks the 1867
signing of the treaty by which the United States purchased Alaska
from the Russians. Alaska Day recognizes the formal transfer of the
territory and the raising of the flag at Sitka in 1867.
   The struggle for statehood spanned 10 years, said Atwood,
publisher of the Anchorage Times.
   ``We had our issues over statehood in Alaska: Would it be good
for Alaska and Alaskans,'' he said. ``But Congress wanted to know
would statehood be good for the nation. They didn't give a hoot
about what would be good for Alaska.''
   Politically, Atwood said, trying to gather votes among the
nation's lawmakers was ``like trying to line up 1,000 dominoes so
that when you knock one down, they all fall.''
   Representatives from some of the Southern states worried Alaska
would send Washington liberal congressmen who would bolster the
civil-rights movement, he said.
   ``Texas didn't want to lose the title of the biggest state,''
remembered Atwood, who moved to Alaska in 1935. ``They joked about
it, but it was a real concern to them.''
   He said opposition within Alaska came from the canned salmon
industry.
   ``They controlled the economics and the politics of the
territory,'' he said.
   With statehood accomplished, Alaska went through governmental
changes that Atwood believes helped lure investors north.
   Previously, he said, companies with money to stake were held
back by concerns about the amount of power exerted in Alaska by the
Secretary of the Interior. Before statehood, Atwood said, Alaska
was a colony run out of Seattle and Washington, D.C.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz
told Southeast Asian leaders Thursday they do not stand alone in
dealing with the tide of refugees still fleeing Indochina 13 years
after the end of the war.
   ``The commitment of the United States to resolve the Indochinese
refugee problem is as strong today as it has been in the past,''
Shultz said. ``We have come a long way ... Now we solemnly recommit
ourselves to stay the course.''
   Shultz admitted a long-standing policy by Southeast Asians to
grant temporary asylum to the refugees was in jeopardy and proposed
a mix of strategies, including a Bangkok-based working group that
would ``craft new approaches.''
   Shultz spoke at the opening session of a three-day ``dialogue''
among the foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and close partners Japan, Australia, Canada, New Zealand,
the European Community and the United States.
   He arrived Wednesday at the start of a nine-country tour of Asia
amid tight security.
   Thai officials reinforced police and military security personnel
in the wake of the U.S. downing of an Iranian airliner in the
Persian Gulf on Sunday.
   Shultz told reporters traveling with him that the United States
was concerned and alert to the possibility of a response from Iran,
which he accused of supporting terrorism.
   Focusing on Cambodia, Shultz said the United States remained
``unalterably opposed'' to the Khmer Rouge returning to power in
that country. He urged strong support for resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, with whom he confers Friday, and non-communist
groups fighting the Vietnamese in Cambodia.
   ``They represent the political alternative to the Vietnamese
occupation and the Khmer Rouge and are key to a Cambodian
settlement,'' Shultz said.
   He said continued pressure had to be exerted on Vietnam to
withdraw all its forces from Cambodia, but added: ``We look forward
to the time when Vietnam will rejoin the community of nations.''
   In a closed session, Shultz expressed ``cautious optimism''
about the results of talks this month in Jakarta among the warring
sides in Cambodia, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
Vietnam, Laos and ASEAN also are to take part in the talks
beginning July 25.
   ``We do not have an independent plan,'' the spokesman told
reporters. ``Our position is supportive of ASEAN.''
   ``The United States remains unalterably opposed to the Khmer
Rouge ever again taking control in Cambodia, and we believe it is
essential that any settlement have adequate safeguards to prevent
this,'' Shultz said.
   Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno of Japan called for an international
peacekeeping force in Cambodia and said his country would consider
funding and manning such a force.
   Vietnam's forces invaded Cambodia in late 1978, driving the
murderous Khmer Rouge from power and into the jungles where they
and two non-communist groups continue to battle the Vietnamese and
the pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh. Sihanouk leads the
three-party resistance.
   Shultz said Washington regards normalization of relations with
Vietnam in context of a solution in Cambodia. ``Vietnam must
realize that our commitment to a free and independent Cambodia is
unswerving,'' Shultz said.
   The secretary stressed that the issue of nearly 1,800 Americans
still listed as missing in action in Vietnam also continues ``to
divide our two peoples.''
   ``We believe it is critical for Vietnam to move on this issue
this year,'' he said.
   ``You do not stand alone,'' he said, referring to nations in
Asia providing first asylum to refugees from Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia. Communist forces triumphed in those countries in 1975.
   Redman said Shultz's proposal for a refugee working group, which
would include ASEAN, the dialogue partners and the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, received favorable comments from some of
the delegates.
   Shultz also said the United States should discourage clandestine
flights from Vietnam, continue to resettle refugees and get Vietnam
to expand a U.N.-sponsored Orderly Departure Program.
   Facing a fresh surge of Vietnamese boat people, Thailand,
Malaysia and Hong Kong are adopting tougher measures. They claim
that most of the new arrivals are economic migrants rather than
people fleeing political persecution.
   In 1986 the United States accepted about 36,000 Indochinese
refugees who had sought temporary asylum in other parts of Asia.
This fiscal year, the number is about 29,500. Since 1975, more than
900,000 Indochinese refugees have settled in the United States.

<HEAD>House Chairman Assails Proposed Alaska Land Swap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman accused the
Interior Department on Thursday of trying to muster political
support for oil exploration in an Alaska wildlife refuge through a
swap of its potential oil-bearing tracts for land in other refuges.
   Such a swap could kill any chance that Congress would approve
exploration, said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Interior water and power resources subcommittee.
   Miller held hearings on a General Accounting Office report
released Wednesday that said the land swap, as agreed to by the
Fish and Wildlife Service and six native corporations, should be
abandoned.
   The analysts from GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said
the service had valued the swap at six times the appraised value of
the refuge tracts, $539 million vs. $90 million, and would get much
land already protected from development or without much wildlife
value.
   The swap would transfer 896,000 acres of surface rights to
native holdings in seven refuges to the Fish and Wildlife Service
in exchange for mineral rights to 160,000 acres in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge on the state's northeastern coast.
   The department claims it would still hold about two-thirds the
value of the oil, if any is there.
   The Interior Department has defended the exchange in a 20-page
technical critique, calling the GAO report full of errors and
misunderstandings, and has promised an even more detailed response.
But Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel wrote Congress last month he
had decided not to proceed with the required environmental impact
statement, which requires public hearings, for the moment.
   Robert E. Gilmore, Alaska regional director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service when the exchange was negotiated last year and now
assistant to the director in Washington, told the subcommittee
among other things that the appraised values suffer from ``a fatal
flaw:'' Congress forbade the use of condemnation proceedings.
   ``I feel the taxpayers are getting an excellent bargain,
considering the fact there's no assurance there's oil'' under the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge,'' Gilmore said.
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, commented, ``That means (the native
corporations) have got an 81 percent chance of not getting
anything.''
   The department has estimated there is a 19 percent chance of
finding oil, and if any is there, there is a 50 percent chance that
the field would total 3.2 billion barrels and a 5 percent chance of
9 billion barrels, as large as the Prudhoe Bay field about 100
miles away.
   ``This never was designed to be a resource management system,''
Miller said at the close of Gilmore's testimony. ``This was
designed to be a lobbying system ... to generate support for
opening up'' the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.
   ``That's why the economics stink. It's a very, very cynical
approach to this issue,'' Miller continued.
   ``If there's an insistence that this is part of the bargain,
then it is fatal to those deliberations. This is so far outside the
realm of the public interest that Congress can't possibly accept
it.''
   Asked in the hallway if he wanted to respond, Gilmore said,
``Since he didn't give me the opportunity to, I don't choose to
now.'' He said he was ``a little frazzled'' by Miller's attacks.
   Asked if the trade were part of a plan to generate lobbying
support, Interior Department spokesman Alan Levitt said, ``It's
not.''

   The mother of a girl born
prematurely aboard a cruise ship in the Bahamas said Thursday
she'll take another cruise _ but she won't get pregnant again.
   ``This is the last one. This is enough,'' agreed husband Spencer
McCollum, as he and his wife told reporters they have named their
daughter Emera Cay to note the circumstances of her birth.
   The 2-pound, 11-ounce baby was born Wednesday, seven weeks
premature, in the infirmary of the Emerald Seas as the ship made
its stop at Little Stirrup Cay after leaving Nassau in the Bahamas.
Hence the name, Emera Cay.
   The baby was in serious but stable condition Thursday at Miami's
Childrens Hospital, said spokeswoman Ava Osle, who said it was too
early to predict how long the baby will be hospitalized.
   The mother, Wylene McCollum, said she wants to leave Broward
General Medical Center. Dr. Lheri Domond said Mrs. McCollum
probably will be released Friday.
   ``Everything is going great. I just want to hurry up and see how
she's doing,'' Mrs. McCollum said. ``I want to go home.''
   A cruise line spokesman said the McCollums will get another
cruise, free of charge, when they're ready.
   The Atlanta couple also has a 2-year-old daughter.
   The Emerald Seas, which makes regular runs from Miami to the
Bahamas, was anchored off Little Stirrup Cay on Wednesday morning
when Mrs. McCollum gave birth. The ship's crew radioed the Coast
Guard in Miami, and a helicopter equipped with an incubator
airlifted the family to two South Florida hospitals.
   ``The kid will be 6 years old before she realizes that storks
don't have rotary wings,'' said Coast Guard Chief Lou Parris.
   The McCollums, both 23, were taking a four-day cruise for their
anniversary, which is not until September. They took the cruise
early because of her pregnancy.

   A rocket blasted into space today carrying an
unmanned probe on a six-month mission to Mars that is designed to
help prepare for a manned voyage to the planet.
   Soviet television broke into its evening news program ``Vremya''
for a live broadcast of the 9:38 p.m. launch from the Baikonur
space center in the Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
   A 180-foot-tall Proton rocket capped by the probe, Phobos I,
erupted in white and gray smoke and orange and blue flames.
   The newscast switched to the Soviet Mission Control Center
outside Moscow, which reported the spacecraft's flight was normal.
   More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to
swoop close to the surface of Mars' moon, Phobos, and drop probes
onto the small, potato-shaped moon that scientists say may hold
clues to how the universe was formed.
   A second satellite, Phobos II, is scheduled to blast off July 12.
   The satellites will enter Mars' gravity in January and begin a
three-month remote study of the surface and atmosphere of Mars.
After that, scientists said, they will draw closer to Phobos and
drop descent vehicles carrying laser, ionic and radar equipment to
help determine the internal structure and composition of the moon.
   The probes are expected to be sent to Phobos in about April of
next year, according to Roald Sagdeyev, director of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences' Space Research Institute.
   Soviet space scientists said Phobos is an important step toward
a manned flight to Mars, which they hope can take place in the
early 21st century. Officials including Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev have proposed that the United States take part in the
mission.
   ``First, it is necessary to draw up a more accurate map of the
Mars surface in order to choose a place for the future landing,''
said Vyacheslav Balebanov, a deputy to Sagdeyev.
   ``Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil
characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from
Earth, or whther it can be gotten directly on the planet. The study
of Mars renewed under the Phobos program should provide answers to
those questions,'' he said in an interview with the newspaper
Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   Also participating in the project are Austria, Bulgaria,
Hungary, East Germany, Ireland, Poland, Finland, France, West
Germany, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, the United States and
the European Space Agency.
   The Deep Space Network of the U.S. National Aeronautics and
Space Administration will provide tracking data to permit two
100-pound landers to reach Phobos, and then will begin to track the
Martian moon precisely using antennas in California, Spain and
Australia, and a Soviet radio telescope in the Crimea.

   A Pentagon spokesman said today it was
extremely unlikely that a second Iranian airplane was near Iran Air
flight 655 when it was shot down by a U.S. warship Sunday.
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., had said after briefings by Pentagon officials that
the presence of a second plane would explain why the officers
aboard the USS Vincennes mistook the Iranian A300 Airbus for an
F-14 fighter.
   Aspin's comment raised speculation that an Iranian fighter might
have been flying behind the Airbus, hoping to sneak up on the
Vincennes.
   Pentagon spokesman Daniel Howard told reporters that ``the realm
of possibility is fairly small on a phantom aircraft, on a second
aircraft.''
   An Iranian P-3 Orion patrol plane was far to the north of the
Vincennes, along the northern shore of Qeshm Island, and two
Iranian F-4 fighters took off from Bandar Abbas after the Airbus
was shot down, he said, but they played no role in the incident.
   Previously, Pentagon officials had mentioned the P-3 and one of
the F-4's, but they had not mentioned the second F-4.
   The Aegis radar and tracking system aboard the Vincennes is
sophisticated enough to have detected any aircraft flying in tandem
with the Iranian jetliner, Howard said.
   The equipment sends out a radar signal that would have been
three miles high and wide and one mile deep at the point when the
Airbus was nine miles away, the point at which the Vicennes fired
SM-2 Standard missiles at it and knocked it down.
   It would have been almost impossible for any other aircraft to
have been within that area, he said.
   The plane was mistaken for an F-14, Howard said, because the
Airbus was transmitting an identification signal on a frequency
normally reserved for military aircraft.
   Howard also said that Iran should share some responsibility for
the downing of the plane because it took off from the joint
military and civilian airfield at Bandar Abbas during an exchange
of fire between the Vincennes and Iranian gunboats and was headed
straight at the Vincennes when it was shot down.
   ``The Iranians are the ones who bear the resonsibility for
ensuring that if they are the ones who provoke the hostilities,
they are the ones who began the shooting in this incident, that
they ensure the safety of their civilian aircraft by not sending
them into harm's way,'' Howard said.

   The Soviet Union launched an unmanned probe
Thursday night on a six-month trip to Mars' moon, Phobos, for a
mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red
planet.
   The 180-foot-tall booster rocket spewed orange and blue flames
as it illuminated the nighttime sky at the Baikonur space center in
the Soviet Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan.
   The launch of the Proton rocket carrying the probe, Phobos I,
was carried live on Soviet television, which reported that the
spacecraft's flight was proceeding normally.
   More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to
swoop close to the surface of Phobos and drop probes onto the
little, potato-shaped Martian moon that scientists say may hold
clues to how the universe was formed.
   Delegations from around the world gathered at Baikonur for the
launch of Phobos I, a joint East-West project to study the moon and
Mars itself.
   A companion probe, Phobos II, is scheduled for launch on July 12.
   If all goes well, the two spacecraft will enter the
gravitational pull of Mars in January 1989 and fall into orbit just
behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the surface and
atmosphere of the planet. In April, the craft will drop out of
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,
where they will release two small landers.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Thursday that in one
experiment, a laser beam will be used to split a tiny piece of
Phobos' rocky surface and trap a specimen for close examination.
   One of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in
stationary position, sending back data. Another is designed to leap
around the little moon in 20-yard hops gathering soil samples and
analyzing them.
   This is the most sophisticated and ambitious of 18 Soviet and
U.S. unmanned missions to study Mars.
   Soviet space scientists have characterized the Phobos mission as
an important step toward a manned flight to Mars, which they hope
will be possible in the early 21st century.
   The Phobos probes will help map the surface of the planet ``in
order to choose a place for the future landing,'' said Vyacheslav
Balebanov of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' Space Research
Institute. ``Then, it is necessary to study the climate and soil
characteristics and find out whether oxygen should be taken from
Earth, or whether it can be gotten directly on the planet.''
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has proposed that the United
States join in the prospective manned mission, but American
officials have been cool to the idea, saying it would be very
expensive and would require solutions to many difficult problems,
one of which is the problem of astronauts' physical deterioration
during long periods of weightlessness.
   Soviet space officials have put the cost of the Phobos mission
at $480 million.
   In addition to the Soviets, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, East
Germany, Ireland, Poland, Finland, France, West Germany,
Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Sweden, the United States and the
European Space Agency are participating in the flight. The United
States, a late entry, will provide tracking data with its Deep
Space Network that can determine distances within yards and the
velocity of objects billions of miles from Earth.
   The Phobos craft also will carry a plaque commemorating the
moon's discovery by an American astronomer.

   A labor dispute that stood between about 1,000
Democratic National Convention delegates and their hotel rooms has
been settled, much to the relief of party officials scurrying for a
contingency plan.
   ``We're out of the pup-tent business,'' said Peter Kelly,

   The delegation, along with those from Louisiana, Tennessee and
Wyoming, had decided against crossing picket lines, which members

they would form if their contract dispute could not be resolved.
   Hilton General Manager Andre Shaefer said a one-year agreement

   ``We came to an agreement, and that means no picketing,''
Shaefer said. ``It's something we didn't want.''

   A radical Shiite Moslem group that holds
two American hostages said Thursday their fate will be part of
Iran's revenge for the shooting down of an Iranian airliner in
which 290 people were killed.
   ``Everybody knows that all the strong cards are still in our
hand, including the hostages issue, which will be part of a
comprehensive response that will make the killers and their
partners pay the price,'' said a statement from the Revolutionary
Justice Organization. It was not more specific.
   Missiles fired by the U.S. missile cruiser Vincennes destroyed
the airliner Sunday over the Persian Gulf.
   The typewritten statement in Arabic was delivered to a Western
news agency in Beirut with a photocopy of a page from hostage
Edward Austin Tracy's U.S. passport.
   Revolutionary Justice says it is holding Tracy and another
American, Joseph James Cicippio.
   ``We have monitored all the positions denouncing or supporting
the American crime,'' the statement said. ``We consider whoever has
denounced it a friend to the peoples of the area and whoever has
supported it a partner.''
   In threats directed at President Reagan, it said: ``We will
fight you. We will torture you with our hands. You will not know
where, when and how torture and death will face you.''
   On Oct. 21, 1986, the group calling itself the Revolutionary
Justice Organization claimed responsibility for kidnapping Tracy,
57, a writer from Rutland, Vt.
   Cicippio, 58, acting comptroller at the American University of
Beirut, was abducted Sept. 12, 1986. He is from Valley Forge, Pa.
   Eighteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are captives in
Lebanon, and most believed in the hands of Shiite extremists loyal
to Iran. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The photocopy, apparently intended to authenticate Thursday's
statement, showed the passport page bearing Tracy's photograph,
name and date of birth.
   It said the shooting down of the Iran Air jetliner ``was not the
first time America killed children, women and other innocent
civilians and will not be the last one.''
   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization stresses that the
presence of these (U.S.) fleets and their crimes will certainly
reflect on the safety of the American presence all over the
world.'' the statement said.
   Revolutionary Justice, Islamic Jihad and other Shiite groups
holding hostages are believed to be affiliated with the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   A telephone caller who said he spoke for Islamic Jihad
threatened on Tuesday to kill one of the two American captives it
holds and dump the body in a west Beirut neighborhood. Police said
later the call was a hoax.
   Islamic Jihad holds Anderson, 40, and educator Thomas
Sutherland, 57, acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut. He was abducted June 9, 1985.

   The United States on Thursday welcomed a new
plan announced by South Korea to ease tensions with North Korea,
calling it a ``very constructive and forward-looking policy.''
   Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley expressed
hope that North Korea will respond positively to the six-point plan
announced by President Roh Tae-woo.
   She said the U.S. goals on the Korean peninsula include a
reduction of tensions between the two countries, discouraging North
Korean recourse to terrorism and a dialogue leading to peaceful
reunification of North and South Korea.
   ``We welcome the very constructive and forward-looking policy
which President Roh has announced,'' Mrs. Oakley said. She added
that that United States has no immediate plans to take steps of its
own.
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea
and prohibits U.S. diplomats from engaging in substantive contacts
with North Korean envoys.
   That restriction had been loosened in 1987 but was reinstated
last fall after North Korean agents were blamed for the bombing of
a South Korean passenger plane over Burma.
   North Korean requests to visit the United States are generally
turned down, but Mrs. Oakley said an exception was made recently
when a delegation of North Korean technical experts was allowed to
attend an international conference on dams in San Francisco.

him to the Shrine of Our Lady of Knock to pray for ``peace with
justice'' in Northern Ireland.
   But limited accommodations in Knock, a small town where the
Virgin Mary is believed to have appeared in 1879, forced organizers
to limit the trip to about 1,500 people. Those who have said they

   Actress Mercedes McCambridge, whose son

lawsuit that she should not be required to make restitution to a
company for money lost on investments by her son.
   Ms. McCambridge filed the complaint as a third-party plaintiff
in a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Stephens Inc. investment banking
firm of Little Rock. The suit alleged that the Chicago investment
banking firm of Geldermann Inc. was negligent in its handling of
commodities futures orders made by Ms. McCambridge's son, John
Markle.
   Markle, of Little Rock, was fired in November from his post as
commodities trader for Stephens. Stephens says Markle placed orders
with Geldermann, then assigned profitable transactions to an
account in his mother's name while unprofitable ones went to
Stephens.
   Ms. McCambridge is seeking $1.1 million compensatory damages and
$5 million punitive damages from Stephens, Geldermann, and the
executor of her son's estate.
   Police said Markle shot his wife and two children while they
slept, then killed himself on Nov. 16.

<HEAD>Defiant Arabs Turn in Identity Cards To Protest Tax Raid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN IZENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIT SAHOUR, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Palestinians
turned in their army-issued identity cards Thursday to protest a
pre-dawn raid by Israeli tax collectors.
   The Palestinian action was an unprecedented gesture of defiance
by Arabs toward military authorities in the occupied lands.
   Non-payment of taxes has become one of the chief civil
disobedience tactics used by Palestinians in the uprising against
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip that began Dec.
8.
   In Beit Sahour, near Bethlehem, Israeli tax collectors
accompanied by about 300 troops entered the homes of 50 residents
at 5 a.m., seized their identity cards, and said they wouldn't be
returned until the Palestinians paid their back taxes.
   Troops also impounded the cars of some Arabs, apparently for
nonpayment of vehicle licensing and other fees.
   The move prompted about 250 other Arab residents to hand in
their identity cards in protest.
   Palestinians are required to carry identity papers at all times
and face immediate arrest if caught without them. The cards also
must be presented when requesting permits to travel abroad or other
government services.
   An official of Israel's West Bank military government said there
had been no previous incidents of large numbers of Palestinians
returning identity cards in protest even though a number of
underground leaflets have called for such action.
   An army official said there was a large gathering outside city
hall which dispersed without military intervention. He declined
further comment.
   Dozens of Beit Sahour residents streamed into town hall to turn
over the orange-colored cards, which filled a large drawer.
   At one point, Palestinians broke into loud cheers and applause
when Abdullah Mousta, the mukhtar or leading town elder, handed
over his papers.
   In their latest leaflet, uprising leaders ordered Palestinians
not to pay taxes to ``escalate the uprising and bring us closer to
total civil disobedience.''
   On Thursday, Beit Sahour residents were told to report to a
girls' high school where departments were set up for collecting
back income taxes, value-added taxes and vehicle licensing fees.
   Few residents turned up to settle their bills. Some said they
could not afford to pay what they owed, and others said they
refused to pay out of defiance.
   ``The Israelis are asking the impossible,'' said a Palestinian
who would only give his first name, Abdullah. ``We can't afford it.
We live in very difficult conditions.''
   Narri Kheir, a carpenter, said the army ordered him to pay
$2,000 in taxes although he had not worked for three months.
   A woman, who refused to be identified, said many residents were
no longer afraid of Israeli punishments. ``We have nothing to lose
any more,'' she said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, said the first
firebomb attack in Jewish west Jerusalem since the uprising began
showed that Arabs were intent on destroying Israel.
   There were no casualties in the Wednesday night attack on an
Israeli passenger bus in the central commercial district of Jewish
west Jerusalem.
   ``The uprising is not about the question of territory ... but
about our very existence,'' Shamir told Israel radio. ``This shows
the growing nerve of hostile elements who dare to do such a thing
in the center of the state of Israel.''
   Mayor Teddy Kollek described the firebombing as ``a terrible
danger for the present and the future.''
   Although stone-throwing and firebomb attacks have escalated
recently in Arab east Jerusalem, where 135,000 Arabs live, the
attack marked the first time violence has spread to west Jerusalem,
where about 340,000 Jews live.
   Also Wednesday, assailants threw a rock from the roof of the
largest commercial center in Tel Aviv, damaging the roof of a car.
Police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said police blamed Arabs and rounded
up five residents of the occupied Gaza Strip for questioning. Four
were later released.
   The trial of Hanna Siniora, editor of the pro-Palestine
Liberation Organization daily, Al Fajr, began Thursday in a
Jerusalem District Court.
   Siniora was charged with violating censorship laws last year for
publishing an interview with PLO leader Yasser Arafat without first
submitting it to the military censor.
   Siniora has advocated an Arab civil disobedience campaign.

<HEAD>Another Car Bomb In Afghan Capital Kills One</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second car bomb in two days went
off Thursday in Afghanistan's capital, killing one person, Kabul
radio reported. Six died in the explosion a day earlier.
   In a late report about a guerrilla rocket attack on the city
Wednesday, Western diplomats said a West German free-lance
journalist was among the wounded. The diplomats, who spoke on
condtiion of anonymity, did not give his name.
   Kabul radio said seven people were killed in the rocket attack
Wednesday afternoon. The car bomb that killed six people exploded
earlier in the day near the building that houses the Communist
Party Central Committee.
   Western diplomats and leaders of Moslem guerrillas fighting the
Communist government say security around Kabul has deteriorated
since the Soviet Union began pulling its troops out of Afghanistan
under an agreement mediated by the United Nations.
   Diplomats said Thursday they had confirmation of reports that
guerrillas captured Mohammad Agha, a district capital 25 miles
south of Labul in Logar province. It is astride the Logar Road,
which the sources described as the only remaining secure route
south from Kabul.
   U.N. envoy Diego Cordovez, who negotiated the withdrawal
agreement in Geneva, met in Kabul on Thursday with Afghan leader
Najib, who uses only one name. Cordovez is due in Islamabad on
Friday.
   The agreement was signed April 14 by Pakistan and Afghanistan,
with the United States and Soviet Union as guarantors. The
insurgents, who are supported by the United States, were left out
of the negotiations and have said they will ignore the resulting
accord.
   Afghan guerrillas began fighting after a Communist coup in April
1978, and Soviet military forces entered the country in December
1979. More than 5 million Afghans have fled the country, and at
least 3 million live along the border in Pakistan.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in Afghanistan when
the Geneva agreement was signed. They began withdrawing May 15 and
all are to be gone by Feb. 15, 1989.

   More hospital waste, including intravenous
tubing and vials of blood, washed ashore today on a Long Island
beach, and officials declared it off-limits for swimmers just a few
hours after it was reopened.
   Swimming bans were lifted today on other beaches along a 25-mile
stretch of the island's south shore, facing the Atlantic Ocean, but
officials warned that winds and tides could bring more debris and
force more closings.
   There was no word on where the material came from.
   Meanwhile in New Jersey, officials said Wednesday that five of
the 104 blood-filled vials that washed up on its shores last
weekend contained AIDS-contaminated blood. Another two dozen vials
were found Wednesday.
   The waves of debris that washed up today at Robert Moses State
Park, the easternmost of the affected beaches, were brought in by a
combination of high tide and southwesterly winds, said Michael
Asheroff, deputy regional director of the Long Island State Park
Commission.
   The waste was taken to the state Department of Environmental
Conservation for testing to determine its source.
   Asheroff said the popular Jones Beach and the other beaches
closed Wednesday and then reopened may see waste washing ashore
later this afternoon or by high tide Friday morning.
   Health inspectors, after finding no new debris on beaches this
morning, had decided to reopen them. They also tested the water
quality and found it to be safe, Asheroff said.
   Inspectors from the Suffolk and Nassau county health departments
and the state Department of Environmental Conservation were in
patrol boats looking for clues to the origin of the debris.
   On Wednesday, the Nassau County Health Department recommended
that the state, county and town beaches remain closed to swimming
until the water was determined safe, said Shelly Domash, a
department spokeswoman.
   ``It's the unknown _ you don't know what it is or what it's
carrying,'' said Ronald F. Foley, regional director of the New York
State Parks. ``We wanted to be on the safe side.''
   On a typical weekday, 50,000 to 60,000 people visit Jones Beach
and Robert Moses state parks, with up to 15 percent swimming, he
said. On weekends, as many as 200,000 go to Jones Beach and about
40,000 to Robert Moses, which is 10 miles east.
   A heat wave has just begun, with forecasters predicting
temperatures in the 90s through the weekend.
   Domash said officials were trying to figure out where the debris
came from and whether it was related to the debris that washed up
in New Jersey.
   The last time the parks' beaches were closed in New York was
1976 when sewage washed up, Foley said.
   The New Jersey Health Department announced Wednesday that five
vials discovered last weekend in Bayonne showed evidence of the
AIDS antibody. It was the second time in a month that vials had
washed ashore in New Jersey.
   The presence of the antibody ``does not necessarily indicate
that there is live virus in the blood,'' said Deputy Health
Commissioner Thomas A. Burke.
   Early last month, two of five vials found in Ocean County were
contaminated with AIDS. A third tested positive for hepatitis,
which is substantially more infectious than AIDS.
   Police also said Wednesday they have discovered another two
dozen vials on the Bayonne beach which have been turned over to the
Health Department for analysis. Bayonne is on a bay that feeds into
the Atlantic Ocean.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian-backed Palestinian guerrillas
overran most of a refugee camp Thursday in an assault aimed at
driving loyalists of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat out of their last
stronghold in Beirut, police said.
   At least 14 people died and 36 others were wounded in the
five-hour assault on the Bourj el-Barajneh refugee camp, police
said. According to police count, 174 people have been killed and
665 wounded since the fighting broke out May 1.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the dissident Fatah-Uprising faction backed by a
fierce mortar and rocket barrage moved into western and southern
sectors of the camp.
   Arafat's fighters were cornered on the eastern side of the
devastated camp.
   Fighting died down about midday. Reporters who visited the camp
saw Mousa's jubilant guerrillas cleaning debris from the main
street.
   The commander of Fatah in the camp, Sultan Abul-Ainen, asked
leftist Lebanese militia leaders to ``guarantee the safe
evacuation'' of his men, estimated at about 100, police said.
   The police spokesman said leaders of the Druse Progressive
Socialist Party, the Lebanese Communist Party and the Syrian Social
Nationalist Party have ``agreed to sponsor the evacuation.'' No
timetable has been announced yet, he said.
   Arafat has been trying for three years to rebuild the power base
he lost after Israel's invaded Lebanon in 1982.
   His fighters pushed Mousa's faction out of Bourj el-Barajneh and
a nearby camp, Chatilla, in early May.
   But the dissidents regrouped and began shelling the camps with
artillery, rockets and heavy mortars from Syrian-held positions in
the mountains surrounding Beirut. The camps already were devastated
by attacks from Israelis, Lebanese Christians and Syrian-backed
Shiite Moslem militiamen in the last six years.
   Fatah-Uprising fighters, led by Col. Saeed Mousa, forced Arafat
loyalists out of Chatilla on June 27.
   Arafat's guerrillas had repulsed at least 21 major attacks since
Monday, when fighting flared after a weeklong lull in the power
struggle for control of the camps.
   But Arafat's fighters lacked the heavy weapons to retaliate for
the daily shelling.
   The police spokesman said Arafat's guerrillas would probably be
driven in police buses to the port city of Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut, where the Palestine Liberation Organization has bases.
   Syrian soldiers would escort the guerrillas to the Awali bridge
just north of Sidon, he added. The bridge is the Syrian army's
southernmost position in Lebanon.
   The camp, which once housed more than 40,000 refugees, was in
ruins. Not a single shack has escaped the shellfire.
   The four-story Haifa Hospital, the camp's only medical center,
has been shelled repeatedly. All its doors and windows were blown
out.
   Hospital beds and other equipment were scattered in the street,
apparently hurled there by the blast of exploding shells. The
hospital was evacuated Tuesday.
   The few civilians who remained in Bourj el-Barajneh were seen
packing up what was left of their households and fleeing through
the smoking rubble.
   ``We're proud Palestinians. We don't want to live with traitors.
We will go wherever the PLO can take care of us,'' said a woman who
identified herself only as Fawziyeh.
   Mousa and other radical factions broke away from the Palestine
Liberation Organization in a 1983 Syrian-backed mutiny and
established headquarters in Damascus.
   The power struggle between Fatah and Mousa's guerrillas erupted
less than a week after Arafat flew to Damascus for a reconciliation
with President Hafez Assad of Syria to end a 5-year-old feud over
control of the Palestinian movement.
   The PLO has claimed that Syria was behind the latest fighting to
drive Arafat's forces out of Beirut.
   Arafat's men have regrouped in bases in Palestinian camps in
south Lebanon, which is dominated by Shiite Moslems, raising the
specter of more violence.

   Kymber Doran, who had been free on a $100,000 personal surety

   A U.S. marshal had found the address book and was thumbing
through it to find its owner when he found a small packet of white
powder wrapped in paper, federal prosecutors said.
   Federal Magistrate Lurana Snow then ordered detention for Ms.
Doran, who had left the courtroom without the book and then
returned.
   Ms. Snow asked Drug Enforcement Administration agents to test
the powder. It tested positive for cocaine, officials said.
   Ms. Doran, 26, worked in Fort Lauderdale IRS office when she was
arrested in May on a charge of conspriracy and possession with the
intent to distribute cocaine. She has pleaded innocencent and is
awaiting trial on that charge.
   Wednesday's hearing was to discuss a trial date.

   The mother and her brood weren't blocking traffic, but
rubbernecking drivers on both sides of the freeway slowed for a

<HEAD>GOP Consultant: Bush's Gender Gap Problem Could Beat Him In
November</HEAD>

   A Republican political consultant said
Thursday that George Bush will lose in November if he doesn't get
the support of more women, and that even a woman running mate would
not help substantially.
   The problem of ``gender gap'' is so serious that overcoming it
is probably the most important demographic key to a Bush victory,
said Doug Bailey, a respected GOP consultant.
   ``If he doesn't bridge the gender gap he will not win ... There
are not enough white men available for George Bush to win this
election,'' Bailey said.
   Bailey predicted that Bush, the likely Republican nominee, will
win, however, by making changes in his campaign strategy to make
him more appealing to women voters.
   He said the campaign's emphasis on Bush's past government and
military experience does not appeal to women, whose primary
concerns tend to be economic issues affecting work and family.
   ``There's nothing wrong with playing baseball at Yale, and there
surely is nothing wrong with serving your country and being a
genuine war hero and there's nothing wrong with being director of
the CIA,'' Bailey said.
   ``But frankly, that is a biography that links up dramatically
with male instincts, and male interests and male priorities. It
says nothing positive about linking up that agenda of issues ... of
highest priority to women voters,'' he said.
   He recommended that the vice president concentrate on making his
own family more visible at campaign appearances, and make a more
forceful commitment to issues like long-term health care, job
security and education.
   Bailey spoke at a news conference called by the National
Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs, which
released an analysis on the gender gap, a term used to describe
differences in men and women's political preferences and behavior.
   The study looked at recent polls which have shown that women are
more pessimistic than men about the economy and thus more likely to
vote against the current administration, as represented by Bush.
Polls show male voters generally split between Bush and likely
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, while women voters are more
likely to lean toward Dukakis.
   ``The perception is that Michael Dukakis is respectful of women
and George Bush is not,'' she said.
   Bailey acknowledged that the ``gender gap numbers over the first
six months of this year have been disaster for Bush.''
   Asked about the impact of the selection of a women vice
presidential candidate on the Republican ticket, Bailey said that
it could be negative if it is perceived as a symbolic act done
because of the polls.
   ``Frankly, I do not think that the selection of a woman for vice
president would do more than a marginal job,'' Bailey said.
   Ethel Klein, a political science professor at Columbia
University who prepared the analysis, noted that polls in recent
weeks have shown more women undecided and that Dukakis' support
among women had eroded somewhat.
   Much of Dukakis' support comes from anti-Bush sentiment, and
substantial numbers of both men and women are ``not sure at this
time that either of these men are suited to be president,'' she
said.
   In any case, women's votes will be crucial in November ``if this
presidential election is as close as many analysts are
predicting,'' she said.

<HEAD>Many Goals For Infant, Maternal Health Not Being Met</HEAD>

   Most of the nation's top goals for babies and
pregnant women _ including a hoped-for reduction in the infant
mortality rate _ will not be met by the 1990 target date, federal
health officials said Thursday.
   ``It's certainly sobering and concerning,'' said Dr. Ann Koontz,
a specialist with the Health Resources and Services Administration
in Rockville, Md. ``This indicates that we have some significant
problems relating to maternal and infant health.''
   The government in 1979 published its 1990 health objectives for
the nation, including 13 top-priority goals relating to pregnancy
and infant health. Only three of those 13 goals are likely to be
met, the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday in its
weekly report.
   The CDC, using National Center for Health Statistics data,
projects that the nation's infant mortality rate _ infants dying
before age 1 _ will be 9.1 per 1,000 live births. That's a drop
from the 10.6 rate in 1985, but still short of the 9.0 rate in the
1990 objectives.
   Based on data from 1970-81, health officials had projected a
1990 infant mortality rate of 7.8, but ``the decline in the infant
mortality rate has slowed,'' the CDC said.
   The reasons are not known, Ms. Koontz said. ``It's a very
complex field,'' she said. ``We'd all like to see improvements, but
there's not been a simple solution.''
   Another objective says that no racial or ethnic group should
have an infant mortality rate worse than 12 per 1,000. Among black
Americans, the rate stood at 18.2 in 1985 and is projected to
decline only to 15.9 by 1990, the CDC said.
   The infant mortality rate among whites stood at 9.3 per 1,000 in
1985 and is projected to fall to 7.9 by 1990, the CDC noted.
   Although economics may play a part in the discrepancy between
blacks' and whites' infant mortality rates _ ``We know that poor
economic circumstances are distributed disproportionately among
minority populations,'' Ms. Koontz said _ the complete reason is
not clear, she added.
   Previous studies have shown that among college-educated mothers,
black infants still have nearly twice the mortality rate of
comparable white infants, she noted.
   ``A lot of attention is being given to try to discern what's
accounting for the differences,'' she said. ``Those answers aren't
readily available.''
   One of the goals that is likely to be met concerns the nation's
neonatal mortality rate _ babies dying in the first 28 days of
life. That rate is projected to be 5.7 per 1,000 in 1990, below the
target of 6.5.
   The other two objectives likely to be met are having most babies
leave the hospital in car safety seats _ a 1987 survey put the
figure at 75 percent _ and putting into place programs to screen
newborns for metabolic disorders, which all states now have, the
CDC said.
   Among the other goals not likely to be met:
   _ Reducing the perinatal death rate _ deaths between 28 weeks'
gestation and the first seven days after birth _ to less than 5.5
per 1,000. The 1990 projection: 8.5.
   _ No county, racial or ethnic group should have a maternal death
rate above five per 100,000 live births. The 1990 national rate is
projected at 7.0, with black mothers at 20.5.
   _ No more than 5 percent of babies should be born under 2,500
grams, or 5.5 pounds. The 1990 projection: 6.7 percent.
   _ No county, racial or ethnic group should have a
low-birth-weight rate over 9 percent. For blacks, the 1990
projection is 12.3 percent.
   _ No more than 10 percent of pregnant women in any county,
racial or ethnic group should go without prenatal care in the first
three months of pregnancy. The 1990 national projection: 23.6
percent, 38.5 percent for blacks.
   The CDC said insufficient information is available to ascertain
the progress toward the other three priority goals: making 85
percent of the nation's childbearing-age women aware of the hazards
of smoking, drinking and drugs; serving all women and infants in a
regionalized system of perinatal care; and having comprehensive
primary health care available to all infants.

   A sophisticated test that allows
detection of minute amounts of the AIDS virus in people who by
conventional tests appear uninfected is being offered commercially
by two California laboratories.
   The test uses a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or
PCR, in which extremely small amounts of genetic material can be
picked out and quickly copied to provide enough material for
analysis.
   It has been used in rare cases to identify people carrying small
amounts of the AIDS virus but who tested negative on conventional
tests.
   The PCR test does not detect only AIDS, but any tiny amounts of
genetic material. It has previously been available only for
research.
   Cetus Corp., which developed the technique, on Wednesday
announced it has licensed the Pathology Institute in Berkeley and
Specialty Laboratories Inc. in Santa Monica to use the test.
Physicians or laboratories will be able to send them blood samples
for testing, which takes five days and costs about $145.
   The PCR technique is not intended to replace the standard ELISA
test, which detects antibodies to the acquired immune deficiency
syndrom virus.
   In many cases, the AIDS virus does not trigger production of
antibodies for six months or more after the infection has occurred.

   As Michael Dukakis looks over his list of
potential running mates _ seven names by all indications _ no one
of them stands out as an unencumbered choice.
   The Massachusetts governor is expected to announce his choice
next week, before the opening of the Democratic National Convention
where he will be named the party's presidential nominee.
   Dukakis was on a Western campaign swing on Thursday, scheduled
to return to Boston on Sunday. Aides said he was taking Monday off,
but the expectation was he would use that time to go over the
material gathered by Paul Brountas, the close friend and lawyer who
has been heading the veep search.
   The following names are understood to be on the Dukakis list:
Jesse Jackson, Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas,
Bob Graham of Florida and Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, and Reps.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Indiana.
   Three other names were on the Dukakis list _ Sens. Sam Nunn of
Georgia and Bill Bradley of New Jersey and House Majority Leader
Tom Foley of Washington. All three said no thanks.
   It's always possible that the buttoned-down Dukakis could
surprise everyone and choose someone whose name has made no lists.
But the known universe is the above-named seven. Each has been
asked for detailed personal and financial information and each has
met privately with the governor.
   While strong cases can be made for each, it often is the
negatives that play a key role in determining the choice. In other
words, it often is as much a process of elimination as of selection.
   Here's a look at the downside of the seven:
   _ Jackson. Despite a campaign in which he was widely praised for
moving into the mainstream of the Democratic Party and addressing
issues of primary concern to white as well as non-white voters,
every national survey has said Jackson would hurt the Democratic
ticket far more than he would help it.
   Dukakis is a highly disciplined individual and would expect his
running mate to be equally controlled, an expectation that would be
impossible with the volatile Jackson.
   _ Glenn. The former astronaut and Marine pilot is a genuine
national hero who would give the ticket an image of strength on
defense. Polls indicate Glenn helps the ticket in nearly every
section of the country. But Glenn has always done better in the
polls than at the ballot box. He ran a disastrous campaign for
president in 1984 and still owes more than $2 million. Another rap
against him was best expressed by Jimmy Carter in 1976. After
meeting Glenn, Carter reportedly told aides, ``He's the most boring
man I've ever met.''
   _ Bentsen. No Democrat has been elected president this century
without carrying Bentsen's home state of Texas, which has the third
largest number of electoral votes _ 29. But Texas also is George
Bush's home state and there is no guarantee Bentsen would carry the
state for the Democratic ticket. In addition, Bentsen is up for
re-election. The old Lyndon B. Johnson law remains in effect _
legislation passed in 1960 to permit Johnson to run for re-election
to the Senate while he also was running for vice president. But
times have changed and an effort to go for a double could cost
Bentsen his Senate seat.
   _ Graham. Graham would probably give the Democratic ticket
Florida's 21 electoral votes. But he's little known outside his
home state and is only in his second year in the Senate. If Dukakis
is looking for Washington experience to balance the ticket, Graham
seems an unlikely choice.
   _ Gore. ``Damaged goods'' is the phrase some Dukakis advisers
use to describe the Tennessee senator, a reference to his failed
presidential campaign. A major argument Gore used during his
campaign earlier this year was that Dukakis represented the
Mondale-McGovern wing of the party. George McGovern and Walter
Mondale share the distinction of having lost 49 states as
Democratic presidential nominees. It was a comparison that didn't
sit well with Dukakis.
   _ Gephardt. Another failed challenger for the presidential
nomination, Gephardt ran well in Iowa and creditably in New
Hampshire, but then bombed out. His Japan-bashing rhetoric on trade
was sharply different from the Dukakis approach. He also was seen
as too willing to play special interest politics.
   _ Hamilton. ``Well respected'' is the term often used to
describe this senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
``Boring'' is another. Virtually unknown outside his district,
Hamilton couldn't even guarantee Dukakis Indiana's 12 electoral
votes.

<TEXT>
   An 88-year-old woman who sat on her porch
for a month, waiting to die, has been taken by her stepchildren for
a bath and a checkup.
   Annie Jeffrey, who cannot walk, was spending Thursday at a
neighbor's home.
   ``Older people are going to be defiant but from what I've seen
here, she's not fine,'' said a stepdaughter, Roxie Harris of San
Francisco. ``She did have some objections but we decided to go on
in and take her away from the house.''
   Mrs. Harris said she and two other stepchildren have tried for
years to get Mrs. Jeffrey to live with them. ``We've been very
concerned about her, but she wouldn't let us do anything, wouldn't
let us take her back. We were here last year to clean up the house
or either to buy a mobile home to put on the lot, but she was
determined that we wouldn't do that.''
   Then, Mrs. Jeffrey could walk and seemed able to care for
herself, Mrs. Harris said. ``What I've seen here is a totally
different individual.''
   The stepchildren, all of whom live in other states, were
contacted by neighbors concerned about Mrs. Jeffrey's physical
condition, rundown house and cluttered yard. While Mrs. Jeffrey sat
on the rotted porch, neighbors took her food each day and tried to
persuade her to leave.
   She now has seen a doctor and taken a bath, but no decision has
been made on where she will go when her stepchildren leave.
   ``I feel so much better. I can sleep now,'' said the Rev. A.L.
Jones of Montevallo, who tried to get help for her. He said that
since she did not want to leave her home, he could do little
besides checking on her condition.

   Federal health officials reported Thursday the
nation's first case of human anthrax since 1984 _ in a textile
worker believed infected by contaminated cashmere.
   A 42-year-old maintenance man at a North Carolina mill became
ill last July with a small red lesion on his arm, and developed
pain, fever and chills over the following week, the Centers for
Disease Control reported. He was diagnosed with a cutaneous form of
anthrax, a severe and potentially fatal disease most common in
cattle and sheep.
   Only nine human cases have occurred in the United States in the
last decade, none since 1984, the CDC said.
   The patient, who recovered, hadn't recently been out of North
Carolina or been exposed to animals or animal materials. However,
the CDC noted, his mill uses wool imported from Australia and New
Zealand, cashmere goat hair from China, Afghanistan and Iran, and
camel hair from China and Mongolia.
   Eight of 59 textile samples tested at the mill _ including five
samples of West Asian cashmere _ showed contamination with anthrax
bacteria, the CDC said in its weekly report.
   ``The West Asian cashmere was probably the contaminant,'' the
CDC reported. ``Western Asia is an endemic area for anthrax.''
   The other three contaminated samples were either debris or
Australian wool which may have been cross-contaminated while stored
near the cashmere, the Atlanta-based agency said.
   ``This case demonstrates that the potential for occupational
transmission of (anthrax) ... still exists,'' the CDC said.
   Vaccination programs were recommended for workers at the North
Carolina plant and at a Texas plant where the cashmere was washed,
said the CDC, which, as is its custom, did not identify the
locations involved.

   The stone likenesses of four presidents
carved into a mountain at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in
the Black Hills have made a cameo appearance in a Hitchcock film
and inspired President Reagan to recite a poem.
   ``Mount Rushmore is not simply a tribute to four men, but rather
is a memorial to the ideas they represent,'' Rep. Tim Johnson,
D-S.D., said at a ceremony last year celebrating the 50th
anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's 66-foot face. ``Mount Rushmore is
not a place of stoic stone faces. It's a place of dreams.''
   The monumental visages of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt, can be seen for 60 miles.
   Mount Rushmore is the No. 1 tourist attraction in South Dakota,
with more than 2 million visitors a year. Custer State Park draws 1
million people a year and ranks third in the state's $520 million
tourism industry.
   Gutzon Borglum began work on the monument in 1927, but died in
1941 shortly before it was completed. His helper and son, Lincoln
Borglum, finished the work.
   The national memorial, which occupies 1,275 acres, is two miles
west of Keystone and about 20 miles southwest of Rapid City.
Keystone was evacuated Wednesday night as a brushfire headed toward
the memorial, but the monument was reopened on Thursday.
   The monument was the scene of a climactic final battle in
``North By Northwest,'' Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1959 thriller
starring Cary Grant.
   It has also been the scene of protest. Last October, five
members of the environmental group Greenpeace were arrested when
they illegally climbed Mount Rushmore and tried to unfurl a
160-foot by 50-foot banner reading ``We The People Say No To Acid
Rain.''
   In October 1986, Reagan was moved after flying over the monument
in Air Force One.
   ``I may gaze on planets born of farther suns,'' Reagan recited.
   ``I may greater glories one day see.
   ``But today, dear Earth, how I love thee.''

   A shower a day helps keep the drought at
bay, and a little soap in hand doesn't hurt.
   Frank Reeves has rigged up a portable shower on his front lawn.
Several mornings a week, he trots outside in his swimsuit, connects
the garden hose and lathers up with biodegradable soap.
   ``I feel sorry for my lawn,'' said Reeves, 41, a corporate
lawyer. ``I think my lawn needs the water more than the city sewer
system does.''
   Nashville has no restrictions on outside water use, but Reeves
is doing his bit for conservation with his shower.
   ``I've been using it for a shower and lawn-waterer
intermittently for about three weeks now,'' he said.
   Reeves moves the shower to a different spot each day but the
dousings aren't enough to water his entire lawn. He limits the
watering to specific flowers and trees.
   ``Any other water the lawn gets is from whatever spray or
overflow it happens to get from what little plant watering we do,''
he said.

   The San Francisco Chronicle reported in Thursday's editions that
W. Glenn Campbell said he has invited Meese to discuss an
affiliation with the institution, located at Stanford University.
   Campbell said he would like to see Meese, who has resigned as
attorney general effective later this summer, serve ``as a
distinguished visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution so that he
can have some time to write the book that he should write.''
   He noted that Secretary of State George Shultz plans to serve in
such a capacity.
   ``It would be very good to also have Ed Meese in the coffee room
so that the scholars learn that translating their ideas into policy
and action isn't quite as simple as they think it is, particularly
when you're subjectd to continuing media harassment.
   ``I think personally he's got a lot more to offer in terms of
the Reagan legacy than some of the people currently on the lecture
circuit,'' Campbell added.

   The Dukakis administration on Thursday offered $5
million for land designated for a prison, but the owners demanded
nearly twice as much money and vowed a court fight if the state
acquires the property by eminent domain.
   ``This bid is simply too low for us to seriously consider,''
co-owner Daniel Striar said after a brief meeting with state
officials. ``We feel confident that the property has a market value
of over $9 million.''
   The controversy over the planned medium-security prison on 782
acres in rural New Braintree has become a political embarrassment
for all-but-certain Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis.
   The FBI is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by
prison opponents that Striar and co-owner Gary Jacobson bought the
land after receiving a tip about the state's interest. Dukakis and
the owners have dismissed the charges.
   The Massachusetts governor also has continued to back the
proposal for the 500-bed prison.
   ``If negotiations are not successful, we will move to take the
property by eminent domain,'' Dukakis said.
   Striar and Jacobson stood by the $9.6 million price they asked
for when they first offered the land to the state in 1986, less
than a year after they bought it for $3 million. On the property is
a building that once served as a religious academy, 20 homes and
more than 700 acres of farmland.
   A preliminary state appraisal estimated the land's value at $8.7
million.
   Opponents of the prison, led by New Braintree selectwoman
Dorothea Thomas-Vitrac, cited those figures to support claims that
the state sought out the developers as middlemen in the land deal
and would reward them with a whopping profit.
   Three subsequent, more detailed appraisals that were
commissioned by the state, placed the value of the land at about $5
million. Two appraisals put its worth at exactly $5 million; the
third at $4.98 million.
   The state's offering price was based on those appraisals, which
took into account an environmental impact study that said the state
would have to build a sewage treatment plant on the land if it
located a prison there.
   If negotiations for the property do not resume and the state
seeks to claim the land through eminent domain, the owners can
contest the state's offering price in court. Michael Goldman, a
spokesman for Jacobson and Striar, said the owners would take legal
action.

   President Reagan and Vice President George
Bush, seeking to limit public disagreements, directed their chiefs
of staff Thursday to coordinate campaign policy pronouncements and
strategy.
   ``I think everyone agrees that the main issue is, `No
surprises,''' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in
describing a luncheon that Reagan, Bush and aides had in the White
house residence.
   ``Keeping them informed of our policy moves and vice versa would
be a key element,'' he said. ``We didn't talk about specific
issues.''
   Fitzwater said Reagan's policy decisions would not be driven by
consideration of how they would affect Bush's prospects.
   ``The president makes his decisions on the merits, on what he
thinks is best for the country,'' he said. ``On the other hand,
it's also important to know what the vice president's positions
are, how the campaign is framing certain actions and so forth.''
   At the luncheon, he said, Reagan reiterated that he expects Bush
to ``present his own approach to the problems'' of the 1990s. And
he said Reagan acknowledged ``their previously reached
understanding that the vice president will want to take positions
during the campaign that may differ from the president and
administration policy.''
   But the spokesman also said that beginning Monday, a
coordinating team headed by White House chief of staff Kenneth
Duberstein and Bush chief of staff Craig Fuller will meet at least
once weekly.
   Fuller has been sitting in on White House staff meetings. But
the new committee, Fitzwater said, would be aimed specifically at
making sure neither Reagan nor Bush is blind-sided by the other, to
the extent possible in a campaign in which Bush will be on the road
much of the time.
   Fitzwater would not say whether formation of the coordinating
group resulted from differences that have arisen between Reagan and
Bush on such issues as the Civil Rights Restoration Act and U.S.
strategy for ousting Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Taking part in Thursday's meeting besides Reagan, Bush,
Duberstein and Fuller were Stuart Spencer, a longtime Reagan
political adviser; former Sen. Paul Laxalt, a Reagan confidant; Lee
Atwater, Bush's campaign manager; pollster Robert Teeter; White
House political adviser Frank Donatelli, Fitzwater and Sheila Tate,
the Bush campaign press secretary.
   Fitzwater said that Reagan outlined to Bush the themes he would
like to strike during campaign-related appearances, including
patriotism, family values, military strength, less government,
private initiative and lower taxes.
   ``The president feels he can be especially helpful with
conservative Republicans, Democrats and other key groups which are
not registered Republican but which have voted for the Reagan-Bush
ticket in '80 and '84,'' he said.
   Reagan would like to spend at least two days a week campaigning
for Bush this fall, after Congress' recess around Oct. 5, Fitzwater
said.
   He said Reagan may take part in some campaign activities for
Bush on the West Coast during the president's summer vacation in
August.
   Bush said at a news conference in Boston that joint Reagan-Bush
appearances were not discussed at the meeting, ``but I would think
there would be some.''

   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng met with
six farm-state governors Thursday and emerged saying the need for
legislative action to provide drought relief has now become urgent.
   ``There's a need to do something, it would probably take
legislation to do that and there's a need to do it with some
urgency,'' Lyng told a news conference following the session with
governors and key lawmakers.
   Lyng's call for swift action was in marked contrast to past
remarks that Congress should hold off on fashioning a drought
relief package until it is certain of the extent of the damage
wrought by sizzling temperatures and a shortage of rainfall in the
Farm Belt.
   Since he made those remarks several weeks ago, however, the
drought has become more ominous. Spring wheat, oats and barley
already are hard hit in the Grain Belt and authorities forecast
drastic reductions in corn yields unless there is substantial rain
in the Midwest within a week.
   ``It's a critical time when the corn is tasseling and we're in
the pollinating stage,'' said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said after
the meeting. ``Every day that goes by we see a substantial
reduction in yields.''
   Participants in the meeting at offices of the National
Governors' Association said they reached broad agreement on almost
all fronts. They said farmers need more assurance that Congress
will act this year and that therefore bill drafting should begin
quickly.
   ``The decision to act I think is uniform among the people who
were present,'' said North Dakota Gov. George Sinner, chairman of
the association's committee on agriculture and rural development.
``There also was a uniform decision that Congress probably should
address this.''
   Bill-drafting sessions could start as early as next week in both
the House and Senate Agriculture committees, said the chairmen of
those panels, Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, and Sen.
Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
   Also on hand were Govs. George Mickelson of South Dakota, Terry
Branstad of Iowa, Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, John Ashcroft of
Missouri and James Martin of North Carolina. Seven other states
were represented at the session by their lieutenant governors.
   Lyng said there were good prospects that President Reagan would
sign relief legislation if it is a measure ``that is reasonable and
compassionate and will help farmers.''
   Officials said a consensus was forming around a few key
proposals that could well be included in relief legislation. They
said the measure most likely would allow farmers to keep all of the
so-called deficiency payments that they have received in advance.
   Deficiency payments are income-support subsidies. They represent
the difference between the market price of the crop and a target
price set by Congress and adjusted by the secretary of agriculture.
   As the drought has intensified, crop prices have been rising in
anticipation of scarcity later. Thus the gap between market prices
and target prices has shrunk, leaving farmers with smaller payments
at the same time that their crops have been wiped out. Forty
percent of the deficiency payments, however, already were parceled
out in advance to producers.
   ``I think it would be very difficult to collect advance
deficiency payments from farmers who have no income,'' Lyng told
reporters.
   The officials also said that producers of ``non-program'' crops
should also receive relief under the legislation. Soybeans
constitute the largest of these crops, whose producers do not
receive deficiency payments. Various other fruits and vegetables
also are non-program crops.
   The officials were less clear on exactly how much the measure
would cost.
   De la Garza and others emphasized that the cost of the drought
bill would not be able to push the cost of farm subsidies over
their budgeted $17 billion limit. Lawmakers are expecting to save a
considerable sum as a result of the smaller size of deficiency
payments to many farmers.
   This amount in turn could be recycled and paid out in the form
of drought relief, but that still would not take in aid to growers
of non-program crops.
   ``That was discussed in there,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm,
D-Texas. He said it was unsure where the money would come from.
   Governors made clear, however, that some form of relief was
needed.
   ``Farmers in Missouri would face a a real economic disaster from
which they would not recover if we failed to get relief,'' said
Ashcroft. ``We will get relief.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Call For $15 Billion Housing Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Standing in front of a run-down motel where
the government pays for the lodging of homeless families, three
Democratic lawmakers on Thursday called for a $15 billion-a-year
program to create new low-income housing.
   ``We have a responsibility,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told
reporters and homeless activists at the Capital City Inn, a
Washington motel where the government provides room and board for
the homeless at an estimated cost of $3,000 a month per family.
   Under Frank's bill, about $75 billion would be spent over five
years for construction of new housing, renovation of existing
buildings, upgrading of public housing and the acquisition of
additional units.
   Frank, joined by Reps. Kenneth J. Gray, D-Ill, and Floyd Flake,
D-N.Y., said the legislation is not aimed at this year, but for
1989 and the new administration. Frank said he has not discussed
the proposal with Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the
Democrat's expected presidential nominee.
   The lawmakers criticized the Reagan administration's cuts in
housing programs and the increasing government reliance on
vouchers, designed to be used by the poor to go towards paying for
rents in privately owned apartments. They said the vouchers do not
work in cities such as Boston where there are few available
low-cost housing units.
   The legislative program would be self-financing through a
doubling of the cigarette tax, limiting deductions for business
meals and entertainment expenses and other tax adjustments, Frank
said.
   ``We cannot afford not to build more affordable housing,'' said
Flake. ``Homeless are human beings and they have rights too.''
   The legislation was embraced by homeless activists.
   ``This bill can eliminate this place,'' said Mitch Snyder,
pointing to the motel where he said families with four and five
children live in a single room. Windows in the rooms do not open,
forcing residents to leave doors open at night and making them more
vulnerable to crime, Snyder said.
   Organizers from the Community for Creative Non-Violence said
parents or older children must stay awake through the night to
protect infants from rats.
   Officials at the motel, apparently upset by the publicity,
instructed security guards to prevent Snyder and the congressmen
from touring the complex with reporters and TV camera crews in tow.
   ``Tell him to have me arrested,'' Frank snapped at the guard.
The tour continued without incident.
   The group did not go inside any rooms, but walked through a
darkened corridor littered with food and other trash to the back
where Snyder described living conditions.
   Motel manager Fadru Haji declined comment. ``Let them say what
they want to say,'' he said. ``It's a one-sided story.''
   Meanwhile, homeless organizers announced plans for
demonstrations in more than 60 U.S. cities and towns next Thursday
to protest the plight of the homeless.
   Activists plan to occupy abandoned government-owned buildings as
an act of civil disobedience to focus attention on structures that
go unused while some poor have no place to live.
   The Community for Creative Non-Violence said activists also plan
24-hour vigils, rallies and marches.

   The House, grappling with one of its most
sensitive political issues, sidestepped a decision Thursday on
whether to let the Pentagon shut down unneeded military bases.
   The chamber was considering a pair of plans setting up complex
mechanisms and procedures for closing some of the 3,800 military
installations around the nation. Pentagon officials estimate that
between $2 billion and $5 billion annually could be saved by
shutting unneeded bases.
   But after a preliminary test vote, the chamber dropped the bill,
in part because the debate had run longer than scheduled. House
members generally do not work past Thursday afternoons, permitting
members from Western states to return home for election-year
campaigning.
   For the past 11 years, Congress has blocked any base closings
because closings mean lost jobs, and lawmakers have been loath to
see payrolls cut.
   But the federal budget deficit has forced Congess to take
another look at the closings. And Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala.,
noted that this is also a politically opportune time to act.
   ``Many things have come together to make this possible,''
Dickinson said. ``We have a window of opportunity. We have a
lame-duck Congress, we have a lame-duck administration, a lame-duck
secretary of defense.''
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has appointed a nine-member
commission to review the nation's military facilities and decide by
the end of the year which can be closed. That commission has been
meeting for the past two months.
   Under the two plans considered Thursday, the commission would
send its report to President Reagan next Dec. 31, who would then
have until shortly before he leaves office next Jan. 20 to either
accept or reject the entire list. The president could not pick or
choose from among the bases.
   Then, under a plan proposed by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the
bases would be closed starting Jan. 1, 1990, unless both the House
and Senate voted against the list.
   But under the second plan, the closings could not go forward
unless both chambers voted in favor of the plan.
   The second plan was backed by three committees, which jointly
agreed to overhaul the original Armey plan.
   The House, in what House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les
Aspin, D-Wis., called a key test of views on the issue, voted
250-138 in support of an amendment providing that the base closures
would go ahead unless both the House and Senate vote to block them.
   That provision, by Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, is similar to the
plan proposed by Armey. The amendment was added to the
committee-backed bill.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of one of the three panels,
the Government Operations Committee, said Congress should have to
vote to approve any closings.
   The Armey plan ``is designed to circumvent the political
process,'' Brooks told his colleagues.
   But Rep. Constance Morella, R-Md., said the Armey proposal ``is
the only way we can get this done.''
   In addition to requiring an affirmative, rather than a negative
vote, the committee-backed plan would also require the Pentagon to
come up with plans to restore the environment at each outdated
base, along with new studies about the economic impact of the
closings.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, noted that Pentagon budgets ``are declining. The
Congress ought to take every opportunity we can to make sure the
money we spend on defense is spent wisely.''
   In the decades after World War II, when the nation was winding
down from a large-scale military structure, the Pentagon was
generally allowed to do what it wanted on the issue with the
exception of a handful of bases protected by key, powerful members.
Between 1961 and 1977, the Pentagon closed 3,600 installations.
   But in 1975, the Air Force proposed shutting down Loring Air
Force Base in northern Maine. That state's legislators blocked the
procedure by requiring lengthy _ and costly _ environmental impact
studies for the Loring closing and all future closings. Since 1977,
no major facilities have been shut.
   Armey's proposal was defeated last year, 199-192, but he decided
to try again because circumstances were different.
   House approval would send the plan to the Senate, which voted
for its own base-closing plan two months ago.
   That proposal, creating a 15-member commission, was attached to
a Pentagon budget bill, but was later dropped by the House-Senate
conference committee called to resolve differences between the two
chambers over the defense budget.

   Vice President George Bush, hoping to steal
thunder from Michael Dukakis, is likely to break with tradition and
go on the road stumping for votes and media attention during the
Democratic National Convention.
   The plan, Bush said, is to ``get a little bit of ink'' while the
spotlight is on Dukakis and his nomination as the Democrats'
presidential candidate.
   Traditionally, presidential candidates keep a low profile during
the nominating conventions of their rivals. President Reagan, still
playing by those rules although he is not running this year, will
be at his mountaintop ranch in California when the Democrats meet
in Atlanta July 18-21.
   On another campaign matter, Bush and Reagan, seeking to limit
public disagreements, directed their chiefs of staff Thursday to
coordinate campaign policy pronouncements.
   ``I think everyone agrees that the main issue is, `No
surprises,''' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said after
Reagan, Bush and aides met over lunch at the White House.
   Bush said recently he was debating whether to travel during the
Democratic convention. ``I think probably some but _ you know, I
don't know, I don't know what's the right thing to do.''
   On the one hand, Bush said, he'd get news coverage by being on
the road.
   On the other hand, he said, ``you don't want to look like you're
trying to frantically elbow your way into the news cycle.''
   Tentatively, Bush's planners are looking at events on Monday and
Tuesday and Friday and Saturday of Democratic convention week _ the
opening two days of the convention and the two days after it ends.
   Republicans already are planning to send a team of surrogates to
Atlanta to make sure the media hears their point of view.
   Sheila Tate, the vice president's press secretary, said Bush's
schedulers were looking ``mainly at fund-raisers, nuts and bolts
work that's got to get done, and it's a good time to do it.''
   She said that Wednesday and Thursday ``are the big, big days
(for the Democrats) and you keep them open.'' Wednesday night at
the convention is reserved for the presidential nomination and
presidential roll call, while Thursday night is set aside for the
vice presidential nomination, roll call and acceptance speeches.
   At this point, most polls show the Dukakis-Bush race fairly
close. Some surveys show Dukakis ahead by about four points, while
others indicate it is even.
   With all the attention on the Democratic convention, Dukakis is
expected to move ahead of Bush and come away from Atlanta with a
hefty lead over the vice president, perhaps as much as 10 to 15
points, according to Richard Wirthlin, the Reagan's pollster.
   ``The Republicans need some kind of major event, giving George
Bush the focus, the play, the visibility'' after Atlanta, Wirthlin
said.
   He said an obvious thing for Bush to do would be to name his
vice presidential nominee right after the Democratic convention,
robbing Dukakis of the opportunity to bask alone in the limelight.
Bush has said he has not begun to focus on his running mate yet.
   Bush, talking with reporters on Air Force II Wednesday night as
he returned from Dallas, said he would not be idle after he claims
the Republican nomination at the party's convention in New Orleans
Aug. 15-18. He said he is thinking about having meetings in Houston
on campaign strategy and with surrogates.
   He acknowledged that the general election phase of the campaign
will begin ahead of the traditional Labor Day opening and talked
about the demands that will pose.
   ``The physical thing _ I don't want to get too tired. I'd like
to get some time (off) before this last rush to judgment. But I
know physically I can do this.'' He said he was still jogging,
``getting tired but I still feel up to it.
   ``So physically, I'm not too worried about it. I don't want to
get tired and make a lot of mistakes,'' Bush added. ``And if you do
(get tired), as I've found out, you can make mistakes.''
   Referring to Dukakis, who is 54, the 64-year-old vice president
said, ``He will not outwork me. Might do other things more, better,
but he's not going to outwork me. He will not be in better shape
than I am to do the physical part of this thing.''

   Drought-stricken counties no longer will have
to get Washington's approval before approving emergency feed
programs for livestock producers, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   Milton Hertz, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, said each county
committee will have the authority to make the declaration based on
a determination of substantial feed loss in the county.
   Previously, the procedure required the agency's county
committees to submit requests for emergency feed help to the state
office for review. If approved, the state committee would then
forward the request to ASCS headquarters.
   The aid involves the Emergency Feed Program and the Emergency
Feed Assistance Program.
   Under the Emergency Feed Program, the USDA pays eligible
livestock owners a portion of the cost of feed bought to replace
that which is normally produced on the farm. The Emergency Feed
Assistance Program allows the sale of USDA-owned grain at reduced
prices _ 75 percent of the basic county price support loan rate.
   Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa told reporters of the change in
program approval earlier in the day after meeting at USDA with
Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng.
   ``The (drought) counties will not have to make application to
get approval here in Washington for the emergency feed and
emergency feed assistance program,'' Branstad said. ``They can just
notify USDA that they will be providing that (assistance) on an
individual farmer-by farmer basis.''
   Branstand said that to qualify, a farmer will have to show the
county office of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service that he has endured at least a 40 percent loss in normal
feed stocks.
   ``This is going to avoid a lot of confusion and a lot of
questions in the country, that are hurting the livestock
producers,'' he said. ``And I think it is a very positive
development.''
   As of July 6, the feed programs were approved by USDA for 474
counties in 22 states. Overall, 1,844 counties in 37 states are on
the department's drought list.
   The emergency feed programs will now be available in all the
remaining designated counties at the discretion of county
committees.

<NOTE>EDs: Reworks throughout to include Meese's comment that he will

<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III said Thursday
he wants to be reimbursed for his legal fees from the independent
counsel's investigation and acknowledged that he would have handled
the Wedtech Corp. matter differently if he had known ``that this
was a gang of crooks.''
   ``Obviously, ... if you had total knowledge of what was going to
be revealed later ... then there might be things you do
differently,'' Meese said in an interview with reporters.
   ``For example, in the Wedtech matter, which was handled like I
would any other ..., if I had known or anybody had known ... that
this was a gang of crooks, there would have been quite different
handling of the situation, obviously. But nobody did know that,''
said Meese, who announced Tuesday he will leave government in late
July or early August.
   His reference to ``crooks'' apparently was directed at four
former Wedtech executives who pleaded guilty to criminal charges
and are cooperating in the government's prosecution of Rep. Mario
Biaggi, D-N.Y., and other politicians and businessmen in the
Wedtech scandal.
   On the matter of his legal fees, Meese confirmed that he would
seek reimbursement from the taxpayers for his expenses in defending
himself during the investigation by independent counsel James
McKay. The independent counsel submitted his report on the
investigation on Tuesday. Although the contents of the report have
not been not been made public, Meese has said he was vindicated
because McKay did not seek an indictment.
   On his 1987 financial disclosure form issued this week, Meese
estimated his legal fees for the first 7{ months of the
investigation at $100,000 to $250,000.
   The Ethics in Government Act, under which the investigation of
Meese was conducted, provides for reimbursement of fees incurred by
public officials who aren't indicted. Meese will apply for payment
of the fees to the three-member federal appeals court panel that
appointed McKay.
   Also during the interview with reporters, Meese insisted that he
has lived up to the promise he made 3{ years ago to the Senate
Judiciary Committee that he would avoid the appearance of a
conflict of interest or even a situation in which someone might
unfairly interpret something as a conflict of interest.
   ``I've adhered to that standard throughout,'' Meese said.
   He added that ``obviously there have been things that ... I
didn't know about'' at the time, but said that based on
``everything I knew at the time, I've upheld that standard
throughout the time that I've been in office.''
   As White House counselor in 1981, Meese, at the behest of
longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, interceded on behalf of the
South Bronx, N.Y., defense contractor. Meese has acknowledged
directing his staff to ensure that the firm got a fair hearing from
the Army in the company's effort to win a $32 million no-bid
engine-building contract.
   Wedtech ended up getting the job and Meese's involvement with
the company has been a major focus of the just-completed 14-month
criminal investigation of his activities.
   Meese said in the interview that ``I did handle many other
similar matters in the White House when there were complaints made
or concerns expressed about the treatment being afforded by
government departments.''
   While Meese won't be indicted, he could face an examination of
his ethics by the Justice Department's Office of Professional
Responsibility or the Office of Government Ethics.
   Wallach is under indictment for alleged racketeering in the
Wedtech scandal, and his close relationship with Meese formed the
basis for McKay's criminal investigation of the attorney general.
   Meese said earlier this year that he still regarded Wallach as
his friend, but subsequently has declined to answer any questions
in regard to Wallach, who has yet to come to trial on the
indictment.

<HEAD>Official: Mother's Funeral May Bring Panama President Out of
Hiding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The funeral of the ousted Panamanian president's
mother in that Central American nation could bring the former
leader out of hiding, a consular official said Thursday.
   Eric Arturo Delvalle, recognized by the United States as
Panama's leader, has not been seen in public since Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega replaced him in February with the current acting
civilian chief of state, Manuel Solis Palma.
   The body of Delvalle's mother, Abigail Henriquez de Delvalle,
71, was to be flown to Panama on Thursday evening. She died at
Mercy Hospital here Wednesday of a heart attack, a week after
flying to Miami for heart surgery, said Roberto Dominguez, Panama's
consul here.
   Her funeral was set Friday, and Solis Palma has said Delvalle
and his family can attend the service without fear of reprisal,
said Dominguez.
   ``I understand from family members that Delvalle may attend the
funeral, but I have not spoken to him directly,'' he said.
   ``But it could be a trap,'' added Dominguez, who opposes
Noriega, the country's military leader.
   The funeral could be a problem for the United States, which must
decide whether it should protect Delvalle, he said.
   In Washington, Panama's anti-Noriega ambassador, Juan Sosa, said
Thursday the funeral will be private. He did not not know if
Delvalle planned to come out of hiding for the service.
   He said he has not received ``communications from the
illegitimate government'' of Panama about arrangements for
Delvalle's safety.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Ben Justesen in Washington said
his office had no information on whether Delvalle or anyone from
the U.S. embassy there would attend.
   The U.S. Embassy in Panama refused comment on whether its
officials would attend the funeral, and said they did not know
Delvalle's plans.
   Delvalle was replaced by Noriega after he tried to fire him as
head of the armed forces in the wake of the general's indictment in
Florida on drug charges.
   The ouster was never recognized by the United States government,
which cut off funds to Panama in an unsuccessful effort to remove
Noriega. The Reagan administration later offered to drop the
indictments in return for Noriega's departure, but the deal fell
through.

<HEAD>First Death of Demonstrator Reported in Ethnic Turmoil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first death of a demonstrator in a monthslong
ethnic dispute was reported Thursday in the southern republic of
Armenia, whose residents continued a strike that has devastated the
area's economy.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said a resident of the
Armenian capital of Yerevan, Kh. Zakharyan, was seriously wounded
on a highway Tuesday and died later in a hospital. It said a
criminal investiation had begun.
   Izvestia reported that a ``major part'' of Armenia's industry,
construction and transportation remained idle Thursday.
   The Armenian press agency said Zakharyan was hit by a plastic
bullet fired by Soviet forces shortly after thousands of
demonstrators mobbed Yerevan's international airport on Tuesday to
demand that aviation workers join the strike.
   Government spokesmen in Moscow denied on Wednesday that anyone
had died in the latest round of protests by Armenians seeking
annexation of the nearby region of Nagorno-Karabakh, now part of
the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   The report Thursday was the first of Soviet forces using guns
against demonstrators since the peaceful protests in Yerevan began
in February. It was also the first indication that troops
patrolling the area are armed with rounds designed to be non-lethal.
   An editor at Armenia's official news agency said troops were
called to Zvartnots Airport to break up the demonstration, which
disrupted flights. The soldiers were withdrawn Thursday and flights
resumed, said the editor, speaking on condition of anomymity.
   A Soviet television newscast Thursday night showed crowds of
people who had been waiting for days at the airport for flights out
of Yerevan.
   ``What I saw is practically impossible to describe in words,'' a
witness of Tuesday's airport demonstration said in a broadcast
interview. ``In my opinion, innocent passengers suffered.''
   The TV report showed soldiers wearing helmets and carrying guns
patrolling roads leading to the airport. It was not clear when the
pictures were taken.
   The labor newspaper Trud said Thursday that the airport
disturbance forced cancellation of 60 flights Monday and Tuesday
and disrupted the travel of 14,000 passengers.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfilyev told a news
conference Wednesday that troops routed about 2,000 people from the
immediate airport area. He said 36 people ``had to seek medical
assistance'' after the clash late Tuesday.
   S. Petrosyan, a member of Armenia's Politburo, went on
television Wednesday evening to call on Armenians to resume work
and ``be reasonable,'' Trud said. It quoted the Ministry of
Internal Affairs as saying the situation in Yerevan remains serious.
   Ethnic Armenians make up the majority in Nagorno-Karabakh. They
have long been demanding that the mountainous region be transfered
to Armenia.
   Armenia supports the demand, but Azerbaijan rejects it and the
issue has gone to officials in Moscow.
   In February, rioting in the Azerbaijani city of Sumgait left
dead 32 people _ 26 Armenians and six Azerbaijanis.
   Newspapers reported Tuesday that a general strike had begun in
Yerevan, apparently over dissatisfaction with a national Communist
Party conference in Moscow that failed to resolve the
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute.

   The Navy would be ordered to name ``an

   The measure provides that the ship would be named after Hope in
recognition of his efforts over 50 years _ and three wars _ to
entertain U.S. military personnel overseas.
   The bill did not say what type of ship will carry Hope's name.

<HEAD>Teachers Union Adopts Sympathy Resolution Over Iran Jet</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Teachers-Notebook Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Education Association delegates
concluded their annual meeting Thursday by adopting a watered-down
resolution extending condolences to the families of the 290 victims
of the downed Iranian jet.
   After a long debate, the 8,227 delegates voted to delete
language that would have implicitly criticized the U.S. action in
the Persian Gulf.
   The final wording approved by the teacher delegates extended
``our sincere condolences to the families of victims. The
Representative Assembly urges all parties to seek an immediate
solution to the conflict.''
   The 1.9 million-member union has been a frequent critic of
Reagan administration foreign policies.
   In other actions, delegates approved a resolution that would
restrict home schooling and force anyone teaching a child at home
to meet state requirements.
   They also urged public schools to teach children about the
influence of religious heritage in the nation and the world.
   The union also passed a measure urging athletic organizations,
sports media outlets and others ``to join in efforts to change the
term, `man-to-man' defense'' to ``one-to-one'' defense in reference
to women's and girls' basketball.
   Finally, the teacher union called on its members to refrain from
participating in mass released balloon launches, especially those
made of latex, because they have ``a deleterious impact on our
environment.''
   A national balloon launch sponsored each spring by a science
teachers' organization has come under criticism from
environmentalists, who say porpoises and other marine life have
been harmed by ingesting the ballooms. The science teachers are
looking for safer balloons.

<HEAD>Ann Landers Breaks Own Rule to Fulfill Vietnam Vet's Dream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advice columnist Ann Landers says she broke her
rule against helping readers contact each other to help a Vietnam
veteran get in touch with the mother of a buddy killed in the war.
   After trying unsuccessfully to locate the man's family, Ms.
Landers decided to publish a letter from veteran Gil Noble, who
wrote that he wanted Kevin H. Dugan's parents to know ``how much
their son was admired and respected by the men he served with.''
   She said she telephoned several Dugans in Kevin's hometown of
Blue Point, N.Y., but no one knew him.
   Finally, Ms. Landers said she decided to break her rule and
publish Noble's name with his letter Tuesday, in hopes that a
reader of her nationally syndicated column would know Kevin's
family.
   It turned out well, but there's a risk, she noted.
   ``You never really know who these people are. Sometimes these
people who write the most charming and warm letters can be the
kookiest,'' Ms. Landers said Thursday, explaining her rule of not
putting people in touch with each other. ``But I felt the letter
from Gil Noble was so sincere. I felt, well, here's an opportunity
to make a whole family happy.''
   Kevin's mother, Anne Dugan Brown, still lives in Blue Point,
N.Y. But she remarried after her son's death in 1968 and said she
might never have heard from Noble without Ms. Landers' help.
   A neighbor called early Tuesday to tell her about the column,
she said, and the phone then rang all day.
   Noble, a 44-year-old business teacher in Vista, Calif., also
talked to Ms. Brown on Tuesday after Kevin's brother passed on her
telephone number.
   ``We were all a little teary-eyed at first,'' Ms. Brown said,
``but I felt it was a wonderful tribute to (Kevin's) memory.''

<HEAD>US Regrets Panamanian Boycott of Canal Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Panamanian decision to boycott a scheduled
meeting of the board that oversees operations of the Panama Canal
is ``regrettable and irresponsible,'' the State Department said
Thursday.
   The decision was also denounced by William R. Gianelli, board
chairman of the Panama Canal Commission. He accused Panama of a
``total disregard for the efficient and safe operation of the
Panama Canal.''
   The commission's next meeting is set for next week in Savannah,
Ga., but Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said Tuesday that
Panamanian representatives will not attend that or any future
meeting.
   That policy, Ritter said, will remain in place until ``the
United States normalizes relations with Panama'' and recognizes
nominees appointed by the government that replaced the one headed
by President Eric Arturo Delvalle last February.
   The Reagan administration has continued to recognize Delvalle as
the legitimate authority in Panama. It also has called on Panama's
de facto ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, to resign and to leave
the country. Noriega is under federal indictment on drug-smuggling
charges.
   The Panama Canal treaty established the canal commission,
mandating that it consist of five U.S. and four Panamanian members.
   Gianelli said Panama's boycott of the commission meeting
``impacts on training Panamanians for higher positions with the
canal commission and will undoubtedly slow the process of moving
those outstanding Panamanian employees into more responsible and
senior positions.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson announced plans Thursday to lead a
three-day ``Jackson Action Rainbow Express'' bus trip from Chicago
to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta.
   Jackson said his presidential campaign also will sponsor
workshops for people outside the convention hall. He said the
emphasis on non-delegates is intended to strengthen the party, not
steal thunder from the expected Democratic presidential nominee,
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   Jackson was in Atlanta Thursday to review his convention plans
and to join local civil rights leaders in work on his political
action committee, the Keep Hope Alive PAC.
   ``We will be raising money to put the focus on areas where there
is need to finance candidates running for various offices to keep
building our progressive coalition of farmers and workers and men
and women,'' he said at a news conference.
   Jackson said he is not organizing a large-scale pilgrimage of
his supporters to Atlanta for the July 18-21 convention, but said,
``thousands of people always come.''
   He said the bus ride, probably starting July 14 in Chicago, will
allow him to thank his supporters and encourage voter registration
for the general election.
   ``We just decided to come by bus rather than by Airbus. We don't
want a ship to mistake us,'' he said. Jackson earlier had said that
Sunday's downing of an Iranian Airbus passenger plane by a U.S.
warship showed American foreign policy should be based more on
diplomacy than sophisticated weapons.
   Jackson would not comment on whether his enthusiasm for the
general election might diminish if he were not asked to be the vice
presidential nominee, but he suggested he will be influenced by the
treatment his candidacy and platform proposals receive from the
convention and Dukakis.
   ``The conclusion of those steps will in some measure determine
what our fall activities will be,'' he said.

   The Democratic Platform Committee will issue
its streamlined party platform early next week, a party official
said Thursday.
   Although the party's platform writers approved a roughly
3,500-word draft platform in Denver June 25, they have not yet
completed the task of polishing the amendments approved at that
meeting.
   The Michael Dukakis campaign is still negotiating with Jesse
Jackson's forces over the civil rights leader's plan to pursue as
many as 13 minority plants at the party's convention in Atlanta
July 19.
   The Jackson campaign was rebuffed at the Denver meeting on such
issues as Jackson's call for higher taxes on the wealthy, a
Pentagon freeze, a U.S. promise of no-first-use of nuclear weapons,
and self-determination for the Palestinians.
   Mike Barnes, a former Maryland congressman handling the platform
for the Dukakis campaign, said, ``We are continuing to work with
the committee members and the other campaign trying to resolve
outstanding issues.''
   He said ``purely mechanical'' reasons had delayed issuing the
amended majority report. ``People were hard to reach during the
holiday weekend,'' Barnes explained.
   A platform committee official, who asked not to be identified,
said the entire report, including the Jackson minority planks, may
be released Monday.
   The convention starts July 18 in Atlanta, with the delegates
scheduled to take up the platform the next day.
   Jackson controlled more than a quarter of the 186-member
platform committee, enough to ensure that he can carry any issue he
wishes to the floor.

aftermath of last Sunday's destruction of an Iranian jetliner by
the USS Vincennes:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PENTAGON BRIEFING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon spokesman said it was extremely unlikely that a
second Iranian airplane was near Iran Air Flight 655 when it was
shot down. It has been suggested that a second plane, emitting a
military identification signal, might have prompted the Vincennes
captain to fire on the civilian airliner.
   The Pentagon backed off from its earlier assertion that the
Iranian airliner was flying outside the commercial air corridor.
   Pentagon spokesman Daniel Howard also said that Iran should
share responsibility for the downing of the plane because it took
off from a joint military and civilian airfield during an exchange
of fire between the Vincennes and Iranian gunboats and was headed
straight at the Vincennes.

   In Tehran, tens of thousands of Iranians shouting ``Death to

   President Ali Khamenei, Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
and Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, the designated successor of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, led the procession with 76 coffins
draped with Iranian flags.
   The mass funeral started with a fiery speech from Khamenei, who
mocked American statements on the incident and called for revenge.

   The manager of the airport in Bandar Abbas, where Flight 655
originated, said the Navy failed to use the proper frequency when
it warned the Iran Air flight away from the Vincennes.
   Hossein Peroussi, who said he was in the control tower Sunday,
denied Pentagon claims the Vincennes sent warnings to the plane on
both ultra-high frequency and very-high frequency radio channels.
He said the Navy uses only UHF channels and the Airbus received
only VHF signals.
   Peroussi also said transponders on the plane emitted signals
``only in a civilian mode, not a military mode.'' The Pentagon said
the Vincennes received both types of signals from the plane.

hostage Edward Austin Tracy's U.S. passport.

<HEAD>COMPENSATION</HEAD>

   ``Humane and moral'' considerations will figure heavily in the
decision on compensation to the families of victims of the Iranian
airliner tragedy, President Reagan's chief spokesman said.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater emphasized that the compensation
matter is under staff review and has not yet even gone to senior
advisers or the president.

<HEAD>CONGRESSIONAL COMMENTARY</HEAD>

   Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd said U.S. ships in the
Persian Gulf are ``in an untenable position'' and President
Reagan's policy in the region needs to be reassessed.
   House Speaker Jim Wright called the incident ``a very
straightforward error of misidentification'' but said the Iranian
government ``must assume some serious responsibility for this kind
of an error'' because of the attacks by its gunboats on the
Vincennes just before the A-300 Airbus was shot down.

   CIA Director William Webster said the United States was prepared
for Iranian reprisals. ``Our government has procedures in place to
protect our citizens and our officials who would be likely targets.

   America's international airlines say they have taken additional
precautions against terrorism since the incident. Bob Kierce, TWA's
director of international security, said the airline has taken
steps to ensure that security procedures ``are being exercised to

<HEAD>Former Czech Leader Calls on Current Leaders to Follow Soviet
Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, whose liberal
Czechoslovak ``Prague spring'' was ended by a Soviet invasion in
August 1968, urged his country's current leaders Thursday to adopt
new Kremlin-style reforms.
   In a television interview said to be the first with a Western
network since his ouster as Communist Party chief, Dubcek called
the invasion ``a heavy moral burden on our society.''
   Dubcek, 66, lost his party post in April 1969 and was expelled
from the party in June 1970.
   Many economic and social reforms supported by Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev are similar to those Dubcek introduced 20
years ago.
   He now lives as a pensioner in virtual seclusion. Austrian
television interviewed him as he worked in his garden at
Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia about 40 miles east of Vienna,
dressed in an undershirt and shorts.
   ``I welcome every positive step which is made for the
application of Soviet restructuring under our conditions,'' the
former party chief said. ``Some people say we cannot use all that,
but in the last 20 years the same people have copied everying (from
the Soviet Union).''
   When the late Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev was in power,
``we had to march the way Brezhnev ordered,'' Dubcek said.
   ``Now the same people (Czech leaders) are very selective when it
comes to deciding what suits Czechoslovakia and what not,'' he
said. ``There is a certain inconsistency in evaluating the
experience. I believe that what happens in the Soviet Union now is
well suited for our conditions.''
   Dubcek deplored the fact that Kremlin reform ``unfortunately
comes after 20 years.'' In those years, he said, ``the existing
backwardness has deepened, and that testifies to the fact that the
invasion was not right.''
   Asked for comment on the recent Communist Party conference in
Moscow, Dubcek said: ``I was always firmly convinced that ...
Gorbachev's leadership will prevail. The conference has confirmed
that and I am happy about it.''
   Dubcek chided Western officials, who he said believe it is a
good thing ``if socialism ares badly.''
   On the contrary, he said, ``it is better for Western democracies
if the Soviet leadership finally and radically distances itself
from Stalinist militarism and departs from Brezhnev's dogmatism.''

   A House Judiciary subcommittee recommended
unanimously Thursday that the House impeach U.S. District Judge
Alcee L. Hastings for committing ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
   The House criminal justice subcommittee voted 7-0 to send the
resolution of 17 articles of impeachment to the House Judiciary
Committee for further action. The full committee is expected to act
next Thursday.
   The resolution charges three main impeachable offenses: that
Hastings conspired with a Washington attorney to receive a bribe in
exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers,
that he lied during his trial and that he compromised an FBI
wiretap by leaking information from it to a target.
   ``It ain't over. It's far from over,'' Hastings said at the U.S.
District Courthouse in Miami where he had been participating in a
trial.
   Hastings, Florida's first black federal judge and a fiery orator
popular on the lecture circuit, was unusually terse. He refused to
appear on local television newscasts.
   Saying he is ``legally, morally and spiritually correct,''
Hastings called the proceedings politically motivated and said the
panel decision shows they ``do not respect the jury system.''
   Hastings said he would continue to hear cases because there is
no reason why he would have to step down.
   Terence J. Anderson, Hastings' lawyer, said he believes the
resolution will go to the House floor for a vote as soon as
possible.
   If the full House impeaches Hastings, the Senate would conduct a
trial to determine whether he should be removed from office.
   ``I was pessimistic, but I was surprised by the unanimity,''
said Anderson.
   ``I take it in good faith that they believe it was an
impeachable offense,'' Anderson said. ``It's now time to prepare
for a trial in the Senate.''
   Hastings has insisted he is innocent of any wrongdoing.
   The seven members voting for the resolution were Chairman John
Conyers, D-Mich.; Don Edwards, D-Calif.; Mike Synar, D-Okla.; Rick
Boucher, D-Va.; John Bryant, D-Texas; George W. Gekas, R-Pa.; and
Hamilton Fish Jr., R-N.Y. Patrick L. Swindall, R-Ga., did not
attend the session.
   Conyers, who like Hastings is black, said the decision was the
hardest he has had to make during his years in Congress.
   Reciting his civil rights record, including opposition to
Southern judges who discriminate against blacks, Conyers said, ``We
did not fight that civil rights struggle to replace one
discrimination with another. We cannot set up a double standard. We
must demand that everyone live up to high standards.
   ``We are not here to discuss guilt or innocence, but whether
there have been high crimes and misdemeanors and pass them onto the
full House. We have done that,'' Conyers said.
   Gekas said the resolution contains offenses ``that were
substantiated fully in the hearings.''
   Fish said the hearings showed that Hastings ``sought to sell his
office for private gain and then lied about it under oath.'' He
also said the leaking of the wiretap information ``cannot be
tolerated.''
   ``The evidence in this matter is overwhelming,'' said Synar.
``There is no doubt that Judge Hastings committed these act for
which he is charged.''
   In February 1983, Hastings was acquitted of charges he conspired
with Washington lawyer William Borders to receive a bribe in
exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers.
Borders was convicted in a separate trial, was sent to prison and
has been released.
   A month after Hastings' 1983 acquittal, U.S. District Judges W.
Terrell Hodges of Florida and Anthony A. Alaimo of Georgia filed a
complaint under the 1980 discipline law asking the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Florida, to investigate
Hastings.
   After a lengthy inquiry, made longer by Hastings' challenge to
the law's constitutionality, a five-member panel of the 11th
Circuit recommended that the House begin the impeachment inquiry.
   The main charges against Hastings before the House criminal
justice subcommittee were that Hastings conspired with Borders to
take a bribe, that he had fabricated his defense to secure the
acquittal at his criminal trial and that he had compromised three
investigations by leaking the fact that the FBI hada wiretap in the
cases.

   Eight Marines remained in a hospital
Thursday with injuries received in a mortar shell explosion that
killed two others, a Marine spokesman said.
   All eight were in stable condition with shrapnel wounds, said
Maj. Kerry K. Gershaneck, the public affairs officer at the Kaneohe
Marine Corps Air Station on the island of Oahu.
   Seven others who were injured in the Wednesday night accident
were released after treatment, he said.
   The names of the dead and injured were withheld, pending
notification of families.
   The injuries occurred when mortar rounds accidentally landed and
exploded among a platoon of about 30 Marines during exercises at
the Pohakuloa Training Area, Gershaneck said.
   Marine investigators will try to determine what caused the
shells to land among the Marines, Gershaneck said.
   Pohakuloa is an isolated military training ground located at the
7,000-foot elevation on the southwest flank of the 13,796-foot
Mauna Kea, Hawaii's tallest mountain.

<HEAD>Composer's Remains Laid to Final Rest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mortal remains of Hungarian-born
composer Bela Bartok were laid to final rest Thursday in the family
tomb on a Budapest hillside, 43 years after he died of leukemia in
New York.
   At least 5,000 Hungarians thronged the small Farkasret Cemetery
for the reburial, including Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi and
pianist Annie Fischer.
   Bartok, one of the leading composers of the 20th century, was
born in 1881 in Transylvania. He left Hungary in 1940 in disgust
over its close ties with Nazi Germany and emigrated to the United
States, where he died five years later.
   ``This is a welcome home and a last farewell rolled into one
solemn ceremony,'' Jozsef Ujfalussy, former director of the Franz
Liszt Academy of Music, told the mourners. ``His music created a
new world that extended mankind's artistic horizons and tends to
universality.''
   ``He set a great human example for man's search for freedom and
humanity, and his remains now return to a nation in quest of a
newly found self-awareness,'' said Ujfalussy, author of several
monographs on Bartok.
   As part of a Unitarian burial ceremony, Bishop Joszef Ferencz
delivered a funeral oration extolling Bartok's human qualities and
moral standing.
   A monument of Swedish black granite, the work of scupltor Miklos
Borsos, marked the burial place. Borsos said it symbolizes ``an
apotheosis of music, the soul as a taking-off bird.''
   Bartok was reburied next to his two wives, his mother and an
aunt, and near his greatest friend and collaborator, Zoltan Kodaly.
   The remains were exhumed at New York's Ferncliff cemetery June
21. A brass plaque that marked Bartok's grave there was buried with
him at Farkasret.
   The ceremony was broadcast live by this Communist-ruled nation's
state radio and television.
   Peter Bartok, 64, who lives in Homosassa, Fla., and Bela Bartok
Jr., 78, accompanied their father's remains from New York on the
liner Queen Elizabeth II and then through France, West Germany and
Austria. The elder son lives in Budapest and is president of
Hungary's Unitarian Church.
   A religious choir sang the hymn ``We Have Placed Our Faith In
The Lord'' at the funeral service Thursday, then Ferencz, spiritual
leader of Hungary's 10,000 Unitarians, praised Bartok for adopting
the faith in 1916.
   ``This faith is humane tolerance itself, very much an embodiment
of what he stood for as a musician and a man,'' he said.
   Vice President Rezsoe Trautmann spoke after the Unitarian
service. He criticized some of the ``dogmatic'' events of the early
1950s, when Bartok's music was oficially frowned upon as
``formalist'' and effectively disappeared from concert programs.
   ``The return of his remains now is a great solace for the nation
as a whole,'' Trautmann said.
   At least 10,000 Hungarians and hundreds of foreign visitors
Wednesday paid their last respects to Bartok's remains at the
Academy of Sciences building.

<HEAD>International Competitors Float Over Desert in Israel's First
Balloon Race</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 40 balloonists from 15 countries
floated over the Negev Desert Thursday in Israel's first
international balloon race, with U.S. participants saying the
weather was perfect for the three-day adventure.
   Balloonists, including 20 from the United States, came to Israel
for the three-day International Hot Air Balloon Goodwill Fiesta,
organized as part of a festival in the Negev Desert highlighting
Israel's 40th anniversary celebrations.
   Ron Bush, 48, of Lubbock, Texas, said the unpredictable desert
winds forced him to make an unscheduled stop in a Bedouin village.
   ``We found that the winds were taking us quite a way from the
main road into this village,'' he said. ``We were curious, so we
made a low-level flight, about six feet off the ground, right
through the village.
   ``When we landed at the edge of the village, the boys and the
men came out to greet us,'' Bush said. ``They were very excited.
These people have never seen such a thing,'' he said.
   The children shouted ``Ahlan Wahsahlan,'' Arabic for welcome,
when the balloon touched down on Wednesday, the first part of the
race, the daily Jerusalem Post said.
   Some of the American competitors said quickly shifting desert
winds provided conditions that were just right for ballooning.
   ``It's great for balloonists,'' said Bush. ``You can pick a
current that can take you this way or that way. At home, the winds
usually blow in the same direction.''
   Paul Smith, 32, a lawyer from Albuquerque, N.M., agreed. ``The
wind speed is less than five knots on the ground for a nice easy
takeoff, and a little faster when you get up,'' Smith said.
   Bill Arras of Redmond, Ore., took the lead Wednesday. Thursday's
results were not immediately available.
   Smith said that when he landed at the end of the race Wednesday,
he came down next to some camels, ``but they just walked away from
us.''
   Participants are ranked according to how close they come to a
target, but speed is not essential, Smith said in a telephone
interview.
   He said the 70-foot-tall balloons can reach an altitude of
50,000 feet, although in the current race most floated at about
2,000 feet.
   Balloonists can only adjust the altitude of their crafts. They
navigate horizontally by latching on to wind currents taking them
in the right direction.
   The take-off field near Tel Arad, about 35 miles south of
Jerusalem, was heavily guarded by Israeli troops.
   One soldier noted the duty was ``a nice change from the West
Bank,'' referring to previous tours of duty in Israel's turbulent
occupied territories.

<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel told
Congress on Thursday that a White House agency he heads isn't doing
the job and ought to die a natural death.
   The agency is the three-member National Critical Materials
Council, of which Hodel is chairman. The council was established in
the Executive Office of the President by Congress in 1984 to report
within a year on inventories and prospects for certain important
materials.
   Among other things, the council was supposed to coordinate
materials research by government agencies.
   That couldn't be done, Hodel said in testifying before the House
Science subcommittee on transportation, aviation and materials. ``I
have gradually and reluctantly come to the conclusion that this is
not a workable model,'' he said, and advised the subcommittee that
the legislation establishing the council be allowed to lapse
without renewal in 1990.
   ``It is extremely difficult for a three-person council ... to
move in and take a look at the very heart of mission-related
departmental programs and tell the department managers how they
ought to restructure or structure their research programs. There is
considerable resistance to doing that,'' said Hodel.
   Robert Dale Wilson, until a month ago executive director of the
council, blamed the Office of Management and Budget for delaying
the council's first report, a report Hodel said was now at the
printer.
   ``OMB directed me to delete or substantially rewrite all of
these (four) factual chapters, because, and I quote, `Giving these
facts to Congress would be like throwing raw meat to dogs,'''
Wilson said in written testimony.
   He did not indicate the specific facts in question, but said the
chapters dealt with ``the administration's notoriously flawed
proposal to sell 96 percent of the national defense stockpile, a
discussion of our recently increased dependence on the Soviet bloc
for metals, the importance of South African minerals and the
inequitable and noncompetitive impact of U.S. involvement in
funding international financial institutions ... which directly
subsidize competitors of the U.S. mining industry.''
   Wilson said the American mining industry should be helped by the
government, the council should be retained with a larger budget and
OMB's powers should be reduced: ``I have seen it override decisions
made by cabinet secretaries who opposed it. ... OMB does not want
(the council) to survive or to issue its reports in any fashion
that might be helpful to the public interest. Quite frankly, I do
not know who is served by their actions.''
   Answering questions from the subcommittee chairman, Rep. Dave
McGurdy, D-Okla., Hodel said a single administrator ``would be
stronger'' than a multimember body.
   But the council's job, he said, might better be handled by the
president's science adviser, because that adviser has experience
roaming through different departments, access to the president and,
just as important, access to the Office of Management and Budget.

   The Piper Alpha platform destroyed in
the worst offshore oil rig disaster was an assembly of flat-roofed
structures and steel towers that rose 150 above the water.
   It was 215 feet long and 100 feet wide, among the largest of the
123 fixed platforms that dot the British sector of the North Sea
oil field. A fire burned constantly at its top, flaming off excess
gas.
   The $901 million Piper Alpha, owned by Occidental Petroleum,
began pumping oil and gas in December 1976 from its location 120
miles off eastern Scotland and was among the oldest of the North
Sea rigs.
   Last year, the 34,000-ton platform produced a daily average of
23 million cubic feet of gas and 167,200 barrels of oil.
   It was linked to four other platforms in one of the most
profitable sectors of the North Sea field discovered in the 1960s.
   More than 200 men worked the Piper Alpha, earning up to $1,000 a
week in dangerous jobs. They lived on the platform for up to two
weeks at a time, on a duty schedule of 12 hours on and 12 off.
   The Piper Alpha was pinned to the sea bed and supported by steel
stilts, with most of its 649-foot height submerged. It included a
helicopter landing pad used to ferry the workers out from Aberdeen,
and had lifeboats with a total capacity of 300 people.

<HEAD>Wright Wary of Compensation Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, said
Thursday he does not necessarily endorse proposals to pay
compensation to the families of Iranians killed in the U.S.
destruction of a commercial jetliner over the Persian Gulf.
   Wright, whose district office in Fort Worth has been flooded
with angry calls over the issue, said he had been misquoted Tuesday
when questioned during a trip to London about whether the United
States should offer compensation.
   ``At no time did I say anything that would lend itself to the
interpretation that I was endorsing the idea,'' Wright told
reporters in his first news conference since returning from the
weekend trip.
   Rather, Wright said, any decision on such payments should come
from President Reagan. If the president decides to offer
compensation, Congress would likely support it, he said.
   In a national ABC News-Washington Post poll following the
incident, 61 percent of those surveyed said they did not favor
payment of compensation.
   In London on Tuesday, Wright was asked whether the United States
should offer monetary compensation for the 290 lives lost.
   He responded that it was difficult to equate money with lost
lives, but added: ``Yes, if that would assuage the grief of the
other aggrieved party, surely we could do that ... Congress would
support that if it were requested.''
   Wright also called the incident ``a very straightforward error
of misidentification.'' He told of a time during his service as a
bombardier in World War II when what he had thought were U.S. P-38
fighters began to fire on his aircraft. ``It's a human error,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Air New Zealand Crew Error Responsible for 1979 Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1979 crash of an Air New Zealand DC-10
into a mountain in Antarctica was the result of crew error and not
any fault of Navy air traffic controllers, a judge ruled Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene blamed the airline and the
crew of Flight 901 for a series of mistakes that caused the plane
to fly off course into Mt. Erebus, killing all 257 people on board.
   Greene dismissed $32 million in negligence claims against the
U.S. government by relatives and heirs of 16 of the 20 crew members
who died in the Nov. 28. 1979 crash on Ross Island in Antarctica.
   The judge blamed the airline for changing the original flight
plan for the sightseeing trip without briefing the crew. He also
cited the crew's failure to use the airliner's internal navigation
device and a weather radar system to determine its location.
   ``Were it not for the tragic outcome, the planning phase of
Flight 901 could be described as a comedy of errors; some of these
errors were perpetrated by Air New Zealand, others by members of
the flight crew,'' Greene said.
   The change in the flight plan put the plane directly in a course
over Mt. Erebus instead of down the center of McMurdo Sound. The
plan called for Flight 901 to avoid the mountain by flying at an
altitude of 16,000 feet.
   To give passengers a better view of Ross Island, the plane
descended without radar assistance to less than 2,000 feet in
violation of Air New Zealand policy, Greene said.
   It was flying at an altitude of 1,500 feet when it crashed into
Mt. Erebus.
   The crew never discovered the change because it never bothered
to plot the coordinates of the new flight plan, Greene said. Nor
did crew members bother to use the plane's internal navigation
system to determine its geographical location.
   ``Had a single crew member performed this simple task at any
time during the last hour of flight, he would have learned that the
aircraft was not on longitude 165 degrees heading down the open
sound, but on a longitude of 167 degrees heading toward Mt.
Erebus.''
   If the crew were more alert, it would have noticed that Beaufort
Island was to the plane's right instead of the left _ as it would
have been if Flight 901 had flown on the original course, Greene
said.
   ``The air traffic controllers at McMurdo Station had no reason
to suspect that these errors in the most fundamental principles of
planning and airmanship had occurred, and that they had profoundly
altered what would otherwise have been a safe and uneventful
flight,'' Greene said.
   ``Absent such knowledge, they had no basis for suspecting that
Flight 901 was in mortal peril, or for taking extraordinary
measures that even the flight crew never requested them to take,''
Greene said.
   The Navy's air traffic controllers are assigned to McMurdo
Station to help direct aircraft used in scientific exploration by
the National Science Foundation and other organizations.

   Roy Carey, a survivor of the world's
worst offshore oil platform disaster, said Thursday: ``We had all
that water around us and no way to get it to us. We had sprinklers
but they weren't strong enough.''
   Carey's remark as he lay badly burned in a hospital bed in
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary pointed up a bitter irony of offshore
oil-drilling, one of the world's most dangerous occupations.
   The presumed death toll from the explosion and fire Wednesday
night on the Piper Alpha platform in the North Sea exceeded 160.
   Urgent questions about safety in the offshore oil and gas
industry are being raised by the disaster, which brings to more
than 300 the number of people who have died in the British sector
of the North Sea since gas was first pumped ashore in 1967.
   Drilling accidents killed 76 and a helicopter crash killed 45.
Last year, six workers were killed and 59 seriously hurt among the
28,000 British workers.
   Three workers from Piper Alpha died after being thrown into the
sea when a gangway collapsed in 1982. In 1984, a non-fatal
explosion and fire forced the evacuation of 174 men.
   The platform, which has been producing oil since December 1976,
passed its latest annual safety inspection by the Energy Department
less than two weeks ago.
   Smoking and drinking are forbidden on oil platforms and a rescue
vessel stands by each rig at all times.
   John Brading, a London-based executive of Occidental Petroleum,
which operates the platform, said workmen had been installing a
vertical pipe linked to a seabed pipeline that runs to a new oil
field.
   The platform draws mixed oil and gas from under the seabed,
separates them and sends them ashore through separate pipelines.
   When a reporter asked if sparks from an oxyacetylene burner
could have ignited gas supplies passing through the platform,
Brading replied: ``It is much too early to draw any conclusions.''
   A company statement said the fire's cause appeared to be a gas
leak. Derek Ellington, one of the survivors, said he heard a
shrieking sound just before the explosion and believed it was gas
escaping from the separation system.
   In Parliament, lawmaker John Prescott of the opposition Labor
Party claimed inspection and maintenance of rigs had been reduced
in recent years, insufficient money was spent on training, and
government health and safety legislation did not apply fully to the
North Sea oil and gas industry.
   Energy Secretary Cecil Parkinson replied that serious North Sea
accidents had declined from 101 in 1986 to 59 last year. ``But that
is too high a figure and we wish to keep the pressure on to ensure
that improvement is maintained.''
   Labor unions have complained in the past about the quality and
avilability of survival gear and too few rescue helicopters. They
see a conflict of interest in making the Energy Department
responsible for oil production as well as safety.

   Men jumped from the blazing oil
platform or slithered down searing pipes as the heat popped windows
like bubbles, but most had no chance and comrades could only watch
helplessly from a nearby vessel.
   ``It was a case of fry and die or jump and try,'' said technican
Roy Carey, 45, who leaped into the cold North Sea to escape the
flames that engulfed the giant Piper Alpha rig after an explosion
Wednesday night.
   His face was burned and his arms were in slings. ``I was
smothered with smoke. I could hardly see and couldn't breathe, so
it was over the side or die there,'' he said from his hospital bed
in Aberdeen.
   Carey said one of the rig's survival boats floated past him and
three other men.
   They grabbed at it and a man aboard held out his hands, ``but I
couldn't get a foothold. The waves were hitting me in my chest. I
didn't want to drag him off so I just stayed in the water.''
Another boat picked him up half an hour later.
   ``We had all that water around us and no way to get it to us,''
to fight the fire, Carey said. ``We had sprinklers but they weren't
strong enough.''
   James McDonald, a 50-year-old rigger, told the Aberdeen Evening
Express he waited for about 45 minutes in the crew's quarters, then
he and three others decided to run for it through doors blocked by
flames.
   ``I wasn't going to sit down and get burned to death,'' McDonald
said. ``You either stayed where you were and burned to death or you
tried to get out.''
   He said they fought past men on packed stairways to the lower
levels of the platform, and ``I just forced my way through the
flames,'' and slid down a hose and jumped. ``The water was red
hot,'' McDonald said.
   Tony Sinnett, 34, was on the nearby support ship Tharos because
of a shortage of beds on the Piper Alpha.
   ``There was nothing that anybody could do,'' he said. ``It was
totally hopeless. It was like the platform had been hit by an
atomic bomb. There was massive mushrooms and flames shooting into
the air. I just thanked God I wasn't on board.''
   John Maxwell, another rig worker, also watched from the Tharos
as some of the more than 200 workers tried to get off the platform.
   ``We were in our survival suits ready to go to the rescue when
we saw the drill derrick giving way, falling toward the pipe deck
and possibly on the accommodation (crew's quarters) _ I don't
know,'' he said.
   ``If there were men inside then, they couldn't have survived.
They couldn't have survived all that heat.
   ``The heat was blowing out the windows. ... Panes of glass were
all cracking off and the ferocity of the heat would suck all the
oxygen out and the men inside would have smothered. It was
terrible.''
   Bill Elder, 48, a burly Scot who also had been on the Tharos,
said he watched men slide down pipes and hoses on the side of the
blazing platform.
   ``Some were swimming from the ship,'' he said. ``I felt
helpless, sick. There was panic all around. We saw 10 guys waving
from the deck. There was nothing you could do.''
   He waited at a hotel in a dirty undershirt and blue sweat suit,
cap stuffed in his pocket, to tell his story to investigators.
Elder arrived in Aberdeen by helicopter, with other survivors and
witnesses, more than 12 hours after the disaster.
   Rig worker Dave Lambert said the deck collapsed as he tried to
find a way through the flames. ``The cabin slid forward and a hole
appeared, so we made for it and jumped,'' he said. ``We fell in the
sea. It must have been 60 or 70 feet.''
   ``It was stay and get toasted or jump and chance it in the
water,'' said Lambert, 38. He was in the water several hours before
a rescue boat reached him.
   Bill Lobben, 27, his hand burned, one wrist in a cast, said he
was watching a movie when the explosion shook the platform.
   ``We didn't see any flames so I went down and got warm gear and
a survival suit and then went on the pipe deck,'' he said.
   ``There was a lot of flames and smoke there. There were more
explosions and the rig just dropped suddenly to one side. I was
terrified. I shielded myself and jumped into the water.''
   Lobben clung to a piece of debris and swam to the Tharos.

   Iraq said its warplanes bombed oil
targets in southwest Iran on Thursday, while Iran announced that
its air force raided military positions along its southeastern war
front.
   A war communique carried by the official Iraqi News Agency said
Iraqi bombers destroyed oil installations at Imam Hassan oilfield
and Ghorah in an attempt to keep Iran from using its petroleum
resources for ``aggressive purposes.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian
fighter-bombers hit Iraqi military positions east of Basra in
southwestern Iraq.
   Both agencies were monitored in Nicosia.
   IRNA gave no specific casualty toll but said Iran's air raids
``inflicted substantial losses and casualties upon the enemy.''
   The Iraqi agency said all Iraqi air force jets returned safely
after carrying out 91 combat missions in a campaign to throttle
Iran's economic lifeline.
   No independent confirmation of the raids was available, nor did
the Tehran and Baghdad governments immediately comment on each
other's claims.
   Both Iran and Iraq reported border skirmishes in various sectors
of their 730-mile) front in the nearly 8-year-old war.
   The Iraqis have driven the Iranians out of their southern
bridgeheads on the Faw peninsula, the Salamcheh sector in the south
and the oil-rich Majnoon islands north of Basra in consecutive
assaults in the past three months.
   The last Iranian foothold left on Iraqi soil is the northern
Kurdish mountains, where the Iraqis recently claimed to have
recaptured more than a dozen peaks in heavy fighting.
   From Manama, Bahrain, came reports by shipping executives that
radio monitors picked up a distress signal in the Persian Gulf on
Thursday from a vessel that identified itself as a Romanian
freighter and gave a location close to Iran's Farsi Island.
   The executives said, however, that six hours later, they still
had not determined that it was authentic and thought it might be
another hoax.
   Distress signals purportedly sent by two other vessels Wednesday
were not confirmed.
   The executives, who spoke on condition of not being identified,
said the waterway might be suffering from a wave of hoaxes by
irresponsible radio operators, exploiting the tense situation
following Sunday's downing of an Iranian airliner by a U.S.
warship, killing all 290 aboard.

<HEAD>Malaysian Trade Official's Citizenship In Jeopardy, Panel Told</HEAD>

   A Malaysian trade union official is threatened
with loss of his citizenship for discussing with American labor
leaders the issue of ending U.S. trade concessions for Malaysia, a
Congressional hearing was told Thursday.
   Eric Schwartz, program director of Asia Watch, a private U.S.
human rights monitoring group, said there are demands in Malaysia
to strip Vethamuthu David, opposition member of the Malaysian
Parliament and trade union official of his citizenship.
   David is under fire, he said, for discussing with America's
largest Labor Federation, the AFL-CIO, its petition to cancel trade
concessions given Malaysia under the U.S. system of preferences for
developing countries.
   Schwartz quoted AFL-CIO officials as telling him talks with
David did not influence their decision to file the petition.
   David was detained on his return to Malaysia from attending the
AFL-CIO convention as a guest last October and only recently
released. He was among more than 100 people detained without trial
last autumn under the Malaysian Internal Security Law.
   AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty said the union wanted Malaysia
removed from the concessions group because, among other reasons, of
its violations of the rights of labor leaders to associate.
``Malaysia's violation of the right of free association is not
confined to the illegal detention of David,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators offered a $5,000 reward
Thursday for information leading to an arrest in the placing of 13
homemade bombs under bridges and behind buildings in this community.
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms offered the reward
because of the ``inherent danger to the public safety caused by the
explosive devices,'' said spokesman Joe Thurman.
   The bombs were found Tuesday in this small southern Indiana
community about 30 miles north of Louisville, Ky. Some of the
devices detonated, causing small fires, but no one was injured.
   Thurman said investigators continued to canvass the business
district and neighborhoods, searching for clues that might lead to
a suspect.
   ``We keep hoping each lead we run down is the one, but so far we
don't have any suspects,'' he said.
   Thurman declined to say whether investigators had been able to
track down the source of the dynamite used to make the devices,
which were found in paper grocery sacks.
   ``We're not going to talk about the device components. We'd just
as soon keep quiet about that,'' Thurman said. ``It's normal
procedure. The people we're looking for don't need us to tell them
what we're looking at.''
   Thurman said there were about 35 outside investigators working
on the case, representing the ATF, the FBI, the Indiana State
Police and the U.S. Army.
   ``It's just a big investigation, and it's taking some time to
run down the leads,'' Thurman said.
   Life for the 6,000 Salem residents had returned to normal by
Thursday.
   ``There's no areas blocked off, or anything like that,'' Thurman
said. ``As far as I can see, things are back to normal _ other than
you have a town full of strangers here running around asking
questions.''
   He said residents had been urged to report any suspicious
packages.
   ``We hope there aren't any more out there, but people should be
aware that there could be another one out there. We hope we got
them all,'' Thurman said.

<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee on
Thursday proposed legislation that would permit bank holding
companies to underwrite many securities.
   The long-awaited bill from Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
also would require banks to cash Social Security and other
government checks and abolish an agency set up to sell property
from insolvent savings institutions.
   It would reverse, in large part, restrictions on the mixing of
investment and commercial banking that have been in place since the
1933 passage of the Glass-Steagall Act.
   Securities subsidiaries of bank holding companies would be able
to underwrite and deal in corporate bonds, commercial paper,
municipal revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and
other kinds of loans.
   Banks would be precluded from underwriting in two major
securities areas: corporate stocks and mutual funds. However, the
subsidiaries would be able to sell mutual funds underwritten by
others.
   The legislation provides for various ``fire walls'' to prevent
losses in the securities affiliate from affecting the safety and
soundness of bank deposits.
   Other provisions require securities subsidiaries to be regulated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also, to prevent any
confusion by consumers with insured deposits in a bank, the
securities subsidiary could not share a name, logo, advertising or
location with an affiliated bank.
   This is St Germain's second try at fashioning a bill that would
attract enough votes to pass his committee. In March, a week before
the Senate passed broad legislation including bank underwriting of
mutual funds and corporate stock, St Germain offered a much more
restrictive bill.
   The latest effort is more permissive. In a statement, St Germain
called it a ``consensus document'' and predicted it would get broad
support in his committee and on the House floor. Aides said a
committee vote likely will be held by the end of July.
   However, a spokeswoman for the banking industry's largest trade
group, the American Bankers Association, said bankers, who support
the Senate bill, are disappointed with the proposal.
   ``The price of paying for new consumer protections far outweighs
any benefits banks would get from entering new areas,'' ABA
spokeswoman Mary-Liz Meany said.
   In return for getting new powers, banks are being asked to cash
government checks presented by non-customers, a measure aimed at
helping Social Security and welfare recipients who can't afford to
maintain a bank account. They also will be required to offer
low-fee ``lifeline'' checking accounts for depositors with less
than $1,000.
   Also, the bill gives a break to big competitors of banks _
so-called non-bank banks owned by Sears and other commercial
companies _ which make loans or accept deposits but not both. A law
enacted last summer restricted a non-bank bank's growth to 7
percent a year. However, St Germain's legislation would lift the
limit for two years.
   And, the bill curbs expansion of banks' insurance and real
estate powers.
   An unrelated provision abolishes the Federal Asset Disposition
Association, which has been accused of wasting money and doing a
poor job of disposing of loans and real estate from closed savings
institutions.

<TEXT>
   Record-breaking heat continued to scorch states in the upper
Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes Thursday, while thunderstorms
flooded parts of western Kansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle and the
northern Texas Panhandle.
   As temperatures climbed into the upper 90s and low 100s, at
least two dozen cities broke temperature records for the date.
   In Elkins, W.Va., Thursday was the ninth day that a temperature
record has been broken since June 1.
   Many of the records broken Thursday had stood more than a
century; for example, Erie, Pa., broke a record that existed 114
years.
   Record highs for Thursday included Akron, Ohio, 99; Albany,
N.Y., 97; Binghamton, N.Y., 91; Charleston, W.Va., 99; Cleveland,
97; Detroit, 100; Duluth, Minn., 95; Elkins, W.Va., 93; Erie, Pa.,
94; Flint, Mich., 98; Fort Wayne, Ind., 102; Harrisburg, Pa., 100;
Huntington, W.Va., 99; Mansfield, Ohio, 97; Marquette, Mich., 95;
Muskegon, Mich., 93; Pittsburgh, Pa., 101; Rochester, N.Y., 97;
Sault Ste. Marie, Mich, 96; South Bend, Ind., 97; Toledo, Ohio,
101; Williamsport, Pa., 100; Youngstown, Ohio, 98; Washington,
D.C., 101.
   In parts of the Oklahoma Panhandle, some 2 inches of rain fell
Thursday morning, and widespread flooding was reported east of
Guymon, Okla., with Highway 3 under water.
   Flooding also was reported in Texas, where Highway 136 was under
water between Borger and Stinnett. Three inches of rain was
measured near Oberlin, Kan.
   Strong thunderstorms were developing across eastern Colorado and
southeast Wyoming, and a severe thunderstorm watch was effect for
those regions.
   While record highs were being set in many places, a few U.S.
cities also saw record low temperatures for the date, including
Macon, Ga., with 58 degrees and Wilmington, N.C., with 59.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 105
degrees at Needles, Calif., to 57 degrees at Crescent City, Calif.,
and Fort Ord, Calif. The low temperature for the nation Thursday
morning was 29 at West Yellowstone, Mont.
   The national forecast Friday called for hot weather to prevail
again throughout much of the nation. Showers and thunderstorms
should be scattered from the central and southern Plains into the
central Rocky Mountain region, throughout the Gulf Coast region
into the Florida Panhandle, and over central New England.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 90s throughout much of
the eastern third of the country, with some temperatures
approaching 100 in the Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio
Valley. Temperatures in the 80s were expected in the Pacific
Northwest, the Rocky Mountain region and Great Plains. Highs should
reach the 90s in eastern Montana and Nevada, with 100s in the
desert Southwest and 70s along the northern California coast.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Warsaw Pact defense
ministers on Thursday that their activities help ensure peace, the
official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   It gave few details of the Kremlin leader's meeting with the
participants in what was termed a regular session of the defense
ministers' committee of the Warsaw Pact.
   ``We put high value on the cooperation of the armed forces of
the Soviet Union with the armies of our allies and friends,'' Tass
quoted Gorbachev as saying. ``Peaceful endeavor of our peoples,
world peace, depends in many ways on you, on the far-sightedness of
your political approach.''
   Gorbachev's meeting with the ministers was the top story in
``Vremya,'' the Soviet television news program.

   A grieving Indian man went from corpse
to corpse, searching for five relatives in the dimly lit
refrigerated warehouse used as a morgue for victims from the Iran
Air jetliner downed by U.S. Navy missile fire.
   Iranian guides removed the lids from rough wooden coffins and
unwrapped the plastic from around several bodies to display the
corpses, many of them mutilated by the crash.
   ``Its a terrible thing that the superpower has done,'' said the
weeping Indian to a group of Western journalists. He would give his
name only as Farid.
   While morgue employees were preparing the bodies of at least 38
foreign victims to be returned home, those of most of the Iranian
victims were flown to Tehran for a mass funeral Thursday.
   In Tehran, tens of thousands of people lined up behind the
coffins, which were draped with Iranian flags and borne on
pallbearers' shoulders to Martyrs' Cemetery. The streets
reverberated with cries of ``Revenge, revenge!'' and ``Death to
America!'' as the cortege wound through the city.
   To visit the morgue, reporters flew to Iran from Dubai in the
United Arab Emirates to the southern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas.
Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down Sunday while flying in the
opposite direction.
   Several guides wore handkerchiefs around their faces to keep out
the stench of death in the makeshift morgue. The refrigerators of
the Mostaan Cold Storage Depot, which held 100 bodies, could not
totally conceal the odor.
   As reporters talked with the Iranians, Farid looked at the face
of each body. He finally discovered those of his sister and
brother-in-law. He sobbed as he touched their faces and arms.

   Independent counsel James McKay said Thursday
he has referred his 830-page report on Attorney General Edwin Meese
III to the Justice Department, a step which could result in an
ethics review of Meese.
   McKay sent the report, the result of a 14-month criminal
investigation of the attorney general, to Solicitor General Charles
Fried in Fried's capacity as acting attorney general.
   Fried ultimately will have the authority to turn it over to the
Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates
accusations of improper conduct within the Justice Department.
   For now, however, the special three-member federal appeals court
which appointed McKay has issued an order which directs that those
holding copies of the report not discuss it with anyone.
   Asked whether an ethics review was imminent, Justice Department
spokesman Patrick Korten said only that the report ``is being
handled in the ordinary course.''
   Acting on an order by the appeals court panel, McKay also sent
the report to Meese's lawyers _ Nathan Lewin and James Rocap _ who
refused to take reporters' telephone calls. A secretary in their
office, citing the court order, said the attorneys weren't
permitted to discuss the report with anyone.
   McKay said April 1 that if he decided that no criminal
prosecution of Meese was warranted, he would refer all the matters
he had investigated to ``the appropriate administrative
authorities.''
   When Meese announced his plans Tuesday to leave the government
in late July or early August, his aides said there wouldn't be an
Office of Professional Responsibility probe because of the attorney
general's impending departure. On Wednesday, however, after other
Justice Department sources disputed that assessment, Korten
acknowledged that an ethics review by OPR was possible.
   OPR has the power to recommend sanctions ranging from reprimand
to dismissal, but it also in the past has conducted reviews of
employees who were leaving the department.
   The Justice Department's deputy attorney general, Harold
Christensen, and Associate Attorney General Francis Keating,
outrank Fried, but are filling their jobs on an acting basis.
Therefore, the report was referred to Fried.
   McKay said anyone who believes he or she is named in the report
and wishes to respond should notify the independent counsel's
office, which will provide the portion of the report relating to
that person.
   McKay's office launched a criminal investigation of Meese on May
11, 1987, and ended it Tuesday by submitting the report to the
court.
   The independent counsel has been examining the involvement of
Meese, at the request of his longtime friend E. Robert Wallach,
with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. in 1981 and 1982, when Meese was
White House counselor. McKay also has been looking into Meese's
involvement, again at Wallach's behest, on behalf of a $1 billion
proposed Iraqi oil pipeline project in 1985.
   McKay reviewed the attorney general's meetings with and decision
on behalf of executives of the regional Bell telephone companies at
a time when he held $14,000 in telephone stock.
   The independent counsel also looked into the fact that members
of a Washington real estate family, through a foundation, arranged
to pay a $40,000-a-year salary for Meese's wife while leasing
office space to the Justice Department.
   Wallach was involved with Meese in both the phone stock and Mrs.
Meese's job.

   The Navy had to destroy a Trident 2
missile in flight Thursday night, the second failure in 13 test
launchings of the new submarine-based missile, authorities said.
   The 44-foot, $23.7-million missile, carrying a dummy warhead
package, blazed away from a land launch pad at 6:38 p.m. EDT after
a flawless countdown and darted quickly into heavy clouds. But the
Navy later issued a statement reporting a problem developed during
first-stage flight.
   The range safety officer sent a radio signal 60 seconds after
liftoff to blow apart the missile so that pieces would fall
harmlessly into the Atlantic Ocean and not threaten land, the Navy
said.
   The statement said the cause of the malfunction could not be
determined immediately.
   The three-stage Trident 2 was to have hurled its warhead package
to an Atlantic Ocean target several thousand miles to the
southeast. The weapon has a range of nearly 6,000 miles but its
intended range Thursday night was not disclosed.
   The test was the 13th of 20 land pad launches planned here, to
be followed by at least five submarine launch tests. The weapon is
scheduled to become operational late next year.
   The test program began in January 1987 and reeled off nine
straight successes before logging a failure last January. It had
recorded two more successes before Thursday night's malfunction.
   Each Trident 2 is designed to hurl up to 10 nuclear warheads to
different targets. There are to be 24 of the weapons aboard each of
nine planned Trident submarines.

   The Senate on Thursday adopted a $14.3 billion
fiscal 1989 foreign aid bill that would revive U.S. contributions
to the World Bank, which makes development loans to Third World
countries. The vote was 75-15.
   The measure has been remarkably without controversy this year,
in part because of last year's agreement between Congress and
President Reagan that smoothed the way for this year's money bills.
   If signed into law, the bill would be the first free-standing
foreign aid money bill to be completed since 1981. Since then, aid
money has been rolled into large omnibus spending measures each
year.
   The Senate version would provide $71 million as the U.S.
contribution to a recapitalization of the World Bank under a new
five-year commitment to boost lending authority.
   The Senate rejected an attept by Sen. J. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H., to withhold the aid unless the bank changed its practices
to make loans no more favorable than those available from other
sources to U.S. borrowers.
   But the Senate did adopt an amendment offered by Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, to withhold $1.2 billion in U.S. contributions to
all multilateral development banks if needed to meet next year's
deficit-reduction target.
   The House version of the bill, which was approved May 25, does
not include the World Bank contribution, and would need additional
authorizing legislation before the money could flow.
   The legislation is the primary vehicle for U.S. economic and
military aid to friendly foreign countries. As usual, the largest
chunk of aid goes to Israel, which would get $1.2 billion in
economic and $1.8 billion in military assistance. Egypt is the
second-largest recipient, with $815 million in economic and $1.3
billion in military aid.
   Other major aid allocations include the Philippines, which would
get $125 million in military aid, $124 million in economic aid and
$40 million for development; $500 million to an African development
fund, $101 million to an international drug control program. Turkey
would receive $500 million in military aid and Greece $350 million.
   In Central America, El Salvador would receive $185 million in
economic support, Guatemala $80 million, Costa Rica $90 million,
and Honduras $85 million.
   The bill also would continue a ban on aid to Panama, where
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega continues to defy U.S.
efforts to remove him from power, including elimination of Panama's
lucrative U.S. sugar sales quota.
   The bill also includes a cut in aid to Pakistan, which would
receive $210 million in economic and $220 million in military aid.
The total is $10 million less than the House earmarked and $60
million less than the administration requested.
   Pakistan has received favorable treatment in recent years
because of its status as a conduit for U.S. aid to the anti-Soviet
rebels in neighboring Afghanistan. As the Soviet Union withdraws
its troops, some in Congress are beginning to call for a
re-examination of U.S. aid.
   In addition, the bill makes available $50 million to aid Afghan
refugees and $362 million for other refugee programs, $157 million
for the Peace Corps, $40 million for an international program to
combat AIDS and $1 million for the Solidarity trade union in Poland.

   A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry
on Thursday denied statements by U.S. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz that Iran recently tried to open direct talks with
Washington, it was reported.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said the Foreign Ministry dismissed claims by Shultz that
Iranian officials had sent messages through third parties
indicating a desire to open diplomatic discussions with the United
States.
   The unidentifed Foreign Ministry spokesman described Shultz's
claim as ``futile efforts'' to divert world public attention from
Sunday's downing of an Iranian passenger airliner by a U.S. missile
cruiser in the Persian Gulf. All 290 people aboard the jetliner
were killed.
   The New York Times published a report Wednesday quoting Shultz
as saying, ``we've had a number of probes ... from Iran through
various third parties saying that they'd like to talk with us, and
we've responded to those.''
   The newspaper said Shultz declined to identify the Iranian
officials involved and that he would not speculate on what effect
the airliner attack might have on the previous proposal.
   The Iranian spokesman said Shultz's report also aimed at cooling
down the fury of the Iranian people over the U.S. ``crime and
legitimizing its illegal military presence in the gulf.''

<HEAD>Son of Ex-NFL Star Bart Starr Found Dead in House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 24-year-old son of former NFL quarterback
and coach Bart Starr was found dead Thursday in a suburban Tampa
house leased by his father, police said.
   Bart Starr summoned police after he arrived at the home of his
son, businessman Bret Michael Starr, discovered a foul smell and
couldn't get in, said Hillsborough Capt. Gary Terry.
   ``The place was locked up tight. The body was lying on the floor
in a dining area that opened into a backyard. It had been there an
estimated two to four days and the air conditioning was off,'' said
sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa.
   Police said the body was badly decomposed. There were no obvious
wounds and no signs of a struggle, Terry said.
   Two Rottweiler dogs were found alive in the home, police said.
   Authorities said they would have to await an autopsy report from
the Hillsborough County Medical Examiner's office to find out how
Starr died.
   Bart Starr, who lives in Arizona, was quarterback of the Green
Bay Packers during the team's glory years of the 1960s. He led the
club to five NFL titles during the decade and was voted most
valuable player in Super Bowl I and II.
   He coached the Packers from 1975-83, compiling a 53-77-3 record,
and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.
   Bret Starr moved to Tampa in late 1984 and was part owner of a
wholesale exotic fish and reptile importing company called Gulf
Coast Fisheries. He said at the time he chose Tampa for his
business because of the ``growth and climate and location for
import and distribution.''

   Apple consumption in the United States has
risen to a record 20 pounds per person this year, good news for
growers saddled with last year's largest crop in history, the
Washington Apple Commission said Thursday.
   The nation has produced about 130 million 42-pound boxes of
apples this season, with Washington growing about 67 million of
those, the commission reported.
   ``We never had the supply nationally to really find out if
people would eat more apples,'' said Charles St. John, spokesman
for the industry marketing group based in Wenatchee.
   ``A lot of skeptics have said the industry cannot increase apple
production because Americans will not eat more apples,'' St. John
said. ``This year we've found that people will eat more apples.''
   Using its own unofficial projection methods, the commission has
determined that apple consumption will be 21.6 pounds per person
this year, up significantly from last year's 18.4 pounds per
person, St. John said.
   That is the only time since 1970, date of the earliest research,
that apple consumption has topped 20 pounds per person, he said.
   Normal consumption since 1970 has been 17 to 18 pounds per
person, with a high of 19.9 pounds in 1975, which was another
bumper crop year, St. John said.
   Consumption has been pushed up this year by the combination of a
massive crop, low prices and extensive marketing activities.
   Washington's 67 million boxes in 1987 easily eclipsed the
previous year's record of 55 million boxes.
   But the huge crop lowered prices to below the $9.50 per box cost
of production for much of the year.
   Only since the first of the month have prices jumped up, and
currently are up to $19 per box for top grades, according to Market
News Service.
   ``This year has been an economic disaster from the grower's
perspective,'' said St. John, although the consumption projections
provide a silver lining in that dark cloud.
   The current apple season ends in August, when the remaining 4.4
million boxes of Washington apples still in storage will be gone,
St. John said.
   Early projection for the 1988 crop indicate it will be smaller,
because of this year's low prices and because irrigation water
supplies in the Yakima Valley are lower than normal due to last
year's Northwest drought.
   The projections were created by the commission, which used
production reports from around the nation, subtracted known exports
and divided the remainder by the nation's population, St. John
said. ``We came as close as we can to a true domestic consumption
figure,'' he said.
   Washington, which accounts for about 90 percent of apple
exports, has shipped a record 12.2 million boxes to other nations
so far this year, well above last year's 5.2 million boxes.
   The U.S. consumption figure does not take into account imports
from other nations, so consumption may actually be higher, St. John
said.
   The projections assume all apples shipped to the fresh market
are sold and do not include apples processed into juice, applesauce
and other products, he said.
   The amount of apples sold for processing, for less money, varies
each year and depends on how many were undesirable for the fresh
market because of weather damage or undesirable color. About a
quarter of Washington's crop usually goes to processors, but up to
a third of the 1987 crop was unfit for the fresh market. In other
growing areas, up to half of the crop may go to processors.

   A bomb placed by a gang of
gunmen exploded against the inside wall of a public swimming pool
building Thursday, killing two people and wounding four, police
said.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the bomb apparently was meant
to bring the wall down on a security patrol that was passing by in
the Falls Road, a predominantly Roman Catholic area of west
Belfast, but the timing was wrong.
   The explosion missed the patrol and all the casualties were
civilians, including a 4-year-old girl who was slightly injured.
   A police spokesman said a group of armed men came into the
building and ordered swimmers to leave. They held the pool staff at
gunpoint while they placed the explosive device. Police said the
gunmen escaped and the bomb exploded a while later.
   Those killed in the explosion were a 60-year-old woman and a
24-year-old man, police said.
   Asked if anybody telephoned to warn police about the bomb in the
interval between the gunmen's escape and the explosion, a police
spokesman said: ``You'll have to draw your own conclusion about
that.''
   The Falls Road is a guerrilla stronghold and the implication of
the spokesman's comment was that no warning was telephoned either
because those involved feared guerrilla reprisals or because they
sympathized with the guerrillas' cause.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police said
it bore the hallmarks of an attack by the outlawed Irish Republican
Army. The mainly Catholic IRA targets security forces in its
guerrilla war to end British rule in predominantly Protestant
Northern Ireland and unite it with the overwhelmingly Catholic
Republic of Ireland under socialist rule.

   The first Soviet official ever to
visit Camp Lejeune watched U.S. Marines train Thursday and gave the
``thumbs up'' sign as a Harrier jet completed a vertical takeoff
and roared over the reviewing stand.
   ``I do believe he was impressed,'' said U.S. Navy Adm. William
J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who
accompanied the Soviet Marshal Sergei Fedorovich Akhromeyev.
   Crowe related that Akhromeyev, who is on a tour of military
installations, tapped him on the shoulder and gave him the sign as
the two watched the demonstration at the base.
   Akhromeyev, chief of the general staff of the Soviet Union,
watched a task force exercise involving Marine infantry units,
tanks, helicopters and in-flight refueling, as well as the Harrier
attack jets, which lift into the air from a standstill.
   ``He (Akhromeyev) wanted to talk to them (the Marines),'' Crowe
said. ``He is very pleasant and easy to be with. It's an historic
occasion and I'm proud to host him.''
   Gen. Alfred M. Gray, commandant of the Marine Corps, said after
the demonstration that he suggested a joint training operation with
the Soviets to Akhromeyev, chief of the general staff of the Soviet
Union.
   ``He just laughed,'' Gray said.
   The Soviet delegation, which includes ranking officers from most
of the Soviet armed forces, arrived at New River air station
Thursday morning on a U.S. Air Force jet from Washington. The
group, which arrived in the United States Tuesday, is scheduled to
stay in the country at least through Monday.
   ``One of the goals for this visit is to enhance the credibility
of deterrence by giving him a feel for the quality of our military.
Seeing is believing, and believing is important in this business,''
said Army Lt. Col. Arnold Williams, a Pentagon spokesman.
   Crowe and the Soviets are scheduled to visit the Navy's newest
aircraft carrier, the Theodore Roosevelt, in the Virginia Capes
region. They also will observe Army main battle tanks at Fort Hood,
Texas; and see a new B-1B bomber in South Dakota.
   The field marshal and his party, which includes ranking officers
from most of the Soviet armed forces, will attend a rodeo and
barbecue on a cattle ranch in Oklahoma and see the Alamo in San
Antonio, Texas, on Saturday. Other stops include colonial
Williamsburg, Va., and New York City.

   As growling front-end loaders bit
giant chunks of debris from what had been his department store,
owner Bernard Levine voiced amazement at being alive.
   ``I was lucky. God was with me. Not a scratch,'' he said.
   At least seven people died and 60 were injured when the roof of
Levine's three-story Amigo Store collapsed during a driving
rainstorm.
   Three hundred rescue workers, using everything from dump trucks
to wheelbarrows, carefully dug into the debris hoping to find
survivors.
   ``I need an ax,'' one worker high on the pile of debris shouted
in English, then Spanish.
   Hundreds of onlookers, held back by police sawhorses, strained
to get closer to the site.
   As Police Sgt. Dean Poos prepared to brief reporters, a woman
approached and asked in heavily accented English, ``Children?''
   ``No children,'' the policeman replied somberly.
   U.S. Border Patrol and Customs agents brought in dogs which
usually hunt drugs to search for people possibly trapped.
   The rubble _ crushed cinderblocks, broken brick and glass,
twisted steel _ was speckled with remnants of merchandise Levine
had been selling moments before disaster struck.
   T-shirts, caps, hats, a little girl's dress were strewn in with
the piles broken concrete.
   Several dozen rescue workers formed a human chain up the nearly
three-story mound to hand debris down, piece by piece. Officials
ordered them to move carefully, fearing that sudden shifts might
cause a further collapse. Portable lights were hauled in so work
could continue through the night.
   The light brown building was 19 years old and located on one of
Brownsville's main downtown streets, about a block from the
international bridge across the Rio Grande from Matamoros, Mexico.
   Police Officer Javier Saenz, who was near the store when the
roof caved in, was among those who struggled to find survivors.
   ``When we got to the front of the business, we saw two persons
that already looked dead. They were just between the cement, the
concrete or whatever,'' Saenz said.
   The policemen said he and other officers managed to rescue five
people from a breach in the wall of the adjacent store. ``We took
them out through the wall at Woolworth's,'' he said.

On Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis on Thursday questioned
Republican George Bush's ``rather late'' commitment to affirmative
action and accused the vice president of breaking his pledge not to
support new taxes.
   Dukakis, before heading West for three days of presidential
campaigning, also called again on President Reagan and Bush to
support trade legislation that includes a plant-closing
notification provision.
   He refused to say whether he would select a running mate next
week, but with Democratic National Convention less than two weeks
away, conceded he would have to make up his mind ``in the not so
distant future.''
   Bush, the presumed Republican nominee, promised Wednesday that
he would appoint a Hispanic to his Cabinet if elected president.
   ``It strikes me that this is a rather late commitment,'' said
Dukakis, who made a similar pledge a year ago. ``I don't know where
he has been for the past eight years.''
   Like Bush, Dukakis refused to extend an absolute commitment to
women and other minority groups but invited examination of his
state appointments and said his record on affirmative action stood
in ``dramatic contrast'' to the Reagan-Bush administration.
   ``I expect to have women, black citizens, Hispanic citizens,''
Dukakis said.
   Dukakis flew to Dallas, where he spoke to the annual convention
League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC. A day earlier,
Bush spoke to the same group and made his pledge to appoint a
Hispanic American to his cabinet.
   The Massachusetts governor continued to jab at Bush.
   ``Some people think it's enough to wake up after eight years and
then promise opportunity for one Hispanic. I want to stand with you
and create opportunity for 20 million Hispanic citizens across the
country,'' he said.
   ``I've campaigned fom one end of this country to another, and I
know that we Americans are ready for a change,'' Dukakis added.
``We're tired of waiting for opportunity to trickle down from a few
privileged neighborhoods into our cities and into the small
communities of rural America.''
   Dukakis made some of his remarks in Spanish.
   Earlier, in Boston, Dukakis said Bush had broken his pledge to
oppose any new taxes by supporting a provision of the trade bill
that calls for $1 billion in taxes for job training programs and
catastrophic health care legislation that included $6 billion in
taxes on elderly people who opt for the comprehensive care.
   ``So much for iron-clad no tax commitments,'' said Dukakis, who
himself had to renege on a no-tax pledge in his first term as
governor.
   Bush, who was in Dukakis' hometown for the day, hit back.
   ``I'm against raising taxes, and I think recent events here in
this state that I don't plan to go into demonstrate we have a
different view on taxes,'' he said. That was a clear reference to
Dukakis' recent signing of a cigarette tax and the governor's
support for another tax-hike measure.
   The Bush campaign also quarreled with Dukakis' assertion.
   ``The vice president's campaign pledge not to raise tax is
iron-clad and it's not going to change,'' added Mark Goodin, a Bush
spokesman. He said neither of the proposals Dukakis mentioned
involved tax increases.
   ``He is dead wrong on both counts and he is trying to blow smoke
into the room,'' Goodin said.
   Reagan earlier this year vetoed major trade legislation because
it contained a provision requiring employers to give 60 days'
notice before closing plants. The measure has won overwhelming
Senate approval for a second time and is awaiting action in the
House.
   ``The president opposes it, the vice president opposes it, I
don't know why,'' Dukakis said.
   Dukakis said American workers deserved such notice and said the
issue represented ``the fundamental difference in what a Democratic
administration would mean to this country.''
   Dukakis has been dogged at home by a fiscal 1988 deficit and a
struggle to balance the budget for fiscal 1989, which began last
week.
   Legislation to erase the defict and close the books on fiscal
1988 is working its way through he Legislature, although portions
of the administration's plan remain controversial, and a compromise
on the new budget was reached Wednesday.
   Dukakis said he expected final passage of both by the end of
next week.
   ``If there is one thing we are committed to doing in this state
it is to making sure we have a strong fiscal foundation,'' Dukakis
said.
   Some local Dukakis critics have contended that the governor has
been late dealing with budget problems because he is preoccupied
with his search for a running mate, a process which included
interviews with eight contenders in the past two weeks.
   Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn removed himself from consideration.
Dukakis said that none of the remaining seven have been ruled out.
They are Sens. John Glenn of Ohio, Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee,
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Bob Graham of Florida, Reps. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton of Indiana and Jesse Jackson.
   Paul Brountas, Dukakis' campaign chairman and closest adviser,
has been in Washington this week researching the vice presidential
contenders and is expected to remain there through Friday. Dukakis
is due back in Boston late Saturday.
   Dukakis aides expect Dukakis and Brountas to meet during the
weekend and predict an announcement next week.

   A Navy petty officer charged
with murdering a disbursement officer during the robbery of a
$94,000 payroll had plenty of money and was wrongly accused, his
lawyer said Thursday in opening arguments.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Ruben Colon, 34, had saved more than
$100,000 and was preparing to leave the service after 15 years, the
attorney, Lt. Matthew Michels, told a court-martial panel.
   However, prosecutors told the five-officer panel that Colon was
tailed by Navy investigators to the bank where $87,000 in cash and
2,575 U.S. Treasury checks were found in a safe deposit box rented
in Colon's name.
   Colon, of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, faces the death penalty if he
is convicted of the murder charge. The Navy has not executed anyone
since an 1849 mutiny.
   Lt. j.g. Ratish Prasad, disbursing officer of the destroyer John
Hancock, was bound, strangled and shot with a .38-caliber handgun
March 15 in a robbery of the warship's payroll. The weapon has
never been found.
   Michels argued there was nothing to link his client to the
slaying or to the items found in the safe deposit box.
   ``There are no fingerprints on the money or checks or the (safe
deposit) box,'' said Michels, calling the government's case purely
circumstantial.
   Evidence submitted to the court shows that Colon's driver's
license was used as proof of Florida residence to purchase a
.38-caliber revolver three days before the robbery-murder.
   But store clerk Cheryl Crismas of Southside Guns, who testified
said she sold the weapon March 12, said she listed the purchaser as
Ruben ``Cohen'' and she couldn't identify the defendant in court.
   Dr. Bonifacio Floro, deputy chief medical examiner for the City
of Jacksonville, conducted an autopsy on the victim's body and
concluded that the primary cause of death was a gunshot fired at
point-blank range into Prasad's left temple. He said the victim was
``probably kneeling when he was shot in the head.''
   Larry D. Smith of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement
Crime Lab testified the ropes that bound Prasad's feet and neck
were similar to rope found in Colon's apartment. But Smith said he
could find no fiber evidence from the victim's clothing or the
crime scene to match that of the defendant's.
   Investigators had ``two primary suspects that should still be
suspects,'' Michels said.
   The prosecutor, Lt. Daniel Glary, told the jury that Colon
bought a .38-caliber revolver three days before the robbery-murder.
He also said witnesses will testify that Colon lied about his
movements during and after the slaying.
   ``Much of the government's case is circumstantial ... but the
case against this defendant is devastating,'' Glary said.
   Colon, who was Marine Corps military police officer before his
Navy service, is a qualified weapons expert and was an electronic
warfare technician for the Navy.
   He is also charged with the victim's kidnapping, which carries a
life sentence; robbery, with a 15-year sentence; and receiving
stolen property, with a three-year sentence.
   It takes a vote of at least four of the five jurors to convict
on any of the charges. But the death penalty cannot be considered
unless the murder conviction is unanimous.
   The prosecution said it would introduce a bank witness who will
testify that Colon rented the box in which the cash and checks were
found by agents of the Naval Investigative Service. The agents were
tipped off by bank officials who became suspicious about renting
out their largest box to a sailor.
   Shortly after the robbery-slaying, Colon took leave and told
friends upon his return that he was going to leave the Navy so he
could provide a better living for his family.
   Michels told jurors that Colon had fathered a child seven years
ago while stationed in the Philippines and that the mother had
recently joined him here.
   Colon was arrested April 12, almost a month after the crime.
   The judge, Cmdr. John A. Studer, said he expected the military
trial to last about two weeks.

   The nation's two largest financial markets took
a joint step Thursday toward averting another stock crash,
proposing reforms that include special attention to small investors
and coordinated trading halts when the Dow Jones industrial average
falls 250 points.
   The announcement by the boards of the New York Stock Exchange
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange addressed many of the key issues
raised by government studies on the causes of the October crash,
particularly the need for cooperation between the nation's
financial markets.
   It also marked the most comprehensive action yet taken by the
securities industry to reform itself since then and convince
millions of crash-burned investors that the markets are safe and
fair.
   Had the joint measures been in place Oct. 19, the unprecedented
508-point plunge in the Dow average would have been averted.
   ``We have developed a program of coordinated procedures which
serve the current needs of financial markets,'' CME Chairman Leo
Melamed said. ``These combined initiatives demonstrate our
commitment to serving the needs of all investors and ensuring a
level playing field for all market participants.''
   NYSE Chairman John Phelan said that although markets have
returned to more normal patterns, ``there is still a perception
that individuals are at a disadvantage in today's high-speed
markets. The initiatives approved by the boards should overcome
that concern.''
   All of the initiatives must be approved by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which oversees the nation's stock markets, and
the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the
futures markets.
   The steps include a system for expediting trading orders of
individual investors to the NYSE floor on heavy trading days.
During the crash, many individuals were unable to sell their stock
quickly because the market's system was clogged with sell orders
from large institutional investors.
   Both exchanges also proposed a one-year experimental system of
coordinated ``circuit breaker'' mechanisms to forestall panicky
selling when the Dow average is falling rapidly.
   Under this system, which must be approved by other markets and
the Securities and Exchange Commission, all trading on the NYSE
would be halted for an hour if the Dow average falls 250 points,
and for two hours if the average falls an additional 150 points the
same day.
   At the CME, the key Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index future
could fall a maximum 30 points before trading would be halted. A
two-hour halt would be called if the S&P index future fell another
20 points the same day.
   If the S&P index fell a total of 50 points in one day, that
market could not reopen. But the NYSE would have the option of
reopening after a two-hour halt.
   The experimental reforms are aimed at taming the wild price
swings in both markets that some crash studies have attributed to a
trading method called index arbitrage, in which brokerages use
large computers to sell stocks and buy stock-index futures, or vice
versa, to profit from momentary price discrepancies.
   The NYSE implemented a temporary measure called the ``collar''
in February aimed at quelling the effect of index arbitrage.
   The collar banned use of the NYSE's computer system for that
method on days when the Dow average rose or fell 50 points from the
previous close, but its effect was controversial. Some critics said
that it worsened volatility by severing an important link between
the cash and futures markets.
   Phelan said the new measures would supercede the collar limit,
which is scheduled to expire in August. But he said the NYSE
reserved the right to impose additional restrictions if volatility
returned.

   Police said Thursday they had few clues to
who punctured orange juice cartons with hypodermic needles at three
suburban markets this week and left notes warning of poison.
   A national expert on product tampering warned that widespread
news coverage of the cases could prompt ``copycat'' crimes and
noted there were more than 700 reports of product tampering across
the country last year.
   No one drank from any of the juice cartons, discovered Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday at three supermarkets within a few miles in
the San Fernando Valley suburbs. Police tests were incomplete, but
one grocery store test cleared the first carton of cyanide
contamination.
   Investigators have yet to find anyone who saw any of the
tampering and are hampered in fingerprint checks because of the
number of people who handle cartons in stores, said police Lt. Fred
Nixon.
   ``We're treating it as very high priority despite the fact that
we don't know for certain that there is contamination present. In
either case it's still a crime,'' Nixon said.
   Police advised consumers, particularly near the affected stores,
25 miles northwest of downtown, to check cartons before buying.
   The three supermarket chains involved, Vons, Hughes and Alpha
Beta, all stepped up security in stores in the area, company
spokesmen said. Involved were two national orange juice brands,
Coca Cola Co.'s Minute Maid and Procter & Gamble's Citrus Hill.
   In each case, a two-quart carton of orange juice was removed
from the refrigerator case and punctured with the needle from a
hypodermic syringe. The cartons, with the needles still attached,
were found by customers or employees on shelves elsewhere in the
markets, each with a note attached suggesting poison had been
injected.
   California law makes threats of tampering with food or drugs a
misdemeanor and actually contaminating a product a felony. The FBI
is evaluating the case to see if federal felony tampering statutes
apply, said spokesman Fred Reagan.
   Investigators withheld some details of the tampering to make it
easier to identify possible imitators.
   Research suggests that one nationally publicized case of product
tampering leads to 30 ``copycat'' crimes across the country, said
Park Elliott Dietz, a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville who studies such cases and has consulted for the
FBI.
   ``The major determinant of how many cases there will be in the
next three months is how widely this is publicized,'' Dietz said in
a telephone interview. ``The consensus of how to handle this is to
make sure the public is informed about potential risk _ in that
geographic area.''
   According to statistics from the Food and Drug Administration,
threatened and actual product tampering increased ninefold in 1986,
to 1,698 reported cases, after the death of a New York woman who
took a poisoned Tylenol pain capsule.
   In 1987, the FDA received 774 consumer complaints of tampering
with food, drugs and other regulated products, and confirmed 84
cases of tampering with packages or their contents.
   Cases of threats combined with some form of tampering, as in the
California incidents, are much more rare, said Richard Swanson,
director of emergency operations for the FDA. He wasn't able to
provide statistics on such cases.

   Striking movie and TV
scriptwriters announced Thursday they overwhelmingly approved an
interim contract that will put writers back to work for at least 13
production companies, including the makers of the ``Rambo'' movies.
   Members of the Writers Guild of America, who cast ballots
Wednesday night in New York and Los Angeles, approved the interim
pact by an 8-1 margin, union President George Kirgo said Thursday.
   ``This will help bring this town back to work,'' Kirgo said,
referring to the 18-week strike that has stalled production in
Hollywood and forced postponement of the start of the fall
television season.
   The interim contracts with independent producers are a union
effort to split the ranks of the industry's bargaining group, the
Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
   Thirteen companies have already signed the new deal, including
Carolco Pictures, makers of the ``Rambo'' movies, and actress
Shelly Duvall's Platypus Productions Inc., union officials said.
   ``The significance of this vote for the industry is that there
is one remaining obstacle to getting this town back to work, and
it's not the Writers Guild of America,'' said Brian Walton,
executive director of the union's western division.
   Walton predicted that the new interim agreement, in conjunction
with a previously approved independent contract, would mean 300 to
500 writers would resume work in coming weeks.
   Walton said the producers' alliance is pressing independent
companies to spurn the interim pact.
   The union earlier approved a different independent contract, and
as of Thursday 124 mostly small production companies had signed
that pact.
   ABC and CBS officials said earlier Thursday they wouldn't use
any programming made by independent producers. NBC and Fox
Broadcasting Co. officials had said they would not enter into new
deals with independent production companies that signed contracts
with the WGA during the strike.
   ``We strongly believe that the economic issues remaining in this
labor dispute with the WGA are directly related to the long-term
viability of the television industry,'' ABC Entertainment President
Brandon Stoddard said through a spokeswoman.
   ``We feel that independent production companies, tempted to sign
the interim agreements, would be prolonging the strike and
contributing to further industry uncertainty without gaining any
real advantage,'' she said.
   ``CBS completely supports the industry position in its dealings
with the Writers Guild. We do not believe it is in the best
interests of any producer to sign the interim agreement the WGA is
offering. In support of that position, we will not enter into any
new agreements for product produced under the interim WGA
agreement,'' the network said in a statement issued Thursday.
   ``The economic issues in this labor dispute bear importantly on
the continued health of our entire industry. It is clearly in
everyone's best interest to end this strike as soon as possible. We
believe that acceptance of the WGA interim agreement will prolong
this strike to the disadvantage of all,'' the statement said.
   ``NBC's greatest hope is that this lengthy strike comes to a
swift settlement, and the writers go back to work. We don't feel we
are in a position to give economic or business advice on a series
of complex issues,'' NBC said in a statement released in New York.
   NBC earlier had confirmed separate agreements to continue
production of ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World,'' ``ALF,''
``Highway to Heaven'' and ``Amen.''
   Guild leaders believed a model interim contract could be used to
lure a studio, network or additional small production companies to
break ranks with the alliance. More than 100 independent production
companies have already signed interim contracts with the WGA,
allowing some writers to go back to work.
   Among those who have been able to resume writing is cartoonist
Garry Trudeau, writer of the ``Tanner '88'' series on cable
television's Home Box Office.
   The strike started March 7 after the two sides could not agree
on payments for television reruns and foreign television
syndication.
   Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox studios said it was imposing forced
vacations on several hundred employees beginning July 11. The WGA
strike has placed the start of the fall television season in
jeopardy and has resulted in sweeping layoffs among California's
230,000 entertainment industry employees.
   The alliance has stated publicly that its last contract offer,
rejected by the WGA on June 22 by a 3-1 margin, was final.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, campaigning on Michael
Dukakis' home turf, hailed the ethnic background of his Democratic
rival before an audience of Greek-Americans Thursday and disavowed
any responsibility for an attack against Dukakis on religious
grounds.
   ``I know how proud you are of Michael Dukakis,'' Bush said in a
speech to a conference of laity and clergy of the Greek Orthodox
Church.
   ``What a tribute it is to Greek-Americans, to our political
system, and to this great country of ours that we find it totally
natural that the son of an immigrant is one of two men still
contending to be president of the United States,'' said Bush,
certain to be the Republican nominee.
   Bush got a warm reception from the audience of several thousand
of Dukakis' fellow Greek Americans. His address was delayed more
than 45 minutes _ until after 10 p.m. _ by other speakers and the
singing of Greek songs. He joked to the audience that it was wise
to have Dukakis and himself appear on different days.
   ``Too much charisma can be dangerous to your health,'' he said
to laughter.
   At a news conference earlier, Bush turned aside questions about
Dukakis' role as Massachusetts governior in handling the state's
budget and overseeing its economy.
   ``I don't want to get into these details,'' said Bush, who on
other occasions has relished attacking Dukakis. ``I prefer to be
positive and tell you what to do to lead this country ...''
   The vice president was asked his view of a widely distributed
letter written by James Jatras, a staff member of the Senate
Republican Policy Committee and a Greek Orthodox Church layman, who
called Dukakis ``a renegade, an outcast'' for his positions and for
his marriage to a Jew.
   ``I'm not going to get into that,'' said Bush. ``That did not
emanate from me and I had never heard of it before.''
   Archbishop Iakovos, the primate of the Greek Orthodox Church in
the Americas, has said the attack was ``extremely unjustified'' and
that Dukakis was a steadfast son of the church.
   In his speech, Bush identified with the values of the
Greek-American community. ``Family, faith, education, hard work _
those are the keys and no one knows it better than you,'' he said.
   ``It's the same message you preach in your homes, the same way I
was raised, the same way Barbara (Bush's wife) and I raised our
family.''
   While praising Dukakis' heritage and saying he did not want to
criticize him, Bush went on to do exactly that, saying the two
candidates had ``a different view on taxes.''
   The Massachusetts governor recently signed a cigarette tax.
   Bush also said he would try to make clear ``who has the most
experience, who (is) best to sit down with (Soviet leader Mikhail
S.) Gorbachev.''
   The vice president added that the Reagan administration ``has
achieved the only arms control agreement in the nuclear age to
eliminate an entire category of weapons when some were sitting up
here saying `Freeze, freeze' _ lock in Soviet superiority with a
thousand warheads and zero for the United States.''
   On another matter dear to Greek-Americans, Bush expressed hope
for a resolution of Greek-Turkish differences over Cyprus.
   He said the administration encourages dialogue. ``We pray for
reconciliation and we seek for Cyprus a constitutional democracy
based on majority rule, the rule of law and the protection of
minority rights,'' he said.
   At his news conference, Bush said his strategy, with the help of
surrogates, will be to put Dukakis' record on public display. He
said one recent poll found that two-thirds of the people surveyed
thought Dukakis was more conservative than Bush.
   ``There's something wrong with that,'' Bush said. ``The issues
are not in focus ... I honestly believe that the country doesn't
yet fully appreciate where the governor stands ... on a lot of key
issues.''
   Bush faulted himself for not making clear ``what makes me tick
inside.''
   He said, ``I've not felt too comfortable talking about the
private side of the Bush family and all of that _ what it means to
me, the loss of a child, whatever it might be.''
   ``I now have concluded that I have to make clear what makes me
tick inside,'' he said, referring to a speech Wednesday before a
Hispanic audience in which he talked at some detail about his life.
   Bush said, ``I was trying to say, look, I understand this is
what motivates me, here's the inner side.''
   He jokingly said he ``wasn't trying to draw a contrast that
we've got 12 grandchildren and he's (Dukakis) working for one.''
   However, the vice president's wife quickly corrected him on the
number of grandchildren and Bush said, ``Make that 10.''

   The Reagan administration on Thursday combed
through a ``pretty long'' list of candidates for attorney general
in hopes a successor to Edwin Meese III can be nominated before
Congress recesses late next week for the Democratic National
Convention.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the White House is
moving ``as rapidly as possible,'' but ``it's not the end of the
world'' if the search goes beyond the convention recess. The
Democrats meet in Atlanta July 18.
   With another recess scheduled for the Republican convention in
mid-August, it appears that only the least controversial of
prospects could be confirmed before September. Meese, long an
object of campaign debate, has said he will leave office in late
July or early August, now that he has been ``vindicated'' by an
independent counsel's decision not to seek an indictment against
him.
   Some successor prospects would have to undergo a vigorous FBI
background check. But others already have been investigated for
other top-level positions, and their reviews would only need to be
updated, according to FBI spokesman Bill Carter.
   The ideal time for an early confirmation vote would appear to be
in the first two weeks of August, before the GOP convention break.
The Senate doesn't plan to return until the second week of
September.
   The Judiciary Committee, which would conduct the confirmation
hearing, already has a heavy schedule the last week in July,
including confirmation sessions for those nominated as top Justice
Department deputies.
   ``They've got time to get somebody in, but it depends who it's
going to be,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., who has presided
at the committee's judicial confirmation hearings.
   ``If they go with competence rather than ideology, they can get
somebody in easily. With the right person it can be done in August.
Everybody would bend over backwards to work it out. But nobody's
going to rubber stamp a candidate,'' he said.
   Added Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah: ``I think the administration
is going to have to make up its mind next week.''
   Fitzwater said, ``There really isn't anything new except to say
that we are proceeding with the collection of names and processing
of individual candidates, and we would like to have a nominee
before the Congress recesses'' for the Democratic convention the
week of July 18.
   Fitzwater said the White House list is still ``pretty long. I've
seen a number of news reports with a lot of names in them, and you
take the longest one, and we're at least that long.''
   Among those mentioned as possible successors to Meese: former
Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada; former House Republican
Leader John Rhodes of Arizona; the former Democratic attorney
general under Jimmy Carter, Griffin B. Bell; Reagan's first
attorney general, William French Smith; former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; former White House Chief of Staff Howard
H. Baker; Washington attorney Judith Richards Hope, a nominee for a
federal appellate judgeship and the daughter-in-law of comedian Bob
Hope; and acting Deputy Attorney General Harold Christensen.
   Also, former American Bar Association President Eugene Thomas;
Lois Haight Herrington, chairman of the president's Conference for
a Drug-Free America; Carla Hills, former Republican secretary of
housing and urban development; William D. Ruckelshaus, former
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh; Howard T. Markey, chief judge
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington,
and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
   A statement issued Thursday by Laxalt's law office said he was
not interested in the position and is committed to remain with the
office he opened less than a year ago.
   ``In addition, no one has approached the senator about accepting
the job,'' the statement said, adding that reports Laxalt could be
a successor to Meese ``amount to nothing more than speculation and
rumor.''
   Hatch said Christensen, from the senator's hometown of Salt Lake
City, would be the most logical choice, because he already has
received a background check for his nomination as deputy attorney
general. Christensen's confirmation hearing is set for July 28.
   The senator, who has spoken to the White House, said Christensen
and Laxalt are among those under consideration. ``They know I'd
support Laxalt,'' Hatch said. He declined to name anyone else under
consideration.
   Meanwhile, Meese said Wednesday he would have handled his role
in connection with scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. differently if he
had known at the time ``that this was a gang of crooks.''
   ``Obviously, ... if you had total knowledge of what was going to
be revealed later ... then there might be things you do
differently,'' Meese said in an interview with reporters.
   ``For example, in the Wedtech matter, which was handled like I
would any other ... If I had known or anybody had known ... that
this was a gang of crooks, there would have been quite different
handling of the situation, obviously.''

   Members of Congress attending a series of
closed-door Pentagon briefings appear convinced that the United
States bears no blame for the mistake that led to the shooting down
of a commercial Iranian airliner and the killing of 290 people.
   Lawmakers said several factors _ a skirmish with Iranian patrol
boats, electronic data that made the approaching plane appear to be
military and intelligence information that indicated heightened
chance of a major attack _ combined to justify the decision of the
captain of the USS Vincennes to fire two missiles at an unseen
target.
   ``The ship's captain had every reason in the world to feel
threatened,'' Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said after one briefing Wednesday. ``I don't
think he had any choice but to shoot it down.''

   With the smallest wage increases of any
industrial nation and help from a sinking dollar, U.S. factories
outperformed their foreign rivals last year in reducing labor costs
and making their goods more competitive on world markets.
   Measured in devalued American dollars, labor costs in the United
States declined 1.5 percent in 1987, compared with increases of 7.5
percent in South Korea, 7.7 percent in Canada, 13.5 percent in
Japan and 23.9 percent in West Germany, the Labor Department said
Wednesday.
   But even before the dramatic devaluation of the dollar against
major European and Asian currencies, the United States outperformed
all but Japan in keeping a lid on labor costs.

   Holding enough votes this time to override a
veto, Democrats are forcing a second election-year showdown with
President Reagan over giving workers advance notice of plant
closings and large layoffs.
   On a 72-23 vote Wednesday, the Senate passed a bill requiring
companies to give 60 days' notice before shutting down any
operation or instituting a layoff affecting more than 50 people or
a third of the work force.
   President Reagan cited the mandated notices as his primary
reason for vetoing a massive overhaul of the nation's trade laws
two months ago, saying advance notices would reduce U.S.
competjob creation.

   Increases in food prices should remain
moderate this year despite the drought as the nation begins to draw
on its large grain reserves, says the Agriculture Department's top
economist.
   ``The immediate problem is not one of food shortage or food
price inflation, except in certain specific instances, but rather
the problem is one of responding in a compassionate way to the
losses faced by American farmers,'' Assistant Secretary of
Agriculture Ewen M. Wilson said Wednesday.
   Appearing before three House subcommittees, Wilson forecast
tight supplies of soybeans and oats. He also acknowledged that
while the winter wheat harvest is actually ahead of schedule, there
has been severe damage to spring wheat and much of the corn crop is
in bad shape.

   Pall-bearers Thursday paraded 76 flag-draped
wooden coffins through Tehran's streets, where thousands of
mourners shouted their anger at the United States for shooting down
an Iranian jetliner and killing all 290 people aboard.
   ``No compromise! No surrender! Fight with America!'' shouted
waves of marchers, who carried wreaths, anti-American posters and
golden-framed photographs of the victims.
   The mass funeral started with a fiery speech from Iran's
president, Ali Khamenei, who mocked American statements on the
incident and calling for revenge.
   ``The case is not closed in the opinion of those who are seeking
retribution,'' he said, referring to a remark by President Reagan
that no more could be said about U.S. responsibility after one of
its missile cruisers shot down the Iran Air jetliner over the
Persian Gulf on Sunday.

   U.S. commanders in the Persian Gulf were on
the lookout over the July 4th weekend for Iran's F-14 fighters,
advanced aircraft recently stationed at the mouth of the Gulf of
Hormuz, but seldom _ if ever _ flown in combat by the Iranians.
   The administration has said the commander of the USS Vincennes,
Capt. Will C. Rogers III, thought he was under attack by an Iranian
F-14 when he fired two SM-2 anti-aircraft missiles and destroyed
Iran Air flight 655, an A-300 Airbus with 290 civilians aboard.
   But the F-14 is primarily designed for combat against other
aircraft. And Pentagon sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Iran hardly ever flies any of its few
operational F-14s, and has never risked one in a shooting situation.
   ``Iran has never used an F-14 in combat,'' said one U.S.
military source with gulf experience. ``They have sent them up to
escort tankers, and put them up when Iraqi fighters were around,
but they always veered off and stayed out of danger.''

   The Soviet Union launched an unmanned probe
Thursday night on a six-month trip to Mars' moon, Phobos, for a
mission designed to pave the way for a manned voyage to the red
planet.
   The launch of the 180-foot-tall Proton rocket carrying the
probe, Phobos I, was carried live on Soviet television, which
reported that the spacecraft's flight was proceeding normally.
   More than a dozen nations are participating in the mission to
swoop close to the surface of Phobos and drop probes onto the
little, potato-shaped Martian moon that scientists say may hold
clues to how the universe was formed.
   A companion probe, Phobos II, is scheduled for launch on July 12.
   If all goes well, the two spacecraft will enter the
gravitational pull of Mars in January 1989 and fall into orbit just
behind Phobos for a three-month remote study of the surface and
atmosphere of the planet. In April, the craft will drop out of
their orbit and swoop to within 30 yards of the moon's surface,
where they will release two small landers.

   Unusual formations on the surface of Mars _
including a mile-long rock shaped like a human face _ may have been
carved by a lost civilization or could be just ``a trick of
nature,'' four scientists said Thursday.
   In either case, they said, the mysterious outcroppings demand
further scrutiny by spacecraft.
   The scientists, including a former astronaut, said that a
photograph taken of the Martian surface in 1976 by NASA's Viking
spacecraft clearly shows a face that could have been carved out of
a Martian mountain a half million years ago.
   And the sphinx-like image that stares outward from the planet
may be part of a complex, as evidenced by other unusual formations
nearby, which was built by a civilization that has since
disappeared, the scientists said.
   Or, they admit, it could all be ``a trick of light and shadow.''

   Children under 5 are more likely to be run over
and killed in parking lots or by their parents backing down the
driveway than they are in traffic, a study shows.
   ``Older children are injured and die from darting out into
traffic,'' said Dr. Robert J. Brison, the study's principal author.
``Younger children seem not to have that pattern of injury. They
seem to be injured most commonly in a home driveway or in a store
parking lot.''
   Such tragic deaths are especially likely to occur in families
that drive a light truck or van, said Brison of Queen's University
in Kingston, Ontario.
   Brison, who practices emergency medicine at Kingston General
Hospital, said in a telephone interview Thursday that parents of
young children ``need to be aware of this pattern of injury, so
that they can put the children in a safe area, such as a playpen,
or pick them up'' before backing out of the driveway.

   Most of the nation's top goals for babies and
pregnant women _ including a hoped-for reduction in the infant
mortality rate _ will not be met by the 1990 target date, federal
health officials said Thursday.
   ``It's certainly sobering and concerning,'' said Dr. Ann Koontz,
a specialist with the Health Resources and Services Administration
in Rockville, Md. ``This indicates that we have some significant
problems relating to maternal and infant health.''
   The government in 1979 published its 1990 health objectives for
the nation, including 13 top-priority goals relating to pregnancy
and infant health. Only three of those 13 goals are likely to be
met, the national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday in its
weekly report.
   The CDC, using National Center for Health Statistics data,
projects that the nation's infant mortality rate _ infants dying
before age 1 _ will be 9.1 per 1,000 live births. That's a drop
from the 10.6 rate in 1985, but still short of the 9.0 rate in the
1990 objectives.

   The House, grappling with one of its most
sensitive political issues, sidestepped a decision Thursday on
whether to let the Pentagon shut down unneeded military bases.
   The chamber was considering a pair of plans setting up complex
mechanisms and procedures for closing some of the 3,800 military
installations around the nation. Pentagon officials estimate that
between $2 billion and $5 billion annually could be saved by
shutting unneeded bases.
   But after a preliminary test vote, the chamber dropped the bill,
in part because the debate had run longer than scheduled. House
members generally do not work past Thursday afternoons, permitting
members from Western states to return home for election-year
campaigning.

   Vice President George Bush, hoping to steal
thunder from Michael Dukakis, is likely to break with tradition and
go on the road stumping for votes and media attention during the
Democratic National Convention.
   The plan, Bush said, is to ``get a little bit of ink'' while the
spotlight is on Dukakis and his nomination as the Democrats'
presidential candidate.
   Traditionally, presidential candidates keep a low profile during
the nominating conventions of their rivals. President Reagan, still
playing by those rules although he is not running this year, will
be at his mountaintop ranch in California when the Democrats meet
in Atlanta July 18-21.

   Southern California faces a 60 percent
chance and the San Francisco Bay a 50 percent chance within three
decades of being rocked by a major earthquake that could kill
thousands of people, the U.S. government said Thursday.
   ``Unless we aggressively pursue earthquake reduction measures,
there is the potential for many people to die, perhaps more people
than ever died in a single day from any disaster in the United
States,'' said Richard Andrews, deputy director of California's
Office of Emergency Services.
   The report by the U.S. Geological Survey and a working group of
its National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council deals only
with the San Andreas, Hayward, San Jacinto and Imperial faults.
   So, with other major faults such as the Newport-Inglewood Fault
in Los Angeles excluded from the report, the likelihood of large
earthquakes ``may significantly exceed the probabilities we
present,'' said geophysicist James Dieterich of the Geological
Survey and other authors of the report.

   The war over, their industries wasted and their
recovery prospects dim, the Japanese attached themselves to a
concept that, as much as anything else, helped them rise up from
the ashes.
   The concept was industrial quality, which presupposes that you
offer a customer the very best you can produce because that, and
nothing less, is what the customer expects.
   In concept or practice it wasn't new. Americans had learned the
trick years before, and its authorities on the subject were quite
willing to share their ideas. A flock of them trekked to Japan; the
Japanese listened and improved.
   Now, one of the great authorities on the subject, Armand
Feigenbaum, former manager of General Electric's worldwide
manufacturing operations, has finished offering a revolutionary
idea to the Soviets.
   The notion: The customer is always right. And what the customer
wants, needs, demands is quality.
   On reading that advice, most people consider it too obvious for
comment. But the fact of the matter is that it isn't at all.
   Time after time companies have fallen on bad times because they
forget it. Repeatedly, companies have resurrected themselves on
rediscovering it. And not just companies but entire nations, as
witness the Japanese.
   The notion was all but lost in the labyrinthic Soviet production
system, which for decades has emphasized production goals over
customer needs, and thereby affirmed one of Feigenbaum's basic
no-nos, to wit:
   ``The wrong way is for the manufacturer of a product or the
provider of a service to satisfy his own perceived internal needs
at the expense of the customer's requirements.''
   The message was delivered last month to an audience at the 32nd
annual conference of the European Organization for Quality Control,
made up mostly of Russians bent on improving Soviet production and
export prowess.
   Will the Russians take heed as the Japanese did? And as much to
the point: Will Americans remain competitive by practicing quality
control; or will they forget, as they did for 20 years or so prior
to the 1980s.
   Feigenbaum, author of ``Total Quality Control,'' a bible on the
subject, is now president of General Systems Co., a Pittsfield,
Mass., company that installs quality control systems throughout the
world.
   These are some of the points he made to the Russians, and which
he suggests might draw the attention of American producers of
products and services:
   _Quality is everybody's job but it will become nobody's job
unless management provides operating systems that support the work
of individuals and promote teamwork among individuals and
departments.
   _Quality and cost are partners, not adversaries. The essence of
both higher quality and lower costs is fully effective use of
resources. Anything less produces waste, which means higher costs.
   _Automation is no substitute for quality. Unless installed as an
integrated part of an overall quality system, automation merely
produces the same bad products faster.
   _Quality is not just a technical function or department. It is
an operating system that extends throughout the organization and
provides the social stability and economic efficiency essential to
quality.
   _Quality improvement doesn't come through sloganeering, bumper
stickers, occasional quality fireworks called campaigns, or the
dusting off of a few traditional quality-control techniques.
   Customers perceive quality and they relate it to price. Quality
shows through, he says, and when it isn't there it doesn't take
long for the customer to know it ... in Japan, the United States or
the Soviet Union.

   One-time friends say the man they knew
as Dr. Michael J. Kelley told them he came here for a quieter life
of medical practice and part-time teaching at the University of New
Mexico medical school.
   Kelley seemed to have a physician's demeanor and plenty of
medical knowledge. He wore a white lab coat embroidered with his
name and told stories about his teaching job.
   But it turns out that nobody at the university had ever heard of
him and that the New Mexico Medical Examiner's Board had no record
of a Michael J. Kelley being licensed to practice medicine in the
state.
   And now his former friends _ remembering inconsistencies in his
story that they once glossed over _ say they are embarrassed and
angry they wee taken in by a man they describe as confident,
extroverted, entertaining and smart.
   They're troubled by his criminal past and the story of his
relationship with a teen-age boy who died.
   And they're relieved that one acquaintance ``outconned the
con,'' as an investigator put it, and helped bring about his arrest.
   A Bernalillo County grand jury returned a 34-count indictment in
April charging him with multiple counts of practicing medicine
without a license in Albuquerque in 1986 and 1987.
   ``He was so successful at convincing very well-educated people
that he's something he's not,'' said Bill Copeland, the district
attorney's investigator who handled the case. ``Part of his motive
was he loved the high lifestyle. He enjoyed status, enjoyed the
high roller-type lifestyle.''
   Kelley, whose real name is Gerald Thomas Lampkins, was arrested
in Tempe, Ariz., in February and is being held in the Bernalillo
County Detention Center in lieu of $250,000 cash bond, awaiting
trial.
   Lampkins, whose birthdates listed on arrest records put him at
51, 54 or 56, surfaced in Albuquerque early in 1986, allegedly
passing himself off as a wealthy endocrinologist and surgeon whose
heart problems forced him to leave a busy and prosperous practice
in New York.
   The part of the story about heart problems may be true; Copeland
says Kelley issued medication to himself as Lampkins for treatment
of a heart condition.
   Kelley allegedly prescribed Ibuprofen, a muscle relaxant, to one
woman who complained to him of lower back pain. To another friend
he allegedly prescribed an antibiotic after she experienced a
negative reaction from a flu shot. He is not accused of performing
examinations or surgery, but of issuing prescriptions.
   His lawyer, public defender Richard Knowles, declined to allow
his client to be interviewed, saying, ``I just don't like the idea
of going to trial with newspaper clippings.''
   Authorities say Lampkins' criminal record dates back to the
early 1950s and that his convictions range from kidnapping to
making false statements. He's served time at the federal
penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan., for violating the Selective
Service Act and for other offenses in state and county prisons in
Missouri and California.
   Then there's the story of his relationship with 18-year-old
Ronnie Teunis.
   Kelley and Teunis, who lived together in the former's opulent
Oakland, Calif., apartment, took out a $100,000 life insurance
policy on each other in November 1982. Teunis died in a motorcycle
accident two weeks later. The district attorney's office in Oakland
has closed the case, according to investigator Nicole Lee.
   But it's not closed as far as Allstate Life Insurance Co. is
concerned.
   Kelley collected $203,365 from Allstate, a sum that included
interest and payment on a double indemnity clause. The insuror now
is trying to recover the money plus $600,000 in punitive damages,
contending that Kelley, or Lampkins, misrepresented himself as
Teunis' stepfather.
   A newspaper's legal notice of the insurance company's suit added
to Albuquerque friends' vague uneasiness about Kelley.
   ``Things would happen to sow a seed inside you, but then nothing
would happen for a while,'' said a woman whose family regularly
invited Kelley to dinner and parties.
   A small, balding man described by friends as slightly effeminate
and given to talking dramatically with his hands, he was good
company, highly intelligent, schooled in the arts and
well-traveled. He drove a Mercedes-Benz and carried a business card
saying he was a Ph.D. as well as a medical doctor.
   The woman and her husband, who spoke on condition they not be
identified, said Kelley avoided doctors whom they tried to
introduce him socially and sometimes gave inconsistent accounts of
his marital status _ divorced in one version, widowed in another.
   He wept while telling about the motorcycle accident that killed
Ronnie, they said. But he said it happened in New York, not
California, and that the boy was an underprivileged youth his
family had taken in.
   Every time Kelley piqued the couple's suspicions, the wife said,
he'd offer a gift or a compliment _ ``something nice to overcome
the feelings I had.''
   But the legal notice was too much. The couple discussed their
suspicions with a friend who passed them on to Cheryl Boll, a
Placitas, N.M., kennel owner who had befriended Kelley through
their mutual interest in dogs.
   ``I think several people began snapping to this person who was
not who he said he was. But she pegged him as a phony and a
manipulator. Eventually she out-conned the con guy,'' Copeland, the
prosecutor's investigator, said of Mrs. Boll.
   ``I talked to him almost every day,'' she said. ``Basically I
played a role as his dearest and best friend. Call me Judas. That's
a good name.''
   Her motivation, she said, was to stop a phony doctor. She
eventually told what she knew to the district attorney's office.
   An arrest warrant accusing Gerald Thomas Lampkins of practicing
medicine without a license _ and listing more than six aliases _
was filed last Feb. 12.
   Lampkins, who had fled Albuquerque after being served with the
Allstate summons three months earlier, was then living in Tempe,
Ariz.
   Lt. Stephen Graehling and other Tempe officers knocked on his
door.
   ``We stood around for a few minutes,'' Graehling says. ``He came
out the back door, which empties onto a golf course, and tried to
run out back. But I had two deputies out back who arrested him. He
didn't run very far.''

<TEXT>
   Director Ingmar Bergman is turning 70,
having reached what he calls the twilight of his career but basking
in a run of theater successes.
   Recuperating from a hip operation, Bergman is quietly
celebrating his July 14 birthday at his retreat at Faro, a rugged
island of beaches and pine trees in the Baltic Sea, with some of
his eight children and his fifth wife, Ingrid.
   Bergman, whose films probed emotions and relationships rarely
touched by others, says he has made his last movie. That was his
1982 triumph ``Fanny and Alexander,'' which won four Academy Awards.
   But he is hardly slowing down, and has theater productions
scheduled in Sweden until 1991.
   In April he scored a critical and box office sensation with his
stage production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night.'' His autobiography, ``Lanterna Magica,'' was a Swedish
bestseller when it was published last year.
   His Swedish-language production of ``Hamlet,'' put in a modern
setting, was panned by some critics here, but was a sensation in
Florence, Italy, and won a critics prize last year in London. It
played in New York in May.
   ``Hamlet is on the top 10 list of really good performances,''
Bergman said in a radio interview. ``It is the best I can do, which
means that I have reached quite far with it,''
   His next directing project will be Shakespeare's ``A Winter's
Tale,'' at Stockholm's 200-year-old Royal Dramatic Theater.
   Bergman was not always the cultural hero in Sweden that he is
today. His volcanic temper didn't help.
   ``He used to refer to anyone who didn't throw furniture around
as `inhibited,'' says Gunnel Lindblom, one of his leading ladies.
   In 1969 he was fined heavily for hitting a theater critic known
for his sharp reviews.
   ``And it was worth it,'' Bergman said.
   Today he says the critics don't bother him as much.
   ``I don't even get angry,'' he said in the radio interview. ``Of
course when you were young you took it very hard and were very
hurt. But not after 45 years.''
   Now, he says, ``everybody is very kind to me. ... I suppose it
is because I have become old and harmless.''
   His many love affairs, often with women starring in his films,
drew more attention in Sweden than his art. But his latest marriage
_ his fifth _ has lasted since the early 1970's.
   In his memoirs he regrets what he describes as his earlier
fickleness and attributes it to sexual obsession.
   ``There were very many years of my life when I was so occupied
with what I was doing that I forgot wives and children. Now since I
am older it has been very nice and rewarding to get to know my
children,'' he said.
   Bergman was Sweden's youngest theater director at 26 when he was
put in charge of the provincial Helsingborg City Theater in
southern Sweden. The theatrical tradition, he says, has always been
the real influence on his art.
   He is best known for directing more than 50 films, most of which
he wrote himself. He won three Oscars for best foreign films: ``The
Virgin Spring'' in 1960, ``Through a Glass Darkly'' in 1962 and
``Fanny and Alexander.''
   To mark the birthday, the Swedish Film Institute published a
special English-language edition of its magazine, Chaplin, paying
homage to the director who made his first film in 1944 and who
launched the careers of such international stars as Liv Ulmann,
Bibi Andersson and Max von Sydow.
   ``Bergman is probably the greatest film artist, all things
considered, since the invention of the motion-picture camera,''
wrote Woody Allen, one of a dozen international directors
contributing to the 90-page tribute.
   Sir Richard Attenborough, the British director, said Bergman
``extended the medium (of film) in a manner unequalled by any of
his contemporaries.''
   For some four decades Bergman divided his time between theater
and film, likening the two forums to ``my wife and my mistress.''
After ``Fanny and Alexander'' he said he was giving up his
``mistress'' and devoting himself to the stage. Since then he
produced only one Swedish television film in 1984, ``After the
Repetition.''
   ``Fanny and Alexander'' was a multi-levelled story of a
well-to-do family at the turn of the century, which appeared to
have traces of Bergman's own childhood with his clergyman father.
   The film marked Bergman's return to Sweden after six years in
self-imposed exile in West Germany. In 1976 he was hauled away by
police during a rehearsal and accused of tax violations. He was
cleared, but left the country in disgust.
   He is now back at the Royal Dramatic Theater, where he saw his
first play at the age of 12 and where he was the director from 1963
to 1966.

<HEAD>Widely Followed Weekly Report Is One Of Least Scientific Surveys</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They often are based on
seat-of-the-pants judgments rather than scientific measurements,
but the government's weekly crop reports are among the most eagerly
awaited figures for commodity traders, farmers and other drought
watchers.
   Another round of reports will be released Monday afternoon and
analysts will be looking to see how the nation's corn fields are
standing up to dry conditions during a pollination period that is
crucial to the survival of the crop. For soybeans, that
make-it-or-break-it point is still weeks away.
   In Iowa, like other farm states, the reports are assembled from
hundreds of questionnaires returned by farmer volunteers,
government employees and bank officers who make farm loans. There
are few yardsticks for the responses that, among other things, rate
crops from excellent to very poor. Participants say they rely on
their own judgment.
   ``It's probably one of the least scientific surveys we do.
However, it's the most popular release we have,'' says Duane Skow,
state statistician for Iowa for the Agricultural Statistics Service
of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ``It's a subjective report.
It's not based on measurements.''
   To farmers, the figures help in making decisions on when to buy
hay, corn or soybean meal to feed livestock or whether to sell
livestock and break up herds because of concern adequate feed will
be too costly in winter. Farmers also may use the reports to base
decisions on buying or selling crop surpluses or contracting for
future sales or purchases.
   Public policymakers are watching the figures as they consider
drought-relief programs. This year, for example, reports are being
distributed for the first time to members of the Iowa Legislature
and are being circulated to members of state drought task forces.
   Commodity firms, traders and market watchers view the figures as
an important benchmark for grain and livestock markets _ providing
regular progress reports on the condition of crops months before
the harvest, as well as assessments on the availability of grains
and grasses used as livestock feeds.
   ``These numbers are closely followed by grain trade analysts,''
says Robert Wisner, an extension economist and grain market
specialist at Iowa State University.
   ``They are used for a general indication of whether the crop is
improving or deteriorating in condition,'' Wisner said.
``Obviously, they are not precise enough to forecast exact yields
per acre, but these are good indicators.''
   Last week's report for Iowa, for example, indicated a slight
improvement in the soybean crop from the previous week, when
triple-digit temperatures blistered fields.
   In the June 27 report, none of the Iowa soybean crop was rated
excellent and 16 percent was graded poor. But on July 5, four
percent was given an excellent rating and 12 percent was poor.
   In general, a normal crop is considered good, better than that
is excellent and below normal is either fair, poor or very poor.
   The people who fill out the weekly questionnaires say it is
easier to distinguish between the excellent and poor crops than to
make distinctions between crops that are good or fair.
   ``Excellent and failure are real easy to identify,'' said
Richard Thuma, extension service director and agriculturalist in
Henry County in southeast Iowa, who has been participating in such
surveys for 36 years.
   But sometimes, a conversation with a farmer will determine how
some parts of the survey are answered.
   Is subsoil moisture inadequate?
   Thuma said it is when ``a farmer tells me he dug a fence post
three feet deep and didn't find water.''
   In Iowa, 427 questionnaires go out each Wednesday, asking for
ratings of crops, an assessment of the moisture content of the soil
and subsoil, progress on hay harvests and general comments on
livestock, weather effects, fertilizer supplies, soil erosion or
related topics. As the growing season progresses, questions are
added each week to track the progress of corn and soybean crops.
   Last week's survey marked the start of questions on corn
pollination, a critical period that will determine if kernel-filled
ears will develop.
   Tassels already have formed on some stalks and must drop pollen
on silks that are beginning to form on the ears. The silks must be
moist and sticky enough to catch the pollen,``otherwise you have a
cob without corn,'' Skow said.
   Survey participants are asked to complete the forms on Friday or
on Saturday morning, and replies received Monday morning in Des
Moines are tabulated and combined with data provided by the
National Weather Service and the state climatologist.
   Last week's Iowa report was based on 222 questionnaires returned
in time for use.
   Skow's office strives to avoid sensationalizing the reports _ as
he put it, ``to limit the adjectives.''
   A typical passage last week said: ``The rain and cooler
temperatures helped sustain the condition of Iowa's corn crop this
past week, particularly in the northern and western parts of the
state. Overall the corn was in fair-to-good condition.''
   This year in Iowa, because legislators restored cut funds
supporting such projects, the weekly reports not only give
statewide summaries, but also have restored a section that provides
figures on soil moisture and crop progress for nine areas of the
state.
   The people who compile and contribute to the report say that
even if ideal conditions return, the corn crop has suffered.
   ``I'm not one to overdramatize this situation, but I'm also a
realist,'' said Roger Brummett, a farmer and an agriculturalist at
the extension service in Taylor County who responds to the
questionnaires in his southwest Iowa community. ``We're looking at
a potential 40 percent to 60 percent (corn crop) loss right now in
this county.''

   After persistent reports of civil
rights abuses by Indian tribal governments, federal attorneys are
quietly pressing to close loopholes that deny constitutional
protection to Indians on reservations.
   ``We have complaints of people who have lost property or liberty
without due process,'' Brian Miller, counsel for the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission, told The Associated Press. ``We have evidence of
undue influence on judges.''
   He said the commission would hold hearings July 20, in nearby
Flagstaff, and then prepare a report for the White House including
evidence from four previous hearings held around the country since
August 1986.
   The new hearings will focus on the Navajo, the largest Indian
tribe, but complaints come from many of the nation's 260
reservations, Miller said.
   Meanwhile, the Justice Department is seeking an amendment to the
1968 Indian Civil Rights Act that would allow federal courts to
review civil rights decisions taken by Indian tribal courts.
   ``We see a lack of checks built into the tribal government
process,'' said James Schermerhorn, attorney for the Justice
Department. ``Violations are continuing, hence the need for federal
review.''
   Miller and Schermerhorn said they had received widespread
allegations of election abuse and favoritism based on political or
blood loyalties.
   In interviews on reservations, Indians who described themselves
as victims and private lawyers repeatedly likened the tribal
governments to small ``dictatorships'' or ``police states.''
   Stephen Pevar, a professor of Indian law at Denver University,
asked to comment on tribal governments he had visited, replied:
``The situation is an abomination.''
   Dennis Ickes, former deputy undersecretary of the Interior and
an Indian law specialist in Salt Lake City, told the Civil Rights
Commission earlier this year, ``This is our Gaza Strip.''
   He said tribal members were second-class citizens because ``they
have no recourse to a judicial system that is not subordinate to
the tribe's political body.''
   The issue is fiercely controversial because is revolves around
Indian sovereignty, established in a series of laws since
reservations were established in the last century.
   All 1.37 million Indians have U.S. citizenship, but in 1978 the
Supreme Court determined that tribal courts had the final word on
civil rights cases for the 332,000 Indians living on reservations.
   One problem, federal lawyers contend, is that Indian judicial
systems are often rudimentary and vulnerable to pressure from
tribal authorities.
   As a result, they say, a strong tribal chairman amounts to
president, chief justice and speaker of the House and is in a
position to control his own reelection.
   In the Navajo system, generally regarded as the best among
tribal courts, only two of 14 judges have law degrees, and no
tribal constitution sets out a separation of powers.
   Peter MacDonald, chairman of the 200,000-member tribe, told the
AP federal court appeal would violate Indians' sovereign status.
   He acknowledged he was the final authority in the Navajo Nation.
``It is an awful responsibility for one man,'' he said, ``but it is
in our customs and traditions.''
   Former Navajo chairman Peterson Zah, locked in a legal dispute
over what he calls arbitrary actions by MacDonald, takes a
different view.
   ``I am against the idea (of federal court appeal) because it
diminishes the sovereignty of Indians,'' he said. ``But this
government's actions have made it necessary. We will suffer, but we
have no choice.''
   One witness expected to testify to the commission is Robert
Walters, a Navajo judge fired by the tribal government. He told the
AP judges were controlled by threats.
   ``It is not a free country up there,'' he said. ``It is a
socialistic state. They tell you what to do.''
   Problems are general throughout much of Indian country, said
Butch O'Neal, an Indian development consultant and a Sioux who
lives on the Navajo reservation.
   ``It is scary when you think of it,'' he said. ``If you anger
someone, your whole family suffers. If deprived of property or
anything else, you have nowhere to go beyond the tribe.''
   O'Neal left his job as director of the Crownpoint, N.M.,
Institute of Technology when Peter MacDonald took over as Navajo
chairman in 1986 because, O'Neal said, he expected to be forced out
for political reasons.
   ``When (U.S.) presidents go, a lot of people lose their jobs,
but not the secretaries and janitors,'' he said. ``Here everyone
can get nailed.''
   In January, Assistant Attorney General John Bolton wrote to the
Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs about ``serious tribal
deficiencies in applying and enforcing'' the Indian Civil Rights
Act.
   More recently, Justice Department officials have been preparing
a memo to Congress requesting legislation to allow federal review.
   Bolton's letter cited testimony from commission hearings at
Rapid City, S.D., in August 1986, which alleged flagrant abuse on
several Northern Plains reservations.
   Former Chief Judge Trudell Guerue of the Rosebud Sioux in South
Dakota said that in one five-month period prior to the hearings, he
found more than 300 people arrested but not brought to court.
   ``We had people who'd stay in jail for 10 days without charges
being filed,'' he said.
   Ray Springer, a former Cheyenne River Sioux police officer,
testified he was forced to be a witness against himself in a tribal
court. ``If you're politically in, you're probably all right,'' he
said. ``(Otherwise) it runs right between fear and horror and just
total awe in the people.''
   Indians are divided sharply on federal court review.
   One proponent is Charley John, one of two judges MacDonald fired
in 1978 after they refused to allow him to use $70,000 to pay F.
Lee Bailey fordefending him against an Internal Revenue Service
audit.
   ``Most of the (tribal) judges are fearful,'' he said. ``I think
one good case brought before federal courts would put the fear of
accountability back into tribal government.''
   Another Navajo former judge, Tonny Bowman, told his non-Indian
interviewer, ``You have more rights on a reservation than Indians
do.''
   But John Chapela, a lawyer dismissed as head of the Navajo
Housing Authority with the change in leadership, said, ``I would
benefit personally, but Indians would be the losers. We must settle
these things ourselves.''
   Chapela argues that the Navajo should adopt a constitution,
allowing them an effective recall process.
   A sampling of private attorneys with experience in Indian law
showed widespread if reluctant sympathy for at least a limited form
of a federal review.
   Richard Hughes, a former Indian legal aid attorney now
practicing in Albuquerque, N.M., said, ``Suppression of political
dissent is the way of life'' with many tribes. ``That kind of
problem is what gives rise to the critical civil rights issues.''
   Attorneys pressing for federal court review complain of
resistance from the Senate Indian Affairs committee and the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, which they allege are interested is preserving
the status quo.
   Some of the attorneys refer to the entrenched posture of the
Senate committee, the BIA and tribal governments as ``the iron
triangle.'' The result, they say, is that Indians suffer at Indian
hands.
   But officials who oppose federal review argue that Indians
should be left alone to run their tribes.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate committee,
repeatedly criticizes what he calls the imposition of unsuccessful
solutions on Indians.
   ``We are convinced that the solutions are in Indian Country,''
he told a group of tribal leaders last fall in Miami. ``It's about
time Indians decided on how to solve their own problems.''

   Carolyn Benally, a Navajo employment
officer, got some action when she complained to a local paper about
favoritism in tribal civil service hiring. She was fired.
   Her lawyer, John Chapela, offers little encouragement for
redress. He is only in private practice because he was dismissed as
head of the Navajo Housing Authority for being, he said, in the
wrong party.
   Civil rights attorneys say the Navajos have perhaps the best of
any tribal court system, but they point to a recent scandal and
allegations of civil rights abuses as evidence that individual
Navajos face discrimination by tribal leaders.
   Chairman Peter MacDonald, who spoke in an interview with charm
and persuasion of his plans to restore Navajo prosperity, denied
any wrongdoing. He has never been indicted, much less convicted.
   But even close associates acknowledge that recent developments
provide cause for raised eyebrows.
   A major scandal is ``Bogate,'' the tribe's purchase of the Big
Boquillas Ranch near Tuba City, Ariz., a year ago.
   Middlemen paid Tenneco West $26.2 million for it. Five minutes
later, the Navajos bought the ranch for $33.4 million.
   MacDonald, in an interview, said the Navajos paid a fair price
and did not know what the intermediary purchasers had paid. A
commission to the middlemen was normal, he said, adding: ``That's
partly how business is done in America.''
   But a principal middleman was an old associate who had raised
money for MacDonald's campaigns. The ranch had been on the market
20 years.
   Shortly after the Tribal Council approved the purchase, Coconino
County records show, MacDonald paid off the loan on his retirement
home.
   The circumstances prompted separate investigations by the
Inspector-General of the Interior Department, the Internal Revenue
Service and the FBI. All are still under way.
   More recently, MacDonald sought to assert tribal control over
the Navajo Education and Scholarship Foundation, regarded as a
sinecure for his arch rival Peterson Zah, the former chairman.
   Zah, locked out of his office, got a court order barring anyone
from evicting him. The tribe found another judge. After a judicial
tug-of-war, police shut down the whole building, leaving 80 other
employees in the street.
   ``The integrity of the Navajo Nation law has been reduced to
this game of musical doorknobs,'' observed Duane Beyal, Zah's
spokesman.
   Shortly after a group of workers marched to MacDonald's office
to ask for alternate quarters, two participants were fired,
although the tribe gave other reasons for their dismissal.
   Dissent has been rare since MacDonald shut down the
independent-minded Navajo Times daily in 1986, expelling editors
before they could produce the next morning's edition. MacDonald
said the tribe-owned paper was losing money.
   Nevertheless, the tribe spends $2 million a year on public
relations firms and Washington lobbyists, MacDonald acknowledged.
   Chapela, who is collecting signatures for a recall that can take
place only with approval from MacDonald's hand-picked council,
said, ``His goal is to bankrupt the Navajo Nation to finance his
gold-plated retirement.''
   Other sources speak to visitors in whispered asides, or through
notes passed at the Navajo Nation Motor Inn, the focal point of
this windswept capital city in northern Arizona.
   But, warned a non-Indian lawyer with long experience on the
reservation, allegations are not proof. ``If MacDonald is a
crook,'' he said, ``he is a smart one.'' To protect himself, the
lawyer insisted on anonymity.

<HEAD>From Rock to Rodeos to Democrats, The Omni Has Seen It All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rusty-looking building the Democrats will
crowd into next week has been home over the years to revivals,
rodeos and rock concerts; tennis, tractor-pulls and title fights;
Springsteen, Sinatra and soccer. And basketball, especially
basketball.
   The Omni arena, which opened in 1972 with a professional hockey
game, was built at a cost of about $17 million on a platform over
land owned by a group of developers who also put together the
adjacent Omni International business-office-hotel complex.
   Since then, the building housing the businesses has been sold to
Ted Turner. He changed the name to CNN Center after his Cable News
Network, which moved into space originally occupied by an indoor
amusement park.
   A Turner-owned company manages the arena, but it remains owned
by a joint city-county authority.
   The arena was constructed mainly to provide a home for the
Atlanta Hawks, a professional basketball team, said former Mayor
Sam Massell. He spearheaded the negotiations with then-Hawks owner
Tom Cousins, who was also the lead developer in the larger complex.
Turner now is majority owner of the Hawks.
   There was ``a thirst for professional sports,'' Massell said,
and a hope that the arena would serve as a catalyst for development
on a neglected side of downtown Atlanta.
   Massell admitted that hasn't happened as rapidly as some
predicted.
   The building's exterior was intentionally designed to rust, to
cut down on maintenance costs.
   Its roofline of 25 pyramid-shaped pods has been compared to an
upside-down egg crate, the configuration designed to provide
external support and to avoid columns inside.
   Indoors, the arena floor runs diagonally, to give more room for
16,237 seats for basketball and to provide space in the corners for
private clubs.
   That space is going to be at a premium for the Democrats since
construction of the podium and of skyboxes for network television
will reduce the seating to about 11,000, forcing off the convention
floor many of the non-delegates accustomed to priority seating in
the past.
   Little controversy has surrounded the building, aside from
periodic griping about concession prices, beer drinking and drug
use at rock concerts.
   As for the unusual name, Massell recalled that as one of the few
controversies 16 years ago.
   He said the name ``came from the dictionary,'' which defines the
Latin-derived prefix ``omni'' as ``all, universal ... without
restriction.'' It's been quite appropriate considering the ice
shows, circuses and conventions staged there year in and year out.
   Massell said the name ``omni'' was unusual when the complex was
built, but the Omni International Hotel was the beginning of what's
become a chain of upscale hotels.

   Atlanta is dressing up for the Democrats with the
hope that the 35,000 visitors to the party's national convention
will take home a rosy impression of the city.
   But the newly-planted flowers along Peachtree Street and the
scrubbed down convention center will be unable to hide the rickety
shanties of Cabbagetown and the thousands of homeless.
   This prosperous heart of the new South has a core city that
ranks as the second-poorest in the nation, and activists estimate
that 7,000 to 10,000 people are homeless. Leaders say they plan to
make their plight known during the convention in July.
   Anita Beatty, co-director of the Atlanta Task Force for the
Homeless, said there are no plans for large marches or
demonstrations during the convention because the impact would be
lost.
   Instead, with representatives of national homeless groups, task
force members will occupy some of the 1,300 empty public housing
units in Atlanta for an undetermined time starting July 14, four
days before the opening gavel.
   ``Who among the Democrats will take action to solve the problem
if the problem is not visible?'' Mrs. Beatty said. ``It's nice to
have 58 facilities to house the homeless, but it is kind of like
letting steam out of the kettle.''
   The coalition plans a ``sanctuary space,'' either in a church or
large tent, where homeless can go and not fear arrest in clean-up
drives. The city also decided some months ago to keep open a
shelter for about 150 men that would have closed at the end of
March and to add three more shelters, each housing about 30 people.
   Statistically, Atlanta is an island of prosperity in the South,
but the numbers for the ``Atlanta area'' say little about the city
proper, which has only about 20 percent of the metropolitan area's
2.2 million residents.
   Suburban Atlanta is composed of large, shaded lots, nice brick
homes, golf courses, shopping malls and white faces. Urban Atlanta
is overwhelmingly black with about 27 percent of the residents
living below the poverty line, second only to Newark, N.J.,
according to U.S. Census figures.
   Fulton County, which includes the city of Atlanta, has an
unemployment rate of 6.2 percent. The average for the four
surrounding metropolitan area counties is 4.3 percent.
   Some of Atlanta's homeless live under a viaduct that runs past
the convention site, within the projected security zone around the
convention area. City officials say the indigents must vacate the
shantytown for security reasons.
   ``I don't see why they're tryin' to hide us. It ain't like we
done nothing wrong. We just ain't got nowhere else to stay,'' said
Charles Prater, 37, one of the group.
   Mrs. Beatty fears that ``some Draconian things are going to be
done.''

<HEAD>Civil Rights Leaders Remember Jackson's Movement Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson and his days in the 1960s civil
rights movement are not topics of easy conversation on the home
ground of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
   Few among the civil rights old guard want to talk about
Jackson's time with King's Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. And those willing to discuss the subject sometimes
paint a less than flattering picture of the man who went on to run
for president.
   King's widow, Coretta Scott King, declined to reminisce publicly
about Jackson, except to say he was the one who told her King had
been shot and instructed her to ``take the next thing smoking'' to
Memphis, Tenn.
   Ralph Abernathy and Andrew Young, King's top aides, did not
return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on Jackson.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, the current SCLC president and a Jackson
supporter, paused for several minutes when asked for movement
memories of the Democratic presidential candidate.
   ``I don't remember nothin','' he said.
   Atlanta City Councilman Hosea Williams, who worked in field
operations for the SCLC, said Jackson's desire to work with King
led to a meteoric rise in the organization and a post running its
Chicago departments.
   ``Jesse was smart, energetic, charismatic; he really impressed
Dr. King,'' Williams said.
   But Jackson also had an obvious disdain for following rules,
Williams said, and would use the funds he raised for his Chicago
operations, without prior approval of SCLC officials.
   King and the rest of the SCLC executive council grew tired of
Jackson's rule-bending, Williams said, and emotions came to a head
in late March 1968. During an Atlanta meeting five days before his
death, King had a heated exchange with Jackson and stormed out of
the room in uncharacteristic anger.
   ``He turned around and looked at Jesse and said, `Jesse, if you
want to start your own national organization, I understand. It's OK
with me. But don't try to destroy me in the interim,''' Williams
said.
   After King's death, Jackson had other rifts with SCLC officials
into the early 1970s, leading him to ``walk away'' from the
organization and never return, Williams said.
   One major source of friction with civil rights leaders was the
bloody shirt incident.
   Jackson created an uproar when, hours after King's
assassination, he appeared in Chicago and on national television,
wearing a bloodstained turtleneck sweater and saying he had cradled
King as he died. Civil rights leaders were outraged.
   ``When I got up there, Abernathy was cradling Doc's head, and
Andy had gone into the room to get a towel,'' Williams said. ``We
got Doc in the car and they headed to the hospital _ Abernathy went
with him.
   ``All at once I heard someone say `I was the last man in the
world King talked to.' I looked around, and it was Jesse. With all
the press around, he said `All this blood on my shirt, I got it
when I cradled his head.'''
   Williams said Jackson was not on the Memphis motel balcony when
the shots were fired. Jackson had been standing in the parking lot
with the chauffeur and the Rev. James Bevel, the SCLC field
strategist who brought Jackson into the organization in 1965.
   Jackson generally declines to talk about the incident, but The
Washington Post quoted him in April as saying, ``It happened the
way I said it did.''
   Later, Williams said, King's aides gathered and pledged their
support to Abernathy, King's best friend, as the new president of
SCLC.
   ``I remember Jesse saying he was sick; he said `I'm going to my
room.' What Jesse did is Jesse went to Chicago,'' Williams said,
describing how King's horrified aides watched as Jackson wore the
blood-smeared sweater on the ``Today'' show and during hearings
before the Chicago City Council.
   ``Some of those like Andy and Coretta and others have never been
able to forgive Jesse for that,'' he said.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who worked with the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee during the 1960s, is less accusatory than
Williams in his comments on Jackson. He said in an interview that
criticism of Jackson's movement activities stem from the fact that
Jackson ``didn't play the politics of the movement.''
   ``I think a great many older people _ and some not so old _ that
were part of the movement felt threatened by Jesse Jackson, by his
leadership, by his ability,'' Lewis said. ``He had some idea about
what direction he wanted to move, and set about doing just that.
   ``He made a very signtion in Chicago to give the
movement a solid presence in a large urban area outside the
South,'' Lewis added. ``I don't think Jesse deliberately went out
on a course to usurp power in the SCLC.''
   Bevel, a staunch Republican who currently works withificant contribu
a Chicago
youth organization he formed, said, ``I brought Jesse Jackson into
SCLC. I recommended Jesse,'' he said. ``There was a struggle within
the organization against the recommendation, but he was set up in
Chicago, to set that operation into motion.
   ``We were in Memphis together when King was shot,'' Bevel said.
``King got shot about 6 o'clock. And Ralph (Abernathy) told me to
go up to the temple to tell the people, because him and Andy and
Bernard Lee were gnature.''
   Lincoln was nominated on the third ballot, won the election over
the divided Democrats and reluctantly appointed Cameron to the
treasury.
   The last convention year in which both major parties opened
their conventions with the outcome uncertain was in 1952.
   Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower beat out Ohio Sen. Robert Taft, the
choice of conservatives, for the GOP nomination on the first ballot.
   The uncertainty was greater on the Democratic side. Eleven
candidates were nominated. The front-runner, Sen. Estes Kefauver of
Tennessee, could muster only 28 percent on the first ballot.
   Democratic kingmakers began to look elsewhere.
   Their eyes fell on Illinois' Democratic governor, Adlai E.
Stevenson, who had delivered a stirring keynote address.
   Stevenson refused to run.
   A draft movement was formed and on the third ballot it succeeded.
   The longest convention in the history of either party was the
Democratic conclave of 1924 in New York.
   There were 103 roll calls over 17 days.
   New York Gov. Al Smith passed William Gibbs McAdoo, secretary of
the treasury in the Woodrow Wilson administration, on the 86th
ballot of the political marathon in a convention divided between
rural and big city elements.
   Humorist Will Rogers complained that New York City had invited
delegates to visit the place, not live there permanently.
   McAdoo recaptured the lead on the 94th but released his
delegates on the 99th.
   Wall Street lawyer John W. Davis, who had received just 31 votes
on the first ballot, finally prevailed on the 103rd and marched off
to defeat by Calvin Coolidge in November.
   It was the Republican convention of 1920 that produced that
classic symbol of a brokered convention, ``the smoke-filled room.''
   There is disagreement on whether there was actually a
smoke-filled room in Chicago where party bosses turned to Sen.
Warren Harding of Ohio.
   But there is no disagreement that the term has entered American
political history as a powerful symbol of a manipulated convention.
   According to the Boller account, Harry M. Daughtery, Harding's
campaign manager, had predicted four months before the convention
that delegates would deadlock and weary party bosses would select
Harding in a hotel room meeting in the early morning hours.
   Actually, Harding was called before Republican leaders at 2:00
a.m., told he might win the nomination the next day, and asked
whether there was anything in his background that might prove
embarrassing or harm his effectiveness as candidate or president.
   Harding was left alone to think about it, then declared there
was ``nothing, no obstacle'' to his candidacy _ a declaration that
might have been less than candid considering Harding's affair at
the time with a married woman.
   After it was all over, according to Boller, someone called
Pennsylvania Sen. Boies Penrose, who had helped orchestrate
Harding's selection, and said he hoped Harding's weakness for women
wouldn't be brought up in the campaign.
   ``No worries about that,'' said Penrose.
   ``We'll just throw a halo around his handsome head and
everything will be all right.''

   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday the charges were
the latest to result from information gathered from Ivan Boesky and
others caught up in the snowballing Wall Street insider trading

Bank of New York Co. in its longstanding effort to acquire the

   Supreme Court Justice Herman Cahn ruled Wednesday that Bank of

warranted against Ashland Oil Inc. in connection with the Jan. 2
fuel tank collapse that polluted two major rivers in three states.
   Gov. Robert Casey, following the recommendations of a task force
report, told the Department of Environmental Resources on Wednesday
to begin seeking maximum civil penalties. He asked the state
attorney general to consider filing criminal charges.

   The nation's grain reserves are large enough
to prevent major shortages for the rest of the year and keep
consumer food prices in check despite the drought, an Agriculture
Department official says.
   However, there could be a squeeze in the supply of soybeans and
oats, according to Ewen M. Wilson, assistant secretary of
agriculture for economics.
   Wilson said Wednesday that 65 percent of the winter wheat crop,
which amounts to three-quarters of all U.S. wheat production,
already has been harvested. Almost two-thirds of the spring wheat
crop is rated in poor condition because of the drought, he said.

   Japan was the only industrial power to best
the United States in reducing manufacturing labor costs in absolute
terms last year, according to a government report.
   Measured in devalued U.S. dollars, labor costs in Japan soared
13.5 percent compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the United
States, the Labor Department reported Wednesday.
   U.S. manufacturers held hourly wage and benefit increases last
year to just 1.3 percent, compared with boosts of 1.4 percent in
Japan, 4.5 percent in Candada, 3.4 percent in France, 4 percent in
West Germany and 8.2 percent in Great Britain.

   World oil prices rose amid reports that
three OPEC members might request an emergency meeting of the cartel
to consider ways of cutting production and propping up prices.
   But analysts remained steadfast in their predictions that the
fractured cartel could do little to forestall continued price
erosion through the summer.
   Prices have dropped sharply over the past month in response to
surplus supplies and a perception among traders that OPEC is
crumbling. The next regular OPEC meeting is set for Nov. 21.

   The Senate voted Wednesday by a veto-proof
72-23 margin to make companies provide workers and local officials
60 days advance notice of plant closings and large layoffs.
   Nineteen Republicans, many of them up for re-election this year,
joined Democrats in support of the mandatory notices, which
President Reagan cited as his primary reason for vetoing in May a
massive overhaul of the nation's trade laws.
   The bill requires employers to provide the advance notices for
any shutdown of an operation involving at least one-third of
plant's workforce and any layoff applying to 50 or more workers.

   Eastern Airlines and its unions have signed an
agreement designed to defuse years of bitter battling and improve
safety procedures at the often-criticized carrier.
   The pact comes a month after federal investigators warned that
safety could be threatened.
   The deal, reached late Tuesday night, spells out procedures for
the company and its 32,500 workers to discuss complaints and
disagreements, but does little to directly address the airline's
ongoing negotiations with its mechanics and pilots, who are working
under expired contracts.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall; Automakers Report Sales Jump</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A selling wave has reversed an advance in the stock market, but
U.S. automakers reported their late June sales strengthened from a
year earlier.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
28.45 points Wednesday to finish at 2,130.16. The loss wiped out a
27.03-point advance on Tuesday that had carried the Dow average and
other widely-followed market indicators to new highs for this year.
   Analysts attributed the drop partly to selling by professionals
engaged in computer-program trading strategies involving
stock-index futures and ``baskets'' of individual stocks.
   The stock market also suffered from renewed inflation worries,
analysts said. Prices of some key farm commodities such as soybeans
jumped late in the session on a forecast of more hot, dry weather
in the Midwest. Oil prices also rose.
   The latest bout of inflation jitters, combined with the weaker
dollar, also dragged down bond prices. The Treasury's closely
watched 30-year bond dropped by $12.50 per $1,000 in face value,
while its yield soared to 8.98 percent from 8.87 percent late
Tuesday.
   In their auto sales reports, Ford Motor Co., General Motors
Corp. and Chrysler Corp. each said their car sales climbed in the
last 10 days of June, and the Big Three automakers all finished the
first half of 1988 ahead of the same period last year.
   Many foreign automakers also reported upturns after a slow start
on the year. Honda and Toyota reported sales increases on both
their domestic and foreign-made cars.
   In other economic developments Wednesday:
   _The Labor Department reported that only Japan among the world's
industrial powers bested the United States in reducing
manufacturing labor costs in absolute terms last year. But measured
in devalued dollars, labor costs in Japan soared 13.5 percent
compared with a 1.5 percent decline in the United States, which had
lower hourly increases in wages and benefits than any of its nine
largest industrial competitors.
   _Fears of higher interest rates and rising inflation weakened
consumer buying plans in June as confidence in the U.S. economy
slipped from an 18-year high in May, according to a survey by the
Conference Board.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Rise on Technical Factors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures traders generally have disregarded a
report that three OPEC members were calling for an emergency
meeting of the cartel, but prices still rose on technical factors.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for August
delivery of West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 27 cents
higher at $15.36 per barrel Wednesay after picking up 15 cents on
Tuesday.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
closed up 0.84 cent to 50.56 cents a gallon and home heating oil
advanced 1.02 cents to 42.61 cents a gallon.
   Most traders gave little weight to a Kuwait News Agency report
that three members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries might request an emergency meeting of the cartel, said
Madison Galbraith, senior energy specialist for Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures.
   The Kuwaiti news agency, citing high-level senior industry
sources, said officials from Venezuela, Algeria and Ecuador wanted
OPEC to consider ways of cutting production and propping up prices.
   Some traders were concerned about the report and the possibility
of higher prices, but Wednesday's gains were the result of ``just
another short-covering rally,'' Galbraith said.
   In a short trade, an investor sells borrowed contracts in hope
of replacing them later with contracts bought at lower prices. In
such cases, a price rise can cause a flurry of buying as traders
try to cover their positions.
   Galbraith called the advance a correction of an oversold market,
and said the underlying market fundamentals remained bearish.
   At its meeting last month, OPEC oil ministers failed to settle
their internal problems and simply left the existing system of
production quotas and prices unchanged.
   But that system was, and still is, in disarray. Most OPEC
members are producing above their individual quotas or discounting
their prices.
   Some estimates put OPEC production at 3.5 million barrels above
the group's self-imposed overall ceiling of 15.06 million barrels a
day.

   The New York Stock Exchange, trying to appease
big brokers and small investors, is abandoning a post-crash limit
on computerized program trading while considering a plan to give
individuals speedier access to the market.
   Directors of the nation's biggest securities market were
discussing the changes at their regularly scheduled meeting today,
said sources familiar with the Big Board's plans who spoke on
condition they not be identified.
   Scrapping the so-called ``collar'' restraint on high-volume
computerized program trades would end one of the most controversial
confidence-boosting revisions undertaken by NYSE in the aftermath
of the October crash.
   The sources said there was widespread thinking, especially among
large brokerages which utilize program trading, that the collar no
longer was needed because the market has been relatively stable in
recent weeks.
   The other measure, which the sources likened to a rush-hour
``express lane'' for individual investors, is designed to counter a
perception that the NYSE ignores small trading orders in favor of
the larger and more profitable transactions from big brokers and
their institutional clients.
   NYSE spokeswoman Sharon Gamsin said she could not comment on
matters before the board. But she said the collar limitation,
implemented in February, never was meant to be permanent.
   Trading professionals gave mixed reactions to the collar news.
Some called the limit useless, but others said it played a valuable
role in calming the wild price swings that frightened away
investors during and after the crash.
   Under the collar, the NYSE banned use of its order system for a
popular form of computerized program trading called index arbitrage
on days when the Dow Jones industrial average rose or fell at least
50 points from the previous close.
   ``If they take the rule off, I think there will be more
volatility,'' said David Johnson, president and chief executive of
Johnson, Lane, Space, Smith & Co., a brokerage in Savannah, Ga.
``That means there will be less inclination for the individual to
participate in this market.''
   Robert Kirby, head of Capital Guardian Trust Co. in Los Angeles
and an outspoken critic of index arbitrage, said he thought the
collar had helped curb computer-armed speculators from rampantly
trading stocks to capture short-term profits regardless of
underlying values.
   ``Investors are being flushed out of the system by a bunch of
Star Wars guys,'' Kirby said. ``Markets are going to go where they
go, but I'd like to see them driven by investors, not computers.''
   The individual-investor proposal before the NYSE board also got
a mixed reaction, with some calling it a confidence builder and
others discounting it as a symbolic gesture.
   Under this proposal, individuals placing orders of less than
1,000 shares would have a special computerized ``express lane'' to
the NYSE floor on days when the Dow average swung more than 25
points from the previous close.
   During the crash, many small investors complained they could not
get their sell orders to the NYSE floor quickly because of the
congestion caused by large institutional orders. This meant
individuals were forced to sell at much lower prices, while larger
investors were able to sell first.
   ``I think the individual should have equal access,'' said John
Bachmann, chairman of the Securities Industry Association and
managing partner of Edward D. Jones & Co., a St. Louis-based
brokerage. ``Anybody who thinks the individual had equal access
last time (during the crash) were wrong.''
   But John Markese, vice president of the American Association for
Individual Investors in Chicago, said he was not sure such a
proposal would help small stockholders.
   ``It's holding out a hand,'' he said. ``It's going in the right
direction, but it may prove to be a token gesture.''

<HEAD>NY State Judge Throws Out Irving Poison Pill Provision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Irving Bank Corp. has vowed to appeal a state
court ruling striking down a provision of its ``poison pill''
defense aimed at thwarting Bank of New York's hostile merger
efforts.
   Supreme Court Justice Herman Cahn on Wednesday granted a
preliminary injunction against the provision, ruling it unfairly
discriminated against Bank of New York and the company would suffer
``irreparable harm'' from Irving's takeover defense.
   The defense would allow all of Irving shareholders _ except a
hostile suitor _ to buy $400 worth of Irving shares for $200 if any
suitor bought more than 20 percent of Irving stock without the
support of Irving's management. Such provisions are intended to
make unsolicited takeover bids prohibitively expensive.
   Irving attorney Robert A. Falise said the bank planned to appeal
Cahn's ruling, which he called ``erroneous.''
   But Falise said he was pleased the judge did not reject Irving's
entire poison pill, which adheres to a New York state anti-takeover
law that prevents an unfriendly merger for at least five years.
   Bank of New York reaffirmed its outstanding buyout offer and
said it would seek a 60-day extension from the Federal Reserve
Board for conditional approval of its proposed merger with Irving.
The Fed's approval was due to run out Saturday.
   Rodgin Cohen, an attorney for Bank of New York, said Cahn's
ruling ``should remove the single biggest question they (the Fed)
had, and that was the ability to complete the merger.''
   Mark Alpert, a banking analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co.,
predicted the Fed would grant an extension. ``If the Fed had wanted
to stop this (the takeover battle), they would have spoken up now.''
   Alpert said it was unlikely Bank of New York would attempt to
amass a larger stake in Irving for fear that Irving would win an
appeal that would trigger the poison pill.
   He also noted that even if an appeals court ruled in favor of
Bank of New York the state anti-takeover law would force Bank of
New York to operate Irving as a separate subsidiary.
   Cahn's decision came a day after Irving's board of directors
accepted an improved merger offer from a friendly suitor, state-run
Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second largest bank.
   The Milan-based bank offered Tuesday to sweeten its bid for a 51
percent stake of Irving with warrants entitling shareholders to buy
newly issued Irving stock at $65 a share over the next seven years.
Stockholders would receive one warrant for every four shares they
currently owned.
   The offer was contingent upon Irving keeping its poison pill
intact.
   Banca Commerciale previously had offered $80 a share for 51
percent of Irving's 18.5 million common shares outstanding, or
about $760 million. The blended value was as much as $76.50 per
share.
   The merger proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring
plan that includes, among other things, sale of Irving assets,
cost-cutting measures and a special cash dividend.
   Irving said the latest offer made the overall transaction worth
at least $79.50 per share, which the bank's board deemed superior
to Bank of New York's ``best and final bid.''
   However, estimates of the value of the offer have differed
widely.
   Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of
Irving's common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around
$68 a share or $1.2 billion.
   The bank had offered to sweeten the rare hostile bid by slightly
raising the stock portion of the bid and adding other shareholder
incentives, including a special cash dividend, if Irving agreed to
abandon its poison pill.

<HEAD>Samurai Sales Off 70.2 Percent in June From Year Earlier</HEAD>

   The Suzuki Samurai collided head-on with bad
publicity in June as allegations that it was prone to roll over
contributed to a 70.6 percent drop in sales from a year earlier.
   Consumers Union, the group that blasted the Samurai, said the
drop was a ``good sign'' if it was the result of the group's report
alleging that the boxy, jeep-like vehicle was dangerous in certain
situations.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp. said Wednesday it sold 2,199
Samurais in June, the least since December 1985, which was the
month after the vehicle's U.S. introduction.
   Suzuki sold 7,479 Samurais in June 1987 and 6,074 in May of this
year, when concerns about the Suzuki already had begun to spread
through the buying public.
   Suzuki has maintained the Consumers Union tests were biased and
inaccurate, but dealers said potential buyers were unnerved by
dramatic television news clips of the vehicle tilting over during
driving tests.
   Suzuki said it was not surprised by the decline, expected sales
to increase in coming months, and remained absolutely confident of
the Samurai's safety.
   Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports
magazine, has said Suzuki should recall the vehicle and give
refunds to owners.
   Asked for comment on the sales figures, Consumers Union
spokesman David Berliner said, ``If it is a reflection in any way
of the public giving credence to our findings, then I think that is
a good sign.''
   Consumers Union said June 2 that the Samurai tends to roll over
when the driver swerves sharply back and forth to avoid an
accident. The Mount Vernon, N.Y.-based group gave the vehicle its
first ``not acceptable'' rating in 10 years.
   Suzuki is not planning on withdrawing the Samurai from the
market in response to the poor June sales, said Rob Cahn, a
representative of the company's public relations agency, Rogers &
Associates. He said that has been the company's position from the
beginning.
   For the first six months of 1988, Samurai sales were down to
31,221 from 42,912 a year earlier, according to American Suzuki,
the Brea, Calif.-based subsidiary of Japan's Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd.
   ``It's impossible to tell whether Samurai can pull out of this
or not,'' said Ronald Glanz, an analyst for Montgomery Securities
Inc. in San Francisco, who said the vehicle's reputation already
was in question before the Consumers Union report.
   ``I think Suzuki will keep protesting that the product is safe
and then shift production over to the Sidekick,'' a bigger, more
stable vehicle that is scheduled to be introduced next spring,
Glanz said.
   The Samurai, a four-wheel-drive vehicle, has a high center of
gravity, a narrow tread width, a short wheelbase and relatively
light weight. Consumers Union said that combination made the
vehicle inherently flawed, but Suzuki said the design was sound and
cited statistics showing the Samurai had a good safety record.
   The Samurai passed the ordinary Consumers Union test. It flunked
only when the consumer organization altered the obstacle course to
make it more challenging.
   The Samurai gained a reputation as a fun car, popular with young
people, and became a best-seller almost immediately after its
introduction in the United States. It took some business away from
larger and more expensive cousins, such as the Jeep Wrangler, Jeep
Cherokee and Isuzu Trooper II.
   But sales already had begun to slow down from their torrid 1987
pace earlier this year, partly because of allegations by the Center
for Auto Safety about the Samurai's propensity to roll over.
   Sales of the Jeep Wrangler, the Samurai's closest competitor,
jumped 46 percent to 4,848 in June from 3,318 in June 1987. The
Wrangler's sales were up 8.5 percent from 4,469 in May of this year.

<HEAD>Labor-Management Safety Agreement Received Coolly</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines unions and management are not
ready to declare peace is at hand, despite an agreement to separate
safety issues from their other disputes.
   ``The key word to use is `guardedly' optimistic because there's
been such an extended period of mistrust,'' said J.B. Stokes, a
spokesman for the Eastern local of the Air Line Pilots Association,
which represents 3,500 pilots. ``You have to be somewhat cautious.''
   The pact announced Wednesday comes a month after federal
investigators warned that safety could be threatened at
financially-troubled Eastern, the nation's sixth-largest airline,
if its labor problems were not resolved quickly.
   The deal spells out procedures for the company and its 32,500
workers to discuss complaints and disagreements.
   ``We are optimistic and hopeful this will represent a
breakthrough in relations,'' said Charles E. Bryan, district
president of the Machinists union, Eastern's largest labor group
with 12,000 members. ``We don't think this is going to be a total
cure for all the problems of Eastern.''
   Judy Coughlin, secretary-treasurer of the Transport Workers
Union local, representing 7,000 Eastern flight attendants, said her
union was skeptical of the deal but supported any attempt to
improve safety.
   ``We're willing to cooperate on anything, but the problems are
not going to be solved until our people can go to work and not
worry about being fired,'' she said.
   Robin Matell, a company spokesman, said Eastern would not
characterize the agreement beyond a statement by President Phil
Bakes, who said the pact would keep safety out of collective
bargaining issues. But Bakes also noted it was essential to
complete negotiations on economic issues with the machinists and
pilots unions.
   Former Labor Secretary William E. Brock, chosen by federal
officials June 2 to find ways to ease Eastern's labor-management
relations, said he found ``tensions were accelerated to an
unbelievable level'' between the two sides.
   Years of disputes, including lawsuits, lobbying in Congress and
negative newspaper advertisements, have made passengers afraid to
fly Eastern and had created a situation where the airline is losing
$1 million daily, Brock said.
   Transportation Secretary James H. Burnley IV called the
agreement ``a good beginning'' and said federal inspectors would
continue stepped-up monitoring of Eastern ``to assure the flying
public that it remains a safe, fit airline.''
   Rank-and-file reaction to the safety agreement seemed mixed as
reports reached Eastern employees in its Miami base.
   A mechanic fired 18 months ago said he was skeptical about how
well the deal would ease tensions.
   ``There have been so many things done to people and their
families, it would be awfully hard to forgive and forget,'' said
the mechanic, who asked that his name not be used because his case
is in federal arbitration.
   A flight attendant arriving at Miami International Airport said
she found it encouraging that ``some agreement, any agreement was
made. You have to start somewhere,'' said the woman, who like many
Eastern employees asked that her name not be used.
   The pact calls for the establishment of a master safety
committee consisting of top company and union officials, which will
help resolve safety problems pointed out by employees.
   Panels will be established throughout the country at which local
managers and union leaders will attempt to resolve issues such as
captains' authority, the handling of calls to the company's
complaint lines, training of maintenance workers and a study of
workplace injuries.
   ``The document is worthless if there is not compliance,'' Bryan
told reporters. ``We have a collective bargaining agreement (which)
has been blatantly violated consistently by this management. So
there was some reservation about putting a lot of confidence in
this document.''
   A measure of the continued mistrust was the inability to get
management and union leaders to appear together at the Washington
news conference.
   Eastern has been marked by labor-management conflicts for more
than a decade, as a period of cooperation under former Chairman
Frank Borman deteriorated and led to the money-losing airline's
sale in 1986 to Houston-based Texas Air Corp.
   Texas Air's management led by Chairman Frank Lorenzo heightened
tensions by saying Eastern had to cut its labor costs by up to 30
percent. Eastern lost $241 million last year, and Texas Air lost
$466 million.
   The Machinists, in federal mediation with management since
January, have refused to take wage concessions of up to 50 percent
for some non-mechanics, such as baggage handlers. Eastern says it
can't reverse its losses without the concessions.
   A group of Eastern pilots testified before Congress last year
that they were pressured repeatedly to fly aircraft they considered
unsafe. The agreement pledges that, ``No employee will be harassed,
threatened or disciplined for reporting or causing to report an
unsafe condition on an aircraft.''
   Federal officials conducted special inspections of aircraft
flown by Eastern and Continental last spring and also examined
Texas Air's management and finances. They announced they had not
found unsafe conditions but warned of possible safety problems
because of the labor-management battles.
   The Federal Aviation Administration in April proposed an
$823,000 fine against Eastern for recordkeeping and maintenance
infractions. Fourteen months earlier, the airline had agreed to pay
a record $9.5 million penalty.

   Federal prosecutors say information gathered
from Ivan Boesky and others caught up in the snowballing Wall
Street insider trading scandal led indirectly to unprecedented
stock manipulation charges against GAF Corp.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and the corporation's vice chairman were
indicted on numerous securities law charges Wednesday for an
alleged scheme to manipulate the price of Union Carbide Corp.
common stock.
   GAF made an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for Union Carbide
in 1985 and kept alive the threat of another attempt until it sold
much of its Carbide stake in late 1986.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said the indictment marked the
first time ``a corporate entity was charged with stock
manipulation'' in the government's widening probe.
   The 10-count indictment charged GAF, two subsidiaries _ GAF
Chemicals Corp. and Jay & Company Inc. _ and James T. Sherwin,
GAF's vice chairman and chief administrative officer with
conspiracy, stock price manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud,
causing the creation of false brokerage records and obtaining
improper margin loans to finance stock purchases.
   A spokesman for GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and building
products conglomerate, said the board of directors had expressed
its full confidence in Sherwin as well as ``its deep disappointment
in the government's decision to bring these unprecedented charges.''
   The spokesman said the company and Sherwin intended to defend
themselves vigorously against the charges and were ``confident of
complete vindication.''
   The indictment alleged the stock price manipulation was
conducted through the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm of Jefferies
& Co., which was not charged with any wrongdoing.
   The company's founder, Boyd L. Jefferies, has been cooperating
with investigators and pleaded guilty in March 1987 to two felony
charges arising from the Boesky insider trading scandal.
   Jefferies, who faces a maximum 10-year prison term, has yet to
be sentenced.
   ``Ivan Boesky's connection to this matter is indirect,'' said
Giuliani. ``Boesky cooperated and as a result of his cooperation we
were able to develop a case on Jefferies. Jefferies cooperated and
among other things he revealed this particular situation.''
   Giuliani said Jefferies' cooperation and the investigation were
continuing. He declined to say if additional indictments were in
the works.
   The GAF indictment alleged that Sherwin, acting for GAF, had two
unidentified Jefferies & Co. employees make Union Carbide stock
close at or above a specified price over several days in late
October 1986.
   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson Jr., the
indictment charged Sherwin with plotting to drive up the price of
Union Carbide's stock ``to attract buyers and to maximize the
profits'' GAF could earn by selling its Carbide stock.
   The indictment further alleged that Sherwin promised GAF would
pay Jefferies & Co. for any losses the brokerage incurred on such
trades. At the time, GAF owned nearly 10 million shares, or 10
percent of Carbide's outstanding common shares.
   Jefferies & Co. bought large amounts of Carbide stock _ and lost
money _ near the close of trading on Oct. 29 and 30, 1986. The
indictment contended that boosted the price of Carbide common stock.
   The indictment said one of Sherwin's alleged co-conspirators at
Jefferies sent him a $40,000 invoice for fictitious advisory
services. Sherwin allegedly approved payment of the invoice, and
GAF made out a check payable to Jefferies & Co.
   On Nov. 10, 1986, GAF sold 5 million shares of Carbide stock to
Salomon Brothers for nearly $115 million. Giuliani said Salomon
Brothers cooperated with investigators.
   According to the indictment, Sherwin never sent the $40,000 GAF
check to Jefferies. After the news media reported that Boyd
Jefferies, chairman of the brokerage, had been subpoenaed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission in the Boesky investigation,
Sherwin allegedly instructed his secretary to void the $40,000
check.
   If convicted on all counts, Sherwin, 54, of Princeton, N.J.,
faces a maximum 50 years in prison and up to $2.5 million in fines.
The charges against corporate defendant carry maximum fines of up
to $5 million each.

<HEAD>Atlanta Fed Researchers Say Huge Fees Worth The Price In Big
Mergers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of the fees paid to investment bankers in
friendly business mergers concludes that such payments, which may
total millions of dollars, are no more excessive than the
transaction fees paid to real estate agents.
   Researchers William Curt Hunter and Mary Beth Walker of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta stated their review of 125 friendly
mergers between 1979 and 1985 indicated ``the bankers' fees, though
large in absolute terms, are only a small percentage of the
economic value created by the mergers.''
   ``On average, when measured against the gain that the merger
creates for the new entity, ...the fee approximates that of a
typical real estate transaction,'' said the researchers, who
figured the average fee equalled about 6.6 percent of the economic
gain created by the mergers.
   Furthermore, the investment bankers' fees averaged a ``very
reasonable'' less than 1 percent of the total transaction price,
with the highest being 3.4 percent of the price, Hunter said.
   The study was published in the Atlanta Fed's Economic Review
publication.
   The researchers limited their survey to friendly mergers of
public companies and did not look at those where investment banks
provided only fairness or underwriting services. Walker said it was
the first survey to compare fees with services rendered.
   The mergers ranged in value from $34 million to $6 billion, with
fees ranging from $100,000 to $20 million.
   The two largest fees came from the $2.8 billion deal in 1984
that joined Beatrice Foods Co. and Esmark Inc. and the $5 billion
merger in 1985 of Allied Corp with the Signal Cos. Inc.
   Hunter said each deal paid $20 million to the investment banks
involved _ First Boston Corp. and Lazard Freres and Co. in
Beatrice-Esmark; Lazard, Salomon Brothers and Oppenheimer and Co.
in the Allied-Signal merger.
   The wave of mergers and acquisitions in recent years has brought
more attention to the fees paid investment bankers, with some
critics claiming the fees are excessive.
   Trade publications have discussed the fees in articles with
titles like ``Merger Fees That Bend the Mind'' and ``Wall Street's
Overpaid Young Stars.'' The merger departments of three separate
Wall Street firms each earned $200 million in 1985.
   Hunter said the attention and worry have caused some
merger-minded companies to consider a do-it-yourself approach.
   But Hunter and Ms. Walker argued against bypassing the
investment bankers.
   ``Bringing together of buyer and seller and advising on what
price to pay _ from that point of view, (investment bankers) seem
to be well worth their fee,'' Hunter said in an interview.
   ``Firms contemplating a do-it-yourself approach simply because
fees charged by professional merger intermediaries appear excessive
would do well to scrutinize the costs and benefits of
self-search,'' Hunter and Ms. Walker wrote.
   The researchers note that investment banks traditionally have
provided a range of services, including underwriting, market-making
and advice on capital structure, dividend policy, mergers,
acquisitions and divestitures.
   ``While other financial institutions provide many of these same
services, the investment banks' specialization and expertise in
corporate financial matters, along with their position overlooking
capital markets as a whole, give them a comparative advantage that
permits them to command handsome fees,'' they wrote.
   Hunter also said investment bankers are constantly gathering and
assessing information on corporate assets, research that would have
to be done otherwise by individual suitors.

<HEAD>Domestic And Imported Auto Makers Report Late June Sales Increases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Car shoppers in a healthy economy, lured by
sophisticated incentive programs, are likely to keep on buying at
the higher-than-expected rates of the first half of the year,
industry analysts say.
   The big three domestic automakers on Wednesday reported a jump
in their sales rates during the June 21-30 sales period.
   Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 459,918
during the late-June period this year, against 359,784 in the same
period last yera, a jump of 13.6 percent in daily sales rate.
   The late-June period had nine selling days this year and eight
in 1987, so percentage comparisons are made on the basis of daily
sales rates rather than total sales.
   Combined domestic car and light truck sales totaled 1,120,962
for all of June, an 8.5 percent increase in daily sales, and
6,184,576 for the year through June 30, up 11 percent from the
first half of 1987.
   ``We see sales for the rest of the year as pretty good, with a
possible soft spot in October,'' said Thomas O'Grady, an analyst
with Integrated Automotive Resources Inc. in Wayne, Pa.
   A late-year lull might occur as buyers wait to see what
incentives will be offered on newly introduced 1989 models in
dealers' showrooms, he said.
   Among imports, car and light truck sales totaled 333,066 for the
month, down 7.6 percent, and 1,874,004 for the first half, down 1.5
percent.
   For the June 21-30 sales period, Ford Motor Co. sold 89,927
cars, a 27.4 percent jump in daily sales. For the year through June
30, Ford sold 1,161,574 cars, a 12.8 percent increase over the
first half of 1987.
   General Motors sold 144,205 cars in late June, an 18 percent
jump, and 1,952,402 for the first six months, a 4.9 percent
increase.
   Chrysler Corp. sold 40,817 cars in late June, up 8.4 percent a
day, and 574,609 for the first half of 1988, up 14.3 percent.
   O'Grady said sales were helped by the apparent success of new
models at some automakers, such as General Motors GM-10 models. He
also said sales were helped by U.S. automakers' increasing
adeptness at offering incentives, with shorter programs and more
frequent changes in affected models, smoothing sales peaks and
valleys the programs once triggered.
   ``The combination of record employment and a need to replace old
vehicles gave the industry a good start this year,'' Ford vice
president Robert L. Rewey said.
   Honda sold 30,049 domestically made cars and 33,279 imports in
June, up from 25,015 U.S. made cars and 31,078 imports last June.
Toyota sales of U.S.-produced cars for the month reached 3,066, up
from 1,228, and its imports rose to 54,906 from 47,584 last June.
   Nissan sold 49,957 U.S. produced cars in the first half of the
year, down 23.4 percent, and 24,644 imported cars, down 67.3
percent.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for June 21-30.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight last
year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Volkswagen, Honda,
Nissan, Toyota and Mazda are counted as domestic and appear in this
table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Gillette Issued Misleading Reports On Proxy Rival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. inaccurately portrayed a New
York-based partnership during a proxy battle earlier this year but
did not mislead shareholders by withholding information about
potential buyers, says a federal judge.
   U.S. District Court Judge Mark L. Wolf issued his ruling
Wednesday but withheld a decision on whether to invalidate an April
shareholder vote that defeated a dissident slate of directors
nominated by the investment group Coniston Partners.
   The judge postponed that decision until after further testimony
by Gillette on alleged proxy violations by Coniston.
   In a prepared statement, Gillette said it was ``surprised and
disappointed'' by the ruling on the advertisements.
   ``While Gillette disagrees with (the) ruling and believes its
conduct was proper, its immediate efforts will be directed
vigorously toward the further critical issues in the case relating
to Coniston's conduct,'' the statement said.
   Coniston principals were not in their New York offices when
called for comment Wednesday.
   During the trial, which began June 20, both sides alleged
violations and misrepresentations occurred during their nearly
three-month proxy battle over four seats on the Gillette board of
directors.
   Wolf ruled that several newspaper advertisements by Gillette
during the proxy solicition contained ``falsely misleading''
information about Coniston. But Wolf said he still was reviewing
whether Coniston violated full disclosure laws in its filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   He also ruled that Gillette was not required to provide
stockholders with names of companies interested in acquiring the
Boston-based company, including Ralston Purina Co. and Anheuser
Busch Co.
   At least 10 companies have signed agreements not to seek control
of Gillette without first notifying Gillette management, according
to court testimony. Most of the pacts expire in November.
   Gillette on April 14 filed suit seeking to block Coniston's
proxy bid on the grounds Coniston falsified SEC filings and did not
fully acknowledge all of its investors, including Swiss finacier
Tito Tettamanti.
   Judge Rya Zobel allowed the suit but rejected the bid for the
temporary injunction.
   A countersuit by Coniston filed on April 19 alleged Gillette
misrepresented Coniston in advertisements and mailings to the
company's 27,000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose the
companies that had expressed interest in buying Gillette.
   Gillette shareholders rejected the dissident Coniston slate by a
52 percent to 48 percent vote during the April 21 annual meeting.
The candidates _ Coniston partners Augustus K. Oliver, Paul E.
Tierney Jr., Keith R. Gollust and cable television executive David
Strassler _ had indicated they would urge the 12-member Gillette
board to sell the company.
   Two Coniston subsidiaries own 6.76 million Gillette shares, or
about 5.8 percent of the shares outstanding.
   Zobel withdrew from the case June 11 on the grounds that she and
Gillette Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Colman Mockler are
affiliated with Harvard University.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A last-minute competing proposal for the
recapitalization of a financially troubled bank holding company has
delayed federal regulators' decision on the institution's fate,
according to published reports.
   The Dallas Morning News and Dallas Times Herald each reported
Thursday that sources told them Citicorp, the nation's largest bank
holding company, has submitted a preliminary proposal for acquiring
and reorganizing the troubled Texas banking company, First
RepublicBank Corp.
   The Morning News said a spokesman for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said the agency's board was unlikely to strike a
deal Friday, as had been predicted by Albert V. Casey, First
RepublicBank chairman.
   ``I imagine it would be unfruitful to wait for an announcement
this week,'' said Steve Katsanos, FDIC spokesman.
   Citicorp officials had reportedly said Wednesday that they were
looking at First RepublicBank's situation. First RepublicBank's
management last week submitted a bid that would keep the company
independent.
   Citicorp Chairman John Reed told a Washington news conference
that ``we are expressing an interest'' in First RepublicBank but
that ``the next step is up to the FDIC.''
   Neither he nor Citicorp officials would comment further on the
plan.
   Last week, a 20-member team from Citicorp conducted a four-day
inspection of First RepublicBank.
   Last March, First RepublicBank approached the FDIC for a federal
bailout after rising losses from problem loans and large
withdrawals of deposits. The Federal Reserve Bank and the FDIC have
pumped billions of dollars into member banks of the state's largest
such holding company.
   First Republic reported a $1.5 billion loss in the first
quarter. Casey has predicted the institution would suffer another
substantial loss in the second quarter.
   Citicorp is the largest bank holding company in the nation with
$203 billion of assets on March 31. First Republic had assets of
$28.4 billion on March 31.

   Prices on the London Stock Exchange finished lower
Thursday, as price weakness on Wall Street spilled over into the
London market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 14.5
points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,855.5 after trading below Wednesday's
closing level throughout the session.
   Trading volume was 419.9 million shares, compared with 500.2
million shares traded on Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average opened 4 points lower Thursday
in New York after losing 28.45 points in the previous session.
   Market players in London were relieved for most of the afternoon
that New York prices did not slide further.
   But prices on Wall Street retreated late in the London trading
day, and the Dow Jones industrial average was off 21.16 points at
2,109.00 by the time trading ended in London.
   ``We're getting bashed by the dominating (Wall) Street,'' one
equity salesman said. ``And we're not doing a very good job of
fending them off.''
   Several London market watchers said dealings were extremely
listless for most of the day. ``It's just a torpid market,'' one
equity salesman said.

<TEXT>
   The pace of new hiring slowed during May as the
steady improvement in labor conditions leveled off, a research
group said Thursday.
   The Conference Board, a business-financed research organization,
said its help-wanted advertising index edged up three points in May
to 160. The index measures the monthly volume of classified
advertising in 51 major newspapers in the United States.
   The group said such advertising increased moderately in all
sections of the country, except for Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma,
which saw a 4.1 percent decline. Elsewhere, the gains ranged from
6.5 percent in the New York-Pennsylvania area to 0.5 percent in the
Nebraska, Minnesota and Missouri region.
   Job growth in the second half of the year is expected to lag
behind the first half of 1988, the Conference Board said.
   ``This should be good news for those still concerned about the
economy overheating and setting off inflation sparks,'' said
Kenneth Goldstein, an economist for the organization.
   With the latest employment data showing little change, new
hiring is unlikely to rise sharply in the next few months,
Goldstein said. May's 5.6 percent unemployment rate matched the
March level.
   ``All of this suggests that the long, steady improvement in
labor market conditions has run its course,'' he said.

   Stock prices headed lower today in a carryover
of selling from Wednesday's drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 28.45 points on
Wednesday, lost another 12.63 to 2,117.53 by 2 p.m. today on Wall

   After law school, Biaggi worked for Republican Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, but was bounced from a post as assistant secretary of
state in 1965 after refusing an order to take unpaid leave instead
of vacation to work on the mayoral campaign of Abraham Beame.
(Beame lost that race to John Lindsay.)
   In 1968, Biaggi was elected to Congress to fill the seat of
Republican Paul Fino, who had been appointed a judge. He has been
re-elected every two years, with overwhelming majorities; he became
known as a law-and-order Democrat, an advocate of hand-gun control
and an opponent of British rule in Northern Ireland.
   But one office always eluded him: he desperately wanted to be
elected mayor of New York City.
   Why did he want to be mayor?
   ``Why do people climb the Himalayas?'' he replied.
   In 1972, he made a run for the job and looked to be a shoo-in
for the Democratic nomination, which in New York City is tantamount
to election. But Biaggi's candidacy was destroyed by a series of
investigations and allegations, which culminated in his being
proven a liar.
   At the time, Biaggi was questioned by a grand jury looking into
allegations of payoffs to congressmen who sponsored certain
immigration legislation. When reports surfaced that Biaggi had
taken the Fifth Amendment before the panel, he vehemently denied it.
   He sued to have some, but not all, of the record made public.
But the tactic backfired when the judge released all the minutes,
proving Biaggi had in fact asserted his right to not to incriminate
himself.
   Beame was elected mayor and Biaggi went back to Congress.
   In 1986, new accusations were leveled at Biaggi and these began
to stick.
   First, he was indicted for illegally accepting paid vacations in
exchange for using his influence to steer federal contracts to
Coastal Dry Dock and Repair, a Brooklyn shipyard. He was convicted
of taking a gratuity, illegal interstate travel and obstruction.
But he wept when he was sentenced to 2{ years in prison and fined
$500,000. Biaggi is appealing the decision.
   A second indictment accused him of using the Wedtech Corp., a
Bronx-based machine company, as a racketeering enterprise. The case
is now on trial in New York and Biaggi is charged with accepting
millions of dollars' worth of company stock, issued in his son's
name, in exchange for helping the company get military contracts.
His son and four others are on trial with Biaggi.
   The House of Representatives forced Biaggi to relinquish his
subcommittee chairmanships after the first indictment last year and
to refrain from voting after his conviction in September, but those
moves were slaps on the wrist compared to what was to come.
   In February, the House Committee on Standards of Official
Conduct recommended that Biaggi be expelled for ``criminal conduct
... going to the heart of his representational responsibilities.''
In an unusual maneuver, however, congressional leaders decided to
delay action while Biaggi defended himself in the Wedtech trial in
New York.
   It is unclear when the resolution may be brought up, but Biaggi
has resolved to fight it. It must pass by a two-thirds vote of the
House. Asked what his defense would be, he said simply, ``Truth.''
   Biaggi has not denied taking the two vacations to a Florida spa,
which were paid for by former Brooklyn Democratic boss Meade
Esposito.
   ``He's a friend of 40 years,'' Biaggi said. ``It boggles the
mind.''
   At the time, however, Coastal owed Esposito's insurance company
$280,000 in premiums. Esposito was himself convicted of paying
illegal gratuities and given a two-year suspended prison term and a
maximum fine of $500,000.
   Biaggi compared his situation to that of former U.S. Labor
Secretary Raymond Donovan, the first sitting Cabinet member to be
indicted. Donovan was acquitted in May 1987 of larceny and fraud
charges that forced him from office in 1985.
   Biaggi, however, was convicted. Still, he bristled at
comparisons to Rep. Michael ``Ozzie'' Myers, D-Pa., the last
congressman to be expelled. Myers, ousted in 1980, was convicted of
bribery after being videotaped taking $50,000 in the Abscam sting.
   ``I don't think the case is comparable,'' Biaggi said. ``His was
for bribery. You're talking about a gratuity.''
   Despite his legal woes and editorials urging him to resign,
Biaggi said he is ``absolutely'' running for an 11th term.
   As a convicted felon, however, he won't even be able to cast a
vote for himself.

<HEAD>Airlines Step Up Security in Wake of Persian Gulf Incident</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big U.S. airlines that fly overseas say they
are taking no chances with retaliation from terrorists and have
stepped up their defenses in response to the U.S. Navy's downing of
an Iran Air jetliner.
   ``We take the threat seriously,'' said Stephen Heckscher, a
spokesman in London for Trans World Airlines' international
division.
   The incident in the Persian Gulf last weekend, which killed
nearly 300 civilians, has raised fears of a retaliatory attack by
Iran.
   Political experts have suggested that revenge could take the
form of a terrorist assault against U.S. military bases or
personnel overseas, or against other American targets _ including
commercial airline flights.
   Bob Kierce, TWA's director of international security, said the
airline has taken steps to ensure that its already tight security
precautions ``are being exercised to the fullest.''
   Kierce said the airline also has added some new measures at
several airports, which he declined to name. Those measures include
having a senior member of management on duty whenever a TWA plane
is on the ground at those locations.
   TWA, the nation's seventh-largest airline, has been the target
of some of the most notorious terrorist attacks against jetliners
in recent years. In June 1985, Lebanese Shiite Moslems hijacked a
TWA flight over the Mediterranean and diverted it to Beirut, where
they killed a passenger. The hostages weren't freed until 17 days
later.
   Terrorists set off a bomb in the passenger cabin of a TWA
jetliner over Greece in April 1986, killing four Americans.
   Other U.S. airlines that carry passengers abroad also have been
on alert following the Iran Air disaster, beefing up security in
the midst of the peak summer travel season, experts say.
   Like TWA, most big carriers have their own security divisions
but also contract with outside security companies for passenger
screening in airports and other protective services.
   Many of the airlines are touchy about security and refuse to
discuss what they're doing. But they emphasize that anti-terrorist
defenses are always intensified after such an incident.
   ``(The airlines) don't need a crystal ball; it's so obvious,''
said Dick Lally, assistant vice president for security at the Air
Transport Association, a Washington-based trade group that
represents the nation's major carriers.
   The airlines have most likely tightened their security in
consultation with the Federal Aviation Administration, Lally
suggested.
   Pamela Hanlon, a spokeswoman for Pan Am Corp., said there is
always ``heightened awareness'' of security when a potential
terrorist attack looms. ``Our security, we believe, is overall
very, very good,'' she said.
   In addition to its World Services subsidiary, which sells
security, maintenance and other services to government agencies and
other airlines, Pan Am also has an internal security division.
   After TWA, Pan Am probably has the highest profile among the
American carriers that are active overseas.
   United Airlines has increased security at some of the foreign
airports it uses, spokesman Dan Sheehy said. United, the nation's
largest carrier with scores of domestic flights, has all its
overseas operations in the Far East.
   In a similar way, Eastern Airlines specializes in Latin America
as its foreign market.
   ``We are taking additional precautions,'' said Eastern
spokeswoman Paula Musto. Eastern, a subsidiary of giant Texas Air
Corp., was the target of several hijackings to Cuba between 1979
and 1981, but drug smuggling is now its biggest security headache.
   Airlines from countries that are identified as close allies of
the United States could also be potential targets of the Iranians'
ire.
   Israel's national El Al Airlines has a reputation as the world's
toughest carrier when it comes to security. In some instances in
Europe, El Al has kept its flight routes secret from passengers
until they actually boarded the plane. El Al also sometimes uses
planes of a subsidiary that do not carry the carrier's bright blue
logo.
   ``We don't talk about our security. We just do it,'' said Aviva
Lavi, a spokeswoman for El Al in its New York office, refusing to
say whether the airline had tightened security as a result of the
Persian Gulf shooting.

   A massive oil rig fire off the coast of Scotland
will worsen a shortage of North Sea oil, but the disaster is not
likely to have a big impact on the industry, experts say.
   The fatal accident, which caused a jump in world oil prices
Thursday, prompted the government's Department of Energy to
postpone the process for granting new off-shore licenses, which
would open up more areas for exploration. The department had been
scheduled to announce on Thursday the blocks for which it was
inviting bids for the licenses.
   ``Because of what happened, we've decided to postpone that at
the moment,'' said a department spokesman, who spoke anonymously in
keeping with British practice.
   The price of Brent Blend, the most widely traded international
crude oil, jumped on Thursday to $15.05 a barrel for September
delivery, up 32 cents from late Wednesday.
   Occidental Petroleum Co., owner of the Piper Alpha rig, said a
gas leak apparently was to blame for the disaster.
   The rig produced 167,200 barrels a day, the company said. A
barrel contains 42 gallons.
   In addition to the Piper oil field, five other fields were shut
down, the department said. They were the Claymore, Tartan,
Highland, Scapa and Petronella fields, it said.
   That meant production was cut by a total of about 220,000
barrels a day to 250,000 barrels a day, or about one-tenth of the
British sector's production, the department and analysts said.
   ``There's pressure on the immediate availability for North Sea
crude,'' said Philip Morgan, an oil analyst with the London
investment firm Warburg Securities.
   Lucy Mullins, an oil analyst with the London investment firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., added, however: ``That's going to be
fairly short-term.''
   The related fields should be back in production in a week, and
Piper Alpha probably will be out of production for up to a year,
Ms. Mullins said.
   Morgan said the industry already was experiencing a shortage
because of regular maintenance, which oil companies generally do in
the summmer when the weather is milder.
   North Sea oil production in the British sector averages 2{
million barrels a day, the Department of Energy says. Production is
down 400,000 barrels a day from that level because of the
maintenance, Morgan said.
   Producers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
of which Britain is not a member, will step in to meet demand, Ms.
Mullins said.
   The oil price also has been boosted by favorable statistics
released this week, Morgan said.
   ``There is starting to be a perception that the glut in world
supplies in general is not as bad as people thought,'' Morgan said.
   Occidental Petroleum's production won't be severely affected by
the fire, because it has other outlets, Ms. Mullins said.
   There were concerns about claims against the company, however,
and Occidental Petroleum's stock fell 50 cents to $26.25 in early
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock price of British
Petroleum Co. PLC, the biggest producer in the British sector, fell
3 cents to $4.49 in afternoon trading on London's Stock Exchange.
   The disaster could prove expensive for the North Sea oil
producers in general, Morgan said.
   ``Obviously, questions are going to be raised about safety which
might involve companies in a lot more expenditure,'' Morgan said.
   The British sector of the North Sea oil fields runs from the
Shetland Islands north of Scotland down to East Anglia on England's
southeast coast, covering hundreds of thousands of square miles.
The first British sector gas fields were discovered in 1964 and oil
production began in 1975, the Department of Energy said.
   The sector employed 28,000 people in offshore facilities at the
end of last year, it said.
   There are 123 fixed installations, including the Piper Alpha
platform, in the British sector, with 40 mobile rigs, the
department said.

   President Reagan's latest nominee for a seat
on the Federal Reserve Board was accused Thursday of attempting to
dodge taxes in negotiating a $2.5-million ``golden parachute''
compensation agreement with the Boston bank holding company he
heads.
   ``I am concerned about it,'' Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said of the agreement at
the end of a confirmation hearing for John P. LaWare, chairman of
Shawmut National Corp.
   LaWare said ``I'm not sure a tax dodge was involved'' in the
compensation agreement, which he said was offered to assure him
that his annual income of about $500,000 would be continued until
he reaches age 65. He turned 60 on Feb. 20.
   Despite Proxmire's concern that the bank _ not LaWare _ is
obligated to pay a special excise tax on a portion of the pay
agreement, there was no indication the issue would affect LaWare's
nomination. In fact, Proxmire told LaWare, ``You are a very
impressive candidate for the job.''
   However, committee aides say some Democrats are reluctant to see
the nomination approved because it would mean that Reagan would
have filled all seven seats on the board, which controls the
nation's money supply.
   These senators are hoping that fellow Democrat Michael Dukakis
will be elected president and could promptly fill the Federal
Reserve seat after taking office next January.
   LaWare, a registered Democrat, would replace Henry G. Wallich,
who resigned. The 14-year term would expire Jan. 31, 2002.
   Proxmire told reporters he will confer with committee members
before deciding whether the panel should vote on the LaWare
nomination this year. Should the panel recommend the nomination, it
would be up to Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to
determine whether the Senate should consider the nomination this
year.
   The issue of monetary policy was barely mentioned at the
hearing. Most questions were about the federal budget and trade
deficits, the increasing share of U.S. debt held by foreign
investors and Third World debt.
   LaWare said he is little concerned about the fact that only one
of the world's 10 biggest banks is American. ``I don't think that
makes much difference,'' he said. ``It's how well-managed and
profitable they are ... I am more concerned with the
profit-and-loss statement'' than with size.
   None of the other committee members took up Proxmire's line of
questioning about the ``golden parachute'' agreement, which was
negotiated earlier this year as part of the merger that created
Shamut National Corp.
   Similar agreements are used to reward executives when control or
ownership of a corporation changes. In 1984, Congress required
recipients of such arrangements to pay a 20 percent excise tax on
the portion that the law considers excessive. In addition,
corporations were barred from taking a tax deduction for the
excessive payments.
   Under LaWare's agreement, which he acknowledged to be worth
about $500,000 a year, the corporation itself is obligated to pay
the 20 percent tax.
   Proxmire estimated that would save LaWare about $200,000 in
taxes.
   ``How do you justify such an attempt to dodge the tax code?''
Proxmire asked. The idea behind the 1984 law, he said, ``was to
discourage excessive payments which officers and directors vote
themselves.''
   ``I'm not sure it's a dodge,'' LaWare said. ``The tax is being
paid, regardless'' and the federal government is losing no money,
he said.
   LaWare must pay income tax on the full amount of the ``golden
parachute'' payment, including whatever amount the bank chips in to
cover the special excise tax.

<HEAD>General Mills' Profit Up 53 Percent in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. said its profit jumped 53
percent in its fourth quarter from a year earlier, boosted by a
lower tax rate, good volume growth in consumer foods, strong
performance by key restaurant chains, and significant productivity
gains.
   The food giant reported Thursday that its profit for the quarter
ended May 29 rose to $54.9 million, or 65 cents a share, from $36.1
million, or 41 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1987.
   Fourth-quarter sales increased to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion
a year earlier.
   For fiscal 1988, which was one week shorter than fiscal 1987,
earnings rose 27 percent to $283.1 million, or $3.25 a share, from
$222 million, or $2.50 a share.
   Sales in fiscal 1988 were up 10 percent, to $5.2 billion from
$4.7 billion the previous year.
   The earnings report for the fourth quarter includes the
discontinued specialty retailing operations of Talbots and Eddie
Bauer. General Mills will post a $200 million gain after taxes in
the first quarter of fiscal 1989 from the sale of the retailing
companies.
   General Mills Chairman Bruce Atwater said the consumer foods
division achieved a 4 percent increase in domestic packaged food
volume, leading to annual sales and operating profit gains of 9
percent and 11 percent, respectively. The company said the success
of several new microwave food products and growing acceptance of
Yoplait yogurt and other new foods contributed to the earnings
increase.
   Spending on Big G cereals for the fourth quarter was
particularly strong, as both volume and market share grew, Atwater
said.
   In the restaurant division, Red Lobster and Olive Garden
operations were up 16 percent. Both Leeann Chin's and York's
reported losses, including charges of $12.9 million related to
closing unprofitable units, which caused total operating profits to
be down 4 percent.
   During the fiscal year, the company invested $411 million in new
assets, an increase of 25 percent from a year earlier. Major
investments were for new food capacity, new and improved Red
Lobsters, new Olive Gardens, and investments for improved
efficiencies, Atwater said.

<HEAD>Control Data To Convert Disk Drive Operations Into Separate
Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. will convert its
disk drive operations into a separate subsidiary, a possible
prelude to a sale or partnership for the billion-dollar unit.
   Analysts said the reorganization would make it possible for
Control Data to attract a joint-venture partner or a buyer for the
unit, which accounted for nearly $1 billion of the company's $3
billion in revenue last year.
   Disk drives are devices used for storing and retrieving
computerized information at high speed.
   Louis Lundberg, a company spokesman, said creation of the
subsidiary ``will enable Control Data to explore the full spectrum
of opportunities for data storage products in the future. Those
include joint venture, partnership, acquisition or divestiture.''
   Lundberg on Wednesday confirmed the contents of a June 29 memo
from Lawrence Perlman, a Control Data executive vice president and
president of the data storage products group.
   Lundberg said Control Data had not planned to announce the move
because it was ``an internal reorganization.'' In addition to the
memo, the creation of the subsidiary was disclosed in the July 1
issue of Current, an internal Control Data publication.
   Subsidiary status also will make the disk drive operations more
competitive and free Control Data's financial resources for use in
other areas, he said, but he provided no details.
   William Easterbrook, an analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Co. Inc.
in San Francisco, said, ``It would be easier to sell a subsidiary.
A buyer can more easily see separate books, separate
profit-and-loss statements, that are not so meshed-in with the rest
of Control Data ... It makes it easier for him to think of a
price,'' he said.
   Gary Smaby, an analyst for Needham & Co. Inc. in Minneapolis,
said, ``The strategy has been set in motion that could lead to the
spinning out, refinancing or restructuring of that business''
within the next two years.
   In the refinancing area, the subsidiary might raise additional
capital through the sale of stock, Smaby said. ``It's a way to
raise capital on their own, if they need capital to be competitive,
without having to pull it from the mother corporation.''
   Lundberg confirmed that the data storage products group could
sell stock in itself to outsiders. As a group or division of
Control Data it could not do that, he said.

   Virgin Group PLC said Thursday it is considering
buying back the 28-percent stake held by the public in the British
music and entertainment company.
   Virgin Chairman Richard Branson said the company is concerned
that ``the benefits of a listing which (were) anticipated'' when
Virgin shares were sold to the public 1{ years ago ``are not being
realized.''
   Branson noted the drop in Virgin's share price to a recent range
of between $1.46 a share to $1.63 a share from the $2.41 a share
paid when the 50 million shares were sold in November 1986.
   Virgin shares, which are also traded in American Depository
Receipt form in the United States, traded at $2 a share on London's
Stock Exchange on Thursday, up 30 cents from Wednesday's close.
   ``Virgin's strategy of investment for long-term growth, with its
effects on short-term profitability, has had an adverse effect on
its share price,'' Branson said in a statement. He added that he
was not disposed toward altering this strategy for the sake of
improving the stock's performance.
   Virgin Group is separate from Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways,
the cut-rate trans-Atlantic airline which is owned by privately
held Voyager Group Ltd.

   Banca Commerciale Italiana SpA, Italy's second
largest bank, may be forced to abandon its friendly merger plans
with Irving Bank Corp. if it fails to win regulatory approval to
pay Irving shareholders a special cash dividend, experts said
Thursday.
   That could be a boon to Bank of New York, which has been bidding
for control of Irving for more than nine months, the analysts said.
   Regulators already have raised serious concerns about special
payouts, with one top official from the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York saying they should be considered only by banks with more than
adequate capital.
   ``It seems a little odd that this (the special dividend) comes
into play right now,'' when the Fed is trying to standardize
international bank capital adequacy requirements by 1992, said
James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst with the investment firm
Keefe Bruyette & Woods.
   ``1988 has been a year when most major money-center banks have
been building capital, not paying out extra dividends,'' he said.
   But a proposed $10-a-share special cash dividend is a key
element of Banca Commerciale's offer to buy a majority stake in
Irving as an alternative to Bank of New York's hostile bid.
   The Milan-based bank is offering $80 a share for 51 percent of
Irving's 18.5 million common shares outstanding and the special
dividend for the remaining 49 percent.
   Earlier this week it sweetened the offer to include warrants
entitling shareholders to buy newly issued Irving stock at $65 a
share over the next seven years. Stockholders would receive one
warrant for every four shares they now own. The offer is valued at
a minimum of $79.50 a share.
   Bank of New York, which owns a 4.9 percent stake in Irving, is
offering $15 in cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each of
Irving's common shares outstanding. The offer is valued at around
$68 a share or $1.2 billion.
   ``From a practical standpoint I would think if the Fed was to
disallow the (Banca Commerciale) special dividend ... that would
place pressure on BCI to increase its offer in a tangible manner,''
said Michael Starr, a banking analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc.
   ``I wouldn't think it would have to be a dollar-for-dollar
match. I don't think the market expected the full $10 to go through
anyway. That was a major `if.'''
   A number of analysts agreed that at some point it might no
longer be economically feasible for Banca Commerciale to continue
with the deal, leaving Irving alone with Bank of New York's
persistent takeover advances.
   ``I believe it (current offer) already is at the upper end of
the range,'' said McDermott.
   Patricia Skigen, of Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, Banca
Commerciale's legal adviser, said her client remained committed to
the Irving merger.
   ``The offer that we made is outstanding,'' Ms. Skigen said.
   She contended the Fed's reservations about special dividends,
contained in a letter dated Wednesday to all three banks by New
York Fed executive vice president Frederick C. Schadrack, was meant
solely as a ``a spot policy statement to the world at large.''
   The Fed also must determine whether to grant Bank of New York an
extension of conditional approval for its proposed merger with
Irving. Bank of New York asked for 60 more days on Thursday; the
Fed approval was due to expire Saturday.
   In addition, a New York appeals court will be faced with
deciding whether a provison of Irving's anti-takeover ``poison
pill'' is valid. It was struck down by the New York state Supreme
Court on Wednesday, but Irving has vowed to appeal.
   In other developments Thursday, a court-appointed referee
refused to change the outcome of a crucial proxy vote in which
shareholders re-elected Irving's board of directors over Bank of
New York's nominees.
   The referee did decide, however, that a block of 450,000 votes
of Irving shares belonged in Bank of New York's camp and that an
amendment to Irving's bylaws alolowing 10 percent of holders to
call a special shareholder meeting had passed.

   Stock prices drifted lower today in a carryover
of selling from Wednesday's drop.
   Analysts said the market's downturn Wednesday from 1988 highs
reached earlier in the week intensified recent concerns that the
early-summer rally in stock prices might be topping out.
   In addition, interest rates rose today in the credit markets.
Yields on long-term Treasury bonds have climbed of late back above
9 percent, driven in large measure by recurring worries about
inflation.
   The Labor Department is due to report Friday morning on the
employment situation for June.
   If the data show strong job growth, brokers say traders might
read it as a signal of increasing inflationary pressures.

   Assets of the nation's 441 money market mutual
funds rose $468.8 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $264.84 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a decline of $1.92 billion in the funds' assets
the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual fund
trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $280.02 billion in the week
ended Feb. 24.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 122 institutional funds fell $458.8 million to $69.64
billion, assets of 220 general purpose funds increased $316.4
million to $81.76 billion, and assets of 99 broker-dealer funds
increased $611.2 million to $113.44 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.68 percent from 6.62 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose, to 6.58 percent from 6.52
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
unchanged at 35 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts rose to
5.76 percent as of Wednesday from 5.74 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, slipped to 5.12 percent from 5.13 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.15
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.12 the
previous week. Yields were 7.48 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.47
percent; 7.84 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 8.26 percent

   The dollar rose modestly against several major
currencies but fell against the Japanese yen Thursday in light
trading as the West German central bank continued to try driving
down the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices were slightly higher. Republic National Bank of New
York said gold was bid at $438.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up
from $438.75 an ounce late Wednesday.
   The dollar had fallen slightly in Europe but recovered as
traders who had sold dollars short bought the U.S. currency after
running into resistance in their effort to drive it down, said
Peter Hanson, a vice president at Bear, Stearns & Co.
   Some traders were looking forward to market reaction to Friday's
U.S. unemployment figures and next Friday's U.S. trade report.
   The dollar was put under some pressure by repeated but
apparently modest dollar sales by the West German central bank,
dealers in Europe said.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7180 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7130 late
Wednesday. But later in New York, the pound fell to $1.7134 from
$1.7157 late Wednesday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell to a closing 132.40 Japanese yen from 133.53 yen at
Wednesday's close. In London, the dollar was trading at 131.70 yen.
Later in New York, the dollar ended at 132.73 yen, up from its
levels late in London, but down from 133.38 yen late Wednesday in
New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8221 West German marks, up from
1.8207; 1.5151 Swiss francs, up from 1.5124; 1.2080 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2072; 6.1325 French francs, down from 6.1365;
and 1,349.75 Italian lire, down from 1,350.00.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8161 West German marks, down from
1.8217; 1.5100 Swiss francs, down from 1.5135; 6.1140 French
francs, down from 6.1315; 2.0440 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0515;
1,346.50 Italian lire, down from 1,351.75; and 1.2050 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.2168.
   In Hong Kong, gold closed at $441.62 a troy ounce, up from
$441.05 an ounce late Wednesday.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $440.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $436.75 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold was
higher, closing at a bid $441 compared with Wednesday's late
$437.50.
   At the close of trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York
gold bullion for current delivery was bid at $439.10 a troy ounce,
up from $438.60 an ounce late Wednesday.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid of $6.98 a troy ounce, compared with
$6.77 an ounce late Wednesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery was bid at $6.935 a troy ounce, up from $6.819
an ounce late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Commission OKs One-Share, One-Vote Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted
Thursday to limit the ability of American companies to weaken the
voting power of their stockholders as way of fighting hostile
corporate raids.
   The new one-share, one-vote rule, approved 4-1, does not
altogether ban dual classes of common stock, but rather spells out
how shares with reduced voting power can be issued.
   One popular takeover defense, in which companies entice
stockholders into giving up their voting rights by offering a
special one-time dividend, would be prohibited.
   Also barred would be rules that require a stock purchaser to
wait, sometimes for several years, before newly acquired shares
accrue full voting rights.
   Companies will have to comply with the new SEC rule if they want
their stock traded on an exchange or through the National
Association of Securities Dealers' automated quotation system.
   However, in another voting rights area, the SEC decided to defer
to the states. In states that allow it, companies will be permitted
to deny voting power to takeover raiders unless the other
shareholders approve.
   About a dozen states have adopted such laws and the SEC, in
friend-of-the-court briefs, has argued that they improperly
interfere with national securities markets.
   In unrelated action, the commission voted unanimously to back
off from recommending congressional legislation barring brokerage
firms from requiring customers to agree in advance to settle
disputes before an arbitration panel.
   State securities regulators and others have been arguing that
so-called ``pre-dispute arbitration clauses'' in the fine print of
account agreements are unfair because they require customers, in
some cases unwittingly, to sign away their right to sue in court
before they know the nature of any disagreement that may arise.
   Richard G. Ketchum, director of the SEC's division of market
regulation, said he doubted the new one-share, one-vote rule would
have a dramatic effect on takeovers. But he conceded that in a few
cases takeovers would be easier because the rule eliminates some
``extremely effective'' defenses.
   Commissioner Charles C. Cox, the only member to vote against the
rule, said he believed the SEC was intruding into an area that has
traditionally been left to states: the chartering and governance of
corporations.
   ``I believe this is an improper use of the listing standards to
tamper with corporate governance,'' he said.
   However, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said the rule is structured
``to be as least intrusive as possible.''
   Companies will still be permitted to issue new shares with
diluted voting power. Diluted-power shares can also be issued to
accomplish a merger. And private companies going public will be
able to issue both strong-voting and weak-voting shares.
   However, corporations will not be able to issue ``supershares''
that have more voting power than common stock already issued. That
would have allowed company insiders, such as managers, to buy up
the strong shares to acquire control over the company.
   Stocks of foreign companies traded in the United States will be
exempted from the regulations. The 359 U.S. companies that had
disparate voting rights before Thursday will also be exempted, as
will the stocks of small companies listed in the NASD's so-called
``pink sheets'' and traded by brokers over the telephone.
   Despite the exceptions, the rule drew praise from the United
Shareholders Association, which is headed by Texas oilman and
takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens Jr.
   ``The SEC's action helps to restore democracy to corporate
America,'' Pickens said in a statement.
   Commission debate over the rule approved Thursday began nearly
two years ago when the New York Stock Exchange in September 1986
asked for SEC permission to drop its 60-year-old one-share,
one-vote standard.
   Exchange officials said they were dropping the standard
reluctantly out of fear of losing business to the American Stock
Exchange, which had more liberal rules, and the NASD, which had no
such standard.
   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, and others have argued that the SEC does not have
jurisdiction over the matter and should defer to Congress.
   However, Commissioner Edward H. Fleischman said Congress has not
acted in two years and that the law requires the SEC to approve or
disapprove changes in exchange rules.
   On the arbitration issue, the SEC voted to ask the stock
exchanges and the NASD to study pre-dispute clauses and to report
back to the commission by Oct. 15.
   Nevertheless, Reps. Rick Boucher, D-Va.; John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., and Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., have gone ahead and
introduced a bill anyway.
   The head of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which represents state regulators, called the SEC
decision ``disappointing.''
   ``Small investors will see the commission failure to act as
another sign that the deck is stacked against them,'' said James C.
Meyer, president of the association and Tennessee's top securities
regulator.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Australian airline Qantas has ordered two
Boeing 747-400s and one 767-300 with extended range capability,
Boeing Commercial Airplanes said Thursday.
   The planes will be delivered between September and December 1989
and will cost about $380 million, including spare parts and
support, Boeing said in a news release.
   Qantas Chairman J.B. Leslie said the new planes, which will give
Qantas a 43-plane fleet, will serve the growing tourist market to
Australia. The airplanes will be financed by Qantas' foreign
exchange earnings and by overseas borrowings, he said.
   The order gives Qantas six of the advanced-technology 747-400s,
the world's largest commercial jetliner, and five extended-range
767-300s.
   The four-engine 747-400, which made its first flight this
spring, can carry up to 660 passengers. With a more typical
configuration for 412 in two classes, the plane can fly more than
7,300 nautical miles, or from San Francisco to Melbourne.
   The twin-engine 767-300 is capable of hauling up to 375
passengers, but can fly more than 7,000 miles with 210 aboard.
   So far this year, Boeing has had orders for 401 jetliners worth
$18.2 billion, compared with 366 jets worth a record $19.9 billion
in 1987.
   Boeing now has 148 orders for 747-400s and 103 orders for
767-300s.

<HEAD>FMC Gets New Bradley Fighting Vehicle Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $289 million contract for continued
production of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle for the U.S. Army has
been awarded to FMC Corp.'s ground systems division, the company
said Thursday.
   Work on the 334 infantry and 216 cavalry Bradley Fighting
Vehicles and 44 Bradley carriers for the multiple launch rocket
system will be done at the company's Santa Clara plant. Delivery is
scheduled between May 1, 1989, and April 30, 1990.
   The contract provides $280 million for the products, and $9
million in a price-incentive contract to provide engineering
support in production.
   Last December, Pentagon officials told Congress they planned to
thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent ``more
survivable'' in battle. Other changes announced included
redesigning the fuel system, moving some ammunition around inside
the crew compartment and developing explosive armor.
   The first Bradley Fighting Vehicle was delivered in 1982. FMC,
based in Chicago, delivered about 3,100 Bradleys out of an order of
6,880 for $1.55 million each as of last December. Most of the
vehicles have been stationed in Europe.
   Congressional, Army and FMC records show numerous mechanical and
electrical components on the vehicle designed as an amphibious
armored personnel carrier have failed repeatedly in recent years.
   But Col. Franklin Trapnell, system manager for the Bradley at
the Army's Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Benning, Ga., has
said that the vehicle may have flaws but going into a war without
it would ``cause us to lose and do a lot of dying in the process.''

<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybean futures prices plummeted their limits for
daily trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, taking some
analysts by surprise and leaving them divided on the reasons for
the move.
   On other markets, gasoline futures soared and other energy
futures also gained; livestock and meat were mixed; precious metals
advanced; and stock-index futures gained.
   ``I'm astounded,'' Katharina Zimmer, New York-based grains
analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc., said after the
grain and soybean markets closed.
   Most corn, soybean and oat contracts plunged their respective
15-, 30- and 10-cent limits for daily trading, and the limitless
contracts for July delivery fell even further. Wheat contracts for
December, March and July 1989 delivery tumbled 20 cents a bushel,
the limit in that market.
   Despite new forecasts for weekend rains in the dry and dusty
Midwest, Ms. Zimmer said the sell-off was technically inspired.
   ``This market has nothing to do with fundamentals any more,''
she said. Instead, she said, Thursday's action was dominated by
so-called technicians, who base their trading decisions on
historical chart patterns.
   On Thursday, the charts indicated it was time to sell, Ms.
Zimmer said.
   More likely, the drop was caused by a combination of technical
and fundamental factors, said Ted Mao, grain specialist with
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Though prices turned lower shortly after the opening, Mao said
the sharpest drop followed midday news reports that Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., had said the Senate may consider
measures allowing farmers to plant soybeans and oats on a portion
of their acreage idled under government crop programs.
   But Dole, speaking to the Commodity Club in Washington, said the
Senate probably would not act on the matter for at least another
month.
   Private forecasts for moderate rainfall this weekend in the
northern Corn Belt also pressured the markets, Mao said.
   ``The market continues to show its sensitivity to prospects of
getting even a little bit of rain,'' he said.
   ``That's nonsense,'' countered Ms. Zimmer, who dismissed the
expected rain as ``sprinkles.''
   ``To tell an Illinois farmer we're locked limit-down because of
the rain we're going to get, I don't know what they'd say, but it
probably would not be printable,'' she said.
   Wheat settled 15{ cents to 20 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.78 a bushel; corn was 14{ cents to 22 cents
lower with July at $3.20 a bushel; oats were 10 cents to 22 cents
lower with July at $3.01 a bushel; soybeans were 26 cents to 49{
cents lower with July at $9.34{ a bushel.
   Prices for future delivery of unleaded gasoline and heating oil
soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange in reaction to
Wednesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report showing a
sharp drawdown in gasoline supplies, analysts said.
   Energy futures were broadly supported by reports that the tragic
explosion of a North Sea oil rig could cause production of North
Sea crude oil to fall by 30,000 barrels a day, said Nauman Barakat,
energy analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Crude-oil futures declined on profit-taking in the second half
of the session, he said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 43 cents to 55 cents
higher with August at $15.83 a barrel; heating oil was 1.37 cents
to 1.68 cents higher with August at 44.29 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.23 cents to 2.56 cents higher with August at 53.12
cents a gallon.
   The inflationary implications of higher energy prices supported
precious metals futures on New York's Commodity Exchange, analysts
said.
   Gold settled 40 cents to $1.20 higher with August at $441.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 11.5 cents to 13.6 cents higher with July at
$6.935 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   The drop in grain prices prompted reversals of recent
drought-related trends in the cattle and hog markets, and pork
bellies rebounded sharply after touching 8-year lows on Wednesday,
said Paul Hare, an analyst with Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago.
   Live cattle were .60 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August
at 64.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent
higher with August at 74.75 cents a pound; hogs were 1.50 cents
lower to .83 cent higher with July at 45.40 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .70 cent lower to 2 cents higher with July at
34.40 cents a pound.
   Stock-index futures finished higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for September delivery of the Standard
& Poor's index settled 1.20 points higher at 273.20.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise in Late June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three measures of the nation's money supply rose
in the week ended June 27, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure known as M1 rose $400 million
to a seasonally adjusted $778.8 billion from a revised $778.4
billion the previous week.
   A broader measure, M2, rose to a seasonally adjusted $3.020
trillion from $3.018 trillion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted
$3.809 trillion from $3.804 trillion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates as well as
money supply trends.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $857 million,
compared with a decline of $561 million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $1.301 billion, up from $541 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reprted that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $2.789 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from
$2.782 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>GE's Earnings Up 23 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. on Thursday said
its second quarter profit jumped 16 percent because of strong
performances by the company's plastics, broadcasting and financial
services operations.
   The Fairfield-based company said net earnings totaled $835
million, or 93 cents a share, up from $720 million, or 79 cents a
share originally reported for the the same period a year ago.
   GE's 1987 quarterly earnings were restated at year-end to
reflect adoption of new income tax accounting rules. The company
said in a statement that ongoing operations are not affected by the
change.
   Sales during the second quarter totaled $9.25 billion, off 3
percent from $9.56 billion in the previous quarter when sales of
the company's consumer electronics businesses were included.
   GE-RCA Consumer Electronics, which contributed about $3 billion
a year in sales, was sold to Thomson SA of France late last year.
   ``With these results, GE is well on its way to a second
consecutive full year of strong double-digit increases in
earnings,'' said GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr.
   Welch also said that since the last earnings report, the company
has forged several important agreements, one with labor and two to
expand the plastics business.
   On Wednesday, GE's largest union, the International Union of
Electronic Workers, overwhelmingly ratified a new three-year
national contract.
   GE Plastics formed a joint venture with Union Carbide Corp.'s
silicone business. GE also signed a definitive agreement to
Borg-Warner Corp.'s chemical businesses for about $2.3 billion.
   The company said NBC's television operations posted solid
improvements in profits, while revenue held at last year's levels.
   Earnings for the first six months of 1988 were $1.56 billion, or
$1.73 a share, up 16 percent from $1.34 billion, or $1.47 a share
in the first half of last year.
   Sales during the period totaled $17.22 billion, down 4 percent
from $17.86 billion in the year-ago period, which included the
consumer electronics operations.

<HEAD>Irish Company Buys Option to Take 10 Percent of Braniff</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   AMSTERDAM _ GPA Group Ltd. said Thursday it has acquired an
option to buy 10 percent of Braniff Inc.
   GPA Group, a privately-owned financial services company based in
Ireland, specializes in aircraft asset management.
   BIA-COR Holdings Inc., a U.S. investment group, recently
acquired Dallas-based Braniff from Dalfort Corp. for $100 million.
   GPA Group said the option is part of a transaction under which
an Irish-Dutch leasing affiliate of GPA will sell Braniff 12
medium-haul aircraft made by the Dutch maker of Fokker planes. The
leasing affiliate will sell 12 new F-100 fanjets to Braniff for a
combination of cash and 12 aging BAC-111 planes now owned by
Braniff.
   GPA Group will also have the option to acquire 10 percent of
Braniff's common stock.
   Under the deal, the leasing affiliate will lease the BAC-111s
back to Braniff for use until the new F-100s are built and
delivered sometime between September 1989 and December 1990.
   The entire transaction is worth around $300 million, according
to analysts.
   American Airlines, a rival of Braniff, recently agreed to lend
Braniff as much as $21 million, according to documents filed
Tuesday by BIA-COR Holdings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Fort Worth-based American already has loaned Braniff $14.4
million, the documents showed. American, which competes with
Braniff at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, also agreed to
purchase $19 million to $23 million of Braniff's assets.

<HEAD>Asbestos Defendant Files Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UNR Industries Inc. filed a reorganization plan
Thursday to settle nearly $113 million in debts and about 90,000
personal-injury claims stemming from exposure to its asbestos
products.
   Under the plan, all creditors and health claimants would become
shareholders in the Chicago-based steel-tubing maker, which stopped
manufacturing asbestos pipe insulation in 1962.
   The plan calls for business creditors to exchange their $112.7
million in claims for 28 percent of the stock in the restructured
company, which will have equity in excess of $190 million,
according to UNR attorney Malcolm Gaynor.
   Personal-injury claimants would receive 64 percent of the common
stock of the restructured company and current shareholders would
receive 8 percent, Gaynor said.
   Current shareholders also would receive the right to purchase
enough stock, at $5.15 per share, to double their holdings during
the next six years, he said.
   Asbestos, commonly used as an insulating material until the
early 1960s, can cause a range of respiratory ailments when its
fibers are inhaled.
   Most of the health claims were filed by shipyard workers who
said their contact with UNR's asbestos pipe insulation had caused
them to develop health problems, Gaynor said.
   Stock earmarked for the claimants would be placed in a pool to
be divided among all current and future claimants, he said.
   ``Out of that fund will come the cost of determining who it will
go to,'' Gaynor said. ``We're saying, `Here's a block of stock.
It's your problem to divide it up at your expense.'''
   He said the plan was endorsed by representatives of UNR's
largest creditors and the personal-injury claimants. Creditors and
claimants still must vote on the plan, although no date for the
vote has been set, Gaynor said.
   He said U.S. District Judge William J. Norton, the
court-appointed examiner in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court case, also
had endorsed the plan.
   UNR filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in 1982 after the cost of defending itself against
asbestos-related personal-injury claims contributed to a
second-quarter loss of $8.9 million.
   UNR, a holding company consisting of Unarco Industries Inc., UNR
Inc. and UNR Products Inc., reported a profit of nearly $1.9
million for the first quarter of 1988.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co.'s largest union,
representing 40,000 workers, overwhelmingly ratified a new contract
and 11 smaller unions were expected to follow suit, labor leaders
said Thursday.
   Members of the International Union of Electronic Workers voted
nearly 5-to-1 in favor of the three-year pact with all but two of
the 72 locals reporting, union spokesman Jerry Borstel.
   The two locals who had not reported represent just 20 workers.
   ``It's pretty final,'' Borstel said.
   Sixty-six locals approved the pact, three rejected it, and one
local split evenly. The vote was 33,378 to 6,785 to approve the
pact, he said.
   ``The overwhelming vote to ratify shows that the IUE membership
is satisfied with this settlement, which is worth more than the
1985 contract and is better than any other agreement negotiated in
industry this year,'' said IUE President William Bywater.
   Bywater said he expected the 11 smaller unions that joined the
IUE at the bargaining table to ratify the contract.
   The tentative agreement, reached June 26, calls for a special
early retirement package; three annual wage increases of 2.5
percent, 1.5 percent and 1.5 percent; two cash bonuses; reduced
employee pension contributions; preferential hiring for IUE
members; dependent care aid, and other improvements.
   The average hourly wage of $12.02 would rise to $13.40, assuming
4.5 percent annual inflation, according to GE figures. The average
employee stands to gain about $6,100 over the life of the contract.
   Workers covered by the pact produce everything from light bulbs
to appliances, medical equipment to aerospace products, and
maintain factories and machinery.
   Each union must ratify the pact by Sunday for its terms to be
retroactive, GE spokesman Jack Batty said.

<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reading & Bates Corp. announced Thursday it
will sell its oil and gas subsidiary and move its corporate
headquarters to Houston, where it will concentrate on offshore
drilling.
   About 30 employees were laid off Thursday, and another 100 will
lose their jobs in the next few months, officials said. The company
has about 2,000 employees worldwide.
   J.W. Bates Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said the
move to Houston is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
   Another subsidiary, Reading & Bates Drilling Co. has maintained
offices in Houston for more than 30 years.
   ``Obviously, the decision has been a very difficult one,'' said
Bates, who helped start the company in 1955.
   But he said it is necessary because there has been no turnaround
for the oil industry. Reading & Bates has had three years of losses
and a fourth is anticipated, he said.
   ``I think there's no question it'll get better,'' Bates said.
``The question is, when. If the company is to survive as a major
international offshore drilling contractor, which has been our
principal business throughout the years, we have no alternative.''
   Reading & Bates operates a fleet of 18 offshore drilling rigs
throughout the world. The company also owns Resources Conservation
Co., a process engineering company located in Seattle, and Reading
& Bates Coal Co. operating in eastern Kentucky.
   Reading & Bates disposed of its pipeline construction business
in 1985. In 1987, the company completed sale of its foreign oil and
gas production, its horizontal drilling operations and its part of
a land drilling venture in Argentina.
   It reported losses of $191 million, in 1987, $145.8 million in
1986 and $190.6 million in 1985.
   The company is in default of all leases, subject to continuing
negotiations, in an amount estimated at $272.2 million as of Dec.
31, 1987. The company and its lenders are continuing to negotiate
terms of a restructuring agreement, Bates said.
   ``Hopefully, that will be accomplished by the end of the year,
or certainly next year,'' he said.
   Bates said he does not believe the company will have any trouble
finding a buyer for the petroleum company.
   Reading & Bates Petroleum Co. had operating revenues of about
$25 million in 1987, and proved developed reserves in the U.S. of
5.7 million barrels of oil and 70 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
   ``There is intense interest in acquiring reserves,'' Bates said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday backed off from recommending legislation that would
guarantee investors the right to sue their stock broker in court.
   The commission had been considering asking Congress to outlaw
clauses in brokerage account agreements requiring customers to
settle disputes through industry-sponsored arbitration panels,
rather than through the courts.
   But, by a 5-0 vote, the commission decided instead to ask stock
exchanges and other organizations that run arbitration systems to
study the matter and report back by Oct. 15.
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
subcommittee with jurisdiction over the securities markets, said
the SEC had caved in to industry lobbying with its decision.
   ``Apparently there was a full-court press by the industry that
was successful,'' Markey said. ``...I think the industry stared
into the SEC's eyes on this issue and the SEC blinked.''
   When the commission discussed the arbitration clauses last
month, the legislative recommendation looked headed for approval.
It was supported by SEC Chairman David S. Ruder and member Aulana
L. Peters. Commissioner Charles C. Cox said he was inclined to
favor it but wanted to hear from securities firms, which strongly
opposed banning the clauses.
   But, on Thursday, Ruder retreated from his earlier support. He
said he was persuaded to defer action after learning the industry
would at least favor disclosure notices to customers explaining the
meaning of the clauses.
   An SEC survey found that 39 percent of cash accounts carry
arbitration agreements and that firms holding another 40 percent
were considering using such clauses.
   But Ruder said many firms that were once looking into using the
clauses for cash accounts appear to be holding off at least for
now. He also said some regional firms have recently made a point of
advertising that they will open cash accounts without arbitration
clauses.
   However, nearly all firms surveyed, 95 percent, require
arbitration agreements for option and margin accounts, where the
risk of loss is greater.
   Proponents of the clauses argue that customers are free to
negotiate the clauses out of the contract and that firms have a
right to set the conditions under which they're willing to do
business.
   Administration officials, including Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers, had sent letters to the SEC
criticizing staff proposals on arbitration clauses.
   Despite the lack of SEC support, Reps. Rick Boucher, D-Va.; John
D. Dingell, D-Mich., and Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., have introduced
legislation anyway.
   The bill is backed by state securities regulators and others who
say arbitration clauses are unfair because they require customers
to sign away their right to sue before they know the nature of any
disagreement that may arise.
   The head of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, which represents state regulators, called the SEC
decision ``disappointing.''
   ``If the commission's mistake goes uncorrected, investors will
end up having only those rights which the securities industry
chooses to give them. ... Small investors will see the commission
failure to act as another sign that the deck is stacked against
them,'' said James C. Meyer, president of the association and
Tennessee's top securities regulator.
   Ruder, however, said, ``I want to make it clear that (this) ...
is not a decision to de-emphasize consumer interest in the
securities industry.''

   A former secretary to Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita was added Thursday to the list of aides to top
politicians who reportedly profited from questionable stock
dealings in a scandal sweeping Japanese business and politics.
   Takeshita told reporters that his former secretary, Ihei Aoki,
earned profits by trading the shares of the real estate company
Recruit-Cosmos. He said Aoki obtained shares from the company and
then sold them shortly after Recruit-Cosmos went public in October
1986, when Takeshita was finance minister.
   In related developments, the president of Japan's leading
economic newspaper and the chairman of Recruit-Cosmos resigned. The
chairman of Recruit-Cosmos and its parent company also announced he
will step down.
   The dealings were not illegal, but critics said the case
illustrates doubtful ethics in the links between Japan's
politicians and businessmen.
   Takeshita did not elaborate on the number of shares Aoki traded
or his profits from the deal, and refused to take responsibility
for his former aide's action.
   But Takeshita acknowledged that the scandal would seriously
affect an upcoming session of the Diet, Japan's parliament, when
the administration hopes to push through a major tax reform measure.
   The controversy surfaced last month as a bribery case in a local
government, but entered a new phase with revelations that aides to
leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party profited with
Recruit-Cosmos stock.
   In addition to Takeshita, the scandal has affected secretaries
of Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary General and former
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, former Defense Agency Director
General Koichi Kato, and Michio Watanabe, the former minister of
international trade and industry..
   Of them, only Miyazawa has denied knowing of the stock deals.
The others said they had become aware their aides had received the
stock and made profits.
   ``This involves the most senior (Liberal Democratic Party)
officials, and there is going to be a major outcry from the
Japanese people,'' said Shigeru Ito, a leader of the main
opposition Japan Socialist Party. ``Although they broke no law,
they abused their positions to line their pockets.''
   Saburo Tsukamoto, chairman of Democratic Socialist Party, the
third largest opposition party, also was found on the list of 76
people who reportedly profited from the transactions.
   According to Japanese press reports, Recruit-Cosmos gave or sold
stock at an artificially low price to high-ranking politicians. In
some instances, the company reportedly lent money to politicians to
buy the shares.
   When the company went public in October 1986 and the stock price
soared, the politicians were able to reap large profits, the
reports said.
   It was not clear what, if anything, the politicians did for
Recruit-Cosmos in return.
   ``Whether they are politicians or company heads, those who have
responsibilities must behave prudently, not to be criticized by the
general public,'' Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi said in the
only official comment from the government on the matter.
   Not only politicians are involved in the scandal.
   Ko Morita, president of Japan's leading economic daily, Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, resigned Wednesday after it was revealed that he
had dealt in Recruit-Cosmos shares, violating the rules of his
newspaper.
   Hiromasa Ezoe, chairman of Recruit-Cosmos and its parent company
Recruit Ltd., a giant information service firm, also announced that
he will resign the two chairmanships.
   The president of Recruit, Naotaka Ida, said Ezoe will also
withdraw from the government's tax commission.
   ``Politicians want as much money as they can get, and
businessmen always look for connections with politicians,'' said an
editorial in Asahi Shimbun, the newspaper that broke the story.
   The controversy is the latest in a series of scandals to rock
Japan's long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party.
   Six people have been indicted since May for allegedly arranging
bribes by advertising agencies to gain public relations contracts
with the prime minister's office.
   Last month, five executives of a Tokyo electronics firm who made
large donations to both the Liberal Democratic and Japan Socialist
parties were arrested for evading income taxes of $12 million,
earned from illegal stocks manipulation.
   Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was found guilty in 1983 of
accepting bribes from the Lockheed Corp. of the United States, but
he remained an important force in Japanese politics until he
suffered a stroke in 1985.
   Takeshita's faction within the ruling party is made up mainly of
former Tanaka followers.

<HEAD>Jury Finds For ESM In Civil Lawsuit Against Warner</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with jury verdict, editing to
conform. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Thursday awarded
$22.6 million to the estate of now-defunct ESM Government
Securities, ruling against financier Marvin Warner, whom the firm
claimed had unjustly profited from its 1985 failure.
   The jury deliberated seven hours before ruling in favor of ESM
on civil complaints in the lawsuit accusing Warner of fraudulently
taking money out of the troubled securities firm when he knew the
firm was in dire financial trouble, of profiting from insider
information, and of loaning ESM money in exchange for profits on
bogus financial transactions.
   Warner's Cincinnati-based thrift, Home State Savings Bank, was
ESM's biggest customer. Home State collapsed shortly after ESM
failed in 1985, triggering a savings and loan panic in Ohio.
   Warner, 69, said he would appeal. He was visibly upset when he
heard the verdict and said: ``The jury has spoken. I'm stunned.
Terribly.''
   Warner's attorney, Andrew Hall, said it was ``clearly a decision
based on court passion. Clearly the jury did not understand what
this case was about.''
   District Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr. had given the jury 22 questions
to consider and they ruled in favor of ESM Trustee Thomas Tew on
every question, including the amounts requested by the plaintiffs.
   The lawsuit also had claimed Warner violated securities,
racketeering and civil theft statutes and that he unjustly profited
from ESM's 1985 failure.
   Warner won a strategic victory just before the start of
deliberations Wednesday when Gonzalez determined the plaintiff had
not proven Warner was involved in securities fraud.
   But in Thursday's verdict, the jury found that he ``actually
participated in the fraudulent purpose'' of ESM Government
Securities.
   Although he dismissed the fraud counts, Gonzalez did not change
the amount of damages that could be sought. The judge earlier
reduced the damages sought from $62 million to $22 million.
   Before the verdict, Warner said: ``Regardless of the financial
outcome, what that judge did vindicated me.''
   Warner last year was acquitted of federal criminal charges but
convicted of state charges in Ohio and sentenced to three years in
connection with the collapse of Home State. He is free while
appealing that conviction.
   Much of the blame for the thrift's problems was placed on
Warner, who held a personal account at ESM and had encouraged Home
State to invest with the obscure Fort Lauderdale firm.
   Tew's lawyers claimed Warner was an insider at ESM who demanded
and was given special treatment because of Home State's huge
investments with ESM.
   Before the verdict, Tew said he was disappointed by the
dismissal of the fraud counts but that the damage to his suit was
minimal.
   Hall said the dismissal of the four fraud counts supported his
claim that Warner was a victim, and not a perpetrator, of fraud at
ESM.
   ``The largest single victim of ESM's fraud is Marvin Warner,''
Hall said in closing arguments. ``If you are a victim, how can you
be an insider.''
   As evidence, Hall repeatedly reminded jurors that Warner
continued to invest money and real estate with ESM after allegedly
learning of the firm's troubles.
   But Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, the attorney for Tew, argued that
Warner had to keep investing in ESM because ESM and Home State were
dependent on each other for survival.

   Sun Co. Inc.'s board of directors on
Thursday approved a major restructuring plan that will spin off the
company's $4.8 billion domestic oil and gas exploration and
production business into an independent company and trim its work
force by more than 1,000.
   The plan also calls for the nation's 10th largest oil company to
expand its international exploration and production operations, as
well as its refining and marketing business, which will be retained
by the restructured Sun, company officials said.
   It comes two days after Sun announced it had agreed to buy
Atlantic Petroleum Corp., a Northeast refiner and retailer, for
$513 million from oil trader John Duess.
   The reorganization is projected as a major-cost savings move for
the Radnor-based company, said Peter Waitneight, vice president of
corporate financing.
   ``The earnings have not been growing in the rather weak market
for crude oil and natural gas,'' Waitneight said in a telephone
interview.
   He said company officials believe that payroll reductions and
independent management structures for the separate companies would
result in higher earnings that would boost profits.
   Under the plan, current Sun shareholders would receive a
one-for-one tax-free distribution of stock in the newly created Sun
Exploration and Production Co., which will handle domestic oil and
gas exploration and production.
   The redistribution is subject to approval by shareholders and
dependent on the Internal Revenue Service granting it tax-free
status.
   The new company, to be headquartered in Dallas, would become the
largest independent oil and gas producer in North America, with
approximately $4.8 billion in assets and $1.6 billion in revenue in
1987, Sun officials said.
   The original Sun would restructure with more than $9 billion in
assets. Excluding the domestic oil and gas exploration and
production business, Sun totaled $9.1 billion in revenue last year.
   Waitneight said the distribution would be presented for
shareholders' consideration during a special meeting in early
October, with distribution of shares, if approved, planned for the
end of October.
   Reduction of the work force will begin immediately, Waitneight
said.
   About 800 Sun workers employed in the new company's operations,
most of them in the Western United States, will lose their jobs,
Waitneight said.
   Another 250 workers at the restructured Sun, most of them in the
East and many in the Philadelphia area, also will lose their jobs,
he said.
   Company officials said some employees would be offered early
retirment incentives, but Waitneight would not specify how many.
   Sun officials expect the restructuring to produce $65 million in
after-tax savings for Sun E&P each year and $15 million for the
restructured Sun each year, most of that through payroll reductions.
   ``The driving force behind this decision is to enhance value for
holders of Sun stock,'' said Robert McClements Jr., chairman and
chief executive officer of Sun.
   Robert P. Hauptfuhrer, Sun's president and chief operating
officer, was named by the Sun board as the chairman and chief
executive officer of the newly created Sun E&P. James McCormick,
who heads the company's exploration and production operations, will
become the president and chief operating officer of Sun E&P.
   Sun Company has more than 20,000 employees in the United States
and eight other countries. It has refineries in Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Puerto Rico and Canada and mines coal in five states. Sun
sells gasoline under the Sunoco brand.
   Atlantic has one refinery with 440 employees in Philadelphia,
owns 571 gas stations and supplies another 400 independent
stations, primarily in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey.
   The Atlantic purchase also includes 30 oil terminals owned by
Atlantic plus its 986-mile products pipeline system from its
refinery to Pittsburgh, Pa., and Rochester and Tonawanda, N.Y.
   Sun reported revenue of $2.39 billion in the first quarter of
1988, compared to $2.26 billion in the first quarter of 1987. Net
income for the first quarter of 1988 was $60 million or $.57 per
share of common stock, a 58 percent increase from the $38 million
or $.35 per share of common stock in the first quarter of 1987.

   A 17-story tower will be built to house the
growing Museum of Broadcasting, board Chairman William S. Paley
announced Thursday.
   ``This wonderful new building gives the museum the space it
needs,'' said Paley, founder of CBS. ``It dramatically marks the
museum's coming of age.''
   Paley said he hopes the extra space can double the 100,000
people a year now drawn to the 12-year-old museum, whose 37-member
board includes Alan Alda, Lucille Ball, Steven Bochco, Norman Lear,
Marlo Thomas and Grant Tinker.
   The groundbreaking on a vacant lot on West 52nd Street, next
door to the 21 Club, is planned for September. Construction should
take two years.
   The building, by design consultant Philip Johnson and architect
John Burgee, features a two-story arch at the sidewalk and a
set-back tower.
   Burgee noted that a museum building must be designed as ``a
civic monument, a dignified place ... and it has to be timeless,
because it's forever and ever.''
   The plans include 200-seat and 90-seat theaters; a screening
room and classroom; a radio listening room; a library with card
catalogs of programs and scripts; and galleries.
   The archives already house cassettes of 30,000 programs.
   Radio buffs can hear President Roosevelt's Fireside Chats,
Gracie Allen and George Burns, or Garrison Keillor's Prairie Home
Companion. TV devotees can revel in ``I Love Lucy,'' ``Roots,''
``Cagney and Lacey'' _ or even their favorite commercials.
   About two-thirds of the estimated $45 million cost has been met
_ including Paley's contribution, a $12 million parcel of land.
   The top four floors will be rented out to businesses to help
defray operating costs, said Paley. He said he also will lease the
old museum building as offices once the new one is finished.

   The U.S. Postal Service has turned to a
federal court in an effort to thwart challenges to a contract it
arranged with Texas computer billionaire H. Ross Perot.
   At stake is a potentially multimillion-dollar contract to study
ways to improve postal efficiency.
   The deal is being challenged by would-be competitors who didn't
get to bid. They have asked the General Services Administration's
Board of Contract Appeals to order suspension of the agreement, and
the board complied Thursday, ordering a temporary freeze on the
contract.
   The Postal Service on Wednesday asked the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit to rule that the contract board doesn't
have jurisdiction in the case.
   The Postal Service contends that it is exempt from the federal
procurement law that calls for the GSA to arrange most government
purchases of data processing services and equipment.
   That argument didn't wash with the Board of Contract Appeals,
however, which declined to drop the case on jurisdictional grounds.
   In a separate case last April, the board concluded that it did
have jurisdiction over the Postal Service and said that agency is
indeed bound by the procurement rules.
   Postal officials, insisting that they are not covered by the
law, declined Tuesday to provide documents or individuals to
testify before the board.
   The Postal Service agreed that it did not follow provisions of
the law, saying that that was because it has its own purchasing
rules, which were followed.
   The deal is being challenged by Electronic Data Systems Corp.,
Perot's former company and now a part of General Motors Corp., and
by Planning Research Corp. of McLean, Va.
   The contract is in two phases. The first is a $500,000 agreement
calling for Perot to analyze postal operations and recommend ways
to save money. It was announced June 2 and immediately drew
criticism from a variety of sources.
   After the first 90-day phase, there is to be a second part, in
which Perot would be paid a percentage of any savings the Postal
Service realized from implementing his recommendations for ways of
improving its systems and procedures.
   The Senate, meanwhile, has requested the General Accounting
Office to investigate terms of the deal, and directed the Postal
Service to delay the second phase in the meantime.
