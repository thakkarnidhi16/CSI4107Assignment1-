<HEAD>Heavy Snow In The Central Appalachians</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with Tennessee plane crash,

   Heavy snow fell on the central Appalachians during the morning
Friday, and high wind blowing out of the desert over southern
California fanned brush fires that destroyed homes.
   Up to 10 inches of snow fell in West Virginia, over the Mountain
State's southern mountains and over the coal fields near the
Virginia border. Up to 10 inches also fell across the mountains of
southwestern Virginia.
   In Tennessee, a twin-engine airplane carrying 40 pounds of
cocaine and $7,000 cash crashed into a snowy field outside
Knoxville, killing its pilot and its sole passenger. Police said the
cocaine was valued at $450,000.
   Authorities said heavy wet snow was falling and the ceiling was
down to 400 feet at the time of the crash that killed pilot John
Chestnut, 47, of Trotwood, Ohio; and Jeffery L. Hicks, 23, of
Cincinnati, officials said.
   The plane was en route from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Dayton,
Ohio, with a fuel stop in Knoxville when it apparently lost an
engine, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jack Barker
of Atlanta.
   At least three traffic deaths in Virginia were blamed on slippery
roads. Numerous schools were closed in Virginia and power was out to
thousands of customers in the state's Pulaski, Radford and Giles
counties.
   ``There's just no way we can count the number of accidents
without polling each trooper and seeing how many he investigated,''
said Virginia state police Sgt. G.A. Farthing. ``I'd be hesitant to
even give a number.''
   Rob Yates, a Shenandoah National Park spokesman, said the Skyline
Drive near Winchester, Va., was closed because of heavy snowfall,
and some visitors were stranded at visitor centers along the drive.
   Advisories warned of a chance of snow elsewhere in Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware, eastern Tennessee and West Virginia's Eastern
Panhandle.
   Squalls produced locally heavy snow around the lower Great Lakes
and heavy snow warnings were issued for northeastern Ohio and for
the eastern Lake Ontario counties of New York state.
   Light snow fell around the southern shore of Lake Michigan and
over North Dakota.
   A storm slowly tracking across northern Mexico threatened to
produce heavy snow over parts of New Mexico. A winter storm watch
was posted into Saturday for the state's central highlands,
south-central mountains, and east-central and southeastern plains.
   A snow advisory was issued for parts of western Texas.
   Strong, gusty Santa Ana wind continued to blow across southern
California for a third day with gusts to 60 mph reported at Rialto
and Laguna Peak. More than 20 homes were damaged, some of them
destroyed, northwest of downtown Los Angeles and thousands of people
were evacuated.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered from northern Florida across
the Carolina coast, with light rain and drizzle over the northern
Rockies.
   Afternoon temperatures remained below freezing from northeastern
Montana through the Great Lakes region and much of the Ohio Valley
to the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from zero
degrees at International Falls, Minn., to 83 at Fort Myers, Fla.
Friday morning's official low was 22 degrees below zero at Hibbing,
Minn.
   For Saturday, snow was forecast from the Great Lakes region and
the northern half of the Ohio Valley to northern New England. Rain
was forecast from southeastern Arizona through the southern Plains
and the lower Mississippi Valley to southern Georgia and northern
and central Florida. Snow also was forecast over parts of New Mexico
and northwestern Texas. Scattered showers were forecast from the
coast of Washington to Montana and western Wyoming, with snow at
higher elevations.
   Highs only in the teens or single digits were predicted from the
Dakotas through the Great Lakes to northern New England; in the 20s
in the rest of the region from eastern Montana through the upper
half of the Mississippi Valley to the northern Atlantic Coast; above
50 from coastal Texas to the southern Atlantic Coast and from the
California coast to southern Arizona; above 60 from the central
coast of California to southwestern Arizona; in the 60s and 70s
across the Florida Peninsula; and in the 70s in southwestern
California.

<HEAD>Labor Party Votes to Reopen Talks with Likud Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RONI RABIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAMAT GAN, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's left-leaning Labor Party voted
by an overwhelming majority Thursday to re-enter negotiations with
the hard-line Likud bloc on forming a joint national unity
government.
   The decision was a reversal of the party's 110-member Executive
Bureau, which last week voted against further talks.
   It also was seen as a boost to the leadership of Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres, who pushed hard for a vote in favor of new
negotiations.
   ``If this were not the vote, people would say it was a personal
defeat, so I suppose it's a personal triumph,'' Peres told reporters
after the results were announced.
   The vote of the Central Committee was 637 to 348. Just under
1,000 of the committee's more than 1,300 members attended the
session in this Tel Aviv suburb.
   Both Peres and the party's No. 2 man, Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, made emotional pleas in favor of reopening talks with Likud.
   They pledged, however, that they would agree to join a coalition
government only if it would advance the peace process and was
committed to reforming the electoral system.
   ``For 11 years the Likud has been in power,'' Peres told the
committee. ``Almost all that is dear to us has been affected. What
should we do? Be proud and go home, or try to find a solution and
change the system?''
   He added, virtually screaming into the microphone: ``I did not
come to arrange negotiations, but to examine our souls.''
   Likud first came to power in 1977, and Likud and Labor have
governed Israel in an uneasy coalition since inconclusive elections
in 1984.
   Israeli elections Nov. 1 again ended indecisively, with Likud
winning 40 seats to Labor's 39. The remaining 41 seats were divided
among smaller parties.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Likud has been asked to form a
new government and needs the support of Labor or several of the
smaller parties to achieve a majority in the 120-seat parliament, or
Knesset.
   Intense bargaining has been going on since the election.
   On Thursday, talks were held between Likud leaders and the Tehiya
Party, a nationalist party with three seats in the new parliament,
and a tentative agreement was signed that would give a Tehiya member
the Energy Ministry portfolio, Israel television reported.
   Likud officials also met with three other small parties, but no
agreements were reached, Israel radio said.

   Despite the urging of parole officials,
Governor Buddy Roemer has refused to grant clemency to Wilbert
Rideau, a convicted murderer who became a nationally recognized
prison editor.
   ``I wish somebody would tell me what to do, and I'd do it,''
Rideau said in a telephone interview Thursday, a day after Roemer
rejected the state Pardon Board's recommendation for a reduction of
sentence.
   Rideau, 47, is serving life in the state prison for a 1961 Lake
Charles bank robbery during which he kidnapped three employees, shot
and wounded two of them and killed the third by cutting her throat.
   Rideau was arrested shortly afterwards and confessed in front of
television cameras. He spent 10 years on death row until the U.S.
Supreme Court struck down the state's capital punishment law in 1972.
   The board's second recommendation of reduced sentence would have
made Rideau eligible for parole. In rejecting it, Roemer cited the
strenuous objections of Rideau's prosecutors and victims.
   Rideau, who has won numerous national prizes as editor of the
prison news magazine The Angolite, said he thinks he was turned down
because his success with the magazine has kept him in the limelight.
   ``We've got a system that encourages anonymity. It encourages
prisoners to do nothing, not to distinguish themselves,'' he said.
``If you want to get out of prison, you're supposed to keep your
mouth shut and let everybody forget about you,'' he said.
   Rideau said he is not sure what to do next. Since the pardon
board agreed with him, it would add nothing to get another hearing.
Rideau said he can only hope that Roemer will change his mind.
   ``I would love to meet the man,'' Rideau said. ``I wish I could
sit down with him. Anything he wants to know, let me present my
side.''
   Although serving life, Rideau is frequently on the road,
traveling under guard to lecture at state universities, appear on
national television shows and cover state board meetings for the
magazine.
   He and other editors have been singled out for national
recognition by the American Bar Association, private foundations and
other organizations.

   Pet shop owner Patricia Lopes says she
doesn't mind kissing dogs, but she'd rather not perform
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation again.
   ``All I thought about was what do I do with the tongue,'' Lopes
said Tuesday after reviving a greyhound with cardiopulmonary
resuscitation.
   Lopes, who runs a pet grooming store, said she had just finished
bathing and clipping the toenails of Escape, a 13-year-old retired
racer, when the dog collapsed Saturday.
   She heard a thud and turned to find the dog sprawled out on a pet
table, tongue hanging out and eyes rolled back.
   When she could find no pulse, Lopes said she assumed the dog had
had a heart attack and began CPR _ a procedure designed to restore
normal breathing and heartbeat.
   Lopes pressed on the dog's chest and cupped her hands over the
dog's mouth to breath air into its lungs.
   ``After a few minutes, I heard a cough and then a gurgle. I
continued working on her until she could breathe on her own,'' said
Lopes,
   ``Now it seems funny, doing mouth-to-mouth with a dog. At the
time, though, I was only thinking about how to keep the dog alive,''
she said.
   Lopes said she took a CPR course after a friend developed heart
problems, and it was the first time she put her training to use.
   The dog, owned by Roger Roy of Acushnet, is recovering at home
and is being treated with nitroglycerin, Lopes said. Tests showed
Escape's heart suffered some damage, she said.
   Escape's veterinarian, Ted Sherman of Fairhaven, said it is
difficult to say whether Ms. Lopes' actions saved the dog's life or
whether the heart resumed beating on its own.
   Sherman called Ms. Lopes' response admirable but cautioned
against untrained people performing CPR on animals. He said the best
thing to do is call an animal hospital.

<HEAD>Jerry Lee Lewis Has Little Left, Lawyer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rock 'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis, facing a
$2 million tax debt and other bills, has few personal possessions he
could use to pay off creditors, a bankruptcy lawyer says.
   ``There's not much left,'' Norman Hagemeyer, an attorney
representing Lewis in federal Bankruptcy Court here, said Thursday.
   Lewis, 53, filed for bankruptcy Nov. 8, citing debts of more than
$3 million and income of about $5,000 a month, Hagemeyer said.
   The Internal Revenue Service has been squabbling with Lewis since
1975, and tax agents have seized cars, furniture and other property
from him several times over the years.
   ``There have been at least two sales by the IRS that I know of,''
Hagemeyer said.
   Lewis' bankruptcy petition lists a residence valued at $30,000
near Nesbit, Miss., and other personal property worth about $6,000.
   In a hearing Wednesday, Lewis said the income from an upcoming
movie based on his life would fall well short of his debts.
   Responding to inquiries from bankruptcy trustee George Emerson,
Lewis said a contract he signed eight years ago puts his income from
the movie at $200,000 to $250,000.
   Emerson asked if Lewis expected to perform any consulting work or
other moneymaking activities for the producers of ``Great Balls of
Fire'' starring Dennis Quaid.
   ``No sir,'' Lewis said. ``I've suggested some things. We don't
see eye to eye on some things. They're pretty well set on what they
want to do.''
   The movie about Lewis' tumultuous personal life and the early
years of his rock 'n' roll career is being shot in Memphis.
   In is petition, Lewis listed 22 creditors, but his major debts
are to the IRS and Oklahoma concert promoter who sued in 1978 after
the rocker failed to show up for a scheduled performance, Hagemeyer
said.
   Lewis failed to show up to oppose the lawsuit and a judgment was
filed against him for more than $450,000. With interest, he now owes
about $950,000, the attorney said.
   Lewis went to trial on tax evasion charges in 1984, but was
acquitted of charges he intentionally hid money from the IRS. At the
time, the IRS said he owed the government more than $650,000.
   The singer's income comes primarily from performances, said Jim
Bingham, an attorney representing Lewis on matters other than the
bankruptcy petition.
   Lewis, who recorded such early rock 'n' roll classics as ``Whole
Lotta Shakin' Going On'' and ``Great Balls of Fire,'' told the
bankruptcy trustee he has not received any record royalties in the
last few years.

<HEAD>East Germany Launches Censorship Drive Against Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany, once the Soviet Union's staunchest
ideological ally, has embarked on an unprecedented campaign of
censorship aimed at bridling the spread of the Kremlin's new reform
policies.
   The seriousness of the campaign became clear Nov. 20 when East
Germany's Communist government slapped a first-ever, open-ended ban
on a Soviet publication, a magazine called Sputnik.
   The campaign has pitted East Germany's aging and conservative
leaders in the most dramatic form yet against reformers in the
Soviet Union, whose re-examinations of Soviet history have led to a
public debate on a scale unheard of in East Germany.
   East German leaders have long resisted President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, and other reforms, on
grounds that such critical discussions of problems in East Germany
are unnecessary.
   Recent speeches by Communist Party leaders have reiterated the
government's rejection of the Soviet reforms course.
   However, the recent actions have signaled the boldest moves yet
by the government to distance itself from the debate in Moscow and
to insulate the nation's population from the popular changes.
   Gorbachev's policies enjoy enormous support among East Germans
who hope his influence will bring about change in one of Eastern
Europe's most tightly controlled societies.
   East German party leaders have occasionally blocked the
distribution of newspapers from Warsaw Pact neighbors in the past _
during the 1968 Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia and the early
periods of labor unrest in Poland.
   Selected issues of Soviet magazines have also been blocked. But
until the decision on the monthly magazine Sputnik, no outright ban
had ever been imposed on a Soviet magazine.
   The decision was followed quickly with an order removing five
Soviet films dealing with Stalinist themes from theaters across the
country.
   Authorities also canceled an East Berlin cabaret production that
poked fun at the government's reluctance to accept Gorbachev's
reform policies.
   The banning of Sputnik followed its publication of articles
critical of the late Josef Stalin and Germany's communists before
Adolf Hitler took power in Germany in 1933.
   Stalin, who died in 1953, holds a special place in official East
Germany as a liberator in World War II and as the Soviet leader who
helped found the new communist nation in 1949.
   East German leaders were outraged over an article in Sputnik's
October issue that suggested that Stalin ``had been a mere puppet of
Hitler'' after the two nation's signed a mutual non-aggression pact
in 1939 and that Germany's communists had indirectly aided Hitler's
rise to power by not ``joining together with Social Democrats'' to
stop him.
   The Sputnik article also charged that German communists followed
``Stalin's order to stop all anti-fascist propaganda'' after the
pact was signed.
   Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.
   Distribution of the October Sputnik was ordered halted shortly
after it appeared in East Germany.
   ``These (historical) issues go to the very root of their
(communist East German leaders') existence,'' said Stefan Heym, a
prominent East German author, told The Associated Press in East
Berlin.
   ``These (articles) upset the picture of the world they want to
depict.'
   Erich Honecker, the East German leader, along with a substantial
number of the nation's ruling Politburo members were members of the
prewar German Communist Party and pride themselves on having fought
fascism.
   Honecker was imprisoned by the Nazis and thousands of communists
were slain. Shortcomings of the movement or of party leaders at the
time have not been a matter for debate in the East German media.
   In an article defending the Sputnik ban, the Communist Party
organ Neues Deutschland charged that the publication ``not only
distorts Soviet history, but the history of the German Communist
Party.''
   ``The magazine, and we say this openly, defames German
communists.''
   While carefully emphazing that Sputnik was ``not an official
organ'' of the Soviet Communist Party, Neues Deutchland added that
``distorted visions of Soviet history, distributed here, are
incompatible with our friendship with the Soviet Union.''
   Soviet officials defended the magazine, saying it ``mirrors a
plurality of opinion in the Soviet press.''

Force crashed near Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands, killing all
seven aboard.
   _ Nov. 6, 1986, a Chinook 234, a civilian version of the
helicopter, crashed in the North Sea, killing 45 people. The company
that operated the helicopter said gearbox fatigue probably caused
the crash.
   _ May 13, 1986, a British Army Chinook crashed into a mountain on
West Falkland Island, killing three crewmen. Officials said
visibility was poor at the time.
   _ April 9, 1986, an Army CH-47D collided with an AH-1S Cobra

crew members.
   _ April 21, 1985, a CH-47D taxiing on the ground in Honduras was
destroyed when one rotor stopped turning and was struck by the
other. Eight soldiers were injured, and the Army grounded its fleet
of Chinooks for a month and a half to replace rotor transmission
bearings.

   Marxist guerrillas called the Polisario
Front have been fighting for 13 years for independence of the
Western Sahara, near where two U.S. AID planes came under missile
attack on Thursday.
   Morocco occupied most of the former Spanish Sahara in 1976 after
claiming it as Moroccan since early in the century.
   Algeria immediately recognized the Polisario Front's struggle for
independence, and about 70 nations, mostly members of the
non-aligned group, followed suit.
   Mauritania occupied the southernmost third of the territory in
1976 but gave up its claim to the area in 1979 and Morocco annexed
it.
   The Polisario, with extensive help from Algeria and Libya, waged
an aggressive guerrilla war.
   With a heavily armed guerrilla force of 20,000 men, Polisario
almost captured the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, in 1976,
disrupted phosphate mining at the Sahara mining center of Bou Craa
and attacked shipping off the Atlantic coast with heavily armed
rubber boats.
   Morocco deployed virtually its entire 120,000-member army and
guerrilla activity nearly came to a halt.
   But the operation was expensive in money and lives, and by 1986
Morocco had lost about 15,000 men _ matched by losses on the
Polisario side.
   This year Algeria _ Polisario's main foreign backers _ decided it
had more to gain by reaching a direct understanding with Morocco,
and the United Nations has been mediating peace talks between
Morocco and the guerrillas.
   Under a tentative agreement, about 2,000 U.N. peacekeepers would
monitor a referendum that would result in Western Sahara's
independence or affiliation with Morocco.

   Holiday chimes may sound a somber note for
families grieving over the loss of a child, but a psychiatrist
suggests survivors start new traditions in memory of the departed.
   ``Families in mourning have to be told it is all right to have
fun,'' says Abby L. Wasserman, writing in the December issue of
American Journal of Diseases of Children.
   ``Laughter is the best medicine for helping the bereaved cope
with their loss. Having a good time does not mean that the parents
loved their child any less,'' she said.
   ``In fact, they may be showing more love because by enjoying
themselves, they are bringing their family closer together.''
   In getting through the holidays, families must decide what is
comfortable, Ms. Wasserman said.
   ``Changes can make things less painful,'' she said. ``A different
tree with different decorations. Opening the presents at a different
time. A different menu for dinner.''
   Some families put a small Christmas tree on the child's grave,
Ms. Wasserman said. Others light a candle or order special plants or
flowers.
   Accompanying her article are some ``do's'' and ``don't's'' for
those spending time with bereaved parents during the holidays.
   Do:
   _ Talk about special qualities of the child they have lost.
   _ Allow them to express as much grief as they are feeling.
   _ Reassure them that they did everything they could.
   _ Pay attention to surviving siblings.
   But don't:
   _ Say you know how they feel unless you have lost a child.
   _ Say the parents should be over the loss.
   _ Change the subject when they mention their dead child.
   _ Say they can always have other children.
   _ Point out that at least they have other children.
   Ms. Wasserman, a child psychiatrist at Washington University
School of Medicine in St. Louis, says religion can be a source of
comfort, but she cautions that surviving children might misinterpret
some explanations.
   In one case, she said, the behavior of a 4-year-old boy was poor
after his brother's death.
   ``When asked about this behavior change for the worse, he replied
that he was not going to be so good that Jesus would want him. This
child had been told that his brother was so wonderful that Jesus
wanted him to live with him in heaven,'' Ms. Wasserman said.
   The Compassionate Friends, an international organization
dedicated to helping parents overcome the loss of a child, recently
sent out holiday suggestions to its 600 U.S. chapters.
   ``Sometimes the toughest part of all is the anticipation,'' said
Therese Goodrich, director of group's national office in suburban
Oak Brook.
   ``You turn on the television and people are telling you to get
the shopping done. It's all around us,'' she said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   ``Some people like to buy a gift that their child would have
liked, and then give it to the Salvation Army or a church group.''
   Other suggestions include urging families to change their holiday
routines, mention the loss of their children in Christmas cards and
discuss them when they feel comfortable with the subject.
   Mrs. Goodrich, whose 14-year-old daughter was killed by a car in
1971, says the first holiday without a child is the hardest.
   ``When a child dies, our priorities get shook up. We want to show
a little more love,'' she said. ``I think people just need to be
gentle with themselves. That's the main thing.''

<HEAD>A Mellow Reagan Finds No Reason to Mistrust Gorbachev</HEAD>

   President Reagan, in a twilight assessment,
says Mikhail S. Gorbachev has never shown any reason to be
mistrusted and in fact is steering the Kremlin away from its old
goal of ``a one-world communist state.''
   In what was probably his final White House news conference,
Reagan said ``trust but verify'' remains his byword in dealing with
the Russians, but he offered an optimstic assessment of how
U.S.-Soviet relations stand at the end of his eight-year tenure in
office.
   ``The path remains open and the pace of peace continues,'' he
said.
   For half an hour, Reagan fielded questions Thursday night in an
East Room decorated with Christmas trees hung with silver tinsel. He
said it was the Russians _ not he _ who have changed, but his old
anti-communist fire was dampened.
   On a pressing domestic issue, Reagan said he would be ``deeply
disappointed'' if President-elect Bush, after assuming office next
month, raised taxes to help cut the deficit, which grew to $155
billion this year.
   But he quickly added, ``I don't think it's going to happen.''
   The chief executive also told reporters the United States
ultimately will have to negotiate with Iran to win release of
American hostages in Lebanon. ``We would be ready to talk with
them,'' he said of the Iranians.
   In addition, he said PLO chairman Yasser Arafat did not go far
enough in saying his organization accepts the existence of Israel as
a state and condemns terrorism in all forms.
   ``He has left openings for himself where he can deny that he
meant this or meant that, that sounded so clean-cut,'' Reagan said.
   On a day after his fifth and final meeting with Gorbachev, Reagan
opened the meeting with reporters by reading a warm statement on the
state of superpower relations.
   Asked if he believed Gorbachev was trying to make the Soviet
Union a less threatening nation, Reagan replied without hesitation,
``Yes, I do.
   ``And I think he recognizes that their massive buildup has been
responsible for the great economic crisis that he faces there in the
Soviet Union,'' Reagan said.
   Asked point-blank if he trusted Gorbachev, Reagan said, ``He
hasn't shown me any reason yet that I shouldn't.''
   However, Reagan said the motto ``trust but verify'' is one that
properly guides Soviet policy, too, and said he did not think
Gorbachev ``would gamble on believing that he shouldn't protect his
own interests, also.''
   Whether or not the United States and Soviet Union ever become
allies, as they were during World War II, Reagan said it was
entirely up to the Kremlin.
   It could happen, he said, ``if it can be definitely established
that they no longer are following the expansionist policy that was
instituted in the communist revolution that their goal must be a
one-world communist state.''
   The president said ``certainly there are indications'' the
Kremlin is moving that way.
   ``I do think that there is evidence that they don't like being
the pariah, that they might want to join the family of nations and
join them with the idea of bringing about or establishing peace.''
He said he would like to see that happen.
   Reagan seemed cool to Gorbachev's call for a ceasefire in
Afghanistan, followed by a United Nations-sponsored peacekeeping
force and broad-based government. ``I'm not sure the U.N. would like
that or that the U.N. is prepared to do such a thing,'' Reagan said.
   Moreover, he said it would be unacceptable to stop arming the
Afghan rebels unless the Soviet-backed regime ended military
operations.
   The president said he was ``very grateful'' for Gorbachev's
announcement of a 500,000 cutback in Soviet troop strength but said
Moscow still would have superiority in conventional weapons.
   Reagan also expressed confidence that Bush believed as he does
that Contra forces fighting the government of Nicaragua are freedom
fighters and worthy of continued U.S. support.
   On the subject of American hostages in Lebanon, Reagan said the
United States ultimately would have to negotiate with Iran because
the Iranians control the kidnappers.
   Concerning that prospect, he said, ``There are conditions that
have to be met also there. Anytime that they are ready to come
forward on an open basis, we would be ready to talk to them.''
   ``We cannot enter into negotiating in the sense of what kind of
ransom to pay or you're just encouraging more hostage-taking. But
there are other channels,'' he said.
   Later, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater elaborated: ``We'll be glad to
talk, but we've never been able to get them to do that.''
   Reflecting on the highs and lows of his presidency, Reagan said
his ``greatest burden'' was to have to order troops into ``danger
... to where their lives are threatened, to where their lives are
taken.'' He later expanded that, noting the continued captivity of
hostages in the Middle East.
   His greatest joy, he said without hesitation, was the economic
recovery _ the longest ever during peacetime.
   Fitzwater refused to say the news conference was Reagan's last
one, but Nancy Reagan said it was.

   Taking office nearly eight years ago, President
Reagan said the leaders of the Soviet Union themselves had said they
would ``commit any crime'' to achieve world domination. Now he's
inviting Mikhail Gorbachev to come visit him in California.
   With Reagan fresh from his fifth meeting with Gorbachev in less
than four years, it was inevitable that a reporter at what may be
his last White House news conference would remind him of what he
said about the Soviet leadership at his first one.
   On Jan. 29, 1981, just nine days after he was inaugurated, Reagan
told reporters, ``I know of no leader of the Soviet Union since the
revolution, and including the present leadership, that has not more
than once repeated ... their determination that their goal must be
the promotion of world revolution.''
   Furthermore, he said, the Soviet leaders ``have openly and
publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will
further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right
to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that ... ''
   Thursday night, Reagan's words were different.
   ``That was four leaders back before this one,'' he said. ``I
think there have been some changes.''
   Asked directly whether he trusted Gorbachev, the president said,
``He hasn't shown me any reason yet why I shouldn't.''
   Quickly he added, as he so often does, that his motto is ``trust
everybody, but cut the cards.'' His remarks were sprinkled, however,
with complimentary references to the Soviet leader.
   At the end of his private meeting with Gorbachev on Governors
Island in New York Harbor on Wednesday, Reagan handed the Soviet
leader a photograph with the inscription that they had ``walked a
long way together to clear a path for peace.''
   ``And so we have,'' he told the news conference.
   Reagan never met as president with any of the three other Soviet
leaders who held office and died during his administration _ Leonid
Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko.
   But he has met with Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985, in Reykjavik,
Iceland, in 1986, in Washington in 1987 and both in Moscow and on
Governors Island in 1988.
   He seemed eager to keep in touch, saying the Soviet leader had
invited the Reagans to travel to Moscow and that the Reagans had
reciprocated with an invitation to the Gorbachevs to visit
California.
   The outgoing president and his wife will live in Los Angeles
after his term ends Jan. 20, and say they will also spend time at
their ranch in the Santa Ynez mountains north of Santa Barbara.
Gorbachev has never been to California.
   In the course of superpower summitry during his second term,
Reagan said, there has been a ``serious movement and even some
breakthroughs.''
   He applauded Gorbachev's offer to reduce Soviet troop strength by
half a million troops, but said there was ``still room for
negotiations'' on the subject because the Soviets would retain an
advantage in troops in Europe.
   ``The path remains open and the pace of peace continues,'' the
president said.
   Asked whether he believed Gorbachev was transforming the Soviet
Union into a less threatening nation, he replied, ``Yes, I do.''
   He said Gorbachev's hasty return home, prompted by the
devastating earthquake in Armenia, was ``a sad final note to what
has been an otherwise successful _ and I use the next words
advisedly _ happy and historic visit to the United States.''
   Asked to assess Gorbachev's long-term chances for political
survival, Reagan said: ``Well, I realize, and I think we all should,
that he is battling a bureaucracy, because whether it's a Russian
bureaucracy or one of our own, the first rule of bureaucracy is
protect the bureaucracy.''
   ``And it would mean some great changes for some of the
``Nomenklatura,'' as they call their bureaucracy there, if he
institutes the reforms that he's talking about,'' he continued.
   ``But, on the plus side for him, it's very evident that the
people of the Soviet Union are on his side. And I have to believe
that the Nomenklatura is going to have to think twice with regard to
how far they would go in trying to block him when the man in the
street over there wants the things that have been seen.''

Reagan's news conference Thursday night.

<HEAD>SOVIET UNION</HEAD>

   Reagan said ``extraordinary things'' have occurred in recent
years to improve U.S.-Soviet relations. But he added that the
Soviets would retain conventional troop superiority even if Mikhail
S. Gorbachev makes planned troop reductions.
   The president said he believed Gorbachev was trying to make the
Soviet Union less threatening. Asked whether he trusted the Kremlin
leader, he replied, ``He hasn't shown me any reason yet that I
shouldn't.'' But he quickly reasserted his policy of ``trust but
verify.''
   He said he would someday like to see the United States and Soviet
Union as allies ``if it can be definitely established they no longer
follow expansionist policy.''

   Reagan rejected an assertion that tax cuts he sponsored had
contributed to the federal budget deficit. He blamed anew
congressional spending habits, specifically those of the Democrats,
for the red ink.
   ``We came in inheriting literally deficit spending built into the
structure of government,'' the president.

   Reagan said he would be ``deeply disappointed'' if

   His hardest job as president: ``I don't think there is anything

be taken.''
   He said the economic recovery was the best part of his presidency.

   Reagan said the United States would not unilaterally halt aid to
the U.S.-backed rebels seeking to overthrow the Soviet-sponsored
Kabul regime. He called Gorbachev's proposal for a U.N. peacekeeping
force in Afghanistan an ``exceptional'' proposal but said he was not
certain the U.N. would endorse it.
   The president said the ``puppet government'' would have to step
down for lasting resolution of civil strife.

   The president said PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ``left openings for
himself'' to back away from his statement this week of support of
Israel's right to exist. Reagan reiterated that the Unted States
would enter into dialogue with the PLO chief only ``once it is
clear-cut that he's ready to recognize Israel as a nation.''

   Reflecting on the peaks and valleys of his
presidency, Ronald Reagan said his toughest burden has been sending
young Americans into battle and laboring to win the release of
others held hostage.
   At two different points in his nationally broadcast news
conference Thursday night, Reagan talked of difficult moments in the
Oval Office.
   Asked what task he had found most difficult, the president
quickly cited the sending of troops into combat.
   Saying that ``I think I am prouder of them than of anything that
has happened'' during his nearly eight years in office, Reagan
added: ``I don't think there's anything tougher than to have to
order these magnificent young men and women in our military ... into
danger.''
   ``That's got to be something that any president would hesitate on
and have to say was the greatest burden,'' he said.
   At another point, Reagan cited the continuing captivity of nine
Americans held by pro-Iranian elements in Lebanon, saying it was
``one of those things ... you go to bed with every night.''
   During Reagan's presidency, more than 200 U.S. military personnel
were killed during a bombing of a Marine barracks in Beirut,
Lebanon, several thousand troops were sent into combat during the
invasion of Grenada, in which 19 American soldiers were killed, and
37 crewmen aboard the USS Stark were killed in the Persian Gulf when
their ship was struck by missiles fired by an Iraqi fighter.
   When asked what he most enjoyed about the presidency, Reagan
replied that ``there are a number of things to miss.''
   But Reagan said ``let me simply say one I enjoyed the most is the
economic recovery.''
   ``When I came here, for almost half a century, the debate on the
(Capitol) Hill in the Congress had always been between more big
spending programs, more power for the federal government, more
intervention in private affairs by the federal government, as
against those who were preaching less,'' he said.

<DATELINE>TALMADGE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a return to his home state, Senate
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell visited the only precinct that he
didn't carry in November's election. Judging by the reception, he
might win even its votes the next time around.
   The tiny Bethel Chapel in Talmadge was filled with half again as
many adults as voted in the race. Mitchell lost there, 18-12, but
won in the other 672 precincts, capturing 81 percent of the
statewide vote.
   ``I wanted to head up here and find out what I was doing wrong,''
Mitchell told the gathering in this outpost of rural eastern Maine.
   Mitchell, who followed up his election victory by winning the
three-way majority leader's race last week, had written letters to
Talmadge residents inviting them to the meeting. He was applauded
repeatedly inside the church, a white wooden building surrounded by
a mustard-seed farm, and several people told him they looked forward
to seeing him running for president.
   ``Boy, you'd never know I only got 12 votes, for all that told me
they voted for me,'' Mitchell said.
   Local citizens said they held nothing against the senator, a
Democrat, but that his challenger, Republican Jasper S. Wyman, was
more in tune with the Pentecostal community's beliefs, especially on
abortion. Wyman is the director of the conservative Christian Civic
League of Maine.
   ``Abortion was the issue here,'' said Dawn Coffin, the pastor who
welcomed Mitchell.
   Rev. Coffin, in her introduction, reminded Mitchell that the
success of majority rule in the United States is the ability to
listen to the minority. ``Thank you for listening to a very small
minority here,'' she told him.
   The toughest questions for Mitchell came from Talmadge resident
Walter Heim. He attacked Mitchell, President-elect Bush and others
who don't oppose abortion in all instances as being in the same
league as ``pimps, prostitutes and witches.''
   Mitchell said he opposes federal funding for abortion but was not
against the Supreme Court's ruling which gives women the choice. He
told Heim it was ``regrettable'' that he was associating people of
different viewpoints with scurrilous characters.
   The senator explained that he is a Roman Catholic but, ``I don't
know when life begins.''
   Mitchell fielded questions on local issues and the U.S.-Canada
free-trade pact, which he opposed in the Senate, and afterward
joined the congregation for sandwiches and sweets in a basement
social hall.
   Some of the people apologized for Heim's attack, explaining that
he was not a native of Maine. Heim himself allowed that he was
impressed by Mitchell's visit.
   ``He comes here, exposing his flank,'' said Heim, ``He's quite a
guy.''
   Mitchell chatted with Heim, reporting afterward that another
facet of the encounter had been revealed.
   ``He said, `I was a private and I always wanted to get an
officer. This was my chance','' Mitchell, who was an officer in the
Army Counterintelligence Corps in the mid-1950s, said with a laugh.
   Mitchell said another, older man came up and said, ``Boy, I've
had a lot of politicians come around before the election, but you're
the first one to come around after the election.''

   Ronald Reagan's alma mater, tiny Eureka
College, is sifting through a bonanza of presidential baubles,
including the trademark jellybean jar and a cowboy belt buckle
proclaiming ``the buckaroo stops here.''
   ``President Reagan has a deep affection for Eureka College and
remains consistently in touch with us,'' said George Hearne, the
college's president.
   The school of 460 students about 20 miles east of Peoriairport news
conference, saying the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, ``had extremely grave consequences, devastation and grave
loss of life.''
   Armenian church officials in New York who are in contact with
people in the region said the death toll may be as high as 70,000.
   Although he had only ``one working day'' in New York, Gorbachev
said, ``I and my delegation believe that this was a very important
day.''
   The highlights of the visit were Gorbachev's announcement before
the U.N. General Assembly that he planned a major reduction in
Soviet troop strength over the next three years, and his superpower
luncheon with President Reagan and President-elect Bush.
   Gorbachev, the first Soviet chief to visit New York in 28 years,
said his U.N. speech and a later reception gave him the opportunity
to ``set out our views ... on the world today, and on the prospects
of the world's development.''
   Gorbachev called the Governors Island session with Reagan and
Bush ``a good meeting, held in ... an open and trusting atmosphere.''
   He said the one word he would use to characterize it was
``continuity'' and said all parties walked away, ``confident that
our relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation,
on the basis of mutual respect for each other's interests.''
   Gorbachev later added, ``I think I would be remiss in my duty if
I went home without saying how much we are grateful to New Yorkers,
for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they have been
expressing over these days. So to all New Yorkers, our very warm
gratitude. We value that very much.''
   He had planned to visit the first Soviet trade show in the United
States, Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum on Thursday.
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, canceled a visit with children at an Upper
East Side elementary school.

<HEAD>Attractive New `Aida' At Met</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will stand for PMs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attractive new production of ``Aida'' at the
Metropolitan Opera avoids the visual silliness of the two
productions that arrived before it. This one makes dramatic use of
the stage elevator to change sets.
   The opening night of the new ``Aida,'' a Met Opera Guild benefit,
was tastefully conducted by James Levine and gloriously sung by
Leona Mitchell as Aida, Placido Domingo as Radames, Fiorenza
Cossotto as Amneris, Sherrill Milnes as Aida's father, Amonasro, and
Paul Plishka as the high priest.
   Domingo sounded sterling throughout. He surprised this listener
by taking the optional lower ending, not the high C, at the end of
``Celeste Aida.''
   Miss Mitchell, singing her first Aida at the Met, bloomed into
full vocal glory in the third act. She had longing in her voice in
``O patria mia'' and some beautiful pianissimos. Her voice has
matured marvelously and still has youthful freshness.
   In many operas, the love music is in the first act, before things
start to go wrong. In ``Aida'' the love music is in Act 4, after
things have gone so wrong that Aida and Radames are sealed in a
vault to die. Their duet was so beautiful that the audience didn't
immediately break the spell with huge applause at the end of it.
   Miss Cossotto, who made her Met debut as Amneris in 1968, is a
fine musician, using her voice to brilliant advantage. Her stage
personality, while not flamboyant, is striking, placing Amneris'
royal but hopeless love for Radames in the foreground in the first
two acts. Miss Mitchell's more retiring demeanor put Aida in the
background.
   Milnes was in brilliant voice and form. Amonasro may be a captive
but he's full of vitality and vibrant with plans. Plishka sang with
admirable authority.
   The costumes, by Dada Saligeri, were mostly white trimmed with
gold. Domingo began, a hero, in all gold, and ended, disgraced, in a
dark striped tunic.
   Some scenes were played near the front of the stage, in front of
a wall with huge bas reliefs of two seated Egyptians. Then this
would lift for a scene using more of the stage.
   The most dramatic theatrical stroke is having Amneris' room in
Act 2 sink out of sight. First, soldiers are seen standing on top of
the set that's descending, then a platform for the king and Amneris
is revealed, then all the citizenry _ now joined at ground level by
the soldiers _ wait for the triumphal entry scene.
   In the final scene, the elevator is used again, so the audience
sees Aida and Radames in the vault and Amneris in a temple above
them.
   There is no silly dance in Act 1 while Radames receives his armor
and no fight to the death during the triumphal entry scene. There is
a dance there, by choreographer Rodney Griffin of Philadelphia,
making his Met debut, but it isn't silly.
   Gianni Quaranta, who is Italian and won an Academy Award in 1987
for art direction for ``A Room with a View,'' designed the sets.
Sonja Frisell, a native of Great Britain who was on the staff of La
Scala for 15 years, did stage direction.
   Both, making Met debuts, proved to be stars of the show.

apartment building in West Germany, killing four people, has one of
the best safety records in the Air Force inventory.
   The A-10 Thunderbolt II is an older model ground-attack plane
designed to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude
and to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition.
   The Air Force said the crash was the 14th serious, so-called
Class A accident since Oct. 1, when the current fiscal year began,
although it was the first involving an A-10.
   At the same point in the last fiscal year, the service had
experienced nine Class A accidents.
   Among the 14 accidents recorded since Oct. 1 have been two
involving the new B-1B bomber; one involving a B-52 bomber, and one
involving an F-16 fighter in Spain last Monday that killed the
general in charge of Air Force personnel in the Mediterranean.
   The Air Force says it is impossible to predict what type of
safety record it will post for the year based on little more than
one month's passage. During fiscal 1988, for example, the service
experienced a grim record for its F-16 jet fighter, and yet finished
the year by posting one of its best overall safety records in
history.
   ``Nonetheless, it is true that our mishap rate has suddenly
spiked up and we don't know why,'' said one Air Force official who
asked not to be identified.
   ``We continue to examine our training procedures, maintenance and
everything else.''
   Wednesday's crash involved an A-10 on a training flight that
inexplicably slammed into an apartment building in Remscheid, West
Germany, killing at least four people, injuring dozens of others and
destroying homes for more than a block.
   The A-10 is designed to support soldiers on the ground by
attacking enemy tanks and other high-priority targets. The
Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with the Air
Force in 1977. The plane is no longer in production, but the Air
Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.
   Statistically, the A-10 over time has been the safest fighter or
attack plane currently in the inventory. The aircraft has chalked up
a major accident rate of less than 4 Class A mishaps per 100,000
flying hours over its lifetime _ which now consists of more than
1.75 million flight hours.
   A Class A mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or
damage exceeding $500,000 to an aircraft.
   In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the Air Force lost three
A-10's, for a mishap rate of 1.37 per 100,000 flight hours. By
comparison, the A-7 had a mishap rate of 6.04 per 100,000 flight
hours; the F-16 a rate of 6.80 per 100,000 flight hours, and the
B-52 a rate of 2.04 per 100,000 flight hours.
   The overall Air Force rate for the last fiscal year was 1.63
serious mishaps per 100,000 flying hours _ representing 55 total
accidents _ just slightly worse than the service's all-time best of
1.53 set in fiscal 1986.
   The surge in Air Force accidents over the past month comes at a
time when the other military services continue to report stable
rates.
   The Navy, for example, which enjoyed its safest year ever in
fiscal 1988, is on track toward an even safer year. Since Oct. 1,
the Navy has experienced only four Class A accidents. It recorded 37
in all of fiscal 1988, or more than three per month on average.

   Repatriated Iraqi prisoners of war claim
Iranian officials offered them money and marriage in an effort to
dissuade them from returning to Iraq.
   About 30 prisoners, repatriated for health reasons after the Aug.
20 cease-fire in the Persian Gulf conflict, said many Iraqi
prisoners decided to stay in Iran after such offers were made.
   There was no comment from the International Red Cross on the
allegations, made Wednesday after reporters were driven in
government buses from Baghdad to Mosul's Saddam General Hospital,
where the former prisoners are being treated.
   ``They would tell us, `We will arrange for you to marry a
beautiful Iranian girl, get you a well-paid job, a house and a car,
if you ask for political asylum and stay on in Iran,''' said Osama
Youssef Abdullah, a 29-year-old soldier who was captured in 1981.
   Another recently freed prisoner, Raad Hammoud al-Saiidi, 25, who
said he was captured along with his father and brother while working
on a construction project in a border town in 1980 at the beginning
of the conflict, said:
   ``The mullah (Moslem priest) at the prison kept telling me that
he will arrange for me to marry a beautiful Iranian girl if I stay
in Iran.''

<HEAD>Survey: Tax Changes Taking Bigger Corporate Bite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new survey shows that overhaul of the federal
income tax is increasing the bite on corporations _ which is just
what Congress intended.
   One thousand corporations surveyed by Tax Analysts paid about $7
billion more into the federal treasury last year than they did in
1986, when the tax laws underwent major revisions.
   The 1,000 companies, spread out among 49 industries, paid an
average of 24.72 percent of their earnings in federal income tax in
1987, the study found. That compares with 21.54 percent in 1986 and
20.94 percent the previous year.
   Three out of four corporations paid a higher rate last year than
the year before. While a portion of the increase is due to higher
earnings in 1987, most is attributable to the new tax law, said Tax
Analysts, a Virginia-based research and publishing organization.
   ``Tax reform is working,'' said Forrest D. Marovelli of Tax
Analysts. ``More corporations are paying higher taxes. Fewer are
avoiding taxes.''
   A major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul was to shift a greater
portion of the tax burden from individuals to corporations. Over
five years, the total shift is expected to be about $125 billion.
   The most significant corporate changes enacted were repeal of the
special treatment of capital gains, toughening of the alternative
minimum tax, repeal of the investment tax credit and restructuring
of depreciation allowances. The general corporate tax rate was cut,
from 46 percent to 33 percent, which benefited all companies.
   However, because different types of corporations took advantage
of different provisions under the old tax law, there are significant
variations in how they are faring under the new law, said Mark
Starcher of Tax Analysts.
   For example, a reduction in long-term accounting provisions more
than doubled the average tax rate paid by aerospace companies, from
15.6 percent of earnings to 36.7 percent, the study found. On the
other hand, apparel and furniture companies are paying generally
lower taxes because they have the lower tax rates but lost
relatively little in the other tax changes.
   According to the Tax Analysts calculations, the automobile
industry paid the lowest tax rate last year _ a negative 6.93
percent _ while construction was highest at 58.9 percent. Both
situations were exaggerated by special circumstancs, Marovelli said.
   General Motors Corp., the largest U.S. automaker, had a one-time
tax writeoff that made the entire industry's situation look worse
than it was; without GM, Marovelli said, the industry would have
paid 17 percent.
   The high rate on the construction industry reflected the same
accounting changes that affected the aerospace industry, as well as
a curtailment in use of installment sales, which in the past had
produced a tax savings for that industry.
   Other industry figures from 1987 included: insurance, 14 percent;
paper, 19 percent; drugs, 22.1 percent; banking, 23.6 percent;
railroads, 23.9 percent; petroleum refining, 24.9 percent; lumber,
29.2 percent; textiles, 29.4 percent; services, 31.7 percent;
tobacco, 33.1 percent; apparel, 34.9 percent; commercial printing,
35 percent; newspapers, 36.7 percent; and retail groceries, 37.1
percent.
   Tax Analysts bases its calculations on corporate filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-financed tax research group,
reached similar conclusions in a study of profitable corporations
released in September. That study concluded the number of profitable
companies that paid no federal tax was cut by more than half last
year _ to 16 _ and that the 250 companies surveyed paid an average
of 22.1 percent.

<HEAD>Man Holds Police Hostage With Two Pieces of Beef Jerky</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prisoner being taken to a mental hospital used
two pieces of beef jerky shaped like a gun muzzle to hold a police
chief hostage for about 40 minutes before he was subdued while
praying, authorities said.
   ``He was pretty cunning,'' Cisco Police Chief Billy Rains said
Thursday after the ordeal. ``It felt like a real gun.''
   Rains said he was taken hostage by the prisoner, who had once
been treated as a manic-depressive at the Wichita Falls State
Hospital, Wednesday night in the bathroom of an Austin service
station.
   Rains and Eastland County jail administrator John Blair had
stopped at the service station on their way to Austin State
Hospital, where the 58-year-old prisoner was being committed at the
request of relatives.
   However, the prisoner, who was not handcuffed, got into an
armlock with Rains in the gas station bathroom.
   ``He was trying to grab my gun, and he told me he had a derringer
in my back,'' Rains said.
   But the .22-caliber derringer the man claimed to be holding
turned out to be two rounded pieces of beef jerky, one on top of the
other to simulate a double barrel, covered with a bread wrapper,
Rains said.
   At first, Rains said, he didn't believe the prisoner had a gun.
But then, he said, ``I felt something else in his hand. I couldn't
tell what it was.''
   The man, who works as a truck driver, is a gun enthusiast and
does own a derringer, Rains said.
   Blair rushed to assist Rains after his call for help but was held
at bay by the prisoner, who stood behind the police chief.
   ``We just simply didn't know for sure, and it wasn't the time to
take a gamble,'' Blair said.
   While Blair and Rains attempted to calm the prisoner, an Austin
Police Department hostage negotiator and special mission team were
called to surround the bathroom.
   The man, who was not identified by police, attempted during the
40-minute standoff to convince the officers he did not need to go to
the state hospital.
   ``He was trying to convince us that God was going to cure his
mental illness,'' Blair said.
   Blair and two Austin officers finally subdued the man after he
dropped to his knees and began praying.
   No charges had been filed Thursday against the prisoner, who was
transported to the state hospital after surrendering, an Austin
police spokesman said.
   Rains said he may ask Eastland County District Attorney Bill
Dowell to file charges against the man.
   ``Had he had a real gun, he probably would have shot me in the
back,'' Rains said.

<TEXT>
   An Air Force A-10 fighter crashed Thursday
afternoon near the heart of the Tohono O'Odham Indian Reservation,
but the pilot ejected safely, officials said.
   The plane, based at at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson,
crashed around 3:30 p.m. about 80 miles west of Tucson. The pilot,
identified as Capt. Michael Nutterfield, 29, of Hutchinson, Kan.,
was admitted to the base hospital, said spokeswoman Carol Ann Keck.
   Another A-10 crashed Thursday into an apartment house in
Remscheid, Germany, killing at least four people.
   Despite the coincidence of the accidents, Ms. Keck said the Air
Force would not ground the base's A-10s. The Tactical Air Command
late Thursday released a statement saying that the aircraft would
not be grounded.
   ``I can tell you from this standpoint, we're not tying the two of
them together,'' said the civilian spokeswoman.
   Officials said an investigative board left for the reservation,
whose residents have complained for years about low-flying military
aircraft.
   The pilot was the only occupant of the single-passenger jet, a
unit of the 23rd Tactical Support Group, Capt. Mark Besich said. He
said the aircraft was on a training mission.
   Ms. Keck said the jet crashed near the town of Tracy, about 20
miles northwest of the tribal capital of Sells.
   Reservation residents have complained for years about
low-altitude flights from the Tucson base, which flies many training
missions over sparsely populated southwestern Arizona.
   No one answered the telephone in Tohono O'Odham tribal offices in
several attempts to reach the tribe for comment.

<HEAD>A Long List Of Potential Agriculture Secretaries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The name of Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr is among the
latest to surface on a long list of candidates to be secretary of
agriculture in the Bush administration, according to some farm
organization officials.
   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, once a favorite in the
USDA guessing game, has indicated he will return to the private
sector when President Reagan leaves office next month. Because of
that decision, there does not appear to be a front-runner for the
agriculture post.
   According to one source who demanded anonymity, Yeutter may have
changed his mind after Bush named Carla Hills as White House trade
representative. She is a veteran Washington insider but has little
hands-on agricultural experience.
   But the source said Thursday that Yeutter might be persuaded to
take the USDA and help with agriculture-related issues during
difficult times still ahead in multinational trade negotiations
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   John Lewis, a Washington spokesman for the American Farm Bureau
Federation, said he sees no clear favorite among the dozen or so
names that have been mentioned for the USDA post.
   ``I think the bag is so full now there isn't any more room for
new names,'' Lewis said.
   Among those believed to be in the running are Robert Delano, a
Virginia farmer and former federation president, and Dean Kleckner,
its current chief.
   Asked about the possibility Bush might name a woman to head the
department, which traditionally has had men in all but a few senior
positions, Lewis said he had heard Orr mentioned as a candidate.
   ``It would certainly be a very interesting appointment,'' Lewis
said in a telephone interview. ``In the eyes of some people, it
might even be revolutionary. Personally, I think it would be
refreshing, but I'm not sure it's the time or place. I don't know.''
   A second Nebraska Republican, Rep. Virginia Smith, also has been
mentioned for the USDA post. A seven-term veteran of Congress, Smith
is the ranking GOP member of the House Appropriations subcommittee
for agriculture.
   Cheryl Cook, a spokeswoman for the National Farmers Union here,
said she had not heard either woman mentioned for the job but added,
``We could do a lot worse than either Virginia Smith or Kay Orr,
that's for sure.''
   Cook said she thought Bush's choice would be ``someone who
listens to his boss'' and follows the path set by the 1985 farm law
and Reagan administration policy calling for reduced federal support
for farmers and subsidies for commodity exports at levels below the
cost of production for family farmers.
   Some of those contacted Thursday said Missouri farmer Peter C.
Myers, the current deputy secretary to outgoing Agriculture
Secretary Richard E. Lyng, has come on strong recently as a
potential successor to Lyng and has been gaining support among some
Republicans on Capitol Hill.
   Rep. Tom Coleman, also of Missouri, has been in the running too,
along with former Iowa Rep. Cooper Evans and Seymour Johnson, a
Mississippi soybean farmer.
   The list also includes Rep. Charles Stenholm, a conservative
Texas Democrat who gave President Reagan a helping hand in some of
his early congressional budget battles.
   Another recent addition to the speculation is Wayne D. Angell, a
member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors. Angell, a
Kansan, has a long background in banking and family agriculture.
   Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy, said her favorite would be Yeutter because of what
she termed his ``very strong consumer record.''
   But she added: ``The direction this (Bush) administration will go
is not likely to be pro-consumer. From the trend of the appointments
so far, probably it will be more centrist.''
   Environmental and conservation advocates are sitting well no
matter who Bush puts in charge of USDA, says Robert J. Gray, policy
director for the American Farmland Trust.
   Gray said he would like to see Myers get promoted to the top job
because of his record during the Reagan years as a supporter of
sound conservation policies, including the Conservation Reserve
Program established by Congress in the 1985 farm law.
   That program's goal is to take up to 45 million acres of highly
erodible cropland from production by 1990 and protect it for 10
years by planting grass and trees. More than half the goal has been
met.
   But Gray said he expected the program will be continued
regardless of whom Bush taps to head the department.

<HEAD>Report: Safety Not Considered When Coast Guard Shut Ship Traffic
Centers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard, in deciding to close two of
its largest ship-traffic control centers, failed to consider safety
and environmental factors and incorrectly estimated the cost
savings, a government study has concluded.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
said economics was the main reason for closing the facilities, known
as vessel traffic services, in New York and New Orleans harbors. Yet
because of incomplete recordkeeping, the Coast Guard was not sure
how much money it actually would save.
   ``Because the Coast Guard did not consider such information, it
does not know if it made the correct decision in closing the New
York and New Orleans (facilities), two of the three largest in terms
of vessel activity,'' said the report.
   The GAO said the closings will save about $3.5 million _ mainly
due to lower personnel costs. That is $228,000 more than the Coast
Guard itself had estimated.
   The ship-traffic control facilities are similar to air traffic
control systems. They use a combination of radar, radio and
closed-circuit cameras to monitor vessel traffic in waters where the
possibility of accidents is high.
   The cuts were part of a plan to pare 1,060 military and civilian
jobs nationwide in the Coast Guard and save the government about $48
million. The New York facilities on Governors Island was closed last
July while New Orleans' was decommissioned in March.
   The Coast Guard chose New York and New Orleans because they would
take less time to close and because it ``believed it could close the
New York and New Orleans VTS's with a minimum of (public)
resistance,'' the report said.
   New Orleans is the nation's busiest harbor, handling more than
212,000 vessels in fiscal 1987, while New York is the third busiest,
with traffic of about 157,000 vessels in the same period.
   The report criticized the Coast Guard for failing to consider a
number of relevant factors in the closings, including ``prevention
of accidents and fatalities and protection of the environment
through prevention of oil spills and accidents involving hazardous
cargoes.''
   Although it took issue with the methods used by the Coast Guard
in reaching the closure decision, the GAO did not specifically say
the closures were a mistake.

<HEAD>Jewish Group, Congressmen Criticize US Decision On Soviet Emigres</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish group and a congressman say a Justice
Department decision to allow some Soviet Jews into the United States
under parole status rather than as refugees sends the wrong signal
to Moscow.
   Another Jewish organization, however, said Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's decision Thursday to grant parole status to as many as
2,000 Soviet emigres a month is a welcome step.
   In order to receive refugee status, a person has to show a
well-founded fear of persecution.
   Granting parole instead of refugee status ``sends an incorrect
message that Jews are not being persecuted in the Soviet Union,''
said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee's immigration subcommittee.
   ``By denying refugee status to Soviet Jews, it's prematurely
sending a signal that the situation of Jews in the Soviet Union has
so changed that they're not being persecuted, and that just isn't
so,'' said Karl Zukerman, executive vice president of the Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society.
   Zukerman said those rejected for refugee status are subjected to
persecution that is ``indistinguishable from those accepted'' into
the United States.
   The Reagan administration last summer stopped granting automatic
political refugee status to Soviet Jews and other Soviet citizens.
It said budget concerns were largely responsible for the change.
   Those paroled into the United States must pay their own way,
while transportation and resettlement costs for refugees are paid in
part by the government.
   The State Department told the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society that
it will have about $27 million available during fiscal 1989 to pay
for transporting only 12,000 Soviet Jews, said Zukerman.
   Being paroled into the country is less desirable than being a
refugee because it doesn't entitle an immigrant to become a legal
resident or to seek U.S. citizenship.
   Jewish organizations say 173 Soviet Jews have been denied refugee
status by U.S. officials in Rome since September. The organizations
also say a growing number of other Jews seeking visas from the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow have been told to expect delays of a year or more.
   To relieve some of the pressure, Thornburgh said he would parole
up to 2,000 Soviet emigres a month into the United States.
   Thornburgh also ordered Immigration and Naturalization Service
Commissioner Alan Nelson to temporarily transfer a Russian-speaking
INS officer to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to handle refugee
applications, rather than waiting until early January when the
quarterly process normally begins.
   Thornburgh's announcement and especially his order to resume
processing refugees in Moscow ``is a welcome signal,'' said a
statement issued by the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.
``Protests concerning the recent treatment of Soviet Jews'' by the
INS ``are finally being addressed.''
   The group said, however, that ``without further clarification ...
his response is inadequate. ... granting parole status ... ignores
U.S. human rights policy and the long history of Soviet anti-Semitic
repression of Jews.''
   Thornburgh also said he has asked ``as part of a longer-term
solution'' that the Justice Department's Office of Legislative
Affairs work with the State Department in developing a legislative
proposal to resolve the problem.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan, defending the U.S. refusal to
allow PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to speak to the United Nations in
New York, says the Arab leader hasn't yet clearly recognized Israel.
   ``We are willing to meet with him, and talk with him, and I'm
sure the Israelis would be, when once and for all it is clear-cut
that he is ready to recognize Israel's right to be a nation,''
Reagan said Thursday in a nationally televised news conference.
   The president said Arafat's statement Wednesday in Stockholm _
that the Palestine Liberation Organization accepts Israel and
rejects terrorism ``in all its forms'' _ was ambiguous.
   ``He has left openings for himself where he can deny that he
meant this or meant that, that sounded so clean-cut,'' Reagan said.
``... You could quote to him, `Oh you said this,' but he's still in
a position to say, `Well yes, but wait a minute. I also said this.'
And then you find that the second `this' kind of reduces or
nullifies the first `this.'''
   The United States has said it will not deal directly with the PLO
until it explicitly recognizes Israel's right to exist and renounces
terrorism.
   In a Nov. 15 declaration in Algeria, the PLO's parliament did not
specifically recognize Israel's right to exist, although it accepted
three U.N. resolutions that do so.
   And, it did not directly renounce terrorism, although it commited
the PLO to the ``Cairo declaration'' of 1985, which limits attacks
to ``military targets'' in Israel.
   Israel has rejected the Nov. 15 declaration by the Palestine
National Council as ``doubletalk.''

   President Reagan says the United States
eventually will have to negotiate with Iran to gain the release of
American hostages held in Lebanon, but insisted the U.S. government
would not consider paying any kind of ransom.
   ``We're looking at every channel that we can find to try and get
them, and I imagine that the ultimate is going to have to be somehow
a negotiation with Iran, because they have control of those
people,'' he told a news conference Thursday.
   ``We are hopeful that there can be avenues that would open'' for
the release of the hostages, he said. ``We cannot enter into
negotiating in the sense of what kind of ransom to pay, or you are
just encouraging more hostage-taking.''
   And in perhaps his last White House news conference, Reagan
repeated that he did not believe his administration was bargaining
with terrorists when it entered into the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``We were not negotiating with them in the so-called Iran-Contra
affair at all. We were heeding a plea from some individuals ... And
these people were among those who were planning ahead to have a
government'' after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Khomeini remains the spiritual head of Iran.
   Reagan said he would be willing to negotiate with Tehran, with
which Washington has had no formal diplomatic ties since the 1979-81
hostage crisis.
   ``There are conditions that have to be met also there. Anytime
that they are ready to come forward on an open basis, we would be
ready to talk to them,'' Reagan said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking to reporters
immediately after the news conference, said Reagan was not referring
to any new circumstances under which the United States would
negotiate with Iran, saying the terms that Reagan alluded to ``are
the same conditions that we've been talking about all along.''
   ``We have said that there would have to be authoritative
representatives of the government of Iran'' to negotiate with and
that ``they would have to acknowledge this publicly,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``We'll be glad to talk, but we've never been able to get them to
do that,'' the spokesman said.
   Fitzwater said that releasing U.S. hostages held captive in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian elements was not a precondition to
discussions with Tehran.
   Anita Stockman, a State Department spokeswoman, also said that
the administration ``has always maintained that we are prepared to
talk with the Iranians if it is somebody that is serious and
somebody in authority.''
   ``We have extended an invitation to meet in a serious setting,
and have not gotten any response to that,'' she said. ``We have
maintained all along that any one with influence with the
kidnappers, and that includes the Iranians, should use it to win
their freedom.''
   The State Department's Office for Counter-Terrorism says that as
of Oct. 5, 1988, 15 foreign hostages remain in Lebanon _ nine
Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian.

   Here is the transcript of President Reagan's
news conference Thursday night.
   PRESIDENT REAGAN: We've got to stop meeting like this. Well, as
most of you know, President Gorbachev has had to return to the
Soviet Union due to the enormity of the tragedy in Armenia. And in a
phone conversation this morning, I conveyed to him the deep sympathy
of the American people and our anxiousness to provide any
humanitarian assistance we possibly can.
   The nature of President Gorbachev's departure is unfortunate and
provides a sad final note to what has been an otherwise successful _
and I use the next words advisedly _ happy and historic visit to the
United States.
   It was in this spirit that yesterday at lunch I presented Mr.
Gorbachev a memento of our first meeting _ an inscribed photo of the
walk we took together in Geneva in 1985. The inscription read
simply: ``We have walked a long way together to clear a path for
peace.''
   And so we have. It was exactly one year ago today that an event
here in this room spoke to the epoch-making nature of what has been
achieved _ the signing of the first treaty to eliminate an entire
class of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles.
   Even in the short year since then we've had the Moscow summit and
Mr. Gorbachev's visit here. In our negotiating agenda of regional
conflicts, human rights, bilateral exchanges and arms reductions,
we've seen a serious movement and even some breakthroughs. And
yesterday's address to the United Nations by President Gorbachev was
not only a part of this process, it was the result of this process,
and I congratulate him on it.
   On a personal note, Nancy and I were delighted that the
Gorbachevs extended an invitation for us to visit Moscow. And as we
have done before, each of us expressed the hope that they would
visit us in California.
   So the path remains open and the pace of peace continues. As I
said yesterday, this means our responsibilities have grown not less
but more serious. We must remain resolute and without illusion, and
we must speak candidly about fundamental points of difference. We
must especially maintain our military strength. But we must also
continue our course of vigorous diplomatic engagement.
   I cannot tonight attempt to put all these events in perspective,
or still less, to claim credit for any person or administration. Let
it be enough to say this, that since 1985, extraordinary things have
happened, and nothing more extraordinary than the sight yesterday of
a president of the United States, and a future president of the
United States, and a president of the Soviet Union, standing
together in New York Harbor under the protective gaze of the Statue
of Liberty.
   Our hope, our prayer, remains the same as that heard on the lips
of so many millions who looked up once, as we did yesterday, to see
the outstretched lamp of liberty, and who felt for the first time
its warmth and glow, a prayer that someday freedom will light the
world and become the blessing and birthright of every people
everywhere.
   And Helen, you have the first question.

<HEAD>WASHN: first question.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   QUESTION: The world is applauding the initiative that _ the new
detente that you and President Gorbachev have initiated. But on the
debit side, as you leave office, the nation is saddled with a $2.6
trillion debt, an enormous deficit, caused perhaps by the tripling
of military spending and tax cuts. How does all this jibe with the
goals that you set eight years ago? And I'd like to follow up.
   ANSWER: Helen, I have to tell you, it is incorrect to say that
all of this happened because we cut taxes, and the things that have
happened in these last few years. I have said many times, and
pointed out, that over 58 years, in which the opposing party held
the House of Representatives 54 of those 58 years, and in those
years there were only eight scattered years in which there was a
balanced budget.
   And I was among a great chorus, out on the hustings, speaking out
against this consistent and constant deficit spending. And each
time, the answer came back that it was necessary to maintain
prosperity, and the other part of the answer was, and it's
meaningless, ``Because we owe it to ourselves.'' Now, beginning in
1965, in the middle '60s, when the _ when President Johnson's
program of the War on Poverty was put in place, in the 15 years from
then until 1980, the budget increased just about five times what it
had been 15 years before, and the deficit increased to 58 times what
it had been. So, we came in inheriting literally deficit spending
built into the structure of government.
   Now, with regard to the tax cuts, yes, the rates were cut. But
since 1981, our revenue from those taxes has increased by $375
billion. And our projection _ and we've been very accurate on our
projections _ our projection for 1990 and the budget we're working
on now calls for another $80 billion increase in our revenues with
the rates as they presently are.
   If you look back beyond us to Coolidge and his tax cuts, if
you'll look to the Kennedy tax cut in his administration, which was
very similar to the one that we later put in, in every case it did
not reduce the government revenues; it raised them. So, it is
maintaining this and continuing to get back to a reduced spending
because the spending increase, while the revenue was increasing $375
billion, the spending increase was close to $100 billion more than
that increase in revenues.
   Q: Mr. President, some of your former associates claim that you
deliberately created a larger deficit in order to dismantle the
compassionate social programs for the poor, the sick, the needy, the
handicapped, the elderly, which you didn't like. Is that true?
   A: No, Helen, it is not true, and that is, I guess, political
propaganda also. Actually, the reductions that we have made have not
been made in the actual basic spending. I have cut the increases
that were asked for, but also, we have taken action to vastly
improve the business management of government. When I came here,
there was a program, one program _ I found out about it when I was
governor _ a program in which the administrative overhead was so
great that it cost $2 to deliver $1 to a needy person.
   Now, this is the thing _ one of the things that we've been trying
to correct. But actually, there has been an ongoing increase in
college _ the aid to college students, there has been an ongoing
increase in housing with all of the talk about the need for housing
_ that has been increased _ and I could go on about all the other
programs that they have. We've simply tried to keep the increase
from being as much as was being asked for. And actually, our defense
spending and what we asked for, regardless of the cuts that were
then made in it, the ones that I asked for, the annual budgets for
defense, were less than the projected budgets necessary for defense
for five years, the five years that President Carter had projected
ahead of what was going to be needed for defense, and he projected
more than we asked for.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, Mr. Gorbachev yesterday announced a major
cutback in Soviet troop strength and he talked generally about
nations relying less on military might. Do you think that Mr.
Gorbachev is trying to remake the Soviet Union into a less
threatening country?
   A: Yes, I do. And I think he recognizes that their massive
buildup has been responsible for the great economic crisis that he
faces there in the Soviet Union. And yes, he has proposed this, but,
even so, there still will be room for some negotiations on arms
because this still leaves them with a superiority in the amount of
conventional weapons that they have.
   Q: Mr. President, if I may follow up. Aside from the conventional
forces, where the Soviets do retain this advantage, is there an area
where the United States might be able to make a unilateral cutback
in arms itself?
   A: Well, we're still way below them in that. But we have
announced our willingness to continue and to _ well, before he ever
made this move. And we're very grateful for this. I appreciate it
very much. But we have proposed that the next negotiations with
regard to military, and between us, should be in the area of
conventional weapons.
   Q: Mr. President, George Bush has been receiving advice on all
fronts, it seems, to raise taxes. I wondered if you think he can
hold the line and not raise taxes for a full four years? And if he
should cave in and raise them, would you be deeply disappointed in
him?
   A: Yeah, I would be deeply disappointed. And I don't think it's
going to happen, because I think he is aware, as I am, that rates
reduced actually increase the economic growth of the country and
provide an incentive for more earnings. Today, the top 5 percent of
earners _ when I hear these people start talking about the upper
levels of income _ the top 5 percent of earners in this country, at
this much lower rate of taxation, are paying a bigger share of the
total revenue from the income tax than they were paying before at
the higher rates, because there's now an incentive to go out and not
look for tax shelters and so forth.
   Q: Sir, if I could follow up. Do you really feel it's possible
simply to grow out of the deficit? Or, is it necessary, if you're
not going to raise taxes, to cut Social Security benefits and
Medicare benefits?

<HEAD>WASHN: Medicare benefits?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A: We don't have to touch Social Security, and we don't have to
have taxes. We have _ as I've said, we are _ we're on a line right
now, that is bringing the deficit down. There was no way anyone
could ever pull the rug out and have the deficit solved in one year.
But the deficit will be reduced down under the Gramm-Rudman scale
that we're following to $100 billion. And by 1993, the budget will
be balanced if we continue observing this thing.
   Andrea?
   Q: Mr. President, this is your final news conference with us, you
say?. And, at your first news conference, you said that the Soviets
would commit any crime, would lie, would cheat, would steal to
achieve their political goals. Now, tonight, you are celebrating
your joint progress with President Gorbachev and celebrating a
speech in which he renounced the use of force by the Soviet Union to
achieve foreign policy goals. Do you think that he has really
changed? And to the extent that he has changed, have you changed?
What have you learned over these eight years that may have changed
your view of the Soviet system?
   A: I know so many of you quoted this in that first press
conference of mine, and Sam, I think it was your question.
   Q: She stole my question.
   A: Yes. But, none of you ever thought to give the complete
answer. I said, in their own words, this was their philosophy, and
it was in writing that there was no crime. All of these things were
not a crime if they advanced the cause of socialism. Now, I didn't
make that up. That's what they said. I think there's been a change.
That was four leaders back before this one. And I think there have
been some changes. I _ one, we just talked about earlier, of his cut
in armaments.
   Q: Mr. President, to follow up, what about the changes in your
own thinking? Granted that they have changed and that Mr. Gorbachev
is a very different kind of Soviet leader, but do you think in any
way that your previous views might have been rigid or poorly formed?
   A: Well, Andrea, there were differences in these leaders. And
there is a situation now where many of the things that they've
preached have been proven unsound and that's why their economy is in
such great trouble. But, I must say, I have never met with one of
those leaders that was comparable to this man or had the approach
that he has. But, he knows that I feel that that _ well, we put it
this way, as I've said, my philosophy is, trust everybody, but cut
the cards.
   Q: I was going to ask that, but let me just now ask you, what's
the toughest thing that you've had in your job? What's been the
toughest part of these eight years? And I have a follow-up.
   A: (Laughter) You realize how much time you're stealing with
these follow-ups, away from others that want to ask a question?
Well, there _
   Q: Yeah. Yeah.
   A: I think there have been many tough things. I don't think
there's anything tougher than to have to order these magnificent
young men and women in our military today _ and I think I'm prouder
of them than of anything that has happened _ to have to send them
into danger, to order them to go some place where their lives are
threatened and their lives are taken. That's got to be something
that any president would hesitate on, and I have to say was the
greatest burden.

<TEXT>
   Q: All right, let me ask the other side then. What have you
enjoyed most? What is the thing you're going to miss the most?
   A: Well there are a number of things to miss, but let me _ I
don't want to get into a lecture here. Let me just simply say on
enjoyed the most is the economic recovery. When I came here, for
almost half a century, the debate on the hill in the Congress had
always been between more big spending programs, more power for the
federal government, more intervention in private affairs by the
federal government as against those who were preaching less.
   Well now today and for a long time, the very question that was
asked here about the deficit, the argument on the hill today is not
more spending. The argument is how best can we reduce the deficit.
   Q: Comment personally, sir. I mean, personally as president.
   A: Well, I appreciate very much the fact of being a party to this
economic recovery. We were in a disaster situation when we came here.
   Trude.
   Q: Mr. President, until recently, the United States has been
reluctant for the Soviet Union to play a significant role in the
Middle East. But now with Mr. Gorbachev's new cooperation or
openness, how do you suppose you could use him to expedite the peace
process?
   A: Well I think that once again, here we're going to have to see
whether this is still acceptable to the parties that are to be
involved in the direct negotiations. Actually we talk an
international gathering or something, but the Middle East, which is
still technically in a state of war, that must be resolved between
the nations of the Middle East in direct negotiations. And if we can
help bring that about, then I would welcome anyone who wants to help.
   Q: In light of his speech yesterday at the U.N., are there any
new steps that we can take to reduce the _ to continue the arms
reduction process?
   A: Oh, yes. I _ we have long said that as soon as we once settle
this issue of the START agreement, I have said that I think our next
goal must be to now engage in negotiations on reducing conventional
weapons.
   Q: Mr. President, one question and no follow-ups. (Laughter.)
   A: This man deserves a hand. (Laughter.)
   Q: Now that you're leaving the White House, or will soon, what is
going to become of the Contras, the resistance forces in Nicaragua,
without you here as their champion? And do you have a commitment
from President-elect Bush to carry on the same policy line that you
have for supporting the Nicaraguan resistance?
   A: Jerry, obviously I do not try to pin him down. He is the
president-elect and he will be the president when he takes over. But
I do believe, knowing him and what he _ and our association together
for all these years, I believe that he agrees with me that the
Contras are freedom fighters, and they are trying to achieve
democracy in their country, which is now a communist totalitarian
government.

   Q: Mr. President, you've made a career lately of using an old
Russian proverb, ``trust but verify.'' But given that verification
can never be 100 percent science, given that there are always a few
percentage points where you just can't be sure, do you trust General
Secretary Gorbachev for those few points?
   A: Well, I've said _ right now, with regard to the INF treaty, we
have worked out verification provisions that are greater than
anything that has ever been done before between us. And I think that
there is a reasonable chance that _ a very reasonable chance _ that
we can continue to have that kind of verification.
   One of the first things that I talked over with Mr. Gorbachev in
Geneva when we first met was that I said to him, we both didn't have
great military _ (pauses) _ well, how did I say it? (chuckles) _ put
it that we _ that we didn't mistrust each other because of our great
military; we had our military because we mistrusted each other, and
that our negotiations should be aimed at removing the causes of
mistrust. And I have to say, it's pretty much followed that pattern.
   Q: Well, what I want to know is do you trust Gorbachev?
   A: He hasn't shown me any reason yet that I shouldn't. But,
again, as I've said, that's why I kept referring to ``doveryai, no
proveryai,'' trust but verify, and he knows that. And that's _
neither one of us I don't _ I don't think that he would gamble on
believing that he shouldn't protect his own interests also.
   Q: Mr. President, at your meeting with Mr. Gorbachev yesterday,
you toasted the things that he and Vice President Bush will
accomplish. You spoke this evening about the grave economic crisis
that Mr. Gorbachev faces. What is the U.S. assessment of his
long-term chances for political survival?
   A: Well, I realize, and I think we all should, that he is
battling a bureaucracy, because whether it's a Russian bureaucracy
or one of our own, the first rule of bureaucracy is protect the
bureaucracy. And it would mean some great changes for some of the
``Nomenklatura,'' as they call their bureaucracy there, if he
institutes the reforms that he's talking about. But, on the plus
side for him, it's very evident that the people of the Soviet Union
are on his side. They want this _ this perestroika and this glasnost
that he has talked about _ very much. And I have to believe that the
nomenklatura is going to have to think twice with regard to how far
they would go in trying to block him when the man in the street over
there wants the things that have been seen.
   Let me go over here for a minute. I've been kind of one-sided.
   Q: Mr. President, you could help Mr. Gorbachev in clearing up a
domestic political problem, that is, Afghanistan _ how to pull out
of there with honor. He suggested at the U.N. yesterday, an in-place
cease-fire, a cessation of outside military aid. Some people think
this could lead to a partition of Afghanistan. What's wrong with
that? It would save lives; it would help Mr. Gorbachev?

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Mr. Gorbachev?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A: Well, there's one thing, if we're talking about disarming the
Mujahadeen, remember that there is still a military force in
Afghanistan that was organized by the puppet government established
by the Soviet Union. And they are a force that has been fighting,
along with the Soviet, and side by side against the Mujahadeen. If
you want to get around to disarming both sides, you can't suddenly
disarm the Mujahadeen and leave them at the mercy of this already
military management.
   Q: But Mr. Gorbachev proposed at the U.N. yesterday, sending in a
U.N. peacekeeping force just to do this.
   A: Well, you'd have to take up with the U.N. I _ this is
something rather exceptional that he's asking on that, and I'm not
sure that the U.N. would like that, or that the U.N. is prepared to
do such a thing.
   Q: What would you like?
   A: I think that the _ we've got to recognize that if the Afghan
people are going to be able to state and create the government they
want, then that puppet government has got to be ready and willing to
step down, and not have some kind of a compromise thing in which it
remains as a government with _ compromising with the others. Let's
let them start from scratch and build the government they want.
   Q: Mr. President, let me bring you back to the Middle East.
You've got very little time left, and Mr. Arafat, of the PLO, seems
to be inching towards the kind of conditions you and Mr. Shultz have
said he should. Isn't this perhaps not time to go the inch in his
direction and start some kind of talks with Mr. Arafat, rather than,
as Mr. Shultz did, close the door on him?
   A: No, we've been watching very closely. And for example, we've
thought in the last few days that there was a statement that came
out of that meeting in Sweden, that appeared to be clean-cut and not
with the things around the edge that then diffused what seemed to be
a pledge. But we had to wait until his press conference and what he
said. And I have to say that, again, he has left openings for
himself where he can deny that he meant this or meant that, that
sounded so clean-cut. It's up to him. We are willing to meet with
him, and talk with him, and I'm sure the Israelis would be, when
once and for all it is clear-cut that he is ready to recognize
Israel's right to be a nation, that he is ready to negotiate on
behalf of the Palestinian people for a homeland for them, and so
forth. And this is all.
   Now, the thing about George Shultz's decision _ I'd like to call
to your attention, there is a law, passed by the Congress, with
regard to the conditions for granting a waiver to someone to come in
and meet with the United Nations, or participate in what they're
doing. And there is no way under that law that Mr. Arafat qualifies
as yet. And the day that he does, and it is clear-cut, then he _ we
can grant that visa. But as I say, he is barred by the terms of that
law, and the only way that the _ and the secretary of state has full
power under that law. It's his decision to make. And he can only
grant a waiver if an individual meets certain requirements, and
Arafat doesn't.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: Arafat doesn't.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Well, to follow up and be just as clear-cut, did he not, in
his statement, say that he accepts the U.N. articles and that he
recognizes Israel? What is the fine line that he hasn't crossed?
   A: What we're still analyzing is, then, as he went on, other
things in which it's a case, and this has happened before, certainly
with the same individual _ you could quote to him, oh you said this,
but he's still in a position to say, well yes, but wait a minute, I
also said this. And then you find that the second ``this'' kind of
reduces or nullifies the first ``this.''
   Q: In your opening statement, you made reference to our military
strength. Sir, a principal element of this nation's strength is our
nuclear deterrent, and during your administration, sir, numerous
nuclear production plants have been allowed to decay, including
plants that produce plutonium and tritium. Sir, what have you
directed your aides to do about the problem, and how serious is the
threat, particularly since there are plants now in Colorado and
South Carolina which have not been allowed to reopen due to safety
problems?
   A: And we have made it very plain that we will not allow those
plants to reopen until they meet the requirements and constitute no
danger to the citizens of this country. And that it just has to be
that cold turkey. Now I don't think that we can be blamed for the
deterioration that certainly began long before we were here.
   Q: Mr. President, if I could follow up, isn't it true that you
have left President-elect Bush a tremendous financial and national
security challenge, not only in getting these plants back in
operating order, but also in devising ways that we can dispose of
our nuclear waste?
   A: No, we are working on that and we have been, and we've made
more progress than I think we're given credit for on that, and he'll
have to continue. We're doing those things, and I don't think that
the problems are all money.
   Bill?
   Q: Mr. President, do you have any reason to believe that the
American hostages, who are still being held in the Middle East, will
be released after you leave office?
   A: I don't think that anyone that takes over this office is going
to give in, nor did I. It is, that is again one of those things _ I
should have said to your question, Bill, that it, that you go to bed
with every night. And, we are hopeful that there can be avenues that
would open. We cannot enter into negotiating in the sense of what
kind of ransom to pay or you're just encouraging more
hostage-taking. But there are other channels. We're not advocating
that any individual, as some have, take it upon themselves to try to
get them out. But we're looking at every channel that we can find to
try and get them. And I imagine that the ultimate is going to have
to be somehow a negotiation with Iran, because they have control of
those people.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: those people.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: So, you would be willing to do this negotiation with Iran,
sir, is that right? Either now or before you leave office or after
Mr. Bush takes over? You are willing to negotiate with Iran over the
hostages?
   A: There have got to be some changes there too. We were not
negotiating with them on the so-called Iran-Contra affair, at all.
We were heeding a plea from some individuals. At that time, all of
you were kind of heralding the day, in the media, that was going to
come within a week that the ayatollah would no longer be the head of
government because of his health, and these people were among those
who were planning ahead to have a government.
   Q: Are you going to do it now?
   A: What?
   Q: Are you going to do it now, sir?
   A: There are things _ conditions that have to be met also there.
Any time that they are ready to come forward on an open basis, we
would be ready to talk to them.
   Q: The United States and the Soviet Union were once allies during
World War II. Do you see that the beginning that have been made here
with you and Mr. Gorbachev, resulting in a situation where we would
once more count the Soviet Union as an ally and have a free and open
trade with them on a large-scale basis?
   A: I think that is all dependent on them. If it can be definitely
established that they no longer are following the expansionist
policy of, that was instituted in the Communist revolution, that
their goal must be a one-world communist state. Now, if that has
definitely been given up, and certainly there are indications that
we could see that we can anticipate bringing such a thing about,
then I do think that there is evidence that they don't like being
the pariah, that they might want to join the family of nations and
join them with the idea of bringing about or establishing peace.
   Q: Is that something you want, sir?
   A: Yes. One of the first things that I ever told him when we met,
I said, ``There are two of us here in this room, just two men.'' And
I said, ``We _ it's a unique situation. Between us, we have the
power to start World War III. Or, between us, we have the power to
bring peace to the world, a lasting peace.'' And apparently, we've
been working in that direction.
   Q: Mr. President, if the Soviet Union makes good on it, and does
reduce U.S. (sic) troop strength, there's talk on Capitol Hill that
perhaps the U.S. can follow suit and in the process, reduce our
defense spending and make an impact on the budget deficit. Do you
foresee that as a realistic possibility?
   A: No, if I've _ I guess I wasn't switching signals here fast
enough at the very beginning of this. Are you suggesting that the
defense spending is _
   Q: If Soviet troop posture leads to some cuts on our own and that
this would help to reduce the deficit. People are already looking,
some Democrats, thinking that this may help us to reduce the deficit.
   A: Well, once again, I must repeat, that can't happen with our
defense spending until we have reached a parity and at which then
both sides can continue the reduction of weapons and keeping it at a
parity. But, that is not true today. They _ the dropping of 500,000
military personnel still leaves them with five million under arms.
They have _ they still outnumber us in tanks and artillery weapons
after they make these cuts. So, we haven't achieved parity, but at
least, if he goes through with that and succeeds in that, he is
going to bring it down to a range where I think that he would see
that we could proceed and continue, then mutually reducing arms
between each other.
   THE PRESS: Thank you, Mr. President. Merry Christmas.
   THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Merry Christmas to you all.

   The U.S. dollar dropped Friday against the Japanese
yen, while share prices edged up on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed the week at 122.43 yen, down 0.59 yen from
Thursday's closing of 123.02 yen. After opening at 122.20 yen, the
U.S. currency ranged between 122.10 and 122.47 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues finished the day's trading at 29,793.42, gaining 34.52 points
or 0.12 percent. The index lost ground shortly after the market
opened but then reversed directions.
   The dollar surged against other major currencies earlier this
week on speculation that talks between U.S. and Soviet leaders might
lead to bilateral arms reductions which could help reduce the U.S.
budget deficit.
   The dollar fell Friday mainly because investors were disappointed
by the still unclear U.S. reaction to Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's pledge to unilaterally reduce Soviet troops by 500,000,
said a Bank of Tokyo dealer.
   On the stock exchange, share prices were slightly lower following
a 11.92-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall
Street overnight, equity dealers said.
   Investors withdrew to the sidelines to follow the case involving
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and his alleged involvement in a
stock dealing scandal.

   Baroness Philippine de Rothschild unveiled
a painting of three masks and a moon that will adorn thousands of
bottles of the renowned French wine that bears her family's famous
name.
   With Thursday's unveiling, Haitian artist Bernard Sejourne joined
the likes of Pablo Picasso, Salvadore Dali, Andy Warhol and Joan
Miro, who have all painted labels for Chateau Mouton Rothschild
since 1945.
   Sejourne's work will be used for the 1986 vintage of the Bordeaux
wine, which will be bottled beginning this month.
   The baroness made the announcement at a news conference opening
an exhibition at the Memorial Art Gallery of Chateau Mouton
Rothschild labels and artwork. The show has been touring the world
since 1981.
   Asked if she had a favorite among the dozens of paintings, the
daughter of the late Baron Philippe Rothschild said the latest one
is always her favorite.
   Sejourne, a 41-year-old painter and sculptor, will be paid for
his painting in wine.

   The Sands Hotel & Casino shuffled its
plans to have Iran-Contra figure Oliver North address gamblers after
a state assemblyman blasted it for retaining North while he was
under indictment.
   ``We have deferred Lt. Col. North's appearance here pending the
resolution of the charges against him,'' Roberto Rivera-Soto, Sands
vice president and general counsel, said Wednesday.
   The Sands announced last week that it had reached an agreement to
have North speak before a select group of casino customers Feb. 11.
   The retired Marine officer, once called a national hero by
President Reagan, faces 16 counts of an indictment for his role in
the diversion of profits from the sale of arms to Iran to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Assemblyman Dennis Riley on Tuesday criticized North's scheduled
appearance, saying it ``stains the integrity'' of the gaming
industry.

   State police were relieved that
heavy-metal rocker Ozzy Osbourne's latest concert featured less
mayhem than his last appearance at Meadowlands Arena in 1986, when
fans staged a small riot.
   Even so, 19 people were arrested on disorderly conduct charges
and one person was arrested on a drug possession charge at Thursday
night's concert, Lt. Richard Ryan said.
   ``There was much, much less damage than the last time,'' Ryan
said.
   Extra guards patrolled arena aisles and parking areas before,
during and after the performance, arena general manager Michael Rowe
said earlier.
   ``We decided to step up our security for heavy-metal concerts
back in September and this is the first since that decision,'' Rowe
said.
   Osbourne, whose concerts have been marred by rowdiness in the
past, is touring America after a layoff of nearly 1{ years.
   When he appeared at the Meadowlands two years ago, fans broke
arena lights and ripped out about 1,000 seats.

   Cy Young Award winner LaMarr Hoyt wasted
little time getting married after being released from a halfway
house where he finished the remainder of a one-year sentence for
violating parole on a drug conviction.
   The former major league baseball pitcher was released late last
month after five months at the halfway house in his hometown, Alston
Wilkes Society spokeswoman Sharon Driggers said Thursday. The
society runs the halfway house and others in the state.
   ``He completed the program successfully,'' Ms. Driggers said.
   On Saturday, the 33-year-old former Chicago White Sox star
married Leslie Miller of Irmo, a suburb of Columbia. Hoyt has an
apartment in Columbia, but there is no telephone listing for him.
   Hoyt been at the Allenwood Federal Prison Camp in Montgomery,
Pa., before being transferred to the halfway house in his hometown.
   The sentence was imposed after Hoyt, who pleaded guilty in 1986
to two federal misdemeanor drug charges, tested positive for cocaine
in October 1987.
   Hoyt also pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and marijuana
in February after a Dec. 15 drug arrest at his Columbia apartment.
He was sentenced to seven months, to be served concurrently with the
other term.
   Baseball Commissioner Peter Uberroth banned him from baseball for
1987 for his involvement in drug incidents the year before.

<HEAD>Shoddy Construction Blamed For High Death Toll In Armenian Quake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shoddy construction of adobe, brick and
prefabricated concrete buildings caused the high earthquake death
toll in Soviet Armenia, a wood-poor republic located where giant
plates of Earth's crust collide, scientists say.
   ``When they need a new room, they just mix up some mud and start
stacking it,'' Brian Tucker, California's acting state geologist,
said Thursday. ``They are not learning the lesson that buildings
that are just mud fall down.''
   A similar-sized quake in the Los Angeles area, where building
codes are stringent, probably would kill no more than 1,000 people,
said Tucker, who spent two years conducting research east of the
Armenian quake's epicenter.
   ``Earthquakes don't kill people. Buildings do,'' seismologist
Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado at Boulder added during a
news conference at the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   Wednesday's severe quake, centered in the Caucasus Mountains
region near the Soviet-Turkish border, registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale. Reports indicate tens of thousands of people died.
   ``It's a tragedy for all the people of my country,'' said Lev
Zonenshain, a Soviet Institute of Oceanology geologist attending the
geophysics convention.
   Tucker said many Armenian village huts are adobe, while buildings
in cities often are unreinforced masonry or tilt-up, prefabricated
structures made of concrete slabs that are simply hooked together.
   Village homes have ``thick mud and rock ceilings for insulation
in winter,'' and they kill when they collapse, Tucker said.
   While urban Armenian construction practices have improved
somewhat, ``they are still not up to California building codes,'' he
added.
   Zonenshain agreed that many urban Armenian buildings are
unreinforced and said they are built ``from stony blocks of volcanic
material.''
   Armenia lacks enough trees for widespread use of wood buildings,
which better withstand quakes, said U.S. Geological Survey scientist
Bob Hamilton, president of the Geophysical Union's seismology
section.
   ``A 6.9 earthquake that is shallow in the crust in that part of
the world often does a lot of damage because of the nature of the
construction,'' he said.
   Soviet scientists were aware of the threat of major quakes in the
region between the Black and Caspian seas, but many of their studies
suggesting which areas are most vulnerable ``are not made known to
the authorities or judged by any councils'' of scientists, said
George Purcaru of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics in
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Zonenshain denied the allegation, saying, ``We have special
councils organized for (quake) prediction,'' and they have power to
tell authorities to improve construction practices.
   Bilham said the Caucasus Mountains were created by the collision
of the Eurasian Plate of Earth's crust on the north and the Arabian
Plate on the south. The quake occurred along the boundary of the
Eurasian Plate and a ``microplate'' crunched in between the two
giant plates, he said. The boundary also underlies parts of Iran and
Turkey.
   In 1667, a major quake killed an estimated 80,000 people in the
Caucasus Mountains region, Bilham said.
   That jolt's magnitude was between 7 and 7.5, and ``great'' quakes
measuring about 8 on the Richter scale rock the region roughly every
1,000 years, so ``6.9 is not a very big earthquake for that
region,'' Purcaru said.
   Zonenshain said the epicenter of Wednesday's quake was in an area
known as a ``seismic gap,'' which had a lull in major quake activity
for about the last 50 years. Seismic gaps are where the lack of
quakes lets stress build up on faults, making the area more likely
to experience a big quake.
   ``They may have been complacent in the last 50 years because they
didn't have big earthquakes'' in that period, said seismologist
Mansour Niazi, a native Iranian and seismologist at Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory.
   Purcaru said the jolt probably was caused by ``thrust'' or
``dip-slip'' motion, in which compression by the plates makes ground
on one side of a fault move upward over ground on the other side.
   Similar quakes included the 6.4-magnitude San Fernando quake in
Los Angeles in 1971, which state officials say killed at least 58
people, and last year's 5.9-magnitude Whittier Narrows quake, which,
with its aftershocks, killed eight Southern Californians.

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes blasted guerrilla
positions Friday in hills overlooking this coastal town near Beirut
as they tried to rescue trapped paratroopers who landed by
helicopter before dawn, police said.
   They said at least one Israeli soldier was killed and two others
wounded in a clash between the Israeli landing party and guerrillas
of a pro-Syrian Palestinian faction and a leftist Lebanese group.
   ``Other Israeli troops have been captured, but we do not know
their number yet. It seems the Israelis are surrounded,'' said a
police officer in Naameh. He cannot be named under standing rules.
   There was no immediate confirmation from Israel's military
command, which usually issues its communiques only after its
operation has been completed.
   Gunboats cruised off Naameh as five helicopter gunships hovered
overhead, apparently waiting to evacuate the Israeli commandos who
landed on Naameh's bluffs at 2:10 a.m., the spokesman said.
   Eight fighter-bombers thundered in from the clear Mediterranean
sky at dayrteak to blast hilltop targets east of Naameh in 15
bombing sorties, police said.
   ``They are attacking roughly at 15-minute intervals, obviously
trying to help break the noose around their trapped paratroopers in
the Naameh hills,'' the spokesman said.
   The assault began at 6:40 a.m. Black smoke billowed from stricken
targets perched in olive groves above Naameh, police said.
   Naameh is nine miles south of Beirut and 16 miles north of Sidon,
provincial capital of south Lebanon. Ambulances were dispatched from
both cities after the attack.
   The area is controlled by the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command and leftist militiamen of
Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.
   Many cars were seen speeding out with honking horns from the
stricken bluffs to the coastal highway linking Beirut and Sidon.
They were believed rushing casualties to hospitals in both cities.
   Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in Beirut as the
planes staged Israel's 24th air raid on Lebanon this year.
   Fighters of the Popular Front and their Druse allies unleashed a
screen of shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, known as Strellas, against
the raiding jets, but no hits were scored, police said.
   They said Israeli pilots released hot air balloons to deflect the
heat-seeking missiles.
   The Popular Front, headed by former Syrian Army Capt. Ahmed
Jibril, is armed by Syria and funded by Libya. It is at odds with
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine Liberation Organiztion.
   Dozens of guerrillas and militiamen, all toting shoulder-fired
rocket- propelled grenades were seen running to positions along
Naameh's beach as five Israeli helicopter gunships hovered opposite
the coastal town at 8:15 a.m.
   ``They're going to land troops,'' one guerrilla was heard
shouting as he raced to the beachstrip.
   Panicky shopkeepers hurriedly lowered their shutters as hundreds
of Naameh residents scurried to take shelter in basements.
   At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in Israel's 23
previous air raids on Lebanon since Jan. 3.

   The writer traveled to Cuba to cover the visit of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which was canceled.

   At a small park near the seashore, Ofelia Espinosa
says sales at her newsstand of Soviet magazines were negligible two
years ago.
   Now, she says, she prepares for a stampede whenever certain
Soviet publications translated into Spanish arrive, particularly the
monthly ``Sputnik'' and the weekly ``News of Moscow.''
   The difference between now and two years ago is ``glasnost,''
President Mikhail Gorbachev's experiment with allowing open debate
on issues once rarely discussed outside Kremlin walls.
   Glasnost has helped boost sales for Ms. Espinosa. She says she
gets about 60 copies each of the two magazines per delivery.
``They're gone in about five minutes,'' she says, recalling the time
not long ago when the same publications were discarded for lack of
buyers.
   Today was to have been the day Gorbachev began a three-day visit
to Cuba, offering an opportunity to measure his appeal among
ordinary Cubans. But he cut short his three-nation trip Thursday and
rushed back to the Soviet Union from New York to supervise relief
efforts in earthquake-stricken Armenia.
   For Cubans who sense that Marxism is here to stay but who are
eager for a more flexible system, the Soviet leader is the most
promising development in years.
   Several Cubans privately confess their admiration for Gorbachev.
They hope for Soviet-style reforms in Cuba, where outspokenness is
discouraged and the economy has stagnated for years.
   However, millions of other Cubans appear to have retained their
allegiance to Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who has made no secret of
his disdain for Gorbachev's reforms.
   He has left the impression that he is worried the system in place
for 70 years in the Soviet Union could unravel under Gorbachev's
leadership.
   Castro has insisted Cuba will never accept any reform that
``reeks of capitalism.'' His inflexible stand has led to speculation
about a possibly serious Soviet-Cuban rift.
   Despite the tension, Cuban authorities had planned for Gorbachev
the grandest reception ever staged for a visiting luminary, with a
projected 500,000 lining the parade route.
   U.S. and Cuban analysts agree that the foundation of Soviet-Cuban
friendship remains solid. Castro helps the Soviets collect political
support worldwide, and the Soviets lavish an estimated $5 billion in
annual economic aid on Cuba.
   Some Westerners, however, believe the Soviet Union has been
dissatisfied with Cuban economic performance for years. It is not
known if Gorbachev has pressured Cuba to impose capitalist-style
reforms to revive the Cuban economy.
   With the postponement of Gorbachev's visit, the answer probably
will not be forthcoming for now.

<HEAD>New Peacekeeping Mission Could Break United Nations, Says U.N.
Chief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demands for new peacekeeping missions could
force the financially strapped United Nations into insolvency in
1989, according to a report by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar.
   The U.N. chief's pessimistic assessment was released Thursday
before he left for Oslo, Norway, to accept the 1988 Nobel Peace
Prize on behalf of U.N. peacekeepers worldwide.
   The Nobel includes a cash prize worth about $390,000, but that
won't make much of a dent in the $450.1 million in unpaid dues that
U.N. members owe. The United States owes $337.3 million.
   U.N. officials haven't announced how the award money being
collected Saturday will be used.
   On Wednesday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev spoke to the
General Assembly and called for a new U.N. peacekeeping force in
Afghanistan to oversee establishment of a broad-based government.
   U.N. officials already are drafting plans for a 7,500-member
peacekeeping force to monitor South-West Africa's transition to
independence. Plans also are under way to send 2,000 peacekeeping
troops to monitor an independence referendum in Western Sahara.
   Perez de Cuellar predicted that in 1989, the United Nations will
collect $779.3 million but will spend $803.9 million, ending the
year with a loss of $24.6 million.
   He based his projections on current payment patterns.
   ``The United Nations has yet to leave behind the spectre of the
financial crisis. Throughout 1988, the organization has confronted
the possibility of imminent bankruptcy, which it has narrowly
managed to avoid so far,'' Perez de Cuellar wrote in the report.
   Only 79 of the 159 member states had paid all their dues as of
Nov. 30, he said. ``Of the 80 member states still in arrears, 40
owed more than their 1988 assessments,'' he added.
   Assuming next year's payment patterns are like 1988, the U.N.
chief said ``the organization would manage to avoid insolvency, but
only by once again utilizing its reserves to meet cash requirements
at many points during the year.''
   The United Nations has a contingency reserve fund of about $210
million that must be replenished as soon as new dues are paid. The
United Nations often dips into this fund to start new peacekeeping
operations or to meet operating costs.
   ``The financial situation of the United Nations could rapidly and
dramatically deteriorate should any additional demands be placed
upon these depleted reserves to meet the cash requirements for
existing or new peacekeeping operations,'' the report says.
   President Reagan said in September that the United States would
gradually repay all its dues. It has withheld money in recent years
to protest what the Reagan administration saw as mismanagement,
overstaffing, and an anti-Western bias at the United Nations.

   The earthquake that devastated several cities and
wiped out villages in Soviet Armenia may have also doomed priceless
medieval art and early Christian churches in the region, an art

   ``That area is full of medieval monuments and churches,'' said
Lucy Der Manuelian, professor of Armenian art and architecture at
Tufts University. ``Some are over a thousand years old.''
   Wednesday's earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Leninakan, a city
of 250,000 people 30 miles from the epicenter, and wiped out the
nearby village of Spitak, a Soviet TV correspondent said. Early
estimates put the death toll at 50,000 to 70,000.
   Atop a mountain less than a mile from Leninakan is a 7th century
church called St. Stepanos, which contains rare wall paintings. A
domed church made of rose and brown-colored volcanic stone, St.
Stepanos is a ``priceless treasure,'' Manuelian said.
   She fears it may have been destroyed becaues it is so close to
the quake's center, but she said she has not been able to find out.
   Also within a few miles of Leninakan is an 11th century Marmashen
church and a 13th century monastery called Harich, which has a
museum that may contain priceless medieval gospel manuscripts,
Manuelian said.
   Across the border from Armenia in Eastern Turkey are the ruins of
the 9th century capital city of Armenia, called Ani. Scholars
believe that city's 10th century cathedral may have been the
inspiration for Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Western
Europe, she said.
   Armenia was the first country to make Christianity its official
religion in the year 314, Manuelian said. Its early stone churches
are of special interest because some scholars believe that Europeans
learned the building techniques used on their towering cathedrals
from the Armenians.
   ``The Soviets have been spending million of rubles to restore
these Armenian churches,'' Manuelian said. ``Whatever is destroyed
of medieval Armenian architecture is a terrific loss, because the
ones in Turkey aren't being taken care of.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Stocks Up Moderately</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese yen today
in Tokyo, while stock prices rose moderately as participants weighed
the impact of the resignation of Japan's finance minister.
   The dollar ended the week at 122.43 yen, down 0.59 yen from
Thursday's closing of 123.02 yen. After opening sharply lower at
122.20 yen, the U.S. currency edged up, ranging between 122.10 and
122.47 yen during the day.
   The dollar's decline in Tokyo followed a drop in New York, where
it closed Thursday at 122.28 yen.
   In Tokyo, many participants began selling the dollar after
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced his resignation, said
Mitsuhiko Kinugasa of Daiwa Bank.
   Many traders feared the departure of Miyazawa, who had opposed a
weaker dollar, could damage current international monetary
coordination, he said.
   Miyazawa announced his resignation near midday, saying he wished
to clear the way for the passage of tax reform bills now being
discussed in the upper house of parliament.
   Opposition parties had opposed a continuation of debate on the
bills until Miyazawa resigned because of inconsistencies in his
accounts of his involvement in a stock trading scandal.
   Dozens of politicians and other influential people have been
linked to the scandal, involving the purchase of unlisted shares in
Recruit-Cosmos, a real-estate company, at bargain prices, and their
subsequent resale when the stock began being traded publicly.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita accepted Miyazawa's resignation
and appointed himself finance minister. He told reporters today that
Miyazawa's departure from the Cabinet would not have a strong impact
on exchange markets.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,
which plunged 291.92 points Thursday, regained 34.52 points or 0.11
percent, closing the week at 29,793.42.
   Many traders stayed on the sidelines because of caution over the
possible impact of Miyazawa's resignation on the currency and stock
markets, dealers said.
   Toshiaki Yui of Nomura Securities said the Nikkei rose in spite
of the wait-and-see mood because of lingering bullishness from the
Nikkei index having achieved the 30,000-point level for the first
time on Wednesday and the rise of the dollar after the Soviet
Union's announcement of an arms reduction.
   ``Minor stocks have been attracting participants recently, which
is likely to help the market accumulate strength,'' he said.
   Yui said the Nikkei index has been strong because the Japanese
economy is expanding, whereas the United States continues to run
large trade and budget deficits.
   Volume traded on the market's first section was estimated at 1
billion shares.

<TEXT>
   A year after the Palestinian
uprising began, Israeli soldiers believe they are gradually
regaining control of the streets despite ongoing clashes.
   Talks with soldiers in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank
indicate morale is much improved since the chaotic early days of the
uprising, when thousands of Palestinians joined demonstrations
against Israel's 21-year occupation.
   Today, the best evidence things have changed is that
confrontations are usually limited to skirmishes with small groups
of Arab youths who appear only long enough to hurl a stone before
vanishing into the narrow alleyways.
   ``In the beginning we used to face crowds of 5,000 people. Now we
are dealing with at most about 100,'' said Lt. Col. Micha, whose
infantry unit recently returned to this squalid refugee camp of
70,000.
   Micha recalls that in December 1987 his unit was transferred from
Lebanon and thrust into the riots without training or the necessary
tools.
   ``We got here and we suddenly had no weapons to use, no
artillery, no tanks,'' said Micha, whose full name was not disclosed
in keeping with army policy.
   ``We had clubs, and they had sticks, and we battled like gangs.
Officers were simply told to make the situation quiet, and there was
a lot of gray in the orders so every soldier had his own method for
dealing with the population.''
   At least 320 Palestinians have been killed in the rebellion since
it began Dec. 8, 1987, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Eleven
Israelis also have been slain and 7,000 Palestinians wounded during
the same period.
   In recent interviews, army commanders attributed the drop in
large protests to improved crowd control devices such as plastic
bullets, which are less lethal than live ammunition and allow
soldiers to use rifles more freely.
   The army also has developed fender-mounted tear-gas launchers,
rooftop guns that fire rubber bullets, hot marbles or gravel, and a
wagon equipped with a scoop to remove roadblocks.
   ``Soldiers feel they have an answer. There is no longer such
frustration and feelings of impotence. The soldiers feel they
control the situation,'' said Col. Segev, who commands troops in
Nablus, the West Bank's largest town.
   Taunted by demonstrators who hurled provocative insults as well
as stones and bottles, soldiers sometimes lost control, beating
detainees or smashing houses and cars.
   In one case last spring in Kfar Salem village, soldiers used a
bulldozer to bury alive four Palestinians. The four were rescued by
witnesses minutes later.
   The army said 45 soldiers have been court-martialed since last
December for using excessive force. More soldiers have been
disciplined through less formal trials. The army will not say how
many.
   Brig. Gen. Ehud Gross, the chief army education officer,
described the number of violations as ``minor'' when compared to the
thousands of soldiers who have been sent to the occupied areas.
   Israeli newspapers say the army has an average of 10,000 troops
deployed each day in the occupied territories _ several times the
pre-uprising level.
   In an interview, Gross emphasized repeatedly that the army
believed excessive force would have a boomerang effect.
   ``If we want to bring some tranquility, some peace to the area,
the less we create polarization and hatred by revenge the more
chances there are for better future understanding,'' he said.
   The new emphasis on restraint is contained in a two-day course
instituted recently to prepare soldiers for duty in the occupied
areas and in a new briefing kit prepared for commanders.
   Gross said the army's mission was to restore enough order to
``enable the government to make its decisions free from pressure, or
under the least amount of pressure possible.''
   He claimed the army ``can cope with the mission, and we can
fulfill it.''

<HEAD>Former NY Fed Member Indicted For Insider Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former director of the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York has been indicted on insider trading charges for a
scheme to leak secret interest rate figures to a now-bankrupt
brokerage firm.
   A federal indictment returned Thursday charged former New Jersey
Bankers Association president Robert A. Rough with conspiracy to
commit fraud in the first insider trading case involving government
securities, prosecutors said.
   It was also the first time in the 75-year history of the Federal
Reserve that a director has been charged with fraud, said Samuel A.
Alito Jr., the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey.
   ``We believe this is an isolated case,'' Alito said. ``But we
will prosecute it vigorously to try to insure it isn't repeated in
the future.''
   Rough, 49, received $47,000 in interest-deferred loans from the
now-defunct Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc. investment firm in
exchange for the rate information, the indictment charged. He was a
member of the Federal Reserve Bank, part of the Fed's regional
network, from 1982 to 1984.
   Rough was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities
fraud, two counts of bank fraud, one count each of wire fraud and
securities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks.
   He faces 29 years in prison if convicted on all counts and fines
totaling $141,000, Alito said.
   Rough is accused of relaying the information by telephone from
his executive suite at the National Bank of Sussex County, where he
served as president, and once from the New York Fed's boardroom just
after a meeting, prosecutors said at a news conference.
   Bevill, Bresler made millions of dollars in government securities
trades based on Rough's advance word about decisions made by the
Federal Reserve and recommendations offered by the New York Fed on
the discount rate, the indictment said.
   The discount rate is the interest rate the Federal Reserve
charges on loans to commercial banks. Changes in the discount rate
can have a strong impact on world financial markets and affect
interest rates paid by consumers.
   Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, said Rough would enter a plea
of not guilty and ``vigorously contest the charges.''
   Rough's home telephone number was unlisted and he could not be
reached for comment. He resigned earlier this year as president of
the National Bank.
   The New York Fed is one of 12 regional banks in the Federal
Reserve System, all of which make recommendations every two weeks on
whether the discount rate should be changed. The national Federal
Reserve Board has the final say in setting the rate.
   Word that discount rate information had been leaked first
surfaced in April 1987, prompting the Fed to tighten its rules on
disclosing the rate.
   The allegations came to light during the trial of Gilbert C.
Schulman, Bevill, Bresler's president, on fraud charges after the
firm's $144 million collapse in April 1985. Three other principals
who pleaded guilty in the firm's collapse in exchange for their
cooperation testified about Rough's allegedly passing on the
information.
   Schulman, a long-time friend of Rough's, is serving an eight-year
sentence for securities violations.
   Schulman testified that Rough approached him for the $47,000 in
loans, which were repaid, to buy a chunk of stock in the National
Bank of Sussex.
   No arraignment date has been set.

<HEAD>500 U.S. Infants Die Each Year from Diarrhea _ But Don't Need to</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say simple health care measures could
save most of the 500 U.S. children who die each year of diarrhea, a
problem rarely considered life-threatening in this country.
   New research suggests that diarrhea accounts for 10 percent of
all preventable deaths in U.S. youngsters ages 1 month to 4 years
old, said Dr. Mei-Shang Ho of the national Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   ``The key here is early treatment,'' Ms. Ho said in a telephone
interview Thursday.
   Diarrhea is a common cause of childhood deaths in developing
countries, but such deaths generally are thought to be rare in more
economically advanced nations.
   However, Ms. Ho and her colleagues identified 5,539 diarrhea
deaths among youngsters ages 1 month to 4 years nationwide during
the years 1973 through 1983.
   Deaths were most common among children younger than 1 year,
blacks and youngsters living in the South, the researchers reported
in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Thirty-eight percent of the deaths occurred after the child had
reached a medical facility _ suggesting either the youngsters got
help too late or got the wrong treatment, Ms. Ho said.
   She estimated that 80 percent to 90 percent of the diarrhea
deaths in the United States could be prevented.
   Diarrhea can be fatal if it causes severe loss of fluids and
electrolytes _ body salts such as sodium and potassium _ that are
necessary for normal functioning of nerves and muscles, including
the heart, Ms. Ho explained.
   Lost fluids need to be replaced with electrolyte solutions
containing glucose, a form of sugar, she said. The solutions can be
bought ready-to-drink at grocery and drug stores without
prescriptions, she said.
   Infants who can't keep the fluids down or who lose more than they
keep should be taken to a doctor, Ms. Ho said.
   Parents need to be taught the dangers of severe diarrhea, she
said, as well as ways to give appropriate fluids when the need
arises and when to see a doctor if that strategy fails.
   ``It shouldn't be hard to acquire those skills, if it is pushed
by health caretakers. It's not pushed enough in this country,'' she
said.
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. John Snyder of
Children's Hosptial in Boston called the overall findings
``troubling,'' especially since black victims outnumbered whites
four to one.
   He agreed that educational efforts would be ``the most direct and
immediate answer to this grave problem.''
   Many different organisms can cause diarrhea, including bacteria
and parasites, but a type of virus called rotavirus causes one-third
of all childhood diarrhea cases requiring hospitalization, the
researchers said.
   Bacteria and parasites can be avoided with careful hand-washing
and food preparation, but rotaviruses are virtually inescapable and
almost everyone gets infected by them at some point during
childhood, Ms. Ho said.

<HEAD>Air Force: No Grounding for A-10s Despite Two Crashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRACY, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has no plans to ground the A-10
attack plane despite two crashes in Arizona and West Germany that
occurred within hours of each other, leaving six people dead and 51
injured.
   ``I can tell you from this standpoint, we're not tying the two of
them together,'' Davis-Monthan Air Force Base spokeswoman Carol Ann
Keck said here following Thursday's crashes.
   An A-10 Thunderbolt II assigned to a Royal Air Force base in
England smashed into an apartment house in Remscheid, West Germany,
at 1:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. EST), killing six people and
injuring 51, authorities said.
   Ten hours later, an A-10 based at Davis-Monthan crashed on the
Tohono O'Odham Reservation near Tracy about 80 miles west of Tucson,
officials said. The pilot, who ejected, was in good condition at the
base hospital.
   Both jets were on training missions.
   The Tactical Air Command said in a statement late Thursday that
it would not ground the A-10,which statistically is the safest
fighter or attack plane currently in the Air Force inventory.
   The Air Force, however, suspended all tactical training flights
in Europe until Tuesday.
   Witnesses to the Remscheid crash said the twin-engine jet hit the
top floor of an apartment building. A Davis-Monthan spokesman said
there was no immediate word on what caused that accident.
   ``We can't speculate on what caused the accident,'' said Capt.
Mark Besich. ``We have a board of officers formed to investigate,
and they'll determine that.'' The board left for the crash site.
   Besich said the pilot of the single-seat airplane, Capt. Michael
Nutterfield, 29, of Hutchinson, Kan., gave no indication of what the
problem had been.
   A helicopter picked Nutterfield up at 6 p.m., and flew him to the
hospital, said Besich, who had no specifics on the pilot's injuries.
   Like many West Germans, Indians on the reservation have
complained for years about low-level military flights. Objections
center on the noise and the possibility of crashes, said Andrew
Patricio, vice chairman of the Tohono O'Odham Legislative Council.
   ``One of these days it (the aircraft) might fall in one of these
communities, on top of a house,'' he said.
   ``You can see them flying practically at window-level,'' said
Patricio. ``That's been an issue for the last 10 years. I don't
think there's ever going to be an agreement.''
   The A-10 is designed to support soldiers on the ground by
attacking enemy tanks and other high-priority targets. The
Thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with the Air
Force in 1977. The plane is no longer in production, but the Air
Force has more than 700 of them in its inventory.
   The aircraft has chalked up a major accident rate of less than
four Class A mishaps per 100,000 flying hours over its lifetime _
which now consists of more than 1.75 million flight hours. A Class A
mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or damage
exceeding $500,000 to an aircraft.
   In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the Air Force lost three A-10s.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Resigns In Wake Of Widening Stock Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigned today,
becoming the first Cabinet-level casualty in a widening scandal over
conflicting statements about his involvement in questionable stock
purchases.
   ``I have many regrets, but we are not getting anywhere without
clearing this deadlock,'' Miyazawa told a news conference after
submitting his resignation to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   Miyazawa, who is also giving up his position as deputy prime
minister, said he is stepping down to help pave the way for passage
of sweeping tax reform bills.
   ``I feel that accomplishing tax reform is my mission and I did
not want to stand in the way of completion of the tax reform
bills,'' Miyazawa said. ``Personally, I hope the tax reform bills
will be passed soon and it doesn't matter what happens to me.''
   Takeshita said he would assume Miyazawa's post as finance
minister. The prime minister is expected to shuffle his Cabinet in a
few weeks, but Takeshita declined to say how long he would hold the
finance portfolio.
   Opposition parties in Parliament have been stalling debate on the
tax reform, demanding first that Miyazawa resign.
   Miyazawa has been under fire for giving conflicting accounts
about his alleged involvement in the scandal. One of Miyazawa's
former aides bought shares of Recruit-Cosmos Co. before they were
registered to trade over the counter, and sold them immediately for
a 20 million yen ($163,000) profit.
   Miyazawa is the most important figure to fall so far in the
five-month scandal, which has shaken public confidence and
implicated a range of influential figures in business and government.
   Public support for Takeshita's government has dropped to 18
percent from 30 percent when he assumed office a year ago, according
to a survey released today by the mass-circulation newspaper
Mainichi Shimbun.
   But political analysts said the resignation has been anticipated
for some time and would have minimal economic and political impact.
   ``We knew he had to go sooner or later,'' said Masumi Ishikawa, a
commentator for the national daily Asahi Shimbun. ``He must have
judged politically that now is the right timing to quit to give the
impression that he is sacrificing himself for the sake of tax bills,
rather than taking blame for the scandal.''
   Opposition parties responded to the resignation with mixed
signals.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the largest opposition
group, the Japan Socialist Party, said the resignation was well
overdue, but that his party did not intend to participate in
parliamentary debate on the tax reform package.
   ``Since the finance minister, who is in charge of carrying out
the tax reform, resigned, the tax reform bills start again from
scratch,'' he said.
   Komeito, or the Clean Government Party, however, said in a
statment that Miyazawa's resignation had cleared the way for
full-fledged deliberations on the tax legislation.
   The legislation, Japan's first sweeping overhaul of its tax
system since the end of the World War II, has been a top priority
for the Liberal Democratic Party for a decade.
   Successive administrations have failed to pass the reform due to
a lack of public support and strong resistance from opposition
parties. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, under whom
Miyazawa also served as finance minister, staked his political
career on tax reform and lost.
   The new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax
scales and introduces a 3-percent sales tax.

<TEXT>
   The abrupt departure of Mikhail Gorbachev
elicited sympathy and sadness from those who were dropped from his
itinerary, but others fed up with two days of ``Gorby-lock'' had few
regrets.
   ``The mood is very sad,'' said Elaine Fink, principal of P.S. 6,
the Manhattan grammar school that had hoped to host the Soviet
leader's wife, Raisa, Thursday afternoon. ``It's a lesson in
disappointment for us all.''
   The lesson was echoed at each planned stop by the Gorbachevs on
their final day in Manhattan. The Soviet leader returned home a day
early to lead relief efforts for victims of a massive earthquake
that ravaged Armenia.
   ``I think the only thing we can say is to express sympathy for
the earthquake victims,'' said John Ross, head of public relations
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, another Big Apple tourist sight
missed by Gorbachev.
   The Soviet President's admiring American hosts managed to squeeze
in one last event just before he boarded his plane at Kennedy
International Airport just after noon Thursday. Former astronaut
James B. Irwin presented Gorbachev with a Soviet flag that went to
the moon in 1971 with the Apollo 15 mission.
   Irwin said he and his crewmates, David R. Scott and Alfred
Worden, signed the flag, which was one of a number of foreign flags
carried by the moonwalkers.
   Gorbachev and his wife also had planned a short stroll through
Central Park before their museum visit and a morning stop at the
Javits Convention Center for a Soviet trade show.
   ``I guess I'll just go do some Christmas shopping and go home,''
said John Chrystal, chief operating officer of Bankers Trust Co. of
Des Moines, Iowa, who was invited by Gorbachev to attend the trade
event.
   Chrystal's uncle, Roswell Garst, owned the Iowa farm that Nikita
Khrushchev visited in one of the high points of his 1959 American
tour.
   ``Yes, we are disappointed, but who can argue with an
earthquake?'' asked Parks Commissioner Henry Stern, who was to be
Gorbachev's host in the park. ``We hope he can come back another
time.''
   For the New York City Police Department, sympathy and sorrow gave
way to relief over savings. Officials figured the visit cost
$613,000 in overtime; the extra day would have put that figure at $1
million.
   The sighs of relief also came from the Transportation Department,
which battled mild ``Gorby-lock'' caused by Gorbachev's motorcade
and stifled traffic in midtown Manhattan Wednesday.
   ``We're doing better now,'' said Joe O'Brien, a spokesman for the
department.
   Also bumped by the change in plans was billionaire developer
Donald Trump, whose invitation to have Gorbachev visit the opulent
Trump Tower was rejected. Trump was among a group scheduled for
dinner Thursday night at the Soviet Mission; instead, the closest he
came to the Soviet leader was a glimpse of a Gorby look-alike on
Tuesday.

   The immigration chief today said she
will chop airport officials ``into 1,000 pieces'' and feed them to
the sharks if they don't stop smuggling entertainers out of the
country.
   Miriam Defensor Santiago, head of the Commission on Immigration
and Deportation, said some officials of her agency have made
fortunes providing fake permits allowing Filipinos to work abroad as
entertainers.
   Officials say many of those who leave the country illegally are
recruited by criminal organizations in Japan and elsewhere and end
up working as prostitutes.
   ``I'm going to chop you into 1,000 pieces,'' Mrs. Santiago said
during a television interview. ``I'll throw you and feed you to the
sharks in Manila Bay. However, I doubt if the sharks would eat you
out of a sense of professional courtesy.''
   Mrs. Santiago claimed immigration officials at Manila's Ninoy
Aquino International Airport had been faking arrest reports to fool
her into believing they were cracking down on illegal activities.
   ``These CID employees thought they could get away with it,'' she
said, shaking her finger at the camera. ``I know for a fact that
these employees have been presenting alleged arrests to me in a
misguided attempt to lull me into a false sense of ignorance about
what is going on at the airport.''
   Mrs. Santiago, a former judge, said her employees ``have been
making fortunes from these illegal rackets at the airport right
under my nose.''
   In September, retired Maj. Gen. Cesar Tapia resigned as director
of security at the airport because he said he was powerless to stamp
out corruption there among immigration and customs agents.
   In November, Evergisto Macatulad resigned as airport general
manager, the third airport chief to quit since President Corazon
Aquino took office in February 1986.
   The country's law enforcement chief, meanwhile, has ordered an
investigation into allegations that police and soldiers are involved
in car theft rings.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, commander of the Philippine
Constabulary, issued the order Thursday after the highway patrol
reported at least five military officers belonged to a car theft
ring known as the ``Silver Edition.''
   A highway patrol report said the five were identified by gang
members arrested in a series of raids in the Manila area.
   Allegations that police and soldiers were involved in criminal
gangs have been widespread in the Philippines for years.
   On Sunday, Montano ordered the dismantling of permanent military
checkpoints at the edge of Manila and warned soldiers against
shaking down travelers for money and goods.
   The checkpoints were established to prevent communist rebels and
right-wing extremists from entering Manila.
   But travelers and bus companies have complained that armed
troopers extort money and supplies from passengers and operators.

   With Pravda headlining ``Our pain and tragedy'' on
its front page and television showing soldiers digging for
schoolchildren in piles of rubble, Soviet media have covered the
devastating earthquake in Armenia with unprecedented detail and
urgency.
   ``Helpless, sobbing people are climbing on the wreckage of an
apartment house, from which can be heard heart-rending cries for
help,'' Pravda reported today in a dramatic departure from its
typical dry reports of Communist Party decrees and speeches.
   ``Powerless, without anything they can do, the living
superstitiously run back and forth,'' the story said.
   Driven by destruction that has killed tens of thousands of
people, Soviet authorities are using the media to broadcast urgent
appeals for everything from heavy-duty cranes to blood.
   Officials also are emphasizing the need for national cooperation
in coping with the tragedy, in an attempt to use the disaster to
stop the ethnic strife that has killed at least 60 people in Armenia
and neighboring Azerbaijan this year and sent 180,000 fleeing their
homes in fear of mobs.
   Parts of both republics were being patrolled by soldiers and
tanks when the quake hit.
   ``Reproaches and mutual offenses are thrown away'' in the
aftermath of such a tragedy, Azerbaijani health minister T.A.
Kasumov said on national television Thursday. ``There is a saying
among the Azerbaijani people: `The pain unites,''' he said.
   ``Our hospitals are ready to take patients and wounded from
Armenia, and they will be surrounded by special care and
attention,'' Kasumov promised. That would be a stark contrast to
recent weeks, when medical care and food supplies had been denied to
whole neighborhoods of Armenians in Azerbaijan.
   The focus of much of the Soviet reporting has been on the
rescuers rather than victims.
   Television journalists spoke sadly of tens of thousands of dead
Thursday, but their film showed crunched and crushed buildings
rather than children's mangled bodies. Reporters interviewed
officials about the rescue effort instead of grieving parents.
   Broadcasters spoke of half the city of Kirovakan being leveled,
but they showed no aerial photos indicating the extent of the
damage. Nor were there pictures of tent cities being erected to
shelter families left homeless by the quake.
   Most Soviet photographers aimed their cameras at the relief
effort: evacuation of victims by military helicopters, cranes
clearing away destruction and volunteers rushing to donate blood.
   A few of the photographs published in Moscow and sent abroad by
the official news agency Tass show grieving women in Spitak, and
mothers and their bundled children huddling around campfires in the
remnants of downtown Leninakan.
   Tass photographer Sergei Chistyakov said his agency sold one such
dramatic photo to the French photo agency SIPA for $2,500 for its
exclusive use outside the Soviet Union. ``I hate to sell pictures of
the tragedy,'' he said. ``But we are on `self-accounting' now, and
they say we must.''
   Soviet enterprises are switching to a new economic regime where
they must turn a profit.
   Today's reports in the national newspapers were the first to
detail the suffering of the victims. The story was given remarkable
prominence.
   Pravda ran a photo of a partially collapsed building on its front
page, a spot normally reserved for pictures of happy workers and
politicians.
   The relative speed of the coverage is also remarkable in a nation
that until recently ignored natural disasters.
   Just last week, it left unreported the hijacking of a bus full of
30 schoolchildren until foreign news agencies learned of it through
air traffic control communications on the hijackers' plans to fly to
Israel.
   The earthquake was first reported in one of the most unlikely
sources of news on the Soviet Union, the Islamic Republic News
Agency of Iran.
   But shortly thereafter, Soviet seismologists confirmed it to
questioning reporters. Still, it was not until eight hours after the
quake hit that Tass called it a disaster.
   And it was not until Thursday, when President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev cut short his trip to New York to oversee relief efforts,
that officials began to speak of thousands of dead.
   Part of the delay can be explained by the destruction itself.
   Chistyakov said Tass photographers based in Yerevan reached the
damaged area via military helicopter while the Tass correspondents
were stuck on the blocked highway. As a result, he said, Tass had
pictures ready to transmit before it had a story.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Meets With Czech Dissidents At Embassy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   French President Francois
Mitterrand met today with eight leading Czechoslovak dissidents, the
first such meeting by a Western leader on an official visit to
Prague.
   Leading human rights activists had voiced fears before
Mitterrand's two-day visit started Thursday that it would be
exploited by the Communist authorities to mute recent Western
criticism of the jailing and repression of independent activists.
   But banned playwright Vaclav Havel, who wrote an open letter to
Mitterrand last week regarding those fears, said after the 75-minute
breakfast at the French embassy that the president was ``very
well-informed about the situation'' in Czechoslovakia.
   ``I am very satisfied with this conversation,'' Havel said. ``It
is the first time a head of a state officially met independent
activists. It is a new phenomenon which is very important for us.''
   Havel, a leading signatory of the Charter 77 human rights
document, also expressed satisfaction that Mitterrand lauded the
1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms in a dinner speech Wednesday.
   The speech was printed in full this morning in the Communist
Party daily Rude Pravo.
   ``It's the first positive mention of the Prague Spring in Rude
Pravo in 20 years,'' Havel said, smiling.
   Charter 77 spokesman Milos Hajek, another dissident present at
the meeting, called Mitterrand's mention of the Prague Spring
``excellent.''
   Others attending the meeting at the French embassy were Charter
77 signatories Jiri Dienstbier, Petr Uhl, Ladislav Lis, Rudolf
Battek and Vaclav Maly, a banned Roman Catholic priest.
   Karel Srp, leader of the independent cultural group the Jazz
Section, was the eighth man present.
   The meeting took place a day before Communist authorities permit
a demonstration called by Charter 77 and four other independent
groups to mark the 40th anniversary of International Human Rights
Day.
   For the first time since 1969, authorities have given permission
for the independent gathering.
   Havel said he was sure this was connected with Mitterrand's visit.
   ``The day after he leaves, they could not do what they did with
other independent demonstrations,'' Havel said.
   In October, hundreds of police with water cannon, tear gas,
batons and dogs broke up a crowd of about 5,000 who defied a ban on
a rally called by the same five groups to mark 70 years of
Czechoslovak independence.
   Another demonstration protesting the 1968 invasion that crushed
reform in Czechoslovakia was also broken up by police in August.

   The British-Chinese negotiators working out
details of turning Hong Kong over to Chinese rule ended their 11th
meeting today with an agreement over the territory's future
extradition arrangements.
   The British colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under
an agreement reached four years ago by London and Beijing. The
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group was formed to help implement the
accord.
   A statement from the group said the two sides ``reached agreement
on the basic principles'' by which Hong Kong will make its own
arrangements for extradition after 1997, but provided no details.
The territory now relies on Britain's network of extradition
treaties.
   ``As a major financial and commercial center, Hong Kong should be
able to maintain its own network of extradition agreements,'' said
Robin McLaren, spokesman for the British team. ``Nobody wants Hong
Kong to become a sort of haven for criminals which people could go
to and couldn't be extradited from.''
   The group also discussed the withdrawal of British armed forces
from the colony and arrangements for Chinese troops to be based
here, but again no details were provided.
   The liaison group will meet next March in Beijing.

   How do you make a nude statue respectable?
Stand it against a wall, according to the Loveland Visual Arts
Commission.
   The commission was caught in a controversy that broke out over
``Moulding Our Future,'' a proposed 7-foot-tall bronze monument
meant to celebrate love, the town's namesake.
   On Thursday, the commission wriggled out of the problem,
tentatively approving the statue of a mother with a child at her
breast for a new park, but ordering the sculpture to be turned
toward a wig shop wall so it won't offend passers-by.
   The woman's breasts will also be covered by trees, hiding them
from unsuspecting strollers.
   About 600 residents signed a petition against the statue, saying
they like love and Loveland but wanted the statue to have another
home. Customers at the wig shop also protested.
   The commission is scheduled to take a final vote on the statue
Dec. 16.
   Artist Denny Hasken was happy with the compromise because the
child in his work will be facing park visitors.
   ``This is not a nude,'' Hasken said. ``This is a mother and
child.''

   Hansels and Gretels beware: Peter
Brochu's gingerbread house may be the world's largest.
   Brochu, executive chef at the Callaway Gardens Inn, had the help
of seven chefs, 13 cooks and the entire maintenance department of
the west Georgia resort to build the gingerbread house _ complete
with lights, chimney, picket fence lined with poinsettias and
icicles hanging from the roof.
   There are 450 pounds of candies and cookies in the decorations.
   Modeled after the structure that almost led to the downfall of
Hansel and Gretel in the fairy tale, the house on display in the
lobby of Callaway Gardens through New Year's Day.
   The structure, 14 feet long, 6{ feet high and 4 feet wide, is
built from, among other things, 1,200 pounds of powdered sugar, 175
sheet pans of gingerbread, 1,080 egg whites, 120 pounds of honey,
550 pounds of all-purpose flour and 1,200 assorted Christmas lights.
   ``It might be a record, we don't know,'' Brochu said. ``But it's
just beautiful, especially at night with all the lights.''
   Working night and day for three days over Thanksgiving weekend,
it took Brochu and his crew 315 hours to complete the confectionary
castle.

   The dollar fell today against most major currencies
in modest late-morning European trading but traders said they
expected little movement during the session.
   Gold prices fell.
   Traders said the exchange market was coming off a dollar rally
that followed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's announcement
earlier in the week of troop reductions.
   In Germany, they said official dollar sales by the Deutsche
Bundesbank Thursday added to the currency's weakness.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to move in a reasonably
narrow range through today's session.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.59 yen to a closing 122.43 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 122.65 yen.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.8435 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8510 Thursday.
   Other mid-morning dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday:
   _1.7375 West German marks, down from 1.7420
   _1.4625 Swiss francs, down from 1.4665
   _5.9375 French francs, down from 5.9450

   Gold opened at a bid price of $422.10 a troy ounce, down from
$423.50 late Thursday. At mid-morning, London's major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $422.20.
   In Zurich, gold fell to close at a bid $422.65 from $423 bid late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.24 to close at a bid $423.64.

<TEXT>
   City and state officials are engaged in a rat race
for the control of a potentially pesky problem of rampant rodents.
   The city is starting a decade-long excavation and reconstruction
project that some experts say could have rats overrunning the city.
   At odds are the director of rodent control for Boston and an
rat-control expert hired by the state, a professor from Bowling
Green State University in Ohio.
   The officials are arguing over a report released recently by the
state that city officials claim excludes them from rat control plans
and does not focus enough on early prevention.
   ``We question what will happen if our plans don't jibe,'' said
Sam Wood, director of the city Inspectional Services Department.
``The way the report is written, it's like people will call us with
complaints and we'll have to decide if it's a complaint about a city
rat or a state rat.''
   William Jackson, on the faculty at Bowling Green, was hired by
the state to develop a plan to curb the spread of rats when
excavation begins downtown in 1990. The $4.5 billion project
includes a plan to build a third tunnel under Boston Harbor and
transform the Central Artery from a six-lane elevated highway to an
eight- to 10-lane underground expressway.
   Jackson and his firm, Biocenotics, issued a report on a plan to
eradicate the thousands of rats expected to be uprooted from their
homes during construction.
   Jackson's plan calls for placing rat bait around three ``rodent
control zones'' along the construction route. According to the plan,
the baiting would begin 60 and 90 days before construction.
   The plan also calls for an education program to inform residents
on rodent-proofing and sanitation, negotiations with utility
agencies and public agencies about rat control.
   Wood charged that Jackson's team ignored the city's seven-point
plan issued last summer that outlined the need for early prevention,
constant monitoring by city inspectors and an emergency team to
respond to resident complaints.
   Wood claims that Jackson's plans concentrate on underground
rodent control efforts but do not allow the city enough staff to
respond to problems that arise when rats escape after construction.
   Jackson was en route from Bowling Green to Boston on Thursday and
was not available for comment.
   Central Artery project director William V. Twomey said Thursday
that Jackson and his firm were hired because state officials
believed a rat control expert was needed to develop an ``overall
perspective'' of the rodent problem.
   ``I'm surprised at Mr. Wood's comments,'' he said. ``The report
is peppered with references to working with city officials. We want
to work with them and take their plans into consideration.''

<HEAD>Researchers Retreat From Evidence For Two New Forces Of Nature</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are retreating from studies
indicating more than four basic forces of nature run the universe,
citing a major flaw in experiments that suggested gravity is
slightly countered by a fifth force and enhanced by a sixth.
   ``As yet there's no convincing evidence,'' said Robert Parker of
the La Jolla-based Scripps Institution of Oceanography, a
participant in a research group that now questions its own findings.
   Richard Hughes, a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in
New Mexico, put the case more strongly:
   ``There are only four forces in nature. Read my lips. No new
forces,'' he said.
   The scientists from Scripps, Los Alamos, AT&T Bell Laboratories
in New Jersey and other institutions backtracked on statements they
made last July when they reported strong evidence suggesting Sir
Isaac Newton's 301-year-old law of gravity was wrong. Now they say
the evidence is inconclusive.
   That's because their measurements of gravity inside a drill hole
in Greenland's ice sheet could have been flawed by variations in the
density of rock beneath the ice, Parker concluded in a study.
   His calculations show ``our results do not need new forces of
nature,'' and can be explained by the existing law of gravity,
Parker said Wednesday during the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting.
   Scientists believed for decades that there were only four
fundamental forces that govern the behavior of all matter in the
universe. They are gravity; electromagnetism, which creates light,
electricity, radio waves and microwaves; the strong force, which
holds the center of atoms together; and the weak force, which lets
some atoms decay radioactively.
   But in 1986, an analysis by Purdue University physicist Ephraim
Fishbach suggested the existence of a very weak ``fifth force'' that
slightly counteracts gravity over distances of roughly 10 to 1,000
yards. The theory gained support from gravity measurements made at
varying depths inside a mine shaft by Frank Stacey of the University
of Queensland, Australia.
   Subsequent gravity measurements made on a North Carolina
television tower and in the Greenland ice hole also suggested there
was a ``sixth force'' that was different than gravity but gave a 1.5
percent to 4 percent boost to gravity's attraction between objects
that were 1,600 to 5,500 feet apart.
   The mine, tower and ice studies all found slight deviations from
Newton's law, which says the gravitational attraction between two
objects decreases with the square of the distance between them. For
example, when two objects that were one foot apart are moved two
feet apart, the gravity they exert on each other should become only
one-fourth as strong.
   Oceanographer Alan Chave, of AT&T Bell Labs, said planned gravity
measurements at varying levels within the ocean should avoid that
problem and help researchers determine whether the new forces are
real.
   If the fifth and sixth forces exist, they might cause inertially
guided missiles to miss their targets by slight distances, said Los
Alamos physicist Michael Nieto. That's why the Air Force conducted
the TV tower experiment.
   Nieto believes that even if the forces found in the experiments
are real, they are not distinct forces of nature, but simply show
gravity is more complicated than Newton thought.
   Existence of fifth and sixth forces also means ``the masses of
the planets and stars, as well as the universe's mass and age, would
have to be recalculated,'' the Geophysical Union said in a news
release.
   Such forces also would change scientists' understanding of ``the
evolution of the universe in its earliest stages'' after it formed
in the gargantuan explosion called the ``big bang,'' said Nieto.
   Physicists believe that before the big bang, the four known
forces existed as a single, ``unified'' force, but that in the
explosion, they instantaneously diverged into separate forces and
matter came into being.
   The ultimate goal of modern physics is to find an elegant
``theory of everything'' that explains all the forces and matter
that make up the universe, and how they evolved from the unified
force.

<HEAD>16,000 Condoms Stolen From Family Planning Clinic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A downtown hospital is investigating the theft of
16,000 prophylactics that has officials puzzled since the condoms
are given away free in the first place.
   The missing condoms, discovered Wednesday by officials at Grady
Memorial Hospital's family planning clinic, temporarily crippled a
program that distributes about 500,000 condoms a year.
   ``It's amazing. They did clean us out,'' said Grady clinic's
director, Dr. Robert Hatcher, on Thursday. ``Maybe those condoms are
in the right hands now.''
   Police believe the theft occurred Tuesday night. Hatcher said he
found his offices trashed and telephones missing when he arrived at
work Wednesday morning.
   ``Then we found out that in our supply room, 16,000 condoms had
been stolen. We ended up with no condoms,'' Hatcher said. ``But most
of our patients maintain a supply at home. We're just telling them
to be careful.''
   News of the theft prompted an Eatontown, N.J. condom
manufacturer, Ansell-Americas Inc., to replace the clinic's supply
free of charge.
   Hatcher said each day his clinic dispenses about 2,000 condoms _
roughly 40 to 160 per patient _ and encourages clients to pass the
condoms on to family members and friends.
   ``Our hope is that those stolen condoms are used so they help
prevent unplanned pregnancies and unwanted infections,'' he said.
   Hatcher, who has served at the Grady clinic for 25 years, said
the condom theft was a first. He urged the bandits to ``come back
and see us again and we'll be glad to help.''

   Fifteen French rescue workers, specialists
in working under disaster conditions, flew today to quake-devastated
Soviet Armenia.
   On Thursday, the Foreign Ministry said two aircraft carrying 180
men, including 22 doctors, had departed for Armenia. Also aboard the
planes were 20 tons of supplies and 12 dogs trained to search for
people trapped in rubble.
   The special fire department team that left today from the Istres
air base in the southern Gard region is made up of five doctors,
five nurses and five rescue specialists.
   The team, members of the Light Intervention and Rescue Element of
the Fire and Rescue Service, specialize in helping authorities
following natural catastrophes. The team participated in the rescue
work after the 1985 earthquake in Mexico city.

   Bidding goodbye after a four-week visit, Soviet
human rights activist Andrei Sakharov called the United States a
wonderful country but said he had no desire to move here.
   ``I think that my fate is completely bound up with the country
where I was born, and I want to live there,'' Sakharov said Thursday
night before boarding a jet to Paris and a possible meeting with
Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   The 67-year-old Nobel laureate also called for an international
effort to aid victims of the massive earthquake that struck Soviet
Armenia, killing tens of thousands of people.
   Sakharov arrived in the United States Nov. 4 as a Soviet delegate
to the International Foundation for the Survival and Development of
Humanity, an organization formed this year by Soviet and American
scientists to foster cooperation on arms control, hunger, pollution
and other issues.
   During his stay, he visited relatives in the Boston area,
attended a private dinner in New York and met with President Reagan
in Washington. He also underwent tests at Massachusetts General
Hospital, where doctors determined he did not need a heart pacemaker.
   It was Sakharov's first visit to the West, and he and others
hailed it as a symbol of change in the Soviet Union.
   ``Just by being able to make the trip he achieved a lot,'' said
Joshua Rubenstein, Northeast regional director for Amnesty
International. ``He showed he could come and that Soviet security
was not threatened as has always been argued.''
   ``Sakharov is a symbol for people who were persecuted from the
late 1960s until the 1980s,'' said Stephen F. Cohen, professor of
Soviet studies at Princeton University. ``It's a sign to people in
the Soviet Union that it's now possible to protest official policies
and still travel freely and move in high circles.''
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, previously
was barred from traveling abroad because of his past scientific
work. He was also restricted to the industrial city of Gorky for
seven years because of his outspoken opposition to Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan.
   In 1986, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev personally called him
back to Moscow. Since then, Sakharov has generally supported
Gorbachev's perestroika, or political and economic restructuring,
while speaking out against some trends, including the growing
concentration of power in Gorbachev's hands.
   Using his stepdaughter, Tatiana Yankelevich, as a translator,
Sakharov said before his departure at Logan International Airport
that ``support for perestroika should be very strong but by no means
unconditional.''
   He warned that perestroika still faces many obstacles and that
the reforms ``cannot yet be called irreversible.''
   He praised Gorbachev's announcement Wednesday of unilateral troop
cuts, saying the Soviet leader ``has taken a very important
initiative ... that will broaden international support for him and
therefore strengthen his position in the Soviet Union.''
   Sakharov, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his
human rights activities, plans to attend a celebration in Paris of
the 40th anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. He said he may also meet with Walesa in France before
returning to Moscow.

   Amid a hasty departure, Mikhail S. Gorbachev
paused to thank New York for its friendliness and speak
optimistically of the prospects for world peace.
   ``The road ahead will be tough but we will go ahead, and we will
_ I believe _ be building on what has been achieved if we act as we
have been acting, and also maybe add something new,'' the Soviet
leader said Thursday as he headed back to Moscow after a disastrous
earthquake in the Soviet south.
   He flew out of New York a day earlier than scheduled and canceled
planned visits to Havana and London because of the massive quake
centered in Armenia that killed tens of thousands of people.
   Although his stay was brief _ 45 hours _ the communist leader
dazzled world leaders with a dramatic troop reduction proposal and
captured the hearts of New Yorkers, who gathered by the thousands
along Manhattan streets to wave and cheer his speeding motorcade.
   The warm feelings were not lost on Gorbachev, who said the kind
of hospitality he experienced showed an ``increasing friendliness
and willingness to cooperate on the part of the Soviet people and
the American people.''
   ``We believe that this may have been one of the most important
things that happened on this day of our stay in America,'' Gorbachev
said before leaving from Kennedy International Airport.
   Gorbachev explained his abrupt departure at an airport news
conference, saying the quake, which registered 6.9 on the Richter
scale, ``had extremely grave consequences, devastation and grave
loss of life.''
   Although he had only ``one working day'' in New York, Gorbachev
said, ``I and my delegation believe that this was a very important
day.''
   The highlights of the visit were Gorbachev's announcement before
the U.N. General Assembly that he planned a major reduction in
Soviet troop strength over the next three years, and his superpower
luncheon with President Reagan and President-elect Bush.
   Gorbachev, the first Soviet chief to visit New York in 28 years,
said his U.N. speech and a later reception gave him the opportunity
to ``set out our views ... on the world today, and on the prospects
of the world's development.''
   Gorbachev called the Governors Island session with Reagan and
Bush ``a good meeting, held in ... an open and trusting atmosphere.''
   He said the one word he would use to characterize it was
``continuity'' and all parties walked away ``confident that our
relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation, on
the basis of mutual respect for each other's interests.''
   Gorbachev later added, ``I think I would be remiss in my duty if
I went home without saying how much we are grateful to New Yorkers,
for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they have been
expressing over these days. ... We value that very much.''
   He had planned to visit the first Soviet trade show in the United
States, Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum on Thursday.
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, canceled a visit with children at an Upper
East Side elementary school.

<DATELINE>LORAIN, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hometown holiday letter-writing campaign
for Terry Anderson ended with more than 17,000 messages of support
for the journalist, who has been held captive in Lebanon for more
than 3{ years, organizers say.
   ``We have encouraged prayers, we have encouraged letters ...
we're getting letters from all over the United States,'' Jack
LaVriha of the Free Terry Anderson Committee said Thursday at a
school vigil marking completion of the drive.
   LaVriha said that although some people think Anderson will not
see the letters, he believes they will be given to him.
   ``The world will be watching,'' LaVriha said. ``I think there's
going to be some compassion shown.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, grew up in Lorain about 30 miles west of Cleveland.
   He was abducted in Beirut on March 16, 1985, and faces his fourth
Christmas in captivity.
   To mark the end of the mail drive, students from the King's
Academy formed a human chain around the school in Elyria for a
silent vigil for Anderson. The vigil lasted four minutes, or one
minute for every year he has been a captive.
   Most of the participants wore yellow, the color which has come to
symbolize hope for a welcome home for Anderson.
   Julie Pellerite, 15, of Olmsted Falls, said she hoped the vigil
would encourage people to become concerned about Anderson's plight.
   The mail will be boxed this weekend and sent to Lebanon through
the efforts of Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, and the State Department.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say of Cadiz, Ky., said he has received
mail in the past, often through a newspaper to which Anderson has
access. The paper has reported messages received on his behalf and
printed some, she said.

<TEXT>
   A Harvard University expert on ancient
Assyria and his church administrator wife have been charged with
sexually assaulting two grandchildren, a prosecutor's spokesman said.
   William Moran, a 64-year-old Harvard professor of Assyriology,
and his 61-year-old wife, Suzanne, administrator of the First
Congregational Church here, were to be arraigned today in Middlesex
Superior Court.
   ``They expect to plead innocent,'' said their attorney, Brackett
Denniston. ``They are innocent and expect to be vindicated after
vigorously contesting the charges.''
   The charges were announced Thursday by Thomas Samoluk, a
spokesman for the Middlesex County district attorney's office.
   The Morans are accused of sexually assaulting their grandchildren
from June 1985 to June 1987, Samoluk said.
   Mrs. Moran is charged with forcible rape of a child under 16
years old and indecent assault and battery on a child under 14 on
various dates. Samoluk said the forcible part of the charge involved
a sharp instrument and threats made to the children that their
parents would be killed if they spoke of the abuse.
   Moran is charged with rape and abuse of a child under 16 and
indecent assault and battery of a child under 14.
   Telephone calls to the church went unanswered Thursday. Mrs.
Moran referred calls to Denniston.
   Margery Heffron, a Harvard spokeswoman, confirmed that Moran was
a professor. She declined to comment further.
   Samoluk said the Massachusetts Department of Social Services and
the district attorney's office were contacted last month after the
children's parents moved to another state and noticed abnormal
behavior in the youngsters.

Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A gynecologist charged by the State Medical
Board with gross immorality for allegedly performing
sexual-enhancement surgery on women without their knowledge says
he's eager to answer the charges.
   Dr. James C. Burt of Dayton was cited Thursday with violating
several provisions of the Medical Practices Act in 78 instances
involving 33 patients dating to March 1966, said Lauren Lubow, a
spokeswoman for the 12-member board.
   Burt, 67, also is being sued by two former patients who claim he
performed sexual-enhancement surgery on them without their knowledge.
   In an interview with a Dayton television station Thursday, Burt
said he had not been notified by the medical board of the charges
against him.
   ``I'm looking forward to answering whatever charges,'' Burt told
WDTN-TV. ``I feel that when the truth comes out that I will be
totally vindicated.''
   Ms. Lubow said Burt, who was banned by the board from surgical
practice in November, has 30 days to seek a public hearing on the
charges. Failing to do so ``would permit the board to construe those
allegations as having been proven,'' she said.
   Burt faces possible penalties ranging from reprimand to
revocation of his license.
   Burt's techniques came under fire in October after CBS' ``West
57th Street'' program investigated his surgical procedures.
   That report and the medical board's citation also referred to
Burt's 1975 book, ``Surgery of Love,'' in which he admitted he had
performed reconstructive surgery aimed at enhancing sexual pleasure
without his patients' knowledge.
   In his book, Burt wrote, ``One doesn't have to go into the
complexity of sexuality with the patient and her partner; one merely
does the operation of coital area reconstruction. ... In many
hundreds of these patients, the patient had not been informed that
anything more had been done to her than delivery and episiotomy and
repair.''
   The board said Burt conducted experimental surgeries that
included rotation of the vagina away from the bladder and internal
genitalia, and extension of the vagina to align it with the
clitoris, an external tissue that responds to sexual stimulation.
   The procedures in many cases resulted in complications,
complaints of sexual dysfunction, infection, a necessity for
corrective surgery and chronic pain, the board said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy has ordered the former
captain of the USS Dubuque court-martialed for allegedly failing to
rescue Vietnamese refugees who claim they later resorted to
cannibalism, a spokesman said today.
   The spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, said no date had been set
for the proceedings against Capt. Alexander G. Balian, 48, of Los
Angeles but that they would probably be held at Subic Bay naval
base, 50 miles west of Manila.
   Balian was relieved of his duties in August after Vietnamese
refugees claimed the Dubuque failed to render assistance when their
boat crossed paths with the warship in the South China Sea on June 9.
   United Nations officials said 52 of the refugees later reached
the Philippines but 58 people died during the 37 day voyage.
Survivors said two Vietnamese died of starvation but that three
others were slain and eaten by fellow passengers.
   Mukri said Rear Adm. Roger L. Rich, commander of U.S. naval
forces in the Philippines, ordered the court-martial after reviewing
findings of an investigation conducted at Subic and in the Persian
Gulf, the Dubuque's destination when it spotted the Vietnamese boat.
   The investigation, which corresponds to a civilian grand jury
probe, was completed Oct. 28 and forwarded to Rich on Nov. 7, Mukri
said. It found that the Vietnamese vessel was out of food and water
and with an inoperative engine and sails when it encountered the
Dubuque.
   Balian claimed that the boat was seaworthy and that the crew
provided food, water and navigational directions.
   Mukri said Balian faced seven charges, including failure to
render assistance to a vessel in distress and failing to determine
the condition of the vessel. Mukri said Balian, who is now in
Sasabo, Japan, could be dismissed from the Navy and imprisoned for
two years on each charge if convicted.
   Mukri said the investigation determined that the Dubuque failed
to provide food, water and clothing, even though some of the
refugees were naked, dehydrated, and weakened from their ordeal at
sea.
   He said Balian was also charged with failing to rescue a
Vietnamese refugee who jumped into the water and tried to swim to
the port side of the Dubuque.
   Mukri said another Vietnamese tried to climb a rope ladder on the
side of the Dubuque, but the crew shook it and he fell back into the
sea.
   The Dubuque also did not report the location of the Vietnamese
vessel by radio so that other ships in the area could render
assistance, Mukri said.
   Quoting the report, Mukri said the Vietnamese vessel left Vietnam
on May 22. By the time it encountered the Dubuque on June 9, there
were 83 men, women and children, including one infant, still alive,
the report said.

   Israeli jets bombed guerrilla posts today
and gunboats sent commando reinforcements ashore in what police said
was a mission to rescue paratroopers captured after landing in this
coastal town.
   Police and the Israeli military said one Israeli officer was
killed and three soldiers were wounded in nine hours of air, naval
and ground fighting about 50 miles north of the Israeli border.
   It was believed to be the deepest Israeli incursion into Lebanon
since September 1983, during the Lebanon war. The Israelis did not
say why they launched a paratrooper raid on the town.
   Police said eight pro-Syrian guerrillas were killed and 16
wounded.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, the apparent target of the attack, said only two of its
fighters were killed and six wounded. It claimed in a communique
that it was holding 17 Israelis and that another Israeli was held by
Syrian troops.
   Police and Israeli military sources said four Israelis were
trapped at one point in the fighting but were rescued. The Israeli
army said no Israeli soldiers were left behind when the fighting
ended.
   Lebanese police said Syrian troops fired at attacking Israeli
jets and sent troop reinforcements to the embattled areas, but they
said there was no evidence the troops were directly involved in the
ground combat.
   The fighting, which police said involved hand-to-hand combat,
raged for nine hours near an abandoned Maronite Catholic monastry
above Naameh, nine miles south of Beirut.
   Palestinian guerrillas ambushed an Israeli force of about 50
paratroopers who landed helicopters in a ravine below the monastry
at 2:10 a.m., one police spokesman in Naameh said.
   Militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party joined the battle an hour later, police said.
   Israeli warplanes then thundered in from the Mediterranean,
blasting guerrilla posts above Naameh in at least 20 sorties. The
Israeli military said an unspecified number of guerrilla command
posts and other targets were destroyed.
   Guerrillas fired shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles, known as
Strellas, at the raiding jets, but no hits were scored, police said.
They said Israeli pilots released hot air balloons to deflect the
heat-seeking missiles.
   Convoys of Syrian military trucks and armored personnel carriers
rolled southward, into the embattled areas on the coastal highway
after Israeli reinforcements stormed ashore about 10 a.m. in landing
craft two miles south of Naameh.
   There was no evidence the Syrian troops were involved in the
actual combat.
   Israel radio, however, quoted Lebanese sources as saying Syrians
opened fire on Israeli troops as they landed on the coast but
stopped firing once the force was fully ashore.
   Israeli gunboats cruised off Naameh and five helicopter gunships
hovered overhead, apparently waiting to evacuate the paratroopers,
the spokesman said.
   Palestinian guerrillas and the leftist Lebanese militiamen were
seen firing at the helicopters from jeep-mounted, anti-aircraft guns
along Naameh's beach.
   The spokesman said the dead Israeli officer commanded the
reconnaissance battalion of Israel's Golani brigade, an elite
infantry force that undertakes most of Israel's special
anti-guerrilla operations in Lebanon.
   Israeli military officials identified him as Lt. Col. Amir Meital.
   Beirut International Airport, on the capital's southern edge, was
closed and incoming flights were diverted to airports in nearby
Damascus, Syria, and Larnaca, Cyprus.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem cabinet of
the country's dual government, instructed Lebanon's ambassador to
the United Nations, Rashid Fakhoury, to lodge a complaint at the
world body against ``this flagrant Israeli aggresssion,'' his press
office said.
   The area where the fighting occurred is controlled by the
pro-Syrian Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, led by Ahmed Jibril, and Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party.
   Many cars were seen speeding out with honking horns from the
stricken bluffs to the coastal highway. They were believed rushing
casualties to hospitals in Sidon and Beirut.
   Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in Beirut as the
planes staged Israel's 24th air raid on Lebanon this year.
   Shopkeepers hurriedly lowered their shutters as hundreds of
Naameh residents scurried to take shelter in basements.
   At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in Israel's 23
previous air raids on Lebanon since Jan. 3.
   The last major Israeli incursion into Lebanon was May 2, when a
force of about 1,500 Israeli troops and allied South Lebanon Army
conducted a two-day sweep into southern Lebanon.
   Three Israeli soldiers and 40 guerrillas were killed in the
operation, the first time a large Israeli force had pushed beyond
the six-to-10 mile deep border security zone since February 1986.

<TEXT>
   Actor David Soul and a former TV news
anchorwoman testified that an ex-policeman convicted of a contract
murder was warm, insightful and great with kids.
   Soul, who starred in the TV show ``Starsky and Hutch,'' and
Christine Lund, a former anchorwoman at KABC-TV in Los Angeles,
spoke on behalf of Robert Von Villas during the penalty phase of the
former Los Angeles police officer's trial. Von Villas could face the
death penalty.
   Miss Lund called Von Villas an ``insightful human being ... who
has immense good in him.''
   Soul described Von Villas as a ``loving, warm person who is great
with kids.''
   Von Villas, 44, of Simi Valley was convicted last month of murder
and conspiracy to murder. He was charged with killing Thomas Weed,
52, in 1983 in exchange for $20,000 from Weed's former wife. Weed's
body has never been found.
   Jurors can recommend that Von Villas be sentenced to death or
life in prison without possibility of parole.
   Another former police officer, Richard Herman Ford, 48, was
convicted Oct. 11 of the same charges in Weed's slaying, but his
jury was unable to reach a decision on his punishment.
   The district attorney's office hasn't decided whether to retry
the penalty phase of Ford's case to seek the death penalty. Without
a retrial, a judge could sentence Ford to life in prison with or
without the possibility of parole.
   Miss Lund testified Wednesday that she met Von Villas when he was
on patrol near her Chatsworth home. She said they became friends,
mainly because both were interested in the problems of children.
   Miss Lund described Von Villas as a devoted family man who had a
``magic touch with kids.''
   Soul testified that he and Von Villas struck up a friendship
after meeting at a ``Starsky and Hutch'' filming location.
   Soul called Von Villas ``a very responsive human being, the kind
of person I like to know, the type I wish there were more of.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cancer rates are declining,but the disease remains
the second leading cause of premature death in the United States,
according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   In 1985, the last year for which statistics were available,
cancer accounted for the loss of 1.95 million years of ``potential
life'' Americans would have had if they had lived to age 65, the
Atlanta-based CDC said Thursday in its weekly report.
   Only injuries, with a loss of 2.2 million years, ranked higher.
   The CDC counts ``years of potential life lost'' to various causes
as a way of measuring premature mortality, using age 65 as a
statistical benchmark. The actual life expectancy is higher.
   Since 1968, the mortality rate from cancer for Americans under 55
has dropped significantly, from 43 deaths per 100,000 people in that
age group in 1968 to 35 in 1985. Over that same time, the annual
rate of potential life years lost has fallen as well, from 1,074
years lost among every 100,000 people to 926.
   ``All of that leads to some guarded optimism _ that cancer rates
in younger people are, in fact, declining,'' said Dr. Richard
Rothenberg, a CDC cancer specialist.
   In the 1985 figures, the highest rate for potential-life years
lost to cancer was among black males, at 1,208 years per 100,000
such people. Following were white males, 949; black females, 877;
and white females, 841.
   But while proportionately fewer people are dying early of cancer,
the population is growing _ particularly ``baby boomers,'' now ages
24-42. Thus, cancer's toll in the total number of ``years of
potential life lost'' has remained virtually constant for two
decades, the CDC noted.
   ``Understanding the basis and public health implications of this
decline (in cancer death rates) requires further investigation,''
the CDC said, noting that such efforts should include study of
cancer incidence and survival among younger Americans.
   Additionally, Rothenberg said, researchers have another concern:
With improvements in other areas of medicine, such as treatment of
cardiovascular disease, Americans are living longer, so the cancer
rate for people over 65 is increasing.
   ``It sounds simplistic, but it means they're living long enough
to get cancer,'' he said.

   Palestinians marked the

   Four Palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops in the

   All 650,000 residents of the Gaza Strip were confined to their
homes under a military curfew imposed Thursday night following
scattered daytime clashes.
   In Gaza City, streets were virtually deserted, but the stench of
tires set ablaze in protest permeated the air.
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, a prayer leader at the main
mosque interrupted his sermon to announce Israeli casualties today
in Lebanon, where Israeli commandos attacked a pro-Syrian
Palestinian guerrilla base.
   ``I have good news for you,'' the Moslem cleric told worshipers.
``An Israeli soldier has been killed.''
   An Israeli announcement, delayed for several hours until the
fighting ended, said combined naval, air and ground forces attacked
the bases of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Throughout the occupied territories, businesses were shuttered
and transportation was halted for a second straight day in
observance of a PLO-ordered general strike to mark the anniversary
of the revolt, which has claimed the lives of 320 Palestinians and
11 Israelis since Dec. 8, 1987.
   Dozens of Palestinian flags flew in the open-air market of
Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, and residents released
balloons in the colors of the outlawed flag, Palestinian reports
said.
   Slogans painted on the walls of the Tulkarem refugee camp
declared: ``Happy New Year to the Intefadeh,'' which means uprising
in Arabic.
   Palestinian demonstrators clashed with troops in the Balata and
Fara refugee camps near Nablus following noon prayers. Hospital
officials said four Palestinians were wounded, including a
22-year-old man shot in the mouth. The army said it was checking the
reports.
   In Jerusalem, four Israeli cars were burned overnight, and police
discovered a Palestinian flag nearby, a police spokesman said. A
note written in Hebrew in support of the uprising also was found,
Israel radio said.
   Two left-wing legislators said in a report today that the
uprising has become institutionalized and is ``gaining in strength''
contrary to army predictions.
   Yossi Sarid and Dedi Zucker of the Citizens' Rights Movement
charged that the 70,000 Jewish settlers living in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip had become ``a garrison force'' seldom called to answer
for their ``wild deeds.''
   According to the report, published in the English-language
Jerusalem Post, 16 Palestinians have been killed by settler gunfire
during the uprising.
   The report also accused the army of doing little to punish troops
who violated standing orders on the treatment of Palestinians.
   It said 600 cases of alleged violations had been opened, but only
20 soldiers brought to trial. The army recently said it has carried
out 45 courts martial and 15 soldiers were given jail terms up to a
year.

   Soviet and American officials ate rum cake
with frosting missiles in a party marking the first anniversary of
the signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty.
   ``Don't let anybody carry that cake outside,'' one partygoer said
Wednesday, joking about Utah's liquor laws. ``We could get busted.''
   In the Soviet city of Votkinsk, American inspectors suspended the
policy prohibiting alcohol after their Soviet escorts brought in
pastries and wine.
   Americans are in the Soviet Union to verify that the Soviets no
longer produce SS-20 missiles at the Votkinsk Machine Building
Plant. The Soviets are here to make sure no more Pershing II
missiles are built at the Hercules Aerospace plant in Magna.
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed
the INF Treaty in Washington on Dec. 7, 1987. The agreement, which
bans medium-range nuclear missiles, took effect in June. Salt Lake
County and Votkinsk are the only two permanent inspection sites
named in the treaty.
   ``What we're doing today is starting a joint cultural tradition,
with the celebration of the signing of the treaty that brings you
here to Utah,'' James Szatkowski, U.S. site commander, said during
the party.
   As many as 30 Soviet inspectors will serve two- and three-month
duty tours for the next 13 years in Salt Lake County under terms of
the treaty.
   ``There's certainly a sense of history in what we're about here
and a sense of pioneering in the area of peace,'' Szatkowski said.
``I think we're all proud to be a part of this exciting time in
international history.''

<HEAD>NATO Leaders Say Soviet Action `Unprecedented Opportunity'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Shultz, Woerner comment on Soviet
arms reduction offer, NATO statement on East-West trade. No pickup.

   NATO foreign ministers today said the
enormous changes under way in the Soviet Union offer an
unprecedented opportunity for improved international relations.
   ``We will continue to seize every opportunity to cooperate in the
search for political solutions to East-West differences,'' the
ministers in a statement ending a two-day meeting of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But they also urged ``tangible and lasting changes'' from the
Soviet Union to help solve the problems dividing East and West.
   The statement cited the announcement Wednesday by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the Soviets will unilaterally
reduce their armed forces by 500,000 troops, or nearly 10 percent,
and withdraw some conventional weapons from eastern Europe. The move
would still leave the Warsaw Pact with more conventional weapons and
troops in Europe than NATO has.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz stressed again that the
allies must maintain a strong defense effort even in the wake of the
Soviet initiatives.
   ``Being encouraged doesn't mean that you just go bananas and
forget about what got you here and so you want to keep doing the
things that are constructive,'' he told a news conference.
   Shultz, who has met with NATO ministers in Brussels and elsewhere
over 6{ years on the job, was attending his last alliance session.
   ``The alliance, it seems to me, is in a very strong position,''
he said. ``It's cohesive, it's informed about what is taking place.''
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said, ``We cannot base our
security on the good or bad intentions or personality of the Soviet
leaders.''
   ``We look upon Mr. Gorbachev with sympathy and encourage his
reform efforts ... while they lead to more human rights and a more
responsible conduct of foreign affairs and a reduction in military
capability,'' he said.
   Gorbachev's address Wednesday at the United Nations, the
ministers said, ``represents the starting point of a new approach by
the Soviet Union to the size and structure of their military forces
and programs.''
   Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British secretary of state for foreign
affairs, said the speech was filled with ``realism and good sense.''
   ``It does offer up encouraging prospects for seeking new
solutions to old problems,'' he told reporters.
   The officials said in their statement they welcomed Gorbachev's
move. ``This implicitly acknowledges our long-held view that
redressing the conventional imbalance is the key to more security
and stability in Europe.''
   The carrying out of these measures, the statement said, ``would
be a very important first step in this direction and reduce, but not
eliminate,'' the imbalances in conventional forces.
   The implementation of the cuts, it said, ``would provide a very
favorable impetus to the conventional stability negotiations.''
   The ministers on Thursday unveiled their position for the
Conventional Stability Talks, due to begin early next year in
Vienna, Austria. The talks will cover the 16 NATO nations and seven
Warsaw Pact countries.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek told reporters that
after Gorbachev's speech ``the climate for the conventional
negotations has considerably improved. Much needs to happen but
things are looking up.''
   Gorbachev made his surprise announcement a day before the
ministers were scheduled to meet at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
   In their final statement, the ministers said their talks took
place ``amid clear signs of change in the internal and external
policies of the Soviet Union and of some of its allies.''
   ``Promising prospects are opening up for an improved East-West
dialogue,'' it said.
   ``We are encouraged by this trend which, if sustained, would
provide us with an unprecedented opportuity to shape a better
international environment reflecting our basic values and the
aspirations of our peoples,'' the statement said.
   In a separate statement, the ministers addressed East-West trade,
saying it must contribute ``to constructive East-West relations
(and) remain consistent with broad allied security concerns.''
   It said trade with the Soviet Union and its allies must be based
on commercially sound terms and mutual advantage. Preferential
treatment must be avoided, it said.
   It also cautioned against economic help that will improve the
Soviet Union's military strength.

<HEAD>Fatal Beating At Church Camp Described</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OREGON CITY, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 8-year-old girl was beaten as many as
500 times, slammed against a wall and dropped on the pavement the
night she died at a church camp, one of four people accused in the
death told authorities.
   The girl, Dayna Lorea Broussard, hid in a corner but the beatings
continued with a hose after a plastic pipe and bamboo cane broke,
Frederick P. Doolittle, 28, told a deputy sheriff.
   The girl was the daughter of Eldridge Broussard Jr., founder of
the Ecclesia Athletic Association that ran the camp at a rural house
southeast of Portland. Broussard also ran the Watts Christian Center
in Los Angeles.
   A tape of an interview Doolittle gave to the deputy the day after
the girl's Oct. 14 death was played Thursday before Clackamas County
Circuit Judge John Lowe, who is considering pre-trial defense
motions to suppress information the defendants provided authorities.
   Charged with manslaughter in the girl's death are Doolittle,
Brian J. Brinson, 30, Constance Jackson, 37, and Willie Chambers, 35.
   Defense lawyers allege in their motion to suppress the
information that the defendants were not properly advised of their
rights.
   Lowe made no decision and said the hearing would continue Monday.
The judge said he was delaying the start of the defendants' trial
until Feb. 6.
   Lowe also released Doolittle and Brinson on their own
recognizance. Jackson and Chambers were released in mid-November.
   On the tape, Doolittle told how he came to Oregon a few days
before the child's death to work at the camp. When he arrived,
Doolittle said Chambers told him Dayna had been a problem and they
would have to discipline her.
   He said Chambers told him the child had stolen some pieces of
chicken she was not supposed to have.
   Doolittle said the beating began Oct. 13 when Jackson pushed the
girl against a wall three to five times, after which the girl said
she was having trouble seeing and was dizzy.
   Doolittle said he and Brinson held the girl down while Chambers
beat her repeatedly with a leather strap, a bamboo cane and a
plastic pipe. Some 250 to 500 blows were delivered, Doolittle said.
   He said the girl also was taken outside and dropped on the
pavement three to five times. At one point she tried to run and hide
in a corner. Jackson then beat her with three extension cords
braided together. Authorities said the beating lasted about 90
minutes.
   The child later was taken to a fire station, where a firefighter
tried to administer first aid.
   After the girl's death, the state took custody of 53 children
living at the camp. Officials said the children were systematically
beaten.

<HEAD>Death Toll At Five From U.S. Jet Crash</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with officials revising death count to
five, West German official saying human error might have caused
crash. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REMSCHEID, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials today revised the death
toll from the crash of a U.S. Air Force jet in Remscheid to five
after discovering that a postman counted among the dead was
hospitalized with severe burns.
   The U.S. military refused to speculate on the cause of the crash
Thursday and opened an investigation.
   However, the West German air force chief of staff, Horst
Jungkurth, told reporters in Bonn he believed the crash was caused
by human error.
   He said the A-10 aircraft was known as highly reliable and that
the chances of a technical problem were ``not very high.'' He said,
``The pilot may have become disoriented when he tried to climb in
heavy cloud cover.''
   Witnesses said the plane flew low over a school and struck the
top floor of an apartment building before bursting into flames.
   Black smoke billowed from the crash site in this central city of
130,000 today. Burned-out cars lined the street. For more than a
block, many buildings were either destroyed or heavily damaged.
   The Remscheid city spokesman, Wilhelm Ellerbrake, told reporters
officials mistakenly reported that six people died in the crash
because they were not aware that the postman was moved to a hospital
in neighboring Bochum.
   Ellerbrake identified the five dead as the lone pilot of the U.S.
plane, two women, aged 86 and 76, and two men, aged 35 and 30.
   The U.S. Air Force identified the pilot as Capt. Michael P.
Foster, 34. It did not give his hometown.
   Peter Becker, a civil defense official in North Rhine Westphalia
state, said workers were searching for more victims. At least 40
people were treated and released, but 11 remained hospitalized from
injuries.
   U.S. Air Force Major Gen. Marcus Anderson said the pilot of the
A-10 Thunderbolt II jet had reported in a last radio transmission 14
minutes after leaving the West German air base at Norvenich that he
had run into bad weather.
   ``He was trying to get out of it by moving up. That was the last
transmission,'' Anderson said today.
   ``In the course of doing so (climbing), the mishap aircraft did
not come out from the top of the clouds and continued in a descent
and ultimately crashed. We do not know why,'' he said.
   Anderson said an Air Force investigation team was trying to
determine the cause of the crash, but said the probe could take up
to 30 days to complete.
   He said the plane was fully loaded with 1,800 gallons of fuel.
   Asked about eyewitness reports that one of the plane's two jet
engines was on fire before it crashed, Anderson said: ``Witnesses
sometimes become confused.'' He also apologized for what he said was
a delay in notifiying local authorities that the aircraft was
carrying ammunition.
   ``That is standard procedure to notify authorities as quickly as
possible. We did have some delay and we regret that very much. We
will investigate what the cause was,'' he said.
   There are no plans to ground the A-10 aircraft unless
investigators determine it had a technical problem, Anderson said.
   Before Thursday's crash, 12 military accidents this year had
claimed 95 lives in West Germany.
   The U.S. Air Force said it was suspending all tactical training
flights in Europe until Tuesday. The West German air force suspended
low-level training flights until the end of the year and called on
its allies to do the same.
   Opposition political parties called for a ban on low-level
flights and sharp cuts in air exercises.
   Opposition to low-level flying grew in August when Italian stunt
planes collided and crashed into a crowd of spectators at an air
show at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein. Seventy people were
killed.

<HEAD>Excerpts From The NATO Communique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the official
English-language communique issued by the NATO foreign ministers
Friday at the end of their two-day meeting at the NATO headquarters:
   Our meeting has taken place amid clear signs of change in the
internal and external policies of the Soviet Union and of some of
its allies. Promising prospects are opening up for an improved
East-West dialogue. We are encouraged by this trend which, if
sustained, would provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to
shape a better international environment reflecting our basic values
and the aspirations of our peoples.
   Among the most promising recent developments is the address made
by President (Mikhail) Gorbachev at the 43rd U.N. General Assembly,
which indicates the extend of change in Soviet policies.
   We will continue to seize every opportunity to cooperate in the
search for political solutions to East-West differences, with a view
to promoting our ultimate aim of a just and lasting peaceful order
in Europe.
   In the pursuit of this endeavor, we look for further tangible and
lasting changes addressing directly the issues dividing East and
West. We reiterate our willingness to work closely with the Soviet
Union and its allies in the search for ways to ease and finally
overcome the painful division of Europe.
   We will continue to evaluate closely the current developments in
eastern Europe, where pressures for movement toward political and
economic reform are mounting. While welcoming progress achieved in
certain areas, we need to take a realistic view of developments.
   The Soviet Union and other Eastern countries still have to meet
fully their obligations on human rights. Nevertheless, we are
encouraged by the recent introduction or announcement of important
measures in this field.
   In the defense area we express the hope that President
Gorbachev's address also represents the starting point of a new
approach by the Soviet Union to the size and structure of their
military forces and programs, which both in the nuclear and
conventional fields still exceed any reasonable defense need.
   --- We attach particular importance to the CSCE (Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe) process, which provides a road
map for stable and constructive relations between East and West and
for a dynamic evolution in Europe.
   We note with regret that a number of governments in the East
still continue to ignore important provisions of the Helsinki Final
Act and the Madrid Concluding Document; full implementation of the
undertakings contained in these documents, including full respect
for human rights, is an essential requirement for genuine peace and
enhancement of mutual confidence.
   We will continue to strive for the conclusion of the CSCE
Follow-Up meeting in Vienna in the immediate future, with a
substantial and balanced concluding document.
   Arms control is an integral part of Alliance security policy. In
expressing full support for the United States position in the START
(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) negotiations, i.e. its aim to
reach a 50 percent reduction in the strategic nuclear forces of the
U.S. and the Soviet Union, we welcome the substantial progress
achieved, including preliminary agreement on key elements, and look
forward to a timely, successful conclusion of these negotiations.
   We reaffirm the importance of the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces) Treaty and welcome its smooth implementation.
   --- We look forward to beginning as soon as possible conventional
stability negotiations, within the framework of the CSCE process,
with the objective of establishing a secure and stable balance of
forces at lower levels, between the 23 members of the two military
alliances in Europe. We want a situation in Europe in which force
postures, as well as numbers and deployments of weapons systems, no
longer make a surprise attack and a large-scale offensive action a
feasible option, an option which we have never possessed or desired.
   Our vision remains a continent where military forces should only
exist to prevent war and to ensure self-defense, not for the purpose
of military aggression and not for the purposes of political or
military intimidation. We therefore welcome the latest pronouncement
by the Soviet leadership regarding significant reductions of Soviet
conventional forces in Europe and re-structuring of the remaining
forces.
   This implicitly acknowledges our long-held view that redressing
the conventional imbalance is a key to more security and stability
in Europe. Implementation of these measures would be a very
important first step in this direction and reduce, but not
eliminate, the conventional imbalances. In particular, it would
provide a very favorable impetus to the conventional stability
negotiations.
   The conventional stability talks will be accompanied by distinct
negotiations on further confidence-building measures among the 35
CSCE participants. Such negotiations will have to build upon and
expand on the results of the Stockholm Conference, which marked a
significant step toward increasing transparency and contributed to
greater confidence and predictability of military activities in
Europe. We look to the countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization
and other participating states to reciprocate this effort.
   --- The member states participating in the MBFR (Mutual and
Balanced Force Reduction) talks emphasize their agreement to the
continuation of these talks until a new mandate for negotiations on
conventional stability has emerged. They also agreed these talks
should be concluded before the start of new negotiations.
   We reiterate our full commitment to the goal of an early
conclusion of a truly worldwide, comprehensive and effectively
verifiable ban on chemical weapons.
   --- We reaffirm our commitment to share fairly the risks, burdens
and responsibilities, as well as the benefits, of our participation
in the alliance. This commitment to equitable sharing is a
fundamental principle of the alliance and a prerequisite for
maintaining its cohesion and solidarity. We all attach great
importance, in an evolving political, trade and economic environment
to maintaining balance and equity in our partnership.

   Armenian immigrants flooded telephone lines in mostly futile
attempts to learn whether their kin survived the catastrophic Soviet
earthquake, while Armenian-American organizations pressed Moscow to
begin relief flights today.
   Throughout the country, Armenian-Americans continued to mobilize
swift relief efforts for survivors of the quake that killed tens of
thousands and devastated several cities in Soviet Armenia.
   From Los Angeles, where the nation's largest Armenian-American
community resides, a relief plane was to leave today for Boston,
where it was to pick up additional supplies and depart for the
Soviet Union, said Philip Hovnanian, president of the Armenian
Missionary Association of America, an umbrella group for Armenian
religious and community organizations.
   State Department clearance was given, but approval from Moscow
hadn't been obtained late Thursday, Hovnanian said.
   ``We are optimistic,'' he said from New York. ``This is a humane,
Christian mission.''
   Hovnanian said he feared Moscow was withholding its permission
for American relief flights because of the ethnic unrest plaguing
the Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   ``The Soviet government may fear this situation may give
opportunity for some (American) Armenians to become politically
involved.'' But, he added, ``The size of the devastation is so big
they should welcome all help.''
   Two Southern California doctors said they were flying to Armenia
with a Red Cross team to spend up to 10 days lending support. Dr.
Garo M. Tertzakian of Santa Ana and Dr. Vartkes Najarian of La
Crescenta hoped to arrive in Armenia on Saturday.
   Many churches in New Jersey planned special services Sunday for
quake victims.
   ``We've been receiving phone calls all day from people who want
to know what they can do to help,'' said the Rev. Arnak Kasparian,
pastor of St. Thomas' Armenian Church in Tenafly, N.J.
   In the Soviet Union, Armenian journalists said a Politburo
commission received preliminary estimates that up to 50,000 people
died in Wednesday's earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the Richter
scale.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cut short his trip to the United
States and flew home to lead a worldwide emergency rescue effort in
the southern republic, which has a population of 3.3 million.
   ``The immediate needs are shelter, medical supplies, clothing and
blood,'' Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese
of the Armenian Church in America, said at a news conference at New
York's Armenian cathedral.
   Manoogian and a delegation of Armenian prelates from around the
world held the news conference after a one-hour meeting with Soviet
officials at the USSR mission to the United Nations.
   As news of the quake's magnitude spread, the nation's Armenian
communities struggled to contact relatives in the Soviet Union.
   ``We can't reach Armenia,'' said Suren Bursalyan, editor of the
Los Angeles Armenian biweekly, Paros. ``All of the phone lines are
shot. Our only information is American television.''
   Tamara Sulukhyia, a Soviet exchange student at Bowdoin College in
Maine, did get through to her parents. She said the earthquake had
spared her family. ``I talked with my parents and I asked, `Is it
true or not?' and they answered that it was a very hard
earthquake,'' Sulukhyia said.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian, himself of Armenian descent,
offered his sympathy.
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this very
difficult time,'' Deukmejian said. ``As Californians, we are all too
familiar with devastating earthquakes.''
   In Southern California, the Western Prelacy of the Armenian
Apostolic Church announced eight days of mourning would begin today,
and that local Armenian churches would hold special requiem services
today and Sunday.
   ``They are in a state of shock,'' Archbishop Datev Sarkissian
said. ``They are in a state of grief and great pain.''
   Southern California is home to at least 250,000 Armenians, the
largest concentration outside of Soviet Armenia. Most local
Armenians reside in Hollywood and the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale.
   In Watertown, Mass., where many of the state's estimated 90,000
Armenians live, the first feeling to sweep the community was
despair, said Ara Kalaydjian, editor of the Armenian Mirror
Spectator.
   ``But now it's changed into determination to build again and not
for decades _ for centuries,'' Kalaydjian said.
   In Detroit, local relief efforts got a strong boost from
industrialist Alex Manoogian, international president of the
Armenian General Benevolence Union, who contributed $500,000 for
emergency medical supplies.
   Edmond Azadian, Manoogian's chief assistant, said some
Detroit-area Armenians were trying to fly to their homeland to
personally check up on loved ones.
   ``Everybody is scrambling to charter airplanes and get permission
from the Soviets to get there as soon as possible,'' he said.

   Scattered snow fell today from northern Arkansas to parts of
Kentucky and Tennessee and the southern Appalachians as strong winds
continued blowing through Arizona and Southern California.
   In Virginia, thousands of school children were kept home as up to
6 inches of snow fell from the north to the southwest, slickening
roads and causing power outages.
   Snow, sleet and freezing rain left roads in southwest Texas slick
today, and more precipitation was expected. A winter weather
advisory was in effect.
   A snow advisory was in effect for southern New Mexico after the
state's south-central mountains got up to 13 inches of snow. Snow
advisories also were in effect for the northern mountains of North
Carolina and parts of Tennessee.
   Locally heavy snow was expected in parts of the Great Lakes
region.
   A winter storm warning was in effect for northeast Ohio. And in
New York state, a snow squall warning was out for counties east of
Lake Ontario, where 6 inches of snow were expected.
   In Michigan, snow-making machines have been pumping out
artificial flakes for weeks, but ski resort workers awoke today to
up to 4 inches of natural snow.
   ``It was unnatural, to go so long without much snow. It scared
me,'' said Paula Brown, a receptionist at Sugar Loaf Resort in
Cedar, 15 miles northwest of Traverse City.
   Some light snow fell today in western Montana and parts of Idaho.
   Light rain lingered in eastern Texas, southern Arkansas and parts
of Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama, as well as the Pacific
Northwest.
   Strong winds in Arizona and Southern California were generated by
a strong high-pressure system over the Rockies and a low-pressure
system in the Gulf of California.
   A high-wind warning remained in effect for the mountains and
coastal areas of Southern California, and a wind advisory for the
deserts of Southern California and extreme western Arizona.
   Today's forecast called for rain from the Middle Atlantic States
to the Carolinas, Georgia, the Gulf Coast states and eastern and
central Texas; snow in western Texas and southeast New Mexico, and
from the Great Lakes to the northern and central Appalachians, as
well as in eastern Montana and western sections of the Dakotas; fog
in the central San Joaquin Valley of California and parts of Nevada.
   High temperatures were predicted in the single digits in
northeast Minnesota; teens and 20s from eastern Montana to the
Dakotas, the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes region and
northern New England; 50s from the Carolinas to the central Gulf
Coast and southern Texas; 60s to the lower 80s in Florida; 50s and
60s across the desert Southwest and much of California with some 70s
along the Southern California coast; and 30s and 40s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 13
degrees below zero in Hibbing, Minn., to 72 in Miami, Key West and
Homestead Air Force Base, Fla.

   A University of Wisconsin student was
arrested after taking a police officer's gun and urging fellow
demonstrators to cross a police line to protest CIA job recruiting,
authorities said.
   James C. Carl, 26, was arrested Thursday and put in jail on
tentative charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and
disarming a police officer, police said.
   Carl was among 25 demonstrators who tried to interrupt job
recruiting appointments by the Central Intelligence Agency at the
university's College of Engineering. CIA representatives make annual
visits to the university and other campuses around the country.
   Carl was arrested while urging other protesters to break through
a police line, said university police and security Sgt. David
Williams.
   The student removed a revolver from an officer's holster during a
struggle with officers attempting to arrest him for disorderly
conduct, Williams said.
   There were no injuries or other arrests.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II urged today that the rights
of minorities be respected, but he also condemned any recourse to
violence to advance their claims and lashed out at terrorist groups
acting in their name.
   ``May those who follow the inhuman path of terrorism hear my
voice: to strike blindly, kill innocent people or carry out bloody
reprisals does not help a just evaluation of the claims advanced by
the minorites for whom they claim to act,'' the pope said in his
message for the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of Peace.
   The message, sent to world leaders each year, was titled ``To
Build Peace, Respect Minorities.''
   Vatican officials said the message was in general terms and that
John Paul had no specific ethnic, racial, religious or national
group in mind, although his words seemed directed at a number of
situations in the world.
   The pope acknowledged that ``delicate problems arise'' when a
group seeks independence or greater political autonomy.
   ``I wish to state that, in such delicate circumstances, dialogue
and negotiation are the obligatory path to peace,'' he said, adding
that a refusal to enter into dialogue ``can open the door to
violence.''
   He also declared that states that perpetrate or tolerate acts
aimed at endangering the lives of minorities, violate ``the
fundamental law governing the social order.''
   In situations of real injustice, he said it may be the duty of
groups which have emigrated to demand justice for oppressed in their
homelands. But he called for care ``especially when it is difficult
to have objective information.''
   The church marks its World Day of Peace on Jan. 1 but the pope's
message is traditionally issued in advance.

<HEAD>Soweto City Council Drops Campaign To Crush Rent Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city council of the black
township of Soweto has agreed to halt evictions and write off
arrears stemming from a massive, 3-year-old rent boycott, prominent
anti-apatheid activists said today. The activists, who met with the
council for several hours, included Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, miners' union leader Cyril Ramaphosa and others who in the
past have refused to negotiate with the black councilors of the
township near Johannesburg.
   The rent boycott, launched to press a broad range of grievances
against the government, has evolved into one of the most effective
forms of protest still available to blacks under a 30-month-old
state of emergency.
   Authorities have used numerous tactics in futile attempts to
break the boycott, including late-night eviction raids such as one
in August 1986 which led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a
confrontation with police.
   The new council took office following nationwide municipal
elections Oct. 26 which were the target of an illegal but successful
boycott by blacks. About 11.5 percent of eligible voters in Soweto
cast ballots.
   South Africa's black majority is excluded from Parliament, and
black local councils have been denounced by activists as subordinate
extensions of the white-dominated political system.
   The new council, seeking to differentiate itself from its
predecessor, proceeded to rehire municipal workers fired during a
strike and said it wanted to consult with community leaders to
resolve problems facing the township of 2.5 million people.
   Today's meeting came two days after South Africa's highest court
ruled that previous Soweto councils had no legal authority to
collect rent from occupants of the thousands of homes built in the
1940s and 1950s by the city council of Johannesburg. At that time,
there was no separate black administration in Soweto.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general of the South African
Council of Churches and leader of the activists' delegation, said
the councilors agreed that because of the court ruling, no Sowetan
was required to pay any of the millions of dollars of rent withheld
during the boycott.
   Chikane said further negotiations would take place to determine
whether some residents should now be awarded ownership of their
houses and what type of rent or service charges should be paid in
the future. In the interim, he said, residents should not pay any
rent.
   The rent boycott was launched in townships south of Johannesburg
in 1985 and spread to dozens of communities nationwide. Overdue rent
in Soweto alone is believed to exceed $100 million.
   Chikane and Tutu indicated the new council was viewed more
positively by activists than its predecessors.
   ``They told us our grievances were their grievances,'' said Tutu.
   The activists said in a statement that negotiations with the
council would continue only if it were able to guarantee community
leaders were not harassed or detained as they consulted with
residents.
   One of the consequences of the five-month municipal workers'
strike was an accumulation of trash on roadsides throughout Soweto.
   The council will launch a clean-up campaign Saturday, and it drew
praise from the normally critical local newspaper, The Sowetan, for
a proposal to pay children to join the effort.

   The family of a teen-ager killed
when a whirling carnival ride collapsed has filed a $10 million
lawsuit against the ride's owner and the Broward County Fair.
   Christie Schafale, 17, of Cooper City was killed and six people
were injured when an arm of The Monster ride collapsed Nov. 23. An
initial investigation found that a crack in the arm had been painted
over.
   ``The family has just suffered profoundly,'' Shafale's attorney,
Murray Sams Jr., said Thursday.
   The Broward Circuit Court lawsuit accuses the fair and the ride's
owner, the James E. Strates Shows of Orlando, of careless and
reckless disregard for the riders' safety by failing to properly
inspect the ride, repair the crack and warn the public of the
allegedly hazardous conditions.
   Strates lawyer Peter Wechsler said he had not seen the lawsuit
and could not comment.
   The fair's attorney, Steven Reininger, said the fair probably
will argue that Strates was an independent contractor charged with
the responsibility to maintain safe rides.

<DATELINE>RABAT, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. locust-spraying plane was shot down
near where Marxist rebels have been fighting Morocco for an
independent Western Sahara, and officials said all five people
aboard were presumed killed.
   A second DC-7, also from the U.S. Agency for International
Development, was damaged in Thursday's anti-aircraft missile attack
over Mauritania but was able to land at a remote airstrip in
Morocco. No one aboard that plane was injured.
   Marxist guerrillas of the Polisario Front may have fired at the
four-engine propeller-driven planes, official sources in this North
African country said on condition of anonymity.
   The guerrillas are known to have been armed with Soviet-made SA-6
and SA-7 surface-to-air missiles. Both the Moroccan and Mauritanian
armed forces also have such anti-aircraft missiles.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, and a U.S. Embassy
spokesman in Rabat said an investigation was under way.
   ``The five crew members of the downed aircraft, all of whom are
American citizens, are presumed dead,'' an AID statement from
Washington said.
   Both aircraft were owned by T & G Aviation of Chandler, Ariz.,
and were under contract to AID to spray insects, said T & G co-owner
Sergio Tomassoni, who was in the other plane that was hit.
   Tomassoni, 64, spoke with reporters by telephone from his hotel
room in Agadir, Morocco.
   He identified those aboard the downed plane as Joel Blackmer, 46,
and Blackmer's son, Frank Kennedy, 21, both of Phoenix; Ben Rossini,
49, Tempe, Ariz.; Frank Hederman, 47, Cody, Wyo.; and Wes Wilson of
Nebraska. Tomassoni did not know Wilson's age or hometown.
   Tomassoni described the two-hour trip in the crippled plane to
the next airfield as ``hairy.''
   ``We were just flying along at about 11,000 feet when, all of a
sudden, the first airplane was hit,'' Tomassoni said. ``We saw the
smoke and a big ball of fire. One of the engines was in flames. The
plane started losing altitude, and then the right wing blew off. I
knew they were in trouble, but we had problems of our own.''
   ``We were 25 to 30 feet above the ground most of the way. We had
a load of insecticide aboard, and we dumped it and were able to gain
some altitude,'' Tomassoni added. ``We made an emergency landing at
an airfield in a town about 80 miles south of Agadir.''
   A caller identifying himself as Madjid Abdullah, Polisario's
North American representative in Washington, said the front ``will
do everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and
unfortunate incident.''
   ``We are not sure really who shot it down,'' he said in a phone
call to The Associated Press in New York. ``The Polisario Front has
no interest in creating problems with the United States.''
   He said Morocco must assume responsibility for the attack because
it directed civilian planes over an area with a ``huge
concentration'' of Polisario troops.
   The area where the plane was shot down is 650 miles southwest of
Rabat, the Moroccan capital.
   The DC-7s were used for spraying locust swarms in Senegal, which
borders Mauritania to the south, AID spokesman Bart Kull said in
Washington. Locust infestations have ravaged much of northern Africa
this year.
   The planes left Dakar, Senegal, earlier Thursday and were bound
for Agadir when they came under fire from ground-to-air missiles,
the embassy spokesman said.
   Moroccan government officials said the two planes were attacked
while they were flying at an altitude of 10,000 to 11,000 feet in an
international navigation corridor over Bir Moghrein, northern
Mauritania.
   The Moroccan sources said officials were trying to locate the
downed plane's wreckage, which they said could have scattered over a
wide area.
   Mauritania lies east of the Western Sahara, a former Spanish
colony. Morocco annexed part of the Western Sahara in 1976 and the
remaining territory three years later, when Mauritania withdrew from
it.
   For 13 years, the desolate border region has been the scene of a
guerrilla war waged by the Polisario Front to establish an
independent Western Sahara.
   The United Nations is mediating talks between Morocco and the
rebels.
   In Washington, FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney said his agency was
checking to see if it might have jurisdiction to investigate. In
1986, Congress passed the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and
Anti-Terrorist Act, which made it a crime for any terrorist group to
assault or kill an American anywhere in the world.

   A former television preacher's allegations
that he had sex with PTL founder Jim Bakker are ``lies'' from a
``former good friend,'' Tammy Faye Bakker says.
   Mrs. Bakker denied the charges against her husband by John Wesley
Fletcher, a former co-host of ``The PTL Club,'' in an interview
Thursday with TV talk show host Sally Jessy Raphael.
   ``I've lived with this man for 27 years and I know he's not
(bisexual),'' Mrs. Bakker said during the show.
   Mrs. Bakker agreed to appear on the show after Raphael promised
not to do a planned show with Fletcher, said Burt Dubrow, executive
producer of the ``Sally Jessy Raphael Show.'' The interview with
Mrs. Bakker will be aired Dec. 19.
   Fletcher, who appeared on ``The PTL Club'' from the mid-1970s to
1981, said in an interview for January's Penthouse magazine: ``I was
Jim Bakker's male prostitute.'' Bakker, who was indicted this week
on federal charges of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy, has denied
in a sworn deposition that he has ever had a homosexual
relationship, and has denied charges of financial wrongdoing.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting he had a
sexual encounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and paying her
hush money.
   With her husband watching the taping on a tiny monitor in the
driveway outside the couple's leased 14-room log cabin, Mrs. Bakker
talked about the pain she has suffered during the past two years,
including being humiliated when people at shopping malls and
restaurants ridiculed her and her husband.
   ``Sometimes I wish we could just move away to another planet,''
she said tearfully.

<TEXT>
   Nobel laureate Andrei D. Sakharov today called for
more steps to reduce the size of the Soviet military and appealed
for massive help for the victims of the earthquake in the Armenian
republic.
   Sakharov, arriving to attend a celebration marking the 40th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said one
way to cut down the Soviet military would be to limit the length of
service for Soviet draftees.
   Commenting on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's offer
Wednesday to cut the Red Army by 500,000 men and withdraw thousands
of tanks and troops from Eastern Europe, he said it was a major
decision but only a beginning.
   The human rights activist and nuclear physicist said reductions
in manpower and weapons ``can be done and will change in a major way
the international situation. Gorbachev is going in this direction
and this is very important. I would have liked to see bigger cuts
but what was done is important.''
   Sakharov, 67, spoke at a 90-minute news conference at the Soviet
Embassy.
   He twice sidestepped questions about the political implications
of a meeting he is expected to have with Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, who left Poland for Paris today to attend the anniversary
celebration.
   Speaking about Wednesday's devastating earthquake in Armenia,
Sakharov said volunteers were needed from all over the world to help
victims. He said he was certain Soviet authorities would welcome all
the help they could get.
   ``All other things have to take second place,'' Sakharov said,
including the ethnic unrest between Armenian and the neighboring
Azerbaijan republic that has forced an estimated 180,000 people to
flee the two republics.
   Sakharov, a founder of the Soviet dissident movement, talked at
length about Gorbachev's political and economic restructuring, known
as ``perestroika,'' saying it ``cannot yet be called irreversible.''
   For the West, he said, the failure of perestroika would be
dangerous. ``There will be a loss of internal stability in the
Soviet Union and therefore of stability in the world because the
pendulum would swing the other way in an expansionist direction,''
Sakharov said.
   He said the West should support perestroika but not
unconditionally.
   Sakharov arrived from Boston, where he had been visiting
relatives. He was to be joined tonight by his wife, Yelena Bonner,
who was en route from Moscow. Mitterrand invited the recent winners
of the Nobel Peace Prize. Walesa won the prize in 1983, Sakharov in
1975.
   Mitterrand and U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
will speak at the celebrations Saturday at the Palais Chaillot on
the Seine River.

   The National Geographic Society is winding down
its centennial year facing financial problems, with staff reductions
planned and some book publications curtailed.
   The cutbacks were disclosed in a memo to staffers from Gilbert M.
Grosvenor, chairman of the society.
   Grosvenor said he would strive to make the staff reductions
``primarily through attrition and the transfer of regular staff
members.''
   Spokeswoman Barbara Moffett said today reductions are needed in
the wake of a financial report showing a sharp decline in the
society's year-end picture.
   The reductions could affect about 100 of the society's 2,500
workers, according to The Washington Post.
   Two children's book series will be affected by the cutbacks, Ms.
Moffett said..
   Books for World Explorers is being discontinued, she said. A
second series, Books for Young Explorers, will still be published,
but the volumes offered will be reprints of ``classics'' from the
past, she said, with no new one being developed for the time being.
   Grosvenor's memo Thursday noted that the society has employed a
large number of people on special projects in recent years, and
``such personnel will normally be phased out as these activities are
completed.''
   Indications are that the society will complete 1988 about $2
million in the black, compared to a $29 million surplus last year.
   The society, which publishes National Geographic magazine, has
had large expenses this year, including a major effort to improve
geography education, expenses for its birthday celebration and a
costly holographic cover _ a three-dimensional representation
produced with a laser _ on its December magazine.
   In addition, Grosvenor said in his memo that direct mail
promotion seems to have reached a saturation point for society
membership.
   And the nation's demographics are changing, he pointed out. The
decline in the nation's birth rate has reduced the audience for some
society publications aimed at children, for example.

   A cancer researcher visiting his 3-year-old
daughter in state custody sprayed a Mace-like substance at four
social workers and abducted the girl, police said.
   Warrants have been issued charging William Edgar Stewart II, 48,
with aggravated battery and interfering with child custody and
accusing his wife, Kimberly Denmark Stewart, 21, with custody
interference, said police Capt. S.A. Brock.
   The child was taken into protective custody after Stewart, a
professor at the University of South Florida, was accused by the
state Health and Rehabilitative Services Department of misconduct
toward her, Brock said.
   HRS spokesman Tony Edwards declined to elaborate on the case
because such records are confidential. He said the girl had been in
state custody for more than a week.
   Social worker Judy Ann Chambers was supervising the couple's
visit Thursday when Mrs. Stewart, the child's stepmother, excused
herself only seconds before a fire alarm sounded, Brock said.
   Employees from an alarm company were working on the system and
activated it as a test. Not realizing the alarm was being tested,
state workers began filing outside.
   When Stewart, his daughter and Ms. Chambers reached a first-floor
landing, the social worker told him he could not leave the building
with the girl, officials said.
   ``Then the father sprayed a substance such as Mace into the face
of the counselor and ran out of the building with the child,'' Brock
said. Three other child care workers standing nearby also were
sprayed. All four were treated and released at a hospital.
   The Stewarts were seen driving off in a car with Georgia license
plates.

   Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan is
responding to treatment for pneumonia and may miss only one court
session, a court spokeswoman said today.
   Kathy Arberg, the spokeswoman, said Brennan ``is continuing to
improve and is resting comfortably.''
   Brennan, at 82 the oldest member of the court, was taken to the
Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban Maryland on Thursday after
visiting a doctor at the U.S. Capitol, court spokeswoman Toni House
said.
   ``Justice Brennan was admitted with pneumonia,'' she said. ``He
is being treated with antibiotics, and doctors expect him to respond
very well.''
   Ms. House added, ``His illness is not expected to affect his work
except for the Monday, Dec. 12, session.''
   The court is scheduled to begin a four-week recess after issuing
orders and possibly announcing decisions Monday.
   Ms. House declined to answer other questions concerning the
justice's health or his hospitalization.
   A spokesman for the medical center would confirm that Brennan is
a patient there but declined to offer any information about his
condition.
   A court employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity
said Brennan left his court office in the early afternoon, suffering
from a fever and the chills.
   Brennan participated in the court's oral arguments Wednesday, and
reportedly has enjoyed good health recently.
   His last hospitalization occurred in August 1987 when he checked
into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for tests on his prostate
gland.
   The tests revealed he did not have cancer.
   ``Although the prostate is somewhat enlarged, the condition is
not malignant and no surgery is required,'' Brennan said in a
statement issued by the court at that time.
   In 1979 Brennan had a stroke that left his right hand partially
paralyzed, and a year earlier he was treated for a cancerous growth
on a vocal cord.
   Brennan, appointed to the nation's highest court by President
Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, is its oldest and most senior member.
   For three decades the court's leading liberal light, Brennan is
now one of three liberal, octogenarian justices. Thurgood Marshall
and Harry A. Blackmun are 80.
   By comparison, the average age of the court's conservative
justices is about 60.
   Such demographics have fueled speculation about President-elect
Bush's impact over the next four years on a court deeply divided
over such politically explosive issues as abortion and affirmative
action.
   Supreme Court justices are appointed to life terms by the
president. The appointments must win Senate confirmation.

<HEAD>State Court Orders 17-Year-Old Tried As Adult In Family Ax Murders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A teen-ager accused of slaying his
parents, brother and sister with an ax must be tried as an adult
because of public safety concerns, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled
today.
   The Supreme Court justices unanimously affirmed a ruling of the
state Court of Appeals in the case of David Brom, 17, of Rochester.
   The ruling said the state had ``met its burden of proving by
clear and convincing evidence that D.F.B. (Brom) is unamenable to
treatment in the juvenile court system consistent with the public
safety.''
   A lower court judge had ruled that Brom should be tried as a
juvenile.
   Brom is accused of killing his parents, Bernard and Paulette
Brom, both 41; his sister, Diane, 13, and a brother, Ricky, 11. The
bodies were found Feb. 18 in the family's home north of Rochester.
Each had died of multiple blows with an ax, authorities said.
   Brom was 16 at the time of the slayings. He turned 17 on Oct. 3.
   The Court of Appeals concluded that the lower court judge had
misinterpreted the effect of a 1980 amendment to juvenile criminal
justice law. The Appeals Court decided that keeping Brom in the
juvenile court system was inconsistent with the Legislature's intent.
   ``There can be no doubt that the offenses here are heinous and
that the only fair response of the criminal justice system, as a
matter of law, must be referral'' to adult court, the Appeals Court
said.
   Brom was arrested Feb. 19 and has been undergoing treatment at
the Oaks Treatment Center in Austin, Texas, a facility for severely
disturbed children.
   If found guilty in juvenile court, he would have been subject to
state custody until his 19th birthday. A conviction of first-degree
murder in adult court carries a mandatory life sentence, with
eligibility for parole after 17{ years.

<HEAD>Report: Significant Weaknesses In New York Subway's Emergency
Preparedness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARJORIE ANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inspection prompted by last year's fatal
London subway fire found many weaknesses in fire safety precautions
and emergency preparedness in New York's subways.
   Eleven of the subway system's 48 escalators lack sprinklers,
about one quarter of the token booths inspected have inadequate
emergency communications equipment and about half the fire
extinguishers that are supposed to be along the tracks are missing
or empty, according to a report on the inspection released Thursday.
   The fire in the London Underground, which killed 31 people, began
when someone dropped a lighted match on a wooden escalator. The New
York subway system does not have wooden escalator treads.
   After the London fire, the New York City Transit Authority
reactivated an old contract to install sprinklers at all 48
escalators at a cost of $5.7 million, but a month later called off
the project because of budget concerns.
   The New York subway system has not had a fire like the one at
King's Cross Station in London, but it averages 5,000 blazes a year,
mostly minor car and track fires caused by rubbish.
   Larry Reuter, the Transit Authority's vice president for rapid
transit, said that since the audit, his agency has made safety
improvements and plans more.
   The audit found 11 of the subway system's escalators are not
equipped with sprinklers and warned that inadequate cleaning allows
flammable debris and grease to build up beneath them.
   There have been three escalator fires in the past five years, two
in escalators without sprinklers. Both apparently were sparked by
cigarettes, although smoking is illegal in the subway system.
   Since the audit, the Transit Authority has intensified its
escalator maintenance, Reuter said.
   The audit also found that of the 118 token booths checked, 28 had
neither a working emergency communication system nor a substitute
auxiliary phone. These systems are used to contact the Transit
Authority command center, which is responsible for calling the Fire
Department.
   Reuter said an $11.8 million contract to replace the transit
booth communications systems has been awarded.
   Transit Authority President David Gunn wrote in his response to
the inspection that the authority is trying to deter thefts of fire
extinguishers.
   ``Locking or otherwise securing extinguishers in the tunnels was
deemed unacceptable,'' he said. ``Police stakeouts also are
utilized. This situation is still being studied.''

<TEXT>
   The Kentucky Court of Appeals today ordered
the state Board of Claims to hold hearings on a group of claims
filed against the state after the 1977 Beverly Hills Supper Club
fire that killed 165 people.
   The board had dismissed the claims without notice in 1987, saying
it had the ``inherent'' power to do so and that it would not have
been liable to the claimants, anyway.
   But the appeals court said in a precedent-setting opinion that
the board and similar administrative agencies, unlike courts, ``have
no `inherent' powers.''
   ``The Board of Claims is entirely a creature of the legislature.
... There is no explicit grant of authority (in Kentucky law) giving
the board the power to take on an adversarial role and dismiss
claims'' on its own motion, the court said in a 2-1 ruling.
   The board was created by the General Assembly to handle damage
claims against state agencies, which under the Kentucky Constitution
cannot be sued for negligence.
   The fire on May 28, 1977, led to years of litigation against
dozens of companies that manufactured materials used in the
construction or furnishing of the club at Southgate, just across the
Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio.
   In July 1985, General Electric Co. became the last of 14
defendants in a federal civil suit against aluminum wiring
manufacturers to reach settlements totaling $14 million. Settlements
by other defendants had totaled $30 million by 1984.
   The appeals court upheld Campbell Circuit Court, which earlier
had consolidated the claims by the estates of seven people into a
single case and ordered it back to the board for hearing. The board
appealed that ruling.
   Failure to give the claimants notice of dismissal or to allow
them to respond with legal arguments was a violation of the
constitutional guarantee of due legal process, the appellate panel
said.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old stowaway who wanted to go to
American but ended up in Australia by mistake arrived back in Vienna
today at the end of a 19,000-mile airborne adventure.
   Kristofer Dobrowski was questioned by police and then handed back
to his Polish-born mother, officials at Schwechat airport told The
Associated Press. His home address was not released.
   Airline officials were at a loss to explain the incident but said
they were checking security systems.
   Dobrowski was put on a Vienna-bound plane in Australia late
Thursday after he was discovered in the transit lounge of Sydney's
airport without a ticket, travel papers or identity documents.
   ``He is knee-high to a grasshopper,'' said one Australian
immigration officer. ``It seems he wanted to go to America and
mistook the Qantas flight destination of Melbourne for Miami.''
   With the help of an interpreter, officials found that Dobrowski
had flown undetected from Vienna to Bangkok, and on to Hong Kong and
Melbourne before being picked up in Sydney.
   Immigration spokesman Geoff Smith said officials became
suspicious when they realized the boy spoke no English, was
traveling alone and had no travel documents.
   Dobrowski, who is Polish but lives with his mother in Vienna,
said he was unhappy at his mother's recent remarriage. He said he
did not like his stepfather, so he decided to run away.
   ``He left home Saturday and went to Vienna Airport where he
somehow boarded an Air Lauda jet for Bangkok and Hong Kong,'' said
the spokesman. ``He stayed in Hong Kong for two days in the transit
area, mostly sleeping while he recovered from his flight from Europe
to Asia.''
   When he overcame his jetlag, Dobrowski tagged along with a family
that was flying to Australia, apparently managing to pick up a
boarding pass he found on the ground and use it to join a flight to
Melbourne.
   ``But Australia wasn't Kristofer's chosen destination. With his
poor understanding of English, he mistook Melbourne for Miami, which
is where he really wanted to go _ America,'' said the official
demanded anonymity.
   Qantas paid for him to stay the night at the Airport Hilton Hotel
before putting him on a plane home _ as a first-class passenger.

   A man who confessed earlier this year to
raping a woman nearly 18 years ago has been sentenced to three years
probation and ordered to pay the victim $10,000.
   Phillip Carlock of Redmond, Wash., held hands with his wife
Thursday when Circuit Court Judge Patrick Conlin sentenced him.
Carlock also is required to seek psychiatric counseling.
   Ann Arbor police said Carlock, a computer software specialist,
confessed to the rape in April, telling authorities he was
undergoing therapy and wanted to clear his conscience.
   Conlin said the 39-year-old victim, who now lives in Florida,
told Washtenaw County probation officials that Carlock should not
have to go to jail, but should be required to continue therapy.
   ``Mr. Carlock came forward with absolutely no compelling reason
to do so other than the very serious remorse that he felt for what
he had done,'' said his lawyer, Marjory Cohen.

   The 10 men who flew the two Arizona-based planes
fired on over Mauritania were a close-knit group dedicated to
ridding western Africa of locusts, their families said.
   One of the planes was shot down Thursday and officials said all
five people aboard were killed. A second DC-7 was damaged in the
anti-aircraft missile attack but was able to land at a remote
airstrip in Morocco. No injuries were reported among those aboard.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   A co-owner of the downed DC-7 identified those who were killed
as: Joel Blackmer, 46; his son, Frank Kennedy, 21, of Phoenix;
Bernard Rossini, 49, of Tempe, Ariz.; Frank Hederman, 47, of Cody,
Wyo.; and Wes Wilson, of Hershey, Neb.
   Sergio Tomassoni, 64, a co-owner of T & G Aviation in Chandler,
Ariz., said in a telephone interview from Agadir, Morocco, that he
was aboard the other T & G Aviation DC-7.
   ``We were just flying along at about 11,000 feet when, all of a
sudden, the first airplane was hit,'' Tomassoni said. ``We saw the
smoke and a big ball of fire. One of the engines was in flames. The
plane started losing altitude, and then the right wing blew off. I
knew they were in trouble, but we had problems of our own.''
   The planes were under contract to the U.S. Agency for
International Development to spray locust swarms in Senegal, he
said. They were fired on near where Marxist rebels have been
fighting Morocco for an independent Western Sahara.
   ``All my dad wanted to do was take some of his skills to help
other people,'' said Kara Rossini, 22, of St. Paul, Rossini's
daughter.
   ``He was the kind of guy who would look at the little Ethiopian
kids with the big bellies and cry. He ends up getting shot by a
bunch of creeps who probably are going to get some of the food from
this effort,'' she said.
   The 10 men who made up the crews were friends who loved to spend
time talking shop about airplanes and aviation, Tomassoni said.
   Tomassoni's wife, Lydia, of Chandler, said her husband survived
another tragedy in 1986 on another pesticide-spraying mission in
Senegal.
   His plane, another DC-7, developed engine trouble and crashed
into the Atlantic Ocean, she said. Three others died, but Tomassoni
survived.
   ``Nothing bothers those idiots,'' Mrs. Tomassoni said. ``They're
all ex-servicemen. That's their life.''

said company spokesman Shin Kagawa.
   Two workers were seriously injured and one sustained only minor

   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said
Friday he favors closer ties with Tunisia in a five-nation Arab
alliance known as the Maghreb.
   ``Our unity should not necessarily be subjected to uniformity of
political systems,'' said Gadhafi, who began a three-day visit
Thursday.
   ``It is a matter of a constitutional unity in the Maghreb
framework, within which we see a bilateral integration,'' he said in
a speech to the Tunisian Parliament.
   Other countries making up the Maghreb are Algeria, Morocco and
Mauritania.
   Thursday night, Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali told
Gadhafi the two countries must ``reconcile the possible and the
desirable'' to strengthen the alliance ``as a prelude to global Arab
unity.''
   Tunisia and Libya re-established diplomatic relations a year ago
after a two-year break, caused by Gadhafi's decision to deport
32,000 Tunisian workers.

<HEAD>For Reagan, Questions About the Same, But Answers Different</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As President Reagan held what is likely to be
his last White House news conference, many of the reporters'
questions sounded hauntingly like those at his first one, but many
of the answers were different.
   The first question when Reagan met reporters on Jan. 29, 1981,
was about relations with Iran in the aftermath of the long captivity
of American hostages that had ended on the day of his inaugration
nine days before.
   He said then, ``I don't know whether reconciliation would be
possible with the present government, or absence of a government, in
Iran.''
   One of the last questions Thursday night was about relations with
Iran as American hostages continue to be held by radical Moslem
forces in Lebanon with whom the Iranians are believed to have
influence.
   The president said, ``Anytime that they are ready to come forward
on an open basis, we would be ready to talk to them.''
   The contrast between the two answers was one mark among many of
the changes that nearly eight years in office have wrought on Reagan.
   There is no fixed timetable for presidential news conferences, so
this does not have to be the last before Reagan leaves office on
Jan. 20. In fact, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to
rule out the possibility of another.
   The first lady, however, beseeched reporters on Tuesday, ``Be
nice. It's his last one.''
   For his own part, Reagan opened the meeting with reporters by
cracking, ``We've got to stop meeting like this.'' And when a
reporter prefaced a question by saying that the session would be the
president's last, Reagan did not demur.
   In any event, many of the questions and answers had a distinct
tone of summing up.
   With Reagan fresh off his fifth meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, it was inevitable that someone would remind
him of his most famous words at the January 1981 session.
   Reagan told reporters then, ``I know of no leader of the Soviet
Union since the revolution, and including the present leadership,
that has not more than once repeated ... their determination that
their goal must be the promotion of world revolution.''
   Furthermore, he said, the Soviet leaders ``have openly and
publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will
further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right
to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat, in order to attain that.''
   Thursday night, Reagan said, ``That was four leaders back before
this one. I think there have been some changes.''
   Asked directly whether he trusted Gorbachev, the president said,
``He hasn't shown me any reason yet why I shouldn't.''
   Reagan's ``to lie, to cheat'' line was one of many memorable
phrases to come from his news conferences, an institution that took
on an increasingly theatrical tone during the former actor's
administration.
   It was at a news conference on Feb. 21, 1985, that he said he was
not advocating the overthrow of the Nicaraguan government, or at any
rate ``not if the present government would turn around and say, `all
right,' if they'd say `uncle.'''
   It was at a news conference on April 9, 1986, that he
characterized Libya's Moammar Gadhafi as ``this mad dog of the
Middle East.''
   And it was at a news conference on June 11, 1987, in Venice,
Italy, that he said he thought the dollar could decline further
``within reason,'' at a time when his administration was trying to
keep it from sliding at all.
   The first Reagan White House news conference, like most in the
early days of his administration, was held in a workmanlike
auditorium in the Old Executive Office Building, next door to the
White House.
   In mid-1982, the sessions were moved to the more ornate if less
comfortable East Room on the glittering state floor of the executive
residence.
   A further refinement was instituted in 1984. Instead of
addressing reporters with his back to the east wall of the room,
Reagan switched to the west side, giving him a chance to make an
entrance down a hallway visible through an open door.
   ``Our people just got tired of seeing me in the same set,'' he
cracked at the time.
   Thursday night, the entrance was even more dramatic than usual.
Because of Christmas decorating at the White House, Reagan could not
pop out of the Blue Room as he usually does, but had to enter the
hall from the Red Room, which is farther away.
   Despite the changes in trappings, however, it was the flow of the
news that set the tone of the news conferences _ from turmoil in
Central America and Lebanon to the Iran-Contra arms and money
scandal and the battles over the budget deficit.
   At that first news conference, there were seven questions about
relations with Iran. Thursday night there was one.
   In January 1981 there was one question about relations with the
Soviet Union. Thursday night there were five.
   The news conference also showed there is one thing reporters have
learned in eight years of trying to pin Reagan down to specifics.
   Nearly every reporter Thursday night took advantage of the
opportunity to ask a follow-up question.
   At the first conference in 1981, none of them did.

   Air and water pollution has given Shanghai the
highest death rate from cancer in China, a researcher said Friday.
   The annual cancer mortality rate in Shanghai is more than 2 per
thousand males and 1.4 per thousand females, comparable London and
Los Angeles, said Gao Yutang of the Shanghai Tumor Research
Institute.
   The official People's Daily, which on Friday published the
findings of the Tumor Research Institute, said the death rate from
cancer in Shanghai rose more than 230 percent in the past 25 years.
   It blamed pollution for 80 percent of the deaths in the east
coast industrial city and cited a lack of zoning restrictions,
permitting construction of air-polluting factories in residential
areas.
   Gao said heavy smoking is also to blame. About 300 million of
China's 1.08 billion people smoke.
   The government says cancer is the leading cause of death among
urban males and the No. 3 cause among urban women.

   Rescuers used rubber rafts to ferry the 14 youths, aged 11 to 18,
and five adult guides to safety Thursday night.
   The group entered Hoelloch, one of Europe's largest systems of

cut off when heavy rain flooded part of the cave system.
   The spelunkers, well-equipped with food and camping equipment,
retreated to a dry spot about 2,000 feet underground.
   Expedition leader Max Gubser said no one panicked and that that
all members were unhurt after the ordeal.

<TEXT>
   Two brothers led a gang that sold $100
million in cocaine a year and used violence to control the streets
and drive off competing dealers, prosecutors said.
   Robert ``Dread'' Smith, 32, a Jamaican-born alien, was among 23
people named in a 72-count federal indictment unsealed Thursday. If
convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a
$108 million fine.
   Smith has been in custody since August on charges that he killed
one man and wounded another in a 1986 street shooting. His trial on
those charges is set for January.
   Smith, his brother, Everton, 29, and other members of the gang
routinely used violence to maintain control over those who sold the
drugs, including crack, and to keep them from reporting their
activities to police, said U.S. Attorney Michael Baylson.
   The defendants, 16 of whom were in custody this morning, were
charged with violating federal drug, racketeering and firearms laws.
   Edward Leary, in charge of the FBI office here, said the acts the
defendants allegedly committed ``are tantamount to those of an urban
terrorist group which has violently sought to satisfy its own greed
by preying upon those addicted to illegal narcotics.''
   ``They had little or no regard for anyone who stood in their
way,'' Leary said. ``They have oppressed children into doing their
bidding and have threatened the fabric of life in this community.''
   Smith's gang allegedly handled an annual average of 2,000 pounds
of cocaine, plus an unknown quantity of marijuana, said Samuel
Billbrough, who heads the Philadelphia office of the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration. A pound of cocaine sells for about
$11,000 wholesale, and the retail price is roughly five times that,
making the gross sales more than $100 million yearly, Billbrough
said.
   All the defendants are charged with conspiracy to manufacture
cocaine base, commonly called crack, and to distribute cocaine,
crack and marijuana.
   The Smiths and two others also are charged with engaging in a
continuing criminal enterprise in violation of the federal ``drug
kingpin'' law, which carries a maximum life sentence.

   The American Red Cross today collected money,
antibiotics and supplies to help victims of the Armenian earthquake
as the Soviet Embassy said it has been overwhelmed with donations
and had set up a bank account for those wishing to help.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Terry Gautier said her organization is
making arrangements with major pharmaceutical firms to supply
antibiotics for shipment to the scene of the disaster.
   In addition, the Red Cross is collecting money to be used in
aiding the quake victims, with Armenian church and ethnic groups in
this country being particularly helpful, she said.
   U.S. officials are also collecting ``blood packs'' for shipment
to the Soviet Union, she said.
   Blood packs are the materials used to collect blood from donors
and separate it into various components, she explained. While the
Soviet Union has sufficient volunteers donating blood, it needs the
equipment to collect it for use in the quake-damaged area.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the U.S.
government stood ready to do whatever it can to help facilitate the
delivery of assistance and materials collected through private means.
   The American Red Cross has activated a toll-free number for
people to call to offer assistance. The number is 1-800-453-9000.
Americans can also make donations to local Red Cross chapters,
marked for the Soviet Armenian Earthquake Relief, or through various
Armenian groups.
   At the Soviet Embassy, meanwhile, spokesman Igor Bulay said:
   ``The phones are ringing constantly. ... There is a stream of
donations. People are walking up to the doors of the embassy with
checks and money orders. Checks are beginning to come in the mail.''
   Bulay said the embassy has opened an account at the Dupont Circle
Branch of the Riggs National Bank, 1913 Massachusetts Ave. NW,
Washington, D.C., 20036.
   The name of the account is ``Relief'' and the account number is
04-08-572-564. Bulay said that as money is received it will be sent
immediately to Armenia and used in the relief efforts.

   Relief planes from around the world rushed
emergency supplies into Armenia today to help victims of an
earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people and left hundreds
of thousands homeless.
   A spokesman for Yerevan's Zvarnots airport said planes arrived
today from France, Belgium and Bulgaria and many more were expected.
It was the first time disaster aid had reached the Soviet Union on
such a scale.
   Soviet officials released no death toll two days after
Wednesday's quake, but the Soviet ambassador in Britain, Leonid
Zamyatin, said today that about 80,000 people died in the southern
republic.
   Speaking briefly in English to a delegation of Armenians at the
Soviet Embassy in London, he said: ``Our estimate is, but it's not
an exact figure, that we have about 80,000 people who lost life in
Armenia.''
   He also said 2.5 million lost their homes, but that figure could
not be verified and the republic only has a population of 3.3
million. A Tass news agency report said 400,000 people were homeless.
   Tass said ``the earthquake killed tens of thousands of people.''
Radio Moscow said: ``It is believed that scores of thousands of
people have died.''
   Previous statements had put the death toll in the thousands, but
sources have provided unofficial estimates of as many as 50,000 dead.
   A scientist predicted more tremors would occur. Workers scrambled
to find survivors buried in the rubble.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev returned home to direct the
growing relief efforts, which brought emergency food, medics,
medical supplies and search equipment to the devastated region.
   Gorbachev, who cut short a trip to the United States and canceled
plans to visit Cuba and Britain, arrived in Moscow before dawn, Tass
said. He was expected to travel to Armenia, but officials refused to
exactly when.
   Tass reported a Swiss rescue team and 20 search dogs flew to
Armenia with eight tons of rescue supplies. Swedish officials
announced $1 million in rescue assistance, and Finland sent
shipments of blood plasma.
   President Reagan offered humanitarian aid, Cuban President Fidel
Castro pledged to send construction workers, and Britain, France and
Italy also dispatched rescue teams.
   Leon Azruyan, an editor at the official Armenpress news agency in
the Armenian capital, Yerevan, said he saw dozens of villages
``totally destroyed.'' In Spitak, a city of 16,000 near Leninakan,
``99 percent of the population is gone,'' he said.
   ``Helpless sobbing people are climbing on the wreckage of an
apartment house, from which can be heard heart-rending cries for
help,'' the Communist Party daily Pravda wrote from Leninakan, a
heavily battered city near the quake's epicenter.
   U.S. scientists said the quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   ``We expect more tremors to take place soon in the area of the
earthquake that shook the trans-Caucasian region on Dec. 7,'' said
Nikolai Shebalin, a spokesman for the Soviet Institute of Physics of
the Earth.
   Tass quoted him as saying the tremors ``should be less powerful''
than the quake, which also rocked portions of the republics of
Azerbaijan and Georgia.
   Official Soviet media covered the disaster with unprecedented
scope and speed.
   In an interview Thursday on Soviet television, Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov appealed for aid to the area. He said rescue workers needed
cranes and other heavy equipment to remove debris and look for
survivors.
   TV reports said two-thirds of Leninakan, a city of 290,000 on the
Turkish border, were destroyed.
   Spitak ``was practically erased from the face of the Earth,''
said one television correspondent.
   Tass said half the buildings in Kirovakan, a city of 150,000, had
crumbled.
   It said the injured and those left homeless were being housed in
tents, military barracks, officers' houses and clubs, garrisons and
dining rooms.
   Alexei Gartinsky, a senior official of the Soviet Red Cross, told
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' today that antibiotics, disposable
syringes and blood supplies are needed. However, he said his
organization has not issued an international appeal.
   Albert Khachatryan, a department head of the Armenia Health
Ministry, said by telephone that 4,700 injured people, including 800
children, were in Yerevan's hospitals.
   ``We have set up special surgical and trauma units in various
hospitals and more than 300 specialists from other cities and other
republics have arrived to help out,'' he said.
   Today and Saturday were declared days of mourning in Armenia.
   A special meeting of representatives of all 15 Soviet republics
was called in Yerevan to discuss disaster relief.

   Jeanie Austin, chairwoman of the Republican
Party in Florida, has been tapped to become the GOP national
co-chairman, officials announced Friday.
   Ms. Austin will be formally elected at a Republican National
Committee meeting next month at which Lee Atwater's designation as
party chairman also will be ratified. Atwater served as campaign
manager for President-elect Bush.
   Ms. Austin has been active in Florida politics since 1970. A
retired American Telephone & Telegraph executive, she has held a
variety of party posts in her home state, including four years as
chairwoman.
   ``Great challenges confront us in the future but also great
opportunities,'' Ms. Austin said. ``I am excited to be a part of the
movement that I believe can reposition our party as the majority
party in the future.''
   Atwater praised Ms. Austin as a ``political pro who delivers
results.''

   Solididarity leader Lech Walesa today made his first
foreign trip since Poland's martial-law crackdown seven years ago
and told reporters it was time to leave the Stalinist system behind.
   ``After seven years, here I am at the dawn of something new,''
said a smiling Walesa after his arrival at Charles de Gaulle airport.
   Walesa, who was permitted to accept the invitation of President
Francois Mitterrand to join observances of the 40th anniversary of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, said he was looking
forward to meeting Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov, another Nobel
Peace Prize laureate invited by Mitterrand to Saturday's ceremonies.
   ``We both still feel, he and I, the breath of Stalin at our
backs,'' Walesa said, speaking Polish through an interpreter. ``The
Stalin era is over. Now I am waiting for the return to pluralism and
the restoration of rights.''
   Before leaving Warsaw, Walesa told reporters, ``There are several
elements which cause hope that everything's going to be better.''
   But he said problems remained, such the government's monopoly on
trade unions and its handling of social, political and economic
problems.
   ``That is still the breath of Stalin. It was not communism, it
was him. And we have to end it ... by way of evolution and not
revolution.''
   ``I'd like to reach an agreement at last on pluralism and to
finish the Stalinist system for good,'' he said.
   Walesa also was to confer with French trade unionists, the mayor
of Paris and Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, leader of the French
Roman Catholic Church, before returning Monday.
   Walesa, bundled in a thick coat and sporting a front-billed fur
cap, received cheers of ``Bravo Lech!'' when he arrived at Warsaw's
central train station from Gdansk earlier in the day.
   Crowds also gathered around him and historian Bronislaw Geremek
at the airport, with parents holding up children for a better view.
   Geremek, a senior Solidarity adviser, was accompanying Walesa on
the trip.
   In a departure from past practice, the state-controlled media
treated Walesa as a public figure instead of as a private citizen.
   His departure for Paris was listed by the official PAP news
agency as one of its top stories of the day.
   It was the first time since the imposition of martial law in
Poland in December 1981 that Walesa received permission to travel
abroad.
   The issuance of a passport to him Monday coincided with
increasingly positive treatment of Walesa in the official press
since he appeared in a nationwide television debate Nov. 30.
   Walesa was viewed by supporters as having handily won the debate
with official unions' chief Alfred Miodowicz, and the
non-confrontational tone of his remarks drew praise even from
normally hostile government officials.
   The Solidarity leader last left Poland in October 1981, also to
visit France.
   Walesa has led Solidarity since the inception of the first
independent trade union in the Soviet bloc in August 1980.
   Walesa had insisted Geremek, a French medieval scholar who speaks
French fluently, accompany him. Also making the trip with Walesa was
Andrzej Wielowieyski, vice president of the Warsaw Club of Catholic
Intelligentsia.

<TEXT>
   On horseback and ox-drawn wagons,
Afrikaners paraded into the city Friday to celebrate the 150th
anniversary of the white pioneers' trek into the country's heartland.
   The march, held seven days before the official anniversary, was
organized by right-wing white groups. They object to the upcoming
government-backed ceremony, which has been billed as open to all
races.
   Nearly 1,000 whites, dressed in 19th century pioneer outfits,
arrived in downtown Pretoria to mark the Great Trek, the 1838
journey by Afrikaners away from the British-ruled Cape Colony into
the country's uncharted interior.
   Altogether about 3,000 people attended the parade, with wagons
arriving from several locations across the country.
   The Great Trek is the most momentous event in Afrikaner history.
Stories about hardships on the journey and battles with African
tribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the Dutch-descended
Afrikaners, who dominate the government.
   ``Today we remember how our ancestors built this country into a
civilized area where it's safe for whites to live,'' said Dann
Combrink, 62.
   Combrink, wearing a leather vest and wide-brimmed hat, was
accompanied by his wife in a period costume that included a bonnet
and a full-length lavender and white dress with lace trim.
   ``This a day Afrikaners should be together,'' said Combrink.
   Organizers said blacks were not welcome at Friday's ceremony or
at an evening gathering at the Voortrekker Monument, a huge granite
structure on a hill overlooking the capital.
   ``The Great Trek marked the coming of our oppression, the
stripping of our rights,'' said a 45-year-old black man who asked to
be identified only as George. ``When I see this, I am very angry,
very bitter.''
   The 100th anniversary commemoration, held in 1938, is regarded as
the catalyst that united the Afrikaners and gave impetus to their
political organizations. Ten years later, the Afrikaner-dominated
National Party came to power and began codifying their apartheid
policies of racial segregation.
   But the two separate trek celebrations illustrate the fracture
between right-wing Afrikaners, who oppose all concessions to the
country's black majority, and President's P.W. Botha's National
Party, which calls for gradual race reforms and limited
power-sharing.
   Friday's ceremony was organized by the Afrikaner Peoples' Guard,
a right-wing cultural group. The contingent that received the
loudest applause was from the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, led by the charismatic Eugene TerreBlanche.
   Most members of TerreBlanche's group opted not for the 19th
century attire of their ancestors, but wore khaki outfits with
swastika-like emblems on the shoulders.
   TerreBlanche and his followers received sustained cheers as they
rode around Church Square in the city center, in front of the
courthouse where five black anti-apartheid leaders were sentenced to
prison Thursday on treason and terrorism convictions following a
controversial trial.
   The government-sponsored trek left Cape Town on Aug. 27 for the
870-mile trip to Pretoria. Despite the government's announced
intention of opening the celebrations to all races, few non-whites
have participated.
   The government functions will dominate the next week leading up
to the Day of the Vow, a national holiday, on Dec. 16.
   On that day in 1838, the Afrikaners vowed to make the date
forever holy if they defeated a hostile Zulu tribe. They did so in
the Battle of Blood River, and the day remains the most revered in
Afrikaner history.

   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
said Friday he was stunned by Greece's decision this week to free a
suspected Palestinian terrorist whose extradition was long sought by
Italy.
   ``The release of this terrorist is shocking,'' Shultz said of
Abdel Osama Al-Zomar, who is wanted in Italy for involvement in a
1982 attack against a Rome synagogue that killed a 2-year-old boy
and injured 34 people.
   ``We cannot mince words or in any way shirk the actions we have
to take'' to combat international terrorism, Shultz said. ``This
release is bad ... and I am shocked by it. When a known terrorist
like this is released, it's shocking.''
   He spoke after a two-day meeting of the NATO foreign ministers.
   Al-Zomar, 27, was arrested when he arrived in Greece in 1982 and
served 20 months in a Greek jail for arms smuggling. His extradition
was approved by the Greek Supreme Court in 1984 but never carried
out. Al-Zomar was sentenced to another 20 months in 1987 for having
a knife in his jail cell.
   On Tuesday, Greece put Al-Zomar on a plane to Libya. Justice
Minister Vassilis Rotis said Greece did not extradite him ``because
Al-Zomar was acting in the struggle for the ... independence of his
country,'' referring to the Palestinian fight for a homeland in
Israeli-occupied territory.
   Both Greek and other Western intelligence officials believe
Al-Zomar belongs to the terrorist group of Abu Nidal.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and its 15 Western
allies decided Friday to seize on an ``unprecedented opportunity''
for change in the Soviet Union by pursuing cooperative political
solutions to Europe's problems.
   But Secretary of State George P. Shultz, in his NATO swan song
after more than 30 meetings with the allies over 6{ years, cautioned
against over-reaction to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's decision
to withdraw 50,000 troops from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and
Hungary.
   ``Being encouraged doesn't mean that you just go bananas and
forget about what got you here and so you want to keep doing the
things that are constructive,'' Shultz said in a final appeal for
unity within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   He stressed that even with the Soviet cutbacks, to be carried out
over two years, the Warsaw Pact still would retain an enormous
advantage in battle tanks, artillery and other armaments.
   ``They will be significant and make a difference,'' Shultz said.
``But they leave a situation still very assymetrical. We shouldn't
forget that.''
   For instance, Shultz said, reading from data compiled by NATO on
conventional forces, the Warsaw Pact's edge in divisions would be
reduced to 2.91-1 from 2.99-1, in tanks to 2.18-1 from 2.76-1, and
in artillery to 1.74-1 from 2.30 to 1.
   In a similar vein, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner told
reporters: ``We cannot base our security on the good or bad
intentions or the personality of the Soviet leaders.''
   The former West German defense minister added: ``You know that we
look upon Mr. Gorbachev with sympathy and encourage his reform
efforts while they lead to more human rights and more responsible
conduct in foreign affairs and a reduction in military capability.''
   But, Woerner said, NATO must keep its defenses strong, and
modernize weapons even while negotiating cutbacks with the Warsaw
Pact in talks expected to open next month in Vienna.
   As a group, the foreign ministers pledged: ``We will continue to
seize every opportunity to cooperate in the search for political
solutions to East-West differences.''
   However, they also urged ``tangible and lasting changes'' from
the Soviet Union to help solve the problems dividing East and West.
   Soviet forces stationed in Europe, which NATO estimated at 2.2
million, ``still exceed any reasonable defense need,'' and Moscow
and its allies ``still have to meet fully their obligations on human
rights.''
   The ministers on Thursday announced the broad outline of the
position NATO will take in the Conventional Stability Talks with the
Warsaw Pact once a 35-nation human rights conference in Vienna is
concluded.
   In a separate statement, NATO reaffirmed that trade with the
Soviet Union and its allies should be based on ``commercially sound
terms and mutual advantage.''
   The statement rejected any notion of providing ``preferential
treatment'' to the Soviets, who are eager for Western technology to
help carry out Gorbachev's perestroika program of reconstructing the
Soviet economy.
   The Western ministers said they wanted to avoid ``contributing
further to Soviet military capabilities'' by extending concessions.
   In the arms area, Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek told
reporters that after Gorbachev's speech Wednesday to the U.N.
General Assembly in New York ``the climate for the conventional
negotations has considerably improved. Much needs to happen but
things are looking up.''

   A brush fire fanned by fierce Santa Ana winds
raced through a neighborhood of expensive homes early today, burning
at least 20 homes and forcing evacuations of up to 5,000 people.
   It was the second day wind reached speeds above 60 mph. On
Thursday, fires destroyed at least 22 homes and cut power to half a
million people.
   Today's brush fire was in the Porter Ranch district, 25 miles
northwest of downtown, where many homes have flammable wooden shake
shingle roofs, authorities said.
   Ten homes were destroyed and 10 were damaged as the fire spread
through canyons in the Santa Susana Mountains and into foothill
neighborhoods, said Fire Department spokesman Gary Svider. No
injuries were reported.
   ``One of the major problems up here is that we have a lot of wood
shingle roofs and they go up like matchsticks,'' said Battalion
Chief Dean Cathey.
   Cause of the blaze, which blackened at least 1,800 acres, was not
immediately known.
   Wind gusted to 60 mph, and the National Weather Service said the
relative humidity was 15 percent, compared to a normal 60 percent in
the early morning.
   Police began evacuating a residential area of four to six square
miles after the fire broke out about 5:45 a.m., said police Sgt.
Doug Boka. He said thousands of people would be forced from their
homes near the northern foothills of the San Fernando Valley.
   Porter Ranch residents were awakened by choking smoke and an
orange glow in the sky.
   ``It was just like raining fire,'' said Tim Dinsmore, 16, who
helped his father wet down the family's home before they had to flee
several blocks away. ``As I was spraying water the neighbors' houses
started to burn; that's when I got scared.'' The Dinsmores' home
survived the onslaught.
   ``Thousands of embers were coming down on us as we left,'' said
Hank Piorek, who fled the neighborhood with his family of four.
   At least three schools in the area were closed and some sections
of boulevard and freeway access ramps were closed because of smoke.
   The hot, dry ``devil winds'' from the desert gusted to 69 mph
Thursday, causing damage estimated at $10 million but no serious
injuries, although some residents had to dash through flames to
safety, officials said.
   ``We saw sparks, showers of sparks, like rain,'' said Ruben
Cabadas, 18, recounting his family's flight from their Baldwin Park
home on Thursday.
   Hardest hit were the Los Angeles suburbs of Baldwin Park and La
Verne, where fires blamed on wind-downed power lines destroyed at
least 22 homes and damaged 12 others and five businesses.
   The winds toppled at least a dozen tractor-trailers and a motor
home on freeways obscured by blowing dirt and sand.
   About 500,000 people were without power at various times. By
nightfall Thursday, 30,800 remained in the dark in Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, utility officials
said.
   Electricity was out in the La Canada-Flintridge School District,
where schools were closed today.
   The Santa Ana winds blow through the deserts on their way to
Southern California at this time of year, picking up both speed and
warmth and increasing the fire danger in areas left dry by lack of
rain.
   The forecast held little relief. The high-pressure system causing
the turbulence, in combination with a low-pressure system off Baja
California, appeared to be stuck over southern Idaho, the National
Weather Service said.
   ``I can see these winds continuing, although not as strong as
today, into the early part of next week,'' weather service
meteorologist Mark McKinley said Thursday.
   Fourteen homes were destroyed in Baldwin Park 20 miles northeast
of downtown Los Angeles and five were damaged along with five
commercial buildings when 75 mph gusts snapped power lines, igniting
a fire at Allan Paper Co., fire officials said. Damage was estimated
at $4.5 million.
   In La Verne and neighboring unincorporated parts of Claremont,
eight homes were devastated and seven damaged in wind-driven fires.
Damage was estimated at $5 million.
   ``We lost everything _ the house, the cars,'' said Dan Hanlon,
49, of La Verne, who fled with his wife. ``We were lucky to get out.
We had to drive through flames.''
   An artificial Christmas tree wrapped in colored lights and tinsel
lay on the driveway of Roy and Elinor Livingston's home, the only
thing salvaged from the ruins.
   Awakened by a neighbor, the couple found a row of palm trees and
a nearby home ablaze, and battled fires on their roof until they
were overwhelmed.
   ``It was just like the air was full of these giant sparks,'' said
Mrs. Livingston, 56.
   In the San Fernando Valley community of Chatsworth, six men were
arrested for investigation of arson as firefighters doused a
five-acre brushfire, a ridge into Glendale, Wells said.
   The powerful winds caused turbulence that jolted a Piedmont
Airlines jet approaching Los Angeles International Airport, slightly
injuring two flight attendants and four passengers.
   Damage was estimated at $40,000 to five floats being built for
Pasadena's Tournament of Roses Parade. The floats' chicken-wire
skeletons were crushed when a giant tent housing them in Azusa
collapsed. They were expected to be rebuilt by the Jan. 2 event.
   In La Jolla to the south, a wind-fanned brush fire burned about
60 acres in a steep coastal canyon and threatened the Scripps Clinic
hospital and other businesses before about 100 area firefighters
contained it, said San Diego fire spokesman Larry Stewart.
   The California Highway Patrol warned Southern California
motorists to exercise caution _ particularly those with campers,
trailers and other high-profile vehicles vulnerable to wind.

   Suspected Sikh militants ambushed a car
carrying one of the five high priests of their religion and shot him
to death Friday in Punjab state, a news agency reported.
   Balbir Singh was killed in the district of Ropar, north of the
state capital, Chandigarh, the United News of India reported. His
driver and bodyguard were injured, UNI said.
   The five priests had earlier this week readmitted former Punjab
chief minister Surjit Singh Barnala into the Sikh community after
expelling him last year for sending police into the Golden Temple.
   The temple is the holiest Sikh shrine and the priests had said at
the time that Barnala had commited sacrilege.
   Newspapers said Barnala's re-entry into the community was opposed
by Sikh militants.
   Sikh militants have been fighting for an independent homeland in
Punjab since 1982. They have been blamed for at least 2,350 killings
in the state this year.
   Many of the victims have been Sikh moderates opposed to the
separatist campaign. The militants have labeled the moderates as
traitors.

   As president, George Bush should declare
children his top priority and commit the country to investing
whatever it takes to ease problems ranging from poverty to abuse, a
children's advocacy group said Friday.
   David Liederman, executive director of the Child Welfare League
of America, said his group is seeking a commitment similar to
President Kennedy's pledge to put a man on the moon. Money for the
space program began flowing immediately, he said.
   ``We understand that there's a (budget) deficit,'' Liederman
said, ``but in the history of the United States, any important
initiative that a president called for, we somehow found the money.''
   The league, a network of more than 500 public and private social
service agencies, is urging Bush to keep campaign promises to expand
Head Start; institute child care tax credits; expand medical
coverage of the poor; and raise spending for homeless aid, school
lunches, immunization programs and nutrition supplements for
pregnant women and infants.
   Liederman said his group also is seeking enactment of at least
some portions of last year's unsuccessful Act for Better Child Care
in order to bolster the supply of day care. ``If you don't have
enough day care, a child care tax credit doesn't work,'' he said.
   The league also is urging Bush to support, and Congress to pass,
comprehensive programs for pregnant adolescents, children and youth
with AIDS, families with no health insurance and unemployed youth,
as well as a higher minimum wage, mandated family leave in the
private sector and expanded supplies of affordable housing.
   Liederman said a good start toward the league's goals might
involve $5 billion in new spending in 1989. ``We are totally
realistic. We're saying let's start,'' he said.
   Asked where that money would come from, Liederman replied, ``The
same place the money comes from for the stealth bomber, for the B-1
bomber, for the Export-Import Bank ... the same place the money
comes from to fund everything that we think is important.''
   Liederman said the league has delivered to Bush a copy of its
plan, called ``The First 100 Days: A Children's Initiative,'' and
has requested a meeting with him.
   ``We like his promises,'' he said. ``We're optimistic. We're
taking President-elect Bush at his word.''

<HEAD>China Expresses Support For Human Rights But Questions Remain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China on Friday honored the 40th anniversary of
the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, although questions
remain about this nation's commitment to such concepts.
   Fei Xiaotong, a well-known sociologist, was quoted by the
official Xinhua News Agency as saying that China actively supports
the development of human rights.
   Fei, speaking at a forum to commemorate the U.N. declaration,
said China's constitution guarantees individual rights, including
freedom of religion and equality before the law.
   He noted, however, that the struggle for human rights should
concentrate not on individual freedoms but on fighting colonialism,
racism and foreign invasion.
   The report was the latest in a series of articles in the official
press stressing China's position that collective rights are more
important than individual liberties.
   A Xinhua report this week said China believes that civil
liberties, rights of minorities and women belong to the ``internal
affairs'' of a country and advised other countries not to meddle in
those questions.
   An article in the Nov. 28 issue of Beijing Review, an official
weekly, soft-pedaled discussion of individual liberties. Human
rights, it said, were a key part in the efforts of Third World
countries to ``establish a new economic order.''
   By pushing such a policy, China can justify both its criticism of
apartheid in South Africa and its rejection of accusations about its
policies in Tibet or its one-party state.
   ``It is no good to force one country's standards on another,''
Friday's Xinhua report said. ``Interference in a country's internal
affairs on the pretext of human rights should be strictly
forbidden.''
   Western human rights groups have persisted in criticizing China's
record.
   In February, the Washington-based group Asia Watch said Chinese
authorities tortured Tibetan activists seeking independence from
China and performed forced abortions on members of minority groups.
   Pro-independence Tibetans have rioted twice in the past two
years, leaving dozens dead in Lhasa, the region's capital.
   The Asia Watch report quoted one Tibetan as saying, ``if one
speaks forcefully, if one gives an account of Tibet as being
independent, they apply cattle prods.''
   Earlier this year, the U.S. Congress also criticized China for
its actions in Tibet.
   An Amnesty International report in April accused China of denying
prisoners access to lawyers or their families. In earlier years, the
London-based group has called for the release of Wei Jingsheng,
China's most prominent dissident, who as a leading member of the
``Democracy Movement'' was jailed in 1979.
   Last week, one of Wei's former associates, Ren Wanding, who spent
four years in jail for his views, renewed his call for free
elections in China.
   Ren, who was freed in 1983, also appealed to the United Nations
to intercede on behalf of his fellow dissidents, like Wei, still
imprisoned.
   The U.N. Declaration on Human Rights was passed in 1948 and
guarantees political, economic and cultural rights as well as the
right of self-determination, sovereignty and territorial
independence.
   China signed the declaration in 1971 when it joined the United
Nations. This year marked the first time China has honored the
document.

   The Plain English Campaign on Friday bestowed eight
Golden Bull Awards for what it regarded as particularly
undistinguished examples of doubletalk and obfuscation.
   ``This year has been a record year for gobbledygook. We could
have given out hundreds of bulls without any problem,'' said
Chrissie Maher, who helped start the campaign nine years ago.
   She cited the latest regulations for claiming state public
assistance for housing, saying they ``lengthened many forms by over
a half, yet the government minister who introduced them claimed they
would simplify the system. The truth is that the forms are now so
long they deter people from claiming.''
   One of the 6-inch-high Golden Bulls went to Sooner Snacks Ltd.
for a letter to a customer who complained that her potato chips were
purple.
   ``Potato varieties with pigmented skins owe their color to
anthocyanins dissolved in the cell sap of the periderm and cells of
the peripheral cortex,'' the letter said.
   When a chip is discolored, the letter added, ``It is difficult to
say whether this is due to a process of active migration of the
anthocyanin from the periderm and cortex or to primary protection
within the flesh of the tuber.''
   The Department of Health and Social Security was cited for its
response to a widow's inquiry about her pension.
   It explained that ``basic retirement pension based wholly or
partially upon the contributions of her late husband cannot be paid
in full to a widow who is getting such a benefit. She can only be
paid the balance of basic retirement pension and increase for
putting off retirement which is left after taking off her war
widow's pension or, the part of the basic retirement pension which
is based purely on her own contributions, plus any increase for
putting off her retirement, whichever is the more favorable.''
   Lloyds Bank won a Bull for a counter indemnity form which said:
   ``I-we jointly and severally undertake in the event of any claim
being made upon you thereunder, or under any increase or decrease
thereof or extension or renewal thereof (whether for the same or for
a greater or less amount), which you may hereafter make or agree to
at my-our request, and in the event of the validity of such claim
being disputed by me-us, from time to time ...'' and so on for more
than 100 words before reaching the end of the sentence.

<HEAD>Engineers Say Rockets Worked Properly on September Shuttle Flight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gas leaked past a caulked seal in the nozzle of
a rocket booster used to launch space shuttle Discovery in
September, but a NASA official said Friday that this was anticipated
by the design and is ``a non-problem.''
   Royce Mitchell, manager of the booster program at the Marshall
Space Flight Center, said in a telephone interview that an
examination of the disassembled Discovery solid-fuel rockets showed
the engines worked ``as expected'' and that the gas leakage has been
seen in testing and is considered a normal event.
   ``We're very happy with these motors,'' Mitchell said.
   Mitchell said engineers examining the disassembled rocket parts
found that gas seeped between panels of ablative material in the
nozzle of one of the two boosters.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration official said
the nozzles of the solid rocket boosters are lined with panels of
ablative material that is designed to burn away during the firing of
the rocket. This action keeps extreme heat from penetrating the
interior of the rocket nozzle.
   Between the panels of ablative material, Mitchell said, engineers
designed in a small gap to allow for thermal expansion.
   ``As just one more little protection, we inject an RTV (room
temperature vulcanizing) silicone in there,'' he said. ``From time
to time, we get some gas past this thermal filler.''
   But he said the rocket booster nozzle is designed to accommodate
this gas leakage and that the leak seen on the Discovery rocket
engines was not unexpected or damaging. Two O-ring seals are the
primary protection against leak of the gas and neither of these
seals showed that they had been touched by superheated gas or flame.
   Mitchell said that during full-scale tests of the rocket motor,
an unfilled 10-inch gap was left between the ablative panels of the
nozzle ``to demonstrate that we're tolerant'' to a leak through that
gap.
   ``Not even the sheen was taken off the surface of the O rings,''
Mitchell said of the test.
   The accident that destroyed Challenger, which blew up 73 seconds
after liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center in January 1986, was
blamed on the leak of gas or flame from a field joint of a solid
rocket booster.
   Since then, the rocket engines have been redesigned and tested
with full-scale firings. The Discovery launch in September, the
first shuttle mission since Challenger, used the new rocket design.
   Mitchell said engineers are only now beginning to examine the
engines used last week for the launch of space shuttle Atlantis, but
that no problem has been found with those rockets.
   ``This is a good motor,'' he said. ``We're ready to fly again.''
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for January.

<HEAD>Brennan Illness Sparks Speculation Over Bush Appointees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An aging liberal bloc on the Supreme Court,
anchored by ailing Justice William J. Brennan, is prompting renewed
speculation on the impact President-elect Bush will have on the
court's future.
   Brennan, hospitalized Thursday with pneumonia, was reported
Friday to be improving at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. Court
spokeswoman Toni House said he may miss little time on the bench
since the high court begins a four-week recess Monday.
   Brennan, 82, is the court's oldest justice and senior member in
terms of service.
   He is two years older than the court's two other most consistent
liberals, Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, both 80.
   Aside from Brennan's current bout with pneumonia, the three have
appeared to be in good health and have given no signs they plan to
step down anytime soon.
   Including Justice John Paul Stevens, 68, the average age of the
court's liberal bloc is over 77.
   By contrast, the average age of the five more conservative
members is slightly under 60.
   That group includes three appointees of President Reagan: Sandra
Day O'Connor, 58, named in 1981 as the first woman on the high
court; and Antonin Scalia, 52, and Anthony M. Kennedy, 52, both
named during Reagan's second term.
   In addition, Reagan elevated William H. Rehnquist, 64, to chief
justice to succeed Warren E. Burger.
   The ninth justice, Byron R. White, 71, an appointee of President
Kennedy, votes more often with the conservatives on key issues.
   While Brennan's illness lends new drama to conjecture about the
high court's future, Bush may have a more immediate impact on the
lower federal courts.
   Bush is expected to search out conservatives to fill the existing
41 federal court vacancies _ 32 trial judgeships and nine appeals
court posts. There could be many more for the president to fill over
the next four years.
   Observers doubt that Bush will be as devoted to conservative
ideology as Reagan, who made 375 judicial appointments, filling more
than half the total.
   Guessing Bush's likely Supreme Court appointees is a parlor game
with conflicting clues.
   The president-elect has said he likes ``moderate people with
conservative views.''
   He also pledged during the campaign to pick judges ``who will
interpret the Constitution, not legislate from the bench.''
   ``I will appoint judges who don't reserve all their sympathy for
criminals, who understand that victims have rights, too,'' Bush said.
   As further evidence of Bush's conservative leanings, he supported
Reagan's unsuccessful attempt to place Robert H. Bork on the high
court.
   Bork, opposed for his conservative ideology, was defeated last
year in a bruising political battle in the Democratic-controlled
Senate.
   Associates of Bush are quick to point out that the
president-elect was a close friend of the late Potter Stewart, a
moderate justice with much the same upper-class lineage.
   Asked if Bush was likely to pick someone closer to Stewart than
Bork if there is a Supreme Court vacancy, Bush spokeswoman Sheila
Tate declined to speculate.
   ``That's a pothole over which I will leap,'' she said.
   A Republican strategist who requested anonymity predicted Bush
``will not choose anyone who is anathema to the movement
conservatives'' _ the Republican ideologues who rallied around Bork.
   That strategy may rule out Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the
former governor of Pennsylvania whose conservative credentials have
been questioned.
   Thornburgh himself said in a recent interview with The Associated
Press that ``judicial restraint'' is a qualification for the bench.
He said he favors picking the best person available.
   Bush also has said he will not impose a litmus test on judicial
appointees. Anti-abortions would like assurances that the next
justice, if given the chance, will vote to overturn the high court's
landmark Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973 that legalized abortion
nationwide.
   Legal experts offer a cross-section of names, including some
moderates, when asked to speculate on likely Bush choices for the
high court.
   The largest group consists of federal judges and includes the
following Reagan appointees to the bench:
   _Patrick E. Higgonbotham, 49, an appeals court judge in Texas
praised for his intelligence. He could face conservative opposition
because of a 1986 ruling that threw out anti-abortion laws.
   _Ralph K. Winter Jr., 52, an appeals court judge in Connecticut.
   _J. Harvie Wilkinson III, 44, an appeals court judge in Virginia.
   _Kenneth W. Starr, 42, a judge on the prestigious and important
federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., and another in the
prominent coterie of youthful conservatives picked by Reagan.
   _Pamela A. Rymer, 47, a federal judge in Los Angeles since 1983.
   Possibilities from outside the judiciary include:
   _James A. Baker, 58, Bush's close friend and choice to be
secretary of state. But GOP insiders doubt Baker is interested in
becoming a justice.
   _Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, 54, one of the nation's most
conservative lawmakers who led the defense of Bork during the Senate
confirmation battle.
   _Carla A. Hills, 54, named by Bush to be U.S. trade
representative.

   President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, entered
Bethesda Naval Hospital today for physical exams and
post-cancer-surgery tests to see if they have remained free of any
malignancy.
   Both Reagans called out ``fine'' when reporters asked about their
well-being as they entered Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban
Maryland.
   Reagan, wearing bright blue running shoes, said he was ``going to
be on a tread mill'' as part of his battery of exams and therefore
had donned the footwear.
   Due to a light snowfall dusting the nation's capital, the
president and his wife dropped plans to fly by helicopter and
instead traveled by motorcade from the White House to the hospital.
   The president was to undergo a range of tests, including his
sixth colonoscopy, or examination of the intestine. The first lady
was scheduled to have her second post-surgery breast X-ray.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he did not expect a
report from the president's physicians until early in the evening.
The Reagans were slated to leave the hosptal for Camp David, Md.,
around 5 p.m. EST.
   Earlier in the day, the spokesman said Reagan has gotten a
positive report from his dermatologists, who examined him on
Thursday and pronounced him free of any new skin cancers.
   Reagan had skin cancers removed from his face in August of 1985
and again in June of 1986.
   Fitzwater said three physicians, including Capt. Theodore
Parlette, the chief of dermatology at the Bethesda Naval Hospital,
conducted a visual examination of Reagan's skin on Thursday and they
``did not detect a change'' in his condition.
   Col. John Hutton, the presidential physician, said in a statement
released Thursday that neither the president nor the first lady has
shown any ``clinical suggestion of recurrence'' of cancer.
   ``Both the president and the first lady have remained completely
asymtomatic,'' Hutton said.
   Reagan, who turns 78 in February, had a two-inch cancerous polyp
removed from his colon in July 1985.
   The 67-year-old first lady had her left breast removed in October
1987 after a cancerous tumor was detected.
   Hutton's statement also included a plug for the importance of
such routine examinations.
   ``The first lady continues to emphasize the importance of
mammography (breast X-ray) for early detection of cancer of the
breast. The mammogram remains the most essential diagnostic test for
early detection of a malignancy,'' he said.
   Hutton's statement said Reagan will have a colonoscopy, a chest
X-ray, a CAT scan, a cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function
evaluation.
   The first lady will have her second mammogram since undergoing
the surgery, an operation known as a modified radical mastectomy, in
which the entire breast is removed, along with some lymph nodes.
   Physicians involved in the evaluation will include Hutton and a
colleague in the White House medical unit, Dr. Martin Bacon; Dr.
Bruce Lloyd, a cardiologist; Dr. Thomas Walsh, a specialist in
pulmonary disease; Dr. David Hartman, a radiologist; Dr. Rocco
Volpe, a specialist in gastroenterology; and Dr. Elsworth Weatherby,
a specialist in nuclear medicine. All are on the naval hospital
staff.
   Also participating will be Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo
Clinic surgeon; his son, Dr. John Randolf Beahrs, who is a physician
in private practice in St. Paul, Minn.; Dr. Robert Beart and Dr.
David Utz of the Mayo Clinic, the statement said.
   The elder Beahrs is an old friend and associate of Mrs. Reagan's
stepfather, the late Dr. Loyal Davis of Chicago.
   In the president's initial cancer surgery, doctors removed the
two-inch cancerous polyp and nearly two feet of colon, as well as
the surrounding tissue.
   Since the 1985 surgery, Reagan has undergone five colonoscopies
to check for any recurrence of cancer. In that procedure, a long,
flexible instrument that uses fiber-optic technology is inserted in
the large intestine to allow doctors to see inside the bowel.
   Each time, except for the last such test in anuary, doctors found
small, fleshy growths known as polyps and removed them. In each
procedure, the polyps were found to be noncancerous.
   The growths generally cause no serious symptoms but, if left
alone, can grow into cancerous lesions.

   Police officers posed as trash
collectors and rode on santitation trucks to gain the confidence of
drug dealers in a sting that resulted in 16 arrests.
   ``Once they saw the uniform and the truck, they trusted us,''
said one of the three undercover officers involved. ``They'd
approach us and say, `You guys want rocks? You want a smoke?' We
were approached by several ladies of the night who gave us lots of
information on the crack houses in the neighborhood.''
   The monthlong operation, which ended Thursday, was organized
after city sanitation workers told police that they were offered
drugs as they made their rounds.
   The officers said they gamely adjusted to the aroma their
disguises required. ``It was just part of the job,'' said one.

<HEAD>Juastice Reported Responding Well to Treatment for Pneumonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan
reportedly responded well to medical treatment Friday, a day after
he was hospitalized with pneumonia.
   Kathy Arberg, a Supreme Court spokeswoman, quoted doctors as
saying that Brennan, 82, was ``continuing to improve and resting
comfortably.''
   His pneumonia was being treated with antibiotics, she said.
   Ms. Arberg said Brennan might return to work early into a
four-week recess the court will begin Monday after issuing orders
and possibly announcing decisions.
   Brennan, the court's oldest and most senior member, was taken by
ambulance to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban Maryland
on Thursday after visiting a doctor at the U.S. Capitol.
   The justice left his office because he was suffering from a fever
and chills.
   A source close to Brennan who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the justice felt well enough Friday to ask that some of his
court work be delivered to his hospital room.
   Brennan participated in the court's oral arguments Wednesday, and
reportedly has enjoyed good health recently.
   His last hospitalization occurred in August 1987 when he checked
into the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for tests on a troublesome
prostate gland. The tests revealed he did not have cancer.
   In 1979 Brennan had a stroke that left his right hand partially
paralyzed, and a year earlier he was treated for a cancerous growth
on a vocal cord.
   Brennan was appointed to the nation's highest court by President
Eisenhower in 1956.

<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists on Friday spent $240 to
buy seven live lobsters from a suburban Maryland restaurant and fly
them to a new home off the coast of Maine.
   Cam McQueen of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals picked
up the lobsters from the House of Chinese Gourmet in Rockville, Md.,
about 10 a.m., took them to Washington National Airport and boarded
a flight to Portland, Maine, a PETA official said.
   Members of the U.S. Coast Guard then were expected to escort her
and the lobsters to a boat station to release the creatures into
their new ocean home, PETA spokeswoman Victoria Thomas said.
   The House of Chinese Gourmet is popular among local vegetarians
who were offended when owner Jack Sun introduced the lobster tank
about a month ago, Ms. Thomas said.
   ``All of the sudden they put up a 125-gallon tank with live
lobsters, and there was a big outcry,'' she said. ``All their
vegetarian clientele got very upset.''
   Sun agreed to get rid of the lobster tank, Ms. Thomas said,
provided the animal activists bought the lobsters and arranged for
their freedom. The total cost of the lobster rescue was $240 _ $40
for the lobsters and $200 for the flight. The Coast Guard donated
its services.
   Maine is noted for its prime lobster growing areas.
   ``The water is cooler, and lobsters prefer that,'' Ms. Thomas
said.
   Ms. Thomas said there were no plans to free lobsters waiting to
be entrees in other restaurant tanks in the Washington metropolitan
area.
   ``We particularly targeted that restaurant because we knew they
had a big vegetarian clientele,'' she said.

   Students at a conservative
Christian school were given National Rifle Association coloring
books on gun safety Friday, and the superintendent dismissed any
criticism as ``ridiculous and non-scholarly.''
   The Christian Liberty Academy distributed the six-page books to
students from kindergarten through fifth grade.
   ``They're constantly being exposed to guns on TV, at the movies,
in the comics of every newspaper'' said the Rev. Paul Lindstrom,
superintendent of the 325-student school and its affiliates and
home-schooling program, which involve a total of 25,000 pupils.
   ``If we get good feedback we'll order more'' books for other
schools, he said.
   ``Children coming across an actual gun will be inquisitive. Nine
chances out of 10 they'll pick it up and finger it. Chances are they
will get hurt,'' Lindstrom said.
   ``We teach them to honor their father and mother and God by not
playing with it.''
   ``My Gun Safety Book'' features two children who find a handgun
on a table. If children find a gun, the book stresses, they should
leave it alone, leave the scene and tell their parents.
   Some educators and law enforcement officials believe such a book
takes the wrong approach because it assumes guns will be available
to children. Some critics say the NRA, the nation's strongest
advocate of the rights of gun owners, should have no role in
educating youngsters.
   But Tracey Martin, who heads the coloring book project for the
NRA, said the organization has promoted gun safety for 117 years and
the book is ``just part of our continuing obligation.''
   Lindstrom also dismissed criticism of the effort.
   ``It's a knee-kerk reaction that is ridiculous and
non-scholarly,'' he said.
   The conservative activist, who spent 10 days in an Atlanta jail
after protesting at abortion clinics in August, said he's interested
in the safety of children.
   ``I don't have any great love for the American Civil Liberties
Union, but if the ACLU comes out with a coloring book that says you
shouldn't go with strangers who offer candy, I'll use that coloring
book in the school,'' Lindstrom said.
   ``I'm an educator. I'm interested in the message,'' Lindstrom
said. ``We use books from all kinds of publishers. They might have
all kinds of political agendas.''
   Ms. Martin said said Friday from NRA headquarters in Washington
that the Christian Liberty Academy got the books through Jim
Zangrilli, an NRA board member in the west Chicago suburb of Oak
Park.
   She said the organization has not formally started a campaign to
distribute the books.
   ``We haven't done any promotion of it. We don't really have the
classroom kits finished yet,'' she said.
   However, public schools in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and
Pennsylvania have requested copies, she said, declining to name
specific schools without their permission. The book also is being
considered by Chicago public school officials, said school board
spokesman Ken Moses.

<HEAD>School Halts Teaching Of Religious Carols After Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An elementary school music teacher
has agreed to stop teaching religious Christmas carols because a
Jewish parent complained it violated her child's constitutional
rights, officials said.
   Sandy Miller will not teach carols such as ``Silent Night'' or
``God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen'' for the rest of the holiday season,
officials of Colorado Springs School District 11 said Thursday.
   School district officials said they will try to determine whether
carols are appropriate for district classrooms, spokesman Paul Kemp
said.
   ``We're asking our attorneys to research it legally, and we'll
take a look at our curriculum adoption policy in the area of music
and see if we are meeting the needs of all children,'' Kemp said.
   Miller and the parent who complained about the carols, Sari
Escovitz, declined to comment.
   The constitutionality of singing religious Christmas carols in
school involves the same First Amendment concerns that have led the
U.S. Supreme Court to bar officially sanctioned school prayers, said
Richard Collins, a professor and specialist in constitutional law at
the University of Colorado at Boulder.
   ``The question is, is this school's involvement in the Christmas
season extensive enough to constitute religious observance?''
Collins said. ``It depends on the coerciveness of the school and the
depth and seriousness of the observance.''

<TEXT>
   A white beauty pageant winner
renounced her title because of hostility from blacks, it was
reported Friday.
   Lisiane Braile, 19, told reporters she was booed and physically
threatened after being elected Carnival Princess in Porto Alegre, a
southern city of 1.1 million residents about 950 miles southwest of
Rio.
   ``I renounced for my physical safety, because I was threatened in
anonymous phone calls that I would suffer in the flesh for winning
the title,'' she said in an interview with the Rio newspaper Jornal
do Brasil.
   Miss Braile competed against 28 black and mixed-race women for
the honorary title of Carnival Princess in February's pre-Lenten
festival. Blacks traditionally dominate the annual festivities.
   During the beauty competition, ``several black people asked,
`What's that white girl doing here?''' Miss Braile said. When she
won, the largely black audience booed and insulted her, she said.
   A majority of Brazil's 144 million people are black or
mixed-race, and racism is a crime under the Brazilian constitution.
Although the government tries to promote an image of harmonious race
relations, discrimination _ mostly against blacks _ is still
widespread.

<HEAD>Mongolian Official Welcomes Soviet Troop Reduction</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior Mongolian official on Friday
welcomed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's pledge to reduce
Soviet troop strength in this Central Asian country and said the
process already has begun.
   First Deputy Foreign Minister Daramyn Endon said all the Soviet
troops could be pulled out if relations with China continue to
improve.
   ``We don't think there is a need for foreign troops,'' Endon told
a news conference.
   He said Mongolia and its close ally, the Soviet Union, had
decided to cut a large portion of the Soviet garrison in Mongolia in
order to strengthen mutual understanding and trust with other Asian
countries, especially China.
   Gorbachev told the United Nations on Wednesday he planned to
reduce the Soviet army by nearly 10 percent and unilaterally reduce
the Soviet troop presence in East Europe and Mongolia.
   Endon refused to say how many Soviet troops will be withdrawn or
by when. He said military experts have yet to make those decisions.
   ``I can only say that a large part of the Soviet troops will be
withdrawn,'' he said. ``The process has already begun and will
continue until the end.''
   The presence of about 1 million Soviet troops along China's
border, including those inside Mongolia, has been one of the major
obstacles to ending the nearly 30-year-old Chinese-Soviet rift.
   Last year the Soviet Union withdrew one division containing about
12,000 troops from Mongolia, leaving about 50,000 by Western
estimates. They are believed to be confronted by an equal number of
Chinese soldiers on the opposite side of the 2,900-mile-long
Chinese-Mongolian border.
   Endon praised recent improvements in Chinese-Mongolian relations
that have accompanied the warming trend between Beijing and Moscow.
He said there has been much progress toward normalization of
government and party relations. The two countries signed trade and
consular agreements in 1986.
   He said Mongolia's foreign minister will visit China next year
for the first time since the Chinese-Soviet split.
   Endon noted that during the 1950s, when Mongolia and China were
on good terms, Mongolia did not station any troops along its border
with China. He said Mongolia ideally would be able to cut its own
military forces if relations with China continue to improve.
   ``Instead of sending our young men to the army we could use them
in the building of socialism,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   La Coupole, the landmark Left Bank restaurant where
struggling young artists like Chagall and Picasso traded their
paintings for hot meals, reopened Friday after eight months of
renovations restoring its 1920s decor.
   ``La Coupole is more than a restaurant; it's an institution,''
said Jean-Paul Bucher, La Coupole's new owner.
   Bucher, president of the Groupe Flo chain of brasseries known for
good food, fair prices and quick service, said the Coupole
``machine'' still had to be oiled and would get off to a slow start
so as not to disappoint regular customers.
   The menu still features house specialities like lamb curry, steak
tartar and baked Alaska, and there are welcome additions from Flo's
nouvelle cuisine fare. Prices have been held down, Bucher said, and
the lamb curry, served with three tasty chutneys, can be had for $15.
   La Coupole has been a watering hole for artists and
intellectuals, movie stars and politicians since it opened 61 years
ago with Jean Cocteau, Man Ray, Andre Derain and Louis Aragon on
hand for the champagne.
   A decade later, Ernest Hemingway and Willian Faulkner nursed
double scotches there while Henry Miller and Lawrence Durrell played
chess long into the night.
   The post-World War II generation of existentialists made La
Couple their haunt. Until his death in 1980, Jean-Paul Sartre
lunched there daily with Simone De Beauvoir.
   The Coupole's main dining room is a classified historical
monument and renovations of its vintage 1920s decor cost an
estimated $5 million.
   On hand for the inaugural lunch of foie gras, scallops, chicken
fricasee and an orange mousse cake washed down with vintage Medoc
wines was Rene Lafon, 91, the Coupole's original owner.
   ``Entering the restaurant I was very happy to find my Coupole,''
he said.
   The famed 32 pillars, wrapped with original, but mostly unsigned
canvasses painted by artists from the School of Paris _ turned out
to be a Pandora's box.
   Under the cracking plaster, workmen found a type of emerald green
stone that looked like marble. Though it was once the rage of Paris
and still adorns the facade of some of the city's loveliest
buildings, repairs were no easy matter: this man-made stone is no
longer manufactured.
   The paintings themselves had been darkened beyond recognition by
60 years of smoke and cooking grime. They are now more resplendent
than ever, thanks to four well-positioned spotlights on each post.
   ``We can really see the enormous variety of styles and colors
adopted by painters of the School of Paris,'' Marie Lyse de
Castelbajac, head of the restoration team, told The Associated Press.
   She said very few of the paintings are signed, and are thus a
mystery that is unlikely ever to be solved.
   ``One painting has Picasso colors, but its forms are pure
Modigliani, so it's hard to say for sure whose it is,'' she said.
``I guess that will always be part of La Coupole's charm.''

<DATELINE>JABALIYA, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Refugees in this camp where
the Palestinian uprising began a year ago were shut inside their
shacks under military curfew Friday, but they said jailings and
economic hardship wouldn't halt their rebellion.
   ``We are preparing for a long struggle. Palestinians have reached
a point of no return,'' said a medical official in Jabaliya, the
largest and most militant camp in the Gaza Strip.
   Jabaliya's narrow dirt alleys were deserted Friday except for a
few goats picking through garbage piles. The occasional roar of an
army jeep was the only sound breaking the silence. A few residents
peered from the windows of their cement and corrugated tin huts.
   On Dec. 9, 1987, the camp was the site of the first demonstration
in what came to be known as the ``intefadeh,'' or uprising. About
1,000 Palestinians shouting ``Death to the Israelis'' and chanting
Islamic slogans hurled stones at soldiers. Troops opened fire,
killing 17-year-old Hatem Abu Sisi.
   Since then, more than a dozen residents have been killed in
clashes and more than 1,000 treated for gunshot and beating
injuries. The camp's 60,000 refugees have been confined to their
homes for 116 days in the past year, and money is tight.
   Most young men are in jail. ``The next generation has taken their
place,'' said the medical official, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The stone-throwers are now 13 and 14 years old.''
   Palestinians throughout the occupied territories seem to have
settled in for a long confrontation with Israel while trying at the
same time to maintain some normalcy.
   ``This has become our way of life,'' said a 24-year-old teacher
for handicapped children who would only give his first name, Emad.
   Scores of members of his extended family were gathered in the
lush backyard of his home in Gaza City's middle-class Rimal
district. In the past year, it has become a clan custom to meet
during strikes and curfews to help pass the time, Emad said.
   The uprising has touched even the youngest, Emad said. He pointed
to his nephew, Ahmed, a 2-year-old with curly blond hair who was
hiding shyly behind one of the adults. ``The first word he learned
was soldier, not mother or father,'' Emad said.
   Emad said he had planned to get married on Saturday, but had to
postpone the wedding because of Friday's indefinite curfew which
confined the Gaza Strip's 650,000 residents to their homes.
   At Ahli Arab Hospital, a five-minute drive away, doctors had
settled into their ``strike day'' routine. During strikes called by
the PLO-backed underground leadership, the casualty toll usually
rises, in part due to increased army raids.
   ``In the beginning, we were completely overwhelmed by the number
of casualties,'' said a senior surgeon who refused to be further
identified. He said 4,200 patients had been admitted in the past
year, most with injuries sustained during the uprising.
   Now, all doctors are on duty on strike days. Elective surgery is
postponed and patients with light injuries are sent home to free
beds.
   On Friday, only few clashes were reported in Gaza, and by midday
doctors had only treated four beating victims.
   In the West Bank refugee camp of Balata, four Palestinians were
wounded after Moslem noon prayers, Arab hospital officials said.
   The relative calm was, in part, the result of the curfews and
heavy army presence. Dozens of jeeps patrolled Gaza City's streets,
and foot patrols combed Jabaliya and the nearby Shati camp.
   The low level of violence also indicated that Palestinians are
shifting their emphasis from street confrontations to
nation-building as the uprising enters its second year. The
Palestine National Council declared a Palestinian state during a
Nov. 15 session in Algiers.
   As part of the effort, local popular committees run by pro-PLO
activists organize anti-crime patrols, provide first aid, visit
families of those killed and settle disputes.
   Israel has outlawed the committees, but activists said the groups
continue to function, taking the place of the old leadership of clan
heads and and Israeli-appointed officials.
   ``We will have a state, but we don't expect it quickly,'' said
Sammy, 26, a top activist in the outlawed Shabiba youth movement of
PLO chief Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. ``In the meantime, it's
important to show we are a nation.''

<NOTE>Eds: Updates in top 5 grafs with Bush-Hooks meeting, picking up in

<TEXT>
   The executive director of the NAACP said today
that President-elect Bush told him he intends to appoint a black to
his Cabinet.
   Hooks, a Democrat, spent about 30 minutes with Bush, discussing a
range of issues of concern to blacks, including judicial and Cabinet
appointments. Hooks called the session ``very cordial.''
   Asked if Bush had pledged to name a black to a high-level job,
Hooks said, ``I think I do remember him saying there would be a
black in the Cabinet.'' Hooks then said it was his ``distinct
recollection that he said he intends to do that.''
   Hooks said he suggested to Bush that the president-elect convene
a White House conference on race and poverty after the inauguration
next month.
   On Thursday, Bush met with 60 black Republicans who had
campaigned for his election.
   Joshua Smith, a businessman from Rockville, Md., said the group
expressed concern that a black has yet to be tapped for the Cabinet,
but said the meeting was friction-free.
   ``We have great hopes,'' he said. ``We have confidence he is
going to follow through on his promise.''
   Arthur Fletcher, a Washington businessman and official in the
Nixon and Ford administrations, said, ``There is reason to believe
there could be a black appointed to one'' of the domestic Cabinet
jobs still unfilled.
   Vacancies remaining include those at the departments of Health
and Human Services; Housing and Urban Development; Energy; Interior;
Veterans Affairs, and the newly created drug czar.
   Bush, according to Smith, told the black supporters ``that we
will over the term be pleased. He did not make any specific
commitments as to numbers and individuals.''
   Fletcher said one problem facing Bush is that there are so few
black Republicans qualified for administration jobs.
   ``They would have to look all over the place,'' said Fletcher,
who called the dearth of black Republicans ``a tragedy,'' and called
for stepped-up GOP recruitment of blacks.
   The blacks said they were pleased with the energetic session they
had with Lee Atwater, tapped to be the new Republican National
Committee chairman.
   Since the election, Bush has appointed nine people to
Cabinet-level posts and selected a handful of others for powerful
jobs.
   Among those selected are one woman, Carla Hills, named as the
U.S. trade representative, and one Hispanic, holdover Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos.
   While blacks have been mentioned for leading jobs, they have not
been given any of them.
   Alan Keyes, a former State Department official who ran
unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Maryland this year, was
thought to have a good chance of becoming U.N. ambassador. The
position was given instead to Thomas Pickering, a career diplomat
who has served as ambassador in El Salvador, Israel, Nigeria and
Jordan.
   Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, president of the Morehouse School of
Medicine in Atlanta, is under consideration for secretary of health
and human services.
   Sullivan said he has told Bush transition aides he was interested
in the No. 1 job at that department but not in the second job.
   Robert Woodson, a black businessman from North Carolina, is in
the running for secretary of housing and urban development. But the
leading prospect appears to be Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   In other transition developments:
   _Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, D-Ark., is being pushed for the
job at the veterans department. Rep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss.,
chairman of the House Veterans Committee, and Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y, wrote Bush in support of Hammerschmidt.
   _A group of Western senators is recommending four people for the
post of interior secretary. The prospects include Richard Richards,
a one-time RNC chairman; Rep. Barbara Vucanovich, R-Nev.; Warren
Morton, former speaker of the Wyoming House, and Rep. John Rhodes of
Arizona.
   _Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said Bush may be making ``his first serious misstep'' by
prolonging speculation over whether former Sen. John Tower will be
appointed defense secretary. For weeks, there has been speculation
that Tower is the leading contender for the job.
   _Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, who flew on the space shuttle, says he
is not interested in running the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. Among others reortedly in the running are Sally
Ride, the first American woman in space; William Graham, science
adviser to President Reagan, and Frank Borman, former president of
Eastern Airlines and an ex-astronaut.

<TEXT>
   The Arab League said Friday it will campaign to
make the Palestine Liberation Organization an observer-member of the
United Nations, putting the organization on a level with Switzerland
and the Vatican.
   ``We are now going to try and get a resolution that would make
the Palestinian state an observer-member of the United Nations,''
Clovis Maksoud, the league's U.S. and U.N. representative, said at a
news conference.
   The session was called primarily to discuss next week's special
U.N. General Assembly meeting in Geneva at which PLO Chairman Yasser
Arafat will speak. Arafat was denied a U.S. visa on grounds he has
been involved in terrorism.
   The league, formed in 1945, comprises 21 Arab states and
``Palestine,'' which it says is represented by the PLO.
   The PLO is currently one of two groups with permanent observer
missions to the United Nations, the other being the South-West
Africa People's Organization. The current status recognizes their
claim to represent peoples.
   The new designation would rank the PLO among ``non-member
states,'' elevating the status of the Palestinian people in
Israeli-occupied territory.
   Maksoud said there would be no point in trying to make the PLO a
full member, because it could not win approval by the United States
in the Security Council. But, he added, ``Maybe this can be a
transition to full membership at a later date.''
   The non-member states are Monaco, North and South Korea, San
Marino, Switzerland and the Vatican.
   Discussing the Israeli raid Friday at Naameh, 50 miles inside
Lebanon, Maksoud called it a ``pre-emptive strike against the peace
option'' and timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the
start of uprisings in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``This is a signal of further oppression yet to come,'' Maksoud
said. ``This is unprovoked violence by Israel. There has been no
provocation. It is an attempt to destabilize Lebanon and to continue
its illegal occupation of the south of Lebanon.''
   Maksoud criticized President Reagan's comment at his news
conference Thursday night that Arafat's statement Wednesday saying
the PLO accepts Israel and rejects terrorism ``in all its forms''
was ambiguous.
   ``We consider that Mr. Arafat's statements have been clear,
unequivocal and categorical,'' he said. ``There isn't any
ambiguity.''
   Maksoud said that ``to include the uprising within the context of
terrorism, as the reaction of the United States seems to include, is
mind-boggling and unacceptable.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials and employees of USA Today are
concerned about an unusually high number of miscarriages among women
working in its newsroom.
   Some employees at the newspaper's suburban Washington
headquarters fear that a reported 14 miscarriages among 100 women
employees over the past 15 months may be partially attributed to
several months of construction work in the offices or to prolonged
exposure to video terminals.
   Editor Peter Prichard said Friday that the company is giving
``close attention'' to the matter.
   Senior Editor Wanda Lloyd, who confirmed only that there have
been ``some miscarriages,'' said: ``Certainly the company is
concerned about anything to do with employees. I'm concerned. I'm
very concerned.''
   But she also said: ``This is an internal matter and a very
personal matter for the women involved. We're still looking into it
and we don't really have any more to say.''
   The Washington Post on Friday reported that 14 miscarriages had
occurred among USA Today employees since September 1987.
   Scientists say about one in seven pregnancies ends in a
miscarriage and that there have been studies of about a dozen
cluster occurrences in the United States and Canada since 1980. A
common thread in the incidences was the use of video terminals in
the offices, although no direct link has been made between their use
and pregnancy problems.
   A USA Today reporter, who asked not to be identified, said the
company brought in experts on video terminals to discuss any danger
they might pose and has been taking an informal survey of employees
to determine the extent of the problem.
   Management also has sent out a memo telling employees not to talk
about the miscarriages, the employee said.
   ``The sheer magnitude of the construction work caused a lot of
concern,'' the reporter said. ``Guys with jackhammers were breaking
up walls right next to your head. You'd walk in to find your
terminal covered with dust. And there were weird smells, very
pungent odors.
   Allen J. Wilcox, an epidemiologist who has studied miscarraiges
for the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said he
had no personal knowledge of the USA Today cases but they appear to
be significant enough to merit study.
   He said, however, it was possible the occurrences were only
coincidence and it is likely no cause will ever be proved. Extensive
epidemiological studies would be required to determine whether there
was any common cause, he said, since a number of factors could have
contributed to each case.
   The Post did not say how many staff members had been pregnant,
but one employee said there were no successful pregnancies among
women working on the two floors that have been undergoing
rennovation since April.
   Gannett Co. Inc., which owns the internationally distributed
newspaper, recently hired a consultant to test materials being
installed during renovation, the Post reported.
   ``There's a lot of concern in the building about the
construction, especially among women who have miscarried,'' said
Peter Johnson, a general assignment reporter interviewed by the
Post. He said the company appeared to be ``genuinely concerned''
about the problem.
   ``Everyone is real frightened,'' a women who had a miscarriage
and who asked not to be identified, was quoted by the Post as
saying. ``You don't know what's going on. It's really an ordeal.''

<HEAD>District Endorses Plan To Save Okeechobee, Delays Details</HEAD>

   A sweeping plan to stop the pollution of Lake
Okeechobee was endorsed by water directors Friday, but they delayed
adopting details of the regulatory program until February, pending
more hearings.
   The plan envisions strict limits on farm runoff into the lake,
limits that some farmers say could drive them out of business.
   The nine board members of the South Florida Water Management
District voted unamimously to approve a resolution supporting limits
on the overall pollution content of the 700-square-mile lake, the
nation's largest fresh-water lake outside of the Great Lakes system.
   The policy change comes in the wake of increasing phosphorus
pollution over the last two decades that has spawned deadly algae
blooms, wiping out fish and native plant species. One recent reading
found phosphorus levels at a historic high in the nation's largest
fresh-water lake outside of the Great Lakes system.
   Water from the lake flows into the Loxahatchee National Wildlife
Refuge, into Everglades National Park and to water-conservation
areas that recharge the Biscayne aquifer, southeastern Florida's
primary water supply.
   Michael Finley, superintendent of Everglades National Park, said
that the plan could prevent the lake from becoming little more than
a retaining pond for polluted water.
   ``But if it's finessed, delayed and circumvented, then it's going
to be the year 2002, and the nutrient front (phosphorus) will still
be a cancer moving south, and we will have lost more of Florida's
resources,'' Finley said.
   One factor prompting the toughened standards was a federal suit
filed by U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen accusing the district and the
state of failing to protect water quality in the interconnected
water system of the lake, Kissimmee River and Everglades National
Park.
   Lehtinen had said he might consider dropping the suit if the
district adopted the new standards, but spokeswoman Diane Cossin
said Friday that the office would wait until it could examine the
final plan.
   The biggest potential losers in the battle over phosphorus
pollution, which comes principally from fertilizer and cow manure,
are the sugar cane growers and dairy farmers who surround the lake.
   Philip Parsons, representative of the Florida Sugar Cane League,
said the new rules may drive cane growers in a few areas out of
business, although most would be able to survive the runoff limits.
   He complained about the direction of policy, however, saying its
aim seemed to be to force growers and dairy farmers to retain their
runoff on their property.
   ``If you say that to the city of Miami, the city of Miami
wouldn't exist. What are you going to do _ tear down the public
library and build a retaining pond?'' Parsons said.
   Environmentalists, who support the district plan, said the
situation cannot be compared with city sewage disposal.
   ``This is a scarce resource,'' said Joseph Podgor of Friends of
The Everglades. ``You cannot equate Lake Okeechobee to a trash
dump.''
   The district's pollution management plan would require all
lakeside farms to decrease the phosphorus content of their runoff at
least one-fifth by 1991, and they must meet interim goals before
then. Some dairy farms would have to cut phosphorus levels by more
than 80 percent.
   The district was required to submit a draft plan to the state by
December under the state's Surface Water Improvement and Management
Act.

   A Geraldo Rivera show with former lobbyist Paula
Parkinson talking about a previously reported and denied alleged
incident with Vice President-elect Dan Quayle has been yanked by the
parent company.
   ``After a careful review, the Tribune Entertainment Co. has
determined that the `Geraldo' program titled `Washington
Confidential' will not be broadcast,'' the company said in a
statement Friday.
   ``Tribune is exercising this discretionary right as a matter of
programming judgment. Geraldo Rivera did not agree with this
decision but he understands it.''
   ``I am very angry,'' Rivera was quoted as saying in Friday's
editions of USA Today about the decision Thursday on the show taped
Nov. 3. ``It is censorship and it is appalling to me even when it is
my friends that are doing it.''
   The show featured Parkinson talking about what she had previously
said about Quayle in ``Washingtonian'' magazine, Rivera said. The
show also featured allegations of affairs by former President Nixon
and Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y.
   Rivera told the newspaper the decision had less to do with the
content than other recent shows, especially one ``Geraldo'' show
with Nazi youth in which Rivera's nose was broken and a special on
satanic cults that was panned.
   ``I think they're running scared because of all the Geraldo
bashing,'' Rivera said. ``I think they are reacting to the very
negative critical reaction to us.''

   What is a Christmas display without a laser
light show anyway?.
   Striving to outdo himself, Al Copeland, the owner of Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken, has added the light show and artifical snow to
his gaudy annual holiday display _ the one the Louisiana Supreme
Court forced him to move away from his home in suburban New Orleans.
   Now at his corporate headquarters near a New Orleans shopping
center, the display featuring more than a million lights was to be
lit up for the first time this season Friday.
   Copeland started his Christmas displays outside his suburban
mansion in the early 1980s, but they grew to the point that
thousands of people would jam the streets to gawk at the lights and
giant figures of reindeer, Santa Claus, a snowman and angels.
   Unhappy neighbors went to court and, in 1985, the state Supreme
Court ordered the display turned off and dismantled. Copeland moved
the show to his corporate offices two years ago.

   The ``binocap'' and shoestring holders
beat out the doggie doorbell and flavored clarinet reeds in a
5th-grade battle of inventors.
   Jeremy John Alberhasky said he hated holding binoculars during a
football game so he invented the binocap, combination headwear and
binoculars, by gluing snap-out pocket binoculars to a baseball cap.
   The 11-year-old was one of the winners at Regina Elementary
School's invention contest.
   Katie Drop, 10, also was a winner with shoelace holders made out
of Velcro fasteners.
   ``Shoelaces always come undone and you trip on them,'' she said.
``I put Velcro on so they stay up.''
   Everyday problems were on the minds of most of the young
inventors.
   Tired of awful-tasting clarinet reeds, Lucy LePeau, 11, dipped
some in peppermint and orange extract.
   Katie Lacina, 10, invented a doggie doorbell so she would not
have to constantly check to see if her dog wanted to come inside.
She tied a spring, bell and bone to a piece of string so her dog
could announce its arrival by pulling on the bone.

<HEAD>Judge Upholds Law Protecting Low-Income Housing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge, ruling in the nation's first case
challenging the constitutionality of the Emergency Housing
Preservation Act, upheld the law in an opinion favoring low-income
tenants in a gentrifying neighborhood.
   Although other courts do not have to follow its example, the
ruling could influence other challenges to the 1987 act, which was
designed to protect rent-controlled, federally subsidized private
housing for low- and moderate-income families, an attorney for the
plaintiffs said Friday.
   Attorney Daniel Burke called Thursday's ruling a victory for rent
rights of the poor, who are threatened by an increasing number of
young professionals moving into renovated inner-city neighborhoods.
   U.S. District Judge James Moran issued his ruling in a
class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of 600 residents of a North
Side building.
   The act prohibits private owners of federally subsidized housing
from immediately charging higher, market prices for rent if the
change would result in a reduction of available low- and
moderate-income housing.
   The case Moran ruled on involved owners of a 209-unit apartment
building who sought to pay off a federally insured mortgage 20 years
early.
   The partnership that owns the building, known as the 833 Buena
Joint Venture, gave the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development $1.8 million in January to pay off the mortgage and then
sent eviction or rent-increase notices to the 600 residents,
believing the paid-off mortgage had exempted them from the
regulations.
   The owners maintained that the housing preservation law was
unconstitutional and deprived them of their property without due
process.
   And in any event, they said, they paid up before the president
signed the bill on Feb. 5, Burke said.
   But Moran noted that the law clearly had a retroactive effective
date of Nov. 1, 1987, and said HUD had made ``a conscious choice to
ignore a legislative demand'' in accepting the prepayment, said
William Wilen, another attorney for the plaintiffs.
   Moran's ruling means the building ``will remain under HUD
regulatory control. It means rent increase proposed in February were
unlawful,'' Burke said.
   The building's owners did not return phone messages Friday and
their attorney, Ellen Babbitt, refused to discuss the case.
   Burke called the ruling ``an influential decision in that it's
the first decision of any court ... on the constitutionality of the
act,'' he said.
   ``Other courts are not bound by this judgment but we think ... it
will affect their decisions'' on similar challenges to the law, he
said.
   Wilen said one similar case is pending in federal court in
Raleigh, N.C.
   ``What the law provides is that an owner who wishes to prepay (a
federal mortgage) has two options. One is to prove to HUD that the
prepayment and resulting rent increases would not have a harmful
effect for housing opportunities for low-income people and
minorities,'' Burke said.
   Under that option, owners ``would have to demonstrate that
there's a ... surplus of low-income housing'' in their neighborhood,
he said.
   ``If they can't establish that ... they can ask for additional
financial incentives from HUD,'' such as an increase in subsidies,
that would still keep them under federal jurisdiction, the attorney
said.
   The owners of the Buena building did neither, he said.

<HEAD>Current Sunspot Cycle among Biggest Ever Recorded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunspot activity that peaks in about a year
could be the second most intense since Galileo first saw the solar
eruptions in 1610, and might knock satellites off course, cause
scattered blackouts and disrupt phone calls and radio broadcasts,
scientists say.
   Sunspots are relatively cool, dark, 1,200- to
60,000-mile-diameter eruptions that appear where the solar magnetic
field is most intense. They emit solar flares, explosions that send
protons, X-rays, electrons and other radiation streaming outward,
sometimes causing magnetic storms on Earth by disrupting the Earth's
magnetic field.
   Most effects are subtle _ rare flickering of lights and poorer
connections for satellite-relayed phone calls or television shows _
so ``the average guy on the street won't know if we're in the throes
of a major magnetic storm,'' forecaster Joe Kunches said Friday.
   ``They may notice the disturbance, but they won't know why,''
often wrongly blaming the phone company for noise on long-distance
lines, he said by phone from the Space Environment Services Center
in Boulder, Colo., the government's forecasting agency for the
storms.
   The average person also ``might not get his favorite radio
station as well as he likes,'' or might notice the northern lights
or aurora borealis farther south than usual, NASA physicist Kenneth
Schatten said during the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting
in San Francisco.
   A so-far successful prediction that the current solar cycle would
be exceptionally large was issued in early 1987 by Yale University's
Sabatino Sofia and Schatten, of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland.
   A NASA news release said some scientists believe the ``solar
maximum,'' or peak of the cycle, might be the biggest since 1610,
when Italian astronomer-physicist Galileo Galilei first observed
sunspots.
   But Schatten and Sofia predicted this cycle won't be quite as
large as the 1958-59 solar maximum, ``and we have no reason to
change that,'' Schatten said Thursday.
   Schatten said the sunspot cycle lasts about 11 years, with the
previous maximum in late 1979, the last minimum in September 1986
and the upcoming maximum expected as early as late 1989, much
earlier than the 1991 date originally forecast.
   Magnetic storms are not dangerous to people on Earth. But they
pose a potentially lethal proton radiation hazard for spacewalking
astronauts and spacecraft electronics, said Schatten and Ron Zwickl,
head of research at the Boulder-based Space Environment Laboratory.
   Excess ultraviolet light from solar flares heats Earth's
atmosphere, expanding it to produce drag that can make satellites in
low orbits fall to Earth prematurely, they said. The U.S. Spacelab
fell to Earth after an intense solar flare in 1979.
   ``Some key missions may be affected,'' forcing NASA to plan
spacecraft launch dates and adjust orbits to minimize the problem,
Zwickl said.
   ``If there had been a man on the moon in August 1972 (during a
flare of protons), he would have absorbed a lethal dose of
radiation,'' Zwickl said, adding that proton emissions in the cycle
should peak between 1991 and 1993.
   Sometimes magnetic storms cause major blackouts, as was the case
in upstate New York about a decade ago, Zwickl said.
   Kunches said X-rays from flares disrupt military and other
communications that cross polar areas or bounce signals off the
layer of Earth's atmosphere called the ionosphere.
   Zwickl said no one knows why solar maximums vary in intensity.

<TEXT>
   A 9-year-old boy who was struck by a car and
killed while riding his bicycle carrying two vials of cocaine lived
a tumultuous life that included a brush with death at age 4 and a
drug entanglement two months ago.
   ``He was a nice boy, full of humor. He was really active, busy,
but he really didn't do anything bad,'' said Barbara Butler, an
instructor at Bethany House Ministries, a church center in Francisco
Martinez's neighborhood.
   The last time Ms. Butler saw Francisco was Nov. 29, the day he
was struck by a car while pedaling his bicycle on a busy, four-lane
road in suburban Ross Township. He died of head injuries Monday at
Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   Francisco was only 4 when his mother, Larita Welch Martinez, then
25, dropped him to safety from the second story of a burning
tenement housing drug addicts and alcoholics in Boston.
   The Rev. Hurshel Langham of Boston, who caught Francisco that day
in January 1983, remembered Francisco as friendly and intelligent.
   ``The thing that amazed me was how he was able to survive in
there with all of the drunks and junkies. I was totally impressed
that he could live in that environment and be so well contented,''
said Langham.
   Ms. Martinez was convicted of arson for allegedly setting the
fire, which killed four people. She was sentenced to life in prison,
and Francisco was sent to live with his grandparents in Pittsburgh.
   Two months ago, police searched the home Francisco lived in with
his grandparents and an aunt and uncle after family members told
police Sept. 2 that the aunt, 20-year-old Renee Welch, was acting as
a drug courier and planned to get drugs in New York, according to
records in Allegheny County Court.
   Ms. Welch would not let officers search her bedroom. After police
left, Francisco went to his aunt's bedroom, but his uncle and
grandparents stopped him as he tried to leave and found 40 bags of
heroin and cocaine in his clothes.
   The aunt, who was charged with multiple drug offenses and
corrupting a minor, is free on bond awaiting trial.
   Meanwhile, Ross Township police Sgt. Frank Zotter said
investigators are looking for links between the vials Francisco was
carrying when he was struck and drug residue found in containers
taken from the aunt's bedroom.
   Tests also showed Francisco had alcohol in his blood when he was
struck. Family attorney Joseph K. Williams III said the boy was
asthmatic and had been taking cough syrup that contains alcohol.
   The boy had been seen riding his bike erratically on the same
highway in the days before he was struck, and police were responding
to a similar report when the fatal accident occurred, Zotter said.
   The teen-age driver was charged with leaving the scene of an
accident.
   The bike seemed to be one of the few constants in Francisco's
life.
   ``On a nice day he'd bring his bike down and park it and play out
back,'' said Sharon Brown, a worker at Bethany House Ministries.
``He loved his bike.''

<HEAD>Soviets Think They Could Win European War With Fewer Troops, Study
Says</HEAD>

   NATO should be cautious about Soviet proposals
for deep reductions in European troop levels because Krelim leaders
believe they still could win a war with fewer soldiers than they
have now, a congressional study said Friday.
   The report by a trio of congressional agencies was completed
before the announcement of troop reductions made Wednesday by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev, in a United Nations speech, said the Soviet Union
would reduce its military forces 10 percent worldwide. That would
include the withdrawal of some Soviet troops and tanks from Eastern
Europe.
   Friday's report was prepared by the General Accounting Office,
the Office of Technology Assessment and the Congressional Research
Service. It was done in response to last year's Pentagon budget
bill, which ordered a wide-ranging study of the military balance
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union
and its Warsaw Pact allies.
   The study sounded four major warnings about the onging
U.S.-Soviet efforts to negotiate lower levels of troops and military
power in the European theater. The cautionary notes were based on
the possibility of a Soviet attack on NATO.
   The study said:
   _``First, because the Soviets do not believe that they must have
superiority across the theater in order to achieve victory, caution
must be exhibited in any agreement for force reductions.''
   It noted the Soviets now enjoy at least a 2-to-1 advantage in
many major measures of military might. But it noted that ``Soviet
writings suggest that the Soviets could have a force advantage
across the theater of as little as 1.25 to 1 _ or even parity _ and
still achieve victory.''
   _``Any overall symmetrical reduction in forces would not be to
NATO's advantage, given that lowering the density of forces, by
Soviet calculations, would aid the attacker and make rapid advance
and maneuvers easier.''
   _``Unless all equipment is disabled or destroyed, the Soviets
could agree to force reductions, knowing that a dramatically reduced
division would be capable of regneration in a few weeks.''
   _``Finally, NATO should not expect any significant unilateral
reductions on the part of the Soviets _ either to promote good will
or to pressure NATO into an equivalent response _ that would not
also be in the Soviet Union's own military and political interests.''
   The report studied Soviet military attitudes toward the West and
concluded that ``Soviet planners believe that they have a marginal
advantage in the conventional balance in Europe today, although they
are far less optimistic about the future.''
   The Soviets don't believe they need a numerical advantage to win
a military attack, the study said. ``Instead, the ability to mass at
decisive places and times with sufficient forces to achieve their
objectives is the key.''
   While the Soviets have roughly a 2-to-1 manpower advantage now,
the Soviets apparently have concluded that a 1.5-to-1 force
advantage _ or even parity _ across the entire theater may be
sufficient to enable their forces to achieve a 3- or 4-to-1 force
advantage on a few breakthrough sectors and 4- to 8-to-1 advantage
at the tactical point of penetration, the study said.
   The study was prepared by a variety of experts, including
Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, head of the GAO; former arms
negotiator Jonathan Dean; Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of
the House Armed Services seapower subcommittee; Lawrence Korb,
former assistant secretary of defense; and James Woolsey, former
undersecretary of the Navy.
   The report offered no clear answer to the question of who is
ahead _ NATO or the Warsaw Pact. It noted that ``neither side has
such an overwhelming advantage that its victory would be assured.''
   But it added that ``most scenarios favor the Warsaw Pact as the
victor rather than NATO. NATO has a chance of success, but it needs
to address its many shortcomings to enhance that chance.''
   The study said ``despite problems in measuring the NATO and
Warsaw Pact force balance, the experts agreed that NATO's peacetime
deterrent position is good and that its conventional capabilities
have improved over the last decade, but they should be better.''
   If the Soviets struck quickly, NATO likely could do a good job of
defending the West, the study said. But in a long fight, the balance
might swing toward the Warsaw Pact because of NATO shortcomings in
logistics and stockpiles of weapons and ammunition.

<HEAD>Tower Weakened by Appointment Holdup Over Background, Lawmakers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Key lawmakers warned on Friday that the
drawn-out selection process is politically weakening John Tower,
George Bush's expected choice for defense secretary. But Bush's
incoming chief of staff said such delays are unavoidable.
   John Sununu refused to discuss what's behind the delay. However,
Tower's supporters and a transition source who declined to be named
said it was primarily an FBI check believed to be delving into the
former Texas senator's personal life and allegations made by his
ex-wife.
   ``If being thorough in the system creates a problem, then you
have to accept that,'' Sununu said in an interview. ``I can't
imagine anybody who is criticizing us who would suggest to us that
we find a shortcut through a system that ought to be allowed to
cover all the details as efficiently and as effectively as you can.''
   Tower, who was an arms negotiator for President Reagan after
retiring from the Senate, has long been considered the top candidate
for the Pentagon post.
   ``You always wish things could go faster,'' Sununu said. ``And
yet, in today's world, the worst thing you could do is to do things
quickly rather than thoroughly and that applies to all appointments,
not just the Tower one.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a backer of Tower and adviser to
President-elect Bush on defense, said, ``They (FBI) are checking
allegations and rumors _ womanizing, drinking involvement in defense
contracts.
   ``They seem to be surfacing all the time,'' McCain said in an
interview. ``All allegations have to be put to rest so there is no
embarrassment at a later date. From their viewpoint I wouldn't do
anything different. It's just sad that it's harming John Tower to
some degree.''
   McCain said Tower's former wife ``obviously has been feeding''
the rumors and ``provding grist for the mill.''
   A source close to Bush, commenting only on condition he not be
named, said, ``I think just that the FBI checks are taking a long
time. John Tower had a messy divorce. And his wife has suggested
17,000 different problems. ... And every single one of those has to
be checked out.''
   Bush said this week he was ``disinclined to believe'' allegations
about Tower.
   Sununu, who will step down soon as governor of New Hampshire,
said on other subjects in the interview:
   _He will not return to New Hampshire in two years to run for
office. ``I want to be chief of staff for eight years with this
president; I want to give him the best eight years a president has
ever had,'' he said. Sununu still has money left over from his
gubernatorial campaign, and said, ``Some day I might come back to
New Hampshire and run for office, governor or senator or whatever.''
   _Direct access to the Oval Office will be guaranteed to the chief
of staff, deputy chief of staff and the national security adviser.
As for Vice President-elect Dan Quayle, Sununu said, ``They (Bush
and Quayle) are going to work out their arrangement, and obviously
whatever the vice president (Bush) decides is the way to work will
be the way we work.''
   On Tower, Sen. McCain expressed concern about the delay, saying,
``The longer it takes, there's bound to be an impact on his stature.
I don't think it's significant now but it could be if it drags on
much longer _ more than a week or two. Then I think it starts
becoming serious.''
   Similarly, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said, ``I think anyone
who is allowed to hang out as the designated nominee without any
confirmation from the president-elect is bound to suffer a thousand
wounds.
   ``I think they should move quickly to resolve the position, and
if it's going to be Tower it should be in the very near future, and
if it's not going to be Tower they should say so.''
   Cohen said he, too, understood the nomination was being delayed
by background checks. Moreover, he said Bush's team has been
debating whether the Pentagon chief should be a managerial type or a
policy maker.
   ``I think they have come to the conclusion the secretary should
be the policy maker and that the deputy should be the manager,''
Cohen said.
   ``I have talked to Tower and I think he would like to have a
strong manager as a deputy,'' the senator added. ``He (Tower) is not
going to be dealing with the minutiae of procurement reforms.''
   As for Tower's personal life, Cohen said he has known Tower since
1978.
   ``I don't think John Tower professed to be a saint to anyone but
I don't think that's what we're looking for.'' He said he had never
``witnessed any excess in drinking or anything else'' by Tower.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said in a speech, ``If Tower is named defense secretary,
he will come into office in a weakened position. ... For one thing,
with all that twisting in the wind, questions will be raised about
how much confidence the president has in him.''
   McCain said he still expected Tower to get the job. Cohen said,
``Barring any unforeseen disclosures in the FBI investigation that
we have not already heard about, I would expect him to be the
nominee.''
   A top aide to Bush, speaking privately, said, ``I still think
it's a 75 percent bet.''

   A conservation group Friday unveiled an attempt
to wrap the message of tropical forest conservation in a rap music
videotape.
   The six-minute videotape made by the U.S. affiliate of the World
Wildlife Fund should be seen by ``5 million to 7 million kids'' next
year in 50,000 schools, said Grace M. Lieberman, member of the fund
staff and co-author of the teacher's manual that accompanies the
tape and other materials.
   Interspersed with shots of exotic animals, birds, plants and
reptiles in the jungles of Peru and Brazil, a group of youngsters
about 10 years old dances through New York City streets and the
Botanic Garden on the Mall in Washington.
   The lyrics reveal the rocky metrics, pulsing beat and sustained
rhyme of typical rap numbers:
   ``The red-eyed frog has suction pads to cling _
   ``They climb vertically, I guess that's their thing.
   ``Howler monkeys, now they got the style,
   ``Their howls can be heard over half a mile
   ``And that's a caiman, waiting a while
   ``For its prey to come, it's related to the crocodile.''
   The teachers' kit was made in cooperation with the Smithsonian
Institution, whose Traveling Exhibition Service is sending a
tropical forest exhibit to 14 cities.
   The fund will give 1,000 copies of the tape and teaching
materials to host institutions in those cities. Others will be asked
to pay $20 per kit or $5 for the tape alone.
   Conservationists say 27 million acres of forest, an area bigger
than Austria, are lost around the world each year through logging
and conversion to farmland, threatening the existence of thousands
of exotic species not even studied yet by scientists, local
environmental damage and exacerbation of the greenhouse effect
warming of the earth.
   ``We surveyed teachers across the country and they told us in a
world of MTV we couldn't use film strips and slide shows'' and hold
students attention, said Ms. Lieberman.
   The idea for the tape came from the rap video idea advanced by
staffer Sally Russell, who produced the tape.
   A grant of $75,000 from Chevron Corp. supported the project.

   Jessica Rabbit, President and Mrs. Reagan and the
co-stars of ``Roseanne'' were among the most romantic people of
1988, according to a list released Friday by Korbel champagne.
   Jessica Rabbit, the animated femme fatale from Disney's ``Roger
Rabbit,'' was chosen because she ``risks all to help her man,'' the
sponsor said.
   The Reagans ``helped set the tone for the return of romance in
America during the '80s,'' it was noted.
   Roseanne Barr and John Goodman, stars of the TV series
``Roseanne,'' remind prime-time viewers ``that beauty really is in
the eye of the beholder and that love and romance can flourish even
in non-urban, non-yuppie and non-upscale settings,'' the sponsor
said.
   Other winners were George Burns, for ``Gracie: A Love Story,'' a
tribute to his late wife, Gracie Allen; Olympic diver Greg Louganis,
described as ``boyish and irrepressible''; and Charles Kuralt, for
his television glimpses into ``the real romance of America.''
   Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, the Ben & Jerry ice cream
entrepreneurs, were cited for contributing 7.5 percent of their
company's pre-tax profits to charity; AIDS researcher Mathilde Krim,
for ``showing the world that compassion is as important as
science''; John G. Healey, executive director of Amnesty
International U.S.A., for organizing the ``Human Rights Now!''
concert tour; and actress Susan Sarandon, 42, for showing that
``it's class, not age, that makes a leading lady romantic and sexy.''

   The former captain of a U.S. warship
whose alleged failure to help a boatload of starving Vietnamese
refugees apparently forced them to resort to cannibalism will be
court-martialed, a Navy spokesman said Friday.
   Capt. Alexander G. Balian, 48, of Los Angeles, was relieved of
his duties in August after Vietnamese refugees claimed the USS
Dubuque did not assist them when it met up with their boat in the
South China Sea on June 9.
   United Nations officials said 52 of the refugees later reached
the Philippines but 58 died during the 37-day voyage. Survivors said
two Vietnamese died of starvation but three others were slain and
eaten by fellow passengers.
   U.S. Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said Friday that the
commander of U.S. naval forces in the Philippines, Rear Adm. Roger
L. Rich, ordered the court-martial after reviewing findings of an
investigation conducted at the U.S. Subic Bay naval base and in the
Persian Gulf, the Dubuque's destination when it spotted the
Vietnamese boat.
   Mukri said no date had been set for the court-martial, but it
probably would be held at Subic Bay, 50 miles west of Manila.
   The investigation, which corresponds to a civilian grand jury
probe, was completed Oct. 28 and forwarded to Rich on Nov. 7, Mukri
said. It found that the Vietnamese vessel was out of food and water
and with an inoperative engine and sails when it encountered the
Dubuque.
   Balian claimed the boat was seaworthy and that the crew provided
food, water and navigational directions.
   Mukri said the investigation determined that the Dubuque failed
to provide food, water and clothing, even though some of the
refugees were naked, dehydrated, and weakened from their ordeal at
sea.
   He said Balian faced seven charges, including failure to render
assistance to a vessel in distress and failing to determine the
condition of the vessel. He said Balian, who is now in Sasabo,
Japan, could be dismissed from the Navy and imprisoned for two years
on each charge if convicted.
   Balian also was charged with failing to rescue a Vietnamese
refugee who jumped into the water and tried to swim to the port side
of the Dubuque, Mukri said. He said another Vietnamese tried to
climb a rope ladder on the side of the Dubuque, but the crew shook
it and he fell back into the sea.
   The Dubuque also did not report the location of the Vietnamese
vessel by radio so that other ships in the area could render
assistance, Mukri said.
   Quoting the report, Mukri said the Vietnamese vessel left Vietnam
on May 22. By the time it encountered the Dubuque on June 9, there
were 83 men, women and children, including one infant, still alive,
the report said.
   Filipino fishermen later rescued the refugees. They were taken to
the Philippine island of Palawan, where they were cared for by
Filipino and U.N. authorities.
   One of the refugees, 10-year-old Hung Quoc Tran, was reunited
late last month with an aunt and grandmother in El Dorado, Ark.,
about 120 miles south of Little Rock.

   Norman Roth did himself a big favor 30
years ago when he helped develop the first heart pacemaker. Now he
has one for himself, after emergency surgery.
   ``It was just the sort of thing that all the work we did a good
number of years ago was all about,'' Roth, 57, said Thursday in his
room at St. Joseph's Hospital. ``All of a sudden, you're on the
other side of the fence.''
   An ambulance picked up the Shoreview resident Wednesday and
rushed him to St. Joseph's, his heart erratically thumping 10 and 20
beats a minute. For 20 to 30 seconds, he said, it wouldn't beat at
all. He was suffering from second-degree heart block, a potentially
fatal disruption of the heart's electrical system.
   Cardiologists implanted into Roth's upper chest one of
Medtronic's latest pacemakers, a double-lead model that stimulates
both of the heart's pumping chambers.
   ``I feel fine,'' Roth said Thursday. ``Things are coming along
nicely. Once you get the unit in there it stabilizes quickly. All of
a sudden my hands and feet are warm again.''
   In the late 1950s, Roth, then a biomedical engineer, worked with
Samuel Hunter, a St. Paul surgeon, to develop what was called the
Hunter-Roth bipolar electrode. They worked with animals in a
laboratory at St. Joseph's and in a north Minneapolis garage that
was the center of Medtronic Inc. operations in those days.
   Roth said he has been out of the engineering business for many
years and now works as a financial consultant.
   He said his heart block condition was first diagnosed 15 years
ago, but didn't progress until about a year ago. He was planning to
arrange an appointment to get a pacemaker implanted when his heart
began to sputter Wednesday.

<HEAD>Sakharov, Walesa Arrive For Human Rights Celebration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, each making his first visit abroad
since winning the Nobel Peace Prize, arrived Friday to join a human
rights celebration.
   The two men, who were planning to meet for the first time during
the weekend, were invited by President Francois Mitterrand for
ceremonies marking Saturday's 40th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
   Mitterrand, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and
UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor were scheduled to speak
Saturday at the Palais Chaillot overlooking the Seine that will be
attended by hundreds of dignitaries, human rights activists and
politicians.
   In Oslo, Perez de Cuellar on Friday accepted the 1988 Nobel Peace
Prize check on behalf of the U.N. peacekeeping forces.
   Sakharov, on his way back to Moscow following a four-week visit
to the United States, arrived Friday morning at Charles de Gaulle
Airport and was to be joined by his wife Yelena Bonner on Friday
night for the couple's first trip together outside the Soviet Union.
   Walesa, allowed to leave Poland for the first time since martial
law was declared in 1981, arrived Friday night at the same airport
and told reporters he was looking forward to meeting Sakharov.
   ``We both still feel, he and I, the breath of Stalin at our
backs,'' Walesa said, speaking Polish through an interpreter.
   ``After seven years, here I am at the dawn of something new,'' he
said. ``The Stalin era is over. Now I am waiting for the return to
pluralism and the restoration of rights.''
   At a 90-minute-long news conference at the Soviet Embassy,
Sakharov called for more steps to reduce the size of the Soviet
military. The 67-year-old physicist said one way to do this would be
to limit the length of service for Soviet draftees.
   Commenting on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's offer
Wednesday at the United Nations to cut the Red Army by 500,000 and
withdraw thousands of tanks and troops from Eastern Europe, he said
it was a major decision but only a beginning.
   He said reductions in manpower and weapons ``can be done and will
change in a major way the international situation. Gorbachev is
going in this direction and this is very important. I would have
liked to see bigger cuts but what was done is important.''
   Sakharov, who helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb, previously
was barred from traveling abroad because of his past scientific
work. He was also restricted to the industrial city of Gorky for
seven years because of his outspoken opposition to Soviet
intervention in Afghanistan.
   In 1986, Gorbachev personally called him back to Moscow. Since
then, Sakharov has generally supported Gorbachev's perestroika, or
political and economic restructuring, while speaking out against
some trends, including the growing concentration of power in
Gorbachev's hands.
   He twice sidestepped questions about the political implications
of the meeting he is expected to have with Walesa, who is being
allowed by Polish authorities to make his first trip abroad since
the military crackdown on the independent union seven years ago.
   In an interview published Thursday in the daily Le Monde, Walesa
said he believed authorities granted him the visa because Poland
seeks better relations with the West ``and France can facilitate
this.''
   Walesa, who won the Nobel Prize in 1983, on Thursday told the
French daily Liberation that he was looking forward to meeting
Sakharov, the 1975 prize winner.
   Walesa will confer with French trade unionists, Paris Mayor
Jacques Chirac, actor Yves Montand, Culture Minister Jack Lang and
Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, leader of the French Roman Catholic
Church. Walesa and Sakharov will meet Mitterrand and Premier Michel
Rocard on Saturday.
   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted without
dissent by the U.N. General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948, is the basic
document under which member nations pledge to safeguard life and
liberty and abolish torture and slavery.
   The United Nations commemorated the annniversary Thursday by
honoring anti-apartheid activists Nelson and Winnie Mandela and four
other rights advocates.

   From Communist Party headquarters to street cafes,
East Europeans are giving an enthusiastic response to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's pledge to withdraw some Soviet
troops from Eastern Europe.
   ``It's great, for us it's a real sign of hope for peace,'' said
one East Berlin teacher as she sat with a group of people around a
table in Egon-Erwin-Kisch Cafe on East Berlin's Unter den Linden
boulevard.
   ``The political significance of Gorbachev's words really cannot
be praised enough,'' said a student. Both asked that their names not
be used.
   In a speech to the United Nations Wednesday, Gorbachev announced
a unilateral reduction of 500,000 soldiers _ 50,000 of them in
Eastern Europe _ including the withdrawal and disbanding of six tank
divisions from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany by 1991.
   Soviet allies quickly hailed the speech and said the moves were
discussed with the Kremlin in advance.
   East Germany's Communist leader Erich Honecker, who has refused
to follow Gorbachev's economic and political reforms in his own
country, praised the Kremlin leader's pledge.
   East Germany ``welcomes and fully and completely supports the
far-reaching new initiatives and suggestions,'' Honecker said at a
state reception for Yugoslav President Raif Dizdarevic Wednesday.
   Western analysts say the Soviet Union has about 380,000 troops in
East Germany, the largest force in one of its allied countries.
   East Germany's state-run television broadcast Gorbachev's U.N.
speech live and official newspapers carried the full address under
banner headlines.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi, who is visiting
Beijing, was quoted by the state news agency MTI as telling a news
conference there:
   ``I can say that together with our Chinese partners we welcomed
this initiative of great significance in the greatest accord.''
   Hungarian Defense Minister Gen. Ferenc Karpati was quoted as
saying the Soviet withdrawal would affect about one-fourth of the
Soviet troops in Hungary, indicating about 12,000 Soviet troops
would leave.
   The official Czechoslovak news agency CTK said Friday the
Communist Party Politburo on Friday welcomed the Soviet initiative
``with high appreciation and full support.''
   An estimated 80,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia came to the
country during the 1968 Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed
the short-lived ``Prague Spring'' of liberal reforms.
   Gen. Kamen Petrov, a member of the Bulgarian army general staff,
described Gorbachev's announced steps as a ``program of the 21st
century.''
   Polish Foreign Minister Tadeusz Olechowski, in a statement issued
by the official PAP news agency said: ``The announced pullbacks will
contribute essentially to easing the threat of military
confrontation on our continent, especially central Europe.''
   Jacek Czaputowicz, co-founder of the unofficial group Freedom and
Peace, said he hoped the move would lead to removal of all Soviet
troops from Poland.
   Jacek Szymanderski, another co-founder of Freedom and Peace, said
the Soviet army is ``the most important Stalinist institution in the
Soviet Union.''
   Gorbachev's action was ``very important, one of the most
important steps in the de-Stalinization of Soviet policy,'' he told
the AP in a telephone interview.

   Soweto's new city council will stop
evicting residents of the black township who have taken part in a
3-year-old rent boycott and will not force them to pay back rent,
anti-apartheid activists said Friday.
   The delegation of activists made the announcement after meeting
with the black council for several hours. The delegation included
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, miners union leader Cyril
Ramaphosa and others who in the past have refused to negotiate with
the council.
   The rent boycott is one of the most effective forms of protest
still available to blacks under the 30-month-old state of emergency.
The boycott was launched in 1985 to press a broad range of
grievances against the government. Overdue rent in Soweto alone is
believed to exceed $100 million.
   Authorities have used numerous tactics to try to break the
boycott, including late-night eviction raids such as one in August
1986, which led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a confrontation
with police.
   Friday's meeting came two days after South Africa's highest
court, the Appeal Court in Bloemfontein, ruled that previous
councils of the township had no legal authority to collect rent from
occupants of the thousands of homes built in the 1940s and 1950s by
the city council of neighboring Johannesburg. At the time there was
no separate black administration in Soweto.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general of the South African
Council of Churches and leader of the activists' delegation, said
the councilors agreed that, because of the court ruling, no Sowetan
was required to pay any of millions of dollars of rent withheld
during the boycott.
   Chikane said further negotiations would take place to determine
whether some residents should now be awarded ownership of their
houses and what type of rent or service charges should be paid in
the future.
   He and Tutu indicated activists viewed the new council more
positively than its predecessors.
   ``They are people who want to do good, people who honestly
believe they can change the system,'' Chikane said. ``Whether they
can it, subject to an apartheid Parliament, remains to be seen.''
   ``They told us our grievances were their grievances,'' Tutu said.
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the nation's 26-million
black majority has no say in national affairs. Black local councils
have been denounced by activists as subordinate extensions of the
white-dominated political system.
   Soweto's new council took office following nationwide municipal
elections Oct. 26 which were the target of an illegal but successful
boycott by blacks. About 11.5 percent of the eligible voters in
Soweto cast ballots.
   The new council, seeking to distance itself from the old ones,
proceeded to rehire municipal workers fired during a strike and said
it wanted to consult with community leaders to solve problems facing
its 2.5 million residents.
   One of the consequences of the five-month municipal workers'
strike was an accumulation of trash on roadsides throughout Soweto.
The council is launching a clean-up campaign Saturday, and drew
praise from the normally critical local newspaper, The Sowetan, for
a proposal to pay children to join the clean-up.
   The activists said in a statement Friday that negotiations with
the council would continue only if it were able to guarantee that
community leaders were not harassed or detained as they consulted
with residents.

   The solar panels on the secret spy satellite
launched by the shuttle Atlantis failed to swing open the first time
ground controllers commanded them to, and Air Force officials
briefly feared the mission might fail, an industry magazine reports.
   But, with two astronauts standing by to take a spacewalk if
necessary, a second set of radio commands freed the panels, and the
satellite was successfully deployed high over the Soviet Union,
Aviation Week & Space Technology reported in its Dec. 12 issue.
   The panels are needed to absorb sunlight which powers the
satellite's batteries.
   The magazine, citing Defense Department sources, said deployment
of the $500 million Martin Marietta radar satellite took place on
the shuttle's fifth orbit, or about seven hours after it was
launched at 9:30 a.m. EST on Friday, Dec. 2.
   After the astronauts used the shuttle's robot arm to release the
satellite, they kept their spaceship close enough to watch the
deployment, and were able to visually confirm when it was fully open
to its 150-foot span.
   Had it not, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and Navy Cmdr.
William M. Shepherd were prepared to take a spacewalk to repair or
retrieve the satellite.
   The magazine said Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson first maneuvered
the shuttle to a point about 3 miles from the Lacrosse, then to
about 5 miles away, then further at 5-mile increments.
   These maneuvers were witnessed by a network of amateur
astronomers linked by computers around the world and headed by Ted
Molczan of Toronto, Canada, according to the magazine.
   It said the astronomers observed close-formation flight between
the Atlantis and the Lacrosse on their sixth and seventh orbits. By
Dec. 6, just before the shuttle returned to Earth, members of the
group in Australia observed the Lacrosse about 180 miles from
Atlantis, the magazine said.
   The mission was the third entirely classified shuttle flight, and
neither NASA nor the Air Force released any information about its
purpose. However it was widely reported _ even by the official
Soviet news agency Tass _ that the Lacrosse was being deployed to
observe Soviet and Eastern European military operations through
darkness or cloud cover.
   Such information would be valuable for verifying Soviet arms
compliance. The satellite would also serve as a ``radar eye'' for
the new B-2 stealth bomber.

   The Energy Department on Friday selected a
Bechtel Corp. subsidiary to design the entire disposal system for
highly radioactive waste from the nation's nuclear power stations.
   Separately, the department's Oak Ridge, Tenn., office said it
will enter a five-year extension of existing contracts with a Martin
Marietta Corp. subsidiary to operate four nuclear weapons plants and
a laboratory in Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.
   Under a 10-year contract for about $100 million a year, a team
headed by Bechtel Systems Management Inc. will design the waste
packaging, transportation system, temporary ``monitored retrievable
storage'' depot, if one is built, and the ultimate underground
permanent storage installation currently planned for Yucca Mountain,
Nev.
   Other companies on Bechtel's team are Westinghouse Electric
Corp.; Batelle Memorial Institute; Science Applications
International Corp.; Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade and Douglas; Dames
and Moore; Shannon and Wilson; and Los Alamos Technical Associaties.
   Losing bidders in competition for the contract were TRW
Environmental Safety Systems Inc. and Systems Engineering and
Management Corp., a group formed by Ralph M. Parsons Corp. of
Pasadena, Calif. and Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. of Boston.
   The contracts with Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc. will be
worth about $10 billion over five years, the Oak Ridge office said.
   The two contracts cover the gaseous diffision plants at Oak
Ridge, Paducah, Ky. and Portsmouth, Ohio; the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory; and the Oak Ridge Y-12 weapons component plant. The Oak
Ridge gaseous diffusion plant has been shut down, but employees
there support the other plants.
   The Portsmouth plant has been in a separate contract and the
other four units have been lumped together, but the department said
it was now putting the Oak Ridge installations in one contract and
the Paducah and Portsmouth plants in another.
   This will ``focus management attention on the uranium enrichment
enterprise,'' the department said.
   The current contracts expire next Sept. 30. About 18,800 people
work in the five installations.
   Bechtel is based in San Francisco and Martin-Marietta, in
Bethesda, Md.

   Frightened eastern Long Island residents
stayed inside behind drawn curtains after four men were shot on four
successive nights, including three injured by shots fired through
their windows, police said Friday. One person was killed.
   The shootings in two Long Island communities have enough in
common to point to one gunman, police say, but they have not figured
out a motive.
   The victims apparently do not know one another, police said, but
they believe the four were not shot at random.
   Residents have begun shutting themselves in after dark, drawing
their curtains and responding to callers with extreme caution,
police said. Officials refused to predict that the sniper would
strike again Friday night, but extra patrols were deployed and
state, county and local police held a meeting to coordinate their
investigation.
   All the shootings have occurred after dark, most around
dinnertime, within a two-mile radius in Flanders and Riverhead. The
victims, all men in their 30s, were shot with either a small-caliber
rifle or a lightweight shotgun.
   ``I don't at this point think we have a random sniper loose in
the streets who is just shooting away at anyone he sees,'' said
Riverhead Police Chief Lawrence Grattan.
   The two villages are about 75 miles east of New York, not far
from the exclusive beach communities called the Hamptons, frequented
in summer by the city's wealthy.
   ``You don't know where he's going to go next,'' said Barbara
Bouchard of Riverhead, a neighbor of one of the victims.
   An anonymous caller believed to have been the gunman contacted
Riverhead police after the first shooting Monday and said, ``death
to drug dealers and crooked cops,'' according to a source involved
in the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity. A similar
call came after the second shooting on Tuesday, he said.
   But police said none of the victims was known to have dealt drugs.
   ``We think there is a reason for these shootings, a perverted
type of thing,'' the source said.
   The gunman seems to know the area well enough to be a local
resident. Police theorized that he left a car at a distance from the
scene and approached his targets on foot.
   The shootings occurred this way, according to police accounts:
   _ About 6:40 p.m. Monday, Bernard Heaney, 30, of South Jamesport
stepped outside his auto-customizing shop in Flanders to see why his
dog was yelping. The dog had been shot. Other shots rang out and
Heaney fell fatally wounded by a .22-caliber rifle.
   _ On Tuesday at 6:05 p.m., Richard Jensen, 34, a carpenter, was
watching television with his wife and three children at his home in
Riverhead when a shotgun blast came through the window. Jensen had
his hands clasped at the back of his head and the birdshot blew off
the middle finger of each hand. He also suffered scalp wounds. He
was listed in satisfactory condition Friday.
   _ Theodore Squires, 39, a sign painter, was wounded in the
shoulder by a shotgun at his home in Riverhead about 10:50 p.m.
Wednesday. Squires had answered a knock at the door but saw no one.
He closed the door and started to draw the kitchen curtains when a
shotgun blast through a window in the door hit him in the shoulder.
He was hospitalized in serious condition.
   _ About 6:15 p.m. Thursday, Donald Crump, 31, was shot in the jaw
with a light-caliber rifle bullet by someone firing through a window
as he ate his dinner with his mother and nephew in the living room
of his home in Flanders. The slug came out his neck and lodged in a
wall. He was treated for his wound and released.

<HEAD>Walsh: North Diverted Money to Contras Earlier Than He's Admitted</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with new filing on when North began
diverting money</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House aide Oliver L. North began
using Iranian arms-sale proceeds to arm Nicaraguan rebels two months
before he told Congress the diversion had started, Iran-Contra
prosecutors said Friday.
   ``A substantial quantity of weapons'' were bought for the Contras
in December 1985 from money left over from the aborted sale by
Israel of Hawk missiles to Iran in November 1985, Iran-Contra
prosececutors said in filing in North's case.
   The prosecution evidence contradicts North's congressional
testimony last year that the idea of diverting arms-sale profits to
the Contras was first suggested to him in January 1986 by Iranian
arms dealer Manuchar Ghorbanifar.
   The weapons for the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, were
purchased from what was left of a $1 million fund that North told
Israel to place in a Swiss bank. The money was to cover the expenses
that arms dealer Richard V. Secord would incur when selling 80 Hawk
missiles to Iran.
   The deal broke down after the first shipment of 18 missiles
because the Iranians were dissatisfied with the weapons they
received.
   As a result, ``a substantial windfall was left'' in the account
of Lake Resources, a Panamanian company controlled by Secord,
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh said in the filing in U.S.
District Court.
   ``Aided by this infusion'' of cash, which the 1987 congressional
Iran-Contra report estimated was $800,000, ``the enterprise shipped
a subststantial quanity of weapons to the Contras'' in December of
that year, Walsh said.
   ``Thus, the events of November afforded North his first
opportunity to exploit arms sales to Iran in order to support the
Contras; the stage wa set for the diversion of 1986,'' Walsh said.
   During his testimony before the House-Senate committee hearings
on the Iran-Contra affair, North said the idea of using arms-sale
profits to help the Contras was mentioned by Ghorbanifar during
discussions held to set up the February 1986 sale of 1,000 TOW
missiles to Iran.
   Recalling the Jan. 22, 1986, meeting in London, North said
Ghorbanifar ``suggested several incentives to make that February
transaction work, and the attractive incentive for me was ... that
residuals would flow to support the Nicaraguan resistance.''
   Ghorbanifar agreed to pay $10,000 for each of the 1,000 TOW
missiles, which were to be purchased from the Defense Department
through the CIA.
   At a meeting in Washington the next day, North _ ``in a critical
misrepresentation'' _ told two CIA officials and a Pentagon officer
that Secord would pay the CIA $6,000 per missile or $6 million in
all _ ``when he well knew that $10 million was the negotiated
price.''
   The CIA eventually set the price at $3,700 per missile _ ``for
reasons unrelated to North's statements,'' Walsh said.
   In his latest summary of evidence in the case, Walsh said
prosecutors ``will demonstrate at trial that North played a
significant role in directing expenditures from the enterprise
through witnesses such as Willard Zucker,'' an American lawyer who
operates a Swiss financial company.
   North and Secord are charged along with former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter and arms dealer Albert Hakim with
conspiring to divert more than $14 million in arms-for-hostage
profits to the Contras. Poindexter, Secord and Hakim are to be tried
separately after North.
   Walsh's filing was made as U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
concluded seven days of closed hearings to consder North's
objections to censoring sensitive information from 395 prosecution
exhibits.
   The independent prosecutor, in a separate filing, suggested a
procedure under which uncensored documents could be shown to jurors,
the judge and the witness without revealing the contents to
spectators.
   The arms deals continued, but by the summer of 1986 ``fissures
began to develop in North's scheme'' after the Iranians learned they
were being overcharged as much as 600 percent, apparently when they
obtained a price list for spare parts.
   North asked the CIA to generate a phony price list to
``extinguish the complaints.''
   When confronted by CIA officer Charles Allen with Ghorbanifar's
complaints, North's reaction ``was to question the trustworthiness
of Ghorbanifar.''
   ``Thus, North repeatedly failed to disclose the true origin of
the inflated prices _ his own efforts to generate a surplus for the
Contras. Instead, he attempted to cover his tracks and blame the
problem on Ghorbanifar,'' Walsh said.
   In early October 1986, Allen warned then-CIA Director William
Casey and deputy director Robert Gates that he suspected North and
Secord were diverting profits to the Contras. Allen also warned that
``Ghorbanifar might go public with allegations concerning the
pricing of the weapons.''
   North was fired from the National Security Council staff and
Poindexter resigned in late November 1986 after the diversion was
confirmed in a memo unearthed by Attorney General Edwin Meese III's
investigation.

<HEAD>Bond Set At $1 Million For Robinson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond was set at $1 million Friday for a
man who is charged in a 1986 slaying and is a half-brother of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Noah Robinson has been in jail without bail since September, when
he was charged in the death of Leroy ``Hambone'' Barber and turned
himself in to authorities. Bail had not been posted by late Friday
afternoon.
   Indictments accuse Robinson, a Greenville native and
self-described millionaire, of hiring a group of El Rukn street gang
members to travel to Greenville and kill Barber, a former employee
in one of Robinson's companies.
   Robinson, 46, also is charged with conspiring to kill a witness
to Barber's killing. Five El Rukn members also are charged.
   Robinson has maintained that he is a victim of a political
conspiracy caused partly by the success of his half-brother.
Robinson and Jackson share the same father, but the former
Democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent
contact with his half-brother.
   Last week, Robinson's lawyers asked that Robinson be granted bail
under a state law that requires defendants be released when two
terms of court had been completed without trial.
   Circuit Judge James Moore said Friday that he agreed with the
argument ``because of the court's concern for a fair trial.''
   Moore's decision marked the end of a three-month legal battle
over the issue of Robinson's right to be granted bail.
   Moore said Robinson would be required to put up $500,000 in the
form of a surety bond plus $500,000 in the form of a personal
recognizance bond. Moore added that Robinson would be required to
remain in Greenville County until his trial, scheduled to begin Jan.
16.
   A personal recognizance bond means a defendant is liable for the
amount of the bond, but he does not have to offer documentation that
he has the money.
   Moore also agreed Friday that the murder charges against Robinson
and the charges involving the attack on the murder witness should be
tried separately, to avoid prejudice.

<HEAD>NAACP Leader Says Bush Pledges to Name a Black to Cabinet</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs with Teeter considering deputy chief of staff
post</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The head of the NAACP said Friday that
President-elect Bush, who has yet to name a black to any high-level
position, has pledged to put a black in his Cabinet.
   Bush, meantime, reiterated his promise to make the Cabinet
representative of women and minorities. ``Stay tuned,'' he told
reporters.
   The vice president continued his string of meetings with various
interest groups. He spent about 30 minutes with Benjamin Hooks of
the NAACP before a session with 13 conservatives, including Edwin
Feulner Jr., president of the Heritage Foundation, and Paul Weyrich
of the Free Congress Foundation.
   Feulner said the conservatives urged Bush to place people of
their philosophical bent in high positions.
   ``In effect what we urged was that he make sure that all parts of
the (conservative) coalition continue to have a stake in his success
once he becomes president,'' he said.
   Bush was also encouraged to make greater use of his veto power to
prevent an ``erosion of power'' from the executive branch.
Conservatives do not want to see Congress attain too much power,
particularly in foreign affairs, Weyrich said.
   Also among the conservatives on Bush's schedule was Robert
Woodson, a black businessman from North Carolina who has been
mentioned as a possible secretary of housing and urban development.
Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., is thought to have the inside track for that
job.
   Hooks, a Democrat, said his meeting with Bush was ``very
cordial.'' The two discussed personnel appointments in all levels of
government and the judiciary, as well as issues of concern to
blacks, he said.
   Asked whether Bush had made a commitment to place a black in the
Cabinet, Hooks replied: ``To the best of my recollection, I think I
do remember him saying there would be a black in the Cabinet.''
Hooks then said he had a ``distinct recollection that he said he
intends to do that.''
   Bush has named about a dozen people to top jobs in his
administration so far, only one of them female and none of them
black.
   Hooks, a vocal critic of the Reagan administration's civil rights
policies, said he was confident that his group would have better
relations with Bush.
   ``I expect a much better civil rights record from Mr. Bush,'' he
said.
   Hooks said he asked Bush to think about convening a White House
conference on race and poverty next year, an idea he said Bush
promised to consider.
   Meantime, Robert Teeter, co-director of the Bush transition
office, said he still was trying to decide whether to accept the
post of deputy White House chief of staff under John Sununu, but
that he has been assured direct access to Bush if he does take it.
   Teeter, whose polling data and strategy advice helped propel Bush
to victory in November, said he will decide in ``the next few days''
whether to take the job or return to his home in Michigan with his
wife and two children. ``I don't know what I'm going to do yet,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   In talks with Bush, he said, it has been agreed that he could
fill the dual role of presidential counselor and deputy chief of
staff.

   West Germans on Friday demanded
curbs on NATO military flights over this densely populated country
to halt the toll from crashes that have killed 100 people this year.
   Several NATO members, including the United States, temporarily
suspended training flights after Thursday's fiery crash of a U.S.
warplane that killed five people, but there were calls for permanent
cuts.
   The governor of the state where the A-10 Thunderbolt II crashed
said he will take the issue to the federal Parliament. Another
governor urged Chancellor Helmut Kohl to negotiate with NATO allies.
   On any given day in West Germany, the sky is filled with the
screechings and rumbles of hundreds of jets and helicopters, and
massive opposition has been fueled by recent tragedies.
   Even before Thursday's fatal crash in Remscheid, 12 major
accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year. They
included 70 who died from an air show crash in Ramstein in August.
   The resistance took on added urgency after the A-10 plowed into
Remscheid, a city of 130,000 about 15 miles east of Duesseldorf.
   The pilot, Capt. Michael P. Foster, 34, of Seal Beach, Calif.,
and four people on the ground were killed and 50 others were
injured. Two dozen homes were destroyed.
   The exact cause of the crash was under investigation, but West
German air force Gen. Horst Jungkurth said the pilot ``may have
become disoriented when he tried to climb in heavy cloud cover'' to
get out of bad weather.
   However, the state prosecutor for North Rhine-Westphalia, Joerg
Bachmann, said witnesses reported seeing one of the plane's two
engines on fire before it crashed.
   Capt. Ron Hahn, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force team that went
to Remscheid after the accident, said ``pilot error is one of the
conclusions they (Air Force investigators) could come to. But there
is no way to comment on the likely cause ahead of that.''
   Meanwhile, state Interior Minister Herbert Schnoor accused U.S.
military officials of hindering initial rescue operations.
   ``It took hours before the fire department found out from the
Americans what was in the aircraft,'' he told regional radio WDR.
``At first, there was concern that there could be radioactive
material on board.''
   The jet, designed to support ground forces and fight tanks, was
carrying 1,000 rounds of 30mm training ammunition when it crashed,
U.S. Air Force officials said. One rescuer said ammunition
periodically exploded after the initial crash, hindering rescue
operations.
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Burt and West German Defense Minster
Rupert Scholz visited the site Friday. Burt denied the flight was a
low-level mission, saying the A-10 was flying between 2,500 feet and
3,300 feet before it began to descend.
   In West German military parlance, low-level flights range from
250 to 500 feet above the ground and are restricted to seven rural
areas in the country. But the number of training accidents in recent
years has aroused widespread concern in a country of 61 million
people with an area smaller than Texas.
   Oskar Lafontaine, the popular, leftist governor of Saarland
state, said on Kohl, a conservative Christian Democrat, should start
to work immediately for a ban on low-level training flights and mock
air battles over inhabited areas.
   ``I am calling for negotiations with the allies, as well as a
corresponding decision for the German military, towards the goal of
eliminating any danger to the populace,'' Lafontaine told reporters
in the state capital of Saarbruecken.
   Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic governor of North
Rhine-Westphalia state where the accident occurred, said he will go
to Parliament to seek a reduction of low-level flights over his
state.
   ``I hope that finally all low-level flights over densely
populated areas will be banned, not just until Christmas but
permanently,'' Rau told reporters.
   Bernd Wilz, a leading Christian Democrat in Parliament, said he
and many of his party colleagues are demanding a 30-percent
reduction in low-level training missions.
   Seven NATO nations, including West Germany, fly a combined 70,000
low-level training flights in this country each year, more than in
any other NATO land, according to the Defense Ministry in Bonn.
   The West German Defense Ministry said it will bar training
missions below 10,700 feet until the end of the year and called on
the nation's allies to observe a similar moratorium.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Winfried Dunkel told a news conference
in Bonn that the United States had agreed to the temporary
suspension to be lifted in January.

<HEAD>Sunken Garden Reveals Toxic Wastes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A couple who was able to move into a house
through a county rent subsidy were packing to leave it Friday, three
months after their garden collapsed into a sinkhole of decaying
automotive batteries and they learned they were living on one of
California's toxic ``superfund'' sites.
   ``I thought we had gone through the toughest part,'' said Patrick
Piazza. ``When we got this place, I thought we were finally on the
right track and we could settle.''
   County officials made a ``bureaucratic mistake'' when they moved
Piazza and his family into the home last March, said Marice Ashe,
director of health education for Contra Costa County.
   ``No one should live there,'' she said.
   She said tests showed that lead levels in the ground around the
property, which has been on the state's toxic cleanup list since
1986, were not seriously high but were ``on the borderline of posing
a health threat'' to the Piazza children. Kevin, 12, Crystal, 4, and
Patrick Jr., 3, have been living in temporary quarters while the
move is arranged.
   The Piazzas spent five years living in a 25-year-old school bus
and a hotel before county housing authorities helped them move into
the $850-a-month house last March. The Piazzas paid $167 of the
monthly total; the county subsidized the rest.
   Piazza said owner John Thomas Sr. warned him there ``was a very
slight contamination in the back behind the fence. But that's at
least 50 feet away and I knew the kids wouldn't be playing back
there.''
   So they relaxed and planted a vegetable garden in the front yard.
   On Sept. 10, Piazza left the water on in the garden overnight. He
awoke to find a hole about three feet deep and six feet wide where
the garden had been, and a sinkhole filled with old automotive
battery parts. It's now about 15 feet wide, Piazza said.
   ``I was so shocked it took a few minutes for me just to get my
thoughts together,'' he said. ``It caused a lot of scared confusion
in our minds because we didn't know what it had done to us or our
kids.''
   ``Here we had been growing vegetables on top of all those things
and eating the crops for more than two months,'' Piazza said.
   Cost of the cleanup is estimated at $1 million.
   California voters approved a state superfund program in November
1984 to raise funds to clean up toxic waste sites, modeled after the
federal superfund program. The Oakley site was reported to county
health authorities in 1985, and was put on the state cleanupt list
the following year, though not at the top.
   The county advised the state health department that the cleanup
could be put off a few years because an elderly couple aware of the
possible contamination problem was living there. Lead is
particularly dangerous for children.
   State health spokeswoman Jill Singleton said then-owner R.D. Cook
agreed to notify the county if property use changed. But deputy
district attorney Jim Sepulveda said Cook failed to notify the
county when he sold the property. Cook said the county knew he had
planned to sell the land.
   According to Singleton, Cook is legally and financially liable
for the cleanup, which could cost up to $1 million.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer for eight Arizona sanctuary
workers told a federal appeals court Friday the defendants believed
the Central American aliens they aided were refugees with a right to
live in the United States.
   Attorney Michael Tigar told a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that a trial judge in Tucson, Ariz.,
improperly barred the sanctuary workers from presenting evidence of
their beliefs concerning the refugees from strife-torn nations.
   A government attorney, urging the court to uphold the convictions
of all eight defendants, said it was clear the workers never
believed they were acting legally and knew that smuggling aliens was
against the law.
   There was no immediate ruling on the appeal. At a news conference
following the court session, one of those convicted, Peggy
Hutchison, vowed that the sanctuary movement would go on regardless
of the outcome of the case.
   ``We have a duty to respond to the violated in our midst,'' she
said.
   The eight, including five clergymen, were convicted on various
charges of conspiracy, transporting and harboring and aiding illegal
entry of aliens in a highly publicized 1986 trial. All received
probation. Several other defendants were acquitted, pleaded guilty
to misdemeanors or won dismissal of charges.
   Donald M. Reno, who prosecuted the case in Tucson, said their
conspiracy was clearly illegal.
   ``In this case, these defendants were methodically smuggling
these aliens into the United States,'' he said. ``Everything they
were doing was surreptitious and clandestine.''
   He said the defendants had falsified documents and urged aliens
to lie to immigration officers when asked about their country of
origin.
   Tigar of the University of Texas Law School at Austin described
for the judges his interpretation of the law governing refugees:
   ``Anyone who is a refugee ... has the right to have that status
recognized regardless of his mode of entry (into the country),'' he
said. ``Refugee status is something you have because of something
that happened to you in your country of origin.''
   He said all of the defendants had offered to prove at trial that
all the people they assisted were eligible for refugee status.
   Reno, however, accused Tigar of arguing ``a legal fiction that
refugees are entitled to reside here.''
   Tigar also argued that the defendants' First Amendment rights
were violated when a government informant secretly recorded church
services and Bible classes where sanctuary was discussed.
   Reno responded that none of that evidence was ever used at the
trial, but said it was proper because the church had been
transformed from ``an appropriate exercise of religion on Sunday to
a criminal enterprise on Monday.''
   Ms. Hutchison said the defendants believed they were acting
legally.
   ``When immigration authorities violate the rights of those
seeking asylum, we have a responsibility to protect those rights,''
she said. ``It is humane, it is moral and it is legal, and we will
continue until the violation stops.''
   Supporters of the defendants presented to reporters a woman now
seeking asylum. Vilma Mendez said she was imprisoned and tortured in
El Salvador for belonging to a union.

<HEAD>Christmas Carol Festival Canceled Because of Whites-Only Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOKSBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A yearly multiracial Christmas
carol festival has been canceled because the lakeside park where it
would be held has been declared a ``whites only'' area, organizers
said Friday.
   The sing has taken place at Boksburg Lake, the main park in this
industrial town east of Johannesburg, for four years, but the
far-right Conservative Party administration that just took over has
resegregated the park. The Boksburg Publicity Association said it
canceled the event because of that.
   Conservatives won control of the Boksburg council and dozens of
others in local elections Oct. 26. The Boksburg council voted to
restore ``whites only'' status to the town hall, park and other
facilities that were open to all races in recent years.
   Anti-apartheid leaders, business groups and the governing
National Party denouced the action, and blacks have begun a consumer
boycott of white-owned stores. Several government officials who
criticized the Conservatives come from cities where beaches,
libraries and swimming pools are segregated.

   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle said Friday
that Congress shouldn't try to greatly reduce U.S. military spending
in response to a Soviet pledge to cut troop strength.
   ``Let's not forget that the reason that we're making success with
the Soviet Union and the world is because we have been able to
negotiate from a position of strength,'' he said.
   Quayle, who developed a reputation as a hard-liner on defense
issues while in Congress, said that even if Mikhail S. Gorbachev
follows through on a promise to reduce Soviet troops by 500,000, the
Soviets still will ``have a very significant advantage'' in troops
and weapons in Europe.
   ``I hope that the Congress doesn't try to undercut us and to take
away that position of strength,'' he said. ``I hope that the
Congress doesn't respond and say, `Well, we can dramatically cut
defense spending.'''
   Quayle, commenting on a wide range of topics in an interview with
reporters from his home state of Indiana, denied suggestions he has
been swayed by President-elect Bush's transition team in making
staff appointments and other decisions.
   Referring to the appointment of Time correspondent David
Beckwith, who was more closely associated with Bush, to be his press
secretary, Quayle said: ``It was at my initiative. The appointments
I make will be my appointments and I will be making those decisions
on what I think is best for me and the administration.''
   Quayle said he would be ``a very close personal confidential
adviser to the president'' during Bush's term, and also would focus
on his duties as a member of the National Security Council, as
overseer of the administration's space council, as president of the
Senate and as a promoter of education and job training programs.
   Asked why he had left anti-drug efforts off his list of
priorities, since Bush had led Reagan administration programs in
that area, Quayle said his role had not been determined under new
legislation that calls for appointment of a drug czar.
   He steered clear of speculation over whom Indiana Gov. Robert D.
Orr will appoint to fill the Senate seat that Quayle will vacate,
saying, ``He'll make a good choice, a choice I will support.''
   The vice president-elect also met Friday with conservative Eagle
Forum leader Phyllis Schlafly, Bush national security aides Donald
Gregg and Sam Watson and Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams.
   Quayle told reporters outside his house that in the meeting with
Abrams, whom he characterized as an old friend, they discussed
Central America, Abrams' area of specialty at the State Department.
   Quayle declined to specify what direction the Bush administration
will take on the Nicaragua situation and aid to the Contra rebels,
saying ``those will be major issues, and major strategy we'll have
to formulate,'' but that he could not elaborate on it this early.
   Abrams, whose Iran-Contra testimony revealed he had deceived
Congress about the secret operation to assist the Nicaraguan rebels,
told Quayle he definitely was leaving government to return to
private life, the senator said.
   Quayle said the hardest adjustment he's had to make since
becoming Bush's vice president-elect is learning to live with the
tight security detail that tracks his every move.
   The father of three said he misses ``just sort of now being able
to get in the car and drive down to Wendy's drive-in and get a
milkshake with the kids if you want to.''
   ``We consider ourselves a strong, durable family,'' he continued.
``When you get tested, you actually become close and you become
strengthened in many ways, but it is different.''
   Quayle said the criticism and ridicule he received during the
campaign were difficult to deal with, but ``we knew it was unfair
and wrong. We knew in due time things would be adjusted. You don't
like it but it's part of the political system.''

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Accepts Nobel Check, Chides U.S. For Failing To Pay Dues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.N. chief accepted the 1988 Nobel Peace
Prize check Friday on behalf of U.N. peacekeeping forces, but he
said they are threatened because the United States and other
countries won't pay their dues.
   ``I don't know how we're going to cope financially,'' Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar said before receiving the prize
money of $416,000 _ a fraction of the $450 million in dues owed by
U.N. members.
   ``In some ways it's embarrassing because it forces me to say
publicly that the United States still owes the United Nations almost
$350 million,'' said the U.N. chief.
   ``Yesterday I had a meeting with American congressmen who
complimented me on the peacekeeping forces,'' he said. ``I didn't
want to make a joke, but I told them I thought it would be kind of a
posthumous homage to the United Nations. ... We won't have enough
funds, because you are not paying your contribution.''
   Asked when the U.N. would pay its own peacekeeping force bills to
Norway, Denmark, Britain, Canada and other countries that provide
troops, Perez de Cuellar said: ``They are all understanding. They
think we are honest people. But unfortunately, not everyone is
honest with us.''
   Commenting on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for a
U.N. force to monitor a truce as Soviet troops leave Afghanistan, he
said: ``First of all let us see if a cease-fire is possible. ... It
is of course not a very simple question.''
   On Saturday, Perez de Cuellar receives the traditional gold medal
and certificate from the Norwegian Nobel Committee in a ceremony at
Oslo University's Aula Hall.
   The check handover Friday broke with tradition. It is usually
awarded after the ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death
of Swedish philanthropist Alfred Nobel, inventor of dynamite.
   But the U.N. chief was flying to Paris immediately after the
ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the U.N. Human
Rights Convention.
   Perez de Cuellar cited progress on U.N. efforts to end the
Iran-Iraq war and conflicts in Afghanistan, the Western Sahara,
southern Africa and elsewhere.
   ``I have the impression that all of a sudden so many countries
have discovered that the United Nations is really an extremely
useful mechanism for maintaining peace,'' he said.
   The first U.N. peacekeeping operation was in the Middle East in
1948. Since then, half a million men have served in 15 separate
operations, and more than 700 have been killed. Seven missions are
currently in the field.
   In a report this week, Perez de Cuellar predicted the world body
would end next year with a loss of $24.6 million. Only 79 of the 159
members had paid all their dues by Nov. 30, the report said.
   He said Friday that the Soviet Union owed about $100 million, but
he praised the Soviets for seting a payment schedule and sticking
with it.

<HEAD>French, Soviet Spacemen Overcome Snags to Deploy Test Platform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French cosmonaut and a Soviet colleague overcame
problems outside the orbiting space station Mir on Friday and
unfurled a plastic web in a test of space construction techniques,
Soviet media reported.
   Jean-Loup Chretien of France and Soviet cosmonaut Alexander
Volkov began their spacewalk at 12:57 p.m. Moscow time (4 a.m. EDT)
and were scheduled to complete it in four hours, 20 minutes, the
Tass news agency said. But the spacewalk lasted six hours because of
several problems.
   It took longer than expected to lay a cable linking the plastic
structure's platform to the control panel inside Mir, Tass said.
Then the structure failed to unfold on the electronic command of
cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who was inside Mir.
   While scientists at the Mission Control Center in Kaliningrad
near Moscow studied the problem, the cosmonauts were out of radio
contact. When contact was restored, the cosmonauts exclaimed: ``It's
opened!'' Soviet television reported. The cosmonauts evidently shook
the structure to open it, a TV correspondent said.
   If it proves reliable, the platform could be used to hold
antennas and telescope mirrors.
   Also during the spacewalk, Chretien and Volkov mounted outside
Mir a panel with samples of different materials and coatings.
   After six months, the panel is to be removed and taken back to
Earth for study of how the materials and coatings withstood sharp
temperature fluctuations and solar radiation in space, Tass said.
   The Soviets have said they intend to build large structures in
space for research, and the techniques and materials the cosmonauts
tested Friday should help plan such projects.
   Soviet television provided live coverage of parts of the
spacewalk. It showed Chretien and Volkov, in white spacesuits,
floating outside Mir and working on the experiments. At one point,
they had to stop the work as they passed into a shadow.
   Along with Krikalev, the flight engineer, remaining inside Mir
during the spacewalk were cosmonauts Vladimir Titov, Musa Manarov
and Valery Polyakov.
   Chretien will return to Earth with Titov and Manarov, who have
set an endurance record and will have been in space a full year when
they make the descent Dec. 21. Volkov, Polyakov and Krikalev will
remain on the Mir.
   Chretien and Volkov blasted off Nov. 26.

   The FBI launched a criminal investigation
Friday into the downing of a U.S. locust-spraying plane over the
Western Sahara in the heart of an area controlled by the Marxist-led
Polisario independence movement.
   Meanwhile, an official of the U.S. Agency for International
Development said his view is that whoever shot the plane down ``make
a mistake. These were not military planes.''
   The FBI is looking for possible violations of federal criminal
laws, including one that deals with destruction of U.S. aircraft
overseas, FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich said.
   In opening the investigation, the bureau did not specifically
invoke a 1986 anti-terrorism law which makes it a crime to kill U.S.
nationals outside the United States.
   Five Americans aboard the DC-7 were presumed dead when the craft
was shot down Thursday by a surface-to-air missile.
   Jay Morris, deputy administrator of AID, told reporters the
plane, and another craft accompanying it, were in no sense on a
mission for the United States.
   Morris said the planes had been en route from Senegal, where they
had finished work for AID, to Morocco, where they ``were going to
... seek another job'' spraying locusts for AID.
   Ahlerich said the downed aircraft had been under contract to AID,
but that the contract expired Wednesday. Negotiations were under way
to extend the contracts when the aircraft was shot down, Ahlerich
added.
   Asked if the plane crews had been warned of the risk involved in
flying over the area, Morris replied: ``I don't think anyone knew
they were running a risk.''
   ``My own view is that who ever did it made a mistake,'' Morris
said. ``These were not military planes.''
   Madjid Abdullah, the Polisario's North American representative,
told The Associated Press in Washington the front ``will do
everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and
unfortunate incident.''
   Both aircraft were owned by T&G Aviation of Chandler, Ariz., and
were under contract to AID to spray insects, said T&G co-owner
Sergio Tomassoni, who was in the other plane that was hit.
   Morris said the contracts of the five men presumed dead have been
extended to spare their families the expense of transporting the
bodies back to the United States for burial.
   ``We view this as a tragic and deplorable loss of innocent life
in an effort, really, to save life,'' Morris said.
   Morris said the men were part of an international effort to stop
``one of the most massive insect infestations in decades, a plague
really of biblical proportions.''

<HEAD>Bush Shouldn't Gear Russian Policy To Gorbachev, Former Secretaries
Say</HEAD>

   President-elect George Bush's policy
toward the Soviet Union shouldn't be based entirely on the
pronouncements and personality of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, since
there's no guarantee he'll stay in power, former secretaries of
state said Friday.
   ``Gorbachev acts as he does because he recognizes that the Soviet
economy is a mess and it has to be improved,'' Henry Kissinger,
secretary of state under former presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald
Ford, told a news conference. ``It's a big mistake to gear our
policies totally to one Soviet personality.''
   Cyrus Vance, who directed foreign policy under presidents John F.
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, said Gorbachev faces an uphill battle in
bringing about his desired domestic reforms and likely will fall
from power if he fails.
   ``I think he may be gone in a couple of years,'' Vance said.
   William Rogers, a secretary of state under Nixon, said Bush
should ``continue the policies of the Reagan administration. ... I
think the prospects for peace are very good, (but) we have to remain
strong militarily.''
   The former U.S. secretaries of state were here for the Sixth
Annual Report from the Secretaries of State, sponsored by the
Atlanta-based Southern Center for International Studies and
Nashville's David Lipscomb University.
   They spoke with reporters before taping a two-hour television
special to be broadcast by Public Broadcasting Service stations
early next year.
   There was some disagreement with Reagan. Kissinger reacted
sharply to president's suggestion Thursday that there be talks with
Iran regarding the Lebanese hostages.
   ``I am violently opposed to any negotiations about hostages,
ever,'' Kissinger said. ``Once you begin negotiating on the release
of hostages, you have indicated there is the price and the only
thing left to negotiate is the price _ and therefore, hostage taking
has a reward.''
   ``I know this sounds cruel, I know this is tough on the families,
but I believe that devaluing hostages is the only way you can
prevent hostages from being taken.''
   Kissinger and Edmund Muskie, secretary of state under former
President Jimmy Carter, both predicted the hostages in Lebanon will
be released because it will be in Iran's interest to try to return
relations with the United States to normal.
   Vance criticized the Reagan administration's refusal to admit
Palestine Liberation Organization head Yassar Arafat into the United
States to address the United Nations, calling it ``a serious
mistake.''
   ``It helped those who were opposed to progress in the Middle East
and it disadvantaged those who would like to see us get the peace
process going ahead,'' Vance said. ``I think it makes it more
difficult for the Bush administration to act as an honest broker in
the Middle East.''
   Vance said he that the United States must maintain a strong
military, but said, ``We must remain strong economically as well as
militarily.''
   ``I think one of the things he (Bush) is going to have to deal
with, strongly and effectively, is the twin deficits, the budget
deficit and the trade deficit. ... What he does in regard to that
particular issue is going to have a major effect, in the long run,
on our foreign policy.''
   The forum was held at the invitation of Gov. Ned McWherter, a
trustee of the non-profit international studies organization.

<TEXT>
   A would-be financial adviser who bilked investors
out of $15 million to finance a lifestyle of expensive art and
luxury homes was sentenced Friday to eight years in prison by a
judge who called him ``amoral, not immoral.''
   David P. Bloom, 24, whose swindle earned him the title ``Wall
Street Whiz Kid,'' pleaded guilty in March to one count each of mail
fraud and securities fraud. Most of the investors he conned were
friends of his parents, prosecutors said.
   ``I have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and
betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me,'' Bloom
told the judge.
   He conceded he was ``deserving of punishment'' but his attorney,
David W. O'Connor, sought leniency, saying Bloom was ``a greedy
young man and a product of our times.''
   ``When he grew up, greed was on the ascendency,'' O'Connor said.
``David Bloom shouldn't wind up being the scapegoat of the 1980s.''
   U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein said he found Bloom
``remorseless, completely lacking in conscience. He was a predator,
completely insensitive.''
   The judge said he was imposing the stiff sentence because it was
``absolutely essential'' to send a message to those who act through
``greed and insatiable lust for despoiling innocent people.''
   The prosecution said Bloom used deceit and fraud to parlay a
college investment club into a multimillion-dollar investment
operation with about 140 clients.
   Bloom, who was not registered as an investment adviser, attracted
investors to his now-defunct Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc. by
falsely claiming his clients included the Sultan of Brunei, the
Rockefeller family and entertainer Bill Cosby.
   Bloom, a 1985 Duke University graduate with an art history
degree, told clients he was putting their money into the stock
market when he actually was using it to pay for his own lavish
lifestyle.
   He had art works worth $5.5 million, an $830,000 condominium on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, a Long Island beach house worth $1.9
million, and two cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible and a
Mercedes-Benz _ worth $200,000.
   Bloom sent his investors bogus account statements that claimed to
show their securities holdings, according to the charges. He also
was charged with using new clients' funds to pay ``profits'' to
older clients.
   Edelstein sentenced Bloom to four years on each count and,
ordered the terms to run consecutively.
   ``He went on his way without any thought of the pain, suffering
and misery he was inflicting,'' said Edelstein. ``He was amoral, not
immoral.''
   The judge said Bloom had ``cannibalized his family and friends.''
He also ordered Bloom to make full restitution.
   No fine was imposed. Edelstein could have sentenced Bloom to 10
years in prison and fined him $20 million.
   In January, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil
charges against Bloom, who settled by agreeing to turn over his
assets to a court-appointed receiver and to stay out of the
securities industry for the rest of his life.
   Bloom neither admitted nor denied the SEC allegations, but
criminal charges were brought in March. He waived indictment and
pleaded guilty March 31 to one count each of mail and securities
fraud.

   A U.S. Army aviation investigations
team arrived in Honduras Friday to look into what caused the crash
of a military helicopter that killed five U.S. servicemen, a U.S.
Embassy spokesman said.
   Embassy spokesman Charles Barclay identified the dead as 1st Lt.
Alan C. Urban, Staff Sgt. John P. McConnell, and Pfcs. Jim D. Bendon
and Douglas J. Kropp, all based at Fort Bragg, N.C.; and Chief
Warrant Officer Randall B. Potter of Fort Stewart, Ga..
   Barclay did not release their hometowns.
   He said rescue workers continued their search for the body of one
of the servicemen, killed Thursday when their CH-47 Chinook
helicopter crashed near the Caribbean port of La Ceiba, 235 miles
north of Tegucigalpa.
   The helicopter was based at Palmerola Air Base, 48 miles north of
Tegucigalpa, the capital. Officials at Palmerola refused comment.
   Barclay said the Chinook had left Palmerola earlier Thursday on a
supply run in joint U.S.-Honduran military maneuvers.
   A team of investigators from the Army Aviation Center in Fort
Rucker, Ala., arrived in Honduras Friday to look into the crash,
Barclay said.
   It was the second fatal crash this year of a twin-rotor Boeing
Chinook. On Feb. 25, an Army Chinook crashed near Chico, Texas,
killing 10 soldiers and seriously burning eight.
   At least 30 American troops in Honduras have been killed or
wounded in accidents or incidents of violence since the United
States began a series of exercises there in 1982.
   About 1,500 American troops are in Honduras, including 1,100
permanently stationed at Palmerola. Others rotate during the year
for training exercises, military construction work and other
projects.

<HEAD>Two-Thirds Of Inmates On Work Release At Non-Traditional Prison Are
Murderers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JESSUP, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two-thirds of the inmates granted work-release
status at the controversial Patuxent Institution are murderers and
nearly 60 percent are serving life terms, according to prison
statistics.
   The Patuxent Institution, which emphasizes rehabilitation through
psychotherapy, came under criticism last week when convicted rapist
James M. Stavarakas fled while on work-release and allegedly raped a
woman in Hyattsville. He was arrested Sunday.
   Earlier, it was revealed that triple killer Robert Daly Angell
was granted several unsupervised furloughs.
   Citing the criticism and Stavarakas' escape, the Patuxent board
of review voted Dec. 1 to suspend all furloughs and work release
programs indefinitely.
   Lifers turn up more often in Patuxent's work-release and leave
programs than do inmates from the prison's general population,
according to the figures released Thursday by the Department of
Public Safety and Correctional Services. While those serving life
sentences represent about one in five Patuxent inmates, they make up
59 percent of those on work-release and 28 percent of those on
leave, the figures showed.
   The figures also showed that inmates serving life terms at
Patuxent serve only half as much time as do lifers at other Maryland
prisons before they are granted parole.
   The 16 Patuxent lifers paroled from July 1, 1977, to June 30,
1988, served an average of 8.4 years before release. Life inmates at
other Maryland prisons are confined 17 years on average before
parole, saidDr. Norma B. Gluckstern, Patuxent's director.
   Patuxent is unusual because of the wide authority given to prison
officials to grant leaves to inmates, although a 1982 law requires
approval by the governor before an inmate serving for life is
paroled.
   Several state lawmakers have suggested that further restrictions
be placed on the prison's governing board.
   Inmates are sent to Patuxent because correction officials
consider them more likely to be rehabilitated through its program of
psychological and psychiatric counseling.

   Officials on Friday tried to determine who
shot down a U.S. locust-spraying plane, and a U.S. team reported
trouble in reaching the wreckage in a remote area used by rebels to
launch attacks.
   The investigators told the U.S. Embassy in Rabat by telephone the
wreckage of the DC-7 lay in the Western Sahara within a 25-mile-wide
strip between Mauritania and the most forward positions along a
2,000-mile defense wall built by Morocco.
   That confirmed earlier U.S. satellite data placing the site in
the heart of an area the Marxist-led Polisario independence movement
in the Western Sahara uses to group its forces. A surface-to-air
missile downed the plane Thursday morning and damaged another plane
that managed to land safely.
   ``At this point, we still don't know who fired the missile,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday. Asked whether
U.S. officials thought it was a terrorist incident, he said, ``Well,
we don't know yet. A lot depends on something we don't know yet,
which is who did it.''
   U.S. military experts said the site was a few miles east of
Daddar Lahlou, a desert outpost halfway between the Mauritanian
border and the defensive wall Morocco erected to guard the most
valuable part of the phosphate-rich territory. The spot is about 650
miles south of Rabat, the capital of this North African country.
   The plane was chartered by the U.S. Agency for International
Development. Reports said it exploded at an altitude of about 10,000
feet and that the five occupants, all Americans, were presumed to be
dead. The wreckage was scattered over a wide area.
   A second DC-7 chartered by AID to help fight the locust plague in
northern Africa also was hit by a missile, but limped 250 miles and
land safely at Sidi Ifni. It sat at the end of the single runway
Friday, and the Sidi Ifni airport was closed.
   Sergio Tommasoni, 64, co-owner of the Chandler, Ariz., aviation
company that owned both planes, was crew chief of the second plane.
He and the other four men aboard were reported safe in Agadir.
   The American investigators were experiencing ``unusual
difficulties'' in reaching the site, U.S. military experts said.
They did not elaborate.
   The Americans aboard the downed plane were identified as Joel
Blackmer, 46, and Blackmer's son, Frank Kennedy, 21, both of
Phoenix; Ben Rossini, 49, Tempe, Ariz.; Frank Hederman, 47, Cody,
Wyo.; and Wes Wilson of North Platte, Neb.
   In Nebraska, Wilson's widow, Linda Wilson, said she talked with
her husband by telephone on Wednesday night and expected him to be
home by Monday.
   ``They knew there were border disputes, but they evidently didn't
think that had anything to do with them,'' she said in an interview
with KKAR Radio of Omaha.
   It was widely assumed, though not confirmed officially, that both
missiles were fired by a guerrilla unit.
   Polisario fighters in the area usually have Soviet-designed SAM
missiles for defense against Moroccan aircraft. Both DC-7s were
flying at 10,000 to 11,000 feet, generally considered too high for
visual identification.
   An American official said privately it was ``at least possible''
the attackers thought the planes were Moroccan.
   In Washington, State Department officials said the FBI has been
brought into the case to investigate who fired the missile at the
planes and why.
   Madjid Abdullah, the Polisario's North American representative,
told The Associated Press in Washington the front ``will do
everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and
unfortunate incident.''
   He said the Polisario Front has no interest in creating an
incident with the United States and declared that Morocco must
assume responsibility for sending civilian planes over an area with
a ``huge concentration'' of Polisario forces.
   The government of King Hassan II of Morocco issued a statement
Friday denouncing what it called ``this act of barbarism.'' It said
the victims were ``shot down coldly while they were fulfilling a
humanitarian duty.''
   Morocco rarely comments on events in the 14-year-old war with
Polisario, but habitually claims its defensive wall runs flush with
the Mauritanian border.
   Tommasoni described the two-hour trip in the crippled plane to
Sidi Ifni as ``hairy.''
   ``We lost altitude. We were 25 to 30 feet above the ground most
of the way,'' he said by telephone from his hotel room in Agadir.
``We had a load of insecticide aboard and we dumped it and were able
to gain some altitude.''
   The planes left Dakar, capital of Senegal, early Thursday morning
for Agadir to join the battle against locusts.
   Morocco annexed the former Spanish Sahara after Spain withdrew in
1975 and Moroccan positions were attacked soon afterward by
Polisario guerrillas based in Algeria. Fighting has continued
despite Morocco's construction of the wall.
   The United Nations plans to organize a referendum among the
80,000 people who lived in the territory under Spanish rule and
their children. The two sides have not agreed, however, on exactly
who should be allowed to vote or a plan for withdrawing Moroccan
forces.

   Federal police and Western
intelligence agencies have broken a spy ring that was supplying NATO
secrets to the Soviet Union, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The Cologne Express newspaper called it ``a huge blow against the
Soviet secret service,'' the KGB.
   Detlev Achammer, spokesman for the West Berlin Justice
Department, confirmed that ``three people are being investigated for
suspicion of espionage.''
   He said one was taken into custody for interrogation on Friday,
and that a warrant is out for another. He refused to elaborate.
   The Cologne newspaper said it learned from security sources that
the ``espionage ring had obtained strictly secret electronics of the
Leopard II tank and important high-tech equipment such as
micro-processors.''
   It said some of the equipment has ``already been sent to the
East.''
   According to the newspaper, Western intelligence agencies, the
West German federal police, and police in West Berlin are involved
in the case.
   The newspaper did not give any further details.
   The Cologne Express sent copies of its report to other news
organizations in advance of Saturday's publication.

<TEXT>
   The owner of the Imperial Palace casino
faces a possible $400,00 fine and loss of his gaming license over
Adolf Hitler birthday celebrations held at the Las Vegas Strip
resort, state officials said Friday.
   The owner, Ralph Engelstad, threw the parties at his casino last
April and April 1986, according to one count of the state Gaming
Control Board complaint.
   The incidents ``have become public knowledge throughout the
United States and in certain foreign countries and reflect or tend
to reflect on the repute of the state of Nevada and act as a
detriment to its gaming industry,'' the complaint said.
   A second count alleges Engelstad destroyed or concealed evidence
relevant to an unrelated civil action stemming from a 1984 rape case
at the Imperial Palace.
   The complaint seeks a fine of up to $400,000 for the alleged
violations, plus the possible revocation, suspension or restriction
of Engelstad's gaming license.
   No date has been set for a state Gaming Commission hearing on the
board's complaint. During the hearing, commission members will act
as judges and control board members will act as prosecutors.
   There was no immediate comment from Engelstad; he would not take
reporters' calls at his casino Friday and no other spokesman was
immediately available.
   In October, Engelstad issued a public apology for the Hitler
parties, saying they were ``not only stupid, but insensitive.''
   The complaint alleges the two Hitler birthday celebrations were
held around April 20, Hitler's birthday. It alleges they featured
cakes decorated with swastikas, Nazi-era German marching music and
German food.
   Bartenders at the parties wore T-shirts bearing a picture of
Hitler and the message ``Adolf Hitler _ European Tour 1939-45,''
according to the complaint.
   The complaint claimed the celebrations were held in the Imperial
Palace's so-called ``War Room,'' which housed Engelstad's collection
of memorabilia from Germany's Third Reich, including a portrait of
himself in a Nazi uniform.
   The complaint also alleges the Imperial Palace's print shop was
used in August 1986 to print 500 bumper stickers stating ``Hitler
Was Right.''

   Twelve-year-old college graduate
Adragon De Mello, who was taken away from his father in September,
will live with his mother on a trial basis beginning this weekend,
representatives of both parents said.
   Adragon, who is believed to be the country's youngest college
graduate, was placed in a foster home after his mother alleged that
the boy and his father had a suicide pact.
   Agustin De Mello, 58, the boy's father, said he will contest the
court's decision. He was arrested in September for investigation of
felony child endangerment although no charges have been filed. He
has denied forming any suicide pact.
   The decision by Santa Cruz County Child Protective Services this
week did not mean that the mother would be given permanent custody,
Robert Bortnick, an investigator who works for the father's
attorney, said Thursday.
   Officials at the agency refused to discuss the case and the boy's
mother, Cathy Gunn, also declined comment. But Gunn's attorney,
Patricia Vorreiter, said Thursday that the boy will move to his
mother's Santa Clara County home on Saturday.
   Adragon graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz
in June, when he was 11. He earned a degree in mathematics.

<HEAD>Soviet Scientists Competing For Use of Controversial Radar,
Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet scientists are competing with each other
to develop a research project for the scientific use of a
controversial military radar, the president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences said Friday.
   Guriy Marchuk, who leads the Soviet academy, said that at least
four scientific uses for the large radar station at Krasnoyarsk have
been proposed to the academy, but no final decision has been made.
   The radar, located in a remote sector of central Siberia, was
turned over to the Soviet academy by Soviet president Mikhail S.
Gorbachev after the Reagan administration claimed that it was a
violation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty between the U.S. and
the Soviet Union.
   The radar is neither on the edge of the Soviet Union nor is it
pointed outward, as is required by the ABM treaty. It is believed by
U.S. experts that the radar was built for the detection and tracking
of ballistic missiles.
   Marchuk, who lectured Friday at the National Academy of Sciences,
was asked what the Soviet academy planned to do with the radar.
   ``We don't know,'' Marchuk replied through an interpreter. ``We
have declared a competition or contest'' to find the best use for
the radar station.
   ``We have at least four projects suggesting what we should do
with it,'' he added. He said the proposals include both space and
atmospheric research.
   Marchuk, speaking to an audience of American researchers, said
that scientists everywhere may participate in the competition.
   ``I invite all of those with ideas to come up with proposals and
send them to us,'' he said.
   In his lecture, Marchuk said the Soviet Union now is applying
democratic principles in selecting the scientific leadership of the
nation.
   He said there are about 520 academic institutions in the USSR and
that they all recently selected new leaders on a ``competitive
basis.''
   ``More than half of the academic institutions now are headed by
young people,'' said Marchuk. ``This is possible only in the
atmosphere of democracy.''
   The academy president said he regarded this as a good development
for Soviet science because ``the best ideas come into the minds of
people under the age of 30. After 30 they just develop their ideas.''
   Marchuk gave the lecture on the opening day of a conference
marking the 30th year of cooperatation and exchange between the
National Academy of Sciences of the United States, and the Academy
of Sciences of the USSR.

<HEAD>Federal Bank Board Commits $1 Billion to Close Denver S&L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal savings and loan regulators on Friday
pledged $1.05 billion to shut down an insolvent Denver institution
in one of the nation's biggest S&L failures.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates federally
insured S&Ls, created a new institution to receive $1.7 billion in
deposits of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association,
which was ordered closed by Colorado regulators.
   After the failed institution's assets are liquidated, federal
regulators expect to have spent slightly more than $1 billion.
Silverado joins only a handful of financial institutions that have
cost government insurance funds that much to close or rescue.
   In the largest-ever clean-up of a single insolvent S&L _ the
pending rescue of American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton,
Calif. _ the bank board estimates it will spend $2 billion.
   In the case of Silverado, the bank board's insurance fund, the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., is pumping $200 million in
cash to the new, government-owned institution, Mile High Federal
Savings and Loan Association, and pledging another $624 million in a
promissory note.
   Starting Monday, all Silverado depositors with accounts under the
insurance limit of $100,000 will be able to deposit and withdraw
money as usual at the new Mile High.
   The bank board is hiring First Nationwide Bank of San Francisco
to manage Mile High. It appointed a five-member board of directors,
headed by Donald F. Roby of Nevada, Mo., president of Farm Home
Savings Association.
   The current stockholders and manager won't benefit from the
transaction, the bank board said. The institution's president, W.
James Metz, controlled about 90 percent of the stock.
   The bank board attributed the failure to ``substantial
dissipation of assets due to alleged violations of laws, rules and
regulations.'' It said Silverado had swapped some of its preferred
stock for undeveloped land owned by developers.
   Regulators said Silverado was losing money on many of its loans
and that much of its investments were direct interests in risky
commercial real estate ventures, rather than in the traditional S&L
business of home mortgage lending.
   The bank board has closed, merged or otherwise ``resolved'' the
cases of 148 insolvent S&Ls so far this year, a post-Depression
record, spending or pledging to spend about $23 billion. M. Danny
Wall, bank board chairman, said last week that he hoped to have
resolved 200 cases by the end of the year.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Friday
gave preliminary approval to a program to bail out Tracy Collins
Bank and Trust Company of Salt Lake City. Under the program Tracy
will merge with the Continental Bank and Trust Co. in Salt Lake to
create a bank with total assets of approximately $600 million.
   In a separate action, the FDIC also allowed Citicorp Holdings,
Inc. of New York to purchase Caribank, Dania as a national bank
subsidiary. The FDIC had been named receiver for Caribank when
Florida's comptroller closed it Friday.
   About 400 of 3,000 S&Ls are insolvent and estimates of the cost
of the total clean-up range up to $100 billion. The Treasury
Department is working on a plan for President-elect Bush aimed at
directing more money to the resolutions without adding substantially
to the federal budget deficit.

   Bad weather and technical glitches
forced a delay of at least 24 hours in the launch of an Ariane 4
rocket carrying satellites for direct television broadcasts and
British military signals.
   The countdown at the space center on the Atlantic coast of French
Guiana was halted just six minutes before the planned liftoff at
9:01 p.m. (7:01 p.m. EST) to let a threatening storm cloud pass by.
   It was resumed 20 minutes later, only to be stopped automatically
when there was a failure in the computerized link with the tracking
station on Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean, Arianespace
President Frederic d'Allest said.
   He said the liftoff was postponed until the second planned launch
window, from 10:23 p.m. to 11:40 p.m. (8:23 p.m. EST to 9:40 p.m.
EST).
   But just as the second launch window was opening, d'Allest said
the failure of a remote sensor on the rocket's third stage would
force a delay until Saturday night or Sunday.
   A decision was expected Saturday morning on when to reschedule
the launch.
   It is the first commercial mission for the Ariane 4, a more
powerful and more versatile version of previous Ariane rockets,
developed by the European Space Agency, a 13-member consortium led
by France.
   In June, the Ariane 4 put three satellites into orbit in a
successful demonstration launch.
   Luxembourg's Astra 1A satellite has the potential to change the
viewing habits of millions of Western Europeans, as receiving dishes
sprout on roofs and in back yards.
   Beginning in late January, it will be able to beam 16 channels of
programming to an area that includes 85 percent of West European
homes.
   The European Satellite Company, a Luxembourg-based consortium,
announced the sale of the 11th channel Friday to the Swedish company
Esselte, which plans a pay-TV film service called Filmnet.
   Other channels already sold will offer sports, news and movies.
   A competing direct-broadcast satellite, France's TDF-1, was
launched by Ariane last month, but it has not yet lined up
programming for its six channels.
   Britain's Skynet 4B, the other satellite being launched, is to
provide communications for submarines and surface vessels of the
British navy and ground stations.
   Arianespace, the company set up to handle commercial launches of
the Ariane rockets, had six previous launches in 1988, all
successful.

   Palestinian guerrillas battled Israeli
air, naval and commando forces for nine hours Friday in Israel's
deepest raid into Lebanon in five years. An Israeli officer and at
least eight guerrillas were killed.
   Three Israeli soldiers and at least 16 guerrillas were wounded in
the battle across hills overlooking this coastal town, 50 miles
north of the Israeli border and nine miles south of Beirut, Lebanese
police and Israeli army spokesmen said.
   Israel said at least 20 guerrillas were killed and dozens
wounded. Lebanese police said at least eight were killed.
   The operation ended when four Israeli troops who had been
separated from the main force and surrounded by guerrillas were
plucked from the ground by two Cobra gunships and carried away
clinging to the struts, an Israeli officer said. A similar rescue in
1986 saved the life of a downed Israeli pilot.
   In Israel, army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said Israel
launched the raid against the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a pro-Syrian group headed by Ahmed
Jibril, to deter further attacks against Israel.
   ``He (Jibril) prepares incidents all the time, and we saw a great
need to attack his camp from where a great many incidents of this
organization are planned and organized against us,'' Shomron told a
news conference.
   Israeli officials declined to say how many troops participated in
the raid, which began with a landing on bluffs east of Naameh at
around midnight.
   An Israeli army spokesman said the troops maneuvered across one
to two miles of rough terrain on foot to the nearby guerrilla base,
then penetrated it without being detected and fought hand-to-hand
before withdrawing.
   The Israeli officer was killed during the assault on the camp,
the spokesman said. An army communique identified him as Lt. Col.
Amir Meital, 29, a commander of the elite Golani Brigade.
   In Lebanon, a police spokesman said the Israeli unit was ambushed
and surrounded shortly after landing. He said the Israelis responded
by dispatching commandos by sea, and its warplanes mounted 20
sorties.
   The hostilities were over by 11:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. EST), shortly
after two Israeli helicopters landed near an abandoned Maronite
monastery and evacuated the besieged troops, the spokesman said.
   The operation marked Israel's deepest penetration into Lebanon
since it withdrew from the Chouf mountains southeast of Beirut in
September 1983, about a year after invading Lebanon in 1982. Israel
withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon in 1985.
   Initial communiques released by Jibril's group claimed 18
Israelis were captured. But later, Jibril acknowledged there were no
captives, saying: ``The Israeli army has managed even to evacuate
the body of the killed officer as well as the three wounded
soldiers.''
   Sitting at an impromptu news conference in a tunnel in the
stricken area, Jibril displayed a U.S.-made M-16 rifle and
binoculars he said belonged to the dead Israeli officer.
   An aide to Jibril, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Israelis had released several Doberman pinscher dogs fitted with
tear-gas containers and explosives.
   ``The dogs were trained to chase our fighters in the tunnels,
when the Israelis would release the gas by remote control or
detonate the explosives to either force our fighters to leave the
tunnels or kill them,'' he said.
   ``Our fighters shot the dogs,'' he said, pointing to a dead black
Doberman with explosives and a gas container strapped around his
belly.
   The police spokesman said guerrillas and allied leftist
militiamen opened fire at the Israeli jets and helicopter gunships
from twin-barrelled anti-aircraft guns and launched several
shoulder-fired Sam-7 missiles. No hits were reported, he said.
   Syrian soldiers in trucks and armored personnel carriers were
seen rolling south on the coastal highway when Israeli
reinforcements stormed ashore at Saadiyat, two miles south of
Naameh, the spokesman said. But he said there was no evidence of any
Syrian-Israeli combat.
   Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in Beirut as the
planes thundered through the blue Mediterranean sky to stage
Israel's 24th air raid on Lebanon this year.
   At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in 23 previous
Israeli air raids on Lebanon since Jan. 3.
   Black smoke and the stench of explosives shrouded Naameh and its
bluffs as the hostilities raged, and panicked residents deserted the
town for safer areas in Beirut and south Lebanon.
   Many cars sped out, horns honking, from the stricken bluffs to
the coastal highway.
   Lebanon's U.N. ambassador on Friday called for a Security Council
meeting on Israel's raid. Ambassador M. Rachid Fakhoury made the
request in a letter to the Security Council.
   There was no immediate response from U.N. officials.

<HEAD>Rocard's Government Survives First Censure Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard's minority
government survived its first National Assembly censure vote early
Saturday when Communist members refused to back the conservative
opposition.
   Only 258 legislators, all members of rightist or center-right
parties, voted for the censure motion.
   Under the French Constitution, the government is forced to resign
on a censure motion only if an absolute majority _ 286 out of 571 _
votes for it, not just a majority of those voting.
   Only votes in favor are recorded. There are no abstentions or
votes against. Six seats are vacant in the 577-member chamber of
deputies, the lower house.
   Rocard has been widely criticized for his handling of a series of
strikes by public employees, including one that has disrupted
subway, bus and suburban train service for the past two weeks. But
he was in no danger of losing the censure vote.
   ``France is at an impasse,'' Philippe Seguin, speaking for the
conservative Rally for the Republic party, said in the censure
debate. ``A country needs to be led, to know where it's going, how
it's getting there and why it's going there.''
   Rocard told the National Assembly it was a ``motion of spite''
presented because the right was ``embitterred by its defeat'' in
this year's presidential and legislative elections.
   He called the motion ``an operation of political diversion, with
its result known in advance and with no effect on the political or
social climate.''
   The debate began Friday night and lasted past midnight.
   The current chamber of deputies is made up of 273 Socialists, 130
members of the Rally for the Republic, 89 from the center-right
Union for French Democracy, 41 in the Union of the Center, 24
Communists and 14 independents.
   President Francois Mitterrand named Rocard premier last May after
winning re-election to a new seven-year term. In June's legislative
elections, the Socialists fell short of winning a majority in the
chamber, but did well enough to prevent the right from taking
control.

   A massive worldwide outpouring of sympathy brought
London firefighters, French search dogs, tons of tents, and blankets
and medicine to the Soviet Union on Friday to help relief for the
Armenian earthquake.
   More dogs and medical supplies were expected to be en route soon,
courtesy of the U.S. government.
   Western countries, the Soviet Union's East bloc allies and even
groups not recognized by the Kremlin pledged millions of dollars of
aid in a relief effort that crossed political boundaries and cut
quickly through Soviet red tape.
   ``We are awaiting more planes from foreign countries. We badly
need them and are grateful for what they are bringing us,'' said
Robert Gastoryan, an assistant to the director of the Yerevan's
Zvarnots airport.
   About 80,000 people were killed in Tuesday's earthquake, Leonid
Zamyatin, the Soviet ambassador to Britain, said in London. Hundreds
of thousands were left homeless.
   The Soviet reaction to the outpouring of help astonished some
observers.
   ``It's unusual for the Soviet Union to accept assistance from
foreign countries, especially the West, but this is a really unusual
situation and we're doing the best we can to help out and coordinate
our efforts,'' a Western European diplomat said on condition of
anonymity.
   In Washington, U.S. and Soviet officials announced Friday that
the U.S. government would charter an airplane to carry medical
supplies and dog search teams to help. The U.S. government extended
an offer of help Thursday.
   Cindy Stuart, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Agency for International
Aid Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, said officials were
looking for a plane and assembling teams and goods but that no
details of the trip were laid out yet.
   The Soviet Red Cross said its most pressing needs are
antibiotics, syringes and needles, blood collection containers,
blood substitutes, surgical thread and food concentrates.
   The League of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Geneva
said at least 12 planeloads of emergency supplies from International
Red Cross societies worldwide were expected to arrive in Moscow and
Yerevan between Friday night and Saturday afternoon.
   The flights are leaving from Norway, Sweden, Hungary, West
Germany, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Bulgaria, Britain and Belgium, it
said.
   In addition, societies from the United States, Austria, Canada,
Greece, Iceland, Japan and Switzerland have announced aid, and ``at
least another 20 national societies are actively fund-raising and
are expected to announce donations shortly,'' it said.
   A French team of 180 people, including 22 doctors and 19 rescue
teams, brought the first foreign relief workers to Armenia. The
group brought 12 search dogs and 20 tons of medical supplies.
   ``We are very touched to be here and glad that we will be able to
help out in Armenia,'' one of the French relief officers said on
television.
   The dogs are trained to sniff out people buried under rubble.
Soviet television showed rescuers poking through the rubble with
metal poles trying to detect signs of life.
   Television also showed the arrival of a Swiss plane with more
dogs and disaster experts.
   A special firefighting unit from London led by Home Office Fire
Inspector Norman Roundell arrived in Moscow late Friday. A Soviet
television report from London showed the firefighters holding up
special heat-sensitive cameras to detect live victims under the
rubble.
   The four-man team previously participated in quake search efforts
in Mexico and El Salvador.
   The British government also pledged $9.3 million.
   Italy sent medical aid and telecommunications equipment, the
International Red Cross dispatched four-wheel drive vehicles, and
Britain said a Royal Air Force transport plane was standing by to
send earth-moving equipment.
   The American Red Cross collected money, antibiotics and supplies,
and the Soviet Embassy in Washington said it has been overwhemed
with donations and has set up a bank account for those wishing to
help.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
administration is willing to do whatever it can to help deliver aid
and materials collected through private means. But he said the
administration probably would not send U.S. government money to the
Soviets.
   Americans of Armenian descent gathered in shops and churches
around the United States to seek news on the quake and donate money
and supplies.
   In Watertown, Mass., Ara Kalaydjian, editor of the Armenian
Mirror Spectator, said despair has ``changed into determination to
build again and not for decades _ for centuries.''
   Organizations such as the Polish banned trade union Solidarity
and Israel's national Red Cross society, neither of which is
recognized by the Soviet Union, said they were ready to help.
   ``Let's remember, Solidarity means also solidarity with other
nations and with those who especially need such Solidarity,'' said
an appeal signed by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   Walesa urged Solidarity members to contribute to a Roman Catholic
Church fund for Armenia, and the union's health service commission
said it was ready to send medicine and a team of doctors and nurses.
   The Polish government pledged tents, sleeping bags, bandages and
medicine and state-controlled television read a list of factories
donating money.
   S.O.S. Childrens' Home, an Austrian organization, offered to
construct a provisional orphanage for children who lost their
parents in the quake.
   India said it was sending a 42-member medical team with medicine,
blankets and other relief supplies.

Case</HEAD>

   A state public service commissioner and a
former commissioner pleaded innocent Friday to federal bribery and
conspiracy charges stemming from an alleged scheme to pressure a
utility into settling a more than $400 million lawsuit.
   Public Service Commissioner D.W. Snyder, former Commissioner Lynn
Havens and two businessmen were each released on $5,000 bond after
entering innocent pleas before before U.S. Magistrate John R.
Countiss III. He set the trial for March 6.
   The 19-count federal grand jury indictment was made public
Thursday.
   Charged with one count each of conspiracy are Snyder, 73, one of
the three state public service commissioners since 1964; Havens, 52,
a former commissioner who resigned Jan. 11 amid rumors he was under
investigation by the FBI; Travis Ward, 68, a Dallas oil tycoon whose
current business interests include the Nautilus exercise equipment
company; and Thurston Little, 54, a Corinth businessman.
   ``I don't like people stealing my headlines,'' quipped Little, an
unsuccessful 1987 candidate for highway commissioner, as he joined
the other three defendants in a packed courtroom.
   ``I thought wouldn't it be good if we could have brought
Gorbachev into Jackson this week,'' Havens joked.
   In addition to the conspiracy count, Ward was charged with 13
counts of travel in interstate commerce to bribe public officials;
and Havens and Snyder each were charged with three counts of
accepting bribes.
   Havens is accused of taking the proceeds from a $50,000 loan
co-signed by Ward, while Snyder is accused of taking $16,000 in
cash. Havens contends he did nothing illegal because he repaid Ward.
Snyder says he never received the $16,000. Little is accused of
acting as an intermediary for Ward in the scheme.
   The charges stem from an alleged plan to have the public service
commissioners tell Mississippi Power & Light Co. officials they
wouldn't approve a 14.7 percent rate hike to pay for the utlity's
portion of the Grand Gulf nuclear power plant in Port Gibson unless
MP&L agreed to an out-of-court settlement in its breach of contract
lawsuit against United Gas Pipeline of Houston.
   On Sept. 20, 1985, the three-member Public Service Commission
approved a settlement of the utility's lawsuit against the pipeline
company that totaled $165 million, or less than half the $400
million the utility had originally sought.
   Ward was retained to help settle the lawsuit, said James Tramuto,
United Gas Pipeline's vice president for government affairs. But
Tramuto said the company has changed hands several times since 1985,
and the current ownership and management knows nothing about the
alleged conspiracy.
   Nielsen Cochran, the third public service commissioner, wasn't
indicted.

   Americans are responding to the earthquake in Armenia with offers
of medical supplies, doctors, money, specially trained dogs and
prayers.
   As Soviet officials reported 80,000 people died in the disaster
Wednesday in northwestern Armenia, the American Red Cross collected
money, antibiotics and supplies and groups throughout the United
States began efforts to help the survivors.
   Rhode Island's Gov. Edward DiPrete offered to send his state's
National Guard to Armenia if President Reagan approves. ``It's just
a willingness to help in whatever way possible,'' DiPrete said.
   The Chicago chapter of the Armenian General Benevolent Union,
began accepting relief donations, including two or more ambulances
for the disaster area, said the group's treasurer, Peter Klujian.
   The ambulance contributor, who lives in Florida, ``sent the money
to the manufacturer in East Germany and is having them sent directly
to the earthquake area,'' Klujian said.
   In Washington, an Armenian Diocese Earthquake Fund was set up at
St. Mary's Armenian Church. During a memorial service, its pastor,
the Rev. V. Kalayjian, described the devastation as ``the disaster
that fell on us like a bomb.''
   Boston-based Oxfam America donated $20,000 for temporary shelter
and medical supplies, its first relief effort in an industrialized
nation and in the Soviet Union, officials said.
   Members of the U.S. Disaster Dog Search and Rescue Team headed to
New York and planned to go to Armenia to aid in search efforts,
officials said Friday.
   Team members from Northeast Search and Rescue, New Jersey, and
Dogs East, Virginia, were summoned from their homes across the East
Coast and gathered at JFK International Airport in New York on
Friday.
   Eight dogs, their handlers, equipment and a two-week supply of
dog food were to be flown to the Soviet Union aboard a jet flight
arranged by the State Department, said Judi Kroeger, a spokeswoman
for Allentown, Pa.-based Alpo Petfoods Inc., which sponsors the
units.
   Specific flight times had not been set, but the jet was to fly
first to Washington, D.C.'s Dulles Airport and leave for the Soviet
Union at 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday, said a worker in the U.S. Agency
for International Aid's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, who
asked not to be identified.
   In California, Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian called an emergency
meeting of the largest Armenian community outside the Soviet Union
to raise money and medical supplies for ``our stricken families and
friends in Armenia.''
   Hovsepian, leader of the Armenian Apostolic Church's Western
Diocese, also declared a 40 days' mourning for quake victims.
   In Los Angeles, KSCI-TV scheduled a fund-raising telethon between
midnight Saturday and 6 a.m. Sunday, to be broadcast in English and
Armenian throughout Southern California and in Armenian communities
nationwide, officials said.
   Occidental Petroleum chairman Armand Hammer delivered a message
from his Los Angeles headquarters to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, D.C., promising the use of a private jet to fly supplies
to the region.
   In Alaska, Gov. Steve Cowper also has offered to send the Soviet
Union teams of trained dogs and searchers to help find survivors
trapped in the earthquake rubble.
   ``The state of Alaska has a history of similar natural disasters.
As a result, we have developed considerable expertise in contending
with the problems associated with earthquakes, avalanches and other
natural catastrophes,'' Cowper said in a letter to Soviet officials
in Washington.
   In Seattle, the Armenian Church of Seattle and the Armenian
Clutural Association here are collecting food, clothing and supplies
for victims of the quake.
   In Oregon, the Portland-based Northwest Medical Teams was
appealing to the public for donations, medical supplies and
volunteers for a possible relief mission to Armenia.
   Ron Post, Northwest Medical Teams president, said he hopes 25
people will go on the mission. The team would include orthopedic
surgeons, neurosurgeons, scrub nurses, orthopedic and
neuro-technicians, an anesthesiologist and support personnel.
   While the U.S. State Department helped the group in its effort to
obtain visas, the organization also began contacting airlines
Thursday to help transport the team and an estimated 80,000 pounds
of medical equipment. The cost of the operation is estimated to be
$250,000, Post said.
   Armenians in Wisconsin banded together with prayers and donations
to help victims of the earthquake that ravaged their homeland.
   The Rev. Tateos Abdalian, pastor at the St. John the Baptist
Armenian Apostolic Church in Greenfield, Wis., said hundreds of
people called with donations of money, clothing and other items. The
church is planning clothing, blood and blanket drives.
   In Cleveland, the 100-member St. Gregory of Narek Armenian Church
said it would accept donations for earthquake victims.
   The Soviet Embassy in Washington said it has been overwhelmed
with telephone calls and by people who are ``walking up to the doors
of the embassy with checks and money orders.''
   New Jersey residents also have opened their hearts and their
pocketbooks to the earthquake victims.
   ``Americans, Armenians, non-Armenians _ the American people are
very generously cooperating with funds,'' said Sonig Vayejian,
associate director of the New Jersey chapter of the Armenian General
Benevolent Union.
   She said the group has 10 phone lines operating 24 hours a day
and was installing an additional five to handle the crush.
   The Rev. Karl Vartan Avakiar of the Armenian Presbyterian Church
in Paramus, N.J., said at least 12 doctors from Hudson and Bergen
counties and several nurses were ready to fly to Armenia with
medical supplies and bedding as soon as they got permission from the
Soviet government.
   The New Jersey Council of Churches, which represents 3,000
churches statewide from 16 denominations, issued an emergency appeal
to its members to take up special collections Sunday for the
earthquake victims.
   ``This is one of the world's most disastrous earthquakes,'' said
the council's executive director, the Rev. Charles W. Rawlings.
``Our brothers and sisters in Armenia are suffering again on a scale
we Americans can barely imagine. They need our help.''
   In Columbus, Ohio, Cincinnati Insurance Cos.' chief executive and
the state insurance director announced a fund-raising drive to raise
at least $500,000 for medical aid to quake victims.
   CEO John Schiff said he would contact the heads of all 283
Ohio-chartered insurance companies to ask for donations, an idea
proposed by state Insurance Director George Fabe.

   Former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos was
hospitalized Friday after suffering what apparently was congestive
heart failure, spokesmen said.
   Marcos, 71, was taken by ambulance to St. Francis Hospital. He
was admitted upon the recommendation of his physician, Calvin Wong,
because of ``the acute onset of congestive heart failure'' Friday
morning, spokesman Gemmo Trinidad said.
   Marcos was in guarded condition Friday afternoon and was expected
to be in the hospital for a couple of days, said St. Francis
Hospital spokeswoman Norma Kop.
   Preliminary findings indicated Marcos had indeed suffered
congestive heart failure and an arrhythmia, or irregularity in the
heartbeat, she said.
   Asked to comment on allegations that Marcos, who was deposed as
Philippine president in 1986 and is now under indictment in the
United States, had earlier faked symptoms of illness, Kop replied:
``He had a heart irregularity, and that can be pretty serious.''
   He was resting comfortably with his wife, Imelda, nearby, and he
was able to eat and was in good spirits, she said.
   Marcos was given chest X-rays, an EKG and diagnostic tests, but
the results would not be available until Saturday, she said.
   Wong said Marcos did not have a heart attack. Congestive heart
failure means the heart is unable to pump the amount of blood
required by the body.
   ``Mrs. Marcos is very worried,'' Trinidad said. ``She's in tears;
she's always in tears.''
   Marcos began having chest pains around 4 a.m., after learning
that his pregnant daughter, Imee Manotoc, who lives in exile in
Morocco, was having medical problems and would have to deliver by
Caesarian section, Trinidad said.
   Monotoc gave birth but her condition and that of the baby was not
known, Trinidad said. ``The president became so worried, sick and
upset that they called the doctor,'' Trinidad said.
   After Marcos was examined by doctors at his Makiki Heights home,
it was decided he should be hospitalized, Trinidad said. Marcos
arrived at the hospital shortly after noon, and was admitted after
being examined in the hospital's emergency room.
   Marcos spent several days at the hospital in May after suffering
chest pains.
   Marcos has been monitored for three weeks because of an irregular
heartbeat due to heart disease, Trinidad said. Wong ordered complete
bed rest, and Marcos will not be permitted to walk around at the
hospital, Trinidad said.
   A New York cardiologist has told a federal judge in New York that
although Marcos suffers various health problems, he is well enough
to travel to New York for arraignment on racketeering charges. The
arraignment had been postponed after Marcos' doctors said he was not
well enough to travel.
   Marcos faked pain and other ailments during the three-hour
examination, according to the report by the cardiologist, Francis M.
Weld.
   Weld said he, Wong and other Marcos physicians with whom he
consulted are unable to account for Marcos' escalating and
widespread pain syndrome, and say that that should not stop him from
traveling or appearing in court.
   Marcos has lived in Hawaii since he was ousted in February 1986.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived home today
to command a nationwide relief effort in the southern republic of
Armenia, where a major earthquake killed tens of thousands of
people, leveled buildings and destroyed bridges and roads.
   A Soviet scientist predicted more tremors in the devastated
region where 3.3 million people reside. Workers scrambled to find
survivors buried in the rubble.
   ``Thousands of people are standing in line to give blood,'' said
Leon Azruyan, an editor at the official Armenpress news agency in
the Armenian capital, Yerevan. ``They understand that during a
natural disaster, you can't just wring your hands. You have to
help.''

   President Reagan, in a twilight assessment,
says Mikhail S. Gorbachev has never shown any reason to be
mistrusted and in fact is steering the Kremlin away from its old
goal of ``a one-world communist state.''
   In what was probably his final White House news conference,
Reagan said ``trust but verify'' remains his byword in dealing with
the Russians, but he offered an optimstic assessment of how
U.S.-Soviet relations stand at the end of his eight-year tenure in
office.
   ``The path remains open and the pace of peace continues,'' he
said. He said it was the Russians _ not he _ who have changed, but
his old anti-communist fire was dampened.

   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and other NATO foreign

has been dominated by the unveiling of a joint position for
negotiations due to begin next year in Vienna, Austria.
   ``This will not be an easy negotiation,'' said a senior U.S.

   Mikhail Gorbachev's visit and a glitzy Soviet
trade show may look like part of a new push for business with the
West, but in fact the communist superpower has been dabbling in
overseas ventures for decades.
   Soviet businesses abroad already include service stations in
Scandinavia, tractor dealerships and fish canneries in the United
States and Canada, and currency speculators in London and Paris.
   ``I would say this sort of trend will continue, and under
Gorbachev it will be more dynamic,'' said Carl McMillan, a Soviet
expert at Carleton University in Ottawa. ``I don't think `The
Russians Are Coming' thing really fits. They've been around for
awhile.'' Even so, the number of foreign firms the Soviets own
wholly or partly has jumped from about a dozen in the early 1960s to
more than 120 now, McMillan said.

   A massive worldwide outpouring of sympathy brought
London firefighters, French search dogs, tons of tents and blankets
and medicine to the Soviet Union on Friday to help in the Armenian
earthquake.
   Western countries, the Soviet Union's East bloc allies and even
groups not recognized by the Kremlin pledged millions of dollars of
aid in a relief effort that crossed political boundaries and cut
quickly through Soviet red tape.
   ``We are awaiting more planes from foreign countries. We badly
need them and are grateful for what they are bringing us,'' said
Robert Gastoryan, an assistant to the director of the Yerevan's
Zvarnots airport.
   About 80,000 people were killed in Tuesday's earthquake, Leonid

   A blowtorch of dry Santa Ana wind and blazing
embers destroyed or damaged 22 expensive homes early Friday when a
roaring 3000-acre brush fire chased residents from their beds in a
third day of destruction.
   Police asked residents to evacuate threatened areas where many
houses have fashionable but flammable wooden shingles, but officials
did not know how many left. Schools were closed and evacuation
centers were set up at campuses and a synagogue. No serious injuries
were reported.
   The firestorm, driven by erratic gusts of up to 70 mph blasting
off the desert, hit the northwestern San Fernando Valley, adding new
destruction to the 22 homes lost and many others damaged Wednesday
and Thursday, when the wind toppled trucks and knocked out power to
half a million customers.
   Ten homes were destroyed Friday and 12 were damaged when the fire
raced from Sunshine Canyon through the Santa Susana Mountains 25
miles northwest of downtown and down into the fashionable Porter
Ranch development, said county fire spokesman John Lenihan.

   NATO should be cautious about Soviet proposals
for deep reductions in European troop levels because Krelim leaders
believe they still could win a war with fewer soldiers than they
have now, a congressional study said Friday.
   The report by a trio of congressional agencies was completed
before the announcement of troop reductions made Wednesday by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev, in a United Nations speech, said the Soviet Union
would reduce its military forces 10 percent worldwide. That would
include the withdrawal of some Soviet troops and tanks from Eastern
Europe.
   Friday's report was prepared by the General Accounting Office,
the Office of Technology Assessment and the Congressional Research
Service. It was done in response to last year's Pentagon budget
bill, which ordered a wide-ranging study of the military balance
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union
and its Warsaw Pact allies.

<HEAD>Handel & Haydn Society Revives Its Avant-Garde Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a group of ordinary Boston merchants who liked
to sing formed the Handel & Haydn Society in 1815, Beethoven was hot
and Mozart was trendy.
   Decades passed. The amateur chorus grew musically musty. But
since Christopher Hogwood, a world-renowned British expert in early
music, took over as artistic director in 1986, the country's oldest
performing arts group has returned to its avant-garde origins.
   He has breathed new life into Handel's ``Messiah'' by scraping
off nearly 200 years of bigger-is-better interpretation, using
period instruments and following the composer's instructions.
   Last year, Hogwood mixed jazz pianist Keith Jarrett with Mozart
and Prokofiev to demonstrate unexpected connections. And he would
like to collaborate with such unorthodox musicians as the Talking
Heads, a rock band with an intellectual bent.
   ``I'm interested in doing some extraordinary combinations, the
sort of program that really makes the audience think,'' he said
during a recent interview.
   Hogwood is just as faithful to the society's baroque and
classical heritage, the music that attracted this 47-year-old
scholar, harpsichordist, author and conductor in the first place.
   After all, this was the group that performed the U.S. premieres
of Haydn's ``The Creation'' (1817), Handel's complete ``Messiah''
(1818), Verdi's ``Requiem'' (1878) and Bach's ``B Minor Mass''
(1887).
   Those were the H&H heydays. Some time around the turn of the
century the Handel & Haydn Society got stuck in the past. That's
when it stopped sending 600-singer choruses to New York City by
boat. It's reputation shriveled until it was known as little more
than a Boston chorus that sang ``Messiah'' at Christmas.
   This began to change in the late 1960s when conductor Thomas Dunn
trimmed from hundreds of amateurs to a few dozen professional
singers and added a small professional orchestra.
   Then Hogwood arrived.
   The Cambridge University musicologist, harpsichoridist, scholar,
author and conductor already was established as the sort of musician
who would have suited the H&H founders. In 1973, for example, he
founded the Academy of Ancient Music, the first British orchestra to
use instruments authentic to the baroque and classical music it
performed.
   Hogwood, 47, holds to the paradoxical philosophy that what is old
can be new. That's why he favors instruments and arrangements
authentic to the composer who wrote the work.
   As he phrased it: ``Should we put the hands back on Venus de Milo?
   ``My feeling is toward locating what speaks to every man. If you
take on the right instruments, that music will speak more natural
language.''
   Hogwood's deft mix of old and new touches everything. This month
H&H marked the 135th annual Boston performance of Handel's
``Messiah,'' but performed for the first time on period instruments.
   Also during December, H&H performs at Lincoln Center, its first
return to New York since the last century. The society is also
taking ``Messiah'' to Chicago's Orchestra Hall for a debut.
   And the group has its first recording contract.
   ``It is a society, so it's more than just concerts, ... we talk
to our audience. The H&H demands that we be at the cutting edge,''
Hogwood said.
   Thus, when the improvisational Jarrett performed, he played
Mozart, who was himself a famed improviser. That concert also
included Prokofiev, the neoclassical modern Russian composer who
looked to Mozart for inspiration. The program illustrated the
musical threads.
   The public seems to like this approach, too. Its subscription
list is multiplying.
   It has operated in the black the past four years, and the 1989
budget is $1.3 million for its September to April season. That's
triple the 1984 budget.
   Hogwood juggles his time and place between England (where he
makes his home and runs the Academy of Ancient Music), Minnesota
(where he is director of music for the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra)
and Sydney, where he is artistic adviser to the Australian Chamber
Orchestra.
   Since taking over as music director in 1986, he is quickly moving
H&H out into that world, showing it is alive and well and living up
to the tradition of its founders.
   Hogwood's goal, he said, ``is to get what we are doing more
defined and get it outside the confines of Boston.''

   Last summer, Beverly D'Angelo was grand marshal
of the July 4 parade in her native Columbus, Ohio. In the new Peter
O'Toole movie ``High Spirits,'' D'Angelo doesn't do much cheering.
   She plays the unhappy wife of Steve Guttenberg, an American
tourist who hopes to rejuvenate his marriage by taking a trip to
Ireland. They end up at Castle Plunkett, run by Peter Plunkett
(O'Toole), who attracts customers by advertising that the castle is
haunted. Unloved by his cold-hearted wife, Guttenberg ends up
falling in love with a beautiful ghost (Daryl Hannah).
   ``I decided I was going to be free from what was expected of
me,'' said D'Angelo about her new role. She has appeared in ``Coal
Miner's Daughter'' with Sissy Spacek and ``National Lampoon's
Vacation'' with Chevy Chase, among many other films.
   ``After the `Vacation' movies, there was tremendous popularity
and success,'' she said. ``I got photographed at a lot of airports.
But if you're really established so firmly in other people's
imagination, it's difficult to get out a certain range.''
   So the actress jumped at the chance to play a negative character
in ``High Spirits.''
   ``I was totally relieved of having to try to make anyone like me.
I could really explore a territory without worrying about it,''
D'Angelo said.
   The actress was born in 1954 and lived in Columbus until
graduating from high school. Painting was her first love, and she
lived in Florence, Italy, where she studied at the American School
of Contemporary Arts. But her dream of being an artist was
short-lived and when she returned to the United States, D'Angelo,
whose father was a musician, pursued a career as a singer.
   ``I had a musical background and I ended up in Toronto doing
studio vocals. I did anything. Pepsodent commercials. I sang in a
few bands, I sang in bowling alleys. ''
   She landed a job as a background singer for the rock artist
Ronnie Hawkins, but her interests soon shifted to acting and she
joined a Canadian-based repertory company in the mid-1970s. She
played Ophelia in a musical version of ``Hamlet'' on Canadian
television, and had the same role when it was brought to Broadway as
``Rockabye Hamlet.'' The show flopped.
   ``I strangled myself on stage while smoke bombs and fires went
off,'' she recalled.
   Movies, however, proved more successful for D'Angelo. Her debut
came in 1977 with a bit part in Woody Allen's Academy Award-winning
``Annie Hall.'' She followed that with roles in John Schlesinger's
``Honky Tonk Freeway,'' and the adaption of the musical, ``Hair.''
   ``That's when it started to click. I had been a painter, then I
wanted to be a singer. In `Hair,' I realized there was a tremendous
amount of freedom in playing different characters. You could play a
painter, play a singer. It suits my temperament.''
   In 1980, D'Angelo got to play the late country star Patsy Cline
in the highly acclaimed ``Coal Miner's Daughter.'' She has warm
memories of the film, especially of its star, Sissy Spacek.
   ``I always felt that the whole movie was a very wonderful
experience and it had everything to do with Sissy,'' D'Angelo said.
``She did such special work, and I really think a lot of the
atmosphere had to do with that she was such a wonderful person.''
   D'Angelo had known director Neil Jordan (``Mona Lisa'') and
quickly agreed to be in ``High Spirits.'' The atmosphere on the set
seemed to live up to the film's title.
   ``There are some scenes where you're watching Peter O'Toole,
Peter Gallagher, Little John (a street theater performer from
Dublin), Liam Neeson and me and Steve Guttenberg. All these people
came together. That was fascinating,'' she said.
   ``Everybody did have such different approaches. It was a process
of being quick on your feet all the time.''
   She especially enjoyed working with O'Toole.
   ``Peter O'Toole's a genius, and very charming. Peter's got one of
the all-time great reputations for having lived a life so it was a
pleasure to see that he's also the ultimate professional.''
   ``High Spirits'' has undergone changes since filming was
completed. The producers found the plot too complicated and ended up
eliminating material. D'Angelo was unhappy with some of the
alterations, but still defended the movie.
   ``This opened the Dublin Film Festival and I sat with 2,000
people who really, really enjoyed it,'' D'Angelo said.
   And she was happy to play the character that got booed.
   ``There's a lot of encouragment to play sympathetic roles. But in
this role, instead of going after someone's heart, you're going
after somebody's imagination.''

<HEAD>Student Linked to `Virus' Teaching Lawyer, Declining Offers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As a federal grand jury decides whether he
should be prosecuted, a graduate student linked to a ``virus'' that
disrupted computers nationwide last month has been teaching his
lawyer about the technical subject and turning down offers for his
life story.
   Robert Morris Jr. has declined offers from movie producers, book
publishers, magazines and television shows, said his lawyer, Thomas
Guidoboni.
   ``Robert is not interested,'' he said. ``He's not that kind of
person. ... He's fairly shy and isn't looking for publicity.''
   ``Until we get the potential criminal matter resolved,''
Guidoboni said, the 23-year-old Cornell University graduate student
will remain silent, despite heavy pressure to talk.
   ``It's not only the media. It's computer professionals, it's the
government, it's Cornell. I've even heard a rumor that Congress
wants to hear from him,'' said Guidoboni in an interview from
Washington, D.C.
   No charges have been filed against Morris, who reportedly told
friends that he designed the virus that temporarily clogged about
6,000 university and military computers linked to the Pentagon's
Arpanet network.
   A virus is a rogue computer program that can duplicate itself and
cripple or destroy existing computer systems.
   ``The grand jury investigation is continuing. They are looking
for specific criminal and federal violations that may have been
committed,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Baxter said Wednesday,
declining to be more specific.
   According to search warrants authorities executed at Harvard and
Cornell universities in the days following the Nov. 2 episode, FBI
investigators are reviewing statutes concerning computer fraud, wire
fraud, malicious mischief and unlawful access to stored
communications.
   ``But I can't say the grand jury is looking at the same thing,''
said Baxter.
   Recently, two Harvard University computer experts appeared before
the grand jury in Syracuse. They were computer programmer Andrew H.
Sudduth and graduate student Paul Graham.
   Morris attended Harvard before beginning a doctoral program in
computer science at Cornell.
   The grand jury also has heard from Dean Krafft, a Cornell
computer science research associate, and has reviewed Morris'
computer accounts from both universities.
   The three witnesses have declined to say what questions the grand
jury had asked or what information they provided the panel.
   According to published reports, Sudduth has said Morris called
him on the night of the outbreak to seek assistance in getting out a
warning to computer operators linked to the affected system.
   Morris, whose father, Robert T. Morris Sr., is the chief
scientist at the National Computer Security Center in Bethesda, Md.,
reportedly wrote the virus as an intellectual experiment and did not
intend any harm.
   The program apparently was intended to live undetected in the
Arpanet system in which it was first introduced and secretly make
copies that would move from computer to computer. However, a design
error caused it to replicate out of control in computers linked to
the system.
   Morris remains secluded at his parents' home in Arnold, Md.,
where he has been since the outbreak occurred.
   According to his lawyer, he's ``trying to keep busy and marking
his time until this is over.''
   ``He's doing volunteer work and spending a lot of time with me,
teaching an ignorant lawyer about a highly technical matter,'' said
Guidoboni.

<TEXT>
   The boy was up to no good and his
parents knew it.
   He was staying out late and skipping school. Strangers were
coming up to his bedroom window at 2 a.m. But he swore he wasn't
dealing drugs. The parents needed proof to set him straight and they
didn't want him to get arrested.
   They called in Corky, an eager yellow Labrador with a remarkably
effective nose.
   ``The dog found a quarter-ounce of coke in gram bags in a slit
under his rug,'' said Gene Panella, who trained 2-year-old Corky to
locate even minute amounts of marijuana, cocaine and heroin at $250
a sniff.
   Panella, owner of K9 of Broward, has found a lucrative new angle
on South Florida's ever-present drug trade _ working for private
citizens who want their property to be drug-free _ but has also
raised the ire of civil libertarians.
   ``In the past four months, he's been nearly every other day on a
search,'' said Panella, who claims Corky has found drugs in 32 of 33
homes.
   ``Families and corporations are mostly interested in getting help
for people on drugs, rather than arresting them. All I'm doing is
finding the evidence to confront them with.''
   Panella primarily breeds and trains guard dogs, but he decided to
branch out after boat owners began calling him for help from the
U.S. Coast Guard's ``zero tolerance'' policy of confiscating boats
found with minimal amounts of drugs on board.
   One was the owner of the 135-foot luxury yacht Corky searched in
Fort Lauderdale.
   ``When we got to the crew's quarters the dog just went bananas,''
Panella said. ``The owner fired the crew on the spot. He just
dropped them off on the dock.''
   Panella says he warns business executives that one offender can
leave drug residue all over an office. But he doesn't worry that the
dog might also implicate drug-free employees during his searches.
   ``I just tell them where it is. The rest is their problem.''
   Private employees are not constitutionally protected from drug
searches of their workplaces, but the prospect is nevertheless
disturbing to civil libertarians.
   ``It's funny to think of a dog as high-tech ... but it's clear
that this is a very highly invasive type of technology,'' said Paul
Joseph, vice president of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Florida. ``Our society is going to have to decide whether that is
acceptable.''
   But Jack Hook of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office
in Miami says Panella's services are sorely needed.
   ``How else can you stop the lawyer who stops by his favorite
crack house on the way home?'' Hook said. ``I think it's needed
because nothing has been done to stop the users.''
   There are other businesses like Panella's around the country, but
``there aren't very many of them, I'm sure,'' said Wayne Bohrer,
deputy chief of the DEA's state and industry section in Washington.
Panella said he had been contacted by someone in New York who wanted
to start a drug-dog business.
   Corky is so much in demand now that Panella is training a
4-month-old beagle named Daffy to handle the overflow.
   But dog owners daydreaming of making a fortune off Fido should
know that a good drug dog costs about $6,000 to train, and not all
types are suited for the work, Panella said.
   ``The biggest thing about training a drug dog is starting with
the right animal. You want the obnoxious, hyper, snotty types,'' he
said. ``You want them to get keyed up.''
   Panella has a special dispensation from the Drug Enforcement
Administration to keep the illegal drugs he needs to train his dogs.
But the animals never get to eat the drugs that drive them crazy.
   ``Everybody thinks the dogs are all junkies, but we never let
them touch the drugs,'' Panella said. ``I've seen dogs get stoned
out, and they're never the same after that.''

<HEAD>Dinner With Miss Ruby and Friends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A holiday dinner as sassy and sumptuous as the
one Miss Ruby serves up is a feast indeed.
   The table is set Tuesday on PBS for ``Miss Ruby's Southern
Holiday Dinner,'' and even Yankees will feel right at home with New
York restaurateur Ruth Adams Bronz, aka ``Miss Ruby,'' and her
guests: humorist Roy Blount Jr., entertainer Pearl Bailey, Annie
Potts of ``Designing Women,'' and food writer Craig Claiborne.
   Together they cook, eat and talk about some of the hallmarks of a
Southern Christmas feast _ Smithfield ham, which ``looks funny,
tastes real good,'' says Bronz; red-eye gravy; red snapper stuffed
with crab; turkey and cornbread stuffing; scalloped oysters and
derby pie. It's a delightful hour, for cooks and for eaters.
   Bronz, whose restaurant features a changing menu of regional
American foods, was ``raised in Texas by a Louisiana grandmother''
and so qualifies as a Southern cook. But she acknowledges at the
start that some will disagree with her version of the dishes:
``Every Southerner believes his South is the only true one.''
   Her guests come from Virginia (Bailey), Georgia (Blount),
Kentucky (Potts), and Mississippi (Claiborne), and have a range of
experience in the kitchen. Blount, for instance, mostly puts things
in and takes things out of the oven, tastes the food, and comments
on it: ``This is the prettiest ham. I've seen little children that
weren't as pretty.''
   Over cocktails, Potts and Bronz laugh about fruitcakes and
Yankees, and Claiborne and Blount discuss childhood Christmases,
including Claiborne's memories of breakfasts of quail and ham with
red-eye gravy and grits.
   When Claiborne makes his cornbread stuffing, he notes that it's
``not essential to cook these innards until they're quite
well-done'' because they'll cook in the turkey. But Blount wanders
into the kitchen, takes a handful of stuffing and bites into a raw
giblet, which Claiborne calls ``chicken gizzard sashimi.''
   At one point, Bronz coerces Blount and Potts to pick crab for the
snapper stuffing. As they work on a big pile of blue crabs, they
giggle and reminisce, and Blount, who steals a few bites and gets
caught with crabmeat on the end of his nose, lets on that he's
borrowed Claiborne's apron.
   ``When I used to try to cook things, people used to say, `You
couldn't wear Craig Claiborne's apron.' But I showed them,''' he
says.
   When Bronz was working with producer Robert Kanter and director
Michael Wolkowitz to plan ``Miss Ruby's Southern Holiday Dinner,''
it was decided to try to fit the celebrity guests in with the
cooking, said Bronz.
   That's authentic, Bronz said in a telephone interview, explaining
that her grandmother's generation would make long trips across the
prairie ``for house parties that would last six weeks over the
holidays. And I think that was in my mind in some way. .. . I had a
real vision of these people being in my kitchen.''
   The result is comfortable and welcoming, what Kanter calls a
``comedy-cooking-talk'' show.
   Bronz said she worried a little that the food would be
overwhelmed by all the commotion, but when serious work is under way
in the kitchen, the directions are clear and concise and easy to
follow. Viewers also can send for recipes.
   ``I really think good food is riveting. I don't think people will
wander from that,'' Bronz said. ``And we really set it up so that
when we weren't making food, we were talking about it. Southerners
just love to talk about food, and if they're not talking about food,
they're talking about family. And sometimes they're talking about
food and family.''
   There are dishes for cooks of all abilities. Potts makes her
derby pie in less than 5 minutes, and many people will sympathize
when she zaps the butter too long in a microwave oven and declares,
``It's spitting at me.'' Potts even admits she doesn't make her own
crust for her pie of pecans, chocolate chips, eggs and sugar.
   After filming, the food was donated to a shelter for homeless
people.
   The show is intended as the first of a series on American
regional cooking, including future similar holiday specials.
   Bronz said she is on a ``mission'' to promote American food,
announcing at the start: ``It's Miss Ruby's job to see that great
American food goes public.''
   Wish her well, for then we all can see more of Miss Ruby.

   When Marlo Thomas accompanied her husband,
Phil Donahue, to Moscow last year, she had more in mind than
sightseeing in Red Square.
   The trip gave her the idea for what will be the first
Soviet-American co-production of an entertainment show, her special
``Free to Be ... A Family,'' airing Wednesday on ABC.
   ``It's an entertainment exchange between kids and superstar
performers from this country and the Soviet Union,'' Thomas said.
``We present our favorite performers and they present theirs. It's a
fun show of comedy and song, but the show also challenges
destructive stereotypes about families.
   ``Our goal is to show children that every family, no matter who's
in it or where they live, is a real family as long as its members
nurture and love each other.
   ``We also talk about the global family. It's no longer `we' and
`they,' we have to start thinking of `us.' Steve Martin talks about
feeding the entire world with one turkey and how big it was would
have to be. Carly Simon sings the song that became our theme, `Turn
of the Tide.' It says we are the turn of the tide and we have to
speak up.''
   The one-hour special is a sequel to ``Free to Be ... You and
Me,'' which won Peabody and Emmy awards in 1984.
   Thomas made arrangements for the special while her husband was
taping a week's worth of his syndicated talk show ``Donahue'' in the
Soviet Union.
   ``Free to Be ... A Family'' was put together later by means of a
satellite hookup between the Hard Rock Cafe in New York and
Gosteleradio Studios in Moscow.
   Thomas is host of the special in New York and Tatiana Vedeneyeva
is host in Moscow. Among the American performers are the rock group
Bon Jovi, actress Whoopi Goldberg, comic magicians Penn and Teller,
singer-songwriter Carly Simon, comedians Lily Tomlin and Robin
Williams, and Muppets Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.
   ``We started work on the special last September,'' said Thomas.
``It was very complicated to put together. This is the first jointly
produced American-Soviet entertainment program. ... We have 40
Soviet kids and 40 American kids, and we sing over the `space
bridge' satellite. The kids were selected a year ago and got to know
each other by exchanging letters and photos.''
   A ``Free to Be ... A Family'' book was published in 1987, and
half a million copies have been sold. An album featuring many of the
stars on the special was issued last month.
   ``Soviet rock star Vladimir Prezhnikof is on the show. I was
surprised to learn the Russians dance to the same dance steps we do
and know more about us than we know about them. They know all of our
rock stars and see our movies.''
   Thomas said the first project, ``Free to Be ... You and Me'' was
an attempt to rewrite children's literature to eliminate sexual and
ethnic stereotypes.
   ``There were too many stories about Prince Charming coming along
and carrying the girl off,'' she said. ``I wanted to liberate the
definition of boy and girl the way we had liberated the definition
of men and women. The new book liberates the definition of the
family and expands its meaning.''
   With the special completed, Thomas is now on to other things.
She's just completed a comedy-mystery called ``In the Spirit.'' It
co-stars Elaine May, Peter Falk and Olympia Dukakis.
   ``Elaine plays a Hollywood wife, and I'm a New Age health food
store owner who thinks all the world's problems would be solved if
people would just stop eating meat,'' she said. ``We're being chased
by someone who thinks we know about a murder.''
   Next, she will star in a feature film for 20th Century Fox called
``A Point of Light.'' It's a story of a rural family and probably
will be filmed in Vermont.
   She will also co-star with her father, Danny Thomas, in a CBS
drama called ``Deception.'' She said, ``We play father and
daughter,'' he said. ``We look alike so what else could we play?''

<HEAD>Holiday Decorations, Use Care</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual crop of holiday greenery is
sprouting in American homes. Enjoying those decorations also means
using some care to avoid fire and keep children from poisoning
themselves accidentally.
   Some of the most popular plants used for holiday decorations are
poisonous, according to the National Clearinghouse for Poison
Control Centers.
   Holly is popular because of its bright green leaves and red
berries, but the berries can be dangerous if eaten.
   Swallowing the berries can lead to diarrhea, vomiting and
depression of the central nervous system, the Poison Control Center
says.
   Mistletoe berries are another danger, containing chemicals that
can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, high blood pressure
and even collapse of the circulatory system, medical authorities
say. In addition, diarrhea, weakness, low blood pressure and other
problems can occur from eating any part of the yew plant.
   Those lovely red poinsettias can be troublesome too. Health
officials say that if any part of the plant is swallowed it can
cause abdominal discomfort, while the milky sap from the leaves can
cause an irritation or dermatitis in some people.
   Another decoration danger is fire, with Christmas trees and other
greenery a major problem.
   Try to keep the tree as moist as possible, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission urges. After bringing it home cut off a few inches
of the base and place it in water. And keep the tree well watered
when in use.
   Buyers should avoid dry trees, of course. A good test is to pull
on some needles and see if they resist. The harder they are to pull
off, the better.
   If the cut part of the tree is sticky with resin, that's a good
sign.
   Try bouncing the tree on the ground a bit: a shower of falling
needles tells you that it's too dry.
   When going to bed or leaving the house turn off lights on trees
and other decorations, the commission said. And never use candles on
trees or near greens.
   Check all lights for broken bulbs and frayed wires before
installing them, and discard any damaged strings.
   Never use lights on a metallic artificial tree. A faulty string
can cause the entire tree to become charged, potentially causing an
electrocution. This type of tree can be brightened by a spotlight
shining on it.
   Other safety suggestions from the Safety Commission include:
   _Artificial snow sprays can irritate the lungs if inhaled. Read
the directions carefully and follow them.
   _Wear gloves when decorating with spun glass ``angel hair'' to
avoid irritation to eyes and skin.
   _Use plastic ``tinsel'' rather than the leaded kinds which could
be hazardous if ingested.
   _In homes with children be especially careful of using fragile
decorations or items with sharp points or which resemble candy or
food.
   _Before lighting any fire make sure trimmings and wrapping paper
are clear of the area. Do not burn wrappings in the fireplace.

<HEAD>Glasnost Has Not Entered House Where Trotsky Was Killed</HEAD>

   The grandson of Leon Trotsky sat in the room
where one of Stalin's assassins killed the old revolutionary with an
ax and pondered how far the new, more enlightened Kremlin would go
toward making amends.
   ``If glasnost wants to have authenticity ... it must recognize
the proper place of Leon Trotsky'' in history, Esteban Volkow
Bronstein said, using the word denoting the more open Soviet
policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The latest sign of change came Dec. 6, when Volkow received
permission to visit his half-sister Alexandra, who is dying of
cancer in Moscow. He has not been to the Soviet Union or seen his
sister in 57 years, and learned only last month that she was alive.
   ``It's all part of Gorbachev's policy,'' Volkow said, and Trotsky
has been emerging slowly from ``the dark cave'' of Soviet history
since glasnost began.
   ``For 50 or 60 years the Russian public has been conditioned to
think of him as almost the devil,'' his grandson said. ``You can't
change black to white in one day.''
   Leon Trotsky, born Lev Davidovich Bronstein in 1879, was among
the most popular leaders of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution _
commander of the Red Army, commissar for war and foreign affairs,
the right hand of Lenin. After losing a power struggle with Josef
Stalin, he became a ``non-person.''
   Stalin exiled him in 1929 and Trotsky's name was stricken from
Soviet history. Photographs and film were doctored to erase his
image. Real and imagined followers were hunted down, and imprisoned
or killed.
   Trotsky's road ended on a summer afternoon in at his desk in the
modest house in Coyoacan, in those days was a quiet village.
Coyoacan is enveloped by the smog of Mexico City now, but in the
house itself little has change since the assassin entered it Aug.
20, 1940, with a mountaineer's ice ax.
   It has no plaques, polished display cases or uniformed guards,
but there is a caretaker to greet visitors. He answers the bell,
shows them through the rooms and hands them the guest book to sign.
   ``There was a terrible solitude, an emptiness here in the
house,'' Volkow said, remembering the years after the assassination.
He was born in the Soviet Union to Trotsky's daughter Zina and now
is 62, a semi-retired chemical engineer.
   Trotsky's house always has attracted a few Soviet visitors, he
said, but more have come in the past year or so.
   ``They are opening windows in Russia,'' Volkow said. ``They are
turning on the light. There is a freshness.''
   Glasnost has not altered Trotsky's official status but his name
sometimes is mentioned publicly and the Soviet Supreme Court
rehabilitated a son, Volkow's step-uncle Sergei Sedov, who died in a
Stalin purge.
   In September, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda called Trotsky
an ``enemy of Stalin'' rather than an enemy of ``socialism'' and the
revolution.
   ``I believe that his heroic struggle, almost alone, against one
of the most terrible, the bloodiest tyrannies in history is the
stage of his life that is going to have the most historical
importance,'' Volkow said.
   A quiet river that ran behind Trotsky's house two generations ago
has become a stream of vehicles belching fumes on a freeway, but in
the shadowed rooms, behind thick walls, time seems congealed.
   ``It's curious. He didn't live here long ...but he impregnated
the house with his presence,'' the grandsom said.
   Beside the reading lamp, the dictaphone waits next to books in
French, German, Russian, Spanish and English on Hitler, capitalism,
Italian fascism, colonialism, British trade unionism.
   The bloodstains on Trotsky's chair have faded but bullet holes
from an earlier assassination attempt still pock the bedroom walls.
   He had the windows shuttered with steel and the gateway bricked
up after the attack May 24, 1940, by Mexican Stalinists with machine
guns.
   Three months later, a Stalinist agent who had insinuated himself
into the Trotsky circle attacked with the ice ax. When Volkow, then
14, entered the room his grandfather lay on the floor, bleeding, his
wife at his side.
   The assassin spent 20 years in prison but his identity never was
confirmed. He was thought to be a Spaniard, Ramon del Rio Mercader,
but also was known as Jacques Mornard and Frank Jackson.
   Volkow said Trotsky treated each day after the May attack as a
bonus: ``Every morning after he got up, he would say `Another day of
life, Natalia. Another day of life.'''
   Natalia Sedov, Trotsky's second wife, lived in the house for more
than 20 years after the assassination. She died in Paris in 1962.
   In the garden, a simple gray stone monument carved with a hammer
and sickle encloses the ashes of Trotsky and Natalia.
   A red flag flutters overhead.

<HEAD>Italian Women Getting Ahead, Say Men Must Catch Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCES D'EMILIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's hottest anchorwoman hikes her skirt on the
evening news, gets sozzled on champagne from male admirers and,
before signing off, invites men to call her on a special line.
   It happens in a television spoof of television, written and
directed by women, but real life is getting closer. State television
has a woman news reader.
   ``When you feel secure, you can poke fun at yourself,'' said
Serena Dandini, one of three authors of the new weekly show ``TiVu
Delle Ragazze'' (The Girls' Television).
   An increasing number of prime time newscasts feature women, and
Italian women are becoming prominent in many other fields once
closed to them.
   Women drive Rome's orange-colored buses in bumper-to-bumper
traffic ever more frequently directed by female traffic officers.
   Policewomen wave automatic rifles out the windows of squad cars
as they escort ministers and dignitaries. Until 1981, the national
police force assigned women only to cases involving prostitution or
children.
   Sunday afternoon soccer, that ultimate male bastion, now has a
woman as one of the play-by-play radio commentators. The games are
not televised live.
   When the first woman justice was named to the Supreme Court in
September, she was asked what it meant to enter a world previously
reserved for men.
   ``It signifies that women are present, that they're doing their
job,'' Maria Gabriella Luccioli said. She began her judicial career
in 1963, when women were permitted to become magistrates.
   Marisa Occhionero, a Rome University sociologist who has done
studies for the government on the future of women, said the movement
into top positions is increasing and remains merely a ``question of
time.''
   ``Professors at universities ... engineers, businesswomen,
architects,'' she enumerated. ``They're not content to stay in civil
service jobs. The woman is changing. She has changed. It's the man
who hasn't changed.''
   Women in fields ranging from politics to banking echoed her
comment in interviews. They reported tremendous gains at work but
much less success in persuading men to help mind the house and
children.
   A survey of city families with both spouses working found the men
put in an average of 3-5 hours a week at such chores as home repairs
and cleaning the car while women did 33-35 hours of housework.
   Carole Beebe Tarantelli, an American who serves in the
Parliament, said changing sex roles are difficult for an Italian man
``whose mother would respond to every whim.''
   Newly married Italian men often are dismayed to discover that
their wives, working or not, will not iron their underwear like
their mothers did.
   ``The Italian woman's (struggle) is especially hard'' because of
the importance placed on the family and the concept of the mother as
its pillar, Ms. Occhionero said.
   It often is difficult to run an Italian family, given the
structure of Italian society, especially for working mothers.
   Mrs. Tarantelli, a mother, noted that public schools don't have
team sports or other extracurricular activities. That means
babysitters for children who finish classes at 1 p.m., five or six
hours before parents finish work.
   Stores close three hours for lunch and only a few stay open past
8 p.m. In the Tuscan hilltown of Arezzo, complaints by factory
workers that the only day care center shut down before the factory
did prompted the town to open another with more suitable hours.
   Gioia Longo, a cultural anthropologist who founded a hotline for
abused women, said a survey she did of 700 teen-agers in an Adriatic
resort town indicated girls see no limits on possible achievement
but boys are confused about their changing roles.
   Ms. Occhionero said stereotypical Latin males ``are afraid of
these women. They want to protect them but don't understand to what
point, (and) they are threatened.''
   Stefania Zappanico, a journalist in her 20s, says many women
don't help their cause.
   ``Italian women are still different from northern European or
American women,'' said Ms. Zappanico, who has spent time in Britain
and the United States. ``They're not mentally independent. Even
women who work think they have to depend on men. They don't value
independence that much in itself.''
   In a nationwide study of women's lot in the 1870s, the first
years of a unified Italy, an official in Bari said ``an ass, an ox,
a sheep are always worth more than a wife to the peasant, and the
wife obeys her husband like a slave.''
   A simple rendezvous could get a wife convicted of adultery a
brief generation ago but a husband could be prosecuted only if he
brought his lover to live in the house. A 1969 Supreme Court
decision led to adultery being abolished as a crime for either sex.
   Birth control pills were legalized in the early 1970s and
abortion in 1978.
   Children of an Italian man who marries a foreigner always have
qualified for citizenship automatically, but those of a woman in the
same situation did not qualify until 1984.
   Dictator Benito Mussolini thought a woman's place was home making
babies, but some historians feel his policy of getting women out of
the workplace helped them in the long run because many enrolled in
universities when they could not get jobs.
   As more and more Italian women enter politics, their issues are
certain to get more attention. Ms. Occhionero said women are ``ever
more present'' in the field but still scarce ``in proportion to
their effort.''

   The Burger King near Penn Station lets homeless
customers have it their way, up to a point. The welcome ends if
owners think the restaurant is becoming a stopgap shelter for smelly
transients.
   ``Sometimes it's difficult to put people out because you know
they have no place to go,'' said night manager Cecil Murray. ``But
you can't have vagrants. It scares the normal customers.
   ``Some come in for five or 10 minutes just to get warm and won't
buy anything. Some end up sitting there with the same thing for an
hour. I ask them to leave. I can't have my boss see the whole place
full of vagrants,'' he said.
   A week ago, a homeless alcoholic man was dragged from a fast food
eatery in San Francisco and deposited on the sidewalk after passing
out over his meal. He lay there five hours before anyone noticed he
was dead. Homeless advocates decried the incident as a too-common
example of society's callousness.
   The San Francisco episode highlights the predicament of fast-food
restaurants, which have become beacons for the homeless. They don't
want to banish people to the streets, but neither do they want their
family atmosphere disrupted by shabby creatures, sometimes lugging
all their worldly possessions in shopping bags and carts.
   Some places deal with the problem by posting time limits. The
Burger King on Eighth Avenue allows no customer to linger longer
than 20 minutes.
   ``It's fast food. We need the seating space,'' said manager Mike
Barnes. ``But if someone passed out inside, I would call an
ambulance. You just can't carry them out to the street, especially
if they had made a purchase.''
   Other places make case-by-case decisions.
   ``If they smell and bother other customers, we tell them to
leave,'' said Jose Choe, who runs a McDonald's on Canal Street in
lower Manhattan.
   ``We don't set a limit on how much money or how much time they
spend, as long as nobody is offended,'' said Jose Martinez, manager
of a McDonald's near Grand Central Station. ``If someone in a suit
and tie is being a real pain, we would escort them out.''
   Advocates say thousands of homeless seek refuge in subway cars,
train stations, bus depots or burger joints.
   ``There are parts of the country I've been in where the local
Dunkin Donuts is an emergency shelter by default,'' said Robert
Hayes, founder of the city's Coalition for the Homeless.
   ``As night follows day, a human being afflicted by a cold wind is
going to look for refuge,'' Hayes said. ``But nobody with a
reasonable option is going to sleep in a McDonald's. If there were
reasonable alternatives, this problem would disappear.''
   An estimated 30,000 to 45,000 people stay in abandoned buildings
or public places nightly in New York, not counting the ones sleeping
in shelters, Hayes said. An October survey by the Transit Authority
found 1,404 homeless living in New York subways.
   Nationwide, no accurate census exists, but an estimated 3 million
people are without homes, according to the National Coalition for
the Homeless, based in Washington, D.C. It agrees that restaurants
make lousy sleeping quarters.
   ``These places are not designed to function as housing,'' said
Maria Foscarinis, spokeswoman for the coalition.
   ``But there is no place else to go.''

   Ireland's potato farmers, who have a most

demand and rising imports, the spud raisers are modernizing in order
to compete.

   It was a dismal day, wet and cold and
gray _ the things most hateful about December. A few potatoes were
rotting and their smell was vile, but John Sheridan didn't seem to
mind.
   Tramping across a muck-filled yard in his rubber boots, the
42-year-old potato farmer showed a visitor around with typical Irish
generosity of time and spirit.
   Highlights of the tour of J and C Sheridan Ltd., one of Ireland's
biggest potato farms, included a new bagging machine and storehouses
full of those humblest of tubers, whose irregular shapes and skins
of homespun brown inspire instant affection.
   ``We are putting our potatoes in much more attractive
packaging,'' said Sheridan, who is spending about 630,000 Irish
pounds (nearly $1 million) to modernize the farm. ``The emphasis all
the time, every single day, is better quality. I am ensuring that my
market will be there.''
   Welcome to the brave new world of the Irish potato industry,
launching the praties of legend into the 21st century.
   Ireland's potato farmers, who have a most colorful past, are
fighting for a future dimmed by imports and a drop in demand.
   In the 19th century, potatoes were the staple food of Ireland and
blight caused a cruel famine. Lately, the Irish have strayed to such
exotic foods as pasta and farmers are trying to woo them back by,
among other things, developing better-looking potatoes.
   What is a good-looking potato?
   ``What's a good-looking man?'' responded Kevin Burke, general
manager of Irish Potato Marketing Ltd. in Dublin, about 30 miles
southeast of Wilkinstown. ``Very subjective,'' he concluded.
   The ideal spud is said to be large, well-rounded and shallow-eyed.
   Presentation matters, too. Farmers are packaging their products
better, offering consumers cleaner potatoes in smaller quantities
and more uniform sizes.
   They are investing in better machinery and storage facilities,
breeding higher-yield varieties that are more resistant to disease
and will deliver larger crops per acre. They now export, to counter
imports from other Common Market countries, and support development
of a potato processing industry.
   Experts say the effort is paying off.
   Gerry Doherty of the government's Department of Agriculture and
Food said a long decline in output is stabilizing. The total was
400,000 tons last year and is expected to be about 370,000 for 1988,
he said.
   Imports are expected to be 30,000 tons this year and exports
13,400. A ton of potatoes brings about 90 pounds ($140).
   ``I'd say we're more competitive,'' Doherty said.
   Potatoes have been grown in Ireland for more than 350 years and
are woven into its culture and history. They have inspired poems and
songs. They conjure many images, warm as Irish stew or wrenching as
famine and emigration.
   ``So great has been its influence that the potato and the
Irishman are often considered as somewhat synonymous,'' potato
expert Edward McGivern wrote.
   Spaniards brought potatoes to Europe from Peru in the 16th
century. English explorer Sir Walter Raleigh usually gets the credit
for introducing them to the Emerald Isle.
   Ireland was the first European country to grow potatoes on a
large scale. By the early 1840s they were the main food for
one-third of its 8 million people.
   Planting reached a peak of 2.5 million acres in 1845 but blight
destroyed the crop and caused the Great Famine of 1845-1849, a
catastrophe that killed an estimated 1 million people and caused
another million to leave.
   Emigration continues and the birth rate is declining, so
Ireland's population now is but 3.4 million and potato acreage is a
mere 75,000. Commercial growers, once tens of thousands, number only
6,000.
   Burke, the Dublin potato dealer, said Ireland's entry into the
European Economic Community in 1973 ``has created competition, and a
lot of people were not ready to cope.''
   ``People are now eating things which are considered alien to the
Irish character, such as pasta and rice,'' he said.
   Use of potatoes for industrial alcohol and animal feed has
declined. With more women working and incomes growing, fewer
potatoes are peeled and cooked at home.
   Per capita consumption fell to 244 pounds in 1984 from 260 pounds
in 1980, but still is nearly double that of the United States.
   Sheridan surveyed the farm where he first planted 12 acres of
potatoes in 1967 and today grows 250 acres of Kerr's Pink, the Irish
favorite.
   ``We are managing to meeting the challenge,'' he said. ``We
believe we'll be in business another 20 years.''

<TEXT>
   On his suddenly shortened visit, Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev achieved every out-of-towner's dream of making
it big in the Big Apple. He saw his name in lights on Broadway.
   As his 45-car motorcade moved through Times Square at the height
of rush hour, one of those huge news headline display signs flashed
``Welcome, Gorbachev.''
   The chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet got the
friendly message.
   At the corner of 5lst and Broadway, the tank-like Zil limousine
came to a halt, a smiling Gorbachev stepped out and began pressing
the flesh as the crowd chanted ``Gorby! Gorby!''
   His startled security detail, led by bomb squad vans and a legion
of motorcycles, executed an illegal U-turn that further confounded
cross-town traffic already immobilized by ``Gorby-lock.''
   Here are other scenes from a reporter's notebook on the brief
visit of the statesman-tourist from Moscow:
   _ Something like 180,000 commuters heeded Mayor Ed Koch's warning
against coming to town during Gorbachev's visit. The number of
vehicles entering Manhattan by bridge and tunnel dropped 20 percent,
bringing about a new Christmas miracle on 34th Street in the
vicinity of Macy's department store, where a police inspector
observed that traffic was ``no more chaotic than normal.'' The
motorcade's l6-minute dash from the United Nations to South Ferry
was the envy of New York taxi drivers and should qualify as a modern
record in daylight hours. New York's traffic commissars were
serious. They even posted parking meters with signs in Russian:
``Don't Even Think of Parking.''
   _ When the curtains were drawn, the squat, highly polished,
somewhat antiquated Soviet black limousines flown in with Gorbachev
looked as if they had strayed off course from a Mafia funeral along
Mulberry Street. Cabbies, however, had high praise for the Russians
behind the wheel. ``Being wheel man in a motorcade is real
tsuriss,'' said taxi driver Moishe Abramson of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn,
using the Yiddish word for tension and trouble. ``Gorby's visit
buried the old joke we had around the U.N. about a Russian motorcade
being a 10-car pile-up with flags.''
   _ On the ``Tonight Show'' Johnny Carson had a topical gag about
Gorbachev's promised half-million cut in Soviet troop strength:
``Soon the Russians will be down to just one obsolete tank, driven
by Mike Dukakis.''
   _ Coast Guard Capt. Michael Garwin estimated he had made ``6,400
crossings'' on the five-minute Governors Island ferry run before
being grabbed by news anchors Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings for
prime-time interviews. And with Gorbachev aboard, this was the first
time police frog men in their wet suits had inspected the hull of
the ferry T. Samuel Coursen minutes before lines were cast off.
   _ Two Transit Authority cops amused the crowd outside the New
York Stock Exchange by harmonizing on ``Shultz and Shevardnadze,''
to the tune of ``Some Enchanted Evening,'' while waiting for the
motorcade to roll by the cathedral of capitalism.
   _ Raisa Gorbachev, the style-conscious Soviet first lady who
calls designer Givenchy by his first name of Hubert, helped bury the
cartoon caricature of frumpy Soviet women in galoshes and babushkas.
In a visit to Estee Lauder's Fifth Avenue beauty salon, she was
sprayed with a fragrance called ``White Linen'' by the cosmetic
queen herself, who plans to open a branch soon on Moscow's Gorky
Street. Raisa also made a brief stop outside Bloomigdale's, the
upscale market version of Moscow's Gum department store, but didn't
have time to flash her American Express card.
   According to rumors spread by refuseniks, she never leaves her
dacha without it.
   Some Christmas shoppers like Faye Bernardi of Ozone Park, N.Y.,
thought they detected the ``look of longing in her eyes that we
women get when afflicted with that shop-until-you drop syndrome.''
Or maybe it was the look a Muscovite gets when peering into the
windows of a Beryozka shop, where luxury goods can be bought only
with foreign currency.
   _ Nearly 60 students protesting on behalf of Soviet Jews were
arrested on the final night of Gorbachev's visit, but the number of
demonstrators fell far below what police had anticipated. Among a
variety of ethnic and political dissenters was a small group of
animals lovers fuming against Raisa's broadtail Persian taupe
topcoat and Russian lynx fur hat with signs proclaiming ``minx
stinx.''
   _ The visit, of course, was a media carnival. One of the more
ingenious sideshows featured a Canadian actor, a Gorbachev
look-alike, who conned super capitalist Donald Trump into a hoax
interview after the real Soviet leader had turned down an invitation
to visit his $19 million apartment in Trump Tower.
   _ A yogurt emporium in the alley behind the stock exchange
dressed up its luncheon menu with a message in the Cyrillic
alphabet. Translated it read: ``Have a nice glasnost.''
   _ With Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and George Bush gazing
meaningfully at the Statue of Liberty from Liberty Point, Governors
Island had its most memorable historical happening since Wouter Van
Twiller, the second Dutch governor of the New Netherlands, purchased
the 173-acre tract from local Indians for two axe heads and a
fistful of nails and named it Nutten Island.
   On a sparkling day, the tiny island with its sudden promise of
long sought world peace almost seemed the inspiration for the
closing paragraphs of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby'':
   ``The old island that flowered once for Dutch sailor's eyes _ a
fresh, green breast of the New World. Its vanished trees had once
pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams.

   A former director of the New York Federal
Reserve Bank has been charged with leaking confidential interest
rate information to a securities brokerage.
   Prosecutors said Thursday's indictment was the first insider
trading case involving government securities.
   Robert A. Rough received $47,000 in interest-deferred loans from
the now defunct Bevill, Bresler & Schulman investment firm in
exchange for the information, the indictment charged.

   Technical factors and concerns about production
have sent crude oil futures sharply lower.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
30 cents lower Thursday at $15.44 a barrel, after rising 28 cents on
Wednesday. Other contract months also declined.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Thursday,
the January contract for wholesale home heating oil closed 0.81 cent
lower at 48.08 cents a gallon. The contract had risen 0.29 cent
Wednesday.
   But January unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.59 cent on Wednesday,
settled at 43.93 cents a gallon, up 0.17 cent from Wednesday's
session.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said
prices started out strong, with the January contract for West Texas
Intermediate trading as high as $15.97 a barrel. But when the
contract failed to pierce the psychologically important $16-a-barrel
level, a selloff began, he said.
   ``As the price approached the $16 level they (traders) found
themselves asking themselves whether the market was bullish enough
to merit that price,'' Beutel explained. ``They came to the
realization that it was not as strong fundamentally.''
   Beutel said recent reports of higher-than-expected oil production
have concerned many traders.

   Mikhail Gorbachev's peacemaking New York visit
and the opening of a glitzy Soviet trade show underscored the
importance the Kremlin leader attaches to developing business and
commercial ties in the West.
   But perhaps unknown to many Westerners, the Communist superpower
has long been dabbling in overseas ventures that range from currency
speculation in London to fish canning in North America.
   While Gorbachev may reduce the Soviet military, as he pledged in
a speech at the United Nations, experts on the Soviet bloc said they
believe his broader reforms likely will make the Soviets much more
aggressive in foreign investing, exporting and competing for
customers in an increasingly global economy.
   ``They're beginning to talk about more direct investment abroad,
focused on firms that might help them market their own products,''
said Edward Hewitt, a Soviet economics expert at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington research organization. ``I wouldn't be at
all surprised if they come in and buy out some small European or
U.S. firms in the next few years.''
   The Soviets have not acquired any significant Western companies
yet, but the number of foreign firms owned wholly or partly by the
Soviets has risen sharply from about a dozen in the early 1960s to
more than 120 now, said Carl McMillan, a Soviet expert at Carleton
University in Ottawa.
   McMillan, who has compiled a list of Soviet bloc-owned companies
in the West for the past 10 years, said many of these ventures
reflect a growing sophistication about investing abroad.
   ``There are different ways in which they do it,'' he said. ``They
have assets, portfolios and direct investments. They're in a wide
range of business areas: banks, insurance, engineering, shipping and
commercial companies.''
   The Soviet investment presence abroad remains minuscule by
Western standards, however, considering that just one U.S. or
Japanese conglomerate might have 120 foreign subsidiaries. Still,
the Soviets appear to be catching on.
   ``As they participate in the world economy, they've found this is
the way everybody else plays the game,'' McMillan said.
   In Scandinavia, for example, the Soviets have established a chain
of government-owned service stations to sell one of their biggest
exports, petroleum.
   On this side of the world, the Soviets have stakes in two North
American fishing and fish-processing concerns, Cansov Marine
Products Ltd. in Nova Scotia and Marine Resources Co. International
in Seattle.
   As one of the largest producers of agricultural machinery and
equipment, the Soviets have long been in the business of selling
tractors. In 1972, they formed Belarus Equipment of Canada Ltd., a
Toronto-based marketer of Soviet farm vehicles. A U.S. branch was
formed five years later, with offices in New York and Milwaukee.
   ``I would say this sort of trend will continue, and under
Gorbachev it will be more dynamic,'' said McMillan. ``I don't think
`The Russians Are Coming' thing really fits. They've been around for
awhile.''
   The Soviets also are veteran participants in the world's
speculative foreign-exchange markets, trading largely through two
government-owned banks, Moscow Norodny in London and the Eurobank in
Paris. Each is believed to have about $5 billion in assets.
   Because the ruble is not a convertible currency, the Soviets must
use Western money in order to pay for goods imported from
non-communist trading parters. As with other currency speculators,
the Soviets like to move their holdings into the currency that is
worth the most at any given time.
   They are said to favor the Swiss franc, although they also have
deposits and trading accounts denominated in dollars, British
pounds, West German marks and Japanese yen.
   ``They used to be into wild speculation, but they're more careful
now,'' said Jan Vanous, a Soviet expert at Planecon, a
Washington-based consulting and information concern that studies the
centrally planned economies of the Soviet bloc.
   A few years ago, for example, Soviet traders attempted to push
down the value of the Swiss franc by dumping $50 million worth of
francs in 20 separate orders throughout Europe, assuming dealers
would not be able to communicate fast enough about who was selling.
The Soviets were wrong, losing money and respect.
   ``It really caused a lot of bad blood,'' Vanous said. ``You do
this to someone in the foreign-exchange market, and the next time
they deal with you they're extra careful.''
   Some traders have privately accused the Soviets of eavesdropping
on international telephone lines for advance word on central bank
coordination and intervention, which often moves a currency sharply.
   The Moscow Norodny bank, for example, is believed to have once
made huge profits on marks it bought just before the mark soared in
value after the West German Bundesbank made a surprise policy shift.
   That change resulted from a telephone conversation hours earlier
between aides from the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve in
Washington, and according to one widely circulated story the Soviets
learned about it through a wiretap.
   On the other hand, the Soviets can show remarkable naivete about
economic trends that hurt their currency holdings. They were active
buyers of dollars just before the currency tumbled because of a
coordination agreement by the leading Western democracies and the
collapse of oil prices a few years ago.
   ``Generally they are savvy in the short run, but they don't do
too well in the long run,'' said Vanous. ``They are miserable in
making forecasts. They don't have the trained people, the
information, and keep making judgments based on their own behavior.''

<TEXT>
   Business Week's former broadcast editor, Seymour
G. ``Rudy'' Ruderman, has pleaded guilty to mail fraud in an insider
trading scheme, admitting he illegally used advance material from
the magazine to buy and sell securities.
   Ruderman admitted on Thursday making $15,000 between January 1986
and last July in securities trades, using not-yet-published
information from upcoming issues of the nation's biggest business
weekly.
   The 62-year-old editor waived indictment and pleaded guilty to
two counts of mail fraud before U.S. District Judge Robert Ward, who
released him on $100,000 bond.
   Ward scheduled sentencing for March 8, 1989. Ruderman faces a
maximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines on
each count.
   Ruderman, who had broadcast market and business news for Business
Week since 1981, was fired Aug. 12 for failing to disclose all his
stock trades and the full extent of his holdings, in violation of
the magazine's ethics code.
   The first criminal charges were filed in the widening scandal
last August. William Dillon, a stock broker who had been fired by
Merrill Lynch & Co., for suspcious trades was charged with mail
fraud.
   Seven employees of Business Week's printer also lost their jobs,
a result of an in-house investigation that allegedly found workers
sold advance copies of Business Week. Two brokers at two other
investment firms also were fired.
   Ruderman did not report, write or edit stories for Business Week.
But he broadcast a business news report several times a day from the
magazine's office in midtown Manhattan to radio stations in New
York, Boston, Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Ind.
   According to the charges, Ruderman used information obtained
largely from Business Week's market-sensitive ``Inside Wall Street''
column to buy and sell securities on 50 occasions.
   ``A security that received a favorable mention in that column
generally increased in price in the period immediately following
public dissemination of Business Week,'' court papers said.
   In entering his plea, Ruderman said he probably lost more money
than he made in his securities trading.
   According to the charges, Ruderman regularly received a page
proof of the ``Inside Wall Street'' column on Thursdays _ hours
before its official release to the public _ to make sure companies
mentioned in the column were not referred to in radio broadcasts.
Ruderman also was free to use the information in his weekend
reports, which were taped on Fridays.
   Instead, Ruderman bought shares or options to buy shares, and
caused unidentified ``other persons'' to purchase securities in
companies receiving favorable mention in the upcoming column.
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani refused to characterize who the
``other persons'' were but said the investigation was continuing.
   He also commended Business Week and its publisher, McGraw-Hill
Inc., for their cooperation.
   Ruderman conducted transactions in the securities of such
companies as Champion Spark Plug, Chrysler Corp., MCA Inc., Getty
Petroleum and Jefferies Group Inc.
   Giuliani noted that Ruderman was charged with mail fraud for
victimizing the magazine, which is delivered by mail.
   Ruderman was not charged with securities fraud for insider
trading, the prosecutor said, because the U.S. Supreme Court split
4-4 on that issue last year in the case of former Wall Street
Journal reporter R. Foster Winans.
   The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the mail and wire fraud
convictions of Winans for using advance knowledge of upcoming
Journal columns to make illegal trading profits. But the court split
over a broad interpretation of ``misappropriation'' of confidential
information that would have included revealing yet-to-be published
newspaper and magazine stories.
   Noting that the penalty for mail fraud and securities fraud were
the same, Giuliani said ``from a criminal (law) point of view, this
is a safer way to achieve the same results.''

   A former president of the New Jersey Bankers
Association has been accused of leaking highly secret Federal
Reserve Board interest rate figures to a now-bankrupt brokerage firm
seeking a jump on the securities market.
   An indictment returned here Thursday charged Robert A. Rough with
insider trading while a member of the New York Federal Reserve Bank,
part of the Fed's regional network, from 1982 to 1984.
   Rough, 49, of Layton, N.J., received $47,000 in interest-deferred
loans from the now-defunct Bevill, Bresler & Schulman investment
firm in exchange for the information, the indictment charged.
   Rough is accused of relaying the data by telephone from his
executive suite at the National Bank of Sussex County and once from
the New York Fed's boardroom just after a meeting, prosecutors told
a news conference.
   Bevill, Bresler made millions of dollars in government securities
trades based on Rough's advance word about decisions made by the
national Federal Reserve Board on the discount rate and on
recommendations made by the New York Fed about the discount rate,
the indictment said.
   Changes in the discount rate, the interest charged by the Fed on
loans to banks, can have a strong impact on financial markets.
   Rough's attorney, Michael Himmel, would not comment in detail but
said: ``Mr. Rough is going to enter a plea of not guilty and
vigorously contest the charges.''
   Rough's home telephone number is unlisted and he could not be
reached for comment. He resigned earlier this year as president of
the National Bank of Sussex in Branchville, N.J.
   The New York Fed is one of 12 regional banks in the Federal
Reserve System, all of which make recommendations every two weeks on
whether the discount rate should be changed. The national Federal
Reserve Board has the final say in setting the rate.
   Word that discount rate information was leaked surfaced in April
1987 during a trial stemming from the collapse of Bevill, Bresler,
prompting the Fed to tighten its rules on disclosing the discount
rate.
   The allegations came to light during the trial of Gilbert C.
Schulman, Bevill, Bresler's president, on charges stemming from the
$144 million collapse of the Livingston, N.J.-based firm in April
1985. Three other principals who pleaded guilty in the firm's
collapse in exchange for their cooperation testified about Rough's
allegedly passing on the information.
   Schulman, a long-time friend of Rough's, is serving an 8-year
sentence for securities violations.
   Schulman testified that Rough approached him for the $47,000 in
loans to buy a chunk of stock in the National Bank of Sussex.
   Rough faces 29 years in prison if convicted on all counts, said
U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. Rough was charged with conspiracy
to commit wire and securities fraud, two counts of bank fraud, one
count each of wire fraud and securities fraud and two counts of
making false statements to banks.
   No arraignment date has been set.
   Alito said Rough violated a position of ``great power, trust and
responsibility,'' and hoped the case would serve as a warning to
other would-be insider-traders of interest rate data.
   ``He abused that office in a very shocking and outrageous
manner,'' he said.
   Fed officials have called the discount rate one of their most
closely guarded secrets. The rate is widely regarded as an indicator
of the direction in which the Fed is seeking to push interest rates,
which affect the prices of bonds.
   Federal authorities were told by Bevill, Bresler principals of
the allegations against Rough during interviews shortly after the
firm's collapse.
   After the Fed learned of them, it stopped telling regional
federal reserves of its decision on the discount rate earlier in the
day than when it was announced publicly, said New York Fed spokesman
Peter Bakstansky.
   The indictment took so long because of the complex process of
examining Bevill, Bresler's brokerage operations, Alito said.
   He said the case was the first insider-trading scheme involving
the discount rate, and the first against a sitting member of a
federal reserve bank.
   Rough sat on the board as a representative of small banks in the
regional Fed's district.

   The prime time is at hand for a special brand of
holiday shopping that has become a tradition of sorts on Wall Street.
   Stock analysts and traders are busily combing the markets for
issues trading at or near their lowest levels of the year.
   The idea is to buy these stocks while they are artificially
depressed by yearend sell orders _ from individual investors looking
for tax writeoffs and from institutions clearing the losers out of
their portfolios before they make yearend reports to clients.
   Once the pressure of this selling is removed with the arrival of
the new year, the reasoning goes, these stocks stand a good chance
of rebounding, even if the financial affairs of the companies
involved don't change much.
   In his annual Stock Trader's Almanac, investment adviser Yale
Hirsch describes the list of stocks trading at new 52-week lows
around Dec. 15 as a menu for ``the only free lunch on Wall Street.''
   For most of the time in the past 15 years, according to Hirsch's
research, the New York Stock Exchange issues at new lows on Dec. 15
outperformed the NYSE composite index through the following Feb. 15.
   Last winter, for example, the 23 new lows posted an aggregate
gain of 13.2 percent over the two-month period, compared to a 6.8
percent rise for the NYSE index.
   Occasionally, however, the ``free lunch'' is more famine than
feast. The four new lows at mid-December 1985, which included three
energy-related issues, suffered an overall loss of 22.5 percent by
the next Feb. 15 as oil prices nosedived.
   In addition, small investors armed with limited capital face
problems turning this historical trend into a workable trading
strategy.
   Brokerage commissions take their considerable toll. And if a
trader doesn't have enough money to buy a diversified package of the
stocks at new lows, which ones to pick?
   The December bargain hunt does dovetail nicely with a phenomenon
known as the ``January effect'' that has been widely analyzed in
academic studies and at least one book.
   This research has documented a tendency for stocks, especially
those of smaller companies, to show unusual strength in the first
few weeks of the year.
   The only trouble with the January effect, analysts say, is the
very recognition it has received. Once market patterns become well
known, they often quickly change as traders try to capitalize on
them.
   Thus the suspicion among a good many Wall Streeters that the
January effect will soon be negated, or at least moved into December.
   Whether or not they prove to be ``bargains,'' many of the lists
of depressed stocks being published these days contain a surprising
number of big names.
   For example, at Oppenheimer & Co., analysts Norman Weinger and
Michael Metz ran a computer screen of stocks with market values of
at least $50 million, priced at no more than 10 percent above their
52-week lows, and carrying price-earnings multiples of no more than
10.
   The names that turned up included Digital Equipment, Xerox, Texas
Instruments, NCR and several technology issues that once ranked as
leading glamour stocks.
   Blue-chip industrial companies? How about DuPont, Goodyear and
Weyerhaueser, for starters.
   ``No investment decision is warranted on the basis of these
figures alone,'' Weinger and Metz cautioned. For a further
observation, they added: ``It is interesting to note how many stocks
are still down sharply'' in the aftermath of the October 1987 crash.

<HEAD>Say Another Drexel Trader Turns State's Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bond trader has
agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors probing the Wall Street
firm for possible securities fraud, the second employee to turn
state's evidence this week.
   Sources familiar with the Drexel case, who spoke on condition
they not be identified, confirmed a report Friday that Terren Pizer,
who worked on the bond trading desk at the firm's Beverly Hills
office, agreed late Wednesday to provide evidence in exchange for
immunity from prosecution.
   Pizer sat near Michael Milken, Drexel's high-yield bond financier
and a key target of the federal investigation that has lasted more
than two years, an outgrowth of the Ivan Boesky insider trading
scandal.
   Drexel, Milken and two other employees have been accused by the
Securities and Exchange Commission of conspiring with Boesky to
commit frauds that range from trading on inside information to stock
manipulation. Now imprisoned, Boesky has been the government's key
source of evidence in the case.
   A Manhattan federal grand jury has been investigating the firm on
similar grounds and has been expected to indict Drexel, Milken and
the others for months. The defendants have maintained their
innocence, although Drexel has been negotiating with prosecutors
about a possible settlement.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Pizer's cooperation
reflected a tougher negotiating stance by the government and
intensified pressure on Drexel to capitulate in order to avoid a
possibly devastating indictment that would include charges of
racketeering, which carry enormous fines.
   But it was unclear what, if any, incriminating material Pizer
could provide.
   Spokesmen for Drexel and Milken declined to comment on the
development. Aides to Manhattan U.S. attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani
also declined to comment in accordance with their policy of silence
on pending investigations.
   Pizer's agreement came one day after another key figure in the
investigation, Milken aide Cary Maultasch, struck a plea bargain
with prosecutors. But the effect of Maultasch's cooperation also
remains unclear.

   The stock market was mixed today amid what
analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.56 to 2,145.27 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Losers slightly outnumbered gainers in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 411 up, 452 down and 596
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.80 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that
investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings
before they make yearend reports to clients.
   At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for
yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes.
   Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to
discern any trends in the making for stock prices.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Eastman Kodak rose ] to 46[;
General Electric dropped \ to 46, and American Telephone & Telegraph

<TEXT>
   Salomon Inc. said it plans to shift $1.1 billion
from a Swiss subsidiary to its U.S. operations and take a $150
million tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings.
   The announcement Thursday marks a major restructuting of
Salomon's $3.6 billion capital and triggered some speculation that
the investment banking firm may be preparing a stock buyback or
major acquisition.
   Robert Salomon, a managing director, said the move would reduce
the capital of the Swiss unit to $600 million from $1.7 billion. He
said $750 million would be repatriated immediately and $350 million
at a later date.
   The company said it is taking the charge against earnings because
it had not set aside money to pay taxes on the additional income.
   Salomon said returning the foreign earnings to the United States
would give the company greater flexibility
   He said the move also would allow Salomon to use certain foreign
tax credits that expire at year's end. Foreign tax credits typically
allow firms to repatriate foreign earnings at a lower U.S. tax rate.
   Salomon's Zug, Switzerland, unit, the commercial financial
division, was established six years ago for tax purposes by Philipp
Brothers, a commodities firm that merged with Salomon.

<HEAD>Warners Loses Appeal in Lorimar Acquisition Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has upheld a lower court
ruling that blocked Warner Communications Inc.'s proposed $1.2
billion acquisition of Lorimar Telepictures Inc.
   However, Warner said it expected to complete the deal next month.
   The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court on Thursday
affirmed a decision that the merger violated a 1984 agreement
between Warner and its largest stockholder, Christ-Craft Industries
Inc., a broadcasting and manufacturing company.
   At issue in the case are Lorimar's televison stations.
Chris-Craft claimed in a suit filed in July that because Lorimar
owned six stations, the merger violated a 4-year-old pact
prohibiting Warner from owning any TV station so long as it owned 25
percent or more of Chris-Craft's BHC Inc. broadcasting subsidiary.
   Warner acquired a 42.5 percent stake in BHC in 1984 in exchange
for Chris- Craft getting 23 percent of Warner's voting stock.
   The appeals court upheld a a ruling that said Warner could not
acquire any Lorimar stock until the TV stations were sold or it
reduced its stake in BHC.
   But Warner said it was moving ahead despite the setback. ``We
have been working on alternatives and it is our intent to consummate
the transaction in January,'' the company said in a statement.
   Since the Chris-Craft suit was filed, Lorimar completed the sale
of television stations in Odessa, Texas; Springfield, Mo.; and
Redding, Calif., to a partnership that includes a former Lorimar
executive.
   It also reached an agreement in principle to sell a fourth
station in Pittsburgh, but two independent stations in Puerto Rico
remain on the auction block.
   Warner contends the proposed merger would not violate the
agreement with Chris-Craft because Warner planned to set up an
independent trust, pending approval from the Federal Communications
Commission, to run the remaining stations.

<HEAD>EEC Steel Production Will Steady In First Quarter Of 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The EEC Commission predicted Friday that
crude steel production in the 12-nation trade bloc would hold steady
at about 34 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1989.
   The prediction matched production estimates for this year's
fourth quarter and first quarter.
   The commission also said total production for 1988 should amount
to 135 million tons, up 8 percent from 1987.
   It said demand should remain firm at least through the first
quarter of 1989 and possibly through the first half, despite concern
over a build-up of stocks in some sectors and diminishing demand
from French and West German automobile industries.
   Export and import prices were rising, while export demand
remained high, the commission said.
   Consumption in the European Economic Community was expected to
remain roughly steady at 29.6 million tons in the first quarter of
1989. That compares with an estimated 29.8 million tons in the
fourth quarter of 1988 and 28.24 million tons in the first quarter
of 1988.

<HEAD>EEC Official Says Hormone Ban Will Go Into Effect</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Trade Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community said Friday that
a ban on the imports of hormone-treated meat from the United States
will go into effect next month.
   The ban, implementation of which was postponed for one year at
the request of the United States, could provoke a trade war with
Washington.
   EEC spokesman Nicolas Wegter also said the 12-nation EEC only
would agree to international arbitration of the dispute with the
United States if consumer-related arguments as well as scientific
ones are taken into account.
   The ban legislated by the EEC, which goes into effect Jan. 1,
would affect $170 million of U.S. meat exports. This does not
include about $72 million of horsemeat, which is not treated with
hormones.
   EEC and U.S. negotiators were expected to have an opportunity to
discuss possible solutions to the dispute when they met here this
week for a ministerial conference of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   But a U.S.-EEC clash over support for farmers prevented the
discussion from taking place. The matter will also not be taken up
at a bilateral meeting of ministers taking place in Brussels Friday
because the U.S. and EEC agriculture negotiators had to stay in
Montreal longer than expected and did not get to Belgium in time.
   ``We don't care what the Americans want for their consumers,''
said Wegter. ``Our legislation goes into effect and we will apply
it.''
   A European Parliament investigation of reports that European
farmers violate the legislation and treat their animals with
hormones will not affect implementation of the ban, he said.
   The council of the GATT, which oversees implementation of the
1947 treaty regulating world trade, is scheduled to meet Dec. 20 to
consider a U.S. request for establishing an arbitration pnel.
   Wegter said the EEC would only accept the arbitration panel if it
``doesn't rely just on scientific arguments but also on
consumer-related and other arguments.'' He said most EEC members
already had legislated bans on hormone-treated meat, ``and they
think it's good for their consumers.''
   The United States insists that hormones used on animals do not
leave residues that are harmful to humans. Some European scientists
have concurred, while others have argued that the hormones can cause
cancer.
   The United States could retaliate against the meat ban with one
of its own against European meat exports, which consist mostly of
high quality items like Danish ham.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade on pre-weekend profit-taking and
disappointment over the Agriculture Department's rejection of
China's bid for a large wheat shipment.
   The Chinese bid Wednesday for 400,000 of the 1 million metric
tons of U.S. wheat that exporters recently were authorized to sell
them at subsidized prices under the USDA's Export Enhancement
Program. The markets learned early today that the USDA had rejected
China's initial tender.
   ``But I am told they will rebid, so I don't think we'll lose very
much ground,'' said Dale Gustafson, a grain-market analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean prices were pressured by conflicting reports about the
amount of overnight rainfall in the South American soybean belt, he
said.
   Corn prices were mixed, with support stemming from strong cash
markets and a positive export outlook.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.28 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to 1\ cents higher with December at $2.58 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent lower with December at $2.11{ a bushel; soybeans

   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the

   U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
declared himself satisfied with Japan's role in internatonal trade
talks here and said he would reject a petition by American farmers
to demand access to the Japanese rice market.
   But a spokesman for the 12-nation European Economic Community,
Nicolas Wegter, said Friday that ``the Japanese didn't say one word
the entire week about agriculture.''
   Yeutter had told reporters that the Japanese delegation to the
ministeral meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
``performed superbly.'' ``They handled themselves skillfully,'' he
added. ``It was a first class performance.''
   Japan, the world's largest net importer of agricultural products,
sat in on six days of talks between the EEC, the United States and
the world's leading farm exporters.
   ``I didn't hear the translators translate one word from Japanese
into agriculture,'' Wegter told reporters.
   The divergence of views reflected attempts by the EEC and the
United States to curry Japan's favor in their battle over
agricultural subsidies.
   Yeutter, asked whether he would accept a petition by the U.S.
Rice Millers Association, responded, ``I will not.''
   Several weeks ago Yeutter rejected a petition by the American
rice producers' group which called on the U.S. government to
investigate whether Japan is employing unfair trade practices in
refusing to open its rice market to imports.
   In turning down the petition, Yeutter said he hoped the rice
question would be resolved in Montreal and if not the farmers could
resubmit their appeal.
   Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, concerned with the
veiled threat of U.S. pressure, sent a delegation to Montreal to
make sure the foreign ministry negotiators did not cave in to
demands on the rice issue.
   But much to Japan's relief, the subject was virtually not
mentioned during the six days of talks, which were dominated by the
U.S.-EEC clash on farm supports.
   The United States is seeking farm subsidy elimination, while the
EEC is only willing to cut down the supports. The talks ended in
stalemate.
   Japan said it did not take sides in the clash.
   ``Our position is that there is no point in making decisions
until they settle,'' said Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, Japan's director of
foreign press relations.
   Nishimura said that whatever the outcome, Japan's prime concern
is the protection of its rice market against foreign imports.
   The administration appears content to allow the rice issue to
rest as long as Japan leaves it on the table for future negotiations.
   Japanese rice is about four times more expensive than U.S. rice,
but Japan is insistent on complete self-reliance in production of
the staple crop.
   The Rice Millers were demanding a quota of up to 2.5 percent of
the Japanese market the first year, which would rise to 10 percent
in the fourth year.

<TEXT>
   Two men have been charged with attempted
extortion in a series of death threat letters sent to prominent
Antelope Valley citizens.
   Although the two unemployed aerospace workers are suspected of
sending 265 computer-printed threats, they were charged with only 10
specific acts to simplify the case, Deputy District Attorney Steve
Cooley said Thursday.
   ``Many of the letters were identical,'' said Cooley, but he noted
that the text of each letter was ``customized'' to include personal
information about the intended victims.
   Roman Stephan Makuch, 27, and Richard Mathew Faroni, 26, were
arrested in Las Vegas on Thanksgiving Day and waived extradition.
   Letters attached to the complaint began with an obscenity and a
death threat. The writers then demanded specific amounts of cash as
high as $600,000 with instructions for its delivery. They also gave
gruesome details of how victims would be killed, and threatened harm
to children, spouses and relatives of the letter recipients, Cooley
said.
   Those targeted by the letter writers, he said, were all
``substantial people'' including a former city manager of Lancaster,
lawyers, bank vice presidents, doctors, dentists, accountants and
real estate agents.
   None of them paid any money, he said.
   The letters, received Nov. 2-3, told some recipients to take a
citizens band radio to Las Vegas and tune in a specific channel for
instructions on where to deliver money.
   Cooley said a search of a Las Vegas apartment occupied by Makuch
and Faroni and a nearby storage facility turned up computer,
printers and computer discs, a handgun and several CB radios.
   He said acquaintances said about the pair: ``They could be
characterized as being a couple of oddballs, misfits.''
   Cooley added, ``there is some indication there may be other
people involved.''
   Makuch and Faroni were unemployed but had worked previously on
the assembly line at Rockwell International's Palmdale plant on the
B-1B bomber project, Cooley said.
   Both were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion, attempted
extortion and sending threatening letters for extortion purposes. If
convicted, Cooley said they could draw maximum sentences of six
years in prison.

<HEAD>The Year It Didn't Happen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the next few weeks the media will attempt to
wrap up the economic year, and one of their themes is likely to be
that 1988 was the year when it didn't happen.
   So much didn't happen that was expected to happen _ a secondary
shock wave in the stock market and a recession, for instance _ that
it carries a message for 1989.
   That message: Don't place too much faith in the seers, because
they really don't put all that faith in themselves. Many of the
stock market doomsayers, for example, reversed themselves last
summer and put their bets on stocks.
   Another school of economic sages based their forecast of
recession on the assumption that an expansion that had already gone
on for five years would have to stop for breath. Instead, the
expansion merely slowed and inhaled.
   Now, one year later, these seers are expressing the identical
doubts they had in 1987, and for the very same reasons. It is a
no-lose situation, because a recession that doesn't come can be
explained away as unexpectedly good news. And eventually, if not
now, they will be right; they'll let you know about it.
   Interest rates rose, but they didn't go through the roof. Prices
didn't run away. Housing didn't collapse. Cars had a good year. The
jobless rate continued to fall. Contrary to many forecasts, the
trade and budget deficits narrowed, too.
   The fact that these dire forecasts didn't materialize doesn't
mean it was a dull year. It wasn't a dull year, but the things that
made it exciting and unusual had very little to do with the
foresight of the seers.
   Do you recall any of them telling you that corporate takeovers
would reach such a frantic pace? Did anyone even conceive of a
company the size of RJR Nabisco being auctioned off?
   It is therefore wise in reviewing the forecasts to remember that
much of it is a game; when you win you get up on the roof and shout
and demonstrate, and when you're wrong you remain in your study and
guard your quiet dignity.
   Nothing can stop the forecasts; they'll be made, if only for
publicity purposes. The future, oddly, is an attractive place,
largely because it is the great unknown.
   Though it is a dark mystery, the future is where much of the
investment community seeks to reside. You make money by
anticipating, by getting in on things early, by beating others, by
buying before the news gets around.
   And so there will be forecasts. Stock market seers make them to
impress customers. Scholars sometimes make them because of
conviction, or probably to sell books. Market letter writers make
them because forecasts excite interest.
   But evidence that very few people really can foresee the future,
at least with any tiny degree of consistency, lies in the consensus
forecast, about which you will be reading plenty.
   The consensus forecast is the median forecast. It is the middle
range between extremes. The consensus is often right on the mark,
correctly estimating such items as inflation, interest rates and
gross national product.
   And when the consensus is on the mark it means, by definition,
that most of the forecasts it is made of are not on the mark.

   The second-ranking executive at Beecham
Products USA, maker of Aqua-Fresh toothpaste, Sucrets lozenges,
Geritol vitamins and Williams Lectric Shave lotion, resigned in a
move that could influence where the headquarters will be located.
   The exit of Robert M. Lancaster as executive vice president for
sales and marketing followed a proposed corporate realignment that
eliminates his position.
   The British parent, Beecham Group PLC, intends to merge Beecham
USA with its other U.S. subsidiary, Norcliff-Thayer of Tarrytown,
N.Y., maker of Tums antacids and Oxy acne medications.
   Lancaster, a 15-year veteran of the company, favored keeping
Beecham USA in Pittsburgh, where 400 employees oversee
administration, sales, marketing, research and customer services.
   Lancaster's boss, President Charles Pergola, wanted the issue to
be decided by a study that also is determining the best way to carry
out the merger.
   ``Having been through the changes we've been through, it isn't
unusual for people in this position to have philosophical
disagreements,'' Maurice L. Kelley, vice president for sales and
marketing, said Thursday.
   Lancaster joined the company as national accounts manager while
it was part of Merck & Co. Merck sold the business to Beecham in
1977.
   Beecham undertook the study in September shortly after Pergola
became Beecham USA's third president in three years.
   The company spent $10 million two years ago constructing a
95,000-square-foot headquarters building outside Pittsburgh in
Kennedy Township.

<TEXT>
   Share prices finished lower on London's Stock
Exchange Friday, but above their worst levels, lifted by a strong
trend on Wall Street and the start of a new trading account.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 7.6
points, or 0.4 percent, lower at 1,750.3, well above the day's low
of 20 points off. However the market never recovered to its best
level of 3.6 points up.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 7.7 points lower at
1,429.4.
   Volume was a moderate 637.1 million shares up from 543.8 million
shares a day earlier.
   Dealers said the market remained preoccupied through most of the
trading session by the prospects for higher interest rates
worldwide, focusing on Friday on unconfirmed rumors that West German
interest rates may be increased next week.
   The interest rate worries about Germany added to the market's
longstanding concern about the effect on British corporate
profitability of recent British base lending rate increases.
   But toward the close, a strong trend on Wall Street, and the 3:30
p.m. start of a new trading account lifted the market from its lows
toward the close.
   The exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week periods
for accounting purposes.
   The Financial Times 500-share index fell 6.24 points to 981.56 at
the close.

<HEAD>Spain Approves Railway System Overhaul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spain on Friday adopted Europe's standard
width for railroad tracks, a step that will allow trains to roll
directly into western Europe for the first time since track was laid
133 years ago.
   The move clears the way for completion of high-speed train links
with Europe by 1992, when Spain hosts the Summer Olympics and
celebrates the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery
of the New World.
   The government next week is expected to award a major contract to
build Spain's first high-speed train system. French, West German and
Japanese firms are bidding for the deal.
   The first phase of the changeover to the narrower European tracks
would permit construction of a high-speed line from Port Bou on
Spain's northern border with France to Barcelona, Madrid and Seville.
   By the turn of the century, the 5.5-foot-wide Spanish and
Portuguese tracks would be replaced with 4.7-foot-wide track used in
10 other European Economic Community nations.
   Transport Minister Jose Barrionuevo said the France-to-Seville
line should be ready by the opening of Seville's World Expo in
spring 1992 to commemorate the Columbus anniversary and the 1992
Barcelona Summer Olympics.
   The government also ordered the state rail company, RENFE, to
study replacing the rest of the country's 7,887 miles of rail track
by 2001.
   It is widely believed that Spanish railways were given a narrower
gauge than the rest of Europe when first built in 1855 to make a
military invasion of the Iberian peninsula more difficult.
   Engineers maintained that a wider gauge was necessary to
accommodate locomotives that carried trains across Spain's
mountainous terrain.
   Now, wheels on railway cars from Spain and Portugal must be
changed or modified at the Spanish-French border.

<HEAD>Shultz Says U.S. Right In Meat Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
said Friday that ``we're right'' in opposing the European Economic
Community's planned ban on hormone-treated meat from the United
States.
   Shultz told reporters the meat the United States wants to send to
European buyers ``is very acceptable.''
   ``There is no health problem involved as we see it,'' he said
after meeting with officials of the 12-nation Common Market trade
bloc.
   In Montreal, a spokesman for the European Community, Nico Wegter,
said the ban would take effect Jan. 1 as scheduled.
   ``We don't care what the Americans want for their consumers,''
Wegter said. ``Our legislation goes into effect, and we will apply
it.''
   The EEC wants to ban for health reasons all meat from animals
treated with growth hormones. Late last year, it agreed to delay
implementation of the prohibition until 1989.
   The United States had threatened to take retaliatory action
against the ban. It maintains that the use of hormones to fatten
animals, a common practice among American farmers, is not a health
risk.
   An estimated $170 million in U.S. meat exports would be affected
by the ban.
   Shultz said the value of meat exports to the EEC is small
compared to this year's estimated $166 billion two-way trade between
the United States and the trading bloc. But, he said, ``It's large
to the people involved.''
   He acknowledged a difference of opinion with the community, but
said, ``We think we're right.''
   Shultz met with European Community President Jacques Delors and
other top trade officials.
   The talks were held as international trade negotiations in
Montreal were postponed for four months over a stalemate between the
United States and the Common Market over phasing out agricultural
subsidies.
   The United States is pressing Europe to agree to eliminate
subsidies it claims distort international trade by supporting
cut-rate exports and restricting imports.
   The Europeans argue they have taken steps to control farm
spending and could only agree to reduce the subsidies _ not scrap
them altogether.
   ``There is a general recognition that the system of subsidies to
agriculture has got itself structured wrong and is altogether too
costly,'' Shultz said.
   He said the subsidies cost the United States, Japan and the
Common Market an estimated $200 billion a year.
   ``There are big stakes involved, economic stakes and political
stakes, and that's the reason why people are so intense about it,''
he said.
   Shultz's discussions concluded a two-day trip to Brussels
primarily for a meeting with other foreign ministers of the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monson Trucking, a highly profitable family
business that prides itself on a glistening fleet of modern rigs,
has been crippled by the first drivers' strike in its 73-year
history.
   The walkout will enter its second week Sunday, keeping 125
Teamsters in the Midwest jobless and neutralizing Monson's 24-state
distribution network, which revolves around the shipment of
newsprint from Ontario.
   Both sides say the dispute is fueled by years of bad blood
between Monson and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
   ``They are considered to be one of the most corrupt organizations
in the United States,'' company President Robert Monson said of the
international union. ``Why should you want to deal with them?
   ``The Teamsters never have been and never will be welcomed
here,'' he added.
   Sherman Liimatainen, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Union Local
346, said Monson is the most anti-union employer of the 330
companies he has had to deal with as an officer of Local 346.
   ``For a company that displays a white-horse image out there, it's
fair to say that horse has spots on it,'' Liimatainen said. `His
(Monson's) total approach is, `You guys are people I'm going to
dictate to.'
   ``Any time anyone asserted their rights in this union, they (the
company) had a way of intimidating them,'' he said.
   Despite a threat that they would be permanently replaced if they
struck, by midweek only a handful of drivers had crossed the picket
line in front of company headquarters along windswept Highway 61 on
Lake Superior's north shore, union officials said.
   The company ordered them to return to work last Monday.
   Monson said Wednesday the company intends to hire permanent
replacements until it is `back to full strength.''
   Striking driver Bill Miller, a union steward, said he knew of
only four replacement hirings.
   Monson said Monday he was considering options which included
renewing contract talks with Local 346 of Duluth and Local 160,
which covers employees at Monson's Red Wing terminal. On Wednesday,
however, he said he didn't see any reason to return to the
bargaining table.
   Liimatainen said Wednesday no new talks were set. He said three
mediated negotiating sessions were held before the company's
three-year contract proposal was rejected by 99 percent of voting
union members. The previous two-year contract expired Nov. 26.
   Miller and fellow union steward John Deterling said the two sides
are not far apart on benefits and could possibly work out a deal on
the chief wage issue, mileage pay.
   Under the expired contract, Monson truckers were paid 23.5 cents
a mile. At the average rate of 2,500 miles a week, drivers made
about $30,500 a year under the old contract, with Monson paying for
fuel and maintenance on the trucks.
   According to the company's latest offer, the mileage rate would
increase to 25 cents a mile over three years.
   Miller and Deterling said truckers want wages of 26 cents a mile,
the amount they were paid before the industry was deregulated.
Monson said he stopped trying to negotiate when he was told ``there
would be no contract'' unless the mileage rate was increased by 3
cents.
   ``They're already above industry standards,'' he said of the
wages.
   Miller and Deterling said their top priority in negotiating a new
contract is job security, not wages.
   Work rules under the old contract made it too easy for the
company to discriminate against active union members, they said.
   They want to alter the company's disciplinary point system, under
which drivers accumulate points for accidents, speeding and other
traffic violations. A total of 35 points in a year could lead to a
driver's dismissal under the expired contract.
   Deterling, 55, said he was fired in 1984 when he was assessed 35
points for an accident. He said the company offered to rehire him
with no seniority and less vacation pay, but he declined. With the
union's help, he recovered his job and seniority level.
   Several employees who were not as active in the union agreed to
be fired and rehired with a loss of seniority after accumulating
more than 35 points in a year, Deterling said.
   Monson would not comment on the point system and other rule
changes sought by the union, including proposed changes in the
grievance policy. But he said the company has never discriminated
against union members or anyone else.
   The company delivers newsprint from mills in Ontario to
newspapers in the United States and ships ``anything from soup to
nuts'' on return trips, Miller said.
   The 24-state territory ranges from Ohio to Idaho and as far south
as Alabama and Texas.
   According to documents filed with the Interstate Commerce
Commission, Monson booked $1 million in net operating income for the
first six months of the year on sales of $8.4 million.

   Wheat and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower while most corn and oat futures advanced slightly in subdued
trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts attributed the declines to profit-taking and positioning
ahead of the weekend.
   They said wheat also fell on disappointment that the Agriculture
Department had rejected China's bid for 400,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   Soybeans came under additional pressure from mixed forecasts for
the weekend weather in the South American soybean belt, analysts
said.
   ``Two (private) forecasters were predicting rain and another one
said it wasn't going to rain so they've got some confusion going in
the beans,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst with the G.H. Miller
futures trading division of LIT America Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn futures were buoyed by expectations for increased export
sales, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $4.27 a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to 2} cents higher with December at $2.59{; oats were 2
cents to 3} cents higher with December at $2.05} a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents lower to 1{ cents higher with January at $7.73 a bushel.

   The stock market showed a slight gain today amid
what analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and
selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.14 to 2,143.85 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 737 up, 641 down and
563 unchanged.
   Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that
investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings
before they make yearend reports to clients.
   At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for
yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes.
   Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to
discern any trends in the making for stock prices.
   Rite Aid tumbled 3} to 31. The company estimated a 20 percent
decline in earnings for the fiscal quarter that ended Nov. 26.

<HEAD>Is the Yield Curve Changing Course?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the world of credit, ``short'' is most
definitely in fashion these days, at least from an investor's
standpoint.
   Yields on some bills and notes, particularly in the Treasury
market, have nearly equaled or surpassed those on longer maturing
bonds more so now than at any other time this year. That makes it
far more sensible to hold onto the shorter securities.
   Usually it's the other way around. Long-term rates often are
significantly higher to compensate investors for their increased
risk.
   For instance, it's more likely that someone will renege on a
30-year debt than on one lasting three months. There's also
increased risk of higher interest rates, which depress a bond's
price, and higher inflation, which reduce its real value.
   But now the so-called yield curve, which illustrates the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates, appears to
be changing. Normally in an upward, or ``J'' position, the curve,
which has been flat for most of the year, looks close to inverting.
   By midday Friday, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year
bond stood at 8.96 percent, lower than the yields of all other bonds
and notes of lesser maturities. The 20-year bond was yielding 9.02
percent; the 10-year, 9.01 percent; the four-year, 9.00 percent; and
the two-year, 8.99 percent.
   Treasury bill yields remained a bit lower, however. A quick
measure of the curve is the relationship between the three-month
bill and the 30-year bond. By Friday afternoon the long bond was
0.79 percentage points higher than the bill. The gap, though, was
closing in on the one-year bill, which was yielding 8.90 percent.
   When the yield curve is in a positive, upward steep the long bond
is usually between 1{- to 2 percentage points higher in yield.
   The yield curve theoretically should reflect the expectations of
borrowers and investors. One that ascends steeply indicates that the
markets expect interest rates and inflation to rise; it also
portrays ``easy'' money.
   The last time the curve inverted was around 1981. The stock
market fell into a slump as a result and the nation headed into a
recession.
   Market watchers aren't sure what the current movement of rates
means.
   Jay Goldinger, a principal at the Beverly Hills, Calif.,
investment banking firm Capital Insight Inc., said he expects the
yield curve to continue to invert but that the economy shouldn't
suffer as a result.
   ``What it (the inversion) really means is inflation expectations
in this country continue to be reduced as the Fed has done a good
job of tightening'' credit, Goldinger said.
   ``This is nothing unusual. We have an inverted yield curve in
England and in Australia,'' he explained. ``The central banks of
this world really pay attention in focusing in on inflation fears.''
   Marshall B. Front, an economist at the Chicago investment firm
Stein Roe & Farnham, predicted that rates might be heading lower
soon because the economy is showing signs of slowing down.
   While short-term rates certainly are attractive now _ not just in
Treasuries, but in things like certificates of deposits or money
market accounts _ Front says he's gradually sinking his money into
longer-maturing securities.
   ``Our own guess is that we're fairly close to a peak in
short-term rates. We could see a decline in rates before the end of
the first quarter,'' Front said.
   If that happens, then bond prices will head higher.
   ``We don't think we'll have a repeat of the last few cycles where
you had a sharply inverted yield curve,'' Front said.

<HEAD>Soybean Market Looks South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As winter settles into the Windy City, soybean
traders on the Chicago Board of Trade are looking to the south with
more than vacations in mind.
   It's springtime in Brazil and Argentina, respectively the world's
second-and fourth-largest soybean producers, and a dry spell during
the South American planting period could prove to be the seedling of
another drought rally in the soybean market.
   ``It's sort of analagous to what happened here in the Midwest in
May or June,'' said James Candor, senior forecaster with
Accu-Weather Inc., a private meteorological information service in
State College, Pa.
   ``There's still time for the crop to recover if it turns rainy,''
he said. ``But if it stays this dry for the rest of this month into
early January, then problems will really start to mount.''
   Other experts say the South American weather could stay dry into
late January with no significant damage to the soybean crop, and the
plants won't enter their most critical growth phase until
mid-February.
   But soybean futures traders are scrambling for every available
scrap of South American weather information and a recent upswing in
prices reflects the generally bullish outlook.
   Soybeans for delivery in March on the Chicago Board of Trade hit
a recent low of $7.42{ a bushel on Nov. 18. On Friday, the contract
settled at $7.85\.
   No one is predicting a return to the highs near $11 a bushel
reached in July on panic buying linked to the Midwestern drought.
   But, said Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations for
Balfour Maclaine Corp., ``if South American production falters
because of weather _ and nobody has that answer yet _ prices could
go up by $1 to $1.50 bushel over next several months.''
   The U.S. soybean market has grown more sensitive to the status of
the South American crop in the last 10 years as South American
production has expanded to satisfy the world's increasing appetite
for protein.
   In 1981, Brazil produced about 470 million bushels of soybeans
and Argentina grew about 154 million bushels. Last month, the
Agriculture Department estimated Brazil's soybean output for the
1988-89 season at the equivalent of 734 million bushels and
Argentina's at 404 million bushels.
   The United States is the world's largest producer with this
year's output estimated at 1.51 billion bushels. But that figure
represents a 21 percent decline from the 1987 U.S. harvest, and the
nation's surplus stockpile is expected to dwindle by the end of
August to a scant 125 million bushels as a result.
   Because of the sharp reduction in U.S. supplies, ``the South
American weather this year has probably become the most important in
history as far as soybeans are concerned,'' said Charles Notis, a
founding partner of Freese-Notis Weather Inc. in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Soybean traders say the South American weather information
available from private forecasters varies greatly from one
meteorological firm to another and seems less reliable than U.S.
weather data.
   The private forecasters say those problems often stem from their
difficulty in getting data from the weather services run by South
American governments.
   ``It seems that quite often when it rains down there, for some
reason they don't like to report what happened, how much rain
fell,'' Notis said. ``Their regular reporting stations sometimes
don't report.''
   Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services Corp.
in New Bedford, Mass., said the information his firm receieves
through official channels sometimes comes in garbled or just plain
wrong.
   ``Last week Campo Grande (the location of a Brazilian reporting
station) transmitted 24-hour precipitation of 92 millimeters but it
actually received only 0.2 millimeters,'' Leavitt said. ``That's the
difference between 3.6 or 3.7 inches and a trace.''
   So private forecasters rely heavily on data from weather
satellites. And even though satellite accuracy fades the farther you
get from the equator, ``satellites don't lie,'' Notis said.
   Private forecasters were hesitant to make long-range predictions
about South America's soybean weather. But Leavitt cited a cooling
of ocean surface temperatures, which he called the ``La Nina''
effect, the inverse of the better-known ``El Nino.''
   La Nina is typically associated with dry-weather years in the
Southern Hemisphere, he said.
   ``There are very strong La Nina signals this year, and that's
more likely to give you a crop problem in South America,'' he said.

<HEAD>GEC and Siemens To Delay Formal Offer For Plessey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG said Friday
they would delay their 1.7 billion-pound, or $3.1 billion, joint bid
for the British electronics firm Plessey Co. PLC pending a high
court hearing late next week.
   Plessey on Thursday obtained a preliminary injunction from the
High Court blocking the offer before a full court hearing on whether
the bid infringes on the anti-competition provisions of the Treaty
of Rome.
   Plessey said the injunction was dropped by the court on Friday
after GEC and Siemens pledged not to pursue their bid before the
full hearing. The matter is now likely to come before the court next
Thursday and Friday, Plessey said.
   GEC, a British company, which is not related to the U.S. company
of the same name, said it intends to contest Plessey's arguments.
   Siemens is a West German concern.
   Plessey argued that the GEC-Siemens bid is anti-competitive and
illegal and allegedly contravenes the anti-trust provisions of the
Treaty of Rome, the European Community's founding charter.
   The EC commission is also investigating the bid, but has not yet
announced its decision.

<HEAD>Deficit Panel Cancels Meeting After Judge Says It Must Be Public</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan commission appointed to study ways
to reduce the federal budget deficit Friday canceled its next
meeting after a judge barred the panel from closing the proceedings
to the public.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green prompted the
National Economic Commission to cancel Monday's meeting at which it
was to review budget options and discuss which economic assumptions
would be used to make recommendations for deficit reduction.
   ``It is evident in this case that the public has the right to
know the issues at discussion as they develop at the December 12
meeting,'' Green ruled in granting a temporary restraining order
barring a closed proceeding.
   ``The meeting is canceled,'' commission spokesman Jim Hildreth
said following Green's decision. ``We were challenged and we will
abide by the court. Where we will go from here, we simply don't
know.''
   The commission has no other scheduled meetings this month and had
only discussed tentative dates for discussions in January, Hildreth
said.
   The judge ruled that news organizations that brought the case
would likely ultimately be able to prove that closed meetings
violate the Federal Advisory Commission Act and the Sunshine Act.
   ``The commission's insistence on shielding the debate as to
budget options from public scrutiny directly contravenes the law,''
Green wrote in an opinion.
   ``It chops the core of our democratic society: open robust,
unvarnished public debate illuminating pressing issues, concerns and
policies that affect the lives of all citizens,'' she said.
   The judge rejected the commission's arguments that because the
panel's members were so prestigious, their public discussions of
various economic options could wreak havoc with the financial
markets.
   ``The expressions to be presented by these officials are no
different than the plethora of economic assessments and predictions
(some optimistic, some grave) that inundate the public daily,''
Green said.
   While such discussion may result in speculation on financial
markets, the effect ``must be balanced against the open society and
unfettered public debate on important national issues upon which our
democracy is founded,'' the judge said.
   A closed meeting would more likely encourage speculation, he
said, adding: ``Fear flourishes when the process is shrouded in a
cloak of secrecy and the swiftest transport to speculation is fear.''
   The lawsuit challenging the closed meeting was filed by The
Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the Bureau of National
Affairs, which publishes financial newsletters, and Stephen
Wildstrom, an editor for Business Week.
   Public Citizen, a consumer organization founded by Ralph Nader,
represented the news organizations and also joined in the case.
   In a statement, Public Citizen's president, Joan Claybrook, said:
``The idea that the members of this commission are too prestigious
to air their views in public is outrageous, and an affront to our
open system of government.''

<HEAD>Wall Street, Investors Weigh Unbundled Stock Units</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's latest financial product, the
unbundled stock unit, is being touted as a way for top-quality
companies to unlock the hidden values in their shares without having
to dismantle the company.
   But the proposal has also unleashed a torrent of questions from
investors and money managers trying to figure if there is anything
in it for them.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which developed the proposal
embraced by four major companies earlier this week, has created a
product that splits a stock into three components _ a 30-year bond,
a preferred stock and a stock appreciation certificate.
   American Express Co., Sara Lee Corp., Dow Chemical Co. and Pfizer
Inc. have filed documents with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to offer their shareholders a chance to swap up to $5.6
billion in stock for new securities.
   While the SEC reviews the filings, money managers are trying to
figure how the new securities will work, what they will be worth and
whether there will be be enough of them that there will be a ready
buyer when a holder wants to sell.
   While their inventors say they were not intended as a takeover
defense, some investors say they may have that effect. Critics say
the tax savings for issuers inherent in the plans may invite
congressional scrutiny.
   Jim Rogers, a professional investor and professor of finance at
Columbia University's graduate school of business, said the new
securities are ``a waste of time ... I don't see what's in it for
most people.''
   ``The question you have to ask yourself is do we really need
another piece of paper to maintain our capital system,'' said David
Dreman, director of a money management firm that bears his name.
   But Ron Gallatin, the Shearson executive who oversaw the
invention of unbundled stock units, said they will be useful for
major companies with credit ratings strong enough to absorb some
modest increases in debt.
   He said they are designed to highlight the three reasons people
buy stock _ the chance for a price increase, the dividend and the
possibility that the dividend will be raised.
   The 30-year bond will pay interest equal to the current annual
dividend. The preferred stock would pay any increase over the next
30 years in the current level of the dividend. The stock
appreciation certificate would entitle the holder to buy a share of
the company's stock in 30 years for a pre-set price expected to be
slightly higher than the face value of the bond.
   Investors making the swap would be protected against a dividend
reduction, since the dividend would become a fixed interest payment.
   But some investment managers wonder how liquid the market for the
new securities will be.
   ``You'll only be able to determine that when they come out,''
said Charles Minter, a partner in the investment advisory firm
Comstock Partners.
   Gallatin conceded that since the exchange of stock for an
unbundled unit would be taxable, the units should appeal mainly to
tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds.
   Those making the exchange would also give up their voting rights,
a development that some analysts suspect management would like.
   ``If you remove 20 percent of the stock from the market, you
could end up with a higher percentage in friendly hands,'' said
Kenneth Heebner, a portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Co. in
Boston.
   From the issuer's standpoint, the security may be especially
attractive to companies that feel undervalued, have little debt and
want to avoid the heavy borrowing that would be needed to buy back
stock for cash.
   This is particularly attractive at a time when many American
managers see other companies succumbing to takeovers at prices far
in excess of market values. The publisher Macmillan Inc., foodmaker
Kraft Inc. and food and tobacco giant RJR Nabisco Inc. have all
fallen prey in recent months to takeover offers at a huge premiums
to their stock prices.
   The swaps would have a mixed financial impact on an issuer,
however.
   On the one hand, the company loses the flexibility of being able
to reduce its costs in bad times. It can always cut a dividend but
not interest payments. But the company would save on taxes since
interest payments are deductible while dividends are not.
   ``This plays into the hands of those in Congress who say debt has
become a device for avoiding taxes,'' said James Ullman, trustee of
Batterymarch Financial Management.
   A staffer on the House Ways and Means Committee, speaking on
condition that he not be identified by name, said the panel has
taken no position on whether to investigate the uses of the
unbundled stock unit, and said whether it does so may depend on how
many companies use it.
   The one clear winner in all this, investment managers say, will
be the underwriters who get a fee for handling the exchanges and the
brokers who will get commissions on executing trades involving all
of the new products.
   ``It is a reflection of the battered shape of Wall Street,'' said
Batterymarch's Ullman.

   Here is a capsule description of an unbundled
stock unit, a new type of security developed by Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc.
   Four major companies _ American Express Co., Sara Lee Corp.,
Pfizer Inc. and Dow Chemical Co. _ have announced plans, subject to
federal review, to exchange up to $5.6 billion of their stock for
unbundled stock units.
   The new securities consist of:
   _A 30-year bond that pays interest equal to the current stock
dividend and carrying a face value payable in 2019 higher than the
current stock price.
   Under the preliminary proposal, for instance, American Express's
bond would pay 84 cents a year in interest and have a face value of
$75. American Express stock was trading at $26.87{ the last trading
day before the proposal.
   _A share of preferred stock that will entitle the holder to any
dividends declared by the company in excess of the current dividend.
For American Express, that would be anything above 84 cents a year.
The preferred share could also be redeemed in 2019 for a nominal
price expected to be $2.
   _A stock appreciation certificate that will give the holder the
right to purchase for cash a share of the company's stock in 2019
for the principal amount of the bond plus the preferred share. In
the American Express example, that would be $77.
   It is expected that, subject to appropriate approvals, the
unbundled stock unit, each of its parts and a security that combines
the preferred share and the stock appreciation certificate would be
traded on the New York Stock Exchange, just as the company's stock.

   The stock market inched ahead today amid what
analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and selling.
   Trading was fairly quiet.
   Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that
investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings
before they make yearend reports to clients.
   At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for
yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes.
   Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to
discern any trends in the making for stock prices.

<HEAD>Trade Talks End With Only Tentative Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World trade talks ended inconclusively Friday,
with tentative gains in many areas but no sign of compromise on the
critical issue of farm supports.
   ``I suppose we could say it's a semi-success,'' said John
Crosbie, minister of international trade for host Canada.
   Trade ministers agreed to postpone final action until the first
week in April, hoping a way will be found in the meantime to break a
deadlock between the United States and European Economic Community
over agriculture.
   Top officials from 103 nations _ including 90 trade ministers _
came to Montreal to prod along the four-year Uruguay Round of
free-trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   This is the most ambitious round of free-trade talks since
formation of the GATT after World War II, and negotiators are
discovering deep sensitivities over agriculture, which had been
largely exempted from scrutiny until now.
   The four-month delay in the so-called midterm review of the
Uruguay Round meant that progress was frozen in 11 areas of
tentative agreement, including important ones such as freeing trade
in services and monitoring nations' trade policies.
   Arthur Dunkel, the director general of the GATT, will seek to
bridge differences over the next four months in the four remaining
areas: agriculture, protection of intellectual property, textile
tariffs and quotas, and escape clauses from GATT rules.
   Dunkel expressed optimism that he could persuade the American and
European negotiators to yield by appealing to their guilty
consciences over the impasse on agriculture.
   ``When people have bad conscience it's a good start to make a
deal,'' he said in a news conference.
   The farm deadlock had threatened to derail the entire
negotiations because some nations that depend on farm exports had
warned they would withhold approval of the other agreements unless
they got some progress on agriculture.
   The nations that demanded progress in all areas included
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay, Hungary and New
Zealand.
   The United States demanded a commitment by all nations to the
eventual elimination of trade-distorting farm subsidies and
barriers, while the EEC said it was willing to cut but not eliminate
such programs.
   The United States said it would not discuss short-term measures
until it got a commitment on the long-term goal, while the EEC said
it would not discuss a long-term goal until short-term measures had
been agreed upon.
   These were some of the tentative accords reached in Montreal,
subject to approval in April:
   _ Import tariffs on most goods would be cut by at least the 30
percent achieved in the last GATT round, which ended in 1979. The
significance of tariff cuts has diminished somewhat along with the
rise in non-tariff barriers.
   _ Trade in services would be liberalized, although developing
nations would be allowed to give their service industries some kind
of extra protection. Sectors to be covered would be decided by May
1989.
   _ To speed up settlement of disputes, all GATT reports on
disputes would have to be completed within 15 months unless the
parties agreed to an extension.
   _ The United States would be permitted to take trade retaliation
outside the GATT rules even if a GATT proceeding on its complaint
was under way.
   _ The legality of countries' trade policies would be reviewed
every two years for the United States, Canada, Japan and EEC
countries; every four years for 16 other countries; and as needed
for all other GATT members.
   _ The GATT's director general would be instructed to seek closer
ties to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and report
back by September 1989.
   _ Developed countries would lower barriers to imports of tropical
products such as coffee, bananas and rubber from developing nations.
   The EEC said Friday it would go ahead with its concessions on
tropical products and eliminate tariffs on imports from some of the
world's poorest countries without waiting for the April meeting.

<TEXT>
   While Mikhail Gorbachev soothed world tensions
with some suave diplomacy in New York, Americans were taking a
tougher approach at trade talks in Montreal and ruffling feathers.
   In fact, U.S. negotiators at the free-trade negotiations this
past week were less yielding than a Montreal Canadiens goaltender,
demanding a commitment by all nations to total elimination of
trade-distorting farm subsidies and barriers.
   They didn't get what they wanted. And by pressing that single
demand relentlessly, they jeopardized progress on other trade issues
that are dear to Americans, such as getting developing nations to
honor U.S. copyrights and patents.
   Meanwhile, Gorbachev was winning worldwide applause as a
peacemaker with his announcement of plans to cut Soviet armed forces
by 500,000 worldwide and pull back 10,000 tanks from Eastern Europe.
   The irony was that in both cases, perception was the biggest
element of the story.
   In the hubbub over Gorbachev's initiative, it was little noted
that Warsaw Pact forces would continue to vastly outnumber NATO
forces in Europe, or that Gorbachev's hand was forced by the crisis
in his own overstretched economy.
   Likewise, the United States came across as a bad guy in the
Montreal trade talks even though its goal _ eradicating farm
subsidies _ was a popular one.
   Among other things, eliminating the subsidies would save money
and cut food bills for U.S. and European taxpayers while allowing
developing nations to generate an extra $26 billion a year in
agricultural exports.
   The ultimate success of the U.S. tactics remains to be seen. It
could yet turn out that an unyielding U.S. stand was exactly what
was needed to force the Europeans into getting serious about cutting
farm programs.
   ``Agriculture is too important to simply nibble at the edges of
reform,'' Clayton Yeutter, the hard-charging U.S. trade
representative, told delegates from 103 nations in his closing
statement Friday.
   But whatever the possible long-term gains, the only immediate
effects of the U.S. unwillingness to discuss short-term measures
without agreement on a long-term goal were these:
   _ No agreements were reached on cutting expensive farm programs.
   _ Chances increased that the U.S. Congress would approve new
export subsidies in what could become an escalating conflict with
the Europeans.
   _ Developing nations were embittered by the stalemate, which
deprived them of gains they had hoped to make in freer farm exports.
   _ In retaliation, a bloc of developing nations managed to prevent
final adoption of agreements in other areas, such as freer trade in
services.
   The United States probably could have gotten farther if it had
been willing to compromise, says Gerard Nierenberg, a New York-based
negotiation expert who admits he is no expert on world trade.
   ``There's an old theory that if you make the first concession in
a negotiation you show your weakness, but that's not true,'' said
Nierenberg.
   To him, Exhibit No. 1 of the value of unilateral concessions is
Gorbachev's troop reduction announcement at the United Nations.
   ``They took what they had to do and made it to their advantage.
What does 95 percent of the world think? That Gorbachev is a
peacemaker.''
   Similarly, U.S. negotiators could have come across as peacemakers
on trade if they had announced some cut in farm subsidies and
invited other countries to follow suit for the good of all,
Nierenberg said.
   Everybody wins in a good negotiation, said Nierenberg, the author
of 14 books and the president of the Negotiation Institute.
   That view from an admitted novice on farm trade happens to go
along with pleadings this past week by Barber Conable, head of the
World Bank, and Michel Camdessus, head of the International Monetary
Fund.
   According to a new IMF report, nations can benefit by cutting
farm subsidies even if others do not immediately follow suit, so it
makes sense to go first.
   The IMF report is somewhat politically naive: It is hard to
expect American farmers to relinquish export markets, even
temporarily, without a fight.
   The United States is tired of making concessions that aren't
matched, Daniel Amstutz, the chief U.S. farm negotiator, said in a
news conference.
   ``Over 40 years we have learned that the rest of the world has
not followed suit .... So, no more.''
   Where the Americans erred, Nierenberg believes, was in feeling
that the goal of free farm trade justified the means of stonewalling.
   ``We can have glamorous ends, but if we ignore the means to these
ends we're never going to get anything,'' Nierenberg said.
   ``Hanging tough is not an achievement; coming up with creative
solutions is.''

Carrier</HEAD>

   Eastern Airlines on Friday denied speculation that a
move to break up the sales force it shares with Continential
Airlines is intended to do anything but sell more tickets.
   ``It has absolutely nothing to do with anything except better
customer service and selling our core markets to the public,'' said
Cori Zywotow, Eastern manager of corporate communications marketing.
   But labor officials said there may be other reasons for the move
to separate the two carriers' sales forces, which were combined
after Texas Air Corp. bought both airlines.
   ``It may indicate the company is being readied for sale,'' said
J.B. Stokes, a spokesman for Eastern's Air Line Pilots Association.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo has insisted the money-losing
airline is not for sale. But speculation increased after real estate
magnate Donald Trump negotiated to buy Eastern's most profitable
division, the Northeast shuttle linking Washington, New York and
Boston, for $365 million cash.
   Eastern lost about $234 million in the first nine months of the
year and has laid off about 3,500 employees in recent months.
   Other union officials speculated that the sales change may be an
attempt by Texas Air to keep Miami-based Eastern and Houston-based
Continental from being declared one carrier for labor representation
purposes. The National Mediation Board has been addressing that
matter in hearings since last summer.
   Eastern-Continental Sales was formed when the operations were put
together to improve efficiency. Its representatives called on travel
agents, promoting group packages, charters and special fares offered
by the two carriers.
   ``This was one of the things where we had great consternation
when we did it,'' Joseph Leonard, Eastern's executive vice president
and chief operating officer, said Thursday. ``We have felt, and the
sales people have told us this, that it's very difficult to sell two
products.''
   Lorenzo says the carriers are independent and he has no plans to
merge them. He turned the chairmanship of Continental over to D.
Joseph Corr, former president of Trans World Airlines, earlier this
week.
   The present sales team will be split in half, Leonard said. Each
will be based at its carrier's headquarters.
   Eastern salespeople will report to Stan Brown, vice president of
passenger sales. Brown will report to Eastern vice president of
marketing George Brennan.
   ``It's really going back and concentrating our energies on
Eastern and emphasizing our sales programs and distinctive
features,'' Zywotow said. ``And we're expecting that with a
dedicated sales force that we can concentrate on our tradtional core
markets'' along the East Coast, Latin America and the Caribbean.

   The stock market posted some small gains Friday
amid what analysts described as yearend cross-currents of buying and
selling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.78 to 2,143.49,
closing out the week with a net gain of 51.21 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
769 up, 639 down and 581 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 133.77 million
shares, against 124.15 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 154.77 million shares.
   Analysts said some buying was prompted by expectations that
investing institutions might want to increase their stock holdings
before they make yearend reports to clients.
   At the same time, they said, the peak period has arrived for
yearend selling by investors looking to reduce their income taxes.
   Given these seasonal forces, brokers said, it was difficult to
discern any trends in the making for stock prices.
   Wall Streeters were also looking ahead to a full menu of econonic
news next week, including the monthly report on the nation's trade
balance, which is scheduled to be issued on Wednesday.
   Economists at Merrill Lynch project the figure for October to be
little changed from September, when imports exceeded exports by $9
billion excluding freight and insurance costs.
   Rite Aid sustained one of the day's largest percentage losses,
tumbling 3{ to 31\. The company estimated a 20 percent decline in
earnings for the fiscal quarter that ended Nov. 26.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business Machines

Telephone & Telegraph was down \ at 29{.
   Xtra jumped 2~ to 37~. An investor group disclosed that it held a

   Greenwich Pharmaceutical fell 1{ to 4{ in the over-the-counter
market. The company said the Food and Drug Administration asked for

   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.83 billion, or 0.14
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added

<HEAD>Finance Minister Biggest Casualty Yet of Insider Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IRENE M. KUNII</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigned Friday,
the highest-ranking government official to quit in the aftermath of
an insider trading scandal, while critics intensified demands for a
full-scale probe of the share purchases by politicians.
   Miyazawa said he was resigning as finance minister and deputy
premier to take responsibility for conflicting statements in
Parliament regarding his involvement in questionable purchases of
stock of the real estate firm Recruit-Cosmos Co.
   ``My explanations weren't sufficient and I am taking
responsibility,'' Miyazawa told reporters after he informed Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita he was quitting.
   He also said he hoped his resignation would facilitate passage of
a major tax reform package through the Parliament.
   ``Accomplishing tax reform is my mission,'' Miyazawa said. ``It
doesn't matter what happens to me.''
   Takeshita, who is expected to announce a Cabinet shuffle in the
next few weeks, told reporters later that he would assume the
finance portfolio. He refused to comment, however, on how long he
would hold that reponsibility.
   More than a dozen leading politicians, including Takeshita and
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, have been linked to the
stock profiteering deal devised by businessman Hiromasa Ezoe,
founder of the information conglomerate Recruit Co.
   Ezoe reportedly offered certain individuals the opportunity to
purchase bargain-priced shares in Recruit-Cosmos, a Recruit
affiliate, prior to their over-the-counter listing in October 1986.
Shortly after the shares were offered for public trading, their
value rose sharply and earned large profits for holders, many of
whom were also provided with interest-free financing to buy the
shares.
   Opposition leaders spearheading a probe of the stock deal _
dubbed Recruit-gate as a parallel to the U.S. Watergate scandal _
have charged that politicians were offered the lucrative shares in
return for political favor.
   Miyazawa himself came under fire after delivering several
conflicting reports regarding his former secretary's role in the
incident.
   He initially testified to a parliamentary committee investigating
the scandal that a third party, a friend of his former secretary,
purchased 10,000 Recruit-Cosmos shares and only borrowed the name of
``Miyazawa.''
   He later admitted his ex-secretary actually paid 30 million yen,
or about $246,000, for the shares in September 1986 and sold them
for 52.7 million yen or $431,000 less than a month later after they
were listed without the finance minister's knowledge.
   Miyazawa also insisted the stock purchase was not financed by a
Recruit-linked financial institution but refused to show bank
documents to back up his argument.
   Miyazawa is the largest casualty to date in the five-month-old
scandal that has shaken public confidence in Takeshita government.
   Public support for Takeshita's government dropped to 18 percent
from 30 percent when he assumed office a year ago, according to a
survey released Friday by the mass-circulation newspaper Mainichi
Shimbun.
   The leading opposition Japan Socialist Party and other critics
said Miyazawa's resignation was overdue but renewed demands for a
stepped-up investigation of the scandal.
   The Asahi Shimbun, a leading liberal daily, said it was time for
Takeshita to heed the opinion polls and ``listen to the voice of the
people'' who want the Recruit affair cleared up.

<HEAD>Judge Puts Commission Action Against Hunts On Hold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge has approved a
request to forestall action by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission against two of the Hunt brothers of Dallas while they
work out Chapter 11 reorganization settlements.
   ``We had an order (that) enjoined the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission from proceedings until other matters are resolved,'' said
Judge Harold Abramson of his 36-page opinion handed down Thursday in
the cases of William Herbert Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt.
   The CFTC complaint claims the two Dallas businessmen, who filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September, and others
manipulated the price of silver futures between fall 1979 and March
1980.
   Silver prices collapsed to $10 an ounce on March 27, 1980, after
previously hitting a high of $52 an ounce.
   Tom Whitaker, vice president of Hunt Energy and a spokesman for
the brothers, said the Hunts are pleased with Abramson's decision.
   ``Our ongoing intent is still intact _ that is to get all these
proceedings into one forum,'' he said.
   Whitaker estimated it could be 12 to 14 months before the
bankruptcy court matters are resolved. Attorneys for the Hunts filed
statements of financial affairs and schedules of assets and
liabilities in U.S. Bankruptcy Court last month.
   Now creditors have until mid-January to file claims with the
court, Whitaker said.
   Angela G. Tese, a New York bankruptcy attorney whose firm Cole &
Deitz has been observing the Hunt case, said Abramson's decision
means damages and claims against the brothers take precedence over
fines and penalties that might be imposed.
   ``The decision of the bankruptcy court judge is not an unusual
one at all,'' Ms. Tese said. ``It's in keeping with the spirit of
the bankruptcy code.''
   She said the decision apparently does not mean the CFTC will drop
its civil complaint against the Hunts. ``It's possible that they
will proceed at some later date,'' she said.
   The CFTC general counsel, who is handling the case, did not
immediately return telephone calls to The Associated Press on Friday.
   In September, administrative law Judge Arthur L. Shipe ruled that
the Hunts' personal bankruptcy court filings did not automatically
block the government's case against the brothers.
   The CFTC's complaint is the biggest market manipulation case ever
filed by the commission. If the Hunts lose, they could face fines of
$100,000 for each violation of federal commodity laws and be
premanently banned from trading in all futures markets.
   Whitaker also said Abramson's ruling also means the CFTC cannot
press its case until appeals are heard involving the Hunts' lawsuit
with the Peruvian company Minpeco.
   William Herbert Hunt, Nelson Bunker Hunt and their brother, Lamar
Hunt, and others were ordered by a federal court jury in New York to
pay Minpeco, the Peruvian governments' silver mining company, $134.6
million. The company had lost millions of dollars in the silver
price squeeze.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Lower in Choppy European Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against the major foreign
currencies Friday as investors turned their sights toward trade
deficit figures to be released next week.
   Gold prices were also mixed. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid of $422.50 for a troy ounce of gold, up from
$421.30 late Thursday, but the metal declined in overseas trading.
   Dollar trading was lackluster as investors squared their
positions in advance of the weekend and Wednesday's scheduled
release of balance of trade figures for October.
   Jack Barbanel, a market analyst for Gruntal & Co., predicted the
dollar would remain stable until the report is released.
   Overseas, dealers said the dollar was pressured lower by strength
in the West German mark. They said the mark rose amid speculation
that the Bundesbank would raise its Lombard rate by a half
percentage point to 5.5 percent.
   The Lombard rate is the interest the central bank charges
commercial banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are
used as collateral.
   In Frankfurt, the dollar slipped to 1.7330 marks from 1.7420 late
Thursday. In New York, it fell to 1.73525 marks from 1.73865.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.59 yen to a closing 122.43 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 122.30 yen, and in New York, the dollar rose
to 122.49 yen from 122.30 late Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.8490 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.8510 Thursday. In New
York, the pound was worth $1.8495, compared with late Thursday's
$1.85505.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's prices, included: 1.4620 Swiss francs, down from 1.4633;
5.9290 French francs, down from 5.9350; 1,282.75 Italian lire, down
from 1,283.00; and 1.19665 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19275.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.4605 Swiss francs, down from 1.4665; 5.9240
French francs, down from 5.9450; 1.9560 Dutch guilders, down from
1.9645; 1,280.25 Italian lire, down from 1,285.00; 1.1970 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1933.
   Gold closed at $422.90 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, up from 421.30 late Thursday.
   But gold fell earlier in London to a late bid price of $420.75 a
troy ounce, compared with $423.50 late Thursday, and in Zurich, it
closed at a bid $420.30, compared with $423 bid late Thursday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell $1.24 to close at a bid $423.64.
   Silver bullion prices held steady on the London market where the
metal was trading at a late bid price of $6.16 a troy ounce,
unchanged from Thursday.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver rose to $6.175 a
troy ounce from late Thursday's $6.128.

<HEAD>A Muted Yearend Rally On Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The storied yearend rally has arrived on schedule
for Wall Street, but not quite with its usual measure of
holiday-season cheer.
   Even as stock prices were rising in the past week, some of the
largest securities firms were issuing cautious appraisals of the
investment outlook for 1989.
   And what many analysts were calling the ``Gorbachev rally''
showed signs of faltering even before the Soviet leader's historic
U.S. visit was abruptly overshadowed by the disastrous earthquake in
Soviet Armenia.
   At first, it seemed that Mikhail Gorbachev's pledge to reduce the
Soviet Union's military forces and spending had the makings of a
major stimulus for the American stock and bond markets.
   ``The U.S. in turn could decrease defensive spending, relieve
pressure on an overheated economy, and thereby reduce the federal
budget deficit,'' said Edward Nicoski, an analyst at Piper, Jaffray
& Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis.
   Government bond prices, which move in the opposite direction from
interest rates, staged their strongest single-day rally in three
months.
   But the stock market, after responding enthusiastically to
advance reports of the message Gorbachev was bringing, leveled off
by the time he actually delivered it.
   Many market participants quickly shifted their attention back to
the prospect of further credit-tightening by the Federal Reserve to
keep economic growth restrained.
   ``The caveat as to the sustainability of this rally rests on the
trend and level of interest rates,'' Nicoski observed.
   ``While the Gorbachev proposal is a giant step in the right
direction, we question whether the Federal Reserve or other central
banks dare relax their monetary reins.''
   Analysts at Merrill Lynch, in issuing their 1989 forecast,
predicted a further rise in interest rates before they turn downward
next year.
   Donald Straszheim, the firm's chief economist, said he expected
the yield on long-term Treasury bonds, recently hovering around 9
percent, to average 9.3 percent in the first quarter of the new year.
   ``Later in 1989,'' he added, ``a weakening economy and a leveling
of inflation should cause a substantial decline'' in rates.
   At the close on Friday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
stood at 2,143.49, up 51.21 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.57 to 155.59;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
1.29 to 375.20, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 2.34 at 297.61.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 141.86 million shares a day,
against 132.54 million in the previous week.
   In their yearend forecasts, both Merrill Lynch and Salomon
Brothers Inc. predicted a ``trading range'' stock market in 1989
similar to the pattern that has prevailed this year.
   ``Restructuring activity should extend into 1989, limiting
downside risk in the market, but also continuing to alienate
traditional investors,'' Salomon analysts said.
   Robert Farrell, Merrill Lynch's chief market analyst, said stocks
are likely to remain in ``transition'' until the economy weakens
enough to allow interest rates to fall.
   ``Apparent complacency about credit risk _ reflected in the
relatively narrow yield spread between Treasury bond and junk bond
yields _ is not usually characteristic of the beginning of a bull
market,'' Farrell said.
   ``New bull markets usually evolve out of recessions when quality
spreads are widening sharply and the Federal Reserve is forced to
ease.''

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Hit New 4-Month High On Brazil Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices soared to four-month highs Friday on New
York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange on expectations of reduced
availabilty of sugar from Brazil, analysts said.
   On other markets, coffee, cattle, pork, energy and
precious-metals futures all gained; grains and soybeans were mixed;
and stock-index futures retreated.
   Sugar for delivery in March settled .55 cent higher at 11.86
cents a pound, the highest daily settlement since Aug. 5, on rumors
that the Brazilian Alcohol and Sugar Institute was preparing to
announce a diversion of substantially more sugar cane from
sugar-making to alcohol production.
   Brazil has embraced the use of gasohol _ an automobile fuel made
from gasoline and alcohol _ like no other country. A recent OPEC
agreement to limit crude-oil production has pushed oil and gasoline
prices higher, which in turn has led to speculation that Brazil will
renew its efforts to encourage gasohol use, analysts said.
   If the government-run Alcohol and Sugar Institute does indeed
announce a greater diversion of sugar cane to alcohol production
scheduled for release on Monday, ``obviously that would mean less
sugar would be available for exporting purposes,'' said Arthur
Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York.
   Sugar prices had fallen earlier in the week on speculation that
Brazil would soon emerge as a large-volume seller of sugar on the
world market.
   ``This has really turned that situation upside down,'' Stevenson
said.
   Brazilian concerns also fueled a strong rally in the coffee
market. It's been a dry spring so far in Brazil, the world's largest
coffee producer, and fears of drought damage to the 1988-89
Brazilian coffee crop have begun to surface.
   Meanwhile, the weather in Columbia, the No. 2 coffee producer,
has been extremely wet, hampering the harvest of the 1987-88 coffee
crop, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York.
   Coffee settled .29 cent to 1.60 cent higher with March at $1.2727
a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures posted strong gains on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange on bullish signals from the cash markets,
including the first signs of a significant drop in hog slaughters
since early 1987.
   Hog kills for the day totaled 337,000 compared to 339,000 a year
ago, and kills for the week totaled 1.881 million vs. 1.879 million
a year ago.
   The current figures were closer to year-ago figures than the
market has seen in more than a year, and the weekly total was about
3 percent below the previous week, said Tom O'Hare, an analyst in
New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   Pork futures traders have been expecting a slowdown in slaughters
for some time, he said, adding: ``anyone with bullish aspirations
had to be licking their lips today.''
   Live cattle settled .95 cent to 1.10 cents higher with December
at 71.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent to 1.08 cents
higher with January at 83 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to
1.13 cents higher with December at 41.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .85 cent to 1.23 cents higher with February at 43.25
cents a pound.
   Oil futures finished on a strong note at the New York Mercantile
Exchange on feelings the market is bound to rise if members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries stick by their new
crude-oil production quotas.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 33 cents to 40 cents
higher with January at $15.84 a barrel; heating oil was 1.42 cents
to 1.80 cents higher with January at 49.50 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .53 cent to 1.19 cents higher with January at 44.46
cents a gallon.
   Precious-metals futures followed the oil market higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 90 cents to $1.10 higher with February at $427.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.2 cents to 4.7 cents higher with March at
$6.305 a troy ounce.
   Wheat and soybean futures prices finished mostly lower while most
corn and oat futures advanced slightly in subdued trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with December at $4.27 a
bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 2} cents higher with December at
$2.59{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3} cents higher with December
at $2.05} a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher
with January at $7.73{ a bushel.
   Stock-index futures finished slightly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the
Standard & Poor's 500 index settled .25 point lower at 280.45. Each
point is worth $500.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. boosted some incentives and extended others after
other automakers made similar moves earlier this week, while General
Motors Corp. extended an offer of free gasoline for some car buyers,
the companies said Friday.
   New Ford incentives ranged from $300 to $3,000 and expire in
January or February, depending on the model of car and where it is
purchased.
   ``The increases are in response to the additional incentives
announced by our competitors earlier this week,'' said Robert Rewey,
vice president for Ford's North American Sales Operations.
   Meantime, GM's Oldsmobile Division said it was extending its
offer for a year's free gasoline from Nov. 31 to Dec. 31 for some
Cutlass Supreme buyers.

<HEAD>Minnesota Dropped For Clean Coal Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said Friday it has ended
negotiations with the state of Minnesota aimed at financing one of
the department's ``clean coal'' demonstration projects.
   Instead, the department will begin negotiations with sponsors of
other potential projects in West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Montana.
   Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources had proposed to join
U.S. Steel Corp. in an advanced ironmaking project near Mountain
Iron, Minn., using raw coal in a low-pollution system.
   Most iron production requires the conversion of coal into coke.
   The department said the state had been unable after a year of
trying to win financial backing for its share in the project. The
``clean coal'' program requires local sponsors to put up at least
half the cost of a project.
   The decision to end negotiations does not mean there were any
technical flaws or that the state had been unresponsive, just that
``financial support was not available to allow the project to
proceed in a timely manner.''
   The decision will free about $25 million to $30 million in
federal funds and the department said it would open negotiations
with Combustion Engineering Inc. to extend an existing coal-cleaning
project sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute at Homer
City, Pa.; with United Coal Co. of Bristol, Va., to demonstrate the
recovery of low-sulfur coal particles from a mine waste disposal
pond at Logan County, W. Va.; and with Western Energy Co. to upgrade
western coals by reducing moisture and sulfur content at Colstrip,
Mont.
   The clean coal program is aimed at financing $5 billion worth of
projects over five years, at least half the money to come from
non-federal sources.

<HEAD>Macmillan Agrees to Sell Michie to Mead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Macmillan Inc. said Friday it agreed to sell
Michie Co., which publishes materials for the legal profession, to
the Mead Corp., a paper, forest products and electronic publishing
concern, for about $226.5 million.
   Macmillan said in signing a letter of intent that the companies
hoped to complete the deal before the end of the year.
   It would be the second major asset sale involving Macmillan since
the giant publishing concern was acquired for $2.5 billion in early
November by Maxwell Communication Corp., the British communications
company run by Robert Maxwell.
   Macmillan and Maxwell announced last week the sale of four
subsidiaries for about $400 million to the leveraged buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
   Michie, which is based in Charlottesville, Va., publishes
annotated state statutes, state agency publications and other
reference publications used by the legal profession.
   Mead, which is based in Dayton, Ohio, already has an electronic
publishing unit, Mead Data Central, that accounted for about $231
million of the parent company's $4.2 billion in revenue in 1987.
   Among Mead Central's services are the Lexis database that
compiles legal news and the Nexis service that offers general and
financial news to 200,000 users in the United States and overseas.
   ``This important acquisition is a further reflection of Mead Data
Central's long term commitment to expand the services and products
it offers the legal community,'' said Burnell R. Roberts, Mead's
chairman and chief executive.
   Last week, Macmillan and Maxwell announced they had agreed to
sell Macmillan Books Clubs Inc., an operator of several specialty
book clubs specializing in the sciences; Gryphon Editions, which
publishes reprints in medicine and law; Intertec Publishing Corp.,
which publishes 14 specialty magazines; and Webb Publishing, which
publishes agricultural magazines.
   The buyer in that case was Kohlberg Kravis, the buyout firm that
had sided with senior Macmillan managers in competing against
Maxwell for Macmillan.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Golden Nugget Inc. Chairman Steve Wynn said
Friday he liked the name ``The Mirage'' so much, he paid $500,000 to
use it for his new $585 million resort on the Las Vegas Strip.
   Wynn's announcement ended speculation that the new resort on the
Las Vegas Strip would carry the same name as his hotel-casino in the
downtown's Glitter Gulch.
   Wynn said he and others at the resort knew they had to have a new
name for the new property, or the downtown Golden Nugget would
become know as ``the old one'' and the Strip resort ``the new one.''
   ``It didn't seem fair that this property would be called `the old
one,''' Wynn said.
   The downtown casino dates to 1946, but renovations, a new tower
and luxury suites have pushed the value to $200 million, Wynn said.
   The gaming chief said he settled on the name ``The Mirage''
because of the South Pacific theme, then had to wrestle with the
problem of two other Las Vegas motels that carry the same name.
   Wynn said he went to the owners of the Mirage Motel and La
Mirage, and paid them $250,000 each to change their name as of July
1.
   Wynn said the new property will open early next December. He said
he planned to be a major player in bringing boxing matches to Las
Vegas, joining Hilton and neighboring Caesars Palace as a major
promoter of the events.
   ``We're going to be the third player in the game,'' Wynn said.
   Wynn said he had no intention of selling his downtown property.
   ``It has broken every profit record this year,'' Wynn said.
``It's one of the most successful entities in America.''
   ``Anything's for sale,'' he added, qualifying his statement. ``I
didn't think I'd ever sell Atlantic City, then they came along and
offered me $440 million.''
   Wynn sold his Golden Nugget hotel and casino in Atlantic City to
Bally Corp. in 1987.
   Earlier this summer the Golden Nugget purchased the Nevada Club
in Laughlin, Nev. Wynn plans to build an 1,100-room hotel there.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Mixed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bond prices ended mixed in slow trading Friday,
reflecting what credit-market strategists called uncertainty over
the direction of interest rates.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond rose about [ point or $1.25 per
$1,000 in face amount, and its yield eased to 8.95 percent from 8.96
percent Thursday.
   One noteworthy development was a rise in rates on short-term
Treasury notes to yield more than that of 30-year bonds, an unusual
shift that last occurred prior to the 1981-82 recession. But the
significance of the so-called inverted yield curve remains unclear.
   Bond strategists said the market was influenced largely by
confusion over whether or when the Federal Reserve will move to
tighten credit conditions in order to pre-empt inflationary pressure
and keep the dollar stable.
   They said the confusion may be clarified somewhat next Wednesday,
when the Commerce Department is scheduled to release the
market-sensitive monthly trade deficit figures for October. A large
imbalance could hurt the dollar's value and force the Fed to raise
interest rates.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell [ point, intermediate maturities fell \ point and
long-term issues rose [ point, the Telerate Inc., financial
information service reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures
price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities
of a year or longer, fell 1.45 to 1,135.57.
   In corporate trading, industrials and utilities also fell.
Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, lost 1.00 to 295.10.
   Prices strengthened slightly in the tax-exempt market. The Bond
Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was up 7-32 point
at 90 as of 3 p.m. EST. The average yield to maturity was 7.90
percent, down from 7.92 percent Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.14 percent as the
discount fell 8 basis points to 7.88 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.67 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to
8.21 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.92 percent as the
discount rose 5 basis points to 8.28 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8{ percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Saudi-Texaco Deal Could Erode Domestic Oil
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans by the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. to buy half
of Texaco Inc.'s refining and marketing assets could further erode
the domestic oil industry and increase reliance on foreign supplies,
Rep. John Bryant said Friday in asking the treasury secretary to
investigate the proposed deal.
   ``The enormity of this acquisition causes us to believe a second
look should be taken at the matter, because of its possible impact
on the domestic oil and gas industry and on our ability to become
energy independent,'' Bryant said.
   Bryant, a Dallas Democrat, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, Sen.
Jeff Bingamon, D-N.M., and Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., appealed to
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to investigate the joint
venture, named Star Enterprises, on national security grounds.
   The Saudi-Texaco deal, announced Nov. 10, would include three
refineries, 50 distribution terminals, 1,400 service stations and
10,000 franchised gasoline stations in 23 Eastern and Gulf Coast
states.
   In their letter, the Democrats said they believe the acquisition
falls under the law enabling the government to block mergers
involving a foreign interests if there is evidence that national
security is threatened.
   The acquisition, they wrote, could ``seriously increase U.S.
dependence on foreign oil, threaten the viability of the domestic
oil industry and jeopardize the well-being of American consumers.''
   ``The lessons of the 1973-74 oil embargo and the 1978-79 shortage
taught our country all too well the economic and political
consequences of reliance on vulnerable oil supplies,'' the letter
said.
   ``What is particulary noteworthy is that 96 percent of the
capacity of the three refineries will be used in refining Saudi
Arabian crude oil,'' Bryant said. ``So you've got a circumstance
that Saudi Arabia has guaranteed itself an outlet for crude oil into
the American market, giving them the option of lowering crude prices
while earning increased prices at the gasoline marketing level. This
could amount to an enormous loss to domestic producers and leave us
even more dependent on foreigh oil.''
   Also, he said, foreign countries are immune from our antitrust
laws, ``so it's not clear we could enforce antitrust laws against
this merged entity if needed to do so to protect consumers from
market manipulation.''
   He said Saudi Arabia has announced a concerted effort to expand
its dominance in U.S. oil markets and that its goal is to become the
10th largest seller of gasoline in the United States as a first step.

   The Financial Accounting Standards Board

``Accounting for Income Taxes,'' until fiscal years starting after
Dec. 15, 1989.
   FASB project manager Robert Wilkens said the board voted to delay
the effective date of Statement 96 to allow more time for companies
and their auditors to understand how to apply the statement.
   The board also voted that a new accounting statement, which will
be issued later this month, will apply only to companies that have
not yet adopted Statement 96. Companies that have already adopted
Statement 96 are not permitted to revert to previously applied
accounting principles, the board ruled.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Enjoins MAI Bid for Prime Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled Friday that MAI Basic Four
Inc. understated the role of its investment banker during its $970
million offer for Prime Computer Inc. and said he would issue an
order halting the hostile bid.
   But U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone said he would stay the
order pending an appeal by MAI Basic to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Boston.
   Mazzone said that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had played a much
larger role in the deal than MAI Basic, which is controlled by New
York investor Bennett S. LeBow, had disclosed in filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   He said Drexel's extensive role in advising and financing the
$20-a-share bid turned it from an investment banker into a bidder.
Prime had alleged that Drexel controlled the bid through a series of
investment partnerships that were not disclosed in federal filings.
   The judge also said MAI Basic should have been more forthright
about past legal problems involving LeBow and William Weksel, who
together own 43 percent of MAI's shares and have been named as
defendants in past shareholder lawsuits.
   MAI Basic, a computer company based in Tustin, Calif., said in a
statement: ``While we have not yet seen the written order, we do not
believe that it will in any way impede the consummation of our
offer.''
   Prime closed at $16.75, down 37.5 cents, in composite New York
Stock Exchange Trading Friday.
   The bid for Natick-based Prime was made Nov. 15 and is scheduled
to expire Dec. 21.
   Prime, which is about four times the size of its potential buyer,
late last month rejected the MAI Basic offer. MAI Basic owns 4.1
percent of Prime's 48.5 million shares outstanding.
   Prime sued MAI Basic in federal court about one week after the
takeover bid surfaced.
   In a separate legal matter, the two companies squared off in
Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, Del., on Friday over a
request by MAI Basic for a preliminary injunction against Prime's
antitakoever defenses.
   Vice Chancellor Maurie A. Hartnett heard two hours of oral
arguments but withheld a decision on the injunction. MAI Basic
maintains that Prime enacted a ``poison pill'' anti-takeover plan in
October to forestall a potential takeover.
   Prime is second to International Business Machines Corp. in the
field of computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. It also
makes sophisticated computer workstations for engineers and database
management systems.
   Prime reported earnings of $33.4 million, or 69 cents a share, on
revenue of $1.16 billion for the first three quarters of 1988. MAI
Basic reported earnings of $18.7 million, or $1.25 a share, on
revenue of $302.9 million.

   David P. Bloom, the would-be financial adviser
who bilked investors out of $15 million to fund a lavish lifestyle
of expensive artworks, luxury cars and posh homes, was sentenced
Friday to eight years in prison by a judge who called him ``amoral,
not immoral.''
   Asking the judge to give Bloom, 24, a shorter sentence than the
three-year term handed master Wall Street criminal Ivan F. Boesky,
Bloom's lawyer described him as a ``greedy young man and a product
of our times.''
   ``When he grew up, greed was on the ascendency,'' said the
lawyer, David W. O'Connor. ``David Bloom shouldn't wind up being the
scapegoat of the 1980s.''
   But U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein said he was imposing
the stiff sentence because it was ``absolutely essential'' to send a
message to those who act through ``greed and insatiable lust for
despoiling innocent people.''
   The high-living Bloom, whose massive swindle scheme earned him
the title ``Wall Street Whiz Kid,'' pleaded guilty last March to one
count each of mail fraud and securities fraud. Most of the investors
he conned were friends of his parents, according to prosecutors.
   In a 15-page sentencing memo to the judge, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Robert L. Plotz said Bloom ``victimized close friends of
his parents'' and ``betrayed the trust not only of these friends but
also of his parents.''
   Noting that several of Bloom's victims had turned over pension
plans and individual retirement accounts to him, the memo said Bloom
``took everything he could from people who loved him; in so doing,
he exhibited a legal and moral depravity.''
   ``I have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and
betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me,'' the
short, bespectacled Bloom, standing with his hands crossed in front
of him, told the judge.
   He conceded he was ``deserving of punishment'' but O'Connor urged
the judge to show leniency because ``this is not Ivan Boesky or
(convicted inside trader) Dennis Levine.''
   Boesky, who pleaded guilty to securities law conspiracy and is
cooperating with investigators, was sentenced to three years in
prison last December. Levine, an investment banker caught in a
massive insider trading scheme, was sentenced to two years in 1986.
   O'Connor called Bloom's crime ``a bizarre aberration,'' and told
the judge that a stiff sentence was ``not going to discourage the
next screwball who comes along.''
   But Edelstein concluded Bloom was ``remorseless, completely
lacking in conscience. He was a predator, completely insensitive.''
   Edelstein sentenced Bloom to four years on each count and, in an
unusual move, ordered the prison terms to run consecutively as
spectators in the crowded courtroom gasped.
   ``He went on his way without any thought of the pain, suffering
and misery he was inflicting,'' said a disgusted Edelstein. ``He was
amoral, not immoral.''
   The judge said Bloom had ``cannibalized his family and friends.''
He also ordered Bloom to make ``full restitution.''
   No fine was imposed.
   Edelstein could have sentenced Bloom to 10 years in prison and
$20 million in fines.
   According to prosecutors, the boyish-looking Bloom used deceit
and fraud to parlay a college investment club into a
multimillion-dollar investment operation with about 140 clients.
   Bloom, who was not registered as an investment adviser, wooed
investors for his now-defunct Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc. by
falsely claiming his clientele included the Sultan of Brunei, the
Rockefeller family and entertainer Bill Cosby.
   A 1985 Duke University graduate with an art history degree, Bloom
told clients he was putting their money into the stock market when
he actually was using it to pay for a lavish lifestyle that included
art works worth $5.5 million; an $830,000 condominium on Manhattan's
Upper East Side; a Long Island beach house worth $1.9 million; and
two cars _ an Aston-Martin convertible and a Mercedes-Benz _ worth
$200,000.
   Among the paintings Bloom purchased with other people's money
were works by John Sloan, Thomas Hart Benton, Mary Cassatt and John
Singer Sargent.
   Bloom began sending his investors bogus account statements that
claimed to show their securities holdings, according to the charges.
   Bloom also was charged with using new clients' funds to pay
``profits'' to older clients.
   Last January, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought
civil charges against Bloom, who settled by agreeing to turn over
his assets to a court-appointed receiver and to stay out of the
securities industry for the rest of his life.
   Under the settlement, Bloom neither admitted nor denied the SEC
allegations but criminal charges were brought in March. Bloom waived
indictment and pleaded guilty March 31 to one count each of mail and
securities fraud.

   Two major computer software companies, Duquesne
Systems Inc. of Pittsburgh and Morino Inc. of Vienna, Va., said
Friday they will merge into one of the industry's largest
independent companies.
   ``Our merger represents the first true merger in our industry,
one which brings together two companies with comparable histories,
successes and operating philosophies,'' they said in a joint
statement.
   Both serve the growing market for programs for larger IBM and
compatible mainframe computers.
   Mario M. Morino, chairman of the Virginia company, will become
chairman of the new concern, and Duquesne Chairman Glen F. Chatfield
will become chief executive.
   The combined firm, for which a name was not announced, will be
valued at about $400 million, with 600 employees generating annual
sales of about $100 million. The new company will have cash of
nearly $60 million and no debt.
   ``We'll be attractively positioned for both internal development
and external expansion,'' the two chairmen said.
   Duquesne and Morino will maintain their present headquarters.
They proposed merging no later than March 31 in a stock swap,
pending approval of their boards and shareholders.
   Duquesne Systems was founded in 1970 and over the last five years
has grown at a rate of 60 percent compounded annually, with 1988
revenue of $50.3 million.
   Morino began developing software for other vendors in 1973 and by
June 30, 1988, had reached $44.7 million in revenue.

   After a volatile week, oil futures prices
finished on a strong note.
   ``The market closed at one of its highest levels in a long
time,'' said Richard Redoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, settled
40 cents higher Friday at $15.84 cents a barrel, after falling 30
cents on Thursday during a technical selloff. The contract had been
up and down throughout the week.
   Other contract months also gained ground Friday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the
January contract for wholesale home heating oil closed 1.42 cents
higher at 49.50 cents a gallon. The contract had fallen 0.81 cent on
Thursday.
   Traders said seasonal demand was responsible for the sharp price
increase.
   January unleaded gasoline, which gained 0.17 cent in the previous
session, settled at 44.46 cents a gallon, up 0.53 cent.
   Redoglia said there was ``no real news, no real fundamental
reason'' for Friday's rally.
   ``Except there's a feeling the market can work higher if OPEC
sticks to its quotas,'' he said.
   In late November, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries reached a production agreement aimed at propping up
sagging worldwide oil prices.
