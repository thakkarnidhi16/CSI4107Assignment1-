   The St. Petersburg Times had a winning
ticket but no winners in the fledgling Florida lottery's first
computerized numbers game.
   A photo at the top of the front page of Friday morning's
newspaper showed the numbers 8-0-6, which turned out to be the
winning combination in the first Cash 3 contest that night. The
photo, used to illustrate a story about the lottery, was of a
sample ticket sent to the paper a month ago.
   ``This was entirely coincidental,'' City Editor Jack Reed said.
``It doesn't seem like that should need to be said, but we've
gotten so many calls.''
   The first daily contest produced 859 winners but none in the
Times newsroom.
   ``In fact, I don't know anyone that played daily game in the
newsroom,'' Reed said.
   A spokesman for the lottery said the first Cash 3 game drawing
went off without a hitch. Pingpong balls with the winning numbers
were selected in only 60 seconds. The payout totaled $94,090.
   Ticket sales are expected to top $10 million in the first week.
By 7:30 p.m. Friday, $616,543 had been wagered on Cash 3 and
$345,377 on the jackpot Lotto game. Thirty-five percent of all
lottery revenues are earmarked for public education.
   The first Lotto drawing will be held May 7. The prize will be at
least $2 million but could reach $4 million.
   Florida joins 27 other states and the District of Columbia that
have legalized lotteries. Law enforcement officials hope the
legalized Florida numbers games will help undermine illegal numbers
rackets.

   Juveniles cause more than 60 percent of the crime
in China the crimes they commit are becoming more violent, the
official China Daily reported today.
   The newspaper quoted Xu Jian, vice president of China Research
Association of Juvenile Delinquency, as saying the rate of juvenile
crime is 12 per 10,000 of the same age group.
   He said that was more than double the overall crime rate of 5
per 10,000 people, but still much lower than in developed countries.
   Xu gave no figures for juvenile crimes or what age group is
classified as juveniles.
   He said youths who in the past mainly committed minor offenses
such as petty thefts and fighting are now engaged in robberies,
violent assaults and rapes. Xu attributed the rise in juvenile
crime to the lack of proper laws, the spread of pornography, the
increasing numbers of working parents and divorce.
   Girls, mainly involved in hooliganism _ a general term for
unsocial behavior _ or sex crimes, made up 18.6 percent of juvenile
criminals in 1985, up from 10 percent in 1983, he said.
   Xu said juvenile delinquency would continue to rise in the near
future and called for a national network to educate and prevent
youths from committing crimes.

<BYLINE>Proposed Oil Deal Hinges On Saudi Assent</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC moved one major step closer today to
an agreement that could slightly increase oil prices and set the
stage for closer coordination with oil producers outside its ranks.
   But clinching the deal required the approval of oil ministers
from Saudi Arabia and its three Persian Gulf Arab allies, who said
they needed to consult their governments first.
   A meeting of all OPEC oil ministers was set for tonight at
cartel headquarters, but it was not certain a final decision would
be made then.
   Eight of the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed in a meeting that ended early today to a
proposed 2 percent cut in OPEC's total oil production, according to
oil ministers from Iran and Venezuela.
   The cuts would be for May and June only, said Venezuelan Oil
Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti.
   The Saudis earlier indicated they opposed production cuts,
believing prices would rebound soon anyway since oil demand is
likely to rise this summer.
   Saudi King Fahd said in a newspaper interview Thursday that OPEC
should simply stick to its current set of production quotas, which
often are exceeded. He did not explicitly rule out cuts as small as
those proposed in Vienna.
   Besides Saudi Arabia, the others saying they wanted to think it
over were Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
   Iraq, which is not party to OPEC's existing agreement on
production limits, was not expected to take part in the proposed
cuts, Hernandez said.
   The eight that tentatively accepted the deal this morning were
Iran, Algeria, Libya, Nigeria, Gabon, Venezuela, Ecuador and
Indonesia. The proposal was put on the table by Algeria.
   The proposed cuts in output, in conjunction with similarly small
cuts by a group of six independent oil-producing nations, would
remove a total of 500,000 barrels a day from the world oil market.
   The goal is to lift oil prices to OPEC's target of $18 a
42-gallon barrel from the range now of between $14 and $16.
   Oil prices on the open market moved erratically in nervous
trading Friday. Prices fell more than 60 cents a barrel in Europe
but recovered in later U.S. trading.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June contracts for West
Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. grade of oil, closed at $17.99 a
barrel, up one cent from Thursday. At one point, the price was off
43 cents but then recovered.
   The proposed OPEC cuts are so small that analysts said the main
effect on the market would be psychological. For OPEC, the
principal benefit would be establishing closer ties to rival oil
producers, who in recent years have weakened OPEC by taking away
its market share.
   OPEC and non-OPEC producers have never before formally agreed to
mutual cuts in production, although Mexico has informally sought to
align its policies with OPEC.
   The non-OPEC countries involved in the current proposal are
Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman, Malaysia and Angola.
   Representatives of these independent producers were in Vienna
earlier this week for talks with a committee of six OPEC oil
ministers. They left before OPEC's meeting began Thursday, so it
was not immediately clear if they would be satisfied with the
proposed cut of 2 percent, or 300,000 barrels a day, in OPEC
production.
   The non-OPEC group stipulated it would cut its oil exports by 5
percent, or 200,000 barrels a day, only if OPEC made ``similar,
proportional'' reductions. It was not more precise about the
reciprocity.
   Regardless of the outcome of the talks on production cuts, OPEC
intended to step up contacts with the non-OPEC group in hopes of
establishing a regular dialogue that could lead to more
coordination of production and pricing policy in the future,
several oil ministers said.
   ``We must send a positive signal to them,'' said Gholamreza
Aghazadeh, the oil minister of Iran.

<HEAD>Panamanian Opposition Angered by Reported Deal on Noriega</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian opposition leaders are reacting
angrily to a proposed deal under which military strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega would resign his post but remain in Panama at least
temporarily instead of going into exile.
   U.S. officials confirmed Friday that Noriega agreed during
negotiations with the Reagan administration to step down as
commander of the Defense Forces but that he had rejected U.S.
efforts to persuade him to leave the country immediately after
resigning.
   The Washington Post said Noriega is expected to step down in a
matter of weeks and would prefer to live in the Dominican Republic
if he is forced into exile.
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of the anti-Noriega
forces in Washington, reacted sharply to word of the proposed
agreement. He accused the United States of going beyond its
authority in trying to negotiate Panama's political future.
   That issue, he said in an interview, ``has to be negotiated by
Panamanians.''
   He said Noriega, by remaining in Panama, would be able to
``wield his considerable influence'' because of the many
Panamanians in the Defense Forces and in other key positions who
are loyal to him.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, acknowledged that the
arrangement was ``less than ideal'' because it does not contemplate
Noriega's short-term departure from Panama.
   Sosa has remained on as Panama's ambassador to the United
States, refusing to relinquish the embassy to a replacement envoy
named by Panamanian President Manuel Solis Palma.
   Sosa and the United States share the view that President Eric
Arturo Delvalle, deposed on Feb. 26 by Noriega's supporters,
continues to be the legitimate authority in Panama.
   In Miami, Roberto Eisenmann, exiled publisher of the closed
independent newspaper La Prensa, said: ``This sounds like a
surrender with cosmetics. This is the same mistake all over again _
the United States intervening in Panama, ignoring totally the
political forces of the country.''
   Gilberto Mallol, Miami representative of the Panamanian
opposition umbrella group, the Civic Crusade, agreed.
   ``This cosmetic solution will only take the country down the
road to disaster,'' said Mallol. ``The Reagan administration has no
right to decide Noriega can remain in Panama.''
   Mallol disputed U.S. contentions that Noriega will be out of
power as soon as he is out of uniform. ``Obviously, this deal shows
Noriega is making conditions. He will continue to interfere and
continue the militarization of Panama.''
   Mallol warned that the deal could backfire on the United States,
causing a wave of anti-American sentiment among Noriega opponents.
   The administration has been seeking Noriega's ouster since he
was indicted in early February on drug smuggling charges by two
Florida grand juries.
   Spain has offered to give Noriega political asylum and, as an
inducement to him, the administration has said it would make no
effort to extradite him if he accepted the Spanish bid.
   The administration has refused to recognize Panama's 2-month-old
government and has frozen Panamanian government assets in the
United States, among other measures. These steps have contributed
to the collapse of the Panamanian economy.

<HEAD>New Persian Gulf Policy Will Put Pressure On Iran, Official Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is expanding the
U.S. military role in the Persian Gulf, saying it will not ``stand
by and watch innocent people be killed or maimed'' in attacks on
neutral ships.
   Under a policy announced Friday by Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci, U.S. forces will go to the aid of non-communist, neutral
ships that are fired on and ask for help.
   Previously, the umbrella of U.S. protection had covered only
American-flagged vessels and 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers that were
allowed to register last summer as U.S.-flag vessels.
   The new policy, approved by President Reagan at a White House
meeting Friday, is aimed chiefly at Iran, which U.S. officials
blame for nearly all of the attacks on ships outside declared
war-exclusion zones. However, Carlucci said the policy should not
be viewed as ``a tilt in either direction'' in the nearly
eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.
   Reagan's order came 11 days after American warships and aircraft
clashed with Iranian forces in the gulf, sinking or disabling six
Iranian vessels. The battles erupted following a Navy attack on
Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for the mining of a U.S.
frigate.
   Describing the new policy, Carlucci said: ``We are not the
policeman of the gulf, nor do we wish to be.
   ``For over 200 years, U.S. policy has been to help protect
freedom of navigation in international waters. This (new)
assistance is a logical and humanitarian outgrowth of recent events
in the gulf which further strengthens our adherence to this
principle.
   ``We cannot stand by and watch innocent people be killed or
maimed by malicious, lawless actions when we have the means to
assist, and perhaps prevent them. We do not intend to describe our
specific rules of engagement or the methods we plan to use in
rendering this assistance.''
   Carlucci said the new policy will be provided to ``friendly,
innocent neutral vessels flying a non-belligerent flag, outside
declared war-exclusion zones, that are not carrying contraband or
resisting legitimate visit and search by a Persian Gulf
belligerent.''
   An administration official said the policy will put ``a little
more pressure'' on Iran to accept a cease-fire and withdrawal to
pre-war borders.
   Most of Iran's attacks on ships have been in open, territorial
waters that will be covered by the new policy, said the official,
declining to be identified. By contrast, Iraq's attacks have been
confined largely to so-called exclusionary zones that are not
covered.
   The official noted that the protective coverage does not apply
to ships from communist countries, and emphasized that skippers
must request aid before an American ship renders assistance.
   Currently, the Navy has 17 ships in the gulf, including six
mine-sweepers, and 10 others in nearby waters. The current
protective effort costs $1 million a day.
   Carlucci said that he does not anticipate the new policy will
require an increase in U.S. forces.
   The Marine Corps, meanwhile, declared that two officers who were
listed as missing after the fighting 11 days earlier were ``killed
in action'' and disclosed that they had reported a hostile radar
had locked on their helicopter gunship before it disappeared.
   In a statement, the corps refused to say the AH-1T Cobra gunship
flown by Capt. Stephen C. Leslie, 30, of New Bern, N.C., and Capt.
Kenneth W. Hill, 33, of Thomasville, N.C., had definitely been shot
down by Iranian forces, as Iran has claimed.

   The House says the Reagan administration ought
to talk with NATO countries and Japan about spending more for
defense, but has rejected calls to bring American troops home if
that isn't done.
   The decisions were part of the Democratic-controlled House's
effort to write a Pentagon budget bill for the fiscal year starting
Oct. 1.
   The House voted 359-0 late Friday afternoon to approve a
proposal calling for the administration to initiate talks with
Japan and NATO member nations about sharing the burden for defense.
   The House vote came as the Pentagon released its 1988 report on
``Allied Contributions to the Common Defense,'' an annual
assessment mandated by Congress.
   The report was accompanied by a personal pledge from Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci to ``press at every opportunity for
progress'' in sharing the burdens of the alliance.
   Carlucci said the report's ``principal conclusion'' is that the
allies are making more of a contribution than they receive credit
for, but he said ``there are substantial variations in performance
among individual allies.''
   The House vote echoed a similar proposal approved last summer by
Congress, but the administration hasn't yet pushed hard for the
talks.
   Both House and Senate members have criticized Western Europe and
Japan for failing to spend more on defense. They note that the
United States spends about 6.9 percent of its gross national
product on defense, a far larger share than other western nations.
   Despite the criticism, Congress has refused for three years to
order sanctions against Japan and the alliance, a refusal that was
continued Friday by the House.
   The United States has about 326,000 troops stationed in Europe
and 63,000 in Japan.
   By a 240-120 vote, the House rejected a proposal by Rep. John
Bryant, D-Texas, to bring 30,000 troops a year back from Europe and
7,000 troops a year from Japan starting in 1991.
   Minutes later it voted 332-21 to reject a plan by Rep. Tommy
Robinson, D-Ark., to withdraw 70,000 troops a year from Europe.
   ``Let's get smart and begin to tell our allies that we expect
them to pay their fair share,'' Bryant said. ``We are subsidizing
their defense.''
   Robinson made a similar appeal, telling his colleagues: ``The
real purpose of this amendment is to demonstrate to our allies that
we've had it. These people are stealing our jobs because we have
been suckered into paying for their defense.''
   But Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said the issue should be
``considered in a clear process and not on an emotional basis.''
   ``It is simply not possible to maintain the viability of a
voluntary alliance of free countries if one of those countries
tries to impose standards on the others,'' said Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-N.Y.
   But Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said, ``It's time Uncle Sam quit
being taken for Uncle Sucker.''
   The spending bill would authorize the Pentagon to spend $299.5
billion in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, which is the same
amount proposed by the separate bill that will be considered next
month by the Senate. Differences between the bills eventually will
be reconciled by a House-Senate conference committee.
   The Pentagon report said that the 6.1 percent of gross national
product spent by Greece for defense in 1986 was the closest to the
U.S. share.
   England was third with 5.1 percent, followed by Turkey at 4.8
percent and France at 3.9 percent.
   ``All of the remaining nations have shares of 3.2 percent or
less,'' the study found.
   The report used 1986 data because that is the most recent year
for which figures were available.

   A Senate ethics panel says comments by Sen.
David Durenberger on an espionage case hurt relations between
Congress and intelligence agencies, but Durenberger says the harm
already had been done by the late CIA chief William Casey.
   Durenberger was chastised Friday by the Senate Ethics Committee
as it closed an investigation that began last year after the
Minnesota Republican publicly discussed an espionage case involving
the United States and Israel.
   The committee told Durenberger in a letter: ``The Ethics
Committee has determined that your statements gave the appearance
that you were disclosing sensitive national security information
and such appearance jeopardized the mutual confidence which must
exist between the Congress and the intelligence community. ...
   ``Because the committee has concluded that your actions were not
intentional, deliberate, nor attended with gross negligence, and
because of the particular facts of this case, we will not recommend
that the Senate take institutional action against you. However, the
committee wants to make it clear that it does not condone your
actions.''
   The ethics investigation centered on comments Durenberger made
at an event sponsored by the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee in Palm Beach, Fla., on March 15, 1987.
   Durenberger reportedly disclosed to the group that Casey in 1982
had ``changed the rules'' under which allies did not spy on each
other by recruiting an Israeli military officer to spy on Israel
for the United States.
   Durenberger's comments were said to be aimed at giving context
to the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard, an American convicted of
spying on the United States for Israel.
   Durenberger said he based his remarks on newspaper accounts and
maintained that he exercised ``due care'' in preparation for the
speech.
   The former chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence
issued a statement saying he was pleased that the committee had
concluded its investigation and determined that no action was
necessary. But he added:
   ``The late CIA Director William Casey's fundamental disagreement
over the philosophy of congressional oversight led to frequent
clashes with the Intelligence Committee.
   ``Director Casey was a strong leader, loyal to his own view of
the public interest, but his belief that Congress should play
little or no role in intelligence oversight led to a lack of mutual
confidence long before March 1987.''
   He added, ``I respectfully disagree with the ethic committee's
conclusion that my statements gave the appearance that I was
disclosing sensitive information.''
   Sources present at the Palm Beach meeting and who said they took
careful notes reported that Durenberger said the CIA recruited its
Israeli spy after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. The spy passed
along sensitive information about the invasion, Durenberger
reportedly told the group.
   In a separate statement Friday, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., said Durenberger ``was an excellent chairman during one of
the most demanding and crucial periods for intelligence oversight.
I had just as much confidence in Dave before the Ethics Committee
examination as I do right now.''
   The Ethics Committee letter was signed by Sens. Howell Heflin,
D-Ala., David Pryor, D-Ark, Terry Sanford, D-N.C., Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., Jesse Helms, R-N.C. and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.

<TEXT>
   The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration wants employers to put warning tags on machinery
that has been shut off to prevent injuries and deaths caused when
the machines are turned on while being cleaned or serviced.
   Nine years and 1,000 deaths after unions first pleaded for
action on one of the single biggest causes of industrial accidents,
the agency issued proposed regulations Friday on so-called
``tagouts'' and ``lockouts.''
   The proposals appeared in the Federal Register a week after
Senate Labor Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
the delay showed the Reagan administration's ``decision to let
workers die while waiting on a standard.''
   OSHA officials testified last week at a Senate hearing chaired
by Kennedy that the proposed regulations had been completed by the
agency in early 1987 but had languished at the White House for
nearly a year.
   About 7 percent of all occupational fatalities and 2 per cent of
accident-caused injuries in the workplace occur now because such
equipment is inadvertently restarted while someone is working on it.
   The agency estimated Friday that the so-called
``performance-oriented'' regulations will save 122 lives and
prevent 60,000 job injuries a year. But they would require
employers only to follow certain steps in turning off equipment and
``minimize'' the potential for inadvertently reactivating it.
   ``Very simple lockout, tagout measures, which taken only a few
minutes, can prevent up to 10 percent of all the serious injuries
in some major manufacturing industries,'' said Assistant Labor
Secretary John A. Pendergrass.
   Agency officials estimated it will be a minimum of another year
before the regulations are actually enacted.
   Unions had begun petitioning the agency for the regulations in
1979.
   John Molovich, a safety specialist for the United Steelworkers
Union, predicted employers will ignore the guidelines and ``take
the cheapest way out'' by using cardboard warning tags instead of
locks to prevent a machine from being turned on.
   ``There will be no positive means of assuring that the equipment
won't start,'' he said.
   The regulations, if adopted in current form, will apply to only
1.6 million employers and cover only 39 million workers, most of
them in manufacturing. OSHA estimated the annual cost of compliance
to businesses at $135 million.
   Exempted are millions of companies and workers in agriculture,
oil and gas drilling, electric utilities, the maritime industry and
construction. OSHA said protections for them will be included in
other regulations to be proposed later.
   James Scully, an OSHA official who worked on the regulations for
more than a decade, testified at the Senate Labor Committee
hearings last week that the agency had first seen a need for them
back in 1977.
   But OSHA took no serious action until 1979, when the United Auto
Workers Union, reacting to the deaths of 22 of its members in
related accidents the previous five years, formally asked the
government for emergency action.
   OSHA denied that request and similar pleas in 1982 and 1986 from
other unions.

   A New York artist was named as the winner of a
nationwide contest to create a new image of the Madonna for
Chicago's oldest Roman Catholic Church.
   Bryan Hunt's entry, a pair of oil, pastel and graphite panels
titled ``Madonna and Child I and II,'' was selected as the best of
more than 400 entries sent by the nation's artists to Old St.
Patrick's Church.
   The Rev. Jack Wall, pastor of Old St. Patrick's, announced
Friday that Hunt's work was chosen from a field of 17 finalists by
a jury of art critics and curators, including a representative of
the church.
   ``We are very pleased with the jurors' selection,'' Wall said.
``We were seeking a dramatic way to relook at Mary in the Catholic
church, and we have found it in this winning piece.''
   As winner, Hunt will receive a purchase price of $10,000 for the
two panels, which each measure 22 by 33 inches.

   Tens of thousands of Christian activists
braved cold, damp weather to hear a message of support from
President Reagan as they prayed for ``the sins of the nation'' and
the scandal-plagued evangelical movement.
   ``It has been prayer which has strengthened this nation to

   U.S. Park Police estimated that the dawn-to-dusk ``Washington

of the crowd. They said they hoped the gathering would show all
Americans that Christians remain as ardent and unified as ever,
despite the well-publicized downfall of television evangelists
Jimmy Swaggart and Jim and Tammy Bakker.
   ``The world thought the scandals of the last year brought the
church to its knees,'' James Kennedy of Coral Ridge Presbyterian
Church in Florida said. ``The church will arise from its knees,
cleaner and purer and stronger.''
   The gathering was meant to be non-political, which was why
organizers said Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson was
not invited. Robertson was one of the main speakers at a similar
rally in Washington eight years ago.
   In fact, Reagan was the only national political figure to speak
to the crowd.
   ``Today, American society must face serious problems, from
within and without, which threaten to steal our liberties and
destroy our freedoms,'' Reagan said. ``Abortion, child abuse,
pornography and drug addiction eat away at our most precious
national resource _ our children.
   ``Yet we do not falter in the face of such evil for there is a
wind of prayer blowing throughout our land.''
   Earlier, evangelist Oral Roberts of Tulsa, Okla., made a brief
speech recalling how ``a man of God'' laid hands on him and cured
him of tuberculosis when he was 17.
   ``I stand here today, 53 years later with my lungs sound and
whole, my body healed by the power of God,'' he said as members of
the audience applauded.
   One of the first speakers of the day was the Rev. Gerald
Derstine of Bradenton, Fla., who urged ``Christians to offer
prayers of ``repentance for the sins of the naion.''
   ``I am talking about drug addiction, alcoholism and suicides. We
feel prayer in the schools is still an important issue and we
believe abortion still is an issue,'' Derstine said.
   Such sentiments were echoed in the banners and signs carried by
rally participants. One banner said, ``Take drugs out of our
schools and put God back in.'' Another sign said, ``Jesus forgives
sinning, let him.''
   One of the rally-goers, Michael Goldbloom, assistant pastor of
Full Gospel Tabernacle in Philadelphia, said he thought it
significant that the rally was being held in the nation's capital.
``I believe a public display of prayer and repentence will let
Washington know and the country know that people still love God,''
he said.

   An indicted New York City mobster says La Cosa
Nostra families use murder to enforce their internal rules, but
insists, ``We don't kill innocent people.''
   Vincent ``The Fish'' Cafaro, who was a ``soldier'' in the
Genovese organized crime family, told senators Friday the
organization was ``very disciplined'' and members paid a high price
for breaking the rules.
   ``Killings were mandatory'' for fooling around with another
member's wife and dealing in drugs, he said.
   ``When it comes to an amico nostra's wife or `junk' there was no
talk,'' Cafaro said. An amico nostra is a member of a mob family,
and ``junk'' means narcotics.
   Cafaro said mob members also could get murdered for ``ratting,
refusing to go on a `hit' if asked or knowingly killing a cop or
other law enforcement agent.''
   To win approval to carry out a murder, Cafaro said, mob members
had to go through the chain of command, right up to the boss of the
family.
   But he insisted, ``We don't kill innocent people.''
   Unlike witnesses who spoke from behind a screen, Cafaro _ a
thin, balding man with glasses _ testified in full public view
before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
   He currently is in custody while awaiting trial in New York on
racketeering, extortion and conspiracy charges. After his arrest in
1986, he cooperated with federal authorities and even carried a
concealed microphone while talking to other mobsters.
   But Cafaro said personal safety concerns have persuaded him to
end the effort, and he was heavily guarded in the hearing room.
   ``I'm fair game, no question about it,'' he said.
   Cafaro said he had worked for the mob since 1958, as an
associate of ``Fat Tony'' Salerno, a major figure in the Genovese
family. Salerno, who Cafaro said was ``like a father to me,'' is
now on trial in New York on charges related to mob activities.
   Cafaro also told the committee, headed by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
that four organized crime families run the high-rise construction
industry in New York City through control over the concrete
industry and construction unions.
   He said bids were rigged, and that contractors and unions
winning construction jobs had to kick back 2 percent of the
contract price to the mob.
   Cafaro said the system was arranged through the ```2 Percent
Club,'' an organization run by the Genovese, Gambino, Lucchese and
Colombo families.
   He estimated that at least 50 percent of the high-rise
construction in New York had a mob connection and added,
``Legitimate guys ain't got a chance'' to win contracts for those
buildings.
   Cafaro said each of the four mob families had an expert on the
construction business in the organization. Members read the Dodge
Reports, a construction trade publication that lists upcoming jobs,
he said.
   ``The club members split up all of the jobs over $2 million,''
he said. But if the contract went over $5 million, it went to a
mob-run company, S & A Concrete, he said.
   When the smaller contractors complained of the arrangement, he
said, they won the right to split all jobs over $3 million.
   As a mob soldier who turned down promotions because he didn't
want the added responsibility, Cafaro said he preferred to run the
numbers business in West Harlem.
   ``I had some bad years, but in a good year I could make as much
as $2 million or more,'' he said.
   When Nunn asked if he kept the money, Cafaro said: ``I spent it.
I gave it away. I loaned a lot of money to people and never got it
back.'' The mobster said he only carried cash.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Unchanged From March To April</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A preliminary report for April shows that
prices farmers got for raw products were unchanged, on average, for
the second month in a row but were still 4 percent above a year ago.
   But the report Friday by the Agriculture Department also said
that farm production expenses have crept higher in recent months.
   ``Prices were higher for soybeans, cattle, hay and oranges, and
lower for lettuce, eggs, milk and strawberries,'' the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said.
   New quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet
expenses were up 1.8 percent from January and averaged 3.7 percent
more than in April 1987.
   ``Higher prices for feeder pigs, fertilizer, agricultural
chemicals, tractors and other machinery contributed most to the
increase from January,'' the report said.
   Department economists say net cash income of farmers set a
record in 1987 of about $57 billion. This year's net _ the
difference between cash receipts and cash expenses _ may be in the
range of $50 billion to $55 billion.
   Consumer food prices are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent
this year, compared with a 4.1 percent average increase in 1987.
   According to the preliminary April figures, based mostly on
mid-month averages, the index for livestock and livestock products
was unchanged from March but was up 0.7 percent from a year ago.
   ``Higher prices for cattle, calves and broilers were offset by
lower prices for eggs, milk and hogs,'' the report said.
   Crop prices overall were up 0.9 percent from March and averaged
9.9 percent more than a year ago.
   The price index for oil-bearing crops, which consist mainly of
soybeans, was up 3.3 percent from March and averaged 22 percent
more than in April 1987. Soybeans prices, at $6.36 per bushel, were
up 30 cents during the month.
   Prices paid to commercial vegetable growers, overall, dropped
4.4 percent from March and also were down 4.4 percent from a year
ago.
   The prices of most individual vegetables rose from March to
April, but those increases were more than offset by a sharp drop
for lettuce and a seasonal decline in asparagus prices.
   April farm commodity prices averaged 130 percent of a 1977 base
used for comparison, according to the preliminary figures, the same
as in March and February. A year ago the April index was 125
percent.
   The quarterly parity ratio was reported at 51 percent in April,
down two percentage points from the revised January reading of 53
percent. The revised parity ratio for April 1987 also was 51
percent.
   Although many economists say the old parity standard is outmoded
because it doesn't take into full account changes in farm
productivity, others contend the ratio is useful in comparing
year-to-year changes.
   Under the parity formula, prices farmers get for commodities are
compared with prices they pay to meet expenses. It then uses a
1910-14 measurement to express what happened. At 100 percent, the
indicator would theoretically mean farmers had the same buying
power as they had in 1910-14.
   For example, the average price of wheat in April was $2.81 per
bushel, according to the preliminary figures. That was 40 percent
of the parity price of $7.07 per bushel.
   The report also said:
   _Cattle averaged $68.90 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $68.30 in March and above the $62.60 reported
for April 1987. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as
beef.
   _Hogs averaged $41.80 per 100 pounds, compared with $42.20 in
March and $50.80 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $1.85 a bushel, was down from $1.86 in March, but was
up from the average of $1.52 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.81 per bushel, compared with $2.74 in March and $2.63 a
year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $8.41 per 100 pounds, compared with $8.79 in
March and $3.63 a year earlier.
   _Soybeans were $6.36 per bushel, compared with $6.06 in March
and $4.90 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 57.3 cents per pound, compared
with 57.7 in March and 50.4 cents in April 1987.
   _Eggs were 45.5 cents per dozen, compared with 50.8 cents in
March and 54.8 cents a year earlier.
   _Milk was $11.70 per 100 pounds, compared with $11.90 in March
and $12.20 a year earlier.
   _Broilers were 28 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
27.5 cents in March and 29.2 cents a year ago.

   The senior prom returned to Forrest
City High School on Friday, more than 25 years after it was banned
by school officials.
   ``I'm gonna do Da Bump,'' John Williams, an 18-year-old senior,
said as he made his appearance at the Forrest City Civic Center
dressed all in white but for a black snap-brim hat and black cane.
   The last prom was in 1962, said Principal Oscar Collins, who
helped plan the last one as a senior class sponsor early in his
career.
   He said he didn't know what had prompted the ban _ ``I was just
a teacher at the time'' _ noting that it wouldn't have been a
racial issue because the first black student didn't enter the
school until 1965.
   ``That was before integration. After that, the board voted not
to have them any more,'' Collins said.
   However, the student council officers decided not to have a king
and queen for the new prom partly because the couple might be
racially mixed, the Arkansas Gazette reported Friday.
   The newspaper's assertion was disputed by Kaki Dunn, 17,
recording secretary for the council. ``We decided not to have a
prom king and queen because we feel that we're all kings and
queens,'' she said. ``We talked about it and said, `No, we don't
want to do that.'''
   More than half the 355 seniors were expected to attend the dance
in the Forrest City Civic Center, Student Council President
Tangella Brown said.
   Assistant Principal Tom Bridges said he expected the crowd to be
about evenly divided between black and white students, like the
composition of the 1,450-student school.
   ``I don't think that's even been thought about,'' Bridges said.
   The town of about 14,000, 45 miles west of Memphis, Tenn., is
about evenly divided between black and white.
   The boys wore black, white or gray but the colors of the girls'
gowns ranged across the spectrum and skirt lengths were anywhere
between the ankles and the knees.
   Three couples stepped out of a stretch limouisine from a funeral
home, the driver holding the door. Then, at the request of a TV
crew, they got back in and did it again.
   Jack McNair, 18, sharply dressed in an Army Junior ROTC uniform,
came all the way from Benton, 125 miles to the west, to escort his
cousin, Lori Martin, 18.
   Precautions were taken to avoid any problems at the prom,
Bridges said.
   ``There'll be strictly no drinking,'' he said. ``We don't allow
smoking anyway, at the school, so there'll be no smoking at the
prom, no drinking, no drugs.'' Students who leave the prom will not
be able to return, he said.
   ``And there won't be any press or anything like that,'' Bridges
said. ``It's going to be strictly for the kids.''
   The Forrest City School Board voted last fall to allow the
Student Council to sponsor a prom for 1988's graduating seniors.
   ``We just thought it was time for us to do like other folks,''
school board member Bill Baxter said after that meeting.
   ``It's a milestone,'' said Mayor Danny Ferguson, a 1967 graduate
of the school. ``People in Forrest City are pulling together to
project a positive image.''
   No dances have been sponsored by the school since 1962, not even
informal hops in the gym, Ms. Brown said this week.
   ``They've had them, but they were provided by different
fraternities or different sororities,'' said Ms. Brown, 17, who is
black. ``But as for those provided by the school, this will be the
first.''
   The private dances, Collins said, have been strictly black or
white affairs, none of them integrated.
   The theme chosen for the prom was ``A Night on the Town,'' said
Bridges.
   ``They've got skyscrapers and all that,'' he said. ``It'll look
pretty good.''

<HEAD>Reagan Administration Soft-Pedals Bowen Pessimism On Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Otis R. Bowen, in a move
acknowledged by the White House to be ``a little unusual,'' is
taking public issue with the assertion that the administration is
winning the war on drugs.
   ``Generally speaking, Mr. President, I prefer optimism to
pessimism, as you do,'' Bowen told Reagan and three Cabinet
colleagues at a meeting of the National Drug Policy Board. ``But
today, I don't know how I can honestly be very optimistic about the
war on drugs.''
   Bowen said Reagan's leadership has resulted in ``major gains.''
   ``We're winning some battles,'' he said, ``but it's difficult
for me to say we're winning the war, especially when we consider
drug dealing and use in our streets and our homes.''
   A text of Bowen's remarks at the private White House meeting on
Thursday was made public Friday by the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater acknowledged afterward
that it was ``a little unusual'' for a Cabinet officer to go public
with remarks delivered to the president in a private meeting.
   But he sought to soft-pedal any differences between Reagan and
Bowen.
   ``That's the same thing the president said _ we've made progress
but obviously we need to do more,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``I don't know what he's up to,'' Fitzwater said of Bowen's
action. ``On the other hand, there's nothing wrong with it.''
   Reagan often has been upbeat about the war on drugs. ``With all
the headlines about how we're losing the drug war, let's keep in
mind the progress we've made,'' he told a White House Conference
for a Drug-Free America on Feb. 29, adding, ``We've strengthened
the laws'' and ``drug seizures are at an all-time high.''
   Bowen backed the administration's call for tougher law
enforcement in his Thursday presentation, but he also called for
more attention to effective treatment and strong federal leadership
to establish additional treatment clinics.
   And he made clear there was a pragmatic political component to
his appeal.
   ``Mr. President, there are political dangers as well,'' said the
HHS chief.
   In a clear refererence to Jesse Jackson, Bowen said, ``One of
the two remaining Democrat candidates for president is getting some
of his highest marks for his passionate and creative oratory on the
drug epidemic and is poised to steal from our party what has been a
traditional Republican issue _ law enforcement.''
   Bowen supported aggressive law enforcement and other approaches
such as first lady Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No'' campaign, but he
said ``some'' are using the first lady's campaign ``as a political
football, saying it's an empty slogan, however unfair that
characterization might be.''
   He went on: ``I believe as we approach the end of this second
term, we need to take a fresh look at what we're doing to secure a
lasting end to the demand for illicit drugs.''
   He called for more research to improve the efficiency of
treatment strategies and expanded treatment facilities.
   ``On the topic of treatment,'' Bowen said, ``we also need to
talk turkey with big-city mayors, councils, and suburban
jurisdictions as well, who often knuckle under to pressure from
those who are, quote-unquote, `all for treatment, as long as it's
not in my backyard.'
   ``Communities and neighborhoods need to be willing to accept
treatment facilities,'' he said. ``In some instances, (federal)
funding is available, it's just not being used.''
   Among those at the Thursday meeting were Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, Education Secretary William Bennett and Transportation
Secretary Jim Burnley.

<HEAD>Hijackers Still In Algeria, US Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gunmen who hijacked a Kuwaiti Airways
jumbo jet for 15 days remain in Algeria, where the ordeal ended
last week after a Kuwaiti promise to give ``early release'' to a
handful of Shiite Moslem prisoners, according to a U.S. account.
   On Thursday, Algerian Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun said the
hijackers had left Algeria without getting what they wanted and
without obtaining any concessions for freeing the 31 remaining
passengers.
   But two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Friday the
hijackers had been promised that five or six of the 17 prisoners
held in Kuwait for bomb attacks on the U.S. and French embassies in
1983 would be released early.
   However, the prisoners have not been released and the gunmen,
who had been promised safe passage, remain in Algeria, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
   According to this account of the negotiations, Algerian
intermediaries faithfully conveyed Kuwait's promise to the
hijackers. But the officials said Kuwait, which has a firm policy
of not yielding to terrorism, may not have had any intention of
letting the prisoners go in the first place.
   ``They have stood so fast for so long, they probably had no
intention of letting them go early,'' one of the officials said.
   The five-year prison terms of three of the 17 Shiite Moslems are
due to expire at the end of the year.
   During the long ordeal, the United States repeatedly urged
Kuwait publicly and privately not to yield to the hijackers. The
Reagan administration was not aware of the terms to end the siege
because they were worked out through Algerian intermediaries, the
officials said.
   The account was provided by Algeria, which has played a role in
resolving several hijackings, in diplomatic contacts with the
United States in the aftermath of the hijacking.
   Sahnoun also said that while his government would have liked to
apprehend the hijackers, such a move would have damaged its
credibility as a mediator in international crises such as attempts
to obtain the release of the eight American hostages in Lebanon.
   Sahnoun, addressing reporters at the National Press Club here,
said the hijackers ``went back without achieving anything.''
   The Kuwaiti press agency also said on April 20 that the
hijackers _ there were believed to be eight or nine _ had probably
been flown to Lebanon or Iran.
   But the U.S. officials told The Associated Press the gunmen had
remained in Algeria.
   Another U.S. official, interviewed separately, said Syria had
assured the United States that despite reports to the contrary, the
hijackers had not been flown from Algeria to Damascus. Reports from
Algiers had said the terrorists were flown to Damascus, from where
they made their way by land to Lebanon.
   The State Department has identified one of the hijackers as
Hassan Izz-al-Din and said he might have been involved in the
killing of Navy diver Robert Stethem in the hijacking of a TWA
jetliner in 1985.
   He was charged by a federal grand jury in seizing the plane.
   This raises a possibility of a U.S. request for extradition.
Also, Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said one of the
passengers may have had dual U.S. citizenship.
   He condemned the hijackers last week as murderers.
   The plane, a Boeing 747 with 112 passengers and crew members,
was hijacked April 5 on a flight from Thailand to Kuwait and spent
several days in Meshed, Iran, and Larnaca, Cyprus, before flying to
Algiers.
   Two Kuwaiti passengers were killed and their bodies dumped from
the plane while it was in Cyprus.
   The hijackers' principal demand was the release of the 17
prisoners in Kuwait. The freed hostages included three members of
the Kuwaiti royal family.

<HEAD>Spain's Prime Minister Urges More Respect for His `Awakening'
Country</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Spanish prime minister has a message
for Americans who think Spain is a sleepy, dusty country crippled
by years of dictatorship.
   Felipe Gonzalez, who was elected in 1982, is in the United
States making what amounts to an announcement that his country
should no longer be considered the Rodney Dangerfield of Europe.
Spain wants some respect.
   ``We'd like to change the nature of relations between the United
States and Spain,'' Gonzalez said Friday, speaking through an
interpreter in his hotel room. ``Above all, we want Spain to be
accepted by the United States as we are now. Spain is going to be
economically sound by the end of the century.''
   The year 1992, Gonzalez said, marks Spain's ``awakening'' from
Francisco Franco's 36-year rule that ended with Franco's death in
1975.
   In four years, the Summer Olympics will be held in Barcelona, a
World's Fair will take place in Seville and the 500th anniversary
of Christopher Columbus' voyage will be celebrated in Madrid.
   The year 1992 also marks the completion of Spain's integration
into the European Economic Community.
   ``Over the last 10 years that have gone by, the economy has
begun producing rapidly,'' said Gonzalez. ``Spain for over half a
century had a hyper-protectionist economy but now that it's opened
up we've seen rapid development and economic growth. This is what
we want to communicate to the U.S.''
   On Thursday, speaking at Harvard University, Gonzalez said Spain
was part of a growing political and economic union in Western
Europe that could lead to a stronger NATO alliance.
   However, the 46-year-old prime minister said it will take time
for Spain to recover from Franco's regime. At present, the per
capita income in Spain is less than half of West Germany's, he said.

<TEXT>
   A judge Friday allowed Tuskegee University
to bar students who owe more than $300 in overdue fees from taking
final exams, a school spokesman said.
   Judge Howard F. Bryan of Macon County dissolved the restraining
order he had issued Wednesday against enforcement of the policy,
said J.J. Johnson.
   Students who owe more than $300 on Monday _ when final exams
begin _ will not be allowed to take their tests, Johnson said.
   University officials testified Friday that 600 students owed
more than $300 in fees, said Michael Pintard, president of the
Student Government Association. The judge ordered Tuskegee to open
its business office all day Saturday and part of Sunday so students
could make payments on overdue fees, Johnson said.
   The university announced earlier that abuse of an installment
plan had prompted it to enforce its policy barring students with
overdue fees from attending class or taking exams. Officials
estimated 2,000 students owe almost $1.5 million.
   The crackdown had sparked a week of protests, including a sit-in
at the administration building last weekend.
   Student leaders said the university should have warned students
earlier about the crackdown and should have allowed students in
financial difficulty to work out a timetable for repayment.
   Pintard calling the judge's ruling Friday a ``serious
miscarriage of justice.''
   University President Benjamin Payton said the ruling
``underscores the fact that when students make loans they have to
pay them.''
   ``What everybody needs to be clear about, however, is this is
not a case of Tuskegee University fighting its students,'' Payton
said. ``It's a case of Tuskegee University insisting that students
learn very important lessons for life.''

<HEAD>Monthlong King Pilgrimage to Wind Up in Atlanta Today</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rally scheduled for 2 p.m.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month-long, multi-state journey that began on
the 20th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. was headed for the city of his birth today to close with a
``Jobs with Justice'' rally.
   Thousands of civil rights activists, church congregants and
labor union members were expected to join the group of about 30
marchers at the afternoon rally at the Atlanta Civic Center,
organizers said.
   The pilgrimage, organized by the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference founded by King, started in Memphis, Tenn., on April 5 _
one day after a memorial service there in memory of the slain civil
rights leader.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the SCLC, said at the
outset that he wanted to draw attention to the plight of the poor,
which was a major concern of King's at the time of his death.
   ``We're trying to stir up the countryside,'' Lowery said.
``We're trying to bring people out to express their outrage about
poverty.''
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who was a close aide to King, was
scheduled to welcome the rally today. Among the scheduled speakers
were Lowery, Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Jim Hightower and a
representative of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent
Social Change. Folk singers Peter, Paul & Mary were expected to
perform.
   King was fatally shot on a balcony of the Lorraine Motel in
Memphis on April 4, 1968.
   The pilgrimage, which started with about 30 marchers, has
included marches and rallies in towns along the route through
Alabama and Georgia on the way to Atlanta, King's birthplace. Most
of the trail has been covered in vans, with short marches at each
destination.

   Washington National landed on top in a study of
passenger convenience and amenities at the nation's 20 busiest
airports, Money magazine said in its May issue.
   Washington got high marks for being easy to reach _ only four
miles from downtown _ and for the nation's third best on-time
record. Next are Phoenix Sky Harbor International and Boston's
Logan International, both close to downtown and ranked high on
amenities.
   John F. Kennedy International and Newark International, both
serving New York City, rated last. Both are low on amenities and
costly to reach from the city _ $22 or $28 by taxi, Money said.
   ``Airports have as much, if not more, to do with the quality of
air travel as the airlines they serve,'' said Money, which studied
federal flight-delay data and sent a team of reporters to airports.
   In separate listings, Money also picked the best and worst
airports overall. They included:
   _Washington National, best airport to fly to; Dallas-Fort Worth
International, the worst.
   _Phoenix's Sky Harbor, best airport ``to get stuck at'' because
of its amenities and ``distinct Southwest flavor''; Atlanta, the
worst.

   If you're crazy like a duck and don't mind
cigar smoke, harp music and horns there's only one place to be
today _ Fredonia.
   That's Fredonia with one ``e'' as in this western New York
college town and not Freedonia with two ``E's'' as in the mythical
kingdom of Freedonia that served as the setting for the Marx
Brothers' 1933 movie ``Duck Soup.''
   If that seems confusing, think how confused Mayor Harry B.
Hickey must have been in 1933 when he sent a letter to Paramount
Pictures complaining about the studio's ``intentions in using the
name of our city in your picture'' and got back the following reply
from the Marx Brothers themselves:
   ``Your excellency. Our advice is that you change the name of
your town. It is hurting our picture. What makes you think you are
mayor of Fredonia? Do you wear a black moustache, play the harp,
speak with an Italian accent or chase girls like Harpo? We are
certain you do not. Therefore, we must be the mayor of Fredonia,
not you.''
   Fredonia today celebrates the second annual ``Freedonia Marxonia
Film Festival and Symposium.''
   Several hundred people wearing Groucho glasses and noses are
expected at Fredonia State College for a group picture in the
afternoon. But that's not all.
   There will be a speech by Marx Brothers expert Paul G.
Wesolowski and a duck soup recipe competition. The local Post
Office will cancel stamps with a mark that shows Groucho, Harpo and
Chico and has the extra ``e'' in Fredonia.
   Postmaster Robert Kaus says he's gotten about 150 requests for
the cancellation, some from as far away as Belgium, Italy, and the
Soviet Union.

   Twelve-year-old Steven Young was just
doodling with a pencil at his desk, but his teacher thought the
drawings could be put to use.
   Steven wound up having lunch with a group of auto executives who
said his classroom doodles showed promise for a dual-spring
suspension system for heavy-duty vehicles.
   His seventh-grade teacher, Sandra Hefner, and Honeysuckle Middle
School principal Sam Nichols turned to local engineers at Michelin
Tire Corp. for guidance on the drawings.
   The company invited all three to lunch Thursday where they
discussed the possible uses of the youngster's design.
   Dan Conn, an engineer for Michelin, said the design probably is
over-engineered for an ordinary passenger car, but it might enhance
the performance of a heavy-duty vehicle or racing car needing extra
strength.
   Steven's father, Jeffery Young, is an engineer at Great Southern
Paper Co. and his mother, Kathy Young, is a kindergarten teacher.
They said he's always wanted to know how things work.

   Old planning boards don't die _ or
apparently fade away either. That's what members of the Regional
Solid Waste Planning Board are discovering.
   Some members believe the board has served its purpose and should
be disbanded. But officials say they can't get enough people
together for a quorum to officially close up shop.
   ``I'm just tired of meeting here every few months to find out we
can't do anything,'' said Roy Jones, board vice chairman. ``The
board is well on its way to melting away. It should be terminated
with the same dignity as it was formed.''
   The board, with representatives from communities in the Tulsa
area, was one member short of a quorum at its meeting Thursday.
Only 16 of 60 board members attended the previous meeting in
February.
   The board was formed in 1986 to investigate the area's solid
waste situation and propose sites for landfills.
   ``This conceivably could go on forever, if enough member
communities play the game of not attending meetings, but not
resigning,'' said Marilyn Hinkle, board chairman.
   The board will try to meet again, probably in September, with
disbanding on the agenda, she said.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at a
record high Saturday for the second consecutive trading day.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
242.15 points Thursday, added another 75.42 points, or 0.16
percent, to finish Saturday's half-day session at 27,509.54.
   ``The Tokyo market has been in good, stable condition without
any bad news to prompt selling,'' said a stock analyst for a major
brokerage, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Japanese yen's stability on foreign exchange markets also
has helped boost stock prices, he said.
   Trading was a relatively quiet 450 million shares on the
market's first section Saturday because of the holiday-studded
``Golden Week'' which started Friday, traders said. During
Thursday's full-day session, 800 million shares were traded.
   Popular issues included electricals, machineries and chemicals.
Foodstuffs, textiles and real estates also gained ground, while
some drugs and banks declined.
   Most major Japanese financial institutions will be closed
Wednesday through Friday because of holidays.
   The Tokyo foreign exchange market normally is closed on
Saturdays.

   The first California condor conceived in
captivity hatched Friday, its keepers using tweezers and their
fingertips to help the newest member of the nearly extinct species
break free from its shell, officials said.
   ``It's alive and it looks healthy,'' said Tom Hanscom, a
spokesman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park. ``It's resting now.
We don't have any other details.''
   The hatching represents a tremendous boost to efforts to save
the species. It brings the known population of North America's
largest land bird to 28, all in captivity _ 15 at the park here and
13 at the Los Angeles Zoo.
   The squawking infant, named Molloko, an Indian word for
``condor,'' was swaddled in a towel and placed in the same type of
incubator used for premature infants.
   ``Early this morning there were 27 California condors left in
the world,'' said Bill Toone, curator of birds at the park. ``This
afternoon there's 28 of them, and we couldn't be more excited about
that.
   ``When the numbers are so low, one bird is seen as a very big
step away from extinction,'' Toone added.
   Although the tiny bird was not brought forth to ``meet the
press,'' its history-making birth was recorded on videotape and
shown at a press conference Friday night.
   Earlier, the chick had become stuck in dried membrane and
albumen and could no longer rotate in the shell to peck its way
out. Its keepers removed it cautiously because of the danger of
rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes.
   A recording of vultures making hissing and grunting sounds was
played at intervals to duplicate the sounds the chick would hear in
a natural setting.
   Park officials had said they intended to intervene by Saturday
if the chick, which began hatching Wednesday, hadn't emerged from
the shell. Allowing the hatching struggle to continue would
overexhaust the bird.
   The chick, conceived by the only known activing breeding pair of
the California condor, was expected to weigh about 9 ounces,
Hanscom said. The species has a wingspan of up to 10 feet at
maturity.
   The 10-ounce blue-green egg, about 5 inches long, had been under
a 24-hour watch since Wednesday, when keepers noticed ``pip''
cracks in one end signaling the start of hatching, which can take
three days.
   After the egg was laid March 3, it was taken away from the
parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female
bird would produce a second egg. So far, this has not happened.
   It will be a while before the sex of the bird can be determined
through a blood test, officials said.
   Hanscom said that representatives of the Chumash Indian tribe
had been enlisted to select the name for the chick upon hatching.
   The tribe inhabited the Santa Barbara area that most recently
served as California condor habitat, and the bird figures
prominently in the tribe's religion.

<HEAD>Producer Ray Stark Gives Siskel and Ebert Two Thumbs Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producer Ray Stark, stung by negative reviews
of ``Biloxi Blues'' from televison movie critics Gene Siskel and
Roger Ebert, has sent the two a letter calling them a ``critical
version of Laurel and Hardy.''
   ``Your thumb system is a clever bit of show business; I suggest
you sit on them,'' Stark said, referring to the pair's trademark
``thumbs up'' or ``thumbs down'' method of evaluation.
   Siskel responded that someone perhaps had purloined Stark's
stationery to write a rude note.
   Stark, calling the two a ``critical version of Laurel and
Hardy,'' said he will suggest to fellow producers that they refrain
from offering early screenings to the pair.
   ``Biloxi Blues,'' about an Army recruit from Brooklyn who gets
his basic training in the Deep South, is based on a play by Neil
Simon, stars Matthew Broderick and was directed by Mike Nichols.
Stark is the head of Rastar Productions, which produced the film.
   In an April 20 letter to Siskel at the Chicago Tribune, Stark
recounts several positive reviews of ``Biloxi Blues'' that appeared
in the New York Times, Time magazine, the Washington Post, Los
Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune.
   But ``there on television was Roger Ebert saying `I realized to
my shock that his (Nichols) career has gone nowhere in recent
years. ... What has happened to him as a director? ... He's just
another one of the hacks brought in to direct another Neil Simon
screenplay.'
   ``And there were you agreeing, `I think the word hack is right.
... I was very shocked at how dull the film was,''' Stark wrote to
Siskel.
   ``For such men of the world, the two of you shock very easily,''
said Stark in the three-page letter, listing a number of problems
such as Middle East tensions, AIDS, and homelessness.
   The letter was sent to the heads of several major studios.
   In a letter obtained by the Washington Post, Siskel replied to
Stark and referred to an earlier, apparently friendlier, letter.
   ``I think you should know that someone using your name and good
stationery has just violated the reasonable opinions of the earlier
letter you sent me,'' Siskel wrote. ``I suggest that you have
someone stand guard at your desk to make sure that no crackpot gets
ahold of your letterhead.''

   Workers glared with icy determination at
platoons of plainclothes police as they streamed out through the
gates of the huge strike-bound Lenin steelworks during a shift
change.
   Striding toward a bus stop, a few flashed the V-for-victory sign
once out of sight of police. Their strike at the plant in the
Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta has shaken the government at the highest
level.
   At the bus stop 100 yards from the gates, a knot of workers
began to talk freely with foreign reporters.
   ``They have to give people what they deserve,'' A beefy man in a
shiny tan jacket said of communist authorities.
   He punched the air angrily with his finger as he spoke: ``We are
working. Prices are going up. We have no money.''
   Others murmured agreement and nodded.
   It was Friday night and workers had occuped the plant for four
days, demanding pay raises, the restoration of union rights and
reinstatement of dismissed Solidarity activists.
   A worker on the edge of the group said he made $107 a month,
half of which he must spend on the maintenance and mortgage on his
home: ``We are working all the time, on Sundays too. And we can
hardly live.''
   Prices have gone up 42 percent so far this year as the result of
government reforms aimed at making the economy more market-oriented.
   ``We don't believe them anymore,'' a middle-aged man with a
quiet manner said of authorities. ``They keep promising (that
things will get better) and yet we can't earn in one day even
enough for two kilos (4 pounds) of herring.
   ``They share millions and we are near starvation.''
   The workers have been inside the plant for 16 hours at a stretch
during the strike, the nation's worst since martial law stifled the
Solidarity independent labor federation 6{ yearss ago. Strikers
spend their day at the plant sitting, talking, tinkering, but not
working.
   They said some workers have not joined the stoppage and toil
while their colleagues in a neighboring department sit idle.
   The strike committee says it represents half the plant's 32,000
workers, and from 12,000 to 14,000 workers are in the plant at any
one time.

<TEXT>
   As spring returns to this rugged
country, plants, bushes and trees that have evolved to live with
fire are sprouting among ruined woodlands charred by Oregon's worst
forest fire in 50 years.
   One of the patches of color dotting the shiny blacks and dull
browns of burned trees in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness is the pink
flower of the Kalmiopsis bush, which needs periodic fires to
survive.
   ``It lives in some pretty rough places,'' said Lee Webb, a
wildlife biologist for the Siskiyou National Forest. ``Maybe what
happens is it lives where the fire doesn't hit. You expect fire to
burn places it's been before.
   ``It grows in the harshest sites because it can't compete. As
things go on and sites become better, it loses ground to other
plants. When the fire comes through and it is growing in these
little sanctuaries, it has a competitive edge.''
   He and Tom Atzet, a U.S. Forest Service regional ecologist,
scrambled down a steep slope of crumbling rock recently to a dead
canyon of live oak marked with white flags. The clump of Kalmiopsis
that survived was sheltered by the seared leaves of the oak trees.
   In other parts of the wilderness, the forest is healing itself
as loggers and environmentalists fight over whether to salvage the
96,500 acres of burned timber and replant the land or leave the job
to Mother Nature.
   Atzet stopped to dig out a fawn lilly, also known as a trout
lilly, blooming where just months before fire seared the soil's
surface.
   ``The lillies are just loving it,'' Atzet said. ``They store all
their energy underground in this bulb. Whether there is a fire or
not during the summer, it doesn't care.
   ``We are finding that leachates from the ash left by the fire
stimulate these things to grow. That gives them a competitive
advantage (against plants knocked back by the fire). It's a war out
here for every bit of nitrogen and every bit of water.''
   Madrone and sugar pine on one slope had been killed by a
fast-moving wall of flame that roared down Silver Creek. But now
many of the plants show tiny green sprouts around the bases of
their trunks.
   Throughout the North Kalmiopsis Roadless Area of the Siskiyou
National Forest, these evergreen hardwoods valued as clean-burning
firewood are grouped in rings, evidence that fire has been a
frequent visitor. Each time the sprouts return after a fire, the
ring grows wider.
   Where the fire overran the remains of a cleared area near
Chinaman Hat, new Douglas fir seedlings already have been planted
for a new forest.
   Atzet stopped again to drill into the bulging ``cat face'' of a
sugar pine. The cat face is a ring of bulging bark that has grown
to heal a scar left by a previous fire. Because the healing bark is
loaded with pitch, it tends to burn more intensely each time fire
sweeps past, and the cat face grows.
   ``I've found trees here that are 200 years old that have burned
four or five times,'' Atzet said.
   By examining the older trees, Atzet has found that fire returns
to the Kalmiopsis an average of every 50 years.
   ``It could be 150 years or it could be 25, but the average is
50,'' said Atzet. ``If we look at our records, we find that there
was a fire in the Kalmiopsis area in the 1930s, so this one was
right on schedule.''
   He bored into a sugar pine that was blackened around the base
but retained a green canopy. He pulled out a core of damp wood and
examined the largely undamaged cambium layer beneath the bark,
which allows a tree to form new bark and wood.
   ``What fire?'' he exclaimed.

   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis is telling Ohio
supporters not to be lulled by polls giving him a safe lead, while
party rival Jesse Jackson is stepping up his criticism of the
Massachusetts governor.
   Vice President George Bush, meanwhile, told supporters on Friday
that he's ready to let Democrats have a taste of some of their own
medicine if they try to raise the ``sleaze factor'' against him.
   Bush, the certain Republican nominee, also challenged the two
Democrats to join him in supporting the death penalty for ``drug
kingpins.''
   Dukakis was campaigning today in Cincinnati and Cleveland before
traveling to next-door Indiana, where he planned events in
Indianapolis. Dukakis is expecting to add to his string of
victories when both states hold their primaries Tuesday.
   Jackson's attempt to chip away at the Dukakis lead will
intensify Sunday and Monday when he will air TV ads saying ``Mike
Dukakis wants to manage the damage'' left from the Reagan
administration, campaign manager Gerald Austin said. The ads say
Jackson ``wants to change the course of America.''
   Austin, who managed Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste's 1982 and 1986
campaigns, said Jackson is spending $400,000 on media in the battle
for Ohio's 159 delegates to the Democratic National Convention this
summer
   Jackson on Friday assailed Dukakis for not wanting to classify
South Africa as a terrorist state for allegedly supporting rebels
battling Mozambique. Dukakis has rejected Jackson's call to provide
arms to Mozambique's Marxist government to fight the rebels.
   Celeste appeared with Dukakis before a union audience in
Columbus but did not endorse him. Celeste planned to appear with
Jackson in Cleveland on Sunday.
   Celeste said he wanted ``to ensure an open, enthusiastic primary
in the state.''
   Dukakis told crowds across the state, ``I hope you won't pay
attention to these polls.'' He recalled his 1978 race for
re-election as governor of Massachusetts when he lost despite a
huge lead, as much as 50 points at one point in the polls.
   Polls in Ohio are giving Dukakis a 2-to-1 lead over Jackson.
With more than 1,250 delegates in the Associated Press total,
Dukakis enjoys a lead of roughly 400 over Jackson. He is also
beginning to win over committed delegates from the suspended
campaigns of Tennessee Sen. Al Gore and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon.
   Dukakis is trying to make a major issue in industrial Ohio of
President Reagan's vow to veto the trade bill passed by the Senate
because of the provision requiring companies to give 60 days notice
before closing plants. He said a similar law in Massachusetts had
``cushioned the blow'' and ``helped us to save thousands of jobs
and hundreds of companies.''
   Massachusetts state officials say, however, the plant closing
law has not ``saved'' workers' jobs but has helped some 24,000 find
new employment after plant closings.
   Bush was campaigning today in Ohio, including stops in Cleveland
and at an Ohio State University spring football scrimmage.
   Bush said Friday in interviews in Indianapolis he is not worried
about his campaign being hurt by current investigations into
Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Meese's business associates.
   He also said he did not think the ``sleaze'' issue hurts him.
   ``I think the Democrats are trying to make it that, but we will
have some fun, too, trying to look into what is going on in
Illinois or Massachusetts depending upon which one wins the
Democratic nomination,'' he said.
   At a rally in Indianapolis, Bush said: ``Let me throw this
challenge down. I favor the death penalty for narcotics kingpins.
Now will the Democrats join us on that or not?''

   Michael Dukakis is insisting ``it's not
all over'' and urging Ohio supporters to ignore polls and other
signs that he is advancing strongly toward the Democratic
presidential nomination.
   Dukakis, expecting to add to his string of victories in Ohio and
Indiana primaries on Tuesday, all but ignored his remaining party
rival Jesse Jackson while campaigning across Ohio on Friday.
Instead, he focused on criticizing the Reagan administration on
trade legislation and other issues.
   He was campaigning today in Cincinnati and Cleveland before
traveling to next-door Indiana, where he planned events in
Indianapolis.
   At every stop as he criss-crossed Ohio, Dukakis told crowds, ``I
hope you won't pay attention to these polls.'' He recalled his 1978
race for re-election as governor of Massachusetts when he lost
despite a huge lead, as much as 50 points at one point in the polls.
   ``What I am concerned about,'' Dukakis said, ``... is people
looking at polls and taking them seriously and assuming that it's
all over.
   ``It's not all over, and I know that better than anybody from
rather painful personal experience.''
   Dukakis, who holds a commanding lead in the delegate race and is
the undisputed front-runner, has come under sharpened criticism
from Jackson over the past two days.
   Dukakis turned aside questions about his rival's charge that he
would only ``manage'' President Reagan's ecomomic program, not
change it.
   ``I just don't talk about those things,'' Dukakis said. ``I have
a record. The White House would be very much surprised if they
learned all of a sudden Michael Dukakis was going to manage
Reaganomics _ they don't believe that for one minute.''
   The Massachusetts governor is seeking to make a major issue in
industrial Ohio of the president's vow to veto the trade bill
passed by the Senate because of the provision requiring companies
to give 60 days notice before closing plants. He said a similar law
in Massachusetts had ``cushioned the blow'' and ``helped us to save
thousands of jobs and hundreds of companies.''
   However, because the Massachusetts law requests _ but does not
require _ companies to provide workers with 90 days warning before
a plant closing, Dukakis administration officials in Boston have
been unable to offer evidence the notification provision has
accomplished its goal.
   Massachusetts state officials say the plant closing law has not
``saved'' workers' jobs but has helped some 24,000 find new
employment after plant closings.
   Ohio's Democratic Gov. Richard Celeste appeared with Dukakis
before a union audience in Columbus, but did not endorse him and
planned to appear with Jackson in Cleveland on Sunday.
   Celeste said he wanted ``to ensure an open, enthusiastic primary
in the state, in which Rev. Jackson knows he's as welcome as Gov.
Dukakis at every place, including the governor's office, and his
supporters know we expect them to be part of a unified effort in
the fall.''
   Despite his insistence the race is not over, Dukakis struck an
optimistic note as he urged a lunchtime crowd in Dayton to help
bring a large voter turnout. ``If we do, we're going to win in
Ohio, we're going to win in Indiana, we're going to win in West
Virginia and in California and in New Jersey, and win this
nomination,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rebels Drop Demand; 11 Arrested In Demonstrations</HEAD>

   Rebel leaders dropped a demand that
their fighters receive ammunition and weapons after moving into
cease-fire zones, removing a major obstacle in peace talks with the
government.
   Also Friday, the leftist Sandinista government's labor troubles
persisted and police used rubber truncheons to quell protests by
striking auto mechanics and construction workers, arresting 11
demonstrators.
   The decision by leaders of the rebels, known as Contras, not to
demand arms supplies after their fighters move into the seven
cease-fire zones removed a key barrier to achieving a lasting peace
under accords signed March 23.
   ``We have desisted from receiving replacements of weapons and
ammunition in the zones and we accept the concept of sovereignty
and indivisibility of national territory,'' top Contra leader
Adolfo Calero told a news conference.
   The Contras had also insisted that the cease-fire zones be
autonomous.
   Calero said, however, that the Contras rejected the government's
demand that more than $17 million in humanitarian aid to the
rebels, recently approved by the U.S. Congress, be channeled
through the International Red Cross.
   The aid was to be funneled to Nicaragua through the U.S. Agency
for International Development.
   Under the March 23 agreement signed in the southern border town
of Sapoa, only neutral parties may distribute the aid.
   The rebels have been supported by Washington since 1981, when
they mounted the insurgency that has claimed more than 26,000
lives. The Sapoa accords promise them a role in the political
process in a more democratic Nicaragua.
   Earlier Friday, the rebels turned down a government proposal to
extend by a month a 60-day cease-fire that began April 1. They said
the Sandinista offer showed ``a lack of good will to fulfill the
agreements.''
   In Washington, President Reagan said Friday he would continue to
apply economic sanctions against Nicaragua to counter the ``unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign
policy of the United States'' posed by the Sandinista regime.
   In a semi-annual report required by law, Reagan said trade
sanctions ``complement the diplomatic and other aspects of our
policy toward Nicaragua.''
   One of the two labor protests in Managua on Friday came outside
the General Workers Confederation, an umbrella group for
anti-Sandinista unions, where 38 construction workers and auto
mechanics went on a hunger strike Sunday.
   On Friday night, about 80 university students staged a march in
sympathy with about 1,500 workers from both industries who have
been on strike for higher wages since Feb. 25.
   The students passed near the union headquarters, chanting ``A
Free Fatherland!.'' Riot squads standing by did not interfere, but
the police cordoned off the building's entrance.
   A banner strung across the building said: ``We prefer to die of
hunger fighting with dignity than to die working as slaves.''
   Meanwhile, Jose Castillo Osejo, an opposition leader and
director of privately-owned Radio Corporation, claimed Interior
Minister Tomas Borge summoned him to his office, berated the radio
for its reporting of the demonstrations and punched him in the
mouth.
   Castillo, a leader of a private human rights group and the
opposition Conservative Party, said Borge later apologized.

   Officials of South Africa and Angola will meet
for the first time to discuss a peace settlement that will include
the possible withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola when they join
delegates from the United States and Cuba in London next week.
   The delegations also will confer on other regional issues,
including the status of a parallel effort to bring about
independence and black majority rule in Namibia or Southwest
Africa, which is under South African administration, the State
Department said Friday.
   The American delegation to the May 3-4 talks will be headed by
Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, State Department
spokesman Charles Redman said. Cuban officials will join the talks
as part of the Angolan delegation.
   South African and Angolan forces have been intermittently
involved militarily since the Marxist government assumed power in
Maputo in 1975.
   South Africa sent troops into Angola last summer in support of
UNITA, Angola's U.S.-backed rebel movement. South African officials
have said the number of troops has been sharply reduced from a peak
of 3,000.
   The United States has given high priority to reaching an
agreement that would lead to the withdrawal of the estimated 40,000
Cuban troops in Angola, a close ally of the Soviet Union.
   U.S. officials were encouraged last January when Angola and Cuba
agreed for the first time to the principle of a total Cuban
withdrawal from Angola. There has been no agreement, however, on a
timetable.
   Angola's main interests are an end to American assistance to the
rebel movement in Angola and to the withdrawal of South African
forces in Angola.
   A delegation from the Organization of African Unity met with
Crocker two weeks ago and said the United States should end all aid
to the Angolan rebels as a means of helping the peace process but
officials said Crocker turned down the request.

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson says he intends to ``raise the
level'' of the campaign debate as he takes on Democratic
presidential rival Michael Dukakis over fiscal and foreign policy.
   In an uphill bid to close in on Dukakis' widening delegate lead,
Jackson is painting the Massachusetts governor as a candidate who
has not shown a strong willingness to undo President Reagan's
legacy.
   Campaigning under Cleveland's cold rainy skies for votes in
Tuesday's Ohio primary, Jackson hit Dukakis on two issues _
southern Africa and Reaganomics.
   He said Dukakis lacks understanding about southern Africa,
particlarly in Mozambique where Jackson said Dukakis is to the
right of President Reagan.
   Jackson also vowed Friday to intensify his quest for the
nomination after a string of primary losses to Dukakis.
   He told a labor rally in Cleveland: ``I'm not behind. I'm so far
in front of where I started. We've come too far from where we
started and I don't feel no way tired. We're going all the way.''
   It was clear Jackson's strategy is to paint sharp distinctions
between himself and Dukakis, criticizing his rival as lacking in
clear policy positions.
   He said Dukakis would not give military aid to Mozambique in the
face of South-Africa backed rebel brutality against civilians. That
is someting even Reagan favors, Jackson said.
   Jackson told reporters traveling on his campaign bus that
Dukakis does not understand the policy options in Africa, but that
he was not questioning the governor's motivation.
   ``His intention I'm convinced would be to end apartheid,''
Jackson said. ``But we need a plan and a commitment to end
apartheid ... It is clear when he takes a position to the right of
Reagan that is bad judgment ... He does not understand the options
in southern Africa.
   ``It's my intention to raise the general level of the foreign
policy debate.''
   Also on Friday, Jackson campaign manager Gerald Austin said the
campaign will unveil a new television commercial Sunday and Monday.
   He said the campaign will spend $400,000 on media in Ohio.
   The ad, consisting of a series of still shots, will have a
voice-over saying that Vice President George Bush wants to stay the
course, ``Mike Dukakis wants to manage the damage'' and ``Jackson
wants to change the course of America.''

<HEAD>Christian Democrats Choose Controversial Presidential Candidate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rowdy and contentious
convention, the governing Christian Democratic Party chose wealthy
businessman Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes as its candidate in next
year's presidential elections.
   The choice Friday set off a controversy that could split the
party.
   Rey Prendes, a former Cabinet minister, was chosen by
acclamation as the sole entry in the convention marked by insults,
boos, whistles and catcalls.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, his bitter rival and a former foreign
minister, boycotted the convention and so did President Jose
Napoleon Duarte.
   The president, the party's honorary chairman, had urged both
contenders to step aside in favor of a ``unity candidate.''
   The two rivals, as well as the convention, ignored a dramatic
appeal earlier in the week to put aside their differences and back
Abraham Gonzalez, a party veteran, in order to maintain unity
within the centrist organization.
   Duarte warned that a rift in Christian Democratic ranks will
weaken the party and leave the field wide open to its chief rival,
the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, which has already won
control of the National Legislature and a majority of mayorships in
mid-term elections March 20.
   By law, Duarte could not run for a second five-year term. He won
the presidency in the midst of a leftist civil war against the
U.S.-supported conservative government that began in 1980 and
continues.
   Months ago, Rey Prendes wrested control of the party machinery
from the Duarte and Chavez Mena factions, so Chavez Mena was at big
disadvantage throughout the race.
   Aquilino Duarte, a nephew of the president and member of the
party's 10-member directorate, predicted the choice ``is going to
shatter'' the party.
   Also addressing the delegates before the acclamation vote,
Roberto Vieira, another directorate member, warned amid boos: ``If
we make this decision and the party splits, the people will not
have a democratic option in the presidential election.''
   Rey Prendes expressed hope there will be no split.
   ``I'm sure that once tempers cool, we'll all be together again
in the struggle. Let the anger end today,'' he said in an
acceptance speech.
   ``My arms are open. There is no need to exclude anyone,'' he
said in what was taken as a reference to Chavez Mena.
   Rey Prendes is a former presidential press spokesman, a
Cabinet-level job, a former mayor of San Salvador and a member of
the directorate. He and Chavez Mena helped found the party in 1960.

   Vice President George Bush says that if the
Democrats want to talk about sleaze, he is prepared to ``have some
fun'' with corruption in their own backyards.
   Bush was campaigning today in Ohio, planning stops in Cleveland
and at an Ohio State University spring football scrimmage.
   Bush, who has already amassed enough delegates to capture the
Republican nomination, spent Friday in Indiana, which, like Ohio
and the District of Columbia, holds its primary Tuesday.
   Before more than 4,000 supporters who packed the Indiana
Convention Center in Indianapolis Friday evening, Bush promised to
``bring new people to Washington ... people who come there to serve
and not to profit.''
   But in interviews with Indianapolis reporters, Bush said he is
not worried about his campaign being hurt by current investigations
into Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Meese's business
associates.
   ``I hear (the Democrats) talking about it. But there is plenty
of evidence to kind of go into a guilt-by-association mode where we
can find in Massachusetts politics or campaign staff or things of
that nature,'' said Bush in a thinly veiled reference to Democratic
presidential front-runner Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``I hope we don't have to do it,'' he said.
   Asked by television reporters if the ``sleaze'' issue hurts him,
Bush replied, ``I don't think so. I don't think anyone has ever
accused me of any conflict of interest. I think the Democrats are
trying to make it that.''
   But depending on whether Dukakis or Jesse Jackson wins the
Democratic nomination, ``We will have some fun, too, trying to look
into what is going on in Illinois or Massachusetts,'' Bush said.
   He added, ``We've got some cannon fodder, if you want to get
into that.
   At the big convention center rally Bush also responded to
Dukakis' criticism of his backing a threatened veto by President
Reagan of the trade bill passed this week in Congress.
   ``We're not talking about pink slips. We're not talking about
closing factories. We're talking about opening factories until
every man and woman that wants a job has a job.''
   ``It's going to be the classic confrontation between one who
respects the federalist approach and one who wants to see a return
to the misery days,'' said Bush, clearly spoiling for the general
election fight during a campaign stop in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
   ``I didn't like the primary part. I didn't like going out
nitpicking, trying to find minutiae differences with my fellow
Republicans,'' he added.
   At a fund-raising breakfast in Fort Wayne, Bush said Dukakis
waffled on whether to support President Reagan's retaliatory strike
against Iran in the Persian Gulf, and he accused both Dukakis and
Jackson of being soft on penalties for drug-pushers.
   ``Let me throw this challenge down'' to Dukakis and Jackson,
Bush said. ``I favor the death penalty for narcotics kingpins. Now
will the Democrats join us on that or not?''
   He defended Reagan admistration efforts to cut off the supply of
drugs, but told reporters, ``I'm taking a look now at changing the
whole structure of how the government is set up'' to wage the drug
fight.
   Asked why President Reagan has not yet endorsed him, Bush said,
``I'm sure he has in his mind as long as there is any vestige of
the primary, I expect he won't. ... I think he will give me full,
unqualified support at the appropriate time.''
   The Bush campaign has a major rally scheduled in Washington for
Tuesday, and there have been reports Reagan may announce his
support for Bush there. Bush aides said Friday that was not yet
certain.

   Here is the text of the letter from the Senate
Select Committee on Ethics to Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., on
its investigation of his public comments on intelligence matters:
   Dear Senator Durenberger:
   The Select Committee has received and investigated allegations
that certain of your public statements violated Senate Resolution
400.
   Senate Resolution 400 prohibits the disclosure of classified
intelligence information which has been provided to the Select
Committee on Intelligence, and imposes a duty upon each senator to
exercise special care when discussing intelligence matters. As the
immediate former chairman of the Intelligence Committee you are
under a particular and substantial obligation to comply with the
letter and spirit of Senate Resolution 400.
   The Ethics Committee has determined that your statements gave
the appearance that you were disclosing sensitive national security
information and such appearance jeopardized the mutual confidence
which must exist between the Congress and the intelligence
community.
   Because the committee has concluded that your actions were not
intentional, deliberate, nor attended with gross negligence, and
because of the particular facts of this case, we will not recommend
that the Senate take institutional action against you. However, the
committee wants to make it clear that it does not condone your
actions.''
   (Signed) Sen. Howell Heflin, chairman, Sen. Warren B. Rudman,
vice chairman, and Sens. David Pryor, Terry Sanford, Jesse Helms
and Nancy Kassebaum.

   Here is the text of the statement released
Friday by Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announcing a change
in U.S. policy regarding the protection of commercial ships in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``The president has decided to provide assistance under certain
circumstances to ships in distress in the Persian Gulf and Strait
of Hormuz in keeping with longstanding, time-honored Navy and
maritime tradition.
   ``Such aid will be provided to friendly, innocent neutral
vessels flying a non-belligerent flag, outside declared
war-exclusion zones, that are not carrying contraband or resisting
legitimate visit and search by a Persian Gulf belligerent.
   ``Following a request from the vessel under attack, assistance
will be rendered by a U.S. warship or aircraft if this unit is in
the vicinity and its mission permits rendering such assistance.
With this assistance, we anticipate no increase in our current
force levels.
   ``We are not the policemen of the gulf, nor do we wish to be.
   ``For over 200 years, U.S. policy has been to help protect
freedom of navigation in international waters. This (new)
assistance is a logical and humanitarian outgrowth of recent events
in the gulf which further strengthens our adherence to this
principle.
   ``We cannot stand by and watch innocent people be killed or
maimed by malicious, lawless actions when we have the means to
assist, and perhaps prevent them.
   ``We do not intend to describe our specific rules of engagement
or the methods we plan to use in rendering this assistance. We see
no reason to give advantage to those who wish us ill.
   ``With regard to mines, I have consulted with our allies who
were attending the Nuclear Planning Group meeting in Brussels this
week. We all agreed that we should provide each other mutual
support and cooperation in the interest of keeping the
international waterways free from this threat.
   ``Finally, this policy should not be construed as a tilt in
either direction in the war.
   ``Our policy has been and will continue to be one of strict
neutrality. We, along with the rest of the civilized international
community, want this war to end.
   ``In this respect, we strongly support implementation of UN
Security Council Resolution 598 and passage of a second resolution
imposing an arms embargo on that belligerent that does not accept
598 as a means to reach a diplomatic settlement of this tragic war.
   ``We also want to see an end to the wanton waste of human life
that has characterized this war. In that regard, we especially
deplore the use of chemical warfare by either belligerent, which
has become one of the most regrettable developments in this
protracted conflict.
   ``This policy will go into effect once we have informed those
free world, non-belligerent countries that maintain shipping
interests in the gulf.''

<HEAD>Underground Leaders Call on Youths To Maintain Uprising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOCELYN NOVECK</BYLINE>

   Underground Palestinian leaders urged Arab
youths to keep up the 5-month-old uprising in the occupied Gaza
Strip and the West Bank and stepped up threats against
Israeli-appointed mayors in the territories.
   ``Boys and girls of Palestine, we need more attacking forces,
more giving to Palestine,'' said the latest underground leaflet,
released Friday. ``Every strike at the body of our enemy will bring
the day of victory nearer.''
   The leaflet said ``the blood of our martyrs must not be spilled
for nothing.''
   It was released on one of the quietest Moslem Sabbaths in
months. No injuries were reported despite calls for protests to
honor the 175 Palestinians killed in the anti-occupation violence
since it began Dec. 8.
   Israeli officials, encouraged by the relative quiet this past
week, have claimed the ``intefadah'' _ Arabic for ``uprising'' _
was fading.
   The latest leaflet, signed as usual by the ``United Leadership
of the Uprising,'' called for more general strikes and ``days of
confrontation with occupation forces.''
   It also named four Israeli-appointed mayors who have refused the
underground's demands to resign, urging ``our masses to strike the
severest blows against those ... who are violating our wills and
orders.''
   The leaflet singled out the mayors of the West Bank towns of
Hebron, Ramallah, El Bireh and Jericho.
   Scattered protests were reported following Moslem noon prayers
Friday.
   In Gaza City, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse several dozen
youths who hurled stones after prayers, Arab reports said. Troops
also fired rubber bullets at worshipers in the nearby Jabaliya
refugee camp, the reports said.
   In Jerusalem Friday, hundreds of Moslem worshipers waved
outlawed Palestinian flags on the sacred Temple Mount chanting:
``Jews leave! The prophet Mohammed's army is coming!''
   The protesters chanted praise for Khalil Wazir, the PLO military
leader who was gunned down April 16 in Tunis. Israeli sources have
confirmed that Israeli commandos were responsible, but the
government has denied comment.
   In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops and their Lebanese militia
allies raided two villages on Friday, questioning residents about
two guerrilla attacks in Israel this week.
   The army said two militiamen from the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army were killed when their vehicle ran over a land mine on
a side road in Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' north of
the border.
   On Tuesday, two Israeli soldiers and three Palestinian
guerrillas were killed in a clash after the Arabs crossed into
northern Israel. In a second incursion Wednesday, two guerrillas
were killed.
   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of the army's northern command, pointed a
finger Friday at Syria for helping the guerrillas.
   ``Without a doubt, these recent operations came from an area
under Syrian influence,'' Peled told Israel television.
   Israel radio said troops entered the villages of Kfar Hamam and
Rachaiya El Foukhar, four and six miles north of the Israeli
border, to question residents about the attacks. Security sources
in Lebanon said they were told five Lebanese had been detained. The
army declined comment on the report.
   Military officials have linked the recent guerrilla raids to the
uprising in the occupied lands, which Israel seized in the 1967
Middle East war.

   A structural failure, not a bomb, likely
caused the ``big bang'' that ripped open an Aloha Airlines jet,
injuring 61 people and apparently sucking a flight attendant from
the cabin to her death, a federal official said Friday.
   The Boeing 737, which was cruising at 24,000 feet on an island
hop from Hilo to Honolulu, made a safe emergency landing at Kahului
airport Thursday, after flying about 15 minutes with 20 feet of its
upper fuselage _ just behind the front passenger door _ torn away
to the floor. Witnesses said one engine was on fire.
   ``There was a big bang when it happened and everybody looked up
and we were looking at blue sky,'' said passenger Bill Fink of
Honolulu.
   At a news conference late Friday night, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board said investigators believed the cause
of the accident was a structural problem with the aging jet.
   ``I think it's fair to say the focus of the investigation is on
the structure itself, the hole itself, and what if any causes might
have been to create hull fractures or hull fatigue,'' said NTSB
member Joseph T. Nall.
   The possibility of a bomb having exploded aboard the aircraft
has been ruled out, said one source in Washington, speaking on
condition of anonymity. However, Nall said, ``We can't rule
anything in or anything out.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration had ordered a close
inspection of the upper skin of older model Boeing 737s _ including
the Aloha jet _ in October because of cracks near where sections of
sheet metal overlap and had warned such cracks could cause rapid
cabin decompression, according to FAA officials in Washington.
   ``We are in full compliance with the October directive,''
Stephanie Ackerman, an Aloha Airlines spokeswoman, said Friday. She
said the inspections have been done as outlined by the FAA and
turned up nothing unusual.
   FAA records also showed that the Aloha plane had extensive
repair work done to mend cracks and corroded metal twice in 1983,
but most of that work involved problems with the lower half of the
plane, which seemed not to be involved in Thursday's incident.
   A source close to the accident probe in Washington said
investigators are focusing on whether a structural failure such as
metal fatigue or corrosion might have caused the airplane's skin to
tear, causing rapid decompression.
   One theory is that strong winds may then have ripped away the
huge upper section of the fuselage from just behind the front door
to within a few feet of the wing, sources said.
   Investigators also believe that it is unlikely that an engine
failure played a significant part in the plane tearing apart, a
source said.
   Meanwhile,a Coast Guard cutter and helicopter searched the
Pacific Ocean south and southeast of Maui for ``anything associated
with the explosion of Flight 243,'' according to spokesman Brad
Nelson.
   Searchers had been unable to locate flight attendant Clarabelle
B. Lansing of Honolulu, a 37-year veteran with the airline, or any
debris from the plane, Nelson said.
   Aloha officials said they believe Lansing was sucked out of the
plane when it rapidly decompressed after the explosion.
   Passengers held onto another flight attendant so she would not
be sucked out of the open plane, according to passenger Dan Dennin,
a Honolulu salesman.
   Seven of the injured remained at Maui Memorial Hospital on
Friday. One was in critical condition and one in guarded condtion.
   George Harvey, Federal Aviation Administration area coordinator
for Honolulu, said some National Transportation Safety Board
investigators arrived at Kahului Airport on Thursday and would hold
a news conference Friday.
   Harvey said he could not confirm whether investigators suspected
a structural failure caused the fuselage to tear away from the
airplane.
   ``It stands to reason that they're checking everything _
structure failure, explosive devices,'' Harvey said.
   The plane was carrying 89 passengers, five crew members and an
air traffic controller when the explosion occurred around 1:45 p.m.
HST. The plane, traveling about 345 miles per hour, was 25 miles
southeast of Maui.
   ``There was a blast ... a whoosh, like someone popped a bag ...
and the air rushed out immediately,'' said Dennin. ``A third of the
roof was gone. ... I looked up and saw blue sky.
   ``Everybody screamed,'' he said. ``However, it was very brief _
the panic. ... The rest of the plane was intact. ... I think that
people realized the plane was still flying and they quickly went
about the business of doing whatever they could do to save their
lives.''
   Passenger Alice Godwin of Boulder City, Nev., said she put on a
life jacket and put her head between her knees. ``I sang all the
hymns I knew,'' she said. ``That kept me busy.''
   Mark Eberly, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he dropped
to his knees in shock as he watched the plane land with one of its
engines smoking and the section of fuselage missing. ``I saw hair
flying in the wind and arms dangling,'' he said.
   Kevin Hildebrant, a tour van driver who helped take the injured
to the hospital, said he was struck by the silence of the
passengers after the plane landed.
   ``I guess everyone was so shocked out, everyone was silent,''
Hildebrant said. ``They were very calm, I guess, to compensate for
what they went through.''
   Passengers praised the pilot, Capt. Robert L. Schornstheimer, a
12-year veteran of the airline, for a remarkable job in making a
safe landing.
   ``He brought that plane down so smoothly,'' said passenger John
Lopez, 40, of Hilo. ``It was just like riding in a Cadillac.''
   A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the main subsidiary
of the Boeing Co., said there were no fuel lines or other potential
sources for an explosion in the front of the airplane.
   ``To have it just explode in the air is just unheard of,'' said
Boeing spokesman Tom Cole.
   He also said that in the unlikely chance that a turbine blade
tore loose from the engine and ripped into the fuselage, it would
not have hit forward of the wing.
   Aloha President A. Maurice Myers said at a news conference in
Honolulu that nothing is stored in the area where the fuselage was
ripped apart.
   The Boeing 737 was delivered to Aloha in 1969 and apparently has
been in service ever since, according to Cole.
   The 737 is one of the oldest of the 737-200 series planes in
service, he said. The first of the series was put into commercial
service in February 1968 at United Airlines, he said.
   The FAA's directive for inspection of the early-model Boeing
737s was issued last year because cracks were discovered during
routine inspections near fasteners that join sections of sheet
metal in three aircraft. The same inspections also found fuselage
tear strips coming loose on some of the planes because the
lamination was no longer holding.
   The repair work needed on the Aloha jet included fixing in 1983
and several other times since then cracks and corrosion on the
wings, according to FAA records. A section of the right wing was
replaced last year when cracks were found in the wing spar.

<HEAD>Chemist, Investigator of Chernobyl Nuclear Accident Dies at 51</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valery A. Legasov, a physical chemist who led the
commission the investigated the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, has
died at the age of 51, the official Soviet news agency Tass
announced.
   Neither Tass nor the evening television news broadcast Vremya on
Friday gave the cause or place of death.
   Tass said Legasov died Wednesday, a day after the second
anniversary of the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the
nuclear power plant in the Soviet Ukraine in which at least 31
people were killed.
   It was not known if Legasov was exposed to dangerous levels of
radiation while investigating the disaster, the world's worst
nuclear power accident.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top Communist Party
officials and scientists signed the obituary carried by Tass.
   Legasov's name had been absent from the dozens of Soviet media
reports on Tuesday's anniversary of the accident at the nuclear
facility 80 miles north of Kiev.
   Legasov's foreign colleagues in nuclear power research had
praised his openness in discussing the causes and effects of the
Chernobyl accident, in contrast to initial Soviet delay in
releasing information about it.
   The accident spread radioactivity worldwide.
   Legasov was first deputy director of the I.V. Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy and a member of the Presidium of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences. The official obituary praised his work
with inert gases and in the use of nuclear reactors to generate
electricity.
   Legasov headed Soviet delegations to meetings on the Chernobyl
disaster of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency.
   In August 1986, he made a five-hour presentation of the Soviet
investigators' report on Chernobyl to the agency. The report blamed
the accident on human error rather than faulty equipment.
   Tass said Legasov made a ``significant contribution in the
working out and realization of immediate measures aimed at
liquidating the consequences of the accident.''

<HEAD>Court Asked To Decide on Lawsuits Against Makers of Cheap Handguns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has asked for the view
of a District of Columbia court on whether makers of handguns like
the one used to shoot President Reagan can be sued for deaths and
injuries when those guns are used.
   The legal issue was referred Friday to the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals in a case involving Thomas K. Delahanty, a former
District of Columbia policeman, one of three people wounded by
presidential assailant John W. Hinckley Jr. in the 1981 shooting.
Delahanty had tried to sue the gun manufacturer.
   The action by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington
raises the possibility that Delahanty and former White House press
Secretary James Brady may revive lawsuits against Roehm
Gesellschaft, the West German manufacturer of the .22-caliber
pistol used by Hinckley.
   The federal court sought the D.C. court's view because federal
courts must apply the laws of the states in which they are located
to civil suits.
   The court noted that Maryland law should be consulted since the
District of Columbia was carved out of Maryland when the nation's
capital was formed.
   A 1985 ruling by Maryland's highest court made gun makers and
sellers liable for injuries and death caused by the criminal use of
so-called Saturday Night Specials.
   The federal court's requst _ an advisory opinion _ is merely a
suggestion and does not require a ruling by the D.C. court.
   Richard Gardiner, assistant general counsel of the National
Rifle Association, said of Friday's advisory opinion, ``It's
obviously disappointing that this court didn't simply say this
theory is so outlandish that we're not going to pay any attention
to it.''
   The advisory opinion came a year after the same appellate court
upheld the dismissal of Brady's suit against Roehm and its U.S.
subsidiary, R.G. Industries.
   In that ruling, the court held Brady did not raise a valid
negligence claim because gun manufacturers were not obligated ``to
prevent criminals from using their products.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee says states seeking the
super collider atom smasher will not have to put up at least $500
million in cash or services to land the eagerly pursued research
installation.
   The Space, Science and Technology Committee on Friday, in a
20-11 vote, rejected the minimum-funds amendment offered by Rep.
Ron Packard, R-Calif., for the $4.4 billion superconducting super
collider.
   Committee members also voted 16-14 against an alternative that
would have required the secretary of energy to report to the
committee in six months his recommendations for what the winning
state should pay.
   The amendments were offered to the $3.1 billion Energy
Department research authorization bill.
   As it stands, the bill would authorize $1.6 billion over the
next three years for the collider, of which $148 million would be
for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 _ but with no construction
funds until Oct. 1, 1989.
   Several amendments to the bill remain to be considered,
including measures that would sharply reduce the super collider
authorization or eliminate it altogether, and to make a 25 percent
foreign contribution a requirement for proceeding with the giant
atom smasher.

<HEAD>Counter-Terrorism Official Predicts Rise in Palestinian Terror</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top U.S. counter-terrorism expert says there
is likely to be a surge in Palestinian terrorism as a result of the
uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and the killing of a
Palestinian guerrilla chieftain.
   Ambassador L. Paul Bremer said Friday that Libya continues to
plan international terrorist attacks, but is looking for such
surrogates as the Japanese Red Army ``to do its dirty work.''
   In an interview, Bremer said, ``There is a possibility of a
measurable increase of Palestinian terrorism'' in the coming months
because of the five-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the killing of
Khalil Wazir, the second-in-command of the Palestine Liberation
Organization by Israeli agents.
   The rapprochement between PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Syrian
President Hafez Assad following the assassination of Wazir, also
known as Abu Jihad, may contribute to a terror campaign, although
it is too soon to assess the impact of the thaw, he said.
   The rapprochement between PLO chief Yasser Arafat and Syrian

   Bremer also said that Abu Nidal, who heads a Palestinian faction
which broke away from the Arafat's Fatah branch of the PLO
continues to plan terror attacks from his headquarters in Libya
where he maintains 300 to 400 operatives.

   The Justice Department says more than 1,000
Mariel Cuban detainess have been released into halfway houses or
family sponsors in communities since prison disturbances conducted
by them last fall.
   Delays in placing the detainees in halfway houses was one of the
issues n as triggering last year's uprisings at federal prisons in
Atlanta and Oakdale, La. Federal officials had said they were
having trouble finding space in the halfway houses for the
detainees.
   From last June until the time the prison riots erupted in
November, the Immigration and Naturalization Service had released
only 106 Cuban inmates to halfway houses or to family sponsors. A
total of 1,047 have been placed since the disturbances.
   INS has approved 2,224 Cuban detainees for release since last
June, of whom 1,337 have been approved since the riots.
   Parole has been denied to 1,193 Mariel Cubans and 845 of the
denials have been decided since the uprisings.

<HEAD>Deejay Goes Home After Baltimore Posts Its First Season Victory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio disc jockey Bob Rivers thought the idea
of spending a day or on the air two waiting for the hapless
Baltimore Orioles to win sounded like a challenge.
   Ten days, or to be more exact, 258{ hours later, Rivers was
tired and a bit haggard, but delighted to be going home after the
Orioles defeated the Chicago White Sox 9-0 to break an record
21-game losing streak.
   ``This is a Chicago blowout,'' Rivers said Friday night on his
show at station WIYY-FM as the game neared its conclusion. ``I'm
extremely happy and happening. I'm going home tonight.''
   Throughout the city of Baltimore Friday, fans celebrated around
television sets or let loose on the streets, where they set off
fire works, although police reported no problems.
   ``It has been outrageous. People have been going nuts,'' said
Mike Coster, a bartender at Balls, a sports bar. ``What a win. It's
almost like the '83 World Series here.'' The Orioles, once known as
a powerhouse team, won that series.
   Rivers, 31, who had promised to stay on the air until the
Orioles triumphed, popped open a bottle of champagne and drank from
a plastic Orioles beer cup, shouting, ``Ain't the beer cold?''
   The morning deejay's song lineup reflected his new mood. His
first was ``I'm Free,'' by The Who. Then came two songs by the rock
group Queen _ ``We Will Rock You,'' and ``We Are The Champions,''
marking an upbeat change from the Rolling Stones lyric ``You Can't
Always Get What You Want,'' that he played during the darker hours
as the Orioles rolled up loss after loss to set an American League
record.
   Rivers helped rally Baltimore fans and through a blitz of
national publicity got fans from other cities supporting the home
team. His vigil _ broken by occasional naps on a cot in a corner
office dubbed the ``Rivers Hilton'' _ was celebrated on national
television, talk shows and magazines.
   WBAL-TV sportscaster Vernon Glenn marked his liberation as well.
Glenn took off the shiny black and orange Orioles baseball jacket
he'd worn for more than a week after vowing to keep it on until the
O's posted a victory.
   Downtown Baltimore swelled with fans anxious to see the end of
the losing streak, which had gained national attention and brought
ridicule to the team.
   ``We were psyched. I knew they were going to win because
everybody wanted them to lose to break the record. Some people were
disappointed, but I'm still very happy. We're no longer losers,''
said Peter Milligan, a Baltimore stockbroker and lifelong Orioles
fan.
   The losing streak apparently has done little to weaken the
attachment the city of Baltimore has for its Orioles.
   A Fantastic Fans Night has been scheduled for Monday at Memorial
Stadium to honor the Orioles in their first home game in two weeks.
More than 44,000 tickets have been sold for the game with the Texas
Rangers, which features prize giveaways and musical entertainment.
   ``We'll all be there Monday night,'' Milligan said. ``Every
single person in this bar will be there. I guarantee it.''

   The Baltimore Orioles trounced the Chicago White
Sox 9-0 fpr their first win of the 3{-week-old season, snapping
their record-breaking losing streak at 21 games.
   The Orioles did it in style Friday night, allowing only four
hits and letting only one runner get past first base.
   Three cases of champagne were on ice and waiting for the Orioles
in their clubhouse afterward, the reward for the worst start in
major league history. The season opened April 4.
   Baltimore established the longest losing streak in American
League history with Thursday's defeat in Minnesota. They stopped
short of the major league mark of 23 consecutive losses by the
Philadelphia Phillies in 1961.
   The old record for the worst start in major league history was
held by both the 1904 Washington Senators and the 1920 Detroit
Tigers, who lost their first 13 games.
   A crowd of 14,059 sat quietly in 56-degree temperature as
Baltimore stopped its march of misery.

<HEAD>Year After Applying, Turkey EEC Membership Still Doubtful</HEAD>

   More than a year after Turkey asked to
join the European Economic Community, its membership prospects are
distant, frustrated by its rivalry with Greece.
   Talks collapsed this week after a Greek-inspired quarrel over
the presence of 29,000 Turkish troops in Cyprus.
   Relations between Greece and Turkey, two NATO allies that almost
went to war last year over rights to explore for minerals in the
Aegean Sea, are so poor that one diplomat of the Western alliance
told a reporter at its Brussels headquarters: ``Don't ask me about
Greece and Turkey in this building.''
   On Monday, a meeting in Luxembourg of EEC and Turkish officials
was canceled at the last minute following the fight inspired by
Greece, an EEC member since 1981.
   The bid to revive ties with Turkey ended in ``vituperative
exchanges'' between Greek and Turkish officials at dinner, one
source said.
   A session afterwards with foreign ministers was abruptly
canceled.
   ``I don't think any one of us expected this to happen,'' said
Foreign Minister Jacques Poos of Luxembourg.
   ``It was not a failure,'' said Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher of West Germany. The meeting simply ``did not take place.''
   Mesud Yilmaz, the Turkish foreign minister, refused to accept
the EEC view, contained in a statement, that the presence of
Turkish troops in northern Cyprus ``affects the relations'' between
it and Turkey.
   Yilmaz said the Turkish troops on Cyprus are none of the EEC's
business. Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 to protect the Turkish
Cypriot minority after a pro-Athens coup there.
   But Cyprus, like Turkey, has an association accord with the EEC
and also aspires to join the Common Market someday. The accord
gives Turkey trade privileges, development aid and a forum to
discuss EEC membership.
   The accord was suspended after a 1980 military coup in Turkey,
freezing an $748 million aid deal.
   The cancellation of Monday's meeting was embarrassing for West
Germany, Turkey's staunchest EEC ally.
   It has had good relations with Turkey for more than 100 years.
In the 1930s, many thousands of Germans fled their country's Nazi
regime to find exile in Turkey.
   The collapse of the EEC-Turkey talks was all the more surprising
as it followed recent meetings between Andreas Papandreou and
Turgut Ozal, the Greek and Turkish prime ministers, who agreed to
step up cooperation.
   It was hoped a new meeting on the issue can be held before June
30. On that day, West Germany hands over the EEC's rotating
presidency to Greece for six months dimming hopes for progress even
further.
   Turkey is eager to join the EEC. It prides itself in having a
rapid economic growth and liberal economic policies and sees itself
as a bridge between Europe and the volatile Middle East.

   Queen Elizabeth II today opened World
Expo '88, one of the highlights of yearlong celebrations to mark
200 years since Europeans settled in Australia.
   The queen told the invitation-only audience of 10,000 of the
long connection between the throne and Queensland, Australia's

   ``I am told you like to call your state the Sunshine State,''
she said. ``But I prefer to think of it by its original name _

   The $460 million Expo '88, with its theme of ``Leisure In The
Age Of Technology,'' has attracted exhibits from 36 countries. It
will be open until Oct. 30 and is expected to attract 7.8 million
visitors.
   The last World Expo staged in Australia was 100 years ago.

   A flight attendant was serving drinks to
a passenger and as ``their hands just touched'' she disappeared in
an explosion that ripped open the jetliner 24,000 feet above the
Pacific Ocean, a passenger said.
   Coast Guard searchers Friday failed to find any trace of
Clarabelle Lansing, 57, who had worked 37 years for Aloha Airlines.
   ``She was just handing my wife a drink,'' William Flanigan said.
``She had stopped and told us this was the last call. We were going
to be descending.
   ``And then, whoosh! She was gone. Their hands just touched when
it happened.''
   Sixty-one people were injured Thursday in the accident aboard
Flight 243. Federal investigators said they were focusing on
possible structural failure in the 19-year-old plane.
   Passengers praised Capt. Robert Schornstheimer, 42, who flew the
badly crippled plane for about 15 minutes before making an
emergency landing on Maui. After leaving the plane, many of those
who were uninjured sought out the pilot and shook his hand.
   ``It's tremendous how he controlled the plane,'' passenger
Ignazio Marinello said. ``The wind was so fantastic; without him
we'd never be alive.''
   ``I'm so amazed the pilot of the airplane did land it,'' said
James Toyooka, who said his three days of research for a stock
brokerage company went flying out the plane.
   ``I couldn't believe it _ that people are still alive,'' he said.
   Passengers said that even though the plane was rocking as it
headed toward the Maui airport, the landing was smooth.
   ``It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said John Lopez of
Hilo.
   The pilot's father, also named Robert Schornstheimer, said in an
interview from his Marietta, Ohio, home that his son didn't seem
unsettled when he spoke with him by telephone Thursday night after
the accident.
   ``When we talked to him he was still feeling pretty calm,'' he
said. ``He said you're calm about it when you're doing it, but
afterwards you start thinking about it.''
   ``He says it was just something else _ all of a sudden there was
this noise, and the plane's flying funny and there's a big drag on
it, so he immediately decided to change the flight plan to land at
the Maui airport, which was closest, and he was able to get it in
and land it,'' Schornstheimer said.
   In spite of the passengers' praise, Schornstheimer said his
son's actions were all in a day's work.
   ``He's pretty calm under pressure,'' he said. ``He said he was
calm and did what needed to be done, just like any other pilot
would have. They were talking about it on TV like (he was a hero),
but he said he just did what any other pilot would have done in the
same circumstance. But of course, he's skillful enough and trained
well enough to do it.''
   Passengers also praised other crew members.
   ``Make sure you tell them about the stewardesses,'' one
passenger told a reporter while being wheeled into Maui Memorial
Hospitl for treatment.
   One flight attendant crawled along the aisle, calming passengers
and trying to help the passengers put on their life vests, said
entertainer Robert Lopaka Brown, who was returning from his
honeymoon.
   ``Everyone went to work to better their chances of surviving a
crash,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kunstler: Deck Stacked Against Suspected Japanese Terrorist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese man linked to a terrorist group
traveled about 7,000 miles in the month before he was arrested on
charges of carrying three powerful pipe bombs in his car, according
to federal documents.
   Yu Kikumura, 35, pleaded innocent Friday to all charges on the
12-count federal indictment. He was arrested April 12 along the New
Jersey Turnpike and is being held without bond in New York City.
   His lawyer, William Kunstler, accused federal prosecutors of
creating an atmosphere of hysteria and paranoia by trying to link
Kikumura to the left-wing Japanese Red Army terrorist group.
   ``I'm not saying we can win on all counts,'' Kunstler told
reporters outside the courtroom. ``They made it so unfair to start
with.''
   ``There's been a lot of innuendo about Mr. Kikumura causing a
great deal of prejudice,'' Kunstler told U.S. District Judge Alfred
J. Lechner Jr. ``References to the Red Army are bad in a country
already fearful of terrorism.''
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. dismissed Kunstler's charges.
   ``This case has a lot of international implications and we have
had some contact with foreign police agencies,'' Alito said later
in a telephone interview. ``I'm quite sure that he'll be able to
get a fair trial.''
   The Japanese foreign ministry has said it suspects Kikumura of
being a member of the Red Army, which was blamed for the recent
bombing of a USO club in Naples, Italy. Authorities have said they
are investigating whether Kikumura was linked to the group.
   Court documents filed Friday revealed new details about
Kikumura's activities in the United States.
   The documents said Kikumura traveled about 7,000 miles between
March 14 and his arrest April 12, staying in numerous hotels and
motels and in a trailer at a West Virginia campground.
   The FBI filed a request to thoroughly search Kikumura's car, and
said three mechanics at a New York auto dealership reported seeing
a revolver when Kikumura brought his brown Mazda in for servicing
March 14.
   No gun was found during a search of the interior, and
authorities suspect it may be in a hidden compartment.
   Kunstler hugged Kikumura when federal marshals brought the
defendant into the courtroom in leg irons and handcuffs.
   The lawyer and his associate, Ronald Kuby, said federal
attorneys, motivated by political considerations against suspected
leftists, built up the number of counts by charging Kikumura for
each pipe bomb he allegedly carried.
   ``This is virtually a triple indictment,'' Kunstler said.
Authorities say Kikumura would face a 90-year sentence if convicted
on all 12 counts, which also include charges involving
improprieties with a passport and a visa.

<HEAD>Music Critic and Historian Dies At 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Kolodin, one of the first music critics
to pay extensive attention to phonograph records, has died after
suffering a stroke one year ago. He was 80 years old.
   Kolodin, who died Friday in a Manhattan nursing home, wrote
prolifically about a wide range of musical styles, ranging from
classical to jazz.
   He joined The New York Sun in 1932 and became its chief critic
before leaving in 1950. His first book of phonograph record reviews
appeared in 1941.
   Over the course of his career, Kolodin was music critic for The
Saturday Review from 1947 to 1982 and historian of the Metropolitan
Opera, publishing his first book on the company in 1936.
   He was working on an edition tracing the first 100 years of the
Metropolitan when he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1987.
   In 1970, Kolodin selected the classical music for the first
official White Housw music library. He also taught criticism at the
Juilliard School from 1968 to 1982.
   Kolodin was married from 1936 to 1970 to the former Irma Rose
Levy and is survived by two stepchildren. Information on funeral
arrangements was not immediately available.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Ease Over Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms swirled through the lower Mississippi Valley today
after hitting central Texas with baseball-sized hail and 11
tornadoes that uprooted palm trees, overturned trailers and ripped
roofs from several homes.
   There were no reports of serious injury. Most of the damage
Friday was near Corpus Christi and San Antonio, where wind tossed
trash cans through windows, toppled power poles and damaged cars.
   ``I saw it. There's no question in my mind. It was not a major
tornado, but it was a regular one. It was loaded with stuff and it
was doing its zig zag around,'' said Bill Easley, whose 4-month-old
daughter suffered a leg cut when a traffic light smashed through
his windshield.
   The thunderstorms swept across the lower Mississippi Valley
early this morning, but there were no reports of severe weather.
   Other thunderstorms were reported over the central Gulf Coast
region early today, bringing heavy rain. A flash flood watch was
posted for southwestern Louisiana.
   Meanwhile, a cold front crossing the western United States
brought snow and strong wind to some areas. A snow advisory was
posted for the Cascade Mountains of Oregon, the mountains and
foothills of southwestern Montana, and the mountains east of the
Continental Divide.
   Today's forecast called for showers extending from New York
across northern New England; rain and snow in the mountains from
the upper Missouri Valley across the northern Rockies and the
northern Pacific coast; showers and thunderstorms from southeast
Texas across the central Gulf of Mexico coast through Florida,
southwest Georgia and much of Alabama; winds strong and gusty over
the Rockies and southern California.
   High temperatures were expected in the 50s and 60s from New
England across the Virginias, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley,
from the Rockies to the Pacific coast; in the 90s over the desert
southwest and in the 70s and 80s over the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 29
degrees at Sexton Summit, Ore., to 78 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Teddy Kollek sent a telegram to The Los
Angeles Times protesting a cartoon published in the paper that
depicts Jesus being turned away from Jerusalem by Israeli troops,
the mayor's spokeswoman said.
   In the telegram, sent earlier this week, Kollek objected to the
implication Israeli authorities closed Jerusalem to non-Jews,
spokeswoman Sevannah Meryn said Friday.
   ``In all its history, Jerusalem has never been freer or more
open to visitors to holy places as it is now,'' Meryn quoted the
telegram as saying. ``Half a million Christians visit Jerusalem
each year, as well as some 120,000 Moslems from countries
technically at war with Israel.
   ``Even though a cartoon is only a cartoon, it must be based on
some reality, and not only on doubtful, hostile impressions and
opinions,'' it said.
   The cartoon by the newspaper's Paul Conrad, published March 30,
shows Jesus arriving at the gate to Jerusalem on a donkey, followed
by several robed figures holding palm branches. An Israeli soldier
blocks his path, saying: ``Jerusalem is a closed military area!''
   The cartoon was an apparent reference to the frequent closures
imposed by the military in the occupied territories in an effort to
quell the 5-month-old Arab uprising.
   Israel radio said the cartoon was one of two that angered
Israel's consul general in Los Angeles, Eitan Ben Tzur. The radio
said Ben Tzur proposed to the Foreign Ministry that Israel revoke
the press credentials of the Los Angeles Times reporter in Israel,
Dan Fisher.
   Yossi Beilin, the ministry's director general, was quoted as
calling the proposal a ``stupid idea'' because Fisher had nothing
to do with the cartoons.
   The second cartoon, published April 27, depicts an Israeli
soldier holding a smoking rifle standing atop a pile of
bullet-ridden bodies. The caption reads: ``I'm willing to talk
peace, but there aren't any Palestinians to talk peace with!''

<TEXT>
   A large sinkhole quickly swallowed a house
and two others teetered on the edge in a subdivision near this
central Florida town, authorities said today.
   Just two hours after it opened Friday evening, the hole had
grown to 70 yards wide and 15 feet deep, witnesses and officials
said. No injuries were reported, Highlands County sheriff's
dispatcher Kathy Buchanan said.
   ``Every once in a while you can hear a crack'' as it widens,
said John Davis, a 15-year-old who lives a few blocks from the
sinkhole. The first home was completely in the hole.
   The sinkhole also swallowed a garage and was expanding toward
two homes next door, Ms. Buchanan said.
   ``The roof's almost even with the road around it,'' Davis said.
   Dr. Barry Beck, a geologist in Orlando who directs the Florida
Sinkhole Research Institute at the University of Central Florida,
said he was surprised to see a large sinkhole in the area.
   ``We rarely if ever get any that far south,'' he said.
   Sinkholes are largely caused by the altering of the water table
in the limestone and clay under the soil, experts say.
   A sudden lowering of the water table because of irrigation or
drought can weaken and collapse underground limestone caverns,
while too much water draining into the ground can dissolve
clay-like materials and rock below.

<HEAD>Sept. 14 Trial Date Set for Helmsleys' Tax Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Billionaire real estate magnate Harry B.
Helmsley and his ``hotel queen'' wife, Leona, will stand trial on
federal tax charges before facing a similar state indictment, a
prosecutor says.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker set a Sept. 14 tentative trial
date Friday after Assistant U.S. Attorney James DeVita said the
judge presiding over the Helmsley case in state court had agreed to
let the federal trial go first.
   Helmsley, 79, and his 67-year-old wife were indicted April 15 on
state and federal charges of disguising about $4 million in
renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business expenses
and taking bogus tax deductions.
   The Helmsleys have pleaded innocent to both the 188-count state
indictment and the 47-count federal indictment.
   According to the indictments, the Helmsleys allegedly spent the
$4 million to refurbish their mansion with an enclosure for one of
the estate's two pools; a breakfast room and marble dance floor on
the roof of that enclosure; an elaborate indoor-outdoor stereo
system; more than $370,000 in landscaping; and an assortment of
furniture and paintings.

<TEXT>
   A Jewish refusenik said today he had been told he
will be given permission to leave the Soviet Union temporarily to
visit his wife in an American hospital.
   Vladimir Tufeld, 60, said he was called to the Ministry of
General Machine-Building Friday and told he should be able to
receive his passport on Tuesday or Wednesday.
   The ministry has objected to the former electrical engineer's
emigration on the basis that it could damage state security. But
Tufeld said the work the ministry cites is 15 years old.
   He first applied to emigrate in 1977.
   Tufeld's 57-year-old wife, Izolda, was granted permission in
late December to travel to the United States to be treated for a
brain tumor. She is hospitalized at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore, where she has had several operations.
   The couple's son Igor, who emgrated to Israel a decade ago, went
to Baltimore to be with his mother.
   In a telephone call to The Associated Press, Tufeld said he
planned to leave as soon as possible upon completing the Soviet
paperwork.
   The ministry did not know for how long his visa would be valid,
he said.
   Tufeld said he also planned to seek medical treatment while in
the United States. Doctors have told him he suffers from gallstones
and either a herniated disc or a tumor in his back, but Soviet
diagnostic equipment cannot distinguish which it is.
   Tufeld said the decision to allow him to leave the Soviet Union
temporarily showed the inconsistency of Soviet policy. If he does
hold information that could compromise Soviet security, there would
be no sense allowing him to travel abroad, he said.
   Emigration has increased recently, but does not approach the
level of 1979, when more than 51,000 Soviet Jews left the country.

<HEAD>Legislation To Protect U.S. Copyrights Voided After Parliament
Dissolved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dissolution of Parliament has
voided a controversial bill to protect U.S. copyrights, a legal
expert said today.
   Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda dissolved his Cabinet and the
House of Representatives on Friday after political infighting over
the legislation. Elections have been scheduled for July 24.
   Kramol Thongdhamchart of Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University said
the bill would have to be reconsidered by the next government since
it had not passed through several required steps before becoming
law.
   On Thursday, the House voted 183-134 to protect U.S. copyrights
of artistic and literary works which are widely pirated in
Thailand. The United States had indicated it might retaliate
economically if the measure did not pass.
   The bill still needed approval by the Senate and King Bhumibol
Adulyadej, the country's constitutional monarch, before becoming
law, Kramol said.
   Supporters of the 67-year-old Prem, who has served since 1980,
said the action was taken because political dissidents refused to
``play by the rules of the democratic game.''
   Political opponents criticized the prime minister for avoiding a
probable no-confidence motion in Parliament next month.
   Sixteen ministers of the Democrat Party _ the main party of
Prem's coalition government _ resigned Friday after failing to stop
party dissidents from voting against the government-backed
copyright bill. The dissidents said the legislation would force
Thailand to bow to American bullying.
   The United States had indicated it would cut tax privileges of
Thai imports if the copyright bill was rejected.
   Radio Thailand today quoted a senior government official as
saying 357 House seats would be contested in the upcoming general
election, 10 more than in the last one in 1986. Representation in
the lower house is based on population.
   Anak Sitthiprasart, director-general of the Local Administration
Department, was quoted as saying that the polling would cost $9.9
million.
   Prem, a former army general, is credited with providing Thailand
with political stability after years of coups and rapid government
changes.

   Police detained an Iraqi and an
Iranian while searching for Palestinian terrorists reportedly
planning to bomb a U.S. air base and hangouts of American
servicemen, officials said today.
   Police also picked up two bearded foreigners but released them
when they turned out to be an off-duty American serviceman and an
Australian tourist, the officials said.
   The roundups occurred late Friday and today. Police and soldiers
in this city 50 miles north of Manila remained on alert following a
report that terrorists planned to bomb Clark Air Base and bars
frequented by Americans.
   Lt. Col. Victor Signey, chief of the Philippine Constabulary's
Angeles command, said Iraqi Kamil Shariff Babi, 32, and Iranian
Ghesan Shooat Bakhsh, 32, were picked up from two buses from Manila
which soldiers stopped at a checkpoint Friday night.
   The two were detained because they could present no passports to
prove their identities, Signey said. They were not charged.
   Signey said he wanted to verify the authenticity of a U.N.
document Babi presented showing he was a political refugee.
   ``We don't know why they arrested and locked us up here,'' Babi
told reporters in his cell. ``They can verify my status with the
Department of Foreign Affairs.''
   Bakhsh said he was a medical student and his passport was
confiscated by immigration authorities in Manila.
   Angeles City police chief Lt. Col. Orlando Macaspac told
reporters the report from the Israeli intelligence service Mossad
said the bombings were to be carried out by at least eight
Palestinians.
   Spokesmen for both the Israeli and U.S. embassies said they had
no knowledge of the purported Israeli intelligence report.
   American authorities had stepped up security at Clark, Subic
Naval Base and four smaller installations after communist rebels
killed three Americans and a Filipino near Clark last October.

<TEXT>
   A priest who police say was caught
with 46 pounds of cocaine said Satan tempted him to sell narcotics
but that he used the profits to help the poor.
   Intelligence Police Commissioner Osvaldo Granadillo said Friday
the Spanish-born Venezuelan priest, Jose Luis Gil Fernandez, 57,
was arrested at Maiquetia International Airport outside Caracas
Wednesday night after police found the cocaine packed in his
suitcases.
   Gil Fernandez, who for 24 years has been the parish priest at
San Mateo, 36 miles west of Caracas, was headed for Madrid.
   A former priest, Juan Rojano Martinez, 54, and his wife Graciela
Ramos de Rojano, 46, were arrested hours later in Caracas and are
alleged to have drawn Gil Fernandez into the smuggling trade,
Granadillo said.
   ``I wouldn't say that the Venezuelan church has been penetrated
by traffickers, but (Gil Fernandez) is a priest and he is involved
in drug-running,'' Granadillo said in a phone interview.
   The priest told reporters Thursday that he had smuggled cocaine
to Madrid on two previous occasions.
   He acknowledged he was paid $9,000 for the first cargo of 19
pounds in 1984 and $32,000 for a second load of about 30 pounds. He
did not say when the second operation took place.
   The 46-pound cargo would have netted him $50,000, he said.
   ``I gave it all to the church,'' Gil Fernandez said. ``I paid
for a new chapel in San Mateo, a parish boarding school, and
decorations for the church altar, and I helped out the children who
needed the money so much. I haven't got a penny of it.
   ``I repent and I want to die ... I was tempted by Satan and I
know the damage I have done to the church and I deserve
punishment,'' he said.
   He said Rojano had pressured him to carry the drugs and that he
had asked his church superiors in March to remove him from the
parish ``because I was horribly afraid.''
   Fathe Amador Merino, spokesman for the Venezuelan Episcopal
Conference, said Friday that the church is ``disconcerted and full
of consternation and pain'' over the case.
   ``The church does not judge and will let (Venezuelan) justice
follow its course,'' Merino said.
   ``In (Gil Fernandez's) confusion and good faith, I think he
believed that this was the best use for the money made from this
nefarious trafficking business,'' he said.
   He said top Venezuela church officials visited Gil Fernandez on
Thursday ``to be close to him in these moments of confusion.''
   He said didn't know of any other cases of Venezuelan church
officials involved in drug smuggling.
   Granadillo said the priest's activities had been under
observation for over a year.
   Police said formal charges wilt be drawn up against the priest
and the Rojano couple next week.
   Drug smuggling in Venezuela carries a jail sentence of six to
thirty years, the nation's maximum penalty.

   Four protesters hurled homemade bombs
today at the headquarters of President Roh Tae-woo's governing
party, police said. There were no injuries.
   The crude bombs, made from plastic milk bottles, exploded in the
driveway of the Democratic Justice Party headquarters. The
protesters scattered leaflets charging that the December
presidential elections were rigged.
   Paek In-sung, 23, of Dongkuk University in Seoul was arrested
for allegedly taking part in the attack, police said. Three other
suspects fled.
   ``Down with the DJP which stole the will of the people in
elections,'' police quoted Paek as shouting before his arrest.
   Police later identified Paek as a member of the
``Save-the-Nation Suicide Squad,'' which organized the seizure of a
library in the U.S Cultural Center building in Seoul on Feb. 24.
Paek was sought in connection with the case.
   Five members of the radical student group stormed the center's
second-floor library to protest Washington's support for Roh.
   Roh won the Dec. 16 election when two opposition candidates
split the anti-Roh vote. Roh's governing party lost its majority in
the National Assembly during legislative elections last week.

<TEXT>
   In a rare and highly publicized Kremlin meeting
with Russian Orthodox Church leaders, Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised
greater religious tolerance and sought support for his drive for
domestic change.
   The Soviet leader also condemned past repression of religious
activity.
   He said a law now being drafted on ``freedom of conscience''
will reflect the ``tangible results of new approaches to
state-church relations in the conditions of perestroika
(restructuring) and democratization.''
   Friday's meeting was Gorbachev's first with high church
officials since he became Communist Party chief in March 1985. Such
a meeting is unusual because party doctrine professes atheism.
   The encounter, reported by the official news agency Tass, was
the lead item on the evening news program ``Vremya'' and a front
page story in today's editions of Pravda and other Soviet dailies.
   Tass said church head Patriarch Pimen had requested the meeting
with the Communist Party chief to discuss the June celebration of
the 1,000th anniversary of Christianity's arrival in Russia.
   Gorbachev said his campaign for the restructuring of society
offers benefits to religious believers but also carries obligations
that can be met during the 1,000th anniversary celebration.
   `On the eve of this event I would like to express the desire
that it is marked by the consolidation of our country's believers,
all working people, for the sake of our common great cause of
perestroika, of the renewal of socialism, complete unfolding of its
humanistic ethical potential,'' Tass quoted him as telling the
church leaders.
   Gorbachev has said his overhaul of society and the economy faces
opposition at many levels, so the appeal to church leaders was seen
as an effort to enlist the support of another element of Soviet
society.
   He did not specify what the new law governing religion would say
or when it would be completed, but said it would ``reflect the
interests of religious organizations.''
   The law now in effect, dating back to 1929, requires
registration of all religious groups, and prevents charitable
activities and religious education of the young.
   Archbishop Kiril of Smolensk told a news conference on March 31
that the rewriting of the law ``will open the possibility for a
fuller church life for all believers'' in the Soviet Union.
   Under Soviet power, the Russian Orthodox Church has been subject
at times to harassment and violent anti-religious campaigns. In
1961, Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev predicted the complete
elimination of religion in the Soviet Union by 1980.
   Pimen, the 77-year-old patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, told
Gorbachev that Soviet religious leaders ``ardently pray for the
success of the restructuring process, and strive to do everything
possible for its development,'' Tass said.
   However, Pimen said without elaborating that ``not all problems
of church life receive their resolution so far.''
   In his talk with the prelates, Gorbachev acknowledged the
suffering of religious believers under the late Soviet dictator
Josef V. Stalin.
   ``Mistakes made with regard to the church and believers in the
1930s and the years that followed are being rectified,'' Gorbachev
said, without referring to Stalin by name.
   Religious believers were among the millions of people killed or
imprisoned under Stalin. Churches and their property were destroyed
during Stalin's drive to establish collectives.
   Under Gorbachev, Soviet media have been reporting extensively on
Stalin's mistakes and repression.
   The millenium of Russian Christianity has raised the question of
a possible visit by Pope John Paul II. The Polish-born pontiff,
head of the Roman Catholic Church, has frequently expressed his
desire to visit Soviet Catholics, but has publicly disclosed that
he has been refused permission at least twice.
   However, a Tass official said on April 20 that changing domestic
conditions in the Soviet Union could pave the way for the pope's
first Soviet pilgrimage.
   ``I am absolutely sure that this climate (conducive to a papal
visit) is being created,'' Anatoly A. Krasikov, Tass deputy
director general, told a news conference in Rome.

<HEAD>Turkey Denies Role in Armenian Terrorist's Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today denied involvement in
the assassination of a man believed to be the leader of an Armenian
terrorist group.
   The man, identified as Agop Agopian, was shot and killed
Thursday outside his home in Athens, Greece, in an attack by two
masked men.
   The group Agopian founded and led, the Armenian Secret Army for
the Liberation of Armenia, accused Turkey and ``imperialist
allies'' Friday of masterminding the killing. Greek newspapers
published similar claims.
   But Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu today said
``such claims are absurd. Turkey never used these methods in
dealing with terrorism.''
   No one claimed responsibility for Agopian's killing.
   One report, from the Armenian Secret Army in Beirut, Lebanon,
said Agopian was fired from the organization in late 1987.
   The organization, founded in 1975, has taken responsibility for
more than 60 attacks against Turkish targets, including the
killings of about 30 Turkish diplomats and dependents in western
Europe and the United States. His group said it carried out the
July 1983 bombing of the Turkish Airlines desk at Orly Airport in
Paris that killed eight people and injured 56.
   The Marxist organization seeks an independent Armenian state in
eastern Turkey. It also demands vengeance for what it says was the
massacre of 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915-1916.
   Turkish officials acknowledge 300,000 Armenians died after
Ottoman Empire officials deported the country's 1.4 million
Armenians to Syria during World War I.
   Independent historians say at least 600,000 Armenians died on
the trip.

   The government today released two former
underground Solidarity leaders from prison in a secret deal with
Roman Catholic church officials, but the activists refused to leave
the country, family members said.
   Witnesses and relatives said the two were then returned to a
Warsaw prison, but their status remained unclear. A spokesman for
the communist government declined comment.
   The two, Kornel Morawiecki and Andrzej Kolodziej, were driven to
Warsaw's airport to board a flight to Rome, but they decided to
stay in Poland after meeting with family members.
   The two were released from Warsaw's Rakowiecka prison early
today in an apparent deal between the Roman Catholic church and
communist authorities. Both men were leaders of a militant
Solidarity splinter group.
   They were given multiple exit-and-entry passports and were
supposed to go to Rome for unspecified medical treatment.
   But after meeting with relatives in an airport lounge and
hearing of a new wave of strikes, they decided to stay in the
country, relatives said.
   ``They are staying,'' Morawiecki's daughter, Anna, told
reporters at the airport. ``They may go at a later date, but they
want to think it over.''
   Morawiecki and Kolodziej were driven back from the airport in
two umarked cars. Witnesses who followed said they were returned to
Rakowiecka prison by security officials.
   Also present at the airport meeting were three priests from the
episcopate and a lawyer. The priests declined to comment.
   Speaking later to reporters in Warsaw, Morawiecki's daughter
said she was surprised that the two men were taken back to prison.
   ``At first, they agreed to go (abroad). But there was no
ultimatum,'' she said. ``They wanted to talk to the families, to
consult with each other, because they had no such opportunity in
prison.''
   She said the two men wanted at least 24 hours to make up their
minds.
   Ewa Maria Stoja, Kolodziej's girlfriend, said official documents
indicated the two men were being released at the recommendation of
a commission of prison doctors ``due to the required urgent medical
examination, which may also take place abroad.''
   The two women said Kolodziej suffered from ulcers and teeth
problems, while Morawiecki had ulcer symptoms, poor eyesight, and
heart and kidney ailments.
   Anna Morawiecka said the release of the two men was arranged by
church officials and that there had been ``some intervention'' by
Pope John Paul II.
   Morawiecki, who was was arrested Nov. 9, was chairman of the
militant splinter group Fighting Solidarity.
   He had been in hiding since the December 1981 martial law
crackdown on the labor group Solidarity. The next year, he formed
Fighting Solidarity, which differs from the outlawed independent
labor federation because it advocates anti-communist political
goals. Solidarity emphasizes social and union issues.
   Kolodziej headed Fighting Solidarity from the time of
Morawiecki's arrest until his own capture in January. He had been
in hiding since 1985.
   Authorities alleged that the two were part of a ring that
attempted to smuggle equipment intended for terrorist use from
Sweden. They were never formally charged.
   In a statement in November, Kolodziej denied the allegations.
   A third, less prominent Fighting Solidarity activist, Krzystof
Szymanski, was also released today.
   In another development, Jan Andrzej Gorny, the Solidarity leader
in the southern Silesian industrial region, was released after an
appeals court on Friday suspended his sentence, Solidarity sources
said.
   Gorny was serving an 18-month sentence at a prison in Katowice
after being convicted of failing to pay alimony and using false
identity cards.
   In September 1986, the government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
issued a broad amnesty for political prisoners. Since then, the
political activists it has jailed have been held on criminal
charges.

<DATELINE>TUSKEGEE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's decision to throw out his
temporary restraining order against Tuskegee University means
students who owe the school more than $300 will not be allowed to
take final exams next week.
   Macon County Circuit Judge Howard F. Bryan had halted the
predominantly black private school's crackdown Wednesday. But after
a six-hour hearing Friday, Bryan dissolved the order.
   University officials estimate there are 600 students who owe
more than $300 each, and argued that Bryan's original order had
hampered their ability to collect. Students said the crackdown was
issued without adequate notice and threatened those students who
were having financial difficulties.
   University President Benjamin Payton said he was ``deeply
saddened that it was necessary to go to this length to make that
point.''
   ``This is not a case of Tuskegee University fighting its
students,'' he said. ``It's a case of Tuskegee University insisting
that students learn very important lessons for life.''
   Bryan ordered the school to leave its business office open over
the weekend so students can make payments before exams begin Monday.
   The university's crackdown on overdue fees had sparked a week of
protests, including a sit-in at the administration building last
weekend.
   Michael Pintard, president of the Student Government
Association, said the ruling was a ``serious miscarriage of
justice.''
   Pintard said university officials should have identified
``categories of students'' who couldn't make payments because of
financial difficulties, and worked out a timetable for those
students.
   Bryan said he agreed with the students' complaints on a personal
level, adding, ``Prohibiting students from attending class is an
exceedingly drastic action, with as little notice as was given.''
   But he said he had no legal grounds to stop the school policy
because the students didn't show that the university's policy was
arbitrary or would irreparably injure them.

   Tamil rebels hiding behind bushes
opened fire on a bus and its army escort Saturday, killing 10
people and injuring six others, officials said.
   The military officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said five Sinhalese soldiers and five civilians were killed in the
attack in dense jungle near Vavuniya, about 135 miles north of
Colombo.
   More than 50 guerrillas fired from both sides of the road, the
officials said.
   ``The soldiers were escorting the civilian bus, and they died
fighting the attackers. We believe the attackers suffered heavy
casualties, but we don't have details,'' one official said.
   He said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest Tamil
militia, was responsible for the attack.
   The ambush came a day after President Junius R. Jayewardene's
United National Party won a majority of seats to four new district
councils. The elections were boycotted by major opposition parties.
   Tamil militants have been fighting the Sinhalese-dominated
government for a separate homeland in northern and eastern
provinces for five years. In July, India and Sri Lanka signed a
peace accord aimed at ending the ethnic war by granting some
autonomy to the minority Tamils.
   The accord has been rejected by the Tamil Tigers, who control
major areas of Northern Province. India has sent more than 50,000
troops to its island neighbor to disarm the Tigers and enforce the
accord.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils, who are 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people, say they are discriminated against by
the Buddhist Sinhalese, who form 75 percent of the population and
control the government and the military.
   India, also predominantly Hindu, intervened at the request of
its own large Tamil minority.

   The Soviet Union says it will withdraw Red Army
troops from Afghanistan, but it appears that the Kremlin is
creating a buffer zone along the Soviet border in the northern
Afghan area. Here is a report from the area.

<TEXT>
   MAZAR-E-SHARIF, Afghanistan (AP) _ A northern strip of
Afghanistan, rich in agriculture and natural resources, is being
transformed into a Soviet buffer zone, despite the planned
withdrawal of Red Army troops.
   All nine Afghan provinces bordering the Soviet Union recently
were grouped to form a new ``Northern Zone'' with a de facto
capital in Mazar-e-Sharif, ostensibly to coordinate development
programs.
   Virtually isolated from the rest of Afghanistan by the towering
Hindu Kush mountains, the ethnic minorities of the north are closer
in language and culture to the Soviets across the border than to
their fellow Afghans in the south.
   ``For several months, there has been an escalation of
Sovietization of the north,'' a foreign diplomat in Kabul said.
``Thousands of young people have gone to school in the Soviet
Union. Some come home with Russian wives. It's a very classical
colonization.''
   The diplomat, who spoke on condition he not to be identified
further, said the Soviet military withdrawal does not mean the
Kremlin is abandoning Afghanistan while President Najib's
government is still under attack by U.S.-supplied guerrillas.
   ``The Soviets do not want to lose Afghanistan. The north is a
Soviet zone,'' he said.
   He noted that the ``Northern Zone'' includes Faryab province,
the Afghan oil region, and said Faryab ``is already completely
dominated by the Soviet Union.''
   The Soviets have pledged to start withdrawing their 115,000
soldiers from Afghanistan on May 15 under a U.N.-mediated accord
signed with the United States two weeks ago in Geneva.
   Mazar-e-Sharif, the administrative center of Balkh province,
sits on a flat plain 40 miles from the Amu River that forms the
Soviet border.
   Almost every car in the dusty town is Soviet-made. Shop names
are written in the Russian alphabet as well as in the
Arabic-Persian script used by Afghanistan. Soviet-style posters
extolling the virtues of work and socialism loom over the streets.
   Early this year, references to the new ``Northern Zone'' started
appearing in speeches and newspaper articles in Kabul, the Afghan
capital.
   ``The main point behind such rearrangement was to coordinate
projects and needs, because this area enjoys rich natural resources
_ gas, coal, others,'' said Mohammad Sharif, secretary of the Balkh
province central committee of the People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan.
   Afghan officials quickly point out that other Afghan provinces
also have been grouped into regional zones. But only the ``Northern
Zone'' has its own deputy prime minister.
   Najibullah Masir, minister of mines and industry and former head
of the Afghan-Soviet Friendship Society, was named to the post two
months ago.
   Mazar-e-Sharif and Kabul, 180 miles south of the border, are
expected to be the last cities vacated by Soviet troops before the
Feb. 15, 1989, deadline for final withdrawal.
   According to Afghan and Western observers who spoke on condition
of anonymity, Mazar-e-Sharif is one of the most pacified areas of
the country.
   In 1987 the official Soviet news media acknowledged that
anti-Soviet guerrillas had launched at least two attacks across the
border on Soviet soil. According to a U.S. State Department
publication, the Soviets retaliated with attacks that caused
``enormous'' civilian casualties.
   Sharif said the Soviet-backed Afghan government now controls all
but 80 of the 433 villages in Balkh province. These figures could
not be verified, but 18 months ago Afghan officials said only half
the villages were under government control.
   The nine northern provinces have an estimated 2 million to 3
million inhabitants, about one-fourth of Afghanistan's total
population.
   Nearly all the people belong to the Uzbek, Kirghiz, Tajik and
Turkmen tribes _ the same ethnic minorities who live across the
border in the Soviet republics of Uzbekistan, Kirghizia, Tajikistan
and Turkmenistan.
   Western sources in Kabul say they strongly doubt the guerrillas,
or Islamic holy warriors, can take control of Kabul. But if it does
happen, they say the northern zone could serve as a refuge and
restaging area for the Najib government.
   ``If the situation is very bad in Kabul, the government could go
to the north for reconquest,'' a non-American diplomat said. ``But
I should be very surprised if Kabul falls. I think Kabul will be
very well-defended by the Afghan army with Soviet advisers.''

<TEXT>
   At 3.15 p.m. most Tuesdays and Thursdays, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher marches into Parliament for one of
Britain's liveliest political traditions _ Question Time.
   Armed with a thick notebook of statistics, she jousts with
questioning lawmakers amid the roar of others frantic to make a
point. Fifteen minutes later she departs, and the House of Commons
begins its business for the day.
   The public gallery is packed for Question Time, and millions
more hear the rhetorical fireworks later on radio and TV. Starting
this fall, they'll be able to see the action, too, following a
Commons decision to let in television cameras.
   Born in 1721 to allow lawmakers to obtain information, Question
Time has developed into a test of ministerial mettle and, some say,
a publicity show. In 1901 a House leader called it a ``scandal,''
and today, many say it is more furious than ever.
   ``It's turned into a kind of gladiatorial battle,'' says London
School of Economics Professor Alan Beattie, a specialist in
Parliament. ``It's very noisy and very crude.''
   ``It's become a waste of time,'' says Tam Dalyell, a Laborite
expelled from the House for five days last year for calling Mrs.
Thatcher a ``liar'' in Parliament. ``It's hullabaloo.''
   The curtain rises on Question Time, a mixture of ancient pomp
and modern informality, as 62-year-old Mrs. Thatcher takes her seat
on the government side of the House. Lawmakers lounging on their
green leather pew-like benches sit up, alert.
   Question from Ron Davies of the opposition Labor Party:
   ``In her endeavor to re-establish the bonds of family life, has
the prime minister ever given any consideration to the value of a
wife? Is she aware that the Forestry Commission ... is offering in
compensation two pounds ($3.80) per week for each keeper's wife?
   ``Given that the Forestry Commission pays the same keepers 45
pence (85 cents) a week for a ferret and 2.30 pounds ($4.37) a week
for a dog, should she not intervene?''
   Mrs. Thatcher replies: ``I think the honorable gentleman will be
aware that the budget set out considerably to help wives ... We on
this side value them very highly.''
   The sound and fury rises steadily, and by the time Labor leader
Neil Kinnock begins criticizing Mrs. Thatcher's welfare reforms,
the prime minister's voice is barely audible.
   She calls Kinnock's remarks ``utterly futile,'' as lawmakers
scream ``Answer the Question!,'' ``You're Wrong!'' and Speaker of
the House Bernard Weatherill cries ``Order! Order!''
   Mrs. Thatcher relies heavily on statistics for her replies,
while some of her predecessors have preferred barbed repartee.
   The late Winston Churchill was once asked: ``Is the prime
minister aware of the deep concern felt by the people of this
country at the whole question of the Korean conflict?'' To which
Churchill sniffed: ``I am well aware of the deep concern felt by
the honorable member in many matters above his comprehension.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's near-decade in power has led to frustration in
opposition ranks, and her personality has caused more friction than
perhaps any other British leader, Beattie says.
   ``The strategy she adopts is that you don't worry if the
opposition hates you, you worry about whether your own side thinks
you've won,'' says Beattie. Some say speakers tolerate more
disorder both in debate and Question Time to ensure the protection
of minority party rights, but that tolerance has led to increased
unruliness throughout the House.
   One of the worst recent incidents occurred not during Question
Time but at the end of a dramatic debate on taxation.
   In a show of anti-Thatcher rage, Labor hard-liner Ron Brown
dropped and dented the gold and silver mace, the club that is a
symbol of royal authority in the chamber. He was expelled for 20
working days after refusing to apologize.
   However, Weatherill says he feels that generally ``the House
proceeds in good order.''
   He told the British Broadcasting Corp. he also believes Question
Time may quiet down when television enters the chamber for six
months this fall.
   ``I think the new stars are likely to be the reasonable
members,'' he said.
   Opponents argue that TV will encourage showing off. Strathclyde
University in Scotland has offered to teach lawmakers how to
perform for television for $285 a day but says no one has signed up.

   Seventy performers from the Moscow State Circus,

Britain for the circus' first major tour in 20 years.
   The performers flew into London's Heathrow Airport on Friday for
a 14-week tour, which begins Sunday at Battersea Park in south
London and includes stops in other cities across the country.
   Vicki Charlton, chairman of the Entertainment Corp., organizers
of the tour, said a smaller version of the circus visited three

   Among the performers will be a two trapeze acts, high wire
performers, acrobats known as the Moscow Builders, and a Cossack

<HEAD>Committee Calls For New Standards For English Teaching</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The birthplace of English had better mind its p's
and q's and improve its English teaching methods at the same time,
according to a government study which criticizes how the language
is taught in Great Britain.
   The study, released Friday by a government-appointed committee,
concluded that most English teachers in Britain were not properly
equipped for the job and recommended that many be retrained.
   Education Secretary Kenneth Baker welcomed the report. He said
his department will incorporate its recommendations into a new
curriculum planned by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government in a major shake-up of the nation's
educational system.
   ``Most schools no longer teach old-fashioned grammar. But little
has been put in its place,'' Baker said last year when he
established the committee to study the situation.
   The 90-page report follows a yearlong inquiry by the committee
into how English is taught in Britain. Panel members include Peter
Levi, professor of poetry at Oxford University; novelists Antonia
Byatt and Keith Waterhouse; broadcaster Robert Robinson; and poet
P.J. Kavanagh. They visited schools across the nation before
writing the report.
   The report says all teachers should be trained in English and
that each school should have a teacher whose sole job is to ensure
that the language is used properly.
   It adds that national standards should be established to be met
by children at the ages of seven, 11 and 16. However, the committee
rejected a return to memorizing grammar rules.
   ``We're not anxious to go back to the idea that you simply learn
these things by rote, because all the evidence is that that doesn't
in fact improve the effectiveness of the children's use of the
language,'' said Sir John Kingman, vice-chancellor of Bristol
University and head of the committee.
   Kingman rejected the notion that the new standards would
discriminate against pupils from ethnic minority groups.
   Of Britain's 56 million people, about 2.45 million are
non-whites, mostly immigrants from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean
whose children were born and raised in Britain.
   ``The fact that they may speak a different language at home is
irrelevant, because the English language is the way they become
full members of English society,'' Kingman said.
   ``It is a way of ensuring that we do not have an underclass of
non-English speakers who are cut off from getting a job and having
a career.''
   The opposition Labor Party and the 184,400-member National Union
of Teachers also welcomed the report.
   But Michael Simon, head of the Inner London Education
Authority's English Center, said he was concerned about the notion
that all pupils must conform to a standard form of English.
   ``About 80 percent of pupils do not speak standard English
although they speak something very close to it. Any attempt to get
kids to speak standard English will just disable them as
speakers,'' he said.
   Kingman, a mathematician, said English teachers were not being
trained well in Britain and that children were suffering.
   ``We take a fairly dim view of English teacher training,'' he
said.
   The report said that by age 7, children should read passages of
simple sentences, understand the spoken language, spell common
words and write legibly; by 11, they should use punctuation and
paragraphs, argue their case on an issue and be aware of dialects.
   It said 16-year-olds should be able to express feelings, ideas
and arguments in writing and speech, make comparisions between
English and other languages and use technical terms to describe
language.
   English is the first language of 320 million people around the
world and is spoken daily by about a billion people.

<HEAD>College Professor Accused Of Running House Of Prostitution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college professor who once claimed to
operate the ``cleanest massage parlor in California'' has been
charged with conspiracy to maintain a house of prostitution, law
enforcement officials said.
   Hal Mintz, chairman of the business department at East Los
Angeles College, is to be arraigned Thursday on the prostitution
charge and two counts of income tax evasion, according to Deputy
District Attorney Eldon Fox.
   The tax charges accuse Mintz of failing to file a return with
the state Franchise Tax Board for 1985 and 1986. Financial records
seized at his home in San Marino indicate he earned at least
$200,000 each of those years, Fox said Friday.
   Mintz's attorney, Anthony Glassman, said his client would plead
innocent to the conspiracy charge.
   ``Hal may have been lax, he may have been negligent in some
things, but he didn't know what was going on at the massage
parlor,'' Glassman said.
   The attorney said that while Mintz had not filed state tax
returns for 1985 and 1986, he was in the process of doing so when
his records were seized.
   The Beverly Hills Massage Parlor, located across the street from
the West Hollywood City Hall, adjacent to upscale Beverly Hills,
was closed in February after authorities said it was being used as
a house of prostitution.
   Six former employees of the massage parlor have agreed to
testify against Mintz in return for immunity from prosecution, Fox
said.
   A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Community College
District said the district is evaluating Mintz's position at the
college.
   ``Under the terms of the state Education Code, the particular
charge against Mintz does not enable us to automatically suspend
him,'' said Warren Kinsler, the district's general counsel.

   Neither Michael Dukakis nor his friend and
money-raiser Bob Farmer assumed great success when they sat down at
the Massachusetts governor's breakfast table one day in the fall of
1986.
   Dukakis was casting an eye toward the presidency, and he had one
question.
   ``He said, `Look, if I decide to go for this thing, will the
money be there to wage a credible campaign?''' Farmer recalled.
   Farmer responded with some optimism, but a day later he had
second thoughts. He called Dukakis.
   ``I'm troubled by one thing,'' he told Dukakis. ``I've never
raised money for a guy who's at 1 percent in the polls.''
   As it turned out, Farmer underestimated.
   Dukakis has been underestimated all along in this presidential
campaign, much as his fall opponent, Republican George Bush, has
been.
   Critics fault Dukakis for a cold aloofness, a lack of passion,
and a presence that creates barely a ripple outside a staged event.
Not until Pennsylvania's primary Tuesday, where he won by 2-to-1
over Jesse Jackson, did polls show that as many as half those who
voted for Dukakis actually supported him strongly.
   ``This guy really is the Rodney Dangerfield of presidential
politics,'' said Bob Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale's 1984
campaign. ``This guy gets more criticism for a winner than anybody
I've seen in modern presidential politics.''
   ``Dukakis is a man who is easy to underestimate,'' says his
friend, Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. ``But he is extremely competent
and well disciplined and has good values _ and all that comes
through to the voters.''
   Dukakis had other advantages, aside from money. He was helped by
geography and a primary calender that fit nicely with his bases of
support.
   And like any winner he was lucky. He was a beneficiary of Gary
Hart's political self-immolation, the disasters and missteps that
befell other opponents, the reluctance of New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
to enter the race, and the lack of national stature of his
opponents.
   Dukakis announced his candidacy on April 29, 1987 with a direct
shot at the then front-runner Hart and his campaign of ``new
ideas.''
   ``Ask more than whether we have new ideas,'' Dukakis said. ``Ask
whether we have already made new ideas work.''
   He called himself a long-shot when he entered the race. But
within a month all that was altered by the revelations of Hart's
relationship with a young woman.
   ``I don't think you have any real sense at the time you make
that kind of announcement what's likely to happen,'' Dukakis said
in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ``I said at the
time it's a very, very long shot. I meant it. We're all long shots.
I mean, who knows? It's a very unpredictable business.
   ``I thought that if we could organize well and raise sufficient
funds and really work at it _ as I always have _ there was a
possibility that we could do it. It's never more than a possibility
when you start.''
   Dukakis sustained his theme for a year: never mind the charisma,
here was a politician who had made government work.
   He offered as evidence the Massachusetts economic turnaround,
notwithstanding critics who said he did no more than stay out of
the way of a boom that was coming anyway.
   ``I don't think people are all that naive _ I don't think
anybody really thought he created the Massachusetts Miracle out of
whole cloth,'' said Clinton. ``But they knew that he'd been a part
of it and that he'd seen the future they wanted to achieve.''
   Dukakis campaigned in Iowa with the knowledge that he had a sure
win a week later in New Hampshire, his neighboring state. He
campaigned in the South, potentially hostile territory, by leaving
Dixie to Jackson and Sen. Albert Gore Jr. and concentrating on
atypical Southern voters: Jews and retirees in South Florida,
Hispanics in Texas, liberals throughout the region.
   He was credited with a strong organization and was able to
withstand the loss of his campaign manager and top aide, John
Sasso, in the flap over Sasso's role in campaign sabotage that
revealed Sen. Joseph Biden's plagiarism and lapses of judgment.
   He was also lucky that his third place showing in Iowa wasn't
viewed as the setback it might have been. Dukakis campaign chairman
and longtime friend Paul Brountas said his Iowa finish was
``perceived as a strong showing.''
   ``Part of the plan was to do well enough in Iowa so you could
preserve the geographic advantage you have in New Hampshire,'' he
said. ``Had he not done well in Iowa, his support in New Hampshire
may have softened.''
   Critics and supporters will argue over whether Dukakis's belated
emergence was a triumph of money over message, but it is
indisputable that his financial success made much of it possible.
   Farmer, who had been treasurer for John Glenn in 1984, initially
thought he could raise $6.5 million by the Iowa caucuses in early
February.
   His figure was in line with what the wealthiest of the other
Democrats were able to raise. But the Dukakis campaign raised $17
million by Iowa's caucus night _ a financial triumph that gave
Dukakis an enormous advantage over his rivals and paved the way for
his emergence as the likely Democratic presidential nominee.
   His bankroll allowed him to run campaigns everywhere, and to
keep staff in place while opponents were collapsing their efforts
into Iowa and New Hampshire.
   He was prepared, as a result, when the campaign moved into the
foreign territory of the South and he was able to survive
consecutive losses in Illinois and Michigan. He headed North after
Super Tuesday with $2 million in the bank, while his opponents were
broke or in debt.
   How was Dukakis able to do it and not the others? One reason was
the network Farmer built, asking not just for contributions but for
each significant donor to produce $10,000 in contributions from
their friends.
   He got enthusiastic support from Greek-Americans around the
country, tapping an igorned but often affluent community that
contributed close to one-fifth of his total.
   Importantly, Dukakis's own state had a booming economy and
active Democrats accustomed to giving.
   The race for money, in fact, can be considered one of the major
contests of 1988. And Dukakis won it going away.
   ``It isn't that candidates lose heart, it's that they run out of
money,'' Farmer said. ``Money is the winnowing factor in this
process.''
   Former rivals and current supporters alike say the critics of
his dispassionate style have missed something that voters found in
Dukakis's cool temperament.
   Mark Mellman, polltaker for Gore, said research done for that
campaign found a startlingly positive reaction among voters to
Dukakis on television, particularly in his commercials.
   He communicated, Mellman said, ``an inner strength, a quiet
passion, an intelligent commitment to substance.''
   ``That is not the typical interpretation that's put on the guy,
but I'm convinced of it from research that we have done,'' Mellman
said. ``Not sort of rip-roaring, table-thumping passion, but deep
concern and deep conviction. That speaks well of him. That
establishes a bond of trust with the voter.''

   Water rationing begins Sunday, but city
residents won't discover how much water they will be allotted for
another two weeks.
   Beginning May 15, customers will receive notices telling them
how much water they can use, the San Francisco Water Department
said Friday.
   ``We are asking people to wait until they get their allotment
before they start saying they won't have enough water. They should
wait until they know,'' said James Cooney, general manager at the
Water Department.
   ``I would encourage them to start saving water now and not panic
until they see how much they will get,'' Cooney said.
   Reduced rain and snow has lowered reservoirs from northern
California into Oregon and Washington.
   The rationing program, adopted Thursday by the city's Public
Utilities Commission, is aimed at reducing consumption by 25
percent compared with 1987.
   Among other things, the new rules prohibit washing sidewalks,
operating decorative fountains and serving water to restaurant
patrons except on request.
   The rationing program will depend on public cooperation, and the
only penalities will be increased rates for excessive use and
possible installation of flow restrictors for big wasters, said
Cooney.

<HEAD>Economy Friendly To Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From George Bush's viewpoint, the American
economy couldn't be friendlier: consumer spending is booming,
unemployment falling and the prospects of inflation too ethereal to
stir much worry.
   In fact, the economy's prospects appear so bright that one
leading economic forecasting firm has an economic model showing
Bush will win the presidency on Nov. 8 with 53 percent of the vote.
   That forecast by Data Resources Inc. uses a computer model which
combines what is already known about the economy's performance over
the past six months with the firm's expectations for growth and
inflation between now and election day.
   Using an economic model to forecast an election still six months
may be going out on a limb, but economists said the exercise does
highlight the importance economic issues play in voters' decisions.
   ``The model has been correct in the past. People do vote their
pocketbooks,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI.
``When things are going well, they want more of the same and that
is what Mr. Bush is promising.''
   At the start of the year, things did not look as promising for
the Republicans. The 508-point stock market plunge on Oct. 19 had
spawned widespread fears that the country would fall into a
recession in the early part of 1988.
   In the three months following the collapse, consumer spending
fell by the biggest amount since 1980 when Jimmy Carter was
president. Consumer spending accounts for two-thrids of overall
economic activity, and that decline toppled the country into a
brief recession which is cited as one of the factors leading to
Carter's re-election defeat.
   But this time around, the economy kept rolling. The government
reported last Tuesday that consumer spending, propelled by strong
auto sales, rebounded nicely in the first three months of the year,
providing the momentum for 2.3 percent growth in the overall
economy, as measured by the gross national product.
   The economic expansion, which has now lasted for a peacetime
record of 64 months, has driven the unemployment rate down to a
nine-year low of 5.6 percent.
   The unexpectedly strong growth this year and the big gains in
employment are raising some concerns that inflation is about to
become a problem again. Economists are worried that with job
markets growing tight and many industries operating at high
capacity rates, demand will start to push prices higher.
   Prices at both the retail and wholesale levels took a big jump
up in March, raising fears in financial markets that the Federal
Reserve will be forced to step in with a dose of higher interest
rates aimed at cooling off demand.
   Some analysts believe the central bank has already tightened
slightly and they predict interest rates will be pushed up another
notch if next Friday's unemployment report shows the jobless rate
dipped further to 5.5 percent in April.
   But many analysts believe the increases in inflation and
interest rates likely to occur over the next six months will be so
small that they won't prove worrisome to voters.
   Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, predicted
that interest rates will only increase by one-half to one full
percentage point and this will not be enough to curb what he
expects will be generally good economic growth this year.
   ``If the economy does as well as expected between now and
November that should be awfully good news for the Republicans
because presidents get the credit or the blame for the economy's
performance whether they deserve it or not,'' Straszheim said.
   The Democrats can be expected to try to focus the campaign on
such problems as the huge budget and trade deficits and the unease
Americans feel about the country's slide in the past eight years
into the status of the world's leading debtor nation.
   ``Questions about whether the United States will be able to
compete in the future and what Americans' living standards will be
should affect the outcome as well,'' said Lawrence Chimerine,
president of the WEFA Group, another economist forecasting firm.
   But other analysts said these issues remain distant abstractions
when compared to such pocket-book matters as jobs and inflation.
   Analysts also said that President Reagan's exceptional luck with
the economy appears to be rubbing off on his vice president.
   While the country had to endure the steepest recession since the
Depression in 1981-82, the recovery was well underway by the time
Reagan had to run for re-election.
   Many economists are predicting the next downturn will begin in
1989, leaving plenty of time for the recovery to start before the
next presidential election.
   ``It is almost magical the way the economy has performed the
right way for Reagan at just the right time,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Bush is a lucky man to be
second in line to the luck of the Irish.''

<HEAD>Cuba Builds Up Angola Forces, US Official Says</HEAD>

   Cuba has quietly expanded its troop commitment
to Angola by up to 10,000 over the past five months while taking an
increasingly active role in southern Africa peace negotiations,
according to U.S. officials.
   The officials made the disclosure as Cuba, along with the United
States, South Africa and Angola, prepared for a new round of talks
on an array of southern African issues.
   The talks, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in London, mark
the first time that South African and Angolan representatives have
agreed to sit at the same negotiating table to discuss a peace
settlement. The two countries have been military rivals for more
than a decade.
   Cuba had not taken a direct part in southern Africa peace
negotiations until January when Cuban officials joined Angolan
negotiators for talks with a State Department delegation in Angola.
   The U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said that
Cuba is believed to have had between 35,000 and 37,000 troops in
Angola as of last November. Since then 8,000 to 10,000 Cuban troops
have been sent to Angola, bringing the total to between 43,000 and
45,000, the officials said.
   This is believed to be the largest number of Cuban troops
deployed in Angola since they were first sent there in 1975 when
Angola won its independence from Portugal.
   If the Cuban and U.S. populations are compared, the current
Cuban troop commitment in Angola is proportionally far greater than
the American military involvement in Vietnam in 1968 when 525,000
U.S. servicemen _ the all-time high _ were stationed there.
   Since early March, about 5,000 Cuban troops have been sent to
the western Angolan city of Benguela, the officials said. The area
is not close to any combat zones in Angola, and U.S. officials said
Cuba's motives for the buildup are not clear.
   The Cubans generally have stayed away from combat zones in
Angola's civil war but a Cuban defector, Rafael del Pino Diaz, has
said that Cuba has suffered about 10,000 casualties since 1975.
   Cuban troops were initially sent to Angola that year to protect
the country's Marxist government against attacks from South Africa.
   Recently, South African forces have been assisting the
U.S.-backed UNITA rebel group in Angola. This is one of the issues
delegates from the four countries will discuss at this week's
meetings in London.
   Angola is eager for an end to the South African presence as well
as a suspension of U.S. aid to UNITA.
   The highest priority for the United States and South Africa is
an agreement for the early withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.
   South Africa has said that once that hurdle is cleared, it will
implement a United Nations resolution calling for independence and
black majority rule in Namibia, Angola's southern neighbor which
has been ruled by Pretoria since early in the century.
   However, there has been no agreement on a timetable for the
mutual withdrawal of foreign forces from both Angola and Namibia.
   The head of the American delegation at Geneva will be Assistant
Secretary of State Chester Crocker, who has been attempting since
1981 to negotiate both Namibian independence and a Cuban troop
withdrawal from Angola.

<TEXT>
   Born poor in Greenville, S.C., 46 years ago,
Jesse Jackson has capitalized on his role as the nation's most
prominent black leader to maintain a comfortable lifestyle and
accumulate sizable wealth _ all without holding elected office or
drawing a regular paycheck.
   He has kept busy, even without his portfolio as leader of
Operation PUSH, the civil rights group he founded and led until
before his 1984 presidential campaign.
   In recent years his income has run into six figures, and before
his current campaign Jackson traveled the world far and wide,
acquiring foreign policy experience during trips financed in large
part by black church groups and business supporters and in some
measure by sympathetic political groups or foreign nations.
   The Democratic contender's most recent financial disclosure
form, which presidential candidates are required to submit, shows
he had assets worth a minimum of $347,010, and possibly much more.
   He owns modest houses in Chicago's South Side and in Washington,
D.C. and the Greenville home his mother occupies. His wife owns
stock worth at least $250,000, records show.
   And, according to spokesman Frank Watkins, Jackson has signed a
contract with Simon & Schuster that brought a $350,000 advance for
his soon-to-be published autobiography. Some of that money will be
shared with people helping write the book, Watkins said.
   With the eager assistance of black churches, business
supporters, special interest groups and host governments, Jackson
has managed to travel the world as a self-made diplomat on missions
of his own making.
   He has embraced PLO leader Yasser Arafat in Lebanon; accepted a
cigar from Fidel Castro in Cuba; conferred with Pope John Paul II
in Rome; advocated anti-apartheid civil disobedience in South
Africa; and persuaded Syria to release Navy pilot Robert O. Goodman
Jr. whose plane was shot down over Lebanon by Syrian gunners.
   He even showed up at the first summit meeting between Mikhail
Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan. Gorbachev gave him an audience.
   The Democratic presidential contender says he has visited at
least 35 countries and met with about 60 heads of state.
   The question _ who pays for Jesse Jackson? _ is difficult to
answer partly because Jackson has not released his recent income
tax filings or other financial data beyond what is required by
federal election law.
   But no matter where Jackson goes, someone else often pays.
   On the campaign trail, Jackson loves to tell how he allied
himself with the workingman by standing with the striking
meatpackers in Cudahy, Wis., in their hour of turmoil in April 1987.
   He doesn't mention that he was paid $2,000 plus expenses by the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union for making that appearance.
   When he registered voters and laid the groundwork for his 1988
campaign, Jackson was on the payroll of the National Rainbow
Coalition, which he founded during his 1984 presidential bid to
promote voter education. Between 1986 and 1987, the group paid him
$18,750, Jackson's financial disclosure shows.
   At home in Chicago between his 1984 and 1988 campaigns, Jackson
was protected and chauffeured by two city police officers because
he has received many death threats. Police escort him when he
visits Washington, too.
   The anti-nuclear activists in SANE-FREEZE, a peace group, paid
his fare when he jetted to Geneva in November 1985 for his informal
meeting with Gorbachev as the Soviet leader awaited Reagan.
   ``All of Jesse's thing has been a sort of whoever-will-help, but
that's the nature of the civil rights movement,'' says Bishop H.H.
Brookins, a Jackson supporter and leader in the African Methodist
Episcopal Church. ``His whole thing is a kind of get-as-get-can.
He's not one of these guys who's got it built in.''
   Black churches across the nation always have helped underwrite
Jackson's trips abroad and his work at Chicago-based PUSH (People
United to Serve Humanity), Brookins said.
   Says Jackson: ``Their congregations are supportive of our
efforts. So if we need $8,000 or $18,000, we just indicate what we
need.''
   The Rev. Jim Holley, for instance, said he has helped Jackson
finance his foreign diplomacy.
   ``There are certain ministers that Jesse can call and ask for
$1,000 and we'll give it to him without any questions asked,'' said
Holley, pastor of Little Rock Baptist Church in Detroit. ``We have
a network. I remember when PUSH couldn't make its payroll one time.
I had three hours to raise $8,000 and I did it because of the
cause.''
   To illustrate his point, Holley said that in 1984 the Rev.
Jasper Williams of Salem Baptist Church in Atlanta regularly
donated money to help support Jackson's family while the candidate
was campaigning and not drawing a salary.
   When a trip abroad was planned, Holley said, a telephone
conference call was set up with Jackson and several ministers.
   ``All of us would say how much we can raise and ask him things
like, `Are you sure that's enough? Who do you want to take along
with you?''' Holley said.
   Jackson also has accepted the hospitality of foreign governments
to defray the costs of his hotel accomodations, food and in-country
travel during some of his trips abroad.
   In August 1986, for instance, as world attention focused on
rioting in South Africa, Jackson toured Nigeria, Angola, Botswana,
Tanzania, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and met with their
leaders.
   Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida provided an airplane,
Jackson said. His hotel accomodations, food and other expenses were
provided by the host government in each country, he added.
   Interest groups also have helped finance Jackson's diplomacy.
   In December 1986, Jackson flew to Japan where he met with Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and to South Korea where he visited
dissident leader Kim Dae-jung, who was under house arrest at the
time.
   Rev. Joseph Ahne, a Chicago pastor who helped organize the trip,
said the air fare and other expenses for Jackson and five others
were paid by a coalition of human rights groups from Japan. The
South Korean leg of the trip was paid for by that country's
National Council of Churches, Ahne said.
   ``Usually, when we go abroad we are the guests of some human
rights organization or some church or (are at) the courtesy of some
government,'' Jackson said. ``Or if we must pay, we simply target
the money for that particular trip and raise it.''

<HEAD>Bush Recruits Old Hands For Party And Campaign Posts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush, having clinched
the Republican presidential nomination, is moving quickly to fill
key campaign posts and to assert control over the party structure
for the fall election.
   Although Bush closely identifies with President Reagan on
issues, he is putting his own stamp on his campaign organization,
casting a wide net in assembling a convention and general election
team.
   And while Bush talks frequently about involving ``new people,''
many of his key choices are old political pros that date back to
earlier administrations and campaigns.
   A major casualty of Bush's reshaping of the party apparatus
appears to be GOP consultant William E. Timmons, who had been under
contract with the party for help on the 1988 convention.
   Timmons, who oversaw both the 1980 and 1984 Republican
conventions, has effectively been replaced by Frederic V. Malek, a
wealthy Washington businessman and former Nixon administration
official picked to head Bush's convention effort.
   ``We wanted to have our own guy running it,'' said a Bush
campaign official who insisted upon anonymity. The official said
Malek was chosen for his managment abilities.
   Malek is a senior Marriott Corp. executive. As a special
assistant to Nixon in 1972, Malek oversaw a program of redirecting
federal grants to reap political gain for Nixon. Dubbed the
``responsiveness program'' the scheme was roundly condemned by the
Senate Watergate committee.
   Malek was selected for the convention job even before Bush
clinched the GOP nomination last Tuesday with the Pennsylvania
primary, which raised his delegate total to over the 1,139
delegates needed at the convention in August in New Orleans.
   Political consultants Charles Black and James Lake, who played a
role early in Reagan's 1980 primary campaign but left before he won
the nomination, will be given major posts in the Bush effort,
campaign sources said.
   Lake helped out in the Reagan-Bush 1984 re-election campaign.
   Black most recently had been a senior political adviser to Rep.
Jack Kemp, who withdrew from the GOP contest in early March.
   Meanwhile, Bush deputy campaign manager Richard Bond has been
assigned to be campaign liason to the Republican National Committee.
   ```New people' means people that aren't necessarily the same
people that had the same jobs in the conventions year after year,''
said Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater. ``It doesn't have anything
to do with who they supported in earlier elections. The vice
president's an umbrella candidate.''
   Said campaign spokesman Peter Teeley: ``We're not going to bring
in a bunch of novices. We want to bring in people who know what
they're doing.''
   At the heart of the Bush campaign are six men upon whose advice
Bush relies heavily and who meet regularly to plot strategy.
   They include Atwater, a former Reagan aide who worked in the
1984 Reagan-Bush campaign; Robert Teeter, a GOP pollster who has
taken on the role of chief campaign strategist; Craig Fuller, who
runs Bush's vice presidential office; Robert Mosbacher, a wealthy
Texas oil industry executive.
   Also: Roger Ailes, a onetime media adviser to Nixon who has
prepared Bush for debates; and former Sen. Nicholas Brady of New
Jersey, an investment banker and longtime friend of the vice
president's.
   This inner circle is referred to at campaign headquarters as
``G-6,'' an apparent inside joke that draws on the parlance of
international econmics and anticipates the expected arrival to the
campaign of Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III.
   Baker, who ran Bush's 1980 campaign and oversaw the 1984
Reagan-Bush effort, is expected to come aboard this summer as the
campaign's senior adviser.
   Then the group will become ``G-7,'' the same designation given
to meetings of finance officials from the world's seven major
industrialized nations in which Baker has been an active
participant.
   When will Baker resin as treasury secretary to accept a campaign
assignment? ``Any time he's ready to,'' Atwater says.
   Bush's press secretary, Teeley, who has served with Bush off and
on for many years, is also viewed as a key campaign strategist.
Outside the campaign, Bush frequently seeks the advice of Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo.

<HEAD>CHICAGO: raise it.''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   During his 1984 presidential campaign, for instance, Jackson
raised the money for two major trips to Latin America. He traveled
to Mexico City in June 1984 and to Panama, El Salvador, Nicaragua
and Cuba the following month.
   Neither trip was paid for by Jackson's presidential campaign.
Supporters were asked instead to donate to a ``humanitarian fund''
set up by campaign attorney Edward Coaxum, Jackson said.
   Coaxum, a Cleveland attorney, didn't return repeated telephone
calls seeking further information and Jackson spokesman Watkins
said he didn't know how much the fund raised or whether it was
incorporated.
   It isn't unusual for public figures to travel abroad at someone
else's expense. Foreign governments frequently invite congressmen,
by themselves or in delegations, to visit, and absorb the costs.
Candidates sometimes use funds from their political action
committees for trips that burnish their foreign policy credentials.
   While Jackson has traveled abroad extensively, he apparently
hasn't drawn a regular salary since stepping down as the head of
PUSH in 1983 to wage his first presidential campaign, according to
his financial disclosure forms and PUSH financial records.
   From 1978 through 1980, he was paid about $50,000 a year as the
national president of PUSH. He received $54,615 in both 1981 and
1982, the last year that he drew a salary from the organization,
according to PUSH records filed with the Illinois attorney
general's office.
   In 1983, Jackson made about $115,000, according to income tax
returns that he released during his 1984 presidential campaign. Of
that 1983 income, Jackson earned $37,342 in speaking honoraria.
   Jackson has parlayed his charismatic style into a prominent
source of income on the lecture circuit since his 1984 campaign,
according to his financial disclosure statement filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
   In August 1984, he started Personalities International Inc., a
company run out of his Chicago home, to receive his speaking fees
and other income, according to his attorney, John Bustamante.
   Jackson was paid $192,090 by Personalities between January 1986
and Oct. 6, 1987, according to the candidate's financial disclosure
statement.
   Jackson also signed a one-year contract in October of that year
with Agency for the Performing Arts, a prominent Hollywood talent
agent. The company agreed to deliver Jackson $1 million in
engagements for speeches, along with television and radio
appearances as well as a newspaper column. The company's commission
was to be 10 percent.
   The agency sued Jackson in November 1986 for $10.1 million,
alleging he reneged, but the suit was settled out of court recently.
   Collecting speaking fees _ or honoraria _ is a common practice
among politicians. Senators are allowed to keep up to 40 percent of
their $89,500 salaries in honoraria. Sen. Albert Gore reported
receiving $31,950 in honoraria in 1986.
   Michael Dukakis, on the other hand, reported on his 1986 income
tax forms that his only earned income was the $85,000 he received
as governor of Massachusetts.
   Before becoming a candidate, Dukakis traveled occasionally as
governor, attending meetings with other governors and making a
foreign trade mission to China. Those trips were charged to the
state.
   Occasionally, Dukakis charged trips to his political campaign
committee, which dissolved only after his presidential committee
was established in April 1987.
   Jackson also disclosed that he has assets in bank accounts and
owns stock worth at least $347,010. The disclosure form doesn't
require candidates to list the precise value of such assets.
   One of the Jackson family's most valuable holdings apparently is
stock listed in his wife Jacqueline's name in Inner City
Broadcasting Corp., a New York firm that owns seven radio stations,
the Apollo Theater, a record company and a production firm that
syndicates the television program, ``It's Showtime At The Apollo.''
   On his disclosure form, Jackson lists the ICBC stock as worth
more than $250,000, but Percy Sutton, the company's chairman and a
long-time supporter of Jackson's work at Operation PUSH, refused to
say how much the stock would be worth if it were sold.
   Sutton contended in a telephone interview that recent news
reports quoting him as saying the stock was worth more than $1
million were inaccurate.
   ``I have no idea what it's worth,'' Sutton said. ``We haven't
sold any on the open market.''
   Sutton said the Jacksons invested with him in 1970 when he was
struggling to start ICBC and have ``let their investment ride.'' He
declined to disclose their initial investment or how many shares of
stock they now own.
   Dempsey Travis, a Chicago real estate broker, said he sold
Jackson his Chicago home in a middle-class neighborhood for $49,500
in 1970. He estimated that today the home would be worth about
$175,000.
   Watkins said Jackson paid $100,000 for his home in Washington,
but he didn't know how much he paid for the Greenville, S.C., home
that his mother lives in.

   Hundreds of pickets who massed behind
police lines as two strikebreaking ferries sailed into Dover on
Saturday are on the front line in a battle against Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's labor policies.
   Like other unions that mounted major strikes in recent years _
steelworkers, coal miners and newspaper printers _ the seamen
milling on the dockside of this English Channel port say they are
fighting for survival.
   ``You can take our money, but you can't take our minds, you
can't take our hearts,'' said Sam McCluskie, leader of the
24,400-strong National Union of Seamen, whose three-month strike
has crippled P and O European Ferries' cross-channel fleet. ``We
will stand together.''
   The rhetoric has the ring of yesteryear's battles to save jobs
and retain restrictive work practices that critics say slowed
Britain's economic recovery.
   Even as the pickets cheered McCluskie's call for unity, P and
O's strikebreaking ferries, Pride of Bruges and Pride of Kent, were
steaming toward Dover from the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
   Their crews were drawn from the 1,100 P and O ferry workers who
have returned to work on company terms. The pickets are among 720
refusing to go along with P and O's plans to trim its staff and
impose longer working hours. P and O has fired the strikers.
   The company's main rival, Sealink British Ferries, is trying to
keep its fleet in operation by invoking union-curbing legislation
passed since Mrs. Thatcher came to power in 1979.
   Sealink has asked a court to seize the National Union of
Seamen's $5.3 million in assets under a 1984 law barring sympathy
strikes. But the company has moved hesitantly because it does not
want to trigger a nationwide strike.
   Sealink's nervousness and a series of delays by P and O before
the strikebreaking ferries slipped their moorings showed that the
union still has clout.
   Moreover, ships' officers are wary of sailing with non-union
crews, and picket lines discourage potential ferry passengers.
   The Conservative government's law that makes unions liable for
damages over sympathy strikes is the one that helped crack
prolonged and often violent stoppages by newspaper production
unions and coal miners.
   P and O Chairman Sir Jeffrey Sterling says the company must slim
down and relax work practices or be killed by competition from the
Channel Tunnel between England and France, scheduled to open in
1993.
   McCluskie and his strikers also see the battle in apocalyptic
terms.
   ``When I joined the Queen Mary as a cabin boy, I thought I had a
job for life,'' said a 38-year-old seaman who identified himself
only as Arthur for fear of losing his job.
   ``If we lose this,'' he said, ``that's the end of jobs for
British seamen.''
   For the seamen's union, the strike is the bitter fruit of
industrial decline. Britain's once-mighty shipbuilding industry has
collapsed, and many British shipowners have switched to flags of
convenience and hired foreign crews to cut labor costs, as have
shipowners in other industrialized countries.
   Its membership having fallen from 150,000 in the 1950s to below
25,000 today, the National Union of Seamen sees the cross-channel
ferries as its lifeblood.

   Members of a U.N. team flew to Kabul
on Saturday to begin preparations for monitoring the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Maj. General Rauli Helminen of Finland is heading the nine
member U.N. Implementation Assistance Group, which was established
under a memo of understanding signed at Geneva on April 14.
   Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States and the Soviet Union
signed the memo and an agreement to end nine years of Soviet
military involvement in Afghanistan.
   The group arrived in Pakistan on Monday to discuss its task and
to establish an office in Islamabad, the capital. It will establish
a similar office in Kabul, where it will have talks with Afghan
officials.
   During its stay in Islamabad, the group met with senior
officials of the ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, and States
and Frontier Regions.
   ``We have assured the group our fullest cooperation in the
discharge of its functions,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under government rules, said
Pakistan hopes that the group ``will prove useful in bringing about
peace, ensure an orderly withdrawal of the Soviet troops and return
of nearly 5 million Afghan refugees to their homeland from Pakistan
and Iran.''
   Before the departure for Kabul, a spokesman for the U.N. group
said the meetings in Pakistan had been constructive.
   About 115,000 Soviet troops are in Afghanistan, aiding the
communist government in Kabul in its fight against anti-communist
guerrillas.
   Helminen will work as deputy to Diego Cordovez, the U.N. under
secretary- general, who brokered the Geneva peace package.
   The Finnish general will lead a group of about 50 others.

<HEAD>Seoul To Consider Contributing To Defense Cost In Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf-US, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea will consider any U.S.
request to contribute to the cost of protecting shipping lanes in
the Persian Gulf, a top Foreign Ministry official said Saturday.
   The official said the United Sates is expected to make the
request when U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense William H. Taft
visits Seoul on May 10-11.
   ``If the United States makes a formal request, we will study
it,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Korean newspapers reported from Washington that the United
States will ask South Korea to help defense efforts in the Persian
Gulf by providing $20 million worth of free maintenance to American
warships. The U.S. Navy is guarding the shipping lanes which have
become dangerous most notably because of Iranian attacks on neutral
shipping.
   Iran attacks neutral shipping in retaliation for Iraqi strikes
on Iranian oil industry targets. The two countries have been
fighting for 7{ years.
   The United States believes South Korea, which imports more than
half of its crude oil requirements through the Persian Gulf, is
obliged to contribute to the defense cost, the reports said.
   The ministry official denied that South Korea has received any
U.S. request. The Dong-A Ilbo, a leading South Korean newspaper,
said Washington made an informal request through U.S. military
channels a month ago.
   Dong-A, quoting unnamed Korean government sources, said the
United States is also asking South Korea to aid the Philippines as
part of efforts to step up security in the Pacific region.
   South Korea has not made any decision on the matter, it said.
   Dong-A said even if South Korea decides to accomodate the U.S.
request for contributing to the defense efforts in the Persian
Gulf, it would be in the form of ``technical assistance'' rather
than cash or sending troops or warships.
   The official said South Korea would have to be careful about the
U.S. request because ``contributing to the defense efforts in the
Persian Gulf would consequently mean our involvement in the war
between Iran and Iraq.''
   ``Since we are in a delicate position between Iran and Iraq, we
cannot accept any U.S. request in its entirety,'' the official said.
   The official said, however, that Seoul would favorably consider
another U.S. request to provide more money for the support of
43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
   South Korea currently contributes more than $100 million
annually in direct upkeep cost, in addition to $1 billion
indirectly through tax and rent exemptions for the public lands
used by the U.S. military here.
   The United States is reportedly asking South Korea to increase
the direct upkeep cost by $120 million a year.
   News reports quoted U.S. officials as saying that South Korea,
which enjoyed a record $9.78 billion trade surplus with the United
States last year, can afford to contribute more.

   Steel workers at one plant ended a one-day
strike today, but organizers said 16,000 others remained on strike
in a larger mill in Poland's severest labor unrest in six years.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told the government not to use
force to break up striking workers.
   The labor crisis, now in its sixth day, is the most serious to
confront communist authorities since they declared martial law in
December 1981 and banned the independent Solidarity labor
federation. The new strike wave began Monday, when bus and trolley
drivers won a 60 percent wage increase with an 11-hour stoppage in
the northwestern city of Bydgoszcz.
   Walesa, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, told regional
Solidarity chiefs to organize protests and work stoppages if the
government sends security forces against strikers.
   ``I am warning against the return to the policy of terror, which
is apparently supposed to defend reforms, while in reality it
defends the way of governing which has led Poland to ruin,'' he
said in a statement read Friday by an aide over the telephone from
Walesa's apartment in the northern port of Gdansk.
   Opposition sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
workers from the giant Lenin shipyards in Gdansk, textile plants in
Lodz, and workers in Szczecin and at least two other cities warned
they would stop work if force was used at the two steel mills.
   The state-run PAP news agency said about 7,000 strikers stopped
striking today and left the Stalowa Wola plant 100 miles east of
Krakow in southern Poland.
   It said there had been no negotiations between the management
and strikers.
   But Grzegorz Surdy, a Solidarity activist in Krakow, said,
``They (the management) gave in to all their financial demands.''
   They had demanded a $50 monthly pay raise, reinstatement of coal
allowances and release and reinstatement of three Solidarity
activists, detained after Solidarity's call for the strike.
   The agency said the strikers would lose pay for the time they
stopped work but mentioned no other action against them. The
plant's management on Friday threatened to fire all strikers.
   The government has been moving to stem unrest on Sunday, which
is May Day. The international Labor Day is traditionally celebrated
by the government and used by Polish workers to air their
grievances publicly.
   On Friday, police in Warsaw detained Jacek Kuron, a leading
opposition intellectual, and six other Solidarity leaders, union
spokesman Zbigniew Romaszewski said today in the capital. That
brought to at least 33 the number of opposition activists taken
into custody across Poland since Thursday.
   Also today, four labor leaders were released from government
custody.
   Joanna Onyszkiewicz, wife of Solidarity spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, said her husband and Warsaw Solidarity leader
Zbigniew Bujak were driven to Warsaw by police from Lublin and
released.
   The two were detained Thursday in Lublin, northeast of Stalowa
Wola.
   In Warsaw, two former underground Solidarity leaders were
released from prison today and taken to an airport for a flight to
Rome, but relatives said they refused to leave the country.
   Kornel Morawiecki and Andrzej Kolodziej were then driven back to
Warsaw's Rakowiecka prison. They had been released in a secret deal
between Roman Catholic and communist authorities, the relatives
said.
   In the southern city of Krakow, transport workers failed to heed
a Solidarity call for a strike today to support stoppages for more
pay and union rights by workers who had occupied the two steel
mills _ one in the Krakow suburb of Nowa Huta; the smaller one in
Stalowa Wola, 100 miles to the east.
   Romaszewski said transport workers had postponed plans for a
strike today in Plock, an important petrochemical center in central
Poland.
   Solidarity spokesman Grzegorz Surdyk in Krakow said one shift of
the 5,000-worker steel mill in Bochnia, just east of Krakow, staged
a brief strike Friday but later suspended their action. He said
they would resume the stoppage Monday if the Nowa Huta strike is
not settled.
   Prices have risen 42 percent so far this year because the
government reduced subsidies on many consumer items as part of a
program to make the sagging economy more market-oriented.
   Labor Minister Ireneneusz Sekula said Friday the government
would soon announce tax law changes and other measures that would
allow enterprises to meet growing worker pressure for higher pay.
He gave no details.
   Three times in postwar Poland _ in 1956, 1970 and 1980 _
widespread labor unrest has caused government shakeups.
   Strikers in Nowa Huta are demanding an immediate 50 percent
increase in their average monthly pay of $105 and a doubling of the
$15 paid monthly in compensation for recent price increases to all
industrial workers, teachers, health care workers and retirees.
   Plant deputy director Janusz Razowski told state-run radio today
that the strikers' demands for more pay were impossible to meet:
``We cannot allow the steelworks to become insolvent.''

   Dhaka police have launched a search for
smuggling rings suspected of luring young Bangladeshi women into
foreign prostitution, police sources said Saturday.
   The sources said more than 50 women, most under the age of 30,
were reported missing by their families in the last two months.
Most were believed to have been taken abroad as prostitutes, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Some of the women came to Dhaka for jobs in factories or as
maids, the sources said. Salaries are low, and some of the women
may have sought better-paying work abroad, they said.
   The government is considering introducing legislation that would
provide a death sentence for people convicted of human trafficking.
The current maximum penalty is five years in jail.

<HEAD>Consumer Group Calls for McDonald's Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer action group has
called for a boycott of McDonald's restaurants in West Germany to
protest what it considers the negative effect of fast food on
society and the environment.
   The boycott is being mounted by the Volksmund Information
Bureau, which promotes a variety of local, grass-roots initiatives
in West Germany.
   Oliver Weilandt, a Volksmund spokesman, said Saturday the group
called the boycott because it is concerned about the effects of the
fast-food chain's ``vigorous marketing efforts directed at
children.''
   Weilandt said the group also wants to boycott McDonald's ``to
call attention to a worldwide industrialization of the food
industry that is having catastrophic results on the environment and
on agriculture.''
   Officials of the giant U.S food concern say they plan no action
against the group, but many franchise owners are upset because the
group receives money from the Protestant Church in West Germany.
   ``We are not looking for a fight with the church at all,''
McDonald's marketing supervisor Rolf Kreiner was quoted by the
Protestant Press Service as saying.
   Earlier this month, several McDonald's franchise owners
threatened to stop paying church taxes because of the Protestant
Church's support for Volksmund.
   Kreiner said McDonald's understood the anger of some of its
franchise owners but would not undertake any action against the
church, according to the Protestant Press Service report, which
appeared in the Frankfurt Rundschau daily on Friday.
   The Volksmund group says fast food is unhealthy and that it
worsens local litter problems. The group also charges that
McDonald's forces employees to work part-time to avoid paying them
benefits.
   ``We are targeting McDonald's because it has perfected these
worldwide strategies,'' Weilandt said.
   Officials at the Duesseldorf-based headquarters for McDonald's
in West Germany could not be reached for comment Saturday.
   There are about 262 McDonald's restaurants in West Germany.

<TEXT>
   A one-time stripper and star attraction of Jack
Ruby's infamous Carousel nightclub will be ordained Sunday and says
she hopes to work as a jail chaplain, counseling prostitutes,
alcoholics and drug addicts.
   ``I think that's where there's so much sadness and hurt. And
nobody knows the pain unless you go through it,'' Bobbie Lou
Meserole said.
   At 13, she said, she dreamed of becoming a nun named Sister
Louise. Instead, she became a stripper named Shari Angel.
   She will become the Rev. Bobbie Lou Meserole in an ordination
service Sunday at the interdenominational Eagle's Nest Cathedral.
   As a teen-ager, she dropped out of the prestigious Ursuline
Academy. She was a stripper by the time she was 22 and a prostitute
by 30.
   She was working at the Carousel in 1963 when Ruby shot Lee
Harvey Oswald on national television. But by that time she had
started drinking heavily and she doesn't remember many of the
events surrounding the slaying of the man who killed President John
Kennedy.
   ``It was like a dream phase,'' she said.
   And along the way she was married five times and attempted
suicide several times.
   Four years ago, at 50, while being treated for alcoholism in an
Arlington hospital, she said, a compassionate psychiatrist pointed
her in the right direction. She started attending Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings and got religion.
   ``I'm completely delivered now from everything,'' she told the
Dallas Times Herald. ``I'm so full of joy and thankful to heaven. I
just feel like I could hang the moon today.''
   Ms. Meserole left Ursuline Academy to work as a drugstore clerk
and cocktail waitress to help support her 10 brothers and sisters.
Her parents were divorced and her stepfather didn't have a job.
   Club owners persuaded her to become a stripper, earning $250 to
$500 a week.
   ``I was good. I'm not bragging, but I was good and clean and
honest and the women liked me, too. When the women like you, it's
OK for their husbands to like you,'' said Ms. Meserole.
   But when the men liked you, it was easy to slip into
prostitution, she said. She did that to put food on her family's
table after her mother died. Her income increased to $1,000 to
$2,000 a week.
   ``When you have to feed people, you don't have much choice,''
she said.
   When she turned 40, the dream had become a nightmare, she said.
She quit stripping and prostitution and ``just stayed drunk for 10
years,'' she added.
   When she got out of the hospital, she met the Rev. W.V. Grant,
pastor at the Eagle's Nest Cathedral, and enrolled in classes to
become a minister.
   She now works for a housekeeping agency, cleaning two houses a
day and making about $400 a week.
   People who knew her in the past can't believe she's the same
woman.
   ``My old friends think I'm square now. Square and broke,'' she
said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bishop Eugene A. Marino, about to become the
first black archbishop of the Roman Catholic Church in America,
returns this week to a South he believes has ``come of age'' since
he left his native Mississippi 36 years ago bearing childhood
wounds of racial prejudice.
   The 53-year-old Marino, an auxiliary bishop in the Washington,
D.C., archdiocese since 1974, will be installed Thursday as
archbishop of Atlanta, taking charge of a 69-county region of
northern Georgia.
   Marino recalls a childhood in Biloxi, Miss., in which, for
example, he and his sister were kicked out of a coin-operated
laundry because they were black. But he said in a recent interview
feels ``personally very comfortable'' about returning to the South.
   ``I think that the South has changed and come of age and
grown,'' he said. ``In many ways, the race question has been more
effectively addressed in much of the South than it has been in the
North.
   ``I think I will be able as a black person to function better in
a Southern situation, as a Southerner, than I might be able to
function in some Northern situation,'' he said.
   Marino's appointment by Pope John Paul II in March came more
than two years after he and other black bishops wrote a pastoral
letter calling on the church to increase the number of blacks in
official positions.
   One of only 12 black bishops in the United States, Marino became
the first to hold an office in the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops when he was elected secretary of the organization in 1985.
   But despite his role as a trailblazer for blacks in the U.S.
Catholic church, and despite Atlanta's long tradition in the civil
rights movement, Marino said he does not necessarily see himself
becoming a leader in that struggle.
   ``I certainly am open to any position that presents itself to
me,'' he said. ``But I don't think leaders go out and become
leaders. I think the situation and the need on one hand, and
opportunities and character and ability on the other, come together
and that's what produces a leader.''
   Still, Marino said he's ``delighted and honored and thrilled''
to be moving to a city ``with a magnificant legacy and such a
beautiful tradition of leadership in this movement.''
   Marino will succeed Archbishop Thomas A. Donnellan, who died
Oct. 15. He said he plans to spend his first year traveling around
the 21,445 square miles of the Atlanta archdiocese, which has a
Catholic population of 156,000 out of a total population of 3.7
million.
   Marino said Catholics in the Atlanta archdiocese should not
expect ``anything tremendously new or different'' under his
leadership. He said his most immediate goal will be to identify the
poor in the area and ``call the people of the church to a greater
awareness of the presence of the poor.''
   As the sixth of eight children growing up in a traditional
Catholic family, Marino attended elementary and high school at Our
Mother of Sorrows Parish in Biloxi and decided at an early age to
become a priest.
   In 1952, at age 18, he entered the Josephites, an order founded
in 1893 to minister to blacks. After four years at St. Joseph's
Minor Seminary in Newburgh, N.Y., he completed his studies for the
priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary in Washington, D.C., and was
ordained a priest in 1962.
   He taught science and religion at the minor seminary in
Newburgh, then received his Master of Arts degree in religious
education from Fordham University in 1967. He was named spiritual
director of St. Joseph's Seminary in Washington in 1968 and three
years later was elected vicar general of the Josephites.
   During his 14 years as an auxiliary biship in Washington, Marino
was known as an advocate for the poor, the imprisoned and the
homeless, frequently serving as their spokesmen before Congress and
the Washington City Council.
   ``I think that one of the principal demands that Jesus places on
the church and upon those who are the ministers of the churches is
to reach out to the poor and the homeless, to those who are without
shelter,'' he said.
   Marino said he also intends to bring the message that ``we must
be a welcoming church, we must be an evangelizing church,''
particularly to blacks who make up less than 3 percent of the
American Catholic Church.
   ``We are not looking to draw people away from their own
churches,'' he said, ``but we certainly want to invite people who
have no religious affiliation to come and see what it is that we
have.''

   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II was far
from her country Saturday to open an exposition marking Australia's
bicentennial, but in a way she was right in her own land.
   She was in Queensland, Australia's tropical, northernmost state,
to open World Expo '88, which is expected to attract more than 7
million visitors by the end of October.
   ``I am told you like to call your state the Sunshine State,''
the queen told an invitation-only audience of 10,000. ``But I
prefer to think of it by its original name _ queen's land.''
   The queen has been touring Australia's outback for three weeks.
This is her 11th visit to the country, which is holding a yearlong
celebration to mark the 200 years since the first European settlers
arrived.
   The $460-million Expo '88, with its theme of ``Leisure In The
Age Of Technology,'' has attracted exhibits from 36 countries.

   Two-time Nobel-winner Linus Pauling told
a group of fifth-graders about chemical bonds in molecules and his
Nobel Peace Prize, and he also got some laughs from the youngsters.
   Pauling was in town Friday to speak at the annual awards program
at the Science Museum of Minnesota. But in the morning, he spent
some time with 10- and 11-year-olds in a special session at the
museum.
   ``What was your greatest achievement?'' one boy asked.
   In a roundabout answer that touched on his attempts to uncover
the nature of bonds in molecules, Pauling said the 1962 Nobel Peace
Prize was his greatest achievement.
   ``I was working to stop atmospheric testing of nuclear
weapons,'' he said. The students laughed when he added: ``My wife
thought it was my duty to do it.''
   Pauling said his work in chemistry, which brought a 1954 Nobel
Prize, was also rewarding.
   ``Whenever I think I know something new about the nature of the
world, I feel pretty pleased. I'm especially pleased if I make the
discovery,'' he said. The children laughed at that, too.
   Pauling, 87, had some trouble hearing the soft-spoken students.
``People begin talking in lower and lower voices as I get older,''
he said.

   Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert gave ``thumbs
down'' to ``Biloxi Blues,'' so producer Ray Stark is giving the two
TV film critics his own bad review.
   Stark said he had watched the two Chicago-based critics talk
about his film on their syndicated television show, ``Siskel and
Ebert at the Movies,'' and the two had each expressed ``shock''
that the movie wasn't better.
   ``For such men of the world, the two of you shock very easily,''
said Stark in a three-page letter to Siskel in which he described
the two as the ``critical version of Laurel and Hardy.'' He
suggested they should instead be shocked by problems such as AIDS
and homelessness.
   ``Biloxi Blues,'' the movie version of Neil Simon's play about a
Brooklyn boy in the Army, stars Matthew Broderick and was directed
by Mike Nichols. Stark is the head of Rastar Productions, which
produced the movie.

   Mayor Richard Caliguiri, who is suffering from
a rare and usually fatal disease, will be evaluated to determine
whether he is a candidate for a heart transplant, his doctor said.
   Dr. James O'Toole, the mayor's cardiologist, said a transplant
is not imminent, but he wants surgeons to see whether the operation
is viable as ``an ace in the hole'' if the mayor's condition
worsens.
   Caliguiri, 56, said that if a transplant is eventually
warranted, ``I'd be crazy not to take it.''
   O'Toole stressed that a transplant would not eliminate the
problem with amyloidosis, but it may extend the mayor's life by as
much as five to 10 years. The incurable disease, which causes
deposits of a protein substance to form in tissues and organs,
would most likely attack the new heart over time, he said.
   Caliguiri was elected in 1977 and is serving his third four-year
term. He has said he will announce by the end of the year whether
he will seek re-election in 1989.

<HEAD>Machinists Leader Dug In Against Management</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo,
irresistible cost-cutting force of the airline industry, has
smacked into a seemingly immovable object at Eastern Airlines _
veteran Machinists leader Charles E. Bryan.
   Bryan, a philosopher-mechanic who admits to being ``kind of a
cornball sometimes,'' bases his strategies on his self-education in
yoga, Zen, the Bible and history.
   ``It's kind of a Gandhi approach, or Martin Luther King. If you
continue to be right, it's pretty hard for your adversary to
overcome,'' Bryan said in a recent interview.
   But although Bryan quotes Khalil Gibran and gets misty-eyed over
the selfless nobility of King Arthur and Sir Lancelot in
``Camelot,'' his favorite movie, passive resistance is not his only
tactic.
   President of Machinists District 100 since 1979, Bryan
represents 12,000, or more than one-third, of Eastern's employees.
He has been blamed by former Eastern chairman Frank Borman for
forcing the 1986 sale of the troubled carrier to Houston-based
Texas Air.
   On April 13, Borman, vice chairman of Texas Air, appeared with
Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes at a news conference aimed
at countering a growing image that Texas Air management is
harassing employees and running unsafe airlines.
   ``The intransigence and unresponsiveness of the IAM are the most
serious obstacles to a successful conclusion of Eastern's internal
restructuring,'' Borman told reporters, citing his own experience
of trying to work with the Machinists leadership.
   Bryan responded: ``I would be delighted to sit down with Frank
Lorenzo and have an open discussion with the whole world watching.
He can bring Borman along. I don't think he'll ever have the
courage to do that. He couldn't deal with reality and the facts.''
   Lorenzo's takeover of Eastern, which teetered near bankruptcy,
chilled many employees. Lorenzo has become a bogeyman for airline
unions, a reputation solidified in 1983 when he took his
Continental Airlines into bankruptcy reorganization. He voided
contracts, slashed salaries, laid off a third of the work force and
got the carrier flying again despite a pilots' strike.
   Bryan, 55, sent Lorenzo a congratulatory telegram after he took
over Eastern and asked for a meeting. He never got a response, he
said.
   Instead, Bryan and flight attendants union head Robert V.
Callahan lost their seats on the board of directors. He later
received a letter threatening to fire him for meeting with union
members on company property.
   Bryan had frequent meetings with Borman during the former
astronaut's 15 years at Eastern, but he says he's never heard a
word from Lorenzo and has gotten no more than ``a cold-fish
handshake'' from Bakes.
   His letters to top executives, he says, are invariably answered
by staffers.
   ``They've tried to diminish me to the lowest common
denominator,'' Bryan said. ``But if there's anything that's driven
our union together, it's the way they've tried to discredit me
personally.''
   Bryan believes management, after failing to extract cuts of up
to 50 percent in salaries for baggage handlers and other
non-mechanics in his union, wanted to force a strike, keep the
carrier flying with replacement workers and crush the union.
   He claims rising numbers of firings and grievances have been
designed to ``provoke a wildcat strike so they can fire everybody.''
   ``But everyone has been beautiful in following our philosophy,
our direction to keep doing a good job and not react to the harsh
treatment,'' said Bryan, re-elected last year with 82 percent of
the vote.
   The machinists have been working since Dec. 31, 1987, under
their old contract while they meet with Eastern under the
supervision of a federal mediator. Pay and work rules are the two
main issues in the bargaining.
   There's been more to the machinists' effort than passive
resistance.
   The union has attorneys in Miami, Palm Beach, New York and
Washington keeping up with myriad lawsuits, including a recent
machinists' suit that charged management with trying to dismantle
Eastern and violating security and federal labor laws, and asked a
judge to reverse Lorenzo's takeover.
   Last year, the machinists won a federal ruling preventing
Eastern from having an outside company take over some ground
service work, and in March, another ruling blocked the announced
spin-off of Eastern's profitable Northeast shuttle into a Texas Air
subsidiary.
   And persistent charges by Eastern's pilots and machinists were
blamed by management for the current Federal Aviation
Administration safety inspections of Eastern and Continental and
for the Transportation Department's unusual study of Texas Air's
ability to run airlines.
   ``Frank Lorenzo has run into a smart cookie,'' said Callahan,
who left Eastern after losing a re-election bid in the flight
attendants union. ``Charlie Bryan is not a wild man _ he's a very
deliberate, intelligent, motivated man who has been carefully
portrayed otherwise by corporations fearful of his populist
appeal.''
   Bryan, a divorced father of three who says he last vacationed 10
years ago, is dedicating his 70-hour weeks _ at $63,879 a year _
these days to heading off Lorenzo every place he can.
   Bryan says he wants only what's best for his members and the
airline, and believes employees should have important influence in
their companies.
   ``A lot of people identify me with Don Quixote,'' Bryan said.
``But I never believe any of these dreams is impossible.''

<HEAD>Private Relief Agency Negotiating For Permanent Aid Mission To
Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY GOTTLIEB</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private relief agency says it is negotiating
with Vietnam to send the first permanent American aid mission to
the country since the 1975 defeat of U.S.-backed forces in
Indochina.
   World Vision, a California-based agency with projects in 80
nations, asked leaders in Hanoi for permission to open an operation
that eventually could funnel up to $400,000 worth of assistance to
Danang Province, World Vision president Robert Seiple said in an
interview over the weekend.
   Seiple said he was encouraged by some officials' responses
during talks in Hanoi two weeks ago, but he cautioned that further
discussions were needed with the Vietnamese, whom he called ``tough
negotiators.''
   Since the fall of South Vietnam 13 years ago, Vietnam has
received an estimated $10 million in assistance from private
American groups. But because Americans are prohibited from trading
with Vietnam, humanitarian shipments must be specially licensed by
the Commerce Department.
   So far, the shipments have been small supplies of food and
medical equipment arranged by delegations that visit the country
for a few days.
   World Vision, for example, expects to ship $40,000 worth of
resins, leather and other raw materials for prosthetic devices for
the estimated 60,000 amputees in the country. Seiple said his
agency could do much more if it had a presence in Vietnam.
   ``They're reluctant to have anybody (U.S. relief workers) in the
country permanently,'' Seiple said. ``The stance is `you give us
the money and we'll do the work.'''
   Unless that attitude changes however, the relief shipments will
remain small, though Vietnam needs massive assistance because of
its moribund economy, Seiple said.
   ``Vietnam won the war but is losing the peace,'' he said.
   World Vision would like to provide up to $400,000 in aid to the
1.6 million people in Danang, a particularly deprived province in
central Vietnam and the site of major U.S. military operations
during the war. Seiple himself was based there as a Marine pilot
flying combat missions during the war.
   ``It may not sound like a lot of money in Washington, but the
U.S. dollar goes very, very far in Vietnam's economy,'' Seiple said.
   The mission, staffed by at least one World Vision worker, would
assist the Vietnamese to improve health care, farming, literacy and
water quality. The region is also hard hit by polio, which thrives
in Vietnam because vaccination programs are limited.
   The Mennonite Central Committee and a consortium of European
private agencies also want to establish a regular presence in
Vietnam, according to the Indochina Project, a Washington group
that follows Vietnamese affairs.
   Besides Vietnamese approval for permanent missions, American
groups would need the usual U.S. government licenses. U.S.
officials also have noted that a permanent office in Hanoi might
require special waivers of laws against U.S.-Vietnamese monetary
exchange transactions.
   Humanitarian assistance received a limited U.S. government
endorsement in late 1986, when Vietnam agreed to make its best
effort to account for the estimated 1,770 Americans still listed as
missing in Vietnam since the war. In return, the United States said
it would encourage private humanitarian efforts.
   Since the agreement, Vietnam has turned over more than two dozen
remains of missing servicemen, and private relief groups have sent
raw materials for the production of artificial limbs.
   Still, the Reagan administration has said it will be cool to
further enhancement of the relationship as long as the Vietnamese
continue their occupation of neighboring Cambodia. Administration
officials have also said publicly they believe the Vietnamese are
withholding information about missing American servicemen.
   The administration has been especially critical of a proposal by
several senators that the two countries open diplomatic missions in
each others' capitals along the lines of the ``interest sections''
the United States and Cuba have.
   Seiple and other humanitarian aid workers support the proposal.
   ``It would be a positive step,'' Seiple said. ``You can't fight
a match outside the ring. Not only would it help in the
humanitarian efforts, it would probably help resolve the issue of
the missing.''
   ``The war is over for both sides, now is the time for peace, for
reconciliation, for healing,'' Seiple said.

   Police said Saturday they smashed a

hidden inside beef carcasses delivered to butchers.
   Police said eight people, mostly butchers, were in custody and
that three other people were sought. All are charged with
possession and sale of cocaine and hashish.
   The arrests came after an almost yearlong investigation, police
said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the ring had sold narcotics
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   Police said the drugs were hidden in nylon bags stuffed inside
beef carcasses that were delivered in refrigerated trucks to
Cagliari, on the southern coast of the island of Sardinia.

   Customs officials seized a truckload of
27 works of art worth $440,000, including paintings by Van Gogh, at
a highway rest stop, officials said Saturday.
   The drawings, watercolors and oil paintings were being
transported through France without proper authorization from London
to Lugano, Switzerland, in an Italian moving van, customs officials
said.
   They said the art was seized after a routine police check April
7 at a rest area near Bethune, about 130 miles north of Paris.
   Police said the works apparently were bought recently at
auctions in London. They include the Vincent Van Gogh oil painting
``Small Farm,'' appraised at $155,000, and two works by Maurice
Utrillo.
   Authorities refused to identify the owner. They said an
investigation was under way to determine why they were being
transported without the necessary documentation. The truck driver
was not charged.

   Taiwanese warships fired at two Chinese fishing
vessels trading illegally with Taiwanese in separate incidents, an
official report from China said. Five fishermen were reported
injured.
   The China News Service said in a report appearing in Hong Kong
on Saturday that a fishing boat from Pingtan County in coastal
Fujian province was chased by three navy ships near Taiwan's
northern port of Keelung on April 16.
   The warships fired from about 200 yards away, and three Chinese
fishermen were injured, the report said.
   Two other fishermen were injured April 17 when their Fujian
vessel was fired upon after trading with Taiwanese, the report said.
   All five fishermen were hospitalized in Fujian, it said. It did
not mention damage to the fishing boats.
   Taiwan's Nationalist government fled to the island in 1949 after
losing a civil war to the communists on the mainland. It has
refused all official contact with the Beijing government.
   Direct business ties are forbidden, but Chinese and Taiwanese
fishermen reportedly have a thriving trade in the Taiwan Straits
separating the mainland from the island.
   In Taipei, military and government officials were not
immediately available for comment during the weekend holiday.
   But the Defense Ministry has warned repeatedly that Taiwanese
warships would fire at mainland Chinese fishing boats if they
ignore warnings not to approach Taiwan's coast to trade with local
fishermen.
   Officials have said the military has intensified coastal patrols
in recent months because Chinese fishing boats have ``harassed''
local fishing boats since Taiwan lifted martial law last July.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan said today he would issue a
fast veto of the trade bill and urged Congress to pass one that
``will assist, not impede, our dynamic economy.''
   In a weekly radio address delivered from the Oval Office, Reagan
said his objections to the bill ``range from rules on plant closing
notifications to restrictions on exports.''
   ``You can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto, but
fast,'' the president said, adding that he would then propose an
alternative measure.
   The president said the trade bill originally proposed in
Congress contained many provisions to which the administration
objected.
   ``Working with members of Congress, we managed to remove almost
all of these bad provisions,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, however
when it comes to safeguarding property, almost can never be good
enough.''
   ``The current legislation, despite all the hard work, still has
provisions that threaten economic growth,'' the president said.
``These provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unnecessary,
burdensome and costly regulation of private industry.''
   He said all Congress ``has to do is drop the ruffles, frills and
flourishes put there for the special interests, and we can have a
trade bill, and have it soon.''
   ``I urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action
on a bill immediately after my veto is sustained,'' the president
said. ``It is time to set aside the special interests and advance
America's interests by passing trade legislation that will assist,
not impede, our dynamic economy.''

   In the Democratic response to the president's address, Rep. Don
J. Pease, D-Ohio, a member of the House Ways and Means subcommittee
on trade, said Reagan ``will make a foolish mistake if he vetoes
the bill.''
   ``Members of Congress get 60 days notice when they lose their
job; so does the president of the United States,'' said Pease.
``Why shouldn't ordinary citizens? Even President Reagan's own Task
Force and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce say that advance notice is
good business practice.''

   The 1,000-page bill, fashioned over three years of congressional
debate, won 63-36 approval Thursday in the Senate _ three votes
short of the margin needed to overturn a presidential veto. Because
of the measure's length, clerical work and printing are expected to
delay its delivery to the president until midweek at the earliest.
   The bill would overhaul the nation's system for imposing import
curbs to retaliate against international trade violations and aid
American industries threatened by stepped-up foreign competition.
   An section added to the bill requires all but the smallest
employers to provide 60-day notice of plant closings and
large-scale layoffs. There are exceptions for companies that find
themselves in serious financial trouble.
   The administration opposes the provision, saying it does not
belong in the trade bill and would cramp U.S. economic growth and
encourage companies to locate elsewhere by adding new federal
regulation. Supporters argue that the idea is humane and decent.
   At the White House, a senior administration official said Friday
that Reagan's veto message is expected to cover at least plant
closings and the bill's curbs on Alaska oil exports.
   ``It won't be a laundry list of items but we want to give
Capitol Hill a clear idea of what the president will accept in a
second bill,'' the official said. He said Cabinet officers were
being consulted about their objections.

   The deaths of two U.S. helicopter pilots
raises to 46 the number of Americans killed during the past year in
the Persian Gulf region.
   The figure includes 37 who died in an Iraqi missile strike on
the U.S. frigate Stark on May 17, 1987. Iraq said the attack was a
mistake.
   The Navy has 17 ships in the gulf, including six mine sweepers,
and 10 others in nearby waters. The effort, prompted by attacks on
merchant vessels during the 7{-year war between Iraq and Iran,
costs $1 million a day.
   The Pentagon announced in Washington on Friday that the two
crewmen aboard a U.S. Marine Corps AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship
had been officially declared killed in action. They had been listed
as missing since April 18.
   The Marine Corps announcement said the crew reported an enemy
radar locked on their helicopter before it disappeared. However,
the statement did not say the craft was shot down by Iranian
forces, as Iran claimed.
   Its crew was identified as Capt. Stephen C. Leslie, 30, of New
Bern, N.C., and Capt. Kenneth W. Hill, 33, of Thomasville, N.C.
   Their helicopter disappeared when the United States attacked and
destroyed two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for Iranian
mining of gulf waters and firing at American helicopters. When Iran
countered later that day, U.S. forces sunk or disabled six Iranian
vessels.
   Tehran's official Islamic News Agency said 44 Iranian sailors
were killed. It also claimed 15 U.S. Marines were wounded, which
U.S. military spokesmen denied.
   The helicopter, which took part in the attack on one of the
Iranian oil platforms earlier in the day, vanished during a
nighttime mission off the guided missile cruiser Wainwright a few
hours after the fighting ended.
   Iran claimed it had shot down the helicopter and recovered the
wreckage. However, none was publicly displayed.
   Seven other U.S. deaths in the region came as a result of flying
accidents. Four soldiers were killed when a Navy SH-3G courier
helicopter crashed into the Middle East Force flagship La Salle
while attempting a landing on July 30.
   A Marine pilot was killed Oct. 5 when his UH-1 helicopter
crashed in the central gulf.
   On Sept. 18, two Navy fliers were lost in the crash of an A-6E
Intruder fighter-bomber off an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.

   A small earthquake shook the hills near the pope's
summer residence south of Rome on Saturday and was felt in the
capital, but there were no reports of injury or damage.
   The National Institute of Geophysics said the quake measured
between 4 and 5 on the Mercalli scale and that the epicenter was in
the Castelli Romani region, a group of hill towns about 16 miles
south of Rome.
   Castel Gandolfo, the summer residence of the pope, is in the
area.
   The Department of Civil Protection said there were no reports of
injury or damage.
   The Mercalli scale gauges the intensity of an earthquake as felt
in a specific location. The scale runs from 1 to 12. A reading of 1
means the quake is only felt by a few people, and a reading of 12
indicates a major quake.

   The government imposed a nighttime
curfew in southeastern Bangladesh after the slayings of 21 Moslems
believed killed by Buddhist rebels, officials said Saturday.
   Troops were put on alert in Khagrachari district, about 150
miles southeast of Dhaka. Officials there said reinforcements were
added to protect the border from incursions by rebels entering
Bangladesh from India.
   The curfew in the district is in effect from dusk to dawn, said
the officials, who were contacted by telephone and spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The crackdown was ordered after 21 people, most of them Moslem
settlers, were slain during attacks blamed on members of the
Buddhist Chakma tribe.
   The tribal rebels contend that the government's settlement
policy is robbing them of their traditional lands.
   The rebels have been fighting the government for 14 years. An
estimated 4,000 people have died in rebel attacks and government
reprisals, and nearly 50,000 Chakma tribals have fled to India
during the conflict.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's weekly
radio address, as delivered Saturday from the White House:
   This week in Washington, trade was the talk of the town, and
important talk it was. I've often mentioned trade issues in these
broadcasts, and with your help during these last few years, we've
been able to resist attempts to block free and fair trade.
   It hasn't been easy, because not a few politicians still think
the way to re-election is to portray themselves as the great friend
of the American worker by pushing protectionism. It's been up to us
to point out that over the long run, this approach halts growth and
costs jobs. But, as I say, with your help, this message has gotten
through.
   Believe me, this ability to resist protectionism along with our
commitment to lower taxes, less spending and fewer regulations, has
made a huge difference in all of our lives. I don't think any of us
can easily forget that sense of desperation Americans felt a few
years ago as they saw inflation driving the weekly grocery bill up
and up, the value of their savings shrinking, jobs growing
increasingly scarce and economic growth going down to virtually
nothing.
   Well, all that's been changed around. Just this week Beryl
Sprinkel, the head of my Council of Economic Advisers went down to
the White House briefing room to deliver his quarterly report on
the state of the economy. Some experts who had noted we're in the
65th month of our economic expansion were saying a slowdown was
inevitable, and others, nothing last October's stock market plunge
made dire predictions about what the economy was going to do in the
first quarter of this year.
   But the results were exactly what we had hoped for, and, in
fact, what we had predicted. The economy is moving along at a
moderate rate of growth, and inflation is well under control. My
fellow Americans, I remember only too well working in 1981 on my
first televised speech describing the ``worst economic mess since
the Great Depression,'' and wondering even then how long it would
take us to repair the damage.
   Well, thanks to the dynamics of less government and more free
markets, the damage has been repaired and repaired much faster than
anyone could have originally hoped. That's why I'm certain you
don't want me or Congress taking any risks with this progress. And
that's also why I've made it clear that I'm going to be very severe
with any trade legislation coming out of Congress that threatens
America's prosperity.
   For the last year, we've all been working on a trade bill here,
one that initially contained many objectionable provisions. Working
with members of Congress, we managed to remove almost all of these
bad provisions. Unfortunately, however, when it comes to
safeguarding prosperity, ``almost'' _ well, ``almost'' can never be
good enough. The current legislation, despite all the hard work,
still has provisions that threaten economic growth.
   These provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unecessary,
burdensome and costly regulation of private industry. Provisions
range from rules on plant closing notifications to restrictions on
exports. Unfortunately, these provisions serve the special
interests and not the nation's interest.
   They would reduce the flexibility of our economy and render us
less able to respond to the realities of the international
marketplace. In short, they would make us less competitive, not
more. This bill did pass the Congress this week. But the good news
is, the vote showed we have the strength to sustain a presidential
veto. And you can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto,
but fast. And then, all Congress has to do is drop the ruffles,
frills and flourishes put there for the special interests, and we
can have a trade bill and have it soon.
   As I've stated repeatedly, I want a trade bill and we'll work
vigorously to secure one. I urge the congressional leadership to
schedule prompt action on a bill immediately after my veto is
sustained. It is time to set aside the special interests and
advance America's interest by passing trade legislation that will
assist, not impede, our dynamic economy.
   In the meantime, I'm delighted to tell you that there was some
good news on trade this week. Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada was
in town and we discussed our two nations' pending agreement on a
historic free trade zone between the United States and Canada. This
is the kind of trade legislation we need; legislation that promotes
growth and prosperity and keeps America away from the protectionism
that once cost the world and our country so much.
   Until next week, thanks for listening, and God bless you.

<NOTE>Eds: TOPS with with 5 grafs on new FAA order restricting 737s;
picks up 2nd graf, Last October</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Federal Aviation Administration today
issued an emergency order barring older Boeing 737s like the
jetliner that ripped open over Hawaii from flying higher than
23,000 feet if they have had more than 55,000 landings.
   The order is in effect until the affected airlines conduct
complete visual inspections of the jets' first class cabin
structure, which is the area that opened at 24,000 feet in the
Aloha Airlines jet.
   FAA spokesman Fred Ferrar said the order would affect 66 planes
in the 737-100 and 737-200 series. The jets are in the fleets of
Aloha, Piedmont and American airlines, he said.
   He said that at altitudes of 23,000 feet the pressure between
the outside and inside of the aircraft is such that a structural
weakness would not cause a failure or damage to the plane.
   The order, issued as an airworthiness directive by FAA
Administrator T. Allan McArtor, is effective immediately, Ferrar
said. Airlines must complete inspections of the aircraft over the
next 500 landings.
   Last October 5, the FAA ordered close inspection of the upper
skin of the early model Boeing 737s because routine inspections had
turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap,
officials said Friday. The agency warned the problem could cause
rapid cabin decompression, they said.
   The inspections also found metal strips on the fuselage coming
loose on some early-model Boeing 737s because the lamination was no
longer holding.
   Boeing spokesman Jim Boynton said in Seattle the company has
issued service bulletins on the need for periodic inspections for
possible cracking or structural weakening because of corrosion of
the skin of the older Boeing 737s.
   Boynton said the company's most recent bulletin had been issued
two weeks before Thursday's incident in which a huge upper section
of an Aloha Airlines 737 jet tore away, leaving passengers exposed
to the open skies at 24,000 feet and forcing the pilot to make an
emergency landing within 15 minutes.
   A flight attendant was swept out of the plane to her death and
61 passengers were injured in the incident.
   The Aloha Airlines jet involved in the incident was among the
early 737 models subject to the FAA directive as well as to the
series of service bulletins by Boeing outlining the inspection
programs, officials said Friday.
   The FAA directive required operators of older Boeing 737s to
inspect the extreme upper sections of the planes' outer skin from
just behind the front entry door to the tail section for cracks and
metal strips that might be coming loose and ``could result in rapid
depressurization of the airplane.''
   The directive covered the first 291 Boeing 737s manufactured, of
which the Aloha plane was No. 152, according to Boeing.
   Investigators have not determined the cause of the Aloha
incident, but sources who asked not to be identified said that
investigators are focusing on a possible structural failure that
could have caused a rapid depressurization of the aircraft cabin.
   However, Stephanie Ackerman, manager of public relations for
Aloha, said: ``We are in full compliance with the October
directive. We did receive the directive, the inspections were
carried out and we are in compliance.''
   She would not elaborate on what the inspections revealed, but
said nothing was found that caused alarm.
   FAA records show that twice in 1983 and several other times
since then there has been extensive repair work to mend cracks and
corroded metal in the lower half of the Aloha plane. This seemed
not to be related to Thursday's incident.

   Gary Clark finished last in all nine triathlons he
entered last year, but he says he was the winner. Just living is a
victory for the 49-year-old heart-transplant recipient.
   ``I used to live for the bonus check at the end of each month,''
said the former Tuscon, Ariz., insurance executive who will compete
here Sunday in a triathlon. ``Now, the way I look at it, every day
is a bonus check.
   ``I'm not out there to win any race. But I feel that every race
I'm in I win,'' he said.
   As a successful executive, Clark worked 16 hours a day, smoked
heavily and never exercised. But that changed when he received a
heart transplant in 1985 after a yearlong bout with heart disease.
   He started walking, and four months later entered a
five-kilometer walkathon. Six weeks after that, he entered a
10-kilometer race, walking much of the way and finishing dead last.
   Triathlons _ races that combine running, swimming and bicycling
_ were his next step. He started training and in April 1986 entered
one in Tuscon.
   ``People were saying, `Hurry up, hurry up!' and I was like `I'm
moving. That's fast enough.' I was like the clown in the rodeo,''
Clark said.
   As he trained for the Sunday event, he recalled a race in
Phoenix last year. While awaiting the start, he spotted Herschel
and Brenda Tweed, parents of the teen-ager whose heart he received.
   ``I walked over and they all gave me a hug,'' said Clark. ``Then
just before the race they were yelling, `Go get 'em, Gary!' I was
actually crying, standing there before the start of the race.''

   A pair of stickup artists had it all figured out
_ guns, masks, the armored car stopped at a currency exchange. They
just got ahead of themselves, police said.
   Shortly after noon Friday, an armored car pulled up to the
Northwest Side Currency Exchange. The guard got out, walking toward
the building.
   Just then, a gun-toting, masked robber stepped out of a
passageway.
   Robber: ``This is a stickup!''
   Guard: ``I don't have any money yet. This is a pickup.''
   Felonious frustration!
   The gunman pointed his gun in the air and fired once, then took
off running with an accomplice who had been waiting nearby.
   ``It was well planned and thought out,'' said police Sgt.
William Murray. ``But they got it backwards.''

   A hundred photographers who fanned out
throughout California were attempting to capture the essence of the
Golden State in a single day.
   ``It was a fascinating idea, and still is, to capture a country
or a state in a day,'' said Seny Norasingh, one of the
photographers for the book ``A Day in the Life of California.''
   Norasingh was one of 100 photographers who took part in ther
project Friday. The book, set to be published this fall, will be
the eighth in a series of books of pictures taken in a certain
place in a single day.
   Norasingh spent his day in San Francisco's Chinatown, where
inside a Roman Catholic school surrounded by shops and restaurants,
children began with the pledge of allegiance, a prayer and a song.
   ``Almost all my pictures in the other books were something I
shot on my own,'' said Norasingh, who also worked on the books on a
day in the life in Spain, America and the Soviet Union.

   President Reagan said Saturday that he plans
to quickly veto the trade legislation passed by Congress and that
the politically touchy issue of plant closing notification will not
be the only reason for his action.
   ``You can be sure that this bill is going to get a veto but
fast,'' Reagan said in his weekly radio address, delivered from the
Oval Office.
   The president said ``almost all'' of the provisions the
administration originally objected to had been removed from the
bill during negotiations with Congress.
   ``Unfortunately, however when it comes to safeguarding
prosperity, almost can never be good enough.''
   ``The current legislation, despite all the hard work, still has
provisions that threaten economic growth,'' the president said.
``These provisions are comprised mainly of demands for unnecessary,
burdensome and costly regulation of private industry.''
   ``The provisions range from rules on plant closing notifications
to restrictions on exports.''
   Reagan's veto could come as early as midweek, and he indicated
Saturday that he expects his veto to be sustained. Although the
measure won approval by a wide margin in the House, the Senate's
63-36 vote was three votes short of the margin needed to overturn a
veto.
   ``I urge the congressional leadership to schedule prompt action
on a bill immediately after my veto is sustained,'' Reagan said.
``It is time to set aside the special interests and advance
America's interests by passing trade legislation that will assist,
not impede, our dynamic economy.''
   The plant-closings feature requires all but the smallest
employers to provide 60-day notice of closings and large-scale
layoffs. There are exceptions for companies that find themselves in
serious financial trouble.
   The administration opposes the provision, saying it would cramp
U.S. economic growth and encourage companies to locate elsewhere by
adding new federal regulation. Rep. Don Pease of Ohio, delivering
the Democratic response to the president's speech, said, ``It
merely calls for a measure of common courtesy on the part of those
companies that can afford it.''
   ``One-third of all workers get no notice; they're told to pick
up their pay checks and leave,'' Pease said. `` Two-thirds of all
workers get less than two weeks' notice. They may have put in 20
years of service and have two kids in college, but they're out on
the street _ just like that.''
   The president's comments came after one of his strongest
supporters in the Senate expressed qualms about focusing on the
plant closing provision in a presidential veto message.
   ``Frankly, some of us think there ought to be a stronger
reason,'' Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, told
reporters.
   Blaming the veto on the plant-closings provision, Dole told
reporters Thursday, ``puts Republicans on the side, at least the
perception out there, of being against the poor working men and
women who get only four-day notice.''
   He expressed doubt, when pressed, however, that the issue would
be much of a headache on the campaign trail this fall.
   The provision's supporters are just as sure that it will.
   ``It certainly gives the Democrats a huge issue for the fall
...,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``There aren't going to be many
factory workers who think it is unfair for them to get 60-day
notice before they get put out to pasture.''
   ``There are polls out there,'' says Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich. ``The American people feel that it is entirely reasonable
and sound.''
   Dole was the most candid among administration supporters. But
several GOP congressional staffers said there was growing concern
over the issue.
   The main provisions of the trade bill would overhaul the
nation's system for imposing import curbs to retaliate against
international trade violations and aid American industries
threatened by stepped-up foreign competition.

   A set of remaining ``loose ends'' is casting a
shadow on prospects for ratification of the U.S.-Soviet
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty in time for President
Reagan's summit trip to Moscow.
   The four snags cited by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., include a U.S.-Soviet disagreement about the meaning of
provisions designed to assure the United States against Soviet
cheating.
   He and the other leaders say they are optimistic all the
difficulties will be resolved, but they have firmly declared their
opposition to rushing the ratification proceedings just so the work
will be finished by the May 29-June 2 summit.
   ``This is not a delay,'' said Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. ``This is an effort to do this
thoroughly.''
   Since last December, when the superpowers signed the pact
eliminating ground-based missiles with ranges between 315 and 3,125
miles, Reagan has hailed the verification and monitoring provisions
as unprecedented sets of safeguards against Soviet non-compliance.
   Having steered the pact through committee hearings, the
administration is now eager for approval by the whole Senate in
time for a formal exchange of ratification documents between Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the summit.
   Byrd told a news conference on Friday he would open the Senate
debate on May 11, if the four obstacles are overcome. Joining Byrd
and Nunn in the decision were the chairmen of two other important
Senate committees: Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., of Foreign Relations and
David L. Boren, D-Okla., of the Select Committee on Intelligence,
who called the stumbling blocks ``important loose ends.''
   The newest of the four problems identified by Byrd is a
disagreement between the United States and the Soviet Union over
the things inspectors of missile facilities will be permitted to
see and where they may go to see them.
   According to the State Department, Soviet experts believe the
treaty permits inspection of weapons containers big enough to
contain entire missiles. They also want to put off-limits some
areas of three of their 133 facilities covered by the agreement.
   The United States says the treaty permits inspection of smaller
containers as well, to see if they contain individual missile
stages, and does not permit the Soviets to place the selected areas
off limits.
   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said higher level
officials had become involved in the dispute, which originally was
raised on a technical level, and he said he was optimistic the
problems would be resolved.
   Nunn said: ``I believe the problems can be reconciled but I
believe the Soviets should understand this is not a good way to
start out by challenging some clear provisions of the treaty.
   ``It is enormously important that we go into this treaty with
good faith on both sides. We do not need any cloud of bad faith
hanging over us.''
   The second snag, the senators said, was the need to get
clarification from the Soviets, in writing, that the ban on
intermediate range-missiles now in the superpower arsenal will
prevent both sides from developing futuristic versions of these
weapons.
   In settling this dispute, the two countries would presumably
need to define more precisely what is, in fact, a ``weapons
delivery system.'' The fear is that arms builders could devise a
weapon they do not define as a missile but has the capabilities
that today's missiles have.
   Third, the senators are seeking assurances that the United
States has the capability to verify the ban on futuristic weapons.
And finally, they want a commitment from the administration that it
is moving adequately and with enough money to upgrade satellite
surveillance systems that help monitor the accord.
   ``If these differences can be resolved, I don't see any reason
why we can't approve ratification,'' Byrd said.

<HEAD>Election Year Brings Push for Anti-Drug Legislation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's an election year, and Democratic and
Republican leaders in Congress are putting a high priority on
anti-drug legislation. But their major problem is how to fund the
battle.
   ``Both political parties are going to be scrambling to pose as
Mr. Drug Buster for the next six months,'' said Rep. David Obey,
chairman of the House subcommittee on foreign operations.
   ``There's a tendency to pose for holy pictures in election years
on drugs, and then forget about the blasted issue next time
'round,'' complained Obey, D-Wis.
   The Senate has struck first, going on record earlier this month
93-0 in favor of bypassing Congress' spending-cut promises to allow
$2.6 billion in new drug programs. Indications are that the
envisioned drug bill will be timed to hit the Senate floor in
September for maximum election impact.
   The House voted to stay within current overall spending
guidelines. But its Democratic and Republican leaders have each
ordered up their own drug bills, with public release expected in
the next few weeks.
   ``We're hoping Republicans and Democrats will join together and
we'll have a bipartisan drug bill,'' said House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas.
   Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, chairman of the Republicans' task
force, agreed. But containing the cost will make it tough, he said.
   ``There will be, for anyone, a very limited amount of
resources,'' he said. ``They are going to be meager compared to all
the ideas there are to spend them.''
   The Senate bill, introduced by Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
and Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., would provide big budget increases for
federal law enforcement agencies and grants to local police.
   About a fourth of the money would go toward efforts to reduce
demand in this country through treatment centers and drug education.
   The House bills will carry those options and more.
   Wright has asked committee chairmen to come up with a
comprehensive package. It will almost surely be more expensive than
whatever the House Republicans propose, especially in aid to local
governments and police.
   Liberals on Friday were looking at cutting military spending to
pay for it.
   An amendment was being considered for the Pentagon bill now
before the House that would cut funding for the Star Wars missile
defense system and transfer it to the anti-drug-import efforts.
   Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the third-ranking Democrat,
acknowledged the Reagan administration might consider that funding
strategy as backing away from Pentagon spending agreements made
last fall. But, he said, ``The public has their priorities the same
as we do.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., the chairman of the House select
narcotics committee, would like to also include money to fight AIDS
among drug users, and would support expanded use of the U.S.
military to help other nations control their drug production,
according to spokesman Bob Weiner.
   ``One thing we don't want is the death penalty,'' he said, or
penalties on users that would overload prisons. Weiner said
Rangel's proposal would be about the same cost as the Senate plan.
   Republicans are looking at stiffer penalties for drug offenders,
including capital punishment for dealers involved in deaths and
proposals to cut demand with emphasis on what they call ``user
accountability.'' What form that will take is still unclear, as
jail terms must be weighed against problems of prison overcrowding.
   The GOP lawmakers, who two years ago opposed creation of a drug
``czar'' to coordinate federal efforts, may now favor one. They
were also examining drug testing and related proposals to force
anti-drug action by local governments and businesses that get
federal money.
   Both the House and Senate are expressing impatience with the
cooperation of other countries.
   The Senate has voted overwhelmingly to impose sanctions against
Mexico for not doing its share to help the United States fight the
flow of drugs across the border.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee, meanwhile, has recommended
similar action against Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay.
   Neither of those pieces of legislation is expected to reach the
president's desk. But with the White House at stake this year some
sort of drug legislation including international enforcement is
expected to emerge before Congress quits in October for the
campaign trail.
   Ann B. Wrobleski, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, told Obey's subcommittee the administration was
expecting Congress to take action on drugs before the election.
   ``Drugs... is a cyclical issue,'' she told a House
appropriations subcommittee, ``When the drug bill is on the floor,
we're going to have an orgy of amendments of people out-narcing
each other.''
   Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, who is helping to draft the GOP
proposal, agreed. ``It's very clear that in the months ahead
Congress will be right in the middle of this business,'' he said.
   Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio, told the House last week that
Congress needed to take drastic action, including the death penalty
for dealers and use of the military.
   ``Too many politicians make hay with drugs around here, and the
drug dealers just keep making money,'' he said.

<HEAD>Administration Relaxes Ban on U.S. Payments In Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration Saturday relaxed its
order prohibiting Americans from paying debts in Panama, opening
the way for many U.S. workers to clear up bills for water, power
and other essential services.
   On April 8, President Reagan barred any direct or indirect
payments by Americans to the regime headed by Gen. Manuel Noriega.
The order, which included U.S. corporations, also blocked all
Panamanian assets in the United States.
   Subsequently, electrical power and other services were cut off
at the homes of some Americans, including embassy workers,
   who were prohibited from paying their bills.
   The Treasury Department's announcement Saturday specified that
Americans may now make payments for electricity, water, and similar
municipal services, and for communications including telephones and
telegrams.
   Also allowed will be travel-related payments, including
departure fees and ticket taxes, landing fees and fuel taxes.
   Individuals who have paid into Panama's social security system,
which includes health care, may continue to do so, but payments of
the country's income tax remain on the prohibited list. The payment
of sales and excise taxes will now be allowed.
   The new rules continue to require that payments for other
obligations be made into a specially designated account at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to be held ``for the benefit of
the Panamanian people.'' Those payments include corporate and
individual income taxes, port fees, import duties and corporate
social security assessments.
   The administration has been seeking Noriega's ouster since he
was indicted in early February on drug trafficking charges by two
grand juries in Florida.

   A fist-sized bundle of fluff named Molloko, the
first California condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled meals
of minced mice today.
   ``Everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the chick,''
said Martha Baker, spokeswoman for the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
``But the first 10 days are critical, for anybody, human or
animal.''
   The chick ate its first meal about 6 a.m. and took subsequent
meals from the fingertips of a keeper, Ms. Baker said.
   The food was minced baby mice and chicken egg yoke, she said.
The meals fed to the chick, which is about the size of a man's
fist, amounted to about two tablespoons of food.
   Keepers using tweezers and gloved fingertips helped the baby
bird break free of its shell at 5:38 p.m. PDT Friday ending a
61{-hour hatching process that began when the first crack appeared
in the chick's shell Wednesday.
   Molloko is an Indian word for condor, chosen by an intertribal
council of California tribes, Ms. Baker said.
   The squawking chick was swaddled in a towel and placed in the
same type of isolette used for premature infants. The dull
yellow-colored chick with its bald, peaked head, was reportedly
resting comfortably.
   ``Early this morning there were 27 California condors left in
the world,'' Bill Toone, the park's curator of birds, said at the
news conference Friday. ``This afternoon there's 28 of them, and we
couldn't be more excited about that.
   ``When the numbers are so low, one bird is seen as a very big
step away from extinction,'' he added.
   The chick was conceived by the only known active breeding pair
of the nearly extinct California condor, North America's largest
land bird.
   Efforts to save the California condor, which has a wingspan of
up to 10 feet at maturity, rest with the captive breeding program.
The last known California condor in the wild was captured a year
ago.
   The chick, whose sex won't be determined for about a month, will
grow up not knowing its mother or father. It will be raised in
captivity with the help of hand puppets that resemble condors. The
puppets are used to feed the chick.
   Officials decided to intervene in the hatching process Friday
and give the chick a delicate boost after it became mired inside
its shell.
   The bird had become stuck in a kind of ``glue'' composed of
dried membrane and albumen and couldn't rotate in the shell to peck
its way out, Hanscom said.
   Biologist Cyndi Kuehler checked the egg every two hours Friday
before determining the chick was ready to be assisted from the
shell.
   Kuehler couldn't intervene prematurely because of the danger of
rupturing blood vessels linked to egg membranes, possibly
triggering fatal bleeding at the point of the rupture, Hanscom said.
   When it was certain that the chick's external circulation
ceased, Kuehler could begin to pull away bits of the blue-green
eggshell using her gloved fingers. Tweezers were used to peel back
the shell membrane. The gradual, complicated process took seven
hours until there was room to lift the bird out.
   The avocado-sized egg, about 5 inches long, had been under a
24-hour watch since 4 a.m. Wednesday, when keepers noticed cracks
in one end. The ``pip'' cracks signaled the start of a hatching
process that took nearly three days.
   After the egg was laid March 3, it was taken away from the
parent birds and incubated artificially in hopes that the female
bird would produce a second egg. But so far, this has not happened.

   Authorities arrested more than 1,000 people
and seized hundreds of weapons in a 48-hour nationwide crackdown on
small-time drug pushers and criminals, police said Saturday.
   It was the fourth such police operation since early last year,
when the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
decided to stiffen penalties for drug dealers and try to eliminate
drug-peddling areas in the country's major cities.
   Spain has become a major point of entry into Europe for Latin
American cocaine and Middle Eastern and southeast Asian heroin,
international drug enforcement officials say.
   Authorities said they arrested 1,038 suspects in the raids and
seized three pounds each of heroin and cocaine, 275 pounds of
hashish and 1,500 pills of hallucinogenic drugs.
   Officers also confiscated 35 guns, 479 knives and nearly
$270,000.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response
given Saturday by Rep. Don J. Pease, D-Ohio, to President Reagan's
radio address:
   President Reagan ought to sign the trade bill. He will make a
foolish mistake if he vetoes the bill. It will be a foolish mistake
because the United States is on the threshold of a new economic
era. To preserve our standard of living in the 1990s, we must do
better, much better, in the game of global trade.
   The American people understand this. That's why the trade bill
passed the Congress by a large bipartisan majority.
   The bill recognizes that we need to do two things above all: we
must launch an export campaign unprecedented in our history; and we
must improve our productivity.
   The bill plots a strategy for increasing exports. First, it
liberates firms from the red tape of unduly tight export controls.
Second, it boosts export promotion efforts to benefit American
companies. Third, it blows the whistle on unequal and unfair trade.
Many countries have gotten rich off of free access to the U.S.
market while protecting their home markets. These countries can now
afford to eliminate their trade barriers. The bill requires them to
live up to their international obligations _ pure and simple. We
seek a level playing field.
   But it takes more than a level playing field to compete. You've
got to have skilled employees. And a sure way to boost labor
productivity is to strengthen education and training.
   The trade bill would entitle all workers who lose their jobs to
imports to training or remedial education. It provides nearly a
billion dollars for the readjustment of other workers. And it
renews the nation's commitment to math, science, foreign language
and vocational education.
   In addition, the bill requires large, financially sound
companies to give their employees and communities 60 days notice of
plant closings or mass layoffs. It merely calls for a measure of
common courtesy on the part of those companies that can afford it.
   Members of Congress get 60 days notice when they lose their job;
so does the president of the United States. Why shouldn't ordinary
citizens? Even President Reagan's own task force and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce say that advance notice is good business
practice.
   The president objects because he believes this is a matter for
the private sector, not the government, to decide. Well, Mr.
President, the private sector has had every opportunity to take
care of this problem on its own terms; it has failed.
   One-third of all workers get no notice; they're told to pick up
their paychecks and leave. Two-thirds of all workers get less than
two weeks' notice. They may have put in 20 years of service and
have two kids in college, but they're out of the street _ just like
that.
   Years ago, the American people decided that it makes sense to
ease the social and economic costs of unrestrained free enterprise.
We enacted child labor, minimum wage and antitrust laws. The plant
closing provision is squarely in this tradition.
   Critics say the provision has nothing to do with competitveness.
They're wrong. If a worker had advance notice of a layoff, he has
time to make arrangements for retraining before the clock starts
ticking on his unemployment insurance. Reducing the period of
unemployment; facilitating retraining; that is what improving labor
productivity is all about.
   Today, America needs a workforce that is flexible and adaptable,
able to shift rapidly to changing economic conditions. Germany and
Japan have already figured this out; they have advance-notice
requirements. To oppose this provision is to resist an effort to
move this country into the 1990s.
   It is tragic that the president is threatening to kill the
entire bipartisan trade bill on account of this one provision. In
truth, his opposition is really based on symbolism; he fears a
symbolic victory for labor.
   Is mere symbolism worth the price of needlessly unemployed
people and depressed communities? Is it worth the price of another
several years without a coherent foreign economic policy? Is it
worth killing a bipartisan bill which Congress spent three years
on? Common sense says no.
   Mr. President, the country is ready for the 1990s. For the sake
of the American people, sign the trade bill.

   A fire Saturday blackened a 27-story
building that houses the government radio and television stations,
and 40 people were overcome by smoke, government and hospital
officials said.
   Officials said the fire was caused by an electrical short
circuit. Employees in the building said they smelled wires burning.
   Smoke billowed from windows on the eighth floor, where the fire
started, and several floors above and below.
   Witnesses said they saw 20 fire engines and about a dozen
ambulances at the scene. Firefighters used ladders to rescue people
trapped on the stricken floors. Some were overcome by smoke.
   An official at the state-owned Boulac General Hospital near the
radio-TV building said 20 people were brought there for treatment
of smoke inhalation. Seventeen were treated and discharged, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and the other
three were ``under observation but in good condition.''
   Police sources said another 20 people overcome by smoke were
taken to another hospital, treated and discharged.
   The fire briefly interrupted transmissions on the two television
channels that broadcast during the day.
   Samira Mounir, an actress who was in a recording studio in the
building, said: ``The smoke was so thick we couldn't see each
other. We just groped our way out.''
   The 28-year-old building houses about 6,000 radio and television
employees and the Information Ministry that controls them.
   It was not known how many people were inside the building when
the fire broke out. Many rushed from their offices and studios to
escape the smoke and crowded onto the tree-lined street, paralyzing
traffic for more than a half a mile in both directions.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 15,000 gay rights supporters marched
Saturday to protest a new anti-homosexuality law that they say will
allow censorship of the arts.
   The demonstrators gathered from all over the country and
streamed through central London to a rally against the government
bill, which becomes law on June 1.
   Actress Maria Aitken said she supported the protest because she
is worried that the law will result in censorship of works by
homosexuals.
   The government measure is a blanket stipulation stating that
local authorities must not ``intentionally promote homosexuality.''
   The government has accused some left-wing local authorities of
using state funds to promote homosexuality as an acceptable
lifestyle.
   Opponents say wording of the measure is so broad that it can be
used to censor artistic works, particularly books and plays by or
about homosexuals.
   Several members of the Royal Shakespeare Company joined
Saturday's march. A British legislator and two Italian lawmakers
also took part in the protest.
   One demonstrator, actor Michael Cashman, is widely known for his
role as Colin, a gay man in the British Broadcasting Corp.'s soap
opera ``EastEnders,'' broadcast in the United States.
   ``The importance of this protest is to show that we are
determined to stand up and fight for our rights as human beings,''
he said.
   In New York City, about a hundred sympathizers demonstrated in
midtown Manhattan, carrying placards in support of the British
homosexual cause.

   The decision to widen the U.S. military
role in the Persian Gulf could make the United States the policeman
of the waterway, despite its aversion to the task, gulf shipping
officials said Saturday.
   The shipping community generally welcomed President Reagan's
decision to expand its protection of foreign vessels from attacks
by Iran. But some shippers also complained that the new policy does
not go far enough.
   ``The best attitude to adopt now is a wait-and-see one,'' said a
shipping executive who has complained that his vessels, mainly
flying Asian flags, were left at the mercy of Iran as the big
powers protected their own shipping.
   ``From what has been annnounced, protection has not been
guaranteed for all ships,'' he said. ``It sounds like an elastic
policy that will be used by the United States at the right moment,
when they choose to take on the Iranians.''
   Under the policy announced Friday, U.S. forces will go to the
aid of non-communist, neutral ships that ask for help after being
fired upon.
   Previously, U.S. warships protected only those ships reflagged
with U.S. flags or registered as U.S.-flagged vessels, including 11
Kuwaiti oil tankers.
   The Navy escorts through the gulf, however, frequently have
picked up ``hitchhiker'' vessels that are not U.S. flagged.
   ``In effect, (the new policy) could turn out to be a substitute
for the proposal to have a U.N. naval task force protect shipping
in the gulf until the Iraq-Iran war ends,'' said another gulf
shipping executive.
   ``And despite statements by U.S. officials, the United States is
going to find itself becoming the policeman in the waterway.''
   He was referring to U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci's
comment that despite the policy change, the United States was not
the ``policemen of the gulf, nor do we wish to be.''
   Said another executive: ``I think the Americans are taking on a
tremendous load ... doing the job the United Nations is supposed to
do.''
   Iran's state-run radio said Saturday that Washington's decision
proved the United States was backing Iraq in the 7{-year-old war.
   The radio said that by protecting neutral vessels, the United
States will be ``seeking to limit the Islamic Republic of Iran's
retaliatory powers.''
   Iran attacks neutral vessels in retaliation for Iraqi strikes on
Iranian oil installations and tankers.
   In the past year, 46 Americans have been killed in or near the
gulf, including two U.S. Marine pilots who disappeared with their
aircraft April 18 after reporting hostile radar locked on their
helicopter. Iran claimed the aircraft was shot down.
   The biggest loss of American life occurred May 17 in an
accidental Iraqi missile strike on the frigate Stark. Thirty-seven
U.S. sailors died.
   The Soviet Union has sought a multinational naval escort force
in the gulf under the U.N. flag. Less than 10 percent of the ships
sailing gulf waters fly communist-bloc flags
   The gulf supplies nearly 20 percent of the non-communist world's
petroleum and is the major trading route for the coastal states
that depend on imports for most of their food and commodity
supplies.
   The spread of hostilities into the gulf from the Iraq-Iran war
has harmed port trade and tended to reduce ship traffic in the
waterway.
   Still, an average of 20 tankers and freighters a day make their
way in and out of the Strait of Hormuz, the entry to the gulf.
   On Saturday, the 27th convoy this year of reflagged Kuwaiti
ships headed out of the gulf escorted by U.S. Navy warships, a U.S.
military spokesman said.
   U.S., British, French, Italian and Soviet warships escorting
their commercial vessels became routine last year when the Iranians
stepped up their attacks on commercial shipping with gunboat
attacks and the laying of mines.
   None of the shipping executives who commented on the U.S. policy
change would be quoted by name. Many of the officials do business
with both Iraq and Iran.
   Some shipping executives said they believed Iran would find ways
to continue menacing ships despite the expanded U.S. Navy role.
   ``Who's to prevent the Iranians sowing hundreds of mines in the
waterway? They manufacture them,'' said one. ``Who's to prevent
them firing Silkworm anti-ship missiles at a convoy moving through
the Hormuz?
   ``They will be ready to take in stride the U.S. Navy taking on
all their missile batteries there. In the end, it's the United
States that will be the loser, finding itself in a state of war.''

   Maoist guerrillas hanged three peasant
women in the highlands after accusing them of washing soldiers'
clothes and selling food to the soldiers, police said Saturday.
   Elsewhere, an armed cadre of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement, a pro-Cuba rebel group, seized a Lima bus late Friday on
a downtown street, ordered passengers off, exploded firebombs and
burned the bus, police said.
   A column of Shining Path guerrillas dragged the three peasant
women from their home in an isolated farming settlement before dawn
Friday and strung them up on a nearby tree, police said.
   ``We hanged them like dogs for collaborating with dogs,''
witnesses quoted one of the guerrillas as saying.
   The women, aged 60, 50 and 25, lived together in Ruguyoc, 35
miles north of the state capital, Ayacucho, which is 235 miles
southeast of Lima.
   The fanatical Shining Path frequently has shot or stabbed to
death peasants in reprisal for aid the campesinos provide to the
military.
   The government says more than 10,000 people, mainly highland
peasants, have been killed during the Shining Path's eight-year
insurgency to install a worker-peasant state.
   The Tupac Amaru group has been active, mainly in Lima, since
1984. The group is smaller and considered much less violent that
the Shining Path.

   Police combed streets and
detained an Iraqi and Iranian after a warning that Palestinian
terrorists were planning to bomb a U.S. air base, officials said
Saturday.
   Authorities also picked up an off-duty American soldier and an
Australian tourist whose beards led authorities to mistake them for
Palestinians. Both men were released after an identity check, the
officials said.
   The roundups came Friday and Saturday after Philippine officials
said they received a warning that Palestinians planned to bomb
Clark Air Base and bars frequented by American servicemen during
the weekend.
   Police told reporters they received a report from the Israeli
secret service Mossad that the bombings were to be carried out by
at least eight Palestinians. But the U.S. and Israeli embassies in
Manila said they had no knowledge of such a warning.
   Despite the stepped-up patrols of Philippine authorities, U.S.
and Filipino troops guarding the sprawling U.S. base took no
special security measures that were visible.
   Officials at Clark could not be contacted for comment. But base
spokesman Maj. Thomas Boyd appeared Saturday on the U.S. military's
Far East Network and warned the American military community to be
on the alert for bomb attacks.
   Boyd made no reference to a Palestinian threat, but he urged
service members and families to be on the lookout for unattended
packages in restaurants and other public places.
   In October, American authorities stepped up security at Clark,
Subic Naval Base and four smaller U.S. installations after
communist rebels killed three Americans and a Filipino near Clark.
   Also Saturday, in Manila, 50 miles to south of Clark, U.S.
Ambassador Nicholas Platt cautioned the Philippine government
against ending the lease on U.S. military bases.
   In a speech to American and Filipino war veterans, Platt asked,
``Does the Philippines wish the United States to continue to share
the burden of Philippine defense?''
   Platt said that in exchange for the bases, the United States
guarantees the Philippines' defense against external aggression. He
said the arrangement enables the 160,000-member Filipino army to
concentrate on fighting the country's 20-year communist insurgency.
   U.S. and Philippine officials began early this month to review
the 1947 agreement under which the United States operates military
bases in the country. The lease expires in 1991.
   In Angeles City, Filipino police and soldiers immediately
stepped up patrols after receiving the warning Thursday. Police
chief Lt. Col. Orlando Macaspac said he had set up checkpoints to
inspect vehicles entering the city. He said he had also posted
operatives at hotels, restaurants and bars.
   Iraqi Kamil Shariff Babi and Iranian Ghesan Shooat Bakhsh, both
32, were picked up on two buses from Manila which soldiers stopped
at a checkpoint Friday night, authorities said.
   The two were detained because they could show no passports,
according to Lt. Col. Victor Signey, chief of the Philippine
Constabulary's Angeles command. No charges had been filed against
them.
   Signey said he wanted to check a U.N. document Babi presented
saying he was a political refugee. Babi told police he lived in
Angeles with his American wife and two children.
   Bakhsh said he was a medical student at a university in Dagupan
City farther north and that his passport had been confiscated by
immigration authorities in the capital.

   President Najib of Afghanistan will
visit India early next month for talks with the Indian government,
Kabul radio reported Saturday.
   The radio broadcast monitored in New Delhi said the visit likely
would take place in the first week of May. Najib will lead a
high-level delegation to New Delhi for official talks, the
state-run radio said.
   Indian officials contacted by telephone could not immediately
confirm the report.
   India, which has close ties to the Soviet Union, invited Najib
for talks last week. The invitation came from Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops are to begin pulling out of
Afghanistan on May 15 under an accord signed in Geneva on April 14.
The troops entered the landlocked nation in December 1979 to prop
up the communist government.
   India did not condemn the Soviet presence in Afghanistan and
officially maintained that the troops came on the invitation of the
Afghan government.
   Gandhi has been seeking to take part in the latest developments
in Afghanistan. He invited President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq of
Pakistan for talks on the Afghan situation, but Zia declined the
invitation.
   Pakistan has been home for thousands of Afghan refugees and
rebels who left their country because of the conflict.

   A French patrol boat opened fire on
Melanesian separatists Saturday in the navy's first direct role in
violence that has left seven people dead on this island territory.
   Twenty-one French police officers were still held hostage in
caves on the New Caledonian island of Ouvea. An opposition
spokesman demanded that France agree to a referendum on
independence.
   In Paris, the main separatist movement accused the French
government of waging a ``colonial war'' against the native
Melanesians.
   About 25 military policemen traded gunfire with about 30 armed
rebels near a guerrilla encampment at Pouebo, a village on the
island's east coast, said Philippe Berges, chief of staff at the
French High Commission office here.
   A patrol boat just off the coast fired submachine guns at the
insurgents, he said. No injuries were reported on either side.
   But the exchange was indicative of the rapidly escalating
proportions of the conflict. Asked if the insurgency had reached
civil war stage, Berges said: ``It's beginning to look that way.''
   The main separatist group, the Kanak Socialist National
Liberation Front, said in a statement in Paris that the navy
detroyed a fishermen's cooperative in Pouebo. It charged that the
French army was stepping up its operations throughout the territory.
   ``Faced with this situation of colonial war, the Kanak people
are organizing to thwart the occupation forces,'' the statement
said.
   Front spokesman Leopold Joredie said Saturday that the group
wants a mediator appointed to negotiate terms of an island-wide
referendum on self-rule.
   He said a mediator must be named before the insurgents will
respond to President Francois Mitterrand's appeal for the immediate
release of the hostages.
   The violence began April 22 when separatists tried to block
French presidential elections scheduled on New Caledonia on April
24. Rebels raided a police station, kidnapping 27 gendarmes and
killing four others.
   Twelve hostages were subsequently released. But eight more
lawmen were seized Wednesday when they tried to negotiate the
release of the remaining hostages.
   Two of those hostages, the head of an anti-terrorism squad and
an assistant prosecutor, were subsequently released and ordered to
negotiate on behalf of the terrorists. They were told the remaining
hostages would be killed if the two men did not return to the rebel
hideout.
   Because of that threat, the government said it considers the two
to still be hostages.
   The native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of
the territory's 145,000 people. About 36 percent of the population
is European, with the rest primarily Asian or Tahitian.

<HEAD>Khrushchev Paved Way For Glasnost, Son Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nikita Khrushchev laid the groundwork
for glasnost more than three decades ago, the son of the late
Soviet leader was quoted Saturday as saying.
   The democratic-style reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev are similar to changes unsuccessfully sought by
Khrushchev, Sergei Khrushchev was quoted as saying in an interview
with the Yugoslav daily Vjesnik.
   ``I hope Mikhail Gorbachev succeeds where my father did not,
because there is no alternative to changes and perestroika,'' he
said. Perestroika, or reconstruction, and glasnost, or openess, are
buzzwords for Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``My father was the first to `shake' the Soviet bureaucratic
society. He dared to unmask (Soviet dictator Joseph) Stalin, start
economic reforms and democratization and urge a dialogue with the
United States on curbing the arms race,'' Sergei Khrushchev was
quoted as saying.
   ``If my father had not begun then, 33 years ago, it would be
more difficult for Gorbachev now.''
   Excerpts of what was described as Sergei Khrushchev's first
interview with a foreign journalist were carried by the state news
agency Tanjug. Tanjug did not say when or where the interview was
given or disclose personal details about the younger Khrushchev.
   His comments came just a few days after a Soviet newspaper,
Moscow News, made similar observations.
   The report also came as Soviet scholars and writers are trying
to come to grips with Stalin's legacy. During Stalin's almost three
decades of rule, millions of Soviets died as a result of purges and
crash programs of industrialization and collectivization of
agriculture.
   Khrushchev consolidated his power after Stalin died in 1953 but
was forced out in 1964 by Communist Party leaders, including his
ultimate successor, Leonid Brezhnev.
   Sergei Khrushchev charged that Brezhnev's treatment of his
father was ``inhuman.''
   ``My father always behaved correctly toward Brezhnev. He brought
him to the Kremlin, but Brezhnev (leaned) toward those who
conspired against Khrushchev.''
   Sergei Khrushchev said his father was competely isolated after
removal from power and when he died, the Communist Party daily
Pravda mentioned it in a three-line announcement.
   He said he was working on the publication of his father's
memoirs.

   Members of the country's main
guerrilla movement, the African National Congress, are reeling from
a string of setbacks, including revelations of a spy in their midst
and a crackdown on anti-apartheid groups.
   Three guerrillas face a possible trip to the gallows, one leader
was assassinated and a purported informer supposedly photographed
secret guerrilla documents and turned them over to the government.
   Congress leaders acknowledge the setbacks and have acknowledged
that South Africa's nearly 2-year-old state of emergency has
hobbled ANC efforts to undermine white-minority rule.
   During a recent trip to ANC headquarters in Zambia, guerrilla
leaders engaged in ``an orgy of self-criticism,'' according to a
story last week in The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper.
   But it said there remained lingering optimism.
   ``The emergency and the general repression are counterproductive
for the regime,'' ANC official Steve Tshwete was quoted as saying.
``In terms of heightening resentment and mobilizing mass opinion .
.. the situation is favorable for our activities.''
   But the bad news for the congress includes:
   _ The March 29 assassination of guerrilla leader Dulcie
September in Paris.
   _ The April 7 maiming of Albie Sachs, a lawyer and ANC member
who was seriously injured by a car bomb in Mozambique.
   _ The April 15 death of a guerrilla killed when a mine he was
carrying blew up in Pretoria, prompting pro-government newspapers
to claim the group has stooped to using poorly trained ``kamikaze''
bombers.
   In February, the government prohibited political activities by
major anti-apartheid groups. In addition, three ANC members
convicted of murder, terror and treason face possible death
sentences.
   In Messina, near the northern border with Zimbabwe, Mzondileli
Nondula, 25, and Mthetheleli Mncube, 28, are expected to be
sentenced within the next few days.
   Nondula was convicted of killing two white women and four
children who died in a blast when the truck they were riding in
struck a mine. Mncube was convicted of planting a mine that killed
a black man in November 1985 and of killing two white policemen
during a subsequent escape attempt.
   In the southeastern city of Pietermaritzburg, Gordon Webster,
24, was convicted of carrying out several bombings, including one
that killed a police colonel.
   At another trial of three alleged ANC members charged with
terrorism and treason, evidence submitted included secret internal
documents, purportedly photographed by a spy, that cited problems
faced by the guerrilla movement because of informers and shortages
of weapons and funds.
   Defense witnesses described Webster as a gentle young man who
joined the congress in a state of despair over racial
discrimination in South Africa, where the system of apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.
   Taking the stand to plead for his life, Webster professed
loyalty to the congress but voiced some disenchantment.
   Asked what he would do if he could start over again, he replied:
``I would like to be a teacher.''
   Formed as a non-violent civil rights group in 1912, the ANC was
banned in 1960 and a year later began a bombing and sabotage
campaign.
   Its tactics are repudiated by some moderate blacks, but it is
believed capable of winning a national election if restrictions on
black voting rights and political activity were lifted.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama's international banking center
was once a magnet for money from throughout the world, a safe haven
for cash that earned the country a reputation as the Switzerland of
Latin America.
   Now, bankers worry that the system may never recover from a
nearly two-month shutdown caused by political unrest surrounding
the leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Frightened investors have pulled billions of dollars out of
Panama. Bankers are anxiously studying their options.
   ``I assume ... (bankers) would be thinking about leaving the
country because they can't do much business right now,'' said
Edgardo Lasso, president of the Banking Association of Panama,
which represents 93 of the 117 mostly foreign banks operating here.
   Eiichi Motoshige, general manager of the local branch of Japan's
giant Sumitomo Bank, said: ``Each bank is very, very seriously
considering what we can do for the immediate future.
   ``The biggest problem,'' he said, ``is that nobody likes to
place any funds here ... because of the risk.''
   Not long ago, the tiny country attracted money from investors
worldwide, many of them drawn by secrecy provisions limiting
disclosure of information to foreign courts, governments and other
third parties.
   They also were attracted by the nation's use of the U.S. dollar
as its currency, its prominent free-trade zone and its location on
an isthmus linking Central and South America.
   And, up until June, it offered investors political stability.
But a wave of protest against Noriega's rule has shaken confidence
in the system.
   Noriega, chief of the country's defense forces and the power
behind the civilian government, was indicted on drug charges in the
United States in February. He forced the ouster of President Eric
Arturo Delvalle on Feb. 26, one day after Delvalle tried to fire
him.
   On March 3, the government shut down 67 banks holding licenses
to conduct local and international banking business after $50
million in Panamanian government money was frozen in U.S. banks.
   The subsequent cash shortage prevented the National Bank of
Panama from providing the dozen locally owned banks with enough
money to cover a run on deposits that began Feb. 26.
   The Reagan administration, seekng to force Noriega's ouster, has
imposed sweeping economic sanctions on the country.
   The administration announced Saturday that it was relaxing some
restrictions and would allow Americans to pay utility bills and
sales and excise taxes to the government. Payments on corporate and
personal income taxes, import duties, port fees and corporate
social security payments still are prohibited.
   Government figures show that assets held by the banking center
tumbled from $40.3 billion at the end of 1986 to $31.4 billion at
the end of 1987.
   ``There was a massive reduction in assets beginning in June,''
said Luis Luis, Latin American director of the Institute of
International Finance in Washington.
   ``There must have been further shrinkage of assets in the first
quarter (of this year),'' he said.
   Motoshige said, ``So many banks, including ourselves, have had
to move our assets outside.''
   About three-quarters of the center's assets, or roughly $25
billion, were in off-shore activities at the end of last year.
   Money in off-shore activities _ those that take place outside of
Panama _ can be easily moved to competing banking centers in Miami,
the Bahamas, Grand Cayman Island in the British West Indies and
elsewhere.
   Analysts have no figures on how much money has left the banking
system so far this year. Estimates vary widely from a few billion
dollars to more than $10 billion. One financial analyst, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said, ``They will be lucky if they come
out of this with $5 billion in off-shore banking.''
   Requests for interviews with officials of the National Banking
Commission, a regulatory agency, were ignored.
   Bankers say that only after the nation's political troubles are
settled can the center begin healing.
   ``There would have to be several changes in the government,''
said Lasso. ``People would have to start getting confidence back in
their people handling the government and that could take ...
months.''
   The banking commission has been trying to ease the situation.
   On April 18, it allowed the banks to begin accepting deposits
from customers. But it restricted the amount of money that could be
drawn on the balance in checking accounts.
   As a result, analysts say, about three-quarters of the newly
deposited checks were returned for insufficient funds.
   In March, the commission allowed banks to resume a dozen
additional services, including handling letters of credit,
collecting outstanding loans, transferring funds within the country
and making foreign exchange transactions.
   Clients still cannot withdraw cash from their accounts, and
bankers fear a premature reopening of their institutions would
trigger another run.
   ``People are afraid, and they are just waiting for the banks to
open so they can get their money out,'' said Lasso.

   The gawkers began gathering more than
an hour before the 9 p.m. start of the first Forrest City High
School Senior Prom in more than a quarter-century.
   They sat in pickup trucks and cars in the parking lot of the
Civic Center; others cruised the lot, eyeing the front door. Some
may have been drawn by the mobile van of a Little Rock television
station, its satellite transmission dish aimed skyward.
   Mostly, they were curious.
   It was the first integrated Senior Prom for the school. The last
Senior Prom was held in 1962 and blacks did not begin attending
Forrest City High until 1965.
   A group of black junior high youngsters gathered near the
entrance, waiting to see what their older friends and relatives
looked like in their tuxedos and formals _ some bought, some made
and some rented.
   ``We'll be going to the Junior Prom'' in May, said Ora Jamerson,
14, from amid a group of four young girls. In the meantime, she was
enjoying the spectacle, calling out to her older friends, waving,
admiring their togs.
   Janet Hamm, 18, among the older, white onlookers, wasn't dressed
for the prom. She dropped out of school in January.
   ``I don't think it'll work out,'' she said. ``There's a lot of
racial problems in Forrest City. I just don't think it'll work
out.''
   But police, who were on hand to enforce the school
administration's strict no-cigarettes, no-alcohol, no-drug policy,
said the celebration proceeded without incident.
   ``Everything stayed quiet,'' Police Sgt. Willie Gibbs said at 2
a.m. Saturday.
   Outside the Civic Center, as the prom got under way, there were
a few good-natured jeers at unfamiliar finery _ no catcalls or
taunts, racial or otherwise.
   Tangella Brown, 17, Student Council president, said just having
it all finally come together, after months of planning, was perhaps
the most important thing for her. The final day's preparations and
decorations took so long that she was 45 minutes late herself.
   Earlier in the week, she said the prom owed its existence to the
enthusiasm of her classmates, who number about 350.
   ``Each class has their own thoughts about things, each class
thinks they're better,'' she said. ``We felt like we would have a
prom, and we did.''

<TEXT>
   The world's largest commercial jetliner, an
enlarged 747 with fuel-efficient engines and electronic cockpit
displays, made its aerial debut ``beautifully,'' says the test
pilot of the latest Boeing jumbo jet.
   The first Boeing 747-400 was taken on a 2{-hour flight Friday
from Paine Field at Everett, where the jumbo jets are made, to
Boeing Field in Seattle, where The Boeing Co. has its headquarters.
   Just a few minutes after the newest plane touched down, the
original 747, the ``City of Everett,'' which first flew in 1969,
also landed at Boeing Field. That plane was never flown
commercially but has been used by Boeing for various test programs
and now is used for crew training.
   ``The airplane worked beautifully,'' test pilot James C. Loesch
told reporters.
   The new jumbo jet measures 231 feet, 10 inches in length, same
as the original, with a 211-foot wingspan, up from 195 feet on the
original model 747-100.
   The new jumbo jet has a stretched upper deck and can carry as
many as 660 passengers, but normally would carry about 450 in three
classes: first, business and coach. The model 100 seated 385
passengers.
   Its most noticeable feature are six-foot ``winglets'' tilted
upward at the tip of each wing, which improve aerodynamic
efficiency. It has a range of 8,400 miles, compared to the
747-100's 5,200 miles.
   The other major change is on the flight deck, where more than
600 dials and switches have been replaced by six color video
screens, allowing a crew of just two to operate the aircraft,
instead of the usual three.
   Boeing boasts the plane will be able to fly non-stop between
such cities as London and Tokyo, New York and Seoul, and Los
Angeles and Sydney, Australia.
   The plane can be equipped with three different makes of engines
_ Pratt & Whitney, General Electric and Rolls-Royce _ which cut
fuel consumption by up to 25 percent over the engines used on the
original 747, Boeing says.
   The jet that flew Friday, dubbed 747-401, will be delivered to
Northwest Airlines in December. Two others in the test flight
program will be delivered to Lufthansa and Cathay Pacific.
   The three planes will make about 1,100 hours of test flights
under about 10 Boeing test pilots and three from the Federal
Aviation Administration, said Jerry Zanatta, manager of flight test
engineering. About 430 hours of test flying is needed for FAA
certification, he said.
   To date, 18 airlines have ordered 124 of the 747-400s, which
cost $108 million to $126 million each. Because of its fuel economy
and other savings, several carriers have changed orders during
recent years from earlier 747 versions to the model 400.
   The new Air Force One will be a 747-400, as will the military
E-4A and E-4B, flying command and control stations for national
emergencies such as nuclear war.

<HEAD>Volunteers Develop Immune Response To AIDS Vaccine Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first American test of an experimental
AIDS vaccine produced an immune response in six volunteers and is
an important step toward developing a vaccine against the deadly
disease, officials said Saturday.
   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
announced that the men showed the immune reaction to injections of
a purified protein, called gp160, derived from a portion of the
human immunodeficiency virus. HIV is the virus that causes acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   An immune response is determined when the test subject's blood
develops antibodies against the vaccine that was injected.
   Many steps remain, however, before the work could result in an
AIDS vaccine.
   Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the institute, said the vaccine
tests were conducted to determine if the gp160-derived vaccine was
safe and if it evoked an immune response. He said the results are
now positive to both questions.
   ``It is clear that it is safe, and the study indicates that
several volunteers did develop an immune response,'' he said.
   The test also is designed to help determine the proper dosage of
the vaccine for maximum beneficial effect.
   A report on the study was presented at the annual meeting of the
American Foundation for Clinical Research.
   The next step is to remove antibodies from the test subjects and
determine if these antibodies will react in test tubes to the AIDS
virus. This would establish if the test subjects have developed
what is called cell mediated immune response. It is this reaction
that provides protection against a targeted disease.
   The test of gp160 started with 59 volunteers divided into four
groups. Each group received injections of a different strength of
the gp160.
   Two subjects in a group that received the injections but no
booster shots developed immune response. Four of a group that
received both the initial shot and a booster also developed immune
response.
   The study will continue with a group of volunteers receiving an
even stronger dose of the gp160 vaccine.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. The virus most often is spread through close contact
with blood, blood products or semen from infected persons.
   As of April 21, AIDS had been diagnosed in about 59,500
Americans, of whom more than half, or about 33,000, have died since
June 1981, according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is
known to have recovered from AIDS.

   The accidental release of at least
175,000 gallons of a particularly gooey form of crude oil has
turned from a minor inconvenience into a major menace to fragile
bird rookeries and a major sports fishing industry.
   ``This is a sin, a crime against God's creation, and makes a
city boy want to cry,'' said Joseph Hallachi, 43, of Santa Cruz,
who drove 120 miles to voluntarily help state crews remove oil from
a city park shoreline.
   The April 23 spill already has killed 200 birds and small
animals and left 250 others suffering ill effects.
   The spill of San Joaquin crude from Shell Oil Co.'s major
Northern California refinery occurred after a broken storm drain
pipe running through the middle of an oil tank allowed crude to be
siphoned out. The company's practice of keeping valves open during
storms was a violation of federal environmental regulations.
   It has been a frustrating week for dozens of volunteers trying
to care for dying wildlife and for cleanup workers struggling to
remove the tarry muck.
   They have been busy along a 15-mile stretch of waterway from the
Carquinez Strait to the mouth of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
with their major sport fishing industry, and at Peyton Slough marsh
and Ryer Island, critical wildlife habitat for the endangered
clapper rail and dozens of other bird species, including various
ducks, blue heron, black rail and California brown pelican.
   ``This is the worst possible thing that can happy to a pretty
place like this,'' said Sheri Banks, 21, a member of the California
Conservation Corps, a state job skills training program, who helped
gather up oil.
   ``It'll never be the same. I don't think a man's hands can clean
all this up,'' added fellow corps member Steven Reed, 19, rubbing
his gloves on yellow protective coveralls nearly black below the
chest.
   ``Shell Oil people should be the ones forced to come down here
and clean these rocks themselves,'' he said.
   Those sentiments are echoed by city residents, by state
officials who blasted Shell for violating federal regulations and
environmentalists who fear for the future of California's dwindling
wetlands, where many shore and water creatures breed and reproduce.
   ``There's a lot of dismay by almost everybody who lives here,''
said Jack Garner, city manager of Martinez, population 30,000.
Except for Shell's administration building, loading dock and wharf,
the 1,000-acre refinery is outside city limits, and thus beyond
city regulation.
   At a state hearing at Martinez City Hall on the spill Friday,
Garner predicted ``there'll be an awful lot of anger, an awful lot
of frustration, and an awful lot of anxiety about our future in the
company's shadow.
   ``Up to this point, there's never been such a graphic physical
illustration of what the worst-case scenario with that plant could
be.''
   Local boat owners, many of whom make a living by taking sports
fishermen into the delta, fear the oil will harm the estuary's
delicate food chain and possibly deplete fish stocks already
reduced by decades of water quality problems in the delta.
   Most of the 400 boats at the city's marina still had oil on
their hulls this weekend; under federal regulations, they can't
leave docks until they are cleaned. Shell promised to pick up the
tab.
   The San Francisco Bay area's largest yacht race of the year was
canceled Saturday because oil was still in Vallejo's harbor.
Patrick Lane, vice commodore of the sponsoring Vallejo Yacht Club,
said Shell officials asked for the cancellation, preferring to
reimburse the club's losses of up to $60,000 rather than possibly
being liable for cleaning boats. About 700 boat owners had paid
entry fees.
   Harbormaster Barry Wysling closed the marina until all oil
sheens are removed from the strait and delta. That prevented dozens
of ocean fishermen from participating in Sunday's opening of the
salmon season.
   Environmentalists are concerned over the effects of oil in the
marshes.
   ``The marshes are devastated ... and there are toxins in that
oil that is seeping into the environment every day,'' said Neal
Welsh, a biologist and vice president of Mount Diablo Audubon
Society.
   ``It's going to take a Herculean effort to return it to its
natural state,'' he added. ``If they leave it alone, it will take
decades to return of its own accord.''
   Shell spokesman Bill Sharkey said the company will ``pay
whatever it costs'' to restore the damaged marshes.
   ``These wetlands and estuaries are the cradle of the oceans,
where they get energy and nutrients,'' said Welsh. ``We're not
insisting on saving them just for aesthetics and recreation. We're
talking about saving life itself.''

   Striking ferry workers pelted busloads of
tourists with rocks and bottles Saturday after mistaking them for
strikebreakers, police said. Later, two ferries docked at Dover as
the company moved to crush the work stoppage.
   Trouble flared early Saturday when five buses carrying ferry
passengers drove to the dock behind a police cruiser with flashing
lights. Hundreds of pickets, mistaking the tourists for
strikebreaking crews, surged through police lines, threw rocks and
bottles at the buses and hammered on the windows, police said.
   About 150 officers moved in and quickly broke up the dsturbances
after scuffles with pickets.
   Dover police Inspector Mervyn Williams said a bus windshield was
smashed but no one was hurt. One striker was arrested but was later
released without charge.
   Police Superintendent Tim O'Connor said the buses were carrying
passengers into the ferry terminal for crossings on French and
Belgian ships to Calais and Ostend.
   ``Some of them were schoolchildren,'' O'Connor said. ``They were
terrified.''
   Police quickly restored order, but Sam McCluskie, leader of the
24,400-member National Union of Seamen, said: ``I cannot guarantee
it will be peaceful for long. I want peace, but these men and women
have been frustrated to the extent I will not be able to control
them.''
   The P and O strike and support by other seamen also affected
crossings from England and Wales to Ireland and the Isle of Man,
and between Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Shetland and
Orkney islands.
   Later Saturday, two ferries sailed into Dover without incident
after crossing the English Channel.
   Strikebound P and O European Ferries Ltd. said the Pride of
Bruges and the Pride of Kent picked up replacement crews and sailed
from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to Dover, one of the world's
busiest ports.
   P and O said the two ferries would begin crossing the English
Channel on a regular basis.
   McCluskie said British crews on the P and O ferries ``will be
marked as scabs forever.''
   The company refused to say when the ferries would try to load
passengers and freight and set sail for France. The captain of the
Pride of Kent, however, told Dover Harbor Board in a ship-to-shore
radio message: ``We will be laid here for 24 hours _ at least that
is Plan A.'' Details of the plan were not made known.
   ``The ships are in port while provisioning is completed and it
is made ready to take passengers,'' said P and O director Graeme
Dunlop.
   P and O workers are striking to protest the company's plan to
cut jobs, lengthen shifts and change work rules to have employees
perform more tasks. The company says its must trim its staff so it
can compete with the English Channel tunnel connecting England and
France, which is set to open in 1992.
   About 750 pickets gathered on the dockside during the night to
protest the arrival of the two P and O ferries from Rotterdam.
   The ferries, carrying 250 crew members but no passengers,
anchored overnight in the Solent and then sailed into port and
berthed Saturday morning.
   P and O and its main rival, Sealink British Ferries, hit by a
sympathy strike, warned of long delays at Dover for any vacationers
heading for continental Europe during the three-day British holiday
weekend.
   The Pride of Kent and the Pride of Bruges were among five of P
and O's 17 vessels that had been moored in Rotterdam since the
strike began Feb. 4.
   They were crewed by 250 of the 1,100 P and O seamen who have
accepted the company's new terms. P and O this week fired 720
workers still on strike.

<HEAD>Only Condor Chick Conceived In Captivity Eats First Meals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hungry bundle of fluff named Molloko, the
only California condor chick conceived in captivity, gobbled minced
mice Saturday, and keepers of the endangered species were
encouraged by its appetite.
   The newly hatched chick, which raised the condor population to
28, ate its first meal from the fingertips of a handler at 6 a.m.
and ate again at hourly intervals, said Martha Baker, spokeswoman
for the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   ``The chick was hungry and ate everything it was offered,'' Ms.
Baker said. ``Everyone seems very pleased with the progress of the
chick. But the first 10 days are critical, for anybody, human or
animal.''
   The chick's diet was a combination of minced baby mice and
chicken egg yolk, she said. The meals fed to the chick, which is
slightly larger than a person's fist, amounted to about two
tablespoons of food each time.
   U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel congratulated the Wild
Animal Park staff for the successful hatching.
   ``The hatching of the world's first captive-bred condor is a
milestone that we've been awaiting for years,'' Hodel said in a
statement released in Washington. The Interior Department's U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service is responsible for the California condor
recovery program.
   ``This small chick represents a big step back from the brink of
extinction and a big step forward for recovery of the California
condor,'' he said.
   Keepers delicately wielding tweezers helped the chick break free
of its avocado-size egg at 5:38 p.m. Friday, ending a 61{-hour
hatching process that began when the chick first pecked cracks in
the shell Wednesday.
   The laborious process of helping the bird get free, led by
biologist Cyndi Keuhler, took nearly eight hours.
   Molloko is an Indian word for the giant condor species. The name
originates from the Sacramento Valley Maidu tribe and was chosen by
a council of California tribes last week, Ms. Baker said.
   After hatching, the chick was swaddled in a towel and put in the
same type of incubator used for premature infants. The chick
weighed about 6{ ounces.
   Its sex won't be determined for about a month because it must be
strong enough for a blood sample to be drawn.
   The chick will be reared by keepers using a hand puppet that
resembles an adult condor. The puppet is used to feed the chick and
help it identify with its species.
   The chick hatched from an egg laid March 3 by the only pair of
California condors known to be actively breeding. The egg was taken
from the parent birds and placed in the incubator in hope that the
parents would produce a second egg. That has not happened so far.
   All 28 California condors known to exist are in captivity: 15 at
the Wild Animal Park and 13 at the Los Angeles Zoo. Fourteen birds
are female.
   The captive flock includes 13 condors hatched from eggs taken in
the wild over the past five years. Molloko was the first addition
since April 1986, when a chick named Nojoqui was hatched at the
park from an egg laid in the wild.
   Efforts to save the California condor, which has a wingspan of
up to 10 feet at maturity, rest with the captive breeding program.
The last known wild California condor was captured a year ago.
   The goal of the program is to rebuild the population until
condors can be sent back into the wild. The earliest anticipated
release would be 1992, authorities have said. The oldest bird
hatched in captivity is 5 years old. Condors reach sexual maturity
at about age 7.

   Earnest young voices from the inner-city sing
liltingly while aspiring musicians experiment with a spectrum of
styles each Saturday in a renovated train station just south of
downtown.
   They're members of the MERIT Music Program, designed to develop
the talents of children from poor neighborhoods who have no other
access to music.
   Given the chance, they're as receptive as youths whose parents
can afford private music lessons, said Lisa Richter, who runs an
opera workshop for the private, non-profit program.
   ``The goal of this program is to provide the opportunity for
these underprivileged students to flourish,'' she said in a
telephone interview Saturday.
   Teachers with extensive music backgrounds, many of them
professional musicians, provide ``as sophisticated music
instruction as you'll find anywhere in the country,'' she said.
   ``There is no other music school in the country (like MERIT) in
terms of making our services available to those who cannot pay,''
Ms. Richter added.
   But the students are required to have one year of prior music
instruction and must audition to get into the program, she said.
   The centerpiece of the program is its tuition-free Saturday
classes for elementary and high school students in the red-brick
Dearborn Station.
   Inside the old train station, about 200 students get individual
and group instruction in classes ranging from beginning piano to
advanced musical theory.
   MERIT, which employs about 33 part-time teachers, also sponsors
weekly and bi-weekly music classes in 10 Chicago public schools _
most of them in poor neighborhoods _ reaching 500 to 600 children,
Ms. Richter said.
   Those classes act as ``feeder programs,'' preparing students who
want to participate in the Saturday classes, she said.
   Once a year, for the past three years, youths in the advanced
music theory class have staged an opera composed and performed by
students.
   This year's work, a 45-minute, one-act opera called ``The
Ledge,'' is about a disillusioned young violinist who contemplates
suicide while facing his best friend's popularity as a rock star.
   The opera, to be performed Sunday in MERIT's recital hall,
features an eclectic combination of music, ranging from classical
opera to jazz complete with synthesizer, drums and electric bass
guitar.
   ``I've never really been exposed to opera,'' said Thomas White,
17, who plays bass guitar in the opera's orchestra.
   ``What surprised me the most is this was totally put together by
us. It was done totally by the students. ... I think it's good,''
said White, a senior at De La Salle High School, a nearly all-black
school in an impoverished neighborhood.
   White, who wants to teach music and perform professionally, has
attended MERIT's Saturday classes for 2{ years.
   ``They expose you to a lot of different sounds _ classical, jazz
_ a lot of different talents they help you to nurture. Someone from
my school ... they wouldn't normally be exposed to that kind of
stuff,'' he said.
   MERIT students have earned scholarships to prestigious music
programs like the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., and
the Interlochen music camp in Michigan.
   The MERIT program was started in 1979 by a professional pianist
and an amateur musician, Ms. Richter said. It is entirely funded by
grants, mostly from corporations and foundations.
   Teachers who could be making $100 an hour elsewhere earn about
$20 to $30 an hour, and all have outside jobs, said Ms. Richter,
31, a former Roosevelt University music-theory instructor who works
full time at a South Side bank.
   ``I do it simply because it is rewarding,'' Ms. Richter said.
``It gives me the opportunity to participate in these young
people's discovery of their own ability. It's extremely rewarding.''

   Lawyers for opposition leader Abdoulaye
Wade said Saturday they will no longer participate in Wade's trial
becaus of a judge's ruling.
   On Friday, the 40 European and African lawyers defending Wade
left the courtroom to protest the judge's refusal to let them
question a policeman who led the investigation into Wade's
activities.
   In a statement released Saturday, the lawyers announced their
decision to discontinue their defense of Wade, citing what they
said was a a violation by the court of the rights of the defense.
   Wade, also a lawyer, is charged with compromising state security
and inciting violence in the three days of rioting that followed
Feb. 28 presidential and legislative elections. He and seven other
opposition members face up to five years in prison if convicted of
various charges.
   Wade lost the election to President Abdou Diouf, receiving only
25 percent of the votes to Diouf's 73 percent.
   Wade said Diouf's Socialist Party rigged the elections, assuring
the president of a second five-year term and 103 seats in the
120-seat National Assembly.
   But Wade has said he was not responsible for the violence that
occurred when rampaging youths damaged buildings, barricaded
streets and burned cars in the capital after the elections. A
dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed but it was lifted two weeks ago.
   Judge Ali Cire Ba on Friday adjourned the trial until Tuesday.
He said if the defense refused to participate in the proceedings he
would ask the prosecutor to indict Wade without hearing any further
testimony.
   Wade supporters have twice clashed with riot police outside the
courtroom since the trial opened last week. On Monday they burned
five government vehicles.

<HEAD>Illinois Making Pitch for Foreign Tourists' Dollars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Illinois is taking its juiced-up
tourism campaign overseas to dispel a gangster-ridden image and
lure foreign visitors.
   ``International people still think of us as `Al Capone lives
next door,' and this is one of the things we have to dispel in
their minds,'' said Mary Burns, international marketing specialist
for the Illinois Office of Tourism.
   To do that, the state and Trans World Airlines have produced an
upbeat commercial for British television that describes Chicago as
a world-class city with a rich culture and nightlife.
   Tour brochures circulated by British Airways in West Germany
describe Chicago as ``the heart and soul of the Americas.'' They
feature inviting views of the city's lakefront and historic sites
in other parts of Illinois.
   ``Chicago and Illinois are described in detail to get rid of
this Al Capone image that still prevails,'' said Lothar Kegelmann,
market development manager in West Germany for British Airways.
   The international effort is the latest twist in a four-year
campaign that officials credit for significant growth in the
state's tourist industry.
   Since 1984, the state Office of Tourism has spent $10 million a
year on ads promoting tourism, up from about $800,000 in earlier
years.
   From 1984 to 1986, the number of employees in the state's
tourism industry increased 14 percent compared with a rise of 9
percent in the nation overall. Tourist spending in Illinois in the
fiscal year ending June 30 is expected to reach $10.8 billion, up
30 percent from $8.3 billion three years ago, state officials say.
   Officials hope to boost those figures further and say foreign
tourists are a rich, untapped market, especially in light of the
dollar's low value compared with many foreign currencies. They have
pursued a variety of strategies to lure foreigners, some costly and
some virtually free.
   To pay for the British commercials, Illinois and TWA each
contributed $200,000 and the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration
kicked in $40,000.
   Those commercials attracted the interest of British television
executives, who plan to produce a documentary on Chicago comparing
the Windy City to Paris and Rio de Janeiro.
   In the past year, state tourism officials also have helped
organize visits by 18 groups of foreign travel agents and tour
operators, and six groups of travel journalists. Ms. Burns said the
trips were paid for by airline companies, hotels and others in the
industry.
   State officials don't expect immediate dividends from the
overseas campaign. Their advisers say it typically takes five years
to produce a significant response.
   ``Don't expect miracles and don't ask for passenger numbers
within the next couple months,'' Kegelmann said. ``It takes time
and a little bit of patience, but we are confident we are going to
make it.''
   One expert believes Illinois might get a little help from the
Capone legacy.
   ``I can understand why (Illinoisans) are sensitive about Al
Capone and the so-called violent image of Chicago but I think it
has changed over the years to become a colorful image,'' said John
Cooper, director of marketing for TWA's international division.

   Smoke from a cockpit fire filled a small
plane carrying U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm Saturday, but the plane landed
safely at its destination here.
   The six-passenger Kingair plane carried Gramm, his aide Alan
Hill, state Republican Party Chairman George Strake and the pilot
and co-pilot.
   About 15 minutes after taking off from Austin, an apparent fire
in the cockpit spewed smoke into the plane, Hill said.
   Pilot Saeed Arabzadegan turned back to Austin and requested an
emergency landing, but the smoke stopped and the crew resumed the
journey to Odessa, about 350 miles northwest of Austin, Hill said.
   The plane landed without incident and Gramm was 40 minutes late
for an afternoon address to the Texas Associated Press Broadcasters
meeting.
   ``It was getting hard to see in there,'' Hill said of the smoke.
   To filter out the smoke and breathe, the pilot and passengers
used a T-shirt presented to Gramm in Austin, where he spoke to high
school students.
   ``We passed around the undershirt so everyone could breathe
through the undershirt,'' Gramm said. ``We were able to get the
smoke out of the plane.''
   Hill said mechanics in Odessa were checking the plane.

   Rioting broke out in the western city of
Poona on Saturday after a man threw human waste on a Hindu idol at
a temple during worship services, the United News of India reported.
   Officials imposed a 48-hour curfew on the city after shops were
burned in clashes between Hindus and Moslems.
   Police said one boy was severely beaten by a mob and at least 41
arrests were made.
   United News of India said a man, believed to be a Moslem, threw
the waste on a statue of Lord Ganesha during morning rituals at a
temple in the Laxmi Road area of Poona, 75 miles southeast of
Bombay.
   It reported worshipers caught the man and turned him over to
police.
   The agency said about 20 vegetable and fruit shops owned by both
Hindus and Moslems were set ablaze during street fighting.
   B.J. Misar, the city police commissioner, said police dispersed
a crowd of hundreds of Hindus gathered near the temple to protest
the incident.
   He told a ``peace committee'' meeting of all political parties
that the man suspected of hurling the waste would be charged under
the National Security Act that allows detention without trial for
up to two years.
   Hundreds of people are killed every year in Hindu-Moslem
violence in India, often provoked by minor fights or deliberate
acts such as the one in Poona.

<TEXT>
   Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin says
he is investigating whether to prosecute Gov. Rose Mofford for
omitting land, loan and partnership transactions from sworn
financial-disclosure statements.
   Corbin is prosecuting Mrs. Mofford's predecessor, Evan Mecham,
over omission of a $350,000 campaign loan from similar
financial-disclosure statements, and Mecham's lawyers are sure to
object if Mrs. Mofford is treated any differently.
   But Corbin also is next in line to become governor should
anything happen to Mrs. Mofford, much as Mrs. Mofford succeeded
Mecham upon his ouster by the Senate Court of Impeachment in April.
   ``He's in somewhat of a delicate position,'' Senate Minority
Leader Alan Stephens, a Democrat, said Friday after Mrs. Mofford
filed amended financial disclosure statements.
   Mrs. Mofford, a Democrat, called her ommissions ``an honest
mistake'' and said she did not intend to hide the transactions
reported a week before by The Associated Press.
   Mecham, a Republican, used the same language last year when his
ommission was reported by The Arizona Republic.
   Aides said Mrs. Mofford's share of the unreported transactions
would total $67,000 at most.
   Knowing failure to file a complete disclosure statement is a
misdemeanor under Arizona law. Intentional false swearing is a
felony.
   ``It's kind of the same thing that Mecham had, and we'll wait
until the A.G. tells us what he thinks,'' said House Speaker Joe
Lane, a Republican who set impeachment hearings in motion against
Mecham. ``We're going to treat her just like we did Gov. Mecham.
There's really no difference.''
   But Stephens said aspects of the Mecham case that show intent to
conceal are not present in the Mofford case. He cited the size of
the developer's loan to Mecham, a letter in which Mecham promised
to keep it confidential and a paper trail that House and Senate
prosecutors described as a laundering scheme.
   On the other hand, aides acknowledge, Mrs. Mofford spent 10
years as secretary of state in command of the office where the
forms are filed and in charge of preparing the instructions on how
to fill out the forms in the first place.
   Asked for his reaction to Mrs. Mofford's action, Corbin said
Friday, ``I have no comment because the matter is under
investigation.''
   As late as Monday, Mrs. Mofford had described reports about the
undisclosed transactions as ``nitpicking.'' On Friday, however, she
filed new forms and turned over records to Corbin's office.
   ``I now believe that these items should have been disclosed
earlier,'' she said at a news conference cut short by her aides.
``I made an honest mistake.''
   ``I'm very sorry,'' she added. ``I want to emphasize that it was
never my intent to hide anything from anybody.''
   Asked how her position differed from that Mecham, Mrs. Mofford
replied ``mine are very small amounts of money'' and added that the
transactions did not even offset what she had advanced her former
husband, T.R. Mofford, for hospital bills before he died in 1982.
   Mrs. Mofford said she did not list the land, loans and
partnerships because she did not make much money on them or because
her interest in some of them was tied to Mofford, whom she divorced
in 1967.
   ``I have never made any profit,'' she said. ``I was paying my
husband's bills.''
   Mrs. Mofford and her aides acknowledged, however, that she had
not listed her former husband's gifts under a reporting section
that requires disclosure of gifts above $500 or, alternatively,
listed the money she advanced to his estate for hospital bills in a
section covering amounts of more than $1,000 owed to or by the
officeholder.
   The holdings also were not reported under the section for
disclosing real estate.
   Records released Friday show her being paid well over $30,000
for two properties alone, but aides said she had incurred some
costs as well. The records were incomplete, and no exact accounting
was available.
   Mecham did not return messages left at his home and office
Friday.

   Palestinian youths pelted troops with stones
Saturday in scattered anti-Israeli protests in the occupied
territories, and four Palestinians and a soldier were injured,
military and Arab sources said.
   The occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were relatively quiet
after one of the calmest weeks since a Palestinian uprising began
December 8. Israeli officials, encouraged by the relative calm,
have claimed that the protests are fading.
   In the main marketplace of Nablus, the largest city in the West
Bank, Palestinian youths attacked Israeli troops with stones,
according to an army representative who spoke on condition of
anonymity. The troops opened fire and wounded a protester, he said.
   Arab reporters in Nablus said a second protester was wounded.
   In the nearby Balata refugee camp, young Palestinians hurled
stones at Israeli troops, injuring one, the spokesman said. Troops
wounded a protester there too, he said.
   The military clamped a curfew on the camp right after the
incident, forcing residents to stay home.
   In the West Bank city of Hebron, a group of Jewish settlers from
the nearby Kiryat Arba settlement were surrounded by stone-throwing
youths, the spokesman said. The settlers fired shots in the air
until troops arrived, he said, and there were no injuries.
   Also Saturday, a Palestinian youth arrived at Hebron's Alia
hospital with a gunshot wound in his arm, a doctor said. The army
confirmed the report but said it was not clear how the youth was
shot.
   In Gaza City, students blocked a main street with flaming tires,
boulders and trash cans, Arab reporters said. They waved outlawed
Palestinian flags and chanted: ``Our lives for Palestine!''
   The students dispersed on army orders, the reporters said.
   Since anti-Israeli violence broke out in the occupied
territories, which Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East War, 175
Palestinians have been slain. One Israeli soldier and one Israeli
civilian have been killed.
   Palestinian activists, in a leaflet circulated late Friday,
urged Arabs to keep the uprising alive and said ``the blood of our
martyrs must not be spilled for nothing.''
   It called for commercial strikes and a ``day of confrontation
with the occupation forces'' on Sunday.
   The leaflet, signed by the ``United Leadership of the
Upsrising,'' also made its most direct call for attacks on
Israeli-appointed Arab mayors who have refused to yield to the
militants' demands that they resign. It singled out the mayors of
the West Bank towns of Hebron, Ramallah, El Bireh and Jericho.
   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek protested a cartoon published in
the Los Angeles Times depicting Jesus being turned away from
Jerusalem by Israeli troops, who told him the city was a closed
military area.
   The cartoon, published March 30, was an apparent reference to
the frequent closures imposed by the military in the occupied
territories in an effort to quell the uprising.
   ``In all its history, Jerusalem has never been freer or more
open to visitors to holy places than it is now,'' Kollek declared
in a telegram to the paper earlier this week, said spokeswoman
Sevannah Meryn on Friday.
   The cartoon was one of two that angered Israel's consul general
in Los Angeles, Eitan Ben Tzur, Israel radio said.
   The second cartoon, published April 27, depicted an Israeli
soldier holding a smoking rifle atop a pile of bullet-ridden
bodies. The caption read: ``I'm willing to talk peace, but there
aren't any Palestinians to talk peace with!''

<TEXT>
   Older Boeing 737s, like the jet that ripped
open over Hawaii last week, were restricted Saturday from flying at
altitudes above 23,000 feet until they can be inspected for
structural defects.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order
for jets in the 737-100 and 737-200 series that have had more than
55,000 flights. The order affects 66 planes, half of them in the
fleets of Aloha, Piedmont and American airlines, FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar said. The rest belong to international carriers.
   Federal investigators are focusing on possible structural
failure in the Aloha Airlines jet that blew open Thursday at 24,000
feet. A flight attendant was swept out of the plane to her death
and 61 passengers were injured.
   Under the airworthiness directive issued by FAA Administrator T.
Allan McArtor, the airlines must complete visual inspections of the
affected area within the next 500 flights.
   ``They must inspect the area for cracking, corrosion or
de-lamination and if any is found, it must be repaired and the
suspect pieces replaced,'' Farrar said.
   The area to be inspected is the top of the fuselage. In the
Aloha jet, a huge upper section of the 737-200 tore away, leaving
passengers exposed to the open skies and forcing the pilot to make
an emergency landing.
   Farrar said that at altitudes of 23,000 feet or below, the
pressure between the outside and inside of the aircraft is such
that a structural weakness would not cause a failure or damage to
the plane.
   Farrar originally said that all 66 affected jets belonged to
U.S. carriers. However, he later said that about half of the jets
belonged to international airlines. He said the FAA did not know
which ones.
   Tom Cole, a Boeing spokesman in Seattle, said Boeing also did
not know which international carriers flew the affected 737s. He
said the company would try to find that out Monday.
   A Piedmont Airlines spokesman, Bill Kress, said from
Winston-Salem, N.C., that the airline had already begun inspecting
the 17 affected 737-200s in its fleet. He said such inspections
were part of the airline's regular maintenance program for the jets
and the order would have ``virtually no effect on our operation.''
   ``The aircraft is such that we use it on short hauls anyhow and
we don't need to attain that altitude of 23,000 feet,'' he said.
   In Hawaii, Aloha spokesman Milton Goto said he hadn't heard of
the FAA order and had no immediate comment. Aloha has three jets
affected by the FAA order, in addition to the one involved in the
accident, according to Boeing.
   American Airlines said 16 of its 737s were affected by the FAA
order, and those are used on short-haul West Coast routes that do
not require flying above 23,000 feet. Spokesman Steve McGregor said
from Dallas that the airline would inspect those planes within 48
hours.
   McGregor called the FAA action ``prudent,'' and said, ``We're
going to comply with it more quickly than required. We're simply
going to do it as quickly as we can.''
   Last October 5, the FAA ordered close inspection of the upper
skin of the early model Boeing 737s because routine inspections had
turned up cracks near where sections of sheet metal overlap. The
agency warned the problem could cause rapid cabin decompression.
   The inspections also found metal strips on the fuselage coming
loose on some early-model Boeing 737s because the lamination was no
longer holding.
   The earlier FAA directive covered the first 291 Boeing 737s
manufactured, of which the Aloha plane was No. 152. It had been in
service since 1969.
   Aloha Airlines has said it conducted the inspections in October
as ordered but found nothing that caused alarm.
   Boeing spokesman Jim Boynton said Friday in Seattle the company
has issued service bulletins on the need for periodic inspections
for possible cracking or structural weakening because of corrosion
of the skin of the older Boeing 737s.
   Boynton said the company's most recent bulletin had been issued
two weeks before Thursday's incident.
   Farrar said Saturday's directive was broader than the one issued
in October because the new directive orders visual inspections of
the entire top of the fuselage. He said the order will probably
mean an increase in fuel costs for the airlines because the higher
a jet flies, te more fuel-efficient it is.
   National Transportation Safety Board member Joseph T. Nall said
Friday that investigators believed the cause of the Aloha accident
was a structural problem with the Aloha jet.
   He also said the jet had been through 85,000 to 90,000
takeoff-and-landing cycles, and called that ``a high cycle number''
because of the stress caused by repeated expansions and
contractions of the fuselage.
   Earlier, Boeing asked for inspection of all Boeing 737-200 jets
that have completed more than 55,000 takeoff and landing cycles.
Meanwhile, Aloha grounded three jets similar in age to the one
involved in Thursday's accident.

   A passenger on the Aloha Airlines jet that blew
open in flight took dramatic photographs of the pilot and co-pilot
assisting passengers after the plane's precarious but safe
emergency landing.
   Robert Nichols, 61, of Kailua, Hawaii, was carrying a camera for
business use Thursday on the flight from Hilo, on Hawaii Island, to
Honolulu. Nichols, an executive of Tropical Rent-A-Car, said he had
inspected and photographed a building under construction in Hilo
that morning.
   Nichols said that when he saw the upper fuselage of the Boeing
737 blow away, he took a piece of paper from a magazine and began
writing.
   ``I didn't know how long I had,'' said Nichols, but he started
keeping a log, pouring out his heart to his wife, Jan, for what he
was sure was the last time.
   Nichols was uninjured, but after the plane's emergency landing
at Kahului Airport, he was held overnight at Maui Memorial Hospital
because he is recovering from a heart attack.
   Nichols said he was director of Pan American World Airways'
training school for flight attendants for 30 years, and had high
praise for the actions of the flight attendants.
   Nichols said he met his wife 40 years ago on his first flight as
a Pan Am steward.

   Prosecutors at the trial of alleged
drug lord Carlos Lehder Rivas produced more than 100 witnesses over
22 weeks to show that he operated a multimillion-dollar smuggling
business centered on the Bahamas.
   While the prosecution tried to draw a noose around Lehder, it
also presented evidence of the key role of the Bahamas island
chain, and a federal grand jury reportedly is looking into the
activities of Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.
   Lehder, 38, is accused of conspiring to smuggle 3.3 tons of
cocaine into the United States through his private island in the
Bahamas, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.
   The Colombian is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine
with intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operation of
a continuing criminal enterprise. His co-defendant, Jack Carlton
Reed, 57, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged only with conspiracy.
   The prosecution rested its case against the two Thursday. The
defense is expected to begin Monday and to last at least two weeks.
   ``The issue in this case is not whether Mr. Lehder was a drug
smuggler but whether Mr. Lehder as an individual committed the 11
crimes charged,'' Ed Shohat, one of Lehder's attorneys, said last
week.
   When the jury selection started in October, attorneys said they
expected the trial to last from six weeks to three months. But,
counting jury selection and a two-week Christmas recess, the trial
has ended its 30th week.
   ``Carlos Lehder pursued a singular dream, a singular vision: to
be the king of cocaine transportation,'' U.S. Attorney Robert
Merkle said in his opening statement in mid-November. ``He was to
cocaine transportation what Henry Ford was to cars.''
   While in federal prison during the 1970s, Lehder began hatching
his plans to form a cocaine-smuggling empire, prosecutors said.
   The Colombian first began smuggling small amounts of the drug
inside the lining of suitcases, using young women as couriers,
according to testimony. The smuggling, witnesses testified, became
bolder as time progressed.
   Key prosecution witness Ed Ward, an admitted smuggler, described
Norman's Cay, about 45 miles southeast of Nassau, as the perfect
transshipment point. The island was sparsely populated, had a
3,000-foot airstrip and no police or customs officials.
   Ward testified that he flew 10 loads of Colombian cocaine into
the United States for Lehder, whom he met in 1979.
   The trial also has touched on alleged payoffs to Bahamian
officials, including allegations from numerous witnesses that
Pindling filled his pockets with bribes from smugglers such as
Lehder.
   Ward testified that he gave former Bahamian Agriculture Minister
George Smith $100,000 that was ``supposed to go directly to the
prime minister, Prime Minister Pindling.''
   Law enforcement sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that Merkle has been presenting evidence about Pindling to a
federal grand jury in Tampa, including reams of material first
presented at the Lehder trial.
   Other news reports have said that the grand jury investigation
was located in Miami or Jacksonville, rather than Tampa.
   Merkle, when asked last week about whether a grand jury was
investigating Pindling, said, ``I can't comment on that.''
   Pindling's name has frequently been mentioned in relation to
drug investigations, but in 1984, a royal commission of inquiry in
the Bahamas found that Pindling had more money than known income,
but none of that appeared to be drug-related.
   Pindling won re-election a year ago by invoking the fear common
to small nations in this hemisphere that the United States is
meddling in their affairs.
   Bill Kalis, Pindling's spokesman in Nassau, said Friday he had
heard reports of grand jury investigations in Miami or
Jacksonville, but that Pindling didn't expect to be indicted.
   ``Most of the testimony at the Lehder trial is recycled from the
commission of inquiry,'' Kalis said. He added that the grand jury
``might be hearing some of the same plea-bargaining witnesses that
are appearing at the Lehder trial.'' Much of the testimony in the
trial has come from convicted drug smugglers granted immunity from
prosecution or awaiting sentencing.
   At one point in Lehder's trial, defense attorneys reminded
prosecutors and jurors that Pindling was not on trial.
   But in his opening statement, Merkle had told jurors, ``You also
will hear evidence that Carlos Lehder was making payoffs directly
the prime minister of the Bahamas, still the prime minister now,
Lynden Pindling.''
   Lehder is also charged in separate indictments in Los Angeles
and Miami.
   The Miami indictment accuses him of being one of the leaders of
the so-called Medellin Cartel, believed to be responsible for 80
percent of the cocaine smuggled into United States _ a drug
operation worth $8 billion each year.

   The government on Saturday ordered an NBC
television correspondent to leave the country after he reported
that Jordan has a ``tightly controlled and at times even repressive
society.''
   Correspondent Rick Davis, one of only a small number of American
television correspondents based in Arab countries, was given a week
to leave Jordan.
   Information Minister Hani Hassawneh said Davis' feature about
Jordan on NBC's ``Sunday Today'' was ``clearly against the
country.''
   He also accused the correspondent of ``breaking the ethics of
reporting'' by complaining about security and Information Ministry
officials.
   Davis said NBC would protest the government action, but he said
he could not comment further until consulting with the network
headquarters in New York. Davis, who has worked for NBC for 13
years, has reported on the Middle East since 1979 and has been
based in Jordan since March 1985.
   In New York, Lawrence K. Grossman, president of NBC News, issued
a statement addressed to King Hussein. It said:
   ``Your majesty, we protest in the strongest possible terms the
expulsion of NBC News correspondent Rick Davis from the kingdom of
Jordan. Mr. Davis, the only American television network
correspondent stationed in an Arab country, is a veteran reporter
who has been ably covering Jordan and the Middle East continually
for the past three years. His journalistic efforts have been widely
recognized as being fair, insightful, authoritative and
intelligent. It is indeed shameful that Jordan has now joined
Israel in denying press credentials to a distinguished and expert
NBC news corresponsdent stationed within its borders.''
   Mary Lou O'Callahan, director of news information for NBC, said
Jordanian Information Ministry officials indicated the network
could replace Davis, but no decision has been made by NBC.
   The action against Davis came four days after neighboring
Israel, technically at war with Jordan, suspended the press
credentials of NBC correspondent Martin Fletcher and Washington
Post reporter Glenn Frankel.
   Israel said they violated censorship rules by failing to submit
for clearance stories alleging that Israel was behind the
assassination in Tunisia of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir.
   In his profile of Jordan, Davis referred to Jordan as ``tightly
controlled and at times even repressive society.'' He noted that
the headquarters of the ``not-so-secret police'' is sometimes
termed ``the Palestinian hotel'' because of the Palestinian
activists often imprisoned there.
   The program also included a clip of radical Palestinian leader
George Habash accusing King Hussein of a ``barbarous massacre'' of
Palestinian civilians during the Black September fighting between
the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Jordanian army in
1970. Thousands of people died.
   Hassawneh said the program ``insulted King Abdullah,'' Jordan's
first ruler and grandfather of King Hussein, by saying the British
appointed Abdullah emir when Jordan was created as a British
protectorate after World War I.
   ``It was very clear to us he was a very biased man,'' Hassawneh
said.
   American networks once kept correspondents in Beirut, Lebanon,
to cover the Arab world, but pulled them out after journalists
became targets of kidnappers in 1985 and 1986.
   They now rely largely on term-contract journalists and
free-lancers based in Egypt, Lebanon and other Arab countries, and
they send in Europe-based staff correspondents for major stories.
   
   Journalists rarely have been expelled from Jordan in recent
years, although the Information Ministry in 1986 blacklisted two
Israel-based Western reporters for stories about Jordanian
suppression of demonstrations.
   King Hussein quickly lifted those bans.

   One man was shot to death, two men suffered
gunshot wounds and a fourth victim was clubbed over the head in two
separate incidents of apparent gang-related violence Saturday,
authorities said.
   Eduardo Morales, 18, and Mario Macias, 20, were shot early
Saturday by two suspected gang members on bicycles while they sat
in the back seat of a car parked in suburban Lynwood, said Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Roop.
   Morales was hit in the chest and abdomen and was pronounced dead
at St. Francis Medical Center. Macias was wounded in the left
buttock and was listed in stable condition, Roop said.
   In East Los Angeles, a man was shot and wounded and a teen-ager
was hit on the head with a baseball bat during a gang fight.
   John Mendez, 28, was in serious condition at County-USC Medical
Center with a gunshot wound in the chest and Derrick Parra, 16, was
treated for the clubbing injury and released, said hospital
spokeswoman Adelaida De La Cerda.
   Mendez and Parra and two or three other companions were involved
in a brawl with three men and a teen-ager, said sheriff's Deputy
Gabe Ramirez.
   Parra was hit on the head with a baseball bat and then helped by
his companions into a pickup truck, Ramirez said. They fled with
the other group in pursuit and then crashed a short distance away,
Ramirez said.
   Mendez was shot by one member of the pursuing group, and another
man fired four shots with the same gun but missed, Ramirez said.
Mendez's companions escaped.
   Robert Espinoza, 20, who allegedly fired the first shot, and
Luis Delvillar, 23, who allegedly fired the other shots, were
arrested for investigation of attempted murder, Ramirez said.
   Armando Delvillar, 22, and a 16-year-old boy who was not
identified were arrested for investigation of assault with a deadly
weapon.
   Police recovered a .38-caliber, five-shot revolver, Ramirez said.
   There were 387 gang-related slayings recorded in Los Angeles
County in 1987. The Los Angeles Police Department has begun
conducting sweeps of gang areas in recent weeks to try to curb the
violence.

   Two small earthquakes rattled Southern
California Saturday, one an aftershock of the destructive Oct. 1
Whittier Narrows temblor and the other near the Mexican border,
authorities said.
   The aftershock measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale hit at 11:40
a.m., said Robert Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   Its epicenter was placed four miles southeast of Pasadena on the
fault that produced the October quake, which caused millions of
dollars in damage.
   A quake measuring 3.0 on the Richter scale hit just before 9
a.m. about 12 miles southeast of downtown San Diego, Finn said.
   No injuries or damage were reported in either quake, sheriff's
deputies said.
   Quakes with a Richter reading of less than 3.5 can cause slight
damage in a local area.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.

<TEXT>
   Some 10,000 union members and civil rights
activists rallied Saturday to demand jobs with better pay and
better benefits.
   ``People aren't poor because they don't have jobs, but because
of the low pay for the jobs they've got,'' Texas Commissioner of
Agriculture Jim Hightower told the crowd.
   The rally in the Atlanta Civic Center parking lot marked the end
of a four-state ``pilgrimage for economic justice'' by the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference.
   The journey began in Memphis, Tenn., on April 4, 20 years after
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in that city.
   The pilgrimage demonstrated the ``rebirth of the coalition of
labor unions and civil rights workers seeking full employment with
decent wages,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the SCLC,
which King founded. ``The current minimum wage ($3.35 an hour) just
won't do it.''
   ``We have come to protest the policies that have turned the
world's mightiest industrial power into a declining nation,'' said
Bernice King, daughter of the slain civil rights leader.
   Speakers assailed Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air Corp.,
who has been demanding concessions from unionized employees of the
company's Eastern Airlines unit.
   ``While he is demanding a 60 percent cut in your wages, he is
banking one-half million dollars in wages and benefits,'' said
Hightower. ``He is saying he is the top dog and you're a bunch of
fire hydrants.''
   John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees
International Union, lashed out at Atlanta developer John Portman,
who he claimed is vigorously opposing efforts to unionize janitors
at buildings Portman owns.
   ``When you're a janitor making $3.35 an hour with no benefits,
you're forced to subsist with the help of the taxpayer,'' Sweeney
said. Working people ``are subsidizing the owners of these big,
downtown buildings,'' he added.
   Lowery saw several contrasts between April's SCLC march and
civil rights marches in the 1960s, including the presence this time
of many black elected officials and greater police support.
   ``The blue lights were warm and welcoming,'' he said of police
escorts marchers received in parts of Mississippi and Alabama. ``In
the '60s, the lights were hostile and forboding.''
   Drugs joined poverty as a theme in the latest march, Lowery said.
   ``We're calling the drug pushers the new lynch mob, and they're
much more threatening than the old lynch mob,'' he said.
   Elsewhere Saturday, a crowd estimated at up to 10,000 people
staged a leisurely demonstration in San Francisco for more U.S.
jobs, arms control and changes in policies toward Central America
and South Africa.

   A Socialist International
committee on Saturday criticized U.S. efforts to oust Panama's
strongman Gen. Manuel Noriega, saying only the Panamanian people
are suffering.
   The Reagan administration's economic sanctions against Panama
``not only violate the non-intervention principle, but also are
only causing suffering to the Panamanian people,'' the Socialist
International Commitee for Latin America and the Caribbean said in
a declaration.
   The committee said the only solution for Panama's crisis should
be negotiations between the government and the opposition ``to
guarantee free elections, a definitive role for the Defense Forces
and independence for the civilian power.''
   Noriega is commander of the 15,000-member Defense Forces and
controls the civilian government.
   The declaration was approved after a two-day meeting in Rio of
Socialist International delegates from 20 organizations in Latin
America and the Caribbean. Observers from the United States and
Europe also attended.
   The main topics on the agenda included the advancement and
strengthening of democracy in South America, the peace process in
Central America and the future of democracy and development in the
Caribbean.
   A report with the committee's conclusions will be presented to
the Socialist International World Council meeting to be held May
11-12 in Madrid, Spain.

   An epidemic of meningitis in central
and western Africa has affected thousands of people and killed
hundreds, but vaccination programs are controlling the spread,
according to a United Nations agency.
   A UNICEF report was obtained Saturday by The Associated Press.
   It said that in Chad, 4,211 cases of the disease, including 400
deaths, were reported as of Wednesday.
   The epidemic has ended in the capital, Ndjamena, but was
continuing in Chad's northern desert regions, the report said.
   It said more than 800,000 Chadians have been vaccinated, with
coverage in the capital reaching 95 percent.
   On Friday, Chad's southern neighbor, Cameroon, reported 300
cases of meningitis with 40 deaths in its northernmost province.
Cameroon radio said the epidemic was spread by people entering
Cameroon from Chad.
   UNICEF also reported 372 cases of meningitis and 58 deaths in
the west African country of Benin and said a vaccination campaign
was under way.
   Benin's northern neighbors, Burkina Faso and Niger, also are
affected, the report said.
   Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the
brain and spinal cord as the result of infection by bacteria or
viruses.

   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson
stepped up criticism of Michael Dukakis Saturday, saying the
Massachusetts governor fails to offer a clear alternative to
Republican policies.
   Jackson avoided saying directly that Dukakis would be like a
Republican, but he told a labor forum in Cleveland, ``Democrats
must be the alternative. We do not need two Republican parties in
America.''
   Jackson was asked by reporters if he meant to say that Dukakis
would pull Democrats toward Republican policies.
   ``I would not put him in that category,'' he said. ``There are
some in the Democratic Party who would pull our party toward
conservatism.''
   He then gave a litany of issues on which he thinks Dukakis has
not presented a strong commitment or budgetary priority for change:
childcare, southern Africa, education, drugs.
   It was clear as Jackson campaigned in search of votes for
Tuesday's primary in Ohio that he wants to cast Dukakis as a weaker
voice against Reagan policies than his own.
   Jackson also spoke repeatedly of the importance of having
leaders who can inspire, an apparent effort to showcase himself as
an inspirational candidate in contrast to Dukakis' low-key demeanor
that many find dull.
   Jackson drew repeated applause in the hall full of unionists as
he focused on labor issues and called himself a ``working people's
person.''
   At a speech at the University of Dayton gymnasium, Jackson
continued to suggest that Dukakis was a managerial candidate, while
he is a leader. He said attainment of peace in the world and
changing President Reagan's economic policy requires leadership,
not management.
   ``To end Reaganomics we need a leader. We need to change the
course,'' Jackson told the cheering, racially mixed crowd. ``To
find peace in the Middle East, we must have leadership. We cannot
manage apartheid, We must end apartheid.''
   In the Cleveland appearance and later at a Columbus rally,
Jackson tried to put a damper on Dukakis' ``Massachusetts miracle''
of economic recovery during his tenure as governor.
   ``Even in Massachusetts, Massachusetts lost 11 percent of its
manufacturing jobs since 1984,'' Jackson said.
   He said however that ``It's not the fault of Governor Dukakis.
It's the fault of Reaganomics.''
   ``The best of governors are not a substitute for a president who
leads,'' he said.
   He then added in a two-sided comment, ``Don't blame Mr. Dukakis
because union membership has plummetted.''
   The Dukakis campaign cites an increase of 400,000 jobs in
Massachusetts during nine years under Dukakis.
   But Jackson contended, ``Sure there are more jobs. More jobs,
less wages.''
   He told reporters that if other states had received the
contracts for research and development that Massachusetts had
received, they too would be economically prospering and that ``a
combination of circumstances'' contributed to Massachusetts'
success.
   He continued to say Dukakis has shown no commitment to reverse
President Reagan's economic policies but would only ``manage
Reaganomics.''
   He ridiculed Dukakis for offering only $250 million in new
education spending saying, ``You cannot educate every child in
America to go to college on only $250 million.''
   ``We need a massive commitment to invest in people, reinvest in
America and end Reaganomics,'' Jackson told the Columbus rally of
about 1,500 people organized by churches and labor groups.
   He also accused both Dukakis and Vice President George Bush, the
likely GOP nominee, of failing to show their priorities by setting
out a budget.
   On one of Jackson's primary campaign themes _ increasing taxes
on corporations, including those that escape taxation through
loopholes _ he referred to Dukakis' proposal to raise revenue by
stepping up enforcement on uncollected taxes.
   ``It's not about uncollected taxes. It's exempted taxes, and
unregulated behavior of corporate baracudas,'' he said.

Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge says he'll ignore federal
sentencing guidelines on the ground they violate the U.S.
Constitution's separation of powers.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Shoob, ruling Friday in the case of
two people convicted of a December bank robbery, said he intended
to sentence them as though their crimes had occurred before
November, when the sentencing guidelines went into effect.
   The guidelines, intended to remedy disparities between the
sentences handed down by federal judges across the country, require
them to follow a schedule of mandatory sentences.
   The guidelines, Shoob ruled, ``are not simply guideposts to aid
the exercise of judicial discretion.... They reduce the role of
sentencing judges to filling in the blanks and applying a rigid,
mechanical formula.''
   Shoob said the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which produced the
guidelines, was acting ``in place of the judge.''
   He also held unconstitutional the commission itself, required by
law to include three federal judges and four non-judiciary members,
all appointed by the president.
   ``Mandatory service of judges on the commission violates the
doctrine of separation of powers,'' Shoob said.
   ``Constitutional separation of powers,'' Shoob said, ``is so
fundamental to our governmental system that every schoolchild
learns about our system of checks and balances.''
   Shoob's ruling was almost certain to be appealed because of the
constitutional question it raises.
   Shoob also has challenged federal officials over treatment of
Cuban refugees jailed in the Atlanta federal penitentiary, saying
they were being held unfairly.

<HEAD>Two Underground Solidarity Leaders Leave For Rome</HEAD>

   Two former underground Solidarity leaders
were released from prison Saturday and flew to Rome after initially
refusing to leave the country.
   Kornel Morawiecki, 46, and Andrzej Kolodziej, 28, were put on a
plane to Vienna, Austria, and arrived in Rome Saturday night.
   The communist government released the two men from Warsaw's
Rakowiecka prison Saturday in a deal with Roman Catholic church
officials.
   Morawiecki and Kolodziej had been driven to Warsaw's airport to
board a flight for Rome, but the two refused to leave after meeting
with family members at the airport.
   The two were then taken back to the prison but agreed to leave
the country after more talks at the prison involving church
officials.
   One of Morawiecki's daughters, Marta, said the two men were told
they could either leave together or remain imprisoned. She said
medical reasons played a role in the decision to leave.
   The two were given multiple exit-and-entry passports and were
expected to undergo medical treatment in Rome. Both apparently are
suffering from ulcers and other medical problems.
   Morawiecki, who was arrested Nov. 9, 1987, was chairman of the
militant splinter group Fighting Solidarity.
   He went underground after martial law was declared in December
1981 and the Solidarity union federation was suspended and
subsequently outlawed. In 1982, he formed Fighting Solidarity,
which differs from Solidarity because it advocates anti-communist
political goals. Solidarity emphasizes social and union issues.
   Kolodziej headed Fighting Solidarity from the time of
Morawiecki's arrest until his own capture in January. He had been
in hiding since 1985.
   A third, less prominent Fighting Solidarity activist, Krzystof
Szymanski, also was released Saturday.
   Morawiecki's elder daughter, Anna, said Morawiecki and Kolodziej
had agreed to leave the country in a deal worked out by church
officials. But after family members at the airport told them about
new strikes in the country, they decided to stay.
   Asked to explain what finally prompted the two men to leave,
Marta Morawiecki said, ``We cannot give you a full explanation.
There were very important arguments and they both finally agreed to
go.''
   ``There were some personal reasons which had to be taken into
account, also a serious danger to Kolodziej's health,'' she said.
   Ewa Maria Stoja, Kolodziej's girlfriend, said official documents
indicated the two men were being released at the recommendation of
a commission of prison doctors ``due to the required urgent medical
examination, which may also take place abroad.''
   She said Kolodziej suffered from ulcers and teeth problems,
while Morawiecki had ulcer symptoms, poor eyesight and heart and
kidney problems.
   Morawiecki, speaking with reporters in Rome, said he and
Kolodziej at first did not want to leave Poland because they were
not told why they were being sent to the West. He said the issue
was settled after they spoke with a secretary of the Polish
Episcopal Conference, Aloizj Orszulik.
   ``We decided to leave for three reasons,'' he said. ``First the
medical diagnosis'' that Koldziej might have a tumor, ``secondly
the possibility that it might be more difficult in the future for
the Polish church to perform these humanitarian acts if we refused,
and lastly the assurance that we would be allowed to return
whenever we choose.''
   Morawiecki said that while in prison he was never told anything
about what was happening in the country.
   ``I only learned something today,'' he said. ``There is an
agitation going on that reminds me of August of 1980. ... I believe
this pressure will increase and I hope it might lead to a change in
government.''
   In August 1980, nationwide strikes led to the creation of
Solidarity. It was chartered by the government and became the first
independent union federation in the Soviet bloc but was banned
after the December 1981 crackdown.
   Authorities alleged that Morawiecki and Kolodziej were part of a
ring that attempted to smuggle equipment intended for terrorist use
from Sweden. They were never formally charged.
   In a statement in November, Kolodziej denied the allegations.
   In September 1986, the communist government issued a broad
amnesty for political prisoners. Since then, all political
activists jailed have been held on criminal charges.
   In another development, Jan Andrzej Gorny, the Solidarity leader
in the southern Silesian industrial region was released after an
appeals court on Friday suspended his sentence, Solidarity sources
said.
   Gorny was serving an 18-month sentence at a prison in Katowice
after being convicted of failing to pay alimony and using false
identity cards. He staged a hunger strike in February to protest
against his sentence.

   Strikers occupying a machinery plant in
southeast Poland ended their sit-in Saturday after apparently
winning promises of higher pay, but a walkout by thousands of steel
workers persisted with no end in sight.
   The developments came as the Polish government prepared for its
big May Day celebrations. Solidarity, the banned trade union
federation, called for nationwide protests to mark the nation's
biggest official holiday.
   In the history of the communist government, there has never been
a large-scale strike in progress on May Day.
   Strike leaders said dozens of police vans and vehicles including
water cannons moved into positions near the Lenin steel mill in
Nowa Huta late Saturday. There were also large numbers of police in
other parts of Krakow and in Warsaw in an apparent show of strength
before May Day.
   More than 40 opposition activists were rounded up by police to
prevent them from taking part in the holiday protests, said
Zbigniew Romaszewski, a Warsaw Solidarity spokesman.
   One of Poland's senior anti-government activists, Kornel
Morawiecki, founder of the splinter dissident group Fighting
Solidarity, was freed from prison nearly six months after his
arrest through apparent negotiations by the country's powerful
Roman Catholic church.
   Morawiecki was freed with Andrzej Kolodziej, another member of
Fighting Solidarity.
   The two men were flown to Rome after initially refusing to leave.
   A strike by what organizers said was about 15,000 workers at the
Lenin steel mill in Nowa Huta outside Krakow entered its fifth day
with no sign of a breakthrough.
   The 7,000 striking workers occupying a heavy machinery plant at
Stalowa Wola, about 150 miles southeast of Warsaw, left the factory
Saturday at about 2 p.m. after management agreed to their pay
demands, said Grzegorz Surdy, a spokesman for the strikers.
   The Rev. Jan Niemiec, a Roman Catholic priest in Stalowa Wola,
said the strikers received nothing in writing but that their
demands were expected to be met.
   The state-run news agency PAP also reported the one-day strike
ended but denied there were any negotiations with the strikers.
   ``In view of the illegal character of the protest action, no
negotiations had been held with the striking group,'' the report
said.
   The labor crisis began Monday and is the most serious to
confront Poland since the December 1981 declaration of martial law
and the banning of Solidarity.
   In a positive development for the government, Krakow's tram
drivers ignored a Solidarity call for a strike Saturday.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was to address the nation
during the May Day celebration in the capital of Warsaw, which was
festooned with banners, red party flags and red-and-white national
colors in the country's biggest official holiday.
   The holiday is dedicated to working people and in recent years
has been an occasion for sometimes violent protests for Solidarity.
   Surdy, a student and twice-jailed Solidarity activist, said
Saturday he was surprised that authorities had not attempted to
stop the Nowa Huta strike before the holiday.
   In a communique issued through the Polish news agency
Interpress, the plant management said that as of Saturday, it would
begin docking strikers' pay and would close down restaurants and
snack bars on the plant grounds.
   In an apparent hardening of the positions of strikers, three
fired Solidarity activists _ including Mieczyslaw Gil, the former
head of the Solidarity at the plant _ were named to the strike
committee.
   One of the committee's demands is that the three be rehired.
   Unlike Poland's last wave of labor unrest in 1980-81, which gave
rise to Solidarity, the workers did not cover the plant with
banners or mix political and economic demands.
   Photographs taken in work areas inside the plant showed workers
reading newsapers, sleeping or talking on the telephone.
   After four days of the strike ``there is weariness and already a
little boredom,'' Surdy said, but he emphasized that workers
intended to stay off the jobs ``until our demands are met.''
   Besides the reinstatement of the fired workers, the steel
workers are demanding an immediate 50 percent raise on the average
salary of $105 a month.
   At Stalowa Wola, where the occupation strike began Friday, the
demands included a $50 monthly raise, reinstatement of coal
allowances and release and rehiring of three other dismissed
Solidarity activists.
   Church sources said earlier Saturday that one of the Solidarity
activists had been freed from detention.
   Solidarity last month urged that May 1 be ``a day of protest''
against the nationwide price increases that have raised prices 42
percent in the first three months of 1988.
   Union activists applied for permission to march Sunday in Warsaw
but were turned down.
   However, opposiiton sources said the march was planned anyway.

   The fault-riddled rock layers under
the Nevada desert blur and diminish shock waves from underground
explosions, but weekend tests showed cheating under a nuclear test
ban still could be detected, scientists said.
   Experiments using buried charges of conventional explosive and a
network of sensitive instruments proved that even the smallest
explosions can be monitored, said research geophysicist Holly
Eissler.
   Ms. Eissler, of the University of California San Diego, was part
of a team from the Natural Resources Defense Council that set up
modified earthquake-monitoring equipment to record shock waves from
three detonations of TNT in remote areas of Nevada Friday and
Saturday.
   The third and largest test Saturday showed clearly on seismic
equipment here, producing cheers from scientists. The first test
Friday was less obvious and a second one later Friday showed up on
only the most sophisticated instruments, Ms. Eissler said.
   ``The experiment is successful,'' Charles Archambeau, a
University of Colorado-Boulder geophysics professor, said after
seismometers detected the first detonation of 10 tons of TNT on
Friday.
   ``It means that we can more accurately gauge the numbers and
distribution of stations that will be required to verify a
low-threshold treaty. It also will help us to set the threshold of
what's verifiable,'' he said.
   Archambeau heads the seismic monitoring advisory committee of
the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group conducting
the experiments in this country and the Soviet Union in cooperation
with the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   Following the explosion of 10 tons of TNT buried beneath the
desert 100 miles north of Reno and another 10-ton shot 50 miles
south of the Nevada Test Site on Friday, a 15-ton detonation was
set off Saturday about 100 miles east of Carson City and 210 miles
northeast of Deep Springs.
   The blasts were monitored by Soviet and American equipment here
in the Sierra Nevada about midway between Reno and Las Vegas and at
two permanent Defense Council installations closer to the Nevada
Test Site 110 miles north of Las Vegas, where all U.S. underground
nuclear detonations are conducted. An additional 140 temporary
monitoring stations were set up across Nevada.
   Experiments similar to this weekend's were conducted by the
Soviet and American scientists last September near the Soviet test
site in Kazakhstan.
   Because of the geology of the Soviet Union, the readings there
were much more pronounced than those so far in the fractured
foundations of Nevada.
   ``It was a very small signal, but it was a discernible signal,''
Ms. Eissler said of Friday's first test. She noted that a limited
nuclear test ban treaty passed Thursday by the House forbids
detonations larger than one kiloton, 100 times the strength of the
10-ton TNT blast.
   She said Friday's first test was recorded here at about three
times normal background noise, and the second explosion was barely
detectable.
   Saturday's larger explosion registered about 10 times background
noise, Ms. Eissler said.
   The scientists initially thought Friday's first detonation
failed to register on any of the seismic monitors, but a more
detailed study indicated the test was recorded successfully 100
seconds after the blast.
   ``This is about the size we'd expect in this terrain,''
Archambeau said. He called Nevada's complex geology ``a worst-case
situation (that) will help us design networks that can do
verification in these rather difficult areas.''
   The experiments are expected to show that ``any chances for
cheating are about excluded'' under a test ban, said Evgeni
Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy and an adviser to
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``We think the comprehensive test ban is very important,'' he
added. ``It is extremely important to stop the arms race.''
   The testing equipment was designed ``to feel the difference
between nuclear and industrial explosions and ... very small
earthquakes,'' according to Thomas Cochran, senior staff scientist
for the Defense Council.

   Democrat Michael Dukakis responded to
criticism from Republican George Bush on Saturday, saying ``I think
maybe it's time for him to stop criticizing others,'' and defended
his leadership ability against rival Jesse Jackson's sharpened
charges.
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential front-runner, answered the
increasing criticism from his competitors only when questioned by
reporters. He had avoided any mention of his rivals during a day of
campaigning in two states.
   The Massachusetts governor pointed to his state's economic
record in trying to deflect Jackson's suggestion that Dukakis was
offering only a managerial approach to governing and lacked the
leadership abilities that he provides.
   ``When it comes to leadership, I'm very proud of the fact that
I'm governor of a state which is generally viewed to be a state
that's way out front,'' Dukakis said. ``My kind of leadership is as
a doer, and not a talker.''
   Dukakis has also come under fire from Bush, who a day earlier
charged Dukakis with ``waffling all over the field'' in his
reaction to the administration's decision to attack Iranian
positions in the Persian Gulf. He was asked about Bush's comments
that he has ``cannon fodder'' to use against Dukakis in the fall,
suggesting it was some unknown evidence from the governor's
administration in Massachusetts.
   ``I really don't think the American people are interested in
what George Bush thinks of me and I think of him and whether he's
got cannon fodder or whatever it is that he's got,'' Dukakis said.
   ``I think maybe it's time for him to stop criticizing others and
to begin to address some fundamental issues that face this
country,'' Dukakis said.
   Running with a big delegate lead and confident of his standing
in the remaining primaries, Dukakis has campaigned cautiously and
strived to avoid the suggestion of acrimony.
   His campaign schedule has been carried out in a manner that has
limited his availability to take questions, while he has delivered
speeches repeating familiar themes and exhorting supporters not to
become overconfident.
   Earlier in Ohio, Dukakis told supporters they must take ``this
primary seriously.''
   The Massachusetts governor took an early morning stroll through
an outdoor fruit market in downtown Cincinnati and later spoke to
union members at a half-empty labor hall in Cleveland less than an
hour after Jackson received an enthusiastic response for his speech
before the same group.
   Dukakis also spoke to a largely black group in Cleveland. He
criticized the Reagan administration's anti-drug efforts and told
them his aim was ``to open up that door of opportunity to all
citizens, no matter who they are or where they come from or what
the color of their skin.''
   ``That's really what this campaign is all about,'' he said.
   He traveled to Indianapolis where he attended the state
Democratic Party's annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner and planned to
visit a high school prom where aides said he would deliver a
message on the dangers of drinking and driving.
   With a large and growing lead in delegates over Jackson, and a
primary calender strongly in his favor, Dukakis has been urging
supporters at every stop to ignore the polls and work to produce a
large turnout.
   Standing amid new sofas and tables on the loading dock of a
Cincinnati furniture store, Dukakis spoke optimistically of winning
the nomination but also urged them not to become complacent.
   ``I want to ask you once again to do everything you can, on
those phone banks, in your neighborhoods, with your friends and
co-workers, to make sure the people are taking this primary
seriously, that they know it is important,'' he said.
   ``If we work together ... we're going to win in Ohio, we're
going to win in Indiana ... and we're going to win this
nomination,'' he said.
   In urging his voters to turn out on Tuesday, Dukakis repeatedly
referred to his own 1978 re-election defeat in Massachusetts
despite a one-time lead in the polls.
   ``It was the most painful experience of my life,'' he told union
members in Cleveland.
   He compared the experience to being a worker laid off from his
job, although he added that in his case it was his own fault. ``I
know what it's like,'' he said.

   Times are good for cable television. It has
become a $12 billion industry whose programming is watched in more
than half of all American households, and subscribership is
continuing to grow.
   But the industry is also wary of how long this prosperity will
last.
   Cable TV is no longer a highly regulated industry weighted down
with debt from stringing cable to build community systems. Most of
the systems are built and cable operators have more control than
ever over what viewers see and how much they pay.
   ``It's a very healthy industry; it's never been healthier,''
said Edward Hatch, a media analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets in New York. ``Life is good in the cable industry right
now.''
   But some in Congress think it may be too good. Lawmakers,
prompted by complaints from constituents about rate increases and
poor service and the competitive concerns of others in the
entertainment industry, have raised the specter of reregulating the
cable industry.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, fired a warning shot at the
industry at a congressional hearing in March, saying ``some of us
feel we were had'' by a law that freed most cable companies of
municipal rate control in January 1987. He and other lawmakers
wonder aloud whether cable has become an unregulated monopoly.
   The threat from Capitol Hill ``is a concern you can't ignore,''
Hatch said, and this and other regulatory issues are on the minds
of cable operators attending their industry's annual convention
here this week.
   More than 13,000 people were expected to attend the National
Cable Television Association convention, which runs from Sunday
through Tuesday.
   Cable TV systems added more than 4 million subscribers in 1987,
putting the households receiving cable at 51 percent _ about 45
million.
   Now that many of cable operators have finished building their
systems _ wiring more than 80 percent of American households _
cable companies are beginning to pay off their debt and have cash
to spend on programming.
   Cable is looking to programming to attract new subscribers, and
the industry is encouraged by the success of efforts like
Showtime's critically acclaimed ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' a
series that now also airs on the Fox broadcasting network.
   Home Box Office's ``Dear America: Letters Home from Vietnam''
also received high marks from TV critics, and the Entertainment and
Sports Programming Network, ESPN, has landed some big sports
contracts, including National Football League games.
   ``Things are going extraordinarily well for cable,'' said Robert
Alter, president of the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau.
``People are discovering the choice in programming that cable
offers.''
   Cable systems are adding subscribers at the rate of 1 percent to
2 percent a year, and those with the wire are spending nearly as
much time watching programming produced by cable as they do viewing
programs of the three major broadcast networks, he said.
   Increased viewership boosted cable advertising sales above the
$1 billion mark last year, and ad revenues are expected to hit $1.5
billion this year, he said. Each new subscriber is worth about
$2,000 to the asset value of many cable systems, he said.
   ``There is a tremendous incentive on cable to sharpen its
marketing skills to build its subscriber base,'' he said.
   Rates have also risen since deregulation 16 months ago, and that
has concerned Congress. Metzenbaum says prices in some systems have
risen by up to 400 percent.
   The NCTA, however, says the average cable subscriber's monthly
bill rose 6.7 percent in the first six months after deregulation.
While basic service prices rose about 10.6 percent, rates for
premium or pay channels like HBO dropped 2.5 percent, according to
the study.

   Sand breaking loose from the sides of a hopper
buried and killed a maintenance worker Saturday, authorities said.
   The unsually powdery sand, used to make molds for brake parts,
had been caked onto the sides of the hopper that Bernard Hayes, 38,
was cleaning, said Battalion Fire Chief Frank Schaper.
   It took about five hours to recover Hayes' body after the sand
caved in at 4:45 a.m. at the Warner Div.-Cooper Industries plant,
Schaper said. He said one fireman suffered a minor back injury when
he became trapped in the soft sand and was pulled out by his safety
harness.
   Authorities said two other workers escaped serious injury in the
accident.
   Company officials said the accident would be investigated.

   Actor John Hillerman is ending an eight-year
run of fooling Britons playing Jonathan Higgins, the stuffy British
major-domo who runs the estate of the perpetually absent mystery
writer Robin Masters on ``Magnum P.I.''
   ``I get a lot of fan mail from England saying, `Well done, it's

`Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm just a hick from Texas,'''
Hillerman said recently.

<HEAD>Fawn Hall, Others Reportedly Unindicted Co-Conspirators in
Iran-Contra Affair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fawn Hall, the former secretary to Oliver
North, has been named by a federal grand jury as an unindicted
co-conspirator in the Iran-Contra affair, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   Miss Hall was named along with Robert Earle, a former assistant
to North on the National Security Council staff, and Joe Fernandez,
a former CIA agent, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   The action, which has been kept under court seal, allows
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh to use the testimony of the
unindicted co-conspirators against the prosecutor's primary
targets: North, former national security adviser John Poindexter,
retired Gen. Richard Secord and Iranian-born arms dealer Albert
Hakim.
   Citing unidentified sources close to the investigation, the
Times said the move is significant because it distinguishes Miss
Hall, Earle and Fernandez from conventional witnesses whose
testimony would apply only to one defendant at a time.
   James Wieghart, a spokesman for Walsh, declined to comment on
the report Saturday in Washington.
   Miss Hall's attorney, Plato Cacheris said: ``I don't regard her
as a co-conspirator, and this is grossly unfair and incorrect.''
   North, Poindexter, Secord and Hakim were indicted on charges of
conspiring to divert Iran arms sale profits to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   Hearsay testimony from an alleged member of a conspiracy, even
if unindicted, can be used against all members of the conspiracy
because the witness was close to events, the Times said.
   Walsh has reportedly granted full immunity to Miss Hall and
Earle. Fernandez has not been granted immunity, however, and could
still face charges, sources told the Times.
   In testimony before a congressional committee last year, Miss
Hall admitted removing classified materials from the NSC offices
while she was North's personal secretary. She and Earle have
admitted shredding documents later sought in the investigation.
   Fernandez, former CIA chief of station in Costa Rica, has
acknowledged involvement in secret U.S. airdrops to the Contras at
a time when Congress had banned military aid to the rebels.
   Earle's lawyer, Dennis Dean Kirk, declined to comment. John
Stein, the attorney representing Fernandez, could not be reached
for comment.
   The process of naming unindicted co-conspirators has come under
criticism on the ground that because they are not defendants, they
do not have the opportunity to clear themselves in court.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The director of the District of Columbia's
Department of Human Services and two aides have resigned after
reports surfaced that the three used city funds to pay their rent
and food bills, officials said Saturday.
   Mayor Marion Barry Jr. demanded the resignations Friday night
after meeting with the city administrator and legal counsel,
according to John White, a spokesman for the mayor.
   Director M. Jerome Woods and Chief Deputy Theodore Carthen had
been living in an $875-a-month, two-bedroom apartment using city
housing allowance funds and receiving some reimbursements for food
since August. Steve Y'Barra and a fourth assistant, Deputy Director
Robert Little, were also found to be living off city funds.
   Little's resignation was not immediately accepted pending
determination of whether he is responsible for the housing
allowances he received.
   None has been charged with criminal wrongdoing, White said.
   City personnel regulations allow the reimbursement of housing
and food costs to out-of-town employees hired as experts if the
employees are not on a regular work schedule.
   The impropriety, however, stems from the fact that all four men
receive pay for normal 40-hour work weeks, although they maintain
residences in other states, according to White.
   Neither Woods, who assumed the position in July, nor Carthen
could be reached for comment Saturday.
   A total of 11 people, including two deputy mayors, have been
convicted of criminal wrongdoing while serving in the nine-year-old
Barry administration.

   A bomb exploded at the
headquarters of an opposition labor union Saturday, damaging the
front of the building, shattering windows and injuring a woman with
flying glass, a union leader said.
   In other developments, authorities found the bodies of six
people on a ranch near the capital and blamed the killings on
leftist guerrillas. In the eastern city of San Miguel a university
official said soldiers destroyed the stage for a music festival and
beat several organizers.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion at the National
Salvadoran Workers Union, in the northeastern part of the capital.
   Union leader Humberto Centeno said the woman, who lives nearby,
suffered minor injuries, he said.
   Centeno blamed the attack on supporters of President Jose
Napoleon Duarte. He said he believed Duarte's U.S.-backed centrist
government was trying to intimidate the union on the eve of a march
by 50,000 workers planned for Sunday, the country's labor day.
   In San Miguel, soldiers destroyed the stage the music festival,
surrounded a hotel where foreign artists were staying and beat
several organizers of the event and workers building the stage,
University of El Salvador rector Luis Argueta Antillon said
Saturday.
   He called the action ``an act of terrorism.''
   The festival, called ``A Song for Peace with Sovereignty and
Independence in El Salvador,'' began Wednesday in the San Miguel
square. On Saturday, the last day of the festival, the performances
took place in San Salvador as planned, in a plaza across from the
Metropolitan Cathedral.
   Among the artists were American singer and composer Holly Near;
the U.S. group ``Human Condition,'' a Venezuelan group and several
Salvadoran groups.
   San Miguel is about 85 miles east of San Salvador.
   The armed forces blamed guerrillas for the deaths of four women
and two men whose bodies were found Friday night on a ranch near
Santa Ana, 40 miles from San Salvador.
   A military source in the area said the peasants were taken from
their homes Thursday by men in olive green uniforms and fatally
shot.
   A red cloth with FPL-FMLN, initials of the Popular Liberation
Forces of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, was found
on one of the victims, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The front is the umbrella organization for five leftist
guerrilla groups fighting to overthrow the government.
   In April, 72 rebels were killed and 47 wounded in combat, the
armed forces said Saturday. It said 41 soldiers were killed and 76
wounded.
   The report blamed the rebels for the deaths of 41 campesinos. It
said the rebels wounded 11 others and kidnapped 41 civilians during
the month.
   Nearly 65,000 people have died in the 8-year-old war, the
majority of them civilians, according to human rights organizations.

<TEXT>
   Government and rebel leaders on
Saturday ended their second round of discussions with both sides
far apart on an agreement for a lasting cease-fire.
   The Sandinistas and rebels, known as Contras, gave conflicting
accounts of progress.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, head of the Sandinista
delegation, said after the meeting ended at 7 p.m. EDT that ``some
progress'' had been made. He said the two sides agreed on 16 of 32
proposals made by the government.
   Ortega gave no details. The Sandinistas said the negotiators had
tentatively agreed to meet again May 12-14, but the place has not
been determined.
   Contra spokesman Aristides Sanchez told a news conference there
had been no agreement on when the next session will be held and he
said the rebels did not want the talks to resume in Managua
``because the climate is not good here.''
   He said the rebels refused to sign a joint communique the
Sandinistas had prepared on what was achieved during the last
session.
   Meanwhile, police arrested three more people outside a union
hall were 38 workers were in the sixth day of a hunger strike
demanding higher wages.
   The government and rebel leaders met behind closed doors at a
Managua hotel in the third and final day of talks to work out
details of the March 23 cease-fire pact.
   The rebel delegation got rid of one of the major stumbling
blocks when it agreed to withdraw its demand that combatants be
allowed to replace damaged weapons and spent ammunition while they
are in special zones.
   A Sandinista proposal calls for the rebels to move into seven
zones. Once they are concentrated in the areas, the government is
to release about 700 political prisoners and allow rebel delegates
to take part in national talks with political parties.
   The Contras on Friday rejected a Sandinista proposal that the
International Red Cross, seen here as sympathizing with the
government, immediately resupply the rebels. The cease-fire pact
called for delivery of food, clothes and medicine to the Contra
combatants only after they entered the zones.
   Contras say they want to select the organization that will send
the goods. The rebels agreed in the pact to accept only non-lethal
supplies from a neutral organization.
   Sandinista police, meanwhile, cordoned off the entrance to the
General Workers Federation, an umbrella group of anti-government
unions and the scene of demonstrations on Friday.
   About 1,500 construction workers and car mechanics walked off
their jobs Feb. 25 to demand higher salaries and protest economic
measures enacted a week earlier.
   Union officials and witnesses said the Interior Ministry's
Special Forces, known as ``black berets,'' used rubber truncheons
to break up demonstrations outside the union headquarters. Inside,
38 workers were staging the hunger strike.
   Witnesses said two men and a woman were taken into police
custody Saturday morning for gathering outside the building.
   Police scuffled with the two men and then roughly tossed them
into a pickup truck, the witnesses said.
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinista National
Liberation Front, reported Saturday that police detained 25 people
during the demonstrations. Eleven others were taken into custody
earlier in the week.
   The newspaper also reported an altercation between Interior
Minister Tomas Borge and Jose Castillo Osejo, director of
anti-Sandinista Radio Corporation.
   Castillo told The Associated Press he was summoned to Borge's
office Friday for allegedly reporting erroneous information about
the strike. The minister punched him in the mouth, Castillo said.
   Barricada reported that Castillo insulted Borge when the two met
in private.
   ``As a result of the incident, Castillo suffered minor
injuries,'' it said.

   Cold air moving into the Northwest triggered showers Saturday
while a storm system developed over the central Rockies, and
thunderstorms were scattered over the South.
   Showers were scattered along the coast of Oregon and northern
California and over central Montana and northwestern Utah.
   Snow showers spread over the Oregon Cascades, with near-zero
visibility reported at Sexton Summit. An advisory for 6 or more
inches of snow was posted and snow also developed in sections of
the Sierra Nevada range in northern California.
   The developing storm system produced gusty wind over southern
California's mountains and desert areas with gusts to 50 mph
reported over the mountains and gusts to 45 mph were clocked in the
desert. Wind speeds were increasing across the mountains and
northern parts of Arizona.
   Snow advisories were posted into early Sunday for the mountains
and foothills of Montana and for far western Wyoming. A winter
storm watch was posted into Sunday for Wyoming's Big Horn and Wind
River mountains.
   In the South, showers and thunderstorms were scattered from the
central Gulf Coast region through much of Florida. Strong
thunderstorm wind caused about $100,000 damage to 15 to 20 trailer
homes in Venice, Fla., police Lt. Jim Hanks said.
   In Boca Raton, Fla., wind threw a car 50 feet, damaged several
homes, snapped power lines and blew windows out of stores and cars,
authorities said.
   Elsewhere, showers were scattered across New England with
thunderstorms from northern New Jersey into southeastern New York
state.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Truckee, Calif., to 90 at Laredo, Texas, and Chandler,
Ariz. The low for the day was 18 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Sunday, showers were forecast from the Northwest into the
high Plains, with thunderstorms scattered into North Dakota. Snow,
possibly heavy at times, was forecast at higher elevations of the
northern Rockies from Montana into Wyoming, and over the northern
mountains of Arizona. Thunderstorms were forecast over much of the
Florida Peninsula, with scattered rain across New England.
   Highs only in the middle to upper 40s were predicted in parts of
the inland Northwest; in the 50s across the Pacific Northwest
through a small area of southern Nevada, central Arizona and
eastern Utah into eastern Montana, and from the eastern Great Lakes
through New England; in the 80s from southern New Mexico through
the southern Plains and eastern Texas; in the low to mid 90s across
west-central Texas into the central Rio Grande Valley; and in the
60s or 70s across much of the rest of the nation.

   Three sailors who were killed when an
explosion and fire filled the submarine USS Bonefish with dense
smoke and toxic gas were remembered Saturday as men who knew the
cost of freedom.
   About 500 people gathered for a memorial service for the three
who died in the accident in the conventionally powered boat off the
Florida coast six days earlier.
   ``We loved these three valiant men,'' said Capt. James
Rutherford of Submarine Group Six, to which the Bonefish belonged.
``Thank you God for men like them who know the price of liberty.''
   The accident killed Lt. Ray Everts, 30, of Naoma, W.Va.; Petty
Officer 1st Class Robert W. Bordelon Jr., 39; of Willis, Texas; and
Petty Officer 3rd Class Marshall T. Lindgren, 21, of Pisgah Forest,
N.C.
   A funeral for Bordelon was held Saturday in Conroe, Texas, and
services for the other two victims will be held Sunday. Lindgren's
mother and brother attended the memorial at St. Michaels Lutheran
Church on the edge of Charleston's historic district, said Lt.
Cmdr. John Tull, a spokesman for the Charleston Naval Base.
   Twenty-two other members of the 92-man crew of the
diesel-electric submarine were injured, most by smoke inhalation.
The Bonefish was towed back to the Charleston Naval Base on Friday.
   While most of the Navy personnel in the congregation wore their
summer white uniforms, the Bonefish crew dressed in their somber
winter blues.
   ``It is all the men of the Bonefish we honor today,'' said Vice
Adm. Daniel Cooper, commander of the Atlantic Fleet submarine
forces.
   ``The miracle is that 89 men were rescued and the ship returned
to port through the heroic, professional and unselfish acts of
others,'' he added.
   Rear Adm. William Owens, commander of Submarine Group Six,
praised the crew of the Bonefish, saying ``the spirit and the
substance of these people is something that I will always
remember.''
   Navy Chaplain Lt. Cmdr. Raymond Michener said the Navy family
has suffered a loss.
   ``All of us gathered here are in a very real sense one large
family. We are brought together by nothing else than the sea,'' he
said.
   The Bonefish was on a training exercise when it was struck by
the explosion and fire in a battery compartment. It was submerged
at periscope depth at the time, and the crew quickly surfaced the
vessel and evacuated to other Navy ships.
   There's no timetable for completion of the investigation of the
mishap, Tull said.

<TEXT>
   OPEC oil ministers failed early Sunday to
agree on a production cut that analysts said could boost prices,
officials said.
   The oil ministers said they would resume their debate Sunday
night.
   Eight of OPEC's 13 member nations backed a proposed two-month
cut of 300,000 barrels a day in the cartel's production that
analysts said could raise gasoline prices by 2.5 cents a gallon.
   But Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister, said Saudi
Arabia and three other Persian Gulf Arab states rejected the plan.
The Saudis proposed that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries cut only about 200,000 barrels a day, he said.
   The Saudi idea was rejected by the eight-country majority, and
the talks adjourned in the early hours Sunday. The ministers have
been meeting since Thursday.
   ``We're still studying the issue,'' said Hisham Nazer, the Saudi
oil minister, as he left the 3{-hour meeting. He declined to say
more.
   The other three holdouts are Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates, whose oil ministers also have said they needed more time
to consult with their governments. The 13th member not voting on
the proposal is Iraq, which normally does not follow OPEC's
production quotas.
   The Venezuelan oil minister, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, said the
cartel leaders were still stuck ``on the same questions.''
   ``We are giving time to the four (gulf Arab) countries to think
again about the proposal,'' Hernandez said.
   Several officials, including Iran's Aghazadeh, said the Saudis
insisted any cuts in production be shared equally rather than
following the usual practice of assigning cuts in accordance with
each member's share of current OPEC production.
   In other words the Saudis insisted that Gabon, which pumps only
150,000 barrels a day, cut as much as Saudi Arabia, which produces
4.3 million barrels daily.
   Analysts and OPEC officials said the proposal to cut OPEC
production by 300,000 barrels, or 2 percent, could boost oil prices
by as much as $1 a barrel, meaning an increase of 2.5 cents per
gallon at the gasoline pump.
   OPEC oil currently is selling for $14 to $16 per 42-gallon
barrel, well below its target of $18 a barrel.
   The Saudis' proposal to cut output by 200,000 barrels a day
would match the reduction that a group of six non-OPEC producers
has offered to make in tandem with the cartel, according to
delegation sources.
   They reported the Saudis said they would be willing to accept
the 300,000 figure if the non-OPEC group raised its cutback offer
to that level.
   The six non-OPEC nations include Mexico, Egypt, China, Oman,
Angola and Malaysia.
   Taken together, the cuts would represent a loss of only about 1
percent of oil supplies in the non-communist world.
   Normally, a cutback that small would have little or no effect on
prices. But analysts said the psychology of the market is such that
any agreement on production restraint between OPEC and the non-OPEC
group would give at least a modest boost to prices.
   Paul McDonald, a London-based oil consultant, said prices could
rise as much as $1 a barrel in the very short term.
   ``It's sheer genius, as far as getting them over the next two
months'' when oil markets were expected to be weak, McDonald said
in a telephone interview.
   By June, oil demand in the industrialized countries is expected
to pick up a little, putting less pressure on OPEC to restrain its
production, he said.
   If the Vienna talks ended without agreement, however, prices
would be expected to fall sharply, analysts said.
   The proposed mutual cuts in oil output were easy for most OPEC
members to accept, partly because they are so small and of such
short duration that it would be virtually impossible to verify
whether any of the cuts were actually made.
   ``The whole thing is a nonsense'' in terms of actually changing
the balance of supply and demand, McDonald said.
   OPEC leaders insisted, however, that the proposed cuts would be
important.
   ``If one cuts by (a combined) 500,000 barrels a day the market
would stabilize,'' Etienne Tchioba, the oil minister of Gabon, said
in an interview.
   Other cartel officials acknowledged that the proposed cuts were
more imagined than real.
   ``It's only psychological,'' said one senior OPEC official,
speaking on condition he not be further identified.
   The main aim of the proposal was to establish a precedent for
mutual production cuts with the non-OPEC nations.
   If this could be repeated later, or widened to include more
independent producers, OPEC could have an easier time stabilizing
oil prices around its target of $18 a barrel.

   The Reagan administration has toughened its drug
enforcement by allowing the Coast Guard to seize any boat or ship
on which even a small amount of contraband is found, Transportation
Secretary Jim Burnley said Saturday.
   Since the policy was enacted April 11, the Coast Guard has
confiscated nine vessels _ including a $300,000 yacht off the coast
of Florida _ that would not previously have been seized, officials
said.
   A confiscated boat must be returned to its owners only only if
allegations of illegal drugs on board are proved to be false.
Otherwise, the boat is turned over to U.S. Customs, which can sell
it at an auction.
   ``This new policy should be taken as fair warning to anyone who
is using or transporting any detectable amount of drugs on our
waterways, whether it's in a commercial vessel, a row boat or a
million-dollar yacht,'' Burnley said at a news conference.
   ``They will not only be prosecuted to the fullest extent of
applicable state and federal laws, but will be risking the loss of
their property as well.''
   Burnley said the administration now has ``zero tolerance''
toward illegal drug use. The new policy is an extension of the
previous strategy of focusing on larger quantities of drugs where
there was an intent to deal, Burnley said.
   The tougher policy is an attempt to reduce demand for illegal
drugs, Burnley said. He said it is ``based on the notion that when
we permit even the smallest drug infraction _ what some still call
recreational drug use _ we open the door a bit wider for drug
smugglers around the world and for drug users in this country.''
   In Florida, ship owners found in possession of small amounts of
drugs often haven't been prosecuted because the U.S. attorney's
office was flooded with bigger drug cases, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim
Simpson, spokesman for the Coast Guard district based in Miami.
   ``Now we will at least be able to take the boats away,'' Simpson
said. ``It should be a deterrent.''
   On another front in the government's drug crackdown, customs
agents at Oroville, Wash., on the Canadian border, reported seizing
an 18-wheel truck loaded with aluminum Friday after a ``roach
clip'' and cigarette papers were found in the truck's cab.
   The truck, worth about $60,000 and owned by a North Dakota
company, was the second tractor-trailer confiscated by customs
agents in Washington state this month.

<HEAD>Met Tenor Who Starred In `Otello' Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Metropolitan Opera tenor James McCracken,
celebrated internationally for his singing of the title role in
Verdi's ``Otello,'' has died at age 61 of complications from a
stroke.
   McCracken died Friday night at Roosevelt Hospital, where he had
been admitted two weeks earlier. A respiratory ailment already had
forced him to cancel his performances this month.
   The tenor appeared at Carnegie Hall in December in a concert
performance of ``La Fiamma'' and performed as Florestan in
``Fidelio'' in December and January with the Washington Opera.
   McCracken leapt into operatic prominence in 1960 when he sang
``Otello'' to great acclaim in Washington, D.C.; Zurich,
Switzerland; and Vienna, Austria.
   McCracken's San Francisco Opera debut in 1962 as ``Otello'' was
declared a sensation. His dark-timbered, fervent tenor and
emotional intensity was well suited to the long and difficult role.
It is believed that McCracken sang ``Otello'' more often than any
tenor in history.
   He was born Dec. 16, 1926, in Gary, Ind. While in a Navy choir,
McCracken was heard by a music-loving officer who suggested he try
for an opera career. With the help of the GI Bill, he sang his way
through two years of music study at Columbia University.
   His opera debut was as Rodolfo in ``La Boheme'' at the Central
City, Colo., Opera in 1952. His Met debut was in a small role in
``La Boheme'' in 1953.
   He and his wife, mezzo-soprano Sandra Warfield, who was singing
principal roles at the Met, left for Europe in 1957 so that
McCracken could further his career. They wrote a book about their
experiences, ``A Star in the Family.''
   McCracken returned to the Metropolitan Opera in triumph in 1963,
becoming the first American native to sing ``Otello'' at the Met.
In the 1970s he sang at the Met in ``Aida,'' ``Carmen,'' ``Otello''
twice, ``Le Prophete'' and ``Tannhauser.''
   The tenor broke with the Met in 1978 because he wasn't scheduled
for televised performances. He returned and sang at the Met's
centennial celebration in 1983. He sang with Leontyne Price in her
four farewell performances as ``Aida.'' The last one, in January
1985, was televised.
   Metropolitan Opera music director James Levine once said of
McCracken, ``You can count on the fingers of one hand the singers
in the world at any time who can sing the roles he sings.''
   Director John Dexter, while working at the Met, said, ``Only two
men in the world can command the stage as he does, (Laurence)
Olivier and (Paul) Scofield.''
   Survivors besides his wife include a son, John McCracken, of
Freeport, N.Y.; a daughter, Ahna McCracken-Bogy, of New York; and a
sister, Jeanyellen Straight, of Huntington, Ind.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, waving a
machete that he called a symbol of the valor of the Panamanian
people, vowed Saturday to keep fighting U.S. efforts to oust him as
Panama's strongman.
   ``This machete says, `Not one step back!''' Noriega told a
``solidarity meeting'' of about 300 Latin American labor leaders.
   Noriega brandished the machete several times and people in the
crowd cheered and waved machetes they had been given by the
government as they entered the conference hall for the closing
ceremony. The meeting was organized by pro-government groups.
   ``This is the machete of Panamanian dignity, of Panamanian
valor,'' Noriega shouted and the audience chanted, ``Not one step
back!''
   ``There can be no national or international dialogue, unless the
popular forces negotate their own security. This commander is
willing to accept a dialogue for the benefit of the popular
forces,'' Noriega said.
   He claimed the United States is using Panama ``as an
experimental field'' to develop methods to subjugate other Latin
American governments.
   The steel machetes, engraved with the Panamanian seal, are sold
as souvenirs and are very popular.
   Before entering the hall, the general told reporters he has ``no
commitments with the United States'' to quit as chief of the
Defense Forces.
   Washington officials said Friday that Noriega had agreed during
recent negotiations with U.S. envoy Michael Kozak to step down as
the military commander but rejected American insistence that he
leave the country immediately after resigning.
   ``Yes, I had talks with Kozak but I have no committments of any
kind, no commitments with the United States,'' Noriega told the
reporters. ``If they (the United States) want to be irresponsible,
I will not.'' He did not elaborate.
   Noriega's opponents said they were dismayed by the reports that
the United States had agreed to a plan that would allow Noreiga to
stay in Panama if he resigned as head of the 15,000-member Defense
Forces, the key to his political power.
   ``It would be a serious mistake if Noriega is allowed to stay in
Panama,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon, president of the Christian
Democrat Party. ``He will continue to be a focus of controversy.''
   Panamanian officials had earlier acknowledged that Noriega met
with Kozak, an aide to Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams,
but denied that any deal was made.
   The United States has been trying since February to oust the
general, who is under indictment in Florida on drug-trafficking
charges. But he has clung to power despite U.S. economic sanctions
that have paralyzed the Panamanian economy.
   The Reagan administration announced Saturday that it was
relaxing some restrictions and would allow Americans to pay utility
bills and sales and excise taxes to the government. Payments on
corporate and personal income taxes, import duties, port fees and
corporate social security payments still are prohibited.
   ``Noriega will go out on his terms, when he is ready,'' said a
Christian Democrat Party leader who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The Americans are negotiating now from a position of weakness,
but they cannot back down after publicly demanding that Noriega
step down and leave the country.''
   The Christian Democrat and Authentic Panamanian parties are the
largest opposition political parties in Panama.
   The Authentic Panamanian Party called for a massive rally next
Friday, the anniversary of the 1984 elections it feels were stolen
from party leader Arnulfo Arias Madrid with the approval of the
United States, which then backed Noriega's candidate, Nicolas
Ardito Barletta.
   Ardito Barletta later was deposed by Noriega. Vice President
Eric Arturo Delvalle replaced him, then was ousted by Noriega on
Feb. 26 after Delvalle tried to fire the general.
   The U.S. government recognizes Delvalle as the legitimate
president, but some of the opposiion forces do not.
   ``There will be no peace or progress in Panama until the
government the people elected (in 1984) is reestablished ... and
the police clique that oppresses the country leaves the barracks
and yields to the young officers who understand that civil power
belongs only to the people,'' the Authentic Panamanian Party
communique said.

<HEAD>Women Workers of World War II Meet With Queen Mother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of women who served in the
``Land Army'' that kept British agriculture going during World War
II gathered Saturday with Queen Mother Elizabeth to share memories.
   ``All of us are a little older _ and perhaps a little wiser _
than in those wartime days,'' the 87-year-old former queen told the
gathering of 560 women at the Grand Hotel.
   ``But I know the same spirit of good comradeship, loyalty and
devotion to queen and country remains just the same,'' said the
queen mother, whose daughter is Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``The King and I were proud and grateful to you all for your
great contribution to the war effort,'' she said, referring to her
late husband, King George VI.
   The women thronged around her, cheering and waving until a path
was cleared for her by officers of Scotland Yard's Special Branch
who guard the royal family and government.
   At its height, more than 90,000 women belonged to the ``Land
Army,'' taking over the farm and forestry jobs left empty when the
men went to fight.
   Land Army chairman Jean Proctor, told the queen mother: ``At the
time of our service you were our queen and none of us can forget
your concern for our welfare.''
   It was a final national reunion of the British Women's Land Army
Society, but local reunions will continue.

<HEAD>Legalization Lines Lengthen As Amnesty Deadline Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Lines of undocumented aliens with hopes for better futures
formed outside legalization centers throughout the country, and
immigration officials braced for an even bigger onslaught as next
week's amnesty deadline neared.
   ``Monday, Tuesday, it's going to be outrageous,'' said Richard
S. Rios, director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service
center in Houston. An estimated 3,000 people submitted applications
at the center Saturday and another 3,500 were expected Sunday, he
said.
   ``The crowd will grow as the deadline approaches,'' Rios said.
   The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act gives aliens who can
prove continuous residency in the United States since Jan. 1, 1982
until midnight Wednesday to apply for legal status.
   From California to New York, INS offices were staying open
Saturday and Sunday, and many planned extended hours next week.
   Officials also were waiving interviews with applicants until
after the deadline to cope with the rush.
   In the New York borough of Queens, immigration officials staged
a party to entice applicants Saturday. Balloons and American flags
decorated a big room, a calypso singer entertained the crowds, and
a disc jockey and a steel band were waiting in the wings. Officials
also served refreshments.
   One Trinidad native, who said he has lived in New York for 18
years, said he waited until the last minute to apply because he had
trouble raising the $185 application fee. The fee for children is
$50, and there is a family ceiling of $420.
   Yvette La Gonterie, chief INS legalization officer for Brooklyn
and Queens, said she expected 1,000 people at the office Saturday
and again Sunday. Over 100,000 of the estimated 250,000 illegal
immigrants in the New York City area are expected to apply by the
deadline, she added.
   The refusal by Congress last week to extend the application
deadline to Nov. 30 was spurring the flow of applicants, some
officials said.
   ``They've had a year and they've just procrastinated,'' said Jim
Pomeroy, INS district manager for New Jersey.
   The Paterson, N.J., office had more than 100 applicants by 10
a.m. Saturday, Pomeroy said. About 22,000 people statewide, mostly
from Latin America, have applied for citizenship, he added.
   Moiseca Castillo, 37, of Peru, stood at the Paterson office
Saturday with his cousin, Victor Arevado, who is a citizen.
   ``Like many Latin Americans, we came here looking for better
opportunities,'' said Castillo, who said he has lived for eight
years with his cousin in Elizabeth.
   Three men lined up outside an INS center in Arlington, Texas,
Saturday said they were eager to gain amnesty.
   ``It's a little safer, and a little relieving,'' said Pete R.
Gonzales, an INS security officer who translated for the three
Mexican immigrants. ``They won't worry about people ... telling
them, `We will call immigration.'''
   The small office in Wenatchee, Wash., 150 miles east of Seattle,
stopped accepting new applications Friday after being inundated
with agricultural workers apparently confused about Wednesday's
deadline, acting director Allan Callison said.
   Under a special program, agricultural workers have until Nov. 30
to apply for citizenship if they can prove they worked for at least
90 days from May 1985 to May 1986, he said. Some farm employers
apparently have started demanding work authorization cards, he
added.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Immigration Officials To Stop Harassing Salvadorans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered the Immigration
and Naturalization Service not to use coercion to keep Salvadoran
refugees from applying for political asylum.
   In a ruling released late Friday, U.S. District Judge David V.
Kenyon granted a petition for a permanent injunction ordering the
INS to routinely inform all Salvadorans detained that they have a
right to ask for political asylum, legal counsel and even access to
pay telephones.
   The ruling reaffirmed a preliminary injunction Kenyon issued in
1982 in which he ruled that the INS routinely threatened
Salvadorans to talk them out of their rights. INS attorneys had
denied many of the allegations of abuses.
   Civil rights attorneys hailed the ruling.
   ``The decision really affirms the fact that Salvadorans with
valid claims were simply being denied justice,'' said Linton
Joaquin, executive director of the Central American Refugee Center,
who helped argue the class-action lawsuit.
   The government's lead attorney in the case, Allen Hausman,
criticized the decision, saying it offered sweeping protections to
Salvadorans that are not enjoyed by other immigrants.
   ``How can you say a person from Haiti or South Africa or Iran is
less deserving? It's hard to distinguish,'' said Hausman, assistant
director of the Justice Department's Office of Immigration
Litigation in Washington.
   The attorney said he didn't know if the INS would appeal.
   Kenyon's decision came after a two-year, non-jury trial that
featured testimony from 180 witnesses, including many immigrants
who said they had been tortured in their native country.
   The total number of Salvadorans who have applied for asylum was
not available, but the INS said late last year it was considering
about 25,000 applications from Salvadorans in Los Angeles. More
than half of the estimated 750,000 Salvadorans living in the United
States are in the Los Angeles area.
   During the 1985 fiscal year, 74 Salvadorans were granted
political asylum in the United States and 2,229 had their
application rejected. During the same period, 2,779 Iranians and
408 Nicaraguans were granted asylum.
   The Reagan administration maintains that many of the Salvadorans
do not qualify because they are economic immigrants fleeing poverty
rather than political refugees fleeing persecution.

<HEAD>200-Foot Sinkhole `A Double Freak,' Geologist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEBRING, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sinkhole that became one of Florida's
largest seems to have stablized with one house at the bottom slowly
being covered by water and another home teetered on the edge, a
geologist said Saturday.
   ``I call this a double freak sinkhole because it's so far south
and it's so big,'' said William Wilson, a geologist with the
Florida Sinkhole Research Institute at the University of Central
Florida.
   ``At least one whole acre has been swallowed up in one big
gulp,'' he said.
   ``It appears to be stable,'' Wilson said, following the typical
pattern of sinkholes, which usually stabilize within a day or two
after taking anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to collapse.
   The sinkhole, which collapsed in a subdivision near here Friday
evening, is more than 200 feet wide and 15 to 20 feet deep, he
said. The average sinkhole in southern central Florida is about 20
feet across, Wilson said.
   ``This sinkhole is larger than 99 percent of all other sinkholes
in Florida,'' Wilson said.
   ``It's real gentle,'' said Sebring police Lt. Jerry Fennell.
``It's not a real abrupt hole; it's more like a saucer.''
   The sinkhole is becoming a pond since the water table is about 5
or 6 feet below the ground level in that area.
   The house at the edge of the sinkhole is completely ruined,
Wilson said.
   ``It looks like a drunken sailor,'' he said. ``... But it
doesn't look like it's going to get sucked underground like the
first house.''
   Beyond those houses, neighborhood residents are moving back into
their homes, Fennell said.
   ``It's highly unlikely Highlands County is going to have a rash
of sinkholes,'' Wilson said.
   Sinkholes are generally caused by changes in the level of water
flowing through limestone and clay formations under the soil. A
sudden lowering of the water table caused by irrigation or drought,
for instance, can weaken walls and roofs of the underground
limestone caverns, leading to their breakdown.
   Too much water drainage into the ground also creates pressure
that can dissolve claylike materials and rock formations
underground.

<TEXT>
   The once-in-four-years general conference of
the United Methodist Church ended the first lap Saturday of a
concentrated exercise in ecclesiastical democracy.
   Like most U.S. Protestant bodies, the church's organizational
system is modeled on the nation's representative system, and the
process here provided an intensified example of it.
   So far, it has been preoccupied with preliminary hearings of
legislative committees on a range of proposals, including the
status of homosexuals in the United Methodist Church and a new
hymnbook. Decisions will come next week in the second stage of the
11-day conference, which runs through Friday.
   The group is the top lawmaking body for the approximately 10
million United Methodists in the country, who make up the nation's
second-largest Protestant denomination after the Southern Baptists.
   They elect, from their regional units, the 996 national
delegates, half laity and half clergy. In a sense, they resemble
legislators sent by states to Congress.
   Somewhat like the Congressional Record, a daily, similar-looking
publication, the Daily Christian Advocate, provides a verbatim
account of general proceedings and a summary of committee
deliberations.
   There is lobbying here, too, including advocates in the
Cervantes Convention Center hallways who passed out buttons and
brochures promoting church establishment of a university in Africa.
   That project, costing an estimated $20 million and to be located
in Zimbabwe, was approved by the conference Saturday.
   As in the secular political realm, the conference's task
involves carving out budgets, and a 14 percent increase is being
proposed to $100 million annually for national operations. That
doesn't include the approximately $2.5 billion given annually for
local and regional activities.
   Alongside the general conference, or legislative branch, the
church's approximately 100 area bishops serve as the executive
branch, appointing clergy to pastoral or other duties.
   The church also has 13 national boards or agencies, somewhat
like cabinet-level departments.
   Bishops have no vote at the legislative conference, but are
required to be present, address it, and in rotation, preside over
it.
   In addition to the legislative and executive branches, a
nine-member judicial council elected by the conference serves as
the church's ``supreme court'' to settle disputes over church law
or constitution. The council has a rigorous schedule during the
general conference.
   The cost of the gathering: about $2.5 million, including the
convention hall rental fee, the delegates' air travel and $55 each
per day for living expenses.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For Death Penalty For `Drug Kingpins'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 4 grafs after 2nd graf pvs, bgng, `Bush, denying,'

in Central American effort.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush criticized Hollywood
films that glamorize drugs and challenged the Democrats Saturday to
join his call for the death penalty for drug kingpins.
   Bush, denying that investigations of Attorney General Edwin
Meese III are hurting his campaign, also warned that if the
Democrats ``want to go down the low road, we'll meet them.''
   In another development, The Washington Post reported in its
Sunday editions that testimony and documents from a private lawsuit
portray top aides to Bush as being more actively involved in
Central American counterinsurgency planning from 1983 to 1986 than
previously disclosed.
   The information, however, does not contradict assertions by
senior advisers Donald P. Gregg and Col. Samuel J. Watson III that
they were unaware until August 1986 of the plan to resupply the
Nicaraguan rebels during a ban on U.S. aid, the newspaper said.
   According to the information, Bush was advised on June 3, 1986
of the Salvadoran Air Force's need for spare parts for its
helicopters. The memo stressed the need to quickly solve the
problem to help Salvordan President Jose Napolean Duarte win the
war. Bush wrote ``Good!'' on the memo.
   Gregg and Watson provided the memos and testimony last week
during pretrial questioning of witnesses in a $24 million civil
suit filed by two journalists against 29 people, many of whom
figure in the Iran-Contra investigation.
   Bush, at a rally in the sunny atrium of a Cleveland State
University building, called for all Americans to ``stand up against
drug use, even casual use, (and) express our outrage when we see
some in the entertainment industry condoning, almost advocating
cocaine as some kind of a modern hip lifestyle.''
   In an interview with Cleveland reporters, Bush said he was
shocked at the approving way cocaine was presented in a video he
and his wife, Barbara, rented. He did not name the film.
   He told the crowd of 300, ``There's much more to do in this
fight.''
   ``We've appointed tougher judges. We are getting more conviction
and longer sentences. But where are the Democrats on mandatory
sentencing, on tougher penalties for those who poison our kids with
drugs? I favor the death penalty for drug kingpins, those involved
in drug-related killings,'' he said.
   ``If Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson are serious about this,
let's see where they stand on throwing the book at those who are
poisoning the lives of the young people.''
   Both Dukakis and Jackson oppose capital punishment for any crime.
   Bush said, ``What about those ... who get minors to do their
dirty work, their drug-dealing for them? Throw the book at them.
Put 'em where the sun don't shine.''
   Dr. Otis Bowen, the secretary of health and human services,
voiced pessimism this week about the war on drugs and told Reagan
at a White House meeting that the Democrats ``are poised to steal
from our party what has been a traditionally Republican issue: law
enforcement.''
   Aboard Air Force Two, Robert Teeter, Bush's polling expert and
strategist, said drugs have become an increasingly important issue
in voters' minds in the past six months.
   Voters ``want answers, they want results. They ... don't want to
blame somebody, they want a solution,'' said Teeter.
   Bush also visited a nursing home in Columbus, St. Raphael's Home
for the Aged, on what was once the estate of his industrialist
grandfather, the late Samuel Bush.
   There Bush told the Carmelite nuns and elderly residents, ``I
pledge to you that in a Bush administration, there will be
long-term care legislation put on the books.''
   Bush also took in a spring football scrimmage at Ohio State.
Before returning to Washington, the vice president rode a river
boat across the Ohio River from West Virginia to Marietta, Ohio, to
mark the bicentennial of that one-time frontier town.
   Some unemployed steel workers from Waterford, Ohio, carried
protest signs and groaned when Bush spoke about the 64-month
economic recovery. But most of the crowd of 5,000 at the water's
edge cheered the Republican candidate.
   ``Look, some people in your state are hurting, and so are they
in mine,'' Bush said. ``But we have created 15{ million new jobs
since 1982. ... That is progress and we must keep it going until
everybody benefits.''
   The vice president told Cleveland reporters he has evidence to
throw the ``sleaze'' allegations back in the Democrats' faces, but
declined to be specific.
   He said he is ``keeping my powder dry. ... I want to see the

<HEAD>Report: Treatment for Psoriasis Likely to Produce Birth Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug for psoriasis is closely related to
the acne drug Accutane, and is probably even more likely to produce
birth defects when taken by pregnant women, according to a
published report.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that at least
seven babies have been born with defects to women who had taken the
drug Tegison, though no cases have been been recorded in the United
States.
   The drug was licensed in the United States in December 1986, and
is used to treat severe cases of psoriasis, whose symptoms include
scaly, reddish patches of skin.
   The newspaper said experts have called for restrictions on the
distribution of Tegison like those suggested for Accutane last week
by the Food and Drug Administration.
   Tegison, whose generic name is etretinate, can remain dormant in
bodily tissues at least two years after it is taken, and can cause
birth defects long after a woman stops taking it, Dr. Franz Rosa of
the Food and Drug Administration told the Times.
   Tegison is produced in the United States by Roche Laboratories
of Nutley, N.J., a subsidiary of F. Hoffman-La Rouche Ltd. of
Switzerland. Roche also makes Accutane.
   ``I think etretinate will be a much bigger problem than
Accutane,'' said Dr. Devendra Kochhar of the Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia. ``The number of women exposed will be
less, but etretinate is manyfold more toxic than Accutane.''
   Tegison carries a pregnancy warning saying that it has not yet
been determined how long a woman must avoid pregnancy after taking
the drug.
   A spokeswoman for Hoffman-La Roche, Carolyn Glynn, told the
Times that the company was investigating 10 new related compounds
for skin treatments. ``So far, pregnancy risk does seem to come
with this class of drugs,'' she said.
   She said the company was considering whether to make the
pregnancy warning more prominent on the package.
   ``Everything we do for Accutane is certainly applicable to
Tegison,'' she said. Last week the FDA endorsed suggestions by the
company that it strengthen its warning on Accutane and make it
harder for women to obtain.
   Tegison and Accutane can cause facial deformities, mental
retardation and often lethal heart defects in babies born to users
of the drug, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Convicted Murderer An Apparent Suicide After Escape Plans Foiled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POLK CITY, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of contracting his wife's
murder through an advertisement in Soldier of Fortune magazine was
found hanging in his prison cell Saturday, an apparent suicide,
authorities said.
   Robert Spearman, who was serving a sentence of life plus 20
years in the 1985 slaying of his wife, was found dead three days
after authorities announced they had thwarted a planned helicopter
escape.
   The body of Spearman, 60, was found hanging by a bedsheet from
the top bars of his cell wall in Polk County Correctional Center in
this town about 35 miles northeast of Tampa, said state corrections
spokesman Bob Macmaster. Spearman was found Saturday morning just
15 minutes after the last check of his cell, Macmaster said.
   Macmaster said Spearman was not considered a suicide risk.
   Spearman had been transferred to the Polk prison Monday from
Zephyrhills Correctional Institution, 25 miles to the east.
   On Wednesday, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement
disclosed that agents had thwarted an attempt by Spearman, a
millionaire boatyard owner from Palm Beach Gardens, to arrange a
helicopter escape from Zephryrhills.
   Two undercover FDLE agents posing as pilots received $4,700 as a
down payment on a $54,700 contract to steal a helicopter and fly
Spearman out of the prison, said Ed Williams, agent in charge of
the FDLE's Tampa office.
   Spearman asked the undercover agents to have two machine guns
and four hand grenades aboard the helicopter, authorities said. He
intended to use the grenades to kill his prosecutor, Palm Beach
County Assistant State Attorney Moria Lasch, said John Joyce, an
FDLE spokesman in Tallahassee.
   Spearman was charged with attempted escape and weapons offenses.
Stepson Fred Douglas Laurent Jr. of Fort Lauderdale, a suspected
accomplice, was charged with the same offenses but remains at
large, authorities said.
   Longtime friend Gene Fenno said Spearman was struggling to cope
with prison life when he visited him last summer.
   ``He was always talking about getting out, that he couldn't
stand it,'' Fenno said after the escape plan was disclosed.
   Attorney David Roth, who represented Spearman in his murder
trial, said he was not shocked by the escape plan because under the
sentence imposed in April 1987, he would not be eligible for parole
before he reached his mid-80s.
   ``Someone in his position would not have a great deal to lose,''
Roth said.
   Spearman was convicted of hiring two men who had advertised in
Soldier of Fortune to kill his wife, Anita, for $20,000. She was
bludgeoned to death in November 1985.
   Prosecutors said Spearman wanted to get rid of his
cancer-stricken wife, a former West Palm Beach assistant city
manager, because he had fallen in love with his secretary and
didn't want a costly divorce.

   The wildlife casualty toll from a
175,000-gallon oil spill 40 miles northeast of San Francisco
appeared to have peaked Friday, and gusty winds and high tides
helped the cleanup, officials said.
   ``They aren't picking up many more birds at all now, and we
don't expect to get too many more at all,'' said Coast Guard Lt.
Bob Brach.
   Rescuers have recovered about 470 oil-soaked birds and animals
since a Shell Oil Co. refinery spilled crude oil into the Peyton
Slough on April 23, said Chuck Monroe, regional patrol chief for
the state Fish and Game Department. Of those, about 200 have died
or were found dead, he said.
   Only about a dozen oily birds were brought to the International
Bird Rescue Center in Berkeley on Friday, said spokeswoman Beth
Podvin.
   For the second consecutive day, wind and high tides pushed about
1,500 gallons of oil from remote inlets where it had been trapped
into open water and marshland.
   Although the spread could threaten other coastal wildlife
sanctuaries, it helped the cleanup, authorities said.
   ``More and more oil is getting flushed from the marshy areas
into the (Carquinez) Strait, but that's actually working for the
most part to our advantage because it's making it easier to pick
up,'' said Todd Nelson of the Coast Guard.
   Eight skimmer boats removed several oil-sheen patches over a
12-mile section of the strait, Brach said. More winds and high
tides were expected to continue pushing oil into the strait over
the weekend, he added.
   The crude also has begun to thicken, turning into tar and making
cleanup along shorelines easier, Coast Guard officials said. About
126,000 gallons of the thick crude has been recovered so far, they
said.
   The spill occurred after a pipe used to draw off rainwater broke
inside a Shell oil tank, allowing crude to be siphoned out, Shell
said.
   The company acknowledged the practice of keeping outtake valves
open during storms violated federal regulations.
   Larry Kolb, principal engineer fo the state Regional Water
Quality Control Board, has estimated the spill could cost Shell $4
million, including $3 million in penalties.

<DATELINE>DOVER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two ferries sailed for England Friday to
try to break a seamen's strike that threatened delays of up to 18
hours for travelers heading to continental Europe over a long
weekend.
   About 500 pickets gathered in drizzling rain around midnight (7
p.m. EDT) at the dockside at Dover, preparing what union leaders
promised would be a hostile reception for the two P and O shipping
company ferries and their strike-breaking crews.
   Police reinforcements formed lines in Dover as pickets shouted
at truck drivers crossing picket lines to board ferries of the
rival Sealink company.
   P and O refused to give the two ferries' destination or when
they would arrive.
   The confrontation looming between pickets and non-striking
crewmen at Dover in southeast England, the world's busiest ferry
port, put Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's union-curbing
legislation to its toughest test since her re-election last June.
   The P and O company's Pride of Kent and Pride of Bruges, left
Rotterdam, Holland on a 10-hour voyage to England, crewed by about
280 of the 1,100 employees who accepted new working conditions and
opted out of a 3-month-old strike called by the National Union of
Seamen.
   P and O has fired 720 other seamen who rejected the new
contract, and many of them manned picket lines at Dover.
   Crew members of Sealink have refused for four days to cross the
picket lines, forcing Sealink to cut the number of daily round-trip
voyages to Calais, France from 16 to eight and use only
French-crewed vessels.
   With Monday a public holiday, the problems come on one of the
travel industry's busiest weekends of the year.
   Sealink warned motorists of delays of up to six hours, while bus
passengers were told they might wait 18 hours.
   Truckers faced even longer delays, and police cordoned off lanes
of the highway into Dover to accommodate stranded vehicles.
   Mrs. Thatcher's legislation which forbids sympathy strikes has
enabled Sealink to seek court seizure of the union's funds.
   The measure has proved critical in taming militant labor sectors
like the coal miners, railwaymen and newspaper printworkers in
recent years.
   But the sequestration of funds could push the seamen into voting
for an all-out national strike, and Sealink has appeared at pains
to prevent that, stressing that it is not in dispute with its
workers and does not want to harm their union.
   After talks with government mediators Friday, Sealink and union
negotiators announced ``a skeleton agreement'' to save Sealink from
further disruption and asked to adjourn the hearing until Tuesday.
   The negotiators said that under the agreement the seamen would
confine their pickets to Dover and neighboring Folkestone and call
off the scattered strikes that have broken out at other English and
Welsh ports.
   But later, the deal collapsed over the failure to bring P and O
into the peace talks.
   ``The deal with Sealink is off so far as I am concerned. All
Sealink ferries should stay in port,'' said Sam McCluskie, leader
of the 24,400-member National Union of Seamen.
   Some pickets set fire to a P and O flag and cheered as McCluskie
warned the crews in Rotterdam: ``If they stay there as scabs, they
will be marked as scabs forever.''
   The ferries sailed from Rotterdam despite last-minute efforts by
the union to persuade their crews to join the strike.
   Dutch tugboats ignored the union's pleas to refuse to handle the
vessels.
   Crews of the tugs said their action was saving the company from
being sold to foreign owners, that the strike decision was
undemocratic and that had they been allowed to vote in a secret
postal ballot, they would have abided by the outcome.

   Africa's limited resources are
being exhausted by wars with groups supported by enemies of Africa,
President Mengistu Haile Mariam said Friday.
   ``Some external forces inimical to Africa have posed obstacles
compelling African states to divert their resources and effort away
from socio-economic development,'' Mengistu said at a ceremony
marking the 30th anniversary of the U.N. Economic Commission for
Africa, which has headquarters in Addis Ababa.
   Mengistu did not name the outside enemies he held responsible
for Africa's internal struggles, but said they ``are challenging
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of African states. Africa
should in one voice, strongly condemn them and tell them, hands off
our continent.''
   His Soviet-backed Marxist government is fighting rebel groups in
Ethiopia's northernmost provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   Eritrea has Africa's longest civil war, a 27-year secessionist
fight by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. In Tigre, south of
Eritrea, the Tigre People's Liberation Front has been fighting for
14 years.
   Mengistu's government refers to the guerrillas as bandits.

<HEAD>Report: Federal Health Insurance Plan Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal employees' health insurance
program is inefficient, overpriced and offers inadequate coverage
to its 10 million beneficiaries, according to a report presented to
the government Friday.
   The Washington Post said in Saturday's editions that the report
to the Office of Personnel Management found that the health plan
costs $785 million more than it should for the benefits it provides
and will only get worse unless changed.
   ``With our huge number of employees, we should be able to get a
really good deal,'' said OPM Director Constance Horner. ``We don't
have a really good deal.''
   The report on the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program _
which covers federal workers, retirees and their dependents _ was
prepared by the consulting firm of Towers, Perrin, Forster &
Crosby. The 28-year-old benefits program has grown to include 480
health plans.
   The consultants found that those plans compete to attract the
healthy and avoid the sick, rather than competing to offer the best
benefits at the cheapest rates.
   The need to attract the healthiest workers means ``no plan can
offer high levels of coverage in certain critical areas'' such as
mental health, drug abuse or nursing care, the consultants found.

   Panamanian opposition leaders are reacting
angrily to a proposed deal under which military strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega would resign his post but remain in Panama at least
temporarily instead of going into exile.
   U.S. officials confirmed Friday that Noriega agreed during
negotiations with the Reagan administration to step down as
commander of the Defense Forces but that he had rejected U.S.
efforts to persuade him to leave the country immediately after
resigning.
   The Washington Post said Noriega is expected to step down in a
matter of weeks and would prefer to live in the Dominican Republic
if he is forced into exile.
   Panamanian Ambassador Juan B. Sosa, a leader of the anti-Noriega
forces in Washington, reacted sharply to word of the proposed
agreement. He accused the United States of going beyond its
authority in trying to negotiate Panama's political future.

   The gunmen who hijacked a Kuwaiti Airways

   On Thursday, Algerian Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun said the
hijackers had left Algeria without getting what they wanted and
without obtaining any concessions for freeing the 31 remaining
passengers.
   But two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Friday the
hijackers had been promised that five or six of the 17 prisoners
held in Kuwait for bomb attacks on the U.S. and French embassies in
1983 would be released early.

who had been promised safe passage, remain in Algeria, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.

   The Reagan administration is expanding the
U.S. military role in the Persian Gulf, saying it will not ``stand
by and watch innocent people be killed or maimed'' in attacks on
neutral ships.
   Under a policy announced Friday by Defense Secretary Frank C.
Carlucci, U.S. forces will go to the aid of non-communist, neutral
ships that are fired on and ask for help.
   Previously, the umbrella of U.S. protection had covered only
American-flagged vessels and 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers that were
allowed to register last summer as U.S.-flag vessels.
   The new policy, approved by President Reagan at a White House
meeting Friday, is aimed chiefly at Iran, which U.S. officials
blame for nearly all of the attacks on ships outside declared
war-exclusion zones. However, Carlucci said the policy should not
be viewed as ``a tilt in either direction'' in the nearly
eight-year war between Iran and Iraq.

   The shipping community generally welcomed President Reagan's

   ``The best attitude to adopt now is a wait-and-see one,'' said a

   The accidental release of at least
175,000 gallons of a particularly gooey form of crude oil has
turned from a minor inconvenience into a major menace to fragile
bird rookeries and a major sports fishing industry.
   ``This is a sin, a crime against God's creation, and makes a
city boy want to cry,'' said Joseph Hallachi, 43, of Santa Cruz,
who drove 120 miles to voluntarily help state crews remove oil from
a city park shoreline.
   The April 23 spill already has killed 200 birds and small
animals and left 250 others suffering ill effects.
   The spill of San Joaquin crude from Shell Oil Co.'s major
Northern California refinery occurred after a broken storm drain
pipe running through the middle of an oil tank allowed crude to be
siphoned out. The company's practice of keeping valves open during
storms was a violation of federal environmental regulations.

point. Fifteen minutes later she departs, and the House of Commons
begins its business for the day.
   The public gallery is packed for Question Time, and millions
more hear the rhetorical fireworks later on radio and TV. Starting
this fall, they'll be able to see the action, too, following a
Commons decision to let in television cameras.

<TEXT>
   While Americans debate the pros
and cons of a 55-mph speed limit, most West Europeans legally drive
much faster than that, and they've been doing so with a lower
fatality rate than the United States.
   West Germans can go as fast as they want on their highway system
known as the autobahn so long as they obey other traffic rules,
such as the proper use of directional signals when changing lanes.
   Elsewhere in Western Europe, speed limits range from 140
kilometers an hour (86.6 mph) in Italy to 88 kmph (55 mph) in
Ireland, which does not have an extensive superhighway system.
   The latest statistics of the 12-nation European Economic
Community, for 1986, when a uniform 55-mph limit was still in
effect in the United States, indicate a highway fatality rate of
14.4 per 100,000 population in contrast to 19.9 in the United
States that year.
   The 1986 highway death toll for EEC nations, with a total
population of 320 million, was 46,046; in the United States, with a
popultion of 242 million, the motor vehicle fatalities numbered
47,900.
   But the United States has more motor vehicles and highways than
West Europeans. Americans are driving an estimated 176 million
cars, buses and trucks on about 42,500 miles of interstate
highways; the 12 EEC countries have an estimated 122 million such
vehicles and about 17,800 miles of highways similar to U.S.
interstates.
   This past March, however, the U.S. Department of Transportation
said traffic fatalities in the United States for 1987 were the
lowest in history, as measured by 100 million miles of travel. It
put the rate by that measurement at 2.4 deaths compared to 2.5 in
1986, 3.3 in 1980 and 24.08 in 1921, the first year the calculation
was made.
   The department attributed the 1987 decline to the increasing use
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving.
   Seat belts are required in most West European countries, as they
are in 32 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Italy plans to
require seat belts by September, 1989.
   Many European countries also have stiff penalties for drunken
driving.
   Although their highway death tolls have been lower than the
United States, some West European countries are trying to get their
own drivers to slow down.
   In 1986, the EEC proposed a uniform speed limit of 120
kilometers an hour (74.4 mph) for member nations, but the idea has
fallen on deaf ears or has met with outright opposition.
   ``The federal republic (West Germany) would be the last country
to accept any uniform limit,'' said Wolf-Ruediger Nickel, a traffic
expert for the state of Lower Saxony.
   Last year, 693 people died in accidents on West Germany's
5,239-mile autobahn system, where multi-car pileups are routine.
Twenty-three vehicles piled up on Sunday morning, April 10, on an
ice-covered stretch near Schweinfurt in northern Bavaria.
   The fatality toll on all roads in West Germany, a nation of 61
million, was 7,973 in 1987, or 13.07 per 100,000 population.
   While the autobahn system has no overall speed limit, many areas
near bridges, construction sites and major cities are posted, often
with police enforcement.
   West German officials also are looking into ways to slow
autobahn traffic in areas where accidents are frequent.
   Traffic engineers in Cologne and Frankfurt are setting up
elaborate systems that will bounce beams of light off passing
traffic, to measure speed and the number of vehicles on two key
stretches of the autobahn.
   The information will be fed to a computer that will
automatically adjust speed limits to conditions and post them in
bright lights on electronically equipped traffic signs.
   Officials in other nations are becoming speed conscious.
   In Britain, Transport Secretary Paul Channon has announced a
package of measures, including more road signs and speed
restrictions, ``to eliminate our own bad driving on motorways.''
   Lower speeds at major road construction sites will be mandatory
and traffic will be monitored by video equipment, among other
measures.
   The British also plan an experiment on their biggest highway,
one linking London and northern England, to see if 70 mph
speed-limit signs will help keep drivers from going any faster.
   About 250 of Britain's 56.4 million people are killed a year on
British motorways, as the major highways are called, and more than
8,000 are injured.
   In Spain, a record 192 people died in traffic fatalities during
the 11-day Easter vacation period this year. Only 17 percent,
however, were attributed to speeding.
   The newspaper El Pais, commenting on the deaths, said Spain
needed ``a better developed highway network.''
   The Spanish government, however, recently sharply raised the
amounts of fines for speeding.
   On French superhighways, the speed limit is 130 kmph (80.6 mph),
but it is not systematically enforced. In 1987, 479 people died on
major highways in France, which has a population of 55.2 million.
   While speed and the difficulty of enforcement remain issues of
major concern, Western European countries also provide an array of
stiff fines, jail terms and temporary license suspension for
drunken drivers.
   Drunken drivers in Switzerland, for instance, have their
licenses seized by police on the spot. Courts decide later when
they get them back.
   First-time drunken drivers face fines of as much as 1,000
guilders ($535) in the Netherlands.
   Swedish police frequently stopped post-midnight traffic on
weekends and administer blood tests on the spot to measure alcohol
in a driver's system.
   The French National Assembly in July passed a law doubling jail
terms for drunken driving to a range of two months to two years.
   Some West Germany cities offer shuttle bus service to keep young
people from driving after a night at discotheques.
   The West German magazine Stern recently published a cover story
on the highway accident toll involving young people who had been
partying all night.
   ``Almost every second car was driving too fast, and alcohol
played a role in every third case,'' Stern said. ``The
recommendation of the accident researchers: `Let the girls do the
driving. At this age (18 to 24), girls are the better drivers.'''

   When Chester Wells closed his failing
robotics firm in Chicago, he never imagined that six months later
he would be making plows and harnesses in the African bush as a
U.S. Peace Corps volunteer.
   ``For a man my age, opportunities were limited and I was
disillusioned,'' said the 66-year-old electrical engineer. ``But I
was not ready to retire. I had too much to offer.''
   Two years after arriving in this East African nation, Wells is
working to open a training center to mass produce inexpensive plows
and harnesses for peasant farmers with U.S.-government money and
land donated by the Kenyan government.
   He expects to open the Mutomo Community Technical Center by
January with an class of 100 students.
   The Kenya Rural Enterprises Program gave Wells nearly $300,000
to build the center and the Kenyan government donated a seven-acre
site. The enterprises program is financed by the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) through World Education Inc. of
Boston to help set up small businesses in rural areas.
   Wells, who comes from Park Ridge, Ill., left Marquette
University in Milwaukee, Wis., in 1951 with a bachelor's degree in
electrical engineering. He worked as a design engineer, managed a
computer chips manufacturing company and helped various companies
automate their operations before establishing his own company,
Wells Automation Products, in Chicago in 1983.
   He closed the business in January 1986, when the economy turned
sour.
   Wells, a widower, said ``the children had gone their seperate
ways,'' so he decided to strike out on his own.
   He joined the Peace Corps, an organization usually staffed by
people a third his age.
   Wells was sent to Kenya in July, 1986, and eventually wound up
in Mutomo, a market town of fewer than 1,000 people 140 miles
southeast of the capital, Nairobi. There, the Danish International
Development Agency had asked other donor governments to help find
someone to run a small operation making harnesses and plows.
   ``I wondered what a man trained in electronics and used to big
plants would do here,'' recalled Wells, a stocky, balding man.
   He spent 10 weeks at the lakeside town of Naivasha for
orientation before coming to Mutomo about 18 months ago. He found
workers turning out crude plows and harnesses by hand.
   ``I was astounded,'' he said. ``The men sat on dirt floors
hacking away at wood with pangas (machetes) and producing beautiful
frames for harnesses.''
   He intends to introduce shop tools and power tools to the
process so the men can make more harnesses and plows at a faster
rate.
   Days are hot and nights chilly in Mutomo, which sits in the
middle of scrubland, rock outcrops and gulleys left by torrential
rains that come twice a year.
   Peasants of the Kamba tribe, mainly women and children because
men seek fortunes elsewhere, try to grow corn, sorghum and millet.
They also graze goats and cattle and keep donkeys.
   But they lack affordable tools, particularly plows.
   Wells pushed the idea for a training center, writing proposals
and seeking money.
   Josephat Muliungi, development coordinator for the Kitui Roman
Catholic Diocese, said the center will be the largest economic
enterprise in Mutomo.
   The area is one of Kenya's poorest; average income for a peasant
farm family is less than $100 a year.
   ``Once the students are gainfully employed, we expect a sizeable
increase in income for at least 1,000 families within a year,''
Muliungi said.
   Wells said the center will continue making harnesses and plows
but in larger quantities and better quality. He hopes to reduce the
price of a plow from the current 450 shillings ($26.50).
   Only 20 of the 100 students will remain at the center after the
year-long training. The others will be organized into groups, given
a little money and sent out to make and repair plows and harnesses
in the villages around Mutomo.
   The center will continue to offer advise on how to run simple
businesses.
   Wells already is looking to expand production to include hand
tools, bicycles, carts and solar-powered radios.
   ``People say it cannot be done,'' he said. ``But I think it can
be done. It is possible.''
   Wells, whose Peace Corps stint has been extended by a year, said
the center can be duplicated in other parts of Kenya and wants to
stay after his Peace Corps time is up.
   ``It is a beautiful thing what I'm doing here,'' he said. ``And
it's good for people like me.
   ``I'm young again. I'm thinking again.''

<DATELINE>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Friday is the best, and worst, day
of the week for Socorro Chavez, a maquiladora mother.
   She is one of the thousands of Mexican women now able to earn
their own livelihoods working in the foreign-owned assembly plants
in northern Mexico known as maquiladoras.
   Maquiladoras have made life better for most of them, but for
others it is still difficult to shake off all of the hard times the
left behind.
   It is that way for Socorro Chavez, just as Friday is her best
day and her worst day.
   When the whir of the plant's sewing machines stops at 5:30 p.m.
on Fridays, Ms. Chavez catches a bus for downtown, then another
that takes her to a children's home.
   It's a two-hour journey across town for a weekly reunion with
her two children, Marco Antonio, 14, and Guadalupe, 10, who stay at
the home while she works.
   That is the best part of Friday, taking the children to her own
small apartment for the weekend.
   The worst part is seeing how the children are outgrowing their
clothes and dodging the landlady who is asking her to vacate the
apartment.
   Then, there's shopping for wholesome food.
   ``The week I have to pay the rent, we don't buy food,'' the
34-year-old mother says.
   Ms. Chavez's husband went to work ``temporarily'' as an illegal
alien in the United States 10 years ago.
   He wrote and sent money home the first year. The frequency of
the letters dropped off and finally stopped.
   He never returned.
   Ms. Chavez, who has just a fifth grade education, moved her
family from the small Chihuahua state town of Namiquipa to the
state capital, the city of Chihuahua, and worked five years there
as a seamstress.
   But, she said, ``I just couldn't make it on what I earned.
Sometimes I would put the children to bed without dinner.
   ``We didn't have heat so I would borrow the neighbor's iron, and
iron the bed to get it warm,'' she said.
   In that way, life has improved for Ms. Chavez and her children
since they stepped off the bus two years ago in Ciudad Juarez, a
city of 1.1 million people just across the border from El Paso,
Texas.
   Ms. Chavez got a job the day after she arrived as a seamstress
in a maquiladora, which makes goods for export, mostly across the
border to the United States.
   For maquiladora owners, the advantage is Mexico's low wages; for
Mexico, it is jobs for its people and increased export income for
its coffers.
   Ms. Chavez makes about 80,000 pesos a week, nearly $35 at an
average exchange rate of 2,300 pesos to the dollar.
   Her job is stitching sections of leather work gloves at Wellmax,
a subsidiary of the Chicago-based glove manufacturer Wells Lamont.
   Her pay is double the mimimum wage in Juarez and more than
triple what she had earned for similar work in Chihuahua.
   Instead of the one-room apartment she and her children had in
Chihuahua, they now have two rooms, two beds and some used
furniture she bought with money she saved from her earnings.
   By staying at the home, the children don't have to spend their
after-school hours in an employee cafeteria waiting for her to
finish work as they did before.
   ``My boss worked hard to help me find a place so the children
could be together during the week,'' she said.
   But, she added, ``Sometimes I get so lonely for them that I go
there and sleep.''
   Wellmex is one of about 200 foreign-owned maquiladoras in
Juarez. More than 330,000 people, the majority of them women, work
in the maquiladora industry that now vies with tourism as the
country's No. 2 source of foreign exchange for Mexico after
petroleum.
   Another maquiladora mother at Wellmax is Ana Maria Lemus,
second-born in a family of 17 children.
   Things now are much better for her and much less difficult than
they are for Ms. Chavez.
   In Ms. Lemus' past life is her father working 30 years as a cook
in a Juarez restaurant while her mother stayed home to care for the
children in a two-room adobe hut.
   ``My mother would cry because we didn't have money for food,''
said Ms. Lemus, now 33.
   At age 15 she dropped out of junior high school in El Paso to
work at cleaning a curios shop. She earned $5 a week.
   ``I had to stop studying to help my parents pay for the other
kids,'' she said.
   When Wellmex opened, she applied for a job.
   She has worked her way up from seamstress to production manager.
   ``With the education I have, if it weren't for the maquiladoras
I'd be working as a maid in El Paso,'' she said.
   Ms. Lemus met her husband at Wellmex and he is now a plant
maintenance supervisor. The couple is rearing two children on a
combined net income of nearly 300,000 pesos a week, about $130.
   They own a car and a three-bedroom, middle-class home they got
through the government's low-cost housing program, Infonavit.
   ``Things are a lot easier now,'' Ms. Lemus said. ``I don't have
to worry whether the kids have hot food.
   ``And they're getting an education. That's the most important
thing.''

   Heading north out of town past farms and
pine stands, one might never notice the Overcomer Campground _
until recently, when television news vans began clustering at the
headquarters of evangelist R.G. Stair's ministry.
   The attention follows reports by families in the Philadelphia
area that their children have abandoned their lives for a Christian
cult, and their allegations that cult members can't leave because
Stair controls their money.
   The allegations are denied by Stair, a 51-year-old Pennsylvania
native who, like other members of the Faith Cathedral Fellowship,
lives in a renovated mobile home set among the tall oaks and pines
near this town about 50 miles from Charleston.
   ``We have a good lifestyle here,'' he said. ``We believe in the
Christian principle of having food and raiment, be content.''
   The ministry is headquartered in a nondescript brown-roofed
motel building along U.S. 15. Beside it is a modest brown building,
which is the congregation's tabernacle.
   Worshippers sit on folding white wood chairs each Friday evening
and Saturday morning to hear Stair's sermons of Bible prophecy
delivered from a podium on a red-carpeted riser. Behind the podium
is a small room in which the evangelist records his radio programs
carried on 50 stations nationwide.
   A few miles farther north is the sect's 74-acre farm, where 37
people are busy farming and renovating house trailers.
   The farm has a five-acre plot where residents raise everything
from turnips to squash and watermelon. Nearby are a kitchen and
dining hall where residents gather for prayers and share their
meals.
   Despite the allegations the group espouses survivalism, there's
no indication of any weapons or military dress among the residents
of the ministry, where a sign requests there be ``No Smoking, No
Drinking and No Swearing.''
   A number have their own bank accounts and vehicles. There is no
fence, but a free-standing gate at the motel keeps cars from
swerving into the parking lot at night.
   Visitors can stay without charge, but there are some
requirements for those who want to stay permanently, Stair said.
   ``We want to make sure they believe in the Christian faith like
we do,'' he said.
   They must also be debt-free, because ``it's not right for me to
take other people's money and pay your debts,'' he added.
   The ministry takes in about $30,000 a month, Stair said, adding
he pays about $20,000 monthly for radio air time. Since the
challenges to his ministry were raised, several stations have taken
the fiery Overcomer broadcast off the air.
   Stair has predicted that President Reagan won't complete his
term in office, there'll be an economic shakeup beginning next
month and there'll be a limited nuclear war before the year is out.
   ``I believe God speaks to me,'' he said in a broadcast prepared
for this weekend. ``That's one of the issues they have taken up
with me. But how many of you Christians out there in radio land
believe God speaks to you?''
   Stair said the religious community is not a survivalist enclave,
noting ``we've got a Navy base over there (in Charleston) with
submarines. If they're going to blow us up, they're going to blow
us up. There is no human protection from a nuclear war.''
   The sect does have a food storehouse, stocked with several
thousand pounds of food. It's for the congregation's use and is
also given away to the needy.
   Stair, who is called Brother Stair by the congregation, was
ordained a Methodist minister. Now, he said, ``I won't identify
with any organized religion. I just call myself a Christian.''
   He said the Lord told him to move South 30 years ago ``because
the safest place for Christians in the end time is going to be the
South.'' He has lived in Walterboro for 10 years.
   Much of the recent controversy has centered on the move of Gerry
and Linda McCourt of Drexel Hill, Pa., to the community.
   Gloria Ahern, Mrs. McCourt's mother, said Stair's prophecy of a
nuclear war inspired them to quickly sell their home and belongings
and head to South Carolina.
   She and others in the Philadelphia area have called for
investigations by the IRS and the FBI.
   But Mrs. McCourt said, ``We just wanted to move to a quieter
place.''
   She said the couple had planned to sell their house and, when a
buyer offered them $60,000 cash, they decided to take it. Real
estate agents had earlier offered to list the house for $74,000 and
$65,000, she said.
   Mrs. McCourt, who is expecting her second child in June, said
she leads a different life from her mother. She said she and her
husband don't watch television or go to movies and on vacations
were likely to go to Christian retreats.
   She said when she arrived in South Carolina, she called home to
let her mother know where the family was.
   ``All she kept saying was, `You're sick,''' she said. ``There
was no having a conversation.''
   But Mrs. McCourt said her mother is welcome to visit. ``I wish
she would come down here. We have no malice.''
   Stair said that if his critics in Pennsylvania were to visit,
``There would be no question of whether I'm making their people
stay here or not. Whether they would still approve of the lifestyle
is a different story.''
   Gerry McCourt said the family felt it was time for a change long
before they had heard of Stair.
   ``We wanted something more out in the country, a slower way of
life,'' he added.
   In Pennsylvania their church group ate together and had church
five times a week, so ``our lifestyle hasn't changed that much
except we lived in the suburbs and we might have had a little bit
more,'' he said.
   Dave Moratto, another member of the Walterboro congregation,
worked for a livestock dealer in Florida for 25 years before coming
to South Carolina last summer.
   ``I feel this is where the Lord would have me to be,'' he said
as he cleaned turnips in a sink outside the group kitchen. ``People
do it every day in Florida _ sell what they have and move about.''
   Shirley Roe, who originally came from Austin, Texas, said she
and her husband and son were living in a Volkswagen bus in North
Dakota last winter when they decided to come to Walterboro.
   ``We'd been seeking the Lord's will. He was telling us his will
by telling us to come here,'' she said as she helped prepare dinner.
   Chief Deputy R.F. Stevens of the Colleton County Sheriff's
Department said that in recent weeks, the department had received a
number of calls from relatives of members of the community.
   ``We try to contact them and tell them to call home,'' he said.
   ``We have no indication of wrongdoing,'' he said, adding, ``It's
just a situation that bears watching.''

   Nestle SA knows that if its $3.9 billion bid for
Rowntree PLC is successful, it will have immediate access to the
masses of consumers who chomp down 30 million Kit Kat bars every
week.
   Rather than going to its own kitchen and tinkering with new
recipes to tempt the average sweet tooth, Swiss-based Nestle will
rely on Rowntree's tried-and-true formulae for Kit Kat, the world's
second best selling chocolate product, and other candy favorites
like After Eight mints and Rollos.
   As the takeover epidemic spreads to consumer product companies,
these firms find buying a successful product rather than trying to
invent one is cheaper and the fastest way to the customer.
   But some experts wonder whether product research and innovation
will fall by the wayside as this latest strategy for gaining market
share takes hold.
   Recently on the takeover scene, the same rationale of buying
into success was the driving force for West Point-Pepperell Inc.,
which will acquire state-of-the-art sheet and towel plants as well
as hot designer brand names through its $1.22 billion acquisition
of rival textile maker J.P. Stevens & Co.
   And Cartier SA, the French luxury products concern, unveiled
plans to acquire a controlling interest in two Swiss watchmakers, a
move that ensures it will control 40 percent of the international
market for expensive watches.
   Even General Electric Co. recently decided to buy into the gas
stove market by acquiring Roper Corp., rather than go out and set
up its own gas range operation.
   ``GE has all the resources to compete and develop new products
and break into new markets, but it's cheaper to do it through the
stock market,'' noted Donald Margotta, an assistant professor at
Northeastern University in Boston.
   The cost of introducing a new product that will appeal to a
broad public palate is extremely high. ``Definitely in today's
market, entry is very expensive,'' said Israel Shaked, a professor
of finance at Boston University's School of Management.
   A product like computer software, for example, has a narrowly
defined target market, making it possible to start at the fringes
of the market and gradually build up interest.
   ``But with consumer products, it doesn't work that way,'' Shaked
said. ``You have to implement a full-fledged ad campaign for any
product you want to place on the shelf. Spreading the word is much
costlier when you're talking about every household, rather than the
5 percent of households that use computer spreadsheets.''
   A consumer product ``is only as good as when it reaches the
consumer,'' said Edward de Boisgelin, an international food and
beverage analyst at the securities firm Smith Barney, Harris Upham
& Co.
   ``And it's only good if it has high volume. The hit is a
combination of a few things _ a good product, good marketing ...
and good distribution,'' he said.
   In the case of Nestle, whose bid for Britain's Rowntree this
past week challenged a competing offer from Jacobs Suchard AG of
Switzerland, success would be guaranteed.
   ``The main positive for Nestle is to go from low market share in
the United Kingdom to a 20-25 percent share overnight,'' de
Boisgelin said. ``To achieve that otherwise would require money and
years'' of product development and positioning.
   Some estimates have put the consumer product failure rate as
high as 95 percent. But marketing experts continue to refine the
figure based on when a product is labeled a bust _ whether that
occurs while an idea is still on the drawing board, after a
prototype product gets to a shelf, or somewhere in between.
   A majority of products that get to the commercial launch stage
actually do manage to survive, experts say. But developing a
trusted brand name takes years of nurturing.
   Some experts fear what the takeover trend might mean for product
development efforts and quality control. Companies may find it
``worthwhile to delay the introduction of technology and milk
profits if they have a stranglehold on the market,'' Margotta said.
   In addition, employees who are ``involved for 20, 30 years in
creating high-quality products can be the very people thrown out in
a takeover,'' he said.
   But de Boisgelin disagrees. He contends mergers could increase
product innovation because ``the bigger you are, the more money you
can spend on R&D.''
   Experts say consumers will be little affected by the recent
acquisitions of companies selling every-day products. Calvin Klein
sheets will still be available at the local department store,
regardless of whether Pepperell or Stevens is making them.

   While the companies initiating takeovers are sure to reap some
savings by consolidating operations like administration, accounting
and even distribution, those savings aren't likely to be passed on
to the consumer.
   Instead, experts say, companies with a commanding share of the
market might even be in a position to boost prices.
   ``I don't think the consumer will be directly affected
immediately,'' Shaked said. ``The benefit will be for shareholders,
not consumers.''
   According to economic reports this past week:
   _The government's chief forecasting gauge of future economic
activity shot up 0.8 percent in March, pointing to continued growth
for the rest of the year.
   _Americans' personal incomes posted the biggest gain last month
since December, while consumer spending jumped a healthy 0.7
percent.
   _Strong consumer spending helped the nation's economy grow at a
healthy 2.3 percent annual rate during the first three months of
1988.
   _Sales of new single-family homes rose 4 percent in March, the
second consecutive monthly improvement following a post-stock crash
slump. Sales of existing homes edged up 2.5 percent in March for
the second month in a row.
   _Wage and benefit increases for the 12 months ended in March
averaged 4.1 percent, compared with 3.4 percent during the previous
12 months.
   _Employment in manufacturing businesses fell by 4 percent
between 1982 and 1986, but transportation equipment, plastics and
furniture continue to draw workers.
   _Sales of domestically produced cars and light trucks rose
slightly in mid-April to 353,314 units, from 308,240 units in the
year-ago last year.

   _The Senate voted 63-36 to approve and send to the White House a
sweeping trade bill, but supporters fell short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override a threatened presidential veto.
   _Chrysler Corp. said it would delay closing a Wisconsin assembly
plant and would continue building the K-car in the United States
instead of Mexico, clearing major obstacles to an early contract

   _Farmers Group Inc., facing a hostile $4.5 billion bid from
Batus Inc., said its board had ended talks on a possible leveraged
buyout and would prefer that the company stay independent.
   _Lucky Stores Inc. agreed to a $2.2 billion leveraged buyout led
by the New York investment firm Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.,
spurning a takeover bid by American Stores Inc.
   _Bank of New York Co. said nearly half of Irving Bank Corp.'s
outstanding shares had been tendered under its $1 billion-plus
hostile buyout offer, giving it an apparent edge in its battle to
acquire Irving.
   _Rhode Island's Citizens Financial Group Inc. agreed to be
acquired for $440 million by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the sixth
largest banking group in the United Kingdom.
   _The special inspection of Eastern and Continental airlines
uncovered no ``grossly unsafe'' conditions so far, although planes
were ordered out of service briefly because of safety infractions
about 5 percent of the time, the Federal Aviation Administration
said. Eastern announced fare cuts that executives hope will restore
a ridership that has lagged since federal inspectors launched the

   A Fulton County grand jury refused to indict Willie J. Nash, a
Fulton sheriff's deputy who shot and killed Alvin Lamar Montgomery,
19, last Sept. 3.
   Nash said he was serving a warrant at a southwest Atlanta
address when Montgomery drove his 1977 Buick toward him at high
speed. Nash told investigators he fired at Montgomery's car, which
jumped the curb and crashed into a nearby house. A bullet struck
Montgomery in the back of the head; he died two days later.
   Fulton County District Attorney Lewis Slaton said he offered the
grand jury a chance to indict Nash, an eight-year law enforcement
veteran, on murder and aggravated assault charges. Fulton Sheriff
Richard Langford fired Nash, saying the shooting was not justified.

stealing his stepfather's car. Before a large crowd in a field,
Callahan was shot six times at point-blank range while struggling
for Watson's gun.
   The officers were suspended with pay, and Long was eventually
acquitted of involuntary manslaughter. Watson, who was not
indicted, was dismissed after police officials cited several other
excessive force complaints, all filed before the Callahan shooting.

   The mood in this 87-family neighborhood adjacent to the
Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, already irritated about
losing a $1.3 million relocation grant after a city buyout, grew
surly when police shot Baxter Lee Williams on Feb. 27.
   Williams, 23, had just left a local hangout with his brother,
witnesses said. Police who saw the shooting said Williams pulled a
handgun, but no weapon was confiscated. Witnesses said Williams was
holding a beer can when he was killed; police found the beer can.
   In March, Slaton decided not to prosecute the officer involved
in the shooting. Residents blasted Mayor Andrew Young at an April
community meeting, saying the mayor, a longtime civil rights
leader, and his administration had no concern for the city's poor.

   There were no witnesses to the April 8 shooting of Victor Long
behind a house on Fielding Lane, a shady street lined with
comfortable homes occupied by black, middle-class families.
   Long, in his 20s, was being chased by police when he was shot by
Officer R.S. Creasy. Creasy was patrolling a wooded area for a
burglary suspect when he saw Long sitting under a tree, trying to
catch his breath. Creasy, who said Long fit the description of his
suspect, chased Long through the woods, then tried to subdue him.
Long wrestled a second gun from a holster at Creasy's ankle, police
said, and Creasy shot Long five times.
   Lt. R.J. Anglin said several residents of the neighborhood,
which had been plagued by thefts, ``came out and patted us on the
back.'' Creasy was placed on mandatory 10-day administrative duties
pending the outcome of homicide and internal affairs investigations.

   Trouble at Bowen Homes on March 30 did not result in death but
did raise tension between police and the city's black citizens. An
attempt by two police officers to arrest Tommy George for a traffic
violation turned the normally quiet housing project chaotic.
   A crowd, described by police as large and unruly, gathered to
watch. Once George was handcuffed and put in a police car, Idella
Gibson, whose son was killed by police in 1974, demanded George's
release, then seemed to have a seizure, police said. George managed
to flee while the officers were attending Ms. Gibson. The crowd
then began throwing rocks and broken bottles, damaging several
police cars.
   A similar disturbance followed within days in the McDaniel-Glen
housing project. The next day, ministers working through the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference urged Slaton to reverse
his decision not to prosecute in the Williams shooting, hoping to
restore order in the housing projects.

   In their search for some likely event to break
the recent stalemate in the stock market, many analysts are looking
to next Friday's report on employment.
   Wall Streeters expect the Labor Department data to set the tone
for the numerous other statistics on the economy for April that
will be issued over the next several weeks.
   They also believe the Federal Reserve will take a close look at
the numbers as it considers what monetary policies it should pursue.
   Public notice focuses most directly on the unemployment rate,
which dropped to 5.6 percent in March, hitting its lowest level
since July 1979.
   Participants in the securities markets, however, pay more
attention to other elements of the report _ for instance, the net
change in what the government calls ``non-farm payrolls.''
   This number is closely watched as a gauge of the economy's
overall strength _ and of the prospective outlook for interest
rates and inflation.
   Thus, while strong growth in employment is a positive for
consumer spending and near-term corporate profits, it is also
viewed as a potential negative for stock prices.
   Payroll employment grew by a larger-than-expected 262,000
workers in March.
   ``Recent trends in initial claims for unemployment insurance
suggest that the April non-farm payroll gain will be at least
200,000,'' said Mitchell Held, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   In Held's appraisal, the Federal Reserve would like to see
strength in the economy concentrated in the manufacturing sector.
Manufacturing jobs registered a slight decline in March.
   By now, many followers of the securities markets are used to the
``good news is bad news'' reasoning that Wall Street often applies
to statistics such as the employment figures.
   Nevertheless, even hardened veterans of the game acknowledge
there is something dramatic right now in the difference between the
apparently robust state of the economy and the rampant pessimism in
the markets.
   ``Catatonic ... paralyzed ... numb could all be used to describe
the average investor in recent months,'' said James Stack in his
advisory letter InvesTech.
   ``Those who are out of the market are too terrified of another
crash to step in. Investors who were heavily invested in the crash
are just as afraid of not recouping their losses if they jump out
now.''
   In the past week, which produced some of the quietest trading
days of the year to date, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
managed a 17.24 gain to 2,032.33.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.30 to 148.33;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
increased 5.20 to 379.24; and the American Stock Exchange market
value index gained 5.11 to 303.14.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 141.47 million shares a day,
down from 155.02 million the week before.
   From the mid-1960s through the mid-'80s, May and June acquired a
well-earned reputation as a perilous period for stock prices, with
numerous and sometimes sharp declines.
   Yale Hirsch, publisher of the Stock Trader's Almanac, dubbed it
the ``May-June disaster area.''
   But whether this pattern was a product of mere coincidence or
the result of some force undiscernable to the ordinary mortal, it
seems to have been broken in the last three years.
   From the end of April to the end of June, the Dow Jones
industrials rose 6.2 percent in 1985; 6.1 percent in 1986, and 5.8
percent in 1987, according to Hirsch's reckoning.

<HEAD>Congress Turns Spotlight on `Junk' Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress turned its spotlight of scrutiny on
``junk'' bonds this past week, and the head of the investment firm
that pioneered the controversial issues defended them staunchly.
   In 6{ hours of testimony Thursday before a House investigative
subcommittee, Frederick H. Joseph, the chief executive of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., also defended the firm against allegations of
manipulation of the $160 billion junk bond market.
   Drexel, a leading Wall Street investment firm, is the granddaddy
of the high-yield, high-risk bonds and underwrites around 40
percent of all junk bonds issued.
   The securities are designed to allow companies without a track
record of earnings to get financing based on whether they have
sufficient cash flow to pay off their debts. They pay higher
interest rates than those of established companies and are viewed
as riskier investments.
   Michael Milken, chief of Drexel's junk bond trading unit in
Beverly Hills, Calif., who pioneered the bonds, was a lot less
talkative than Joseph at a hearing Wednesday before the
investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.
   Milken, who has been under investigation for the past year and a
half by a federal grand jury that is reported to be probing insider
trading, refused to testify and cited his Fifth Amendment
protection against self-incrimination.
   Behind the spotlight, the junk bond market seems to have quietly
risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the October stock market
collapse, as worries about a recession have subsided.
   The resurgence of corporate ``takeover fever'' earlier this year
also gave junk bonds a shot in the arm, since many of the issues
are used to finance acquisitions.
   Some of the companies that have used junk bond financing, such
as businesses in the steel and chemical industries, have performed
well recently _ helped by a weaker dollar that made their exports
more attractive. After the crash, there had been concern that
failures of vulnerable companies could cast a shadow on the junk
bond market.
   ``There's an ongoing need for high-yield securities,'' said
Robert Waill, a managing director of investment firm L.F.
Rothschild & Co. and the head of its junk bond research department.
   Waill believes more funds will be attracted to junk bonds in the
coming months, as investors switch big sums of money now parked in
money-market funds into high-yield mutual funds featuring junk
bonds. The money-market funds, based on prevailing interest rates
on Treasury bonds, have been yielding relatively low returns
recently.
   Junk bonds are purchased mainly by big financial institutions,
and most individual investors buy them through high-yield mutual
funds.
   The bad publicity now surrounding the bonds _ with congressional
investigators portraying Drexel as a greedy firm that elbowed its
own clients aside so top employees could profit on hot new issues _
won't hurt the market, traders insist.
   ``This has been going on for 18 months; it's a little
anti-climactic by now,'' Waill said, referring to investigations of
junk bond trading and the congressional hearings.
   Drexel's Joseph told the House panel he expects the junk bond
market to expand substantially over the next 10 years, since less
than 10 percent of the companies that could get financing by
issuing the high-yield bonds have done so.
   In the last 10 years, the market has grown explosively, from
less than $25 billion in junk bonds in 1977 to around $160 billion
last year _ or 25 percent of the $650 billion corporate debt market.
   Joseph pointed to cable television as an example of an industry
ripe for the bonds, saying cable companies tend to have low
earnings because of their high investment costs initially but also
have great profit potential.
   The average company issuing junk bonds is about 36 years old,
has around $1 billion in assets and employs more than 4,000 people,
Drexel says.

<HEAD>Wall Street, Bond Market Ignore Good Economic News</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A double dose of good economic news failed to inspire the
nation's financial markets, which worried more about inflation and
ended the week by heading down.
   The Commerce Department said Friday that its Index of Leading
Indicators rose 0.8 percent in March, the second straight big
monthly gain. Some economists said the figure eliminated chances of
a recession in 1988 and thereby boosted the Republican chances for
winning the presidential election.
   New home sales also rose in March for the second straight month,
the Commerce Department said. The 4 percent gain strengthened
arguments that the housing industry has revived following a slump
in the aftermath of the October stock market crash.
   Nevertheless, some analysts said the sales level could fade
later this year because of rising mortgage rates, a consequence of
a slow upward move in interest rates over the past several weeks.
   Others said economic strength also means a probable rise in
inflation, which could compel the Federal Reserve to tighten credit
conditions.
   It is the rise in inflation that worries investors in the stock
and bond markets, which largely ignored the news on the economy
Friday and instead retreated.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
dropped 8.95 points to 2,032.33.
   In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of inflation and
interest rate trends, the key 30-year Treasury bond lost about
$1.25 in face amount, and its yield edged up slightly to 9.09
percent.
   The economic news helped the value of the dollar, which rose
slightly against most key currencies. But some traders said the
dollar's behavior also was a reaction to the evidence of rising
interest rates, which makes dollar-denominated assets more valuable.

   Oil futures prices sagged then bounced back in
nervous trading that reflected the uncertain outcome of a key OPEC
meeting.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer of
price trends, traders remained wary Friday of guessing results of
the meeting of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
ministers in Vienna, Austria.
   The ministers were trying to develop a strategy to jointly
reduce output with eight non-OPEC producers in order to erase
excess supplies from the market.
   Contracts for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, closed 1 cent higher at $17.99 per 42-gallon
barrel Friday, after having been down as much as 43 cents.
   Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 0.16
cent per gallon to 51.67 cents, and wholesale heating oil rose 0.82
cent a gallon to 51.79 cents.
   James Steel, a strategist at the Refco Inc. commodities firm,
said oil prices dropped sharply early in the session because of
what he called carryover selling from Thursday over the lack of
significant news from the OPEC meeting.
   After prices fell so quickly, some traders saw buying
opportunities and the market quickly moved up. That prompted other
traders who had sold borrowed oil on the hunch prices would fall to
buy it back, a price-boosting influence known as short-covering.
   Donald Morton, an analyst at the Boston office of
Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc., called the late-session
bounceback a ``pre-weekend, short-covering rally.''
