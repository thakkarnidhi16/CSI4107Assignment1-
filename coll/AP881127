   A new OPEC agreement to limit oil
production and maintain the cartel's benchmark at $18 a barrel was
jeopardized Sunday when Saudi Arabia apparently demanded a $15 to
$18 price range, officials said.
   ``Iran is not going to accept this type of idea,'' said F.
Barkeshli, a senior Iranian delegate to the winter conference of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The new proposal, he
said, ``will complicate and it could jeopardize the whole deal.''
   Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh announced earlier Sunday
in Tehran that his government had agreed to the new production pact.
His statement was carried by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency and monitored in Cyprus.
   But Barkeshli said Aghazadeh had signed on to a preliminary draft
that would maintain the cartel's benchmark at $18 a barrel.
   He said he learned Sunday morning about a new proposal calling
for a band of prices with a range of $15 to $18 a barrel. Other
officials said the plan was floated by Saudi Arabia, which maintains
the largest oil production share at about one-quarter the cartel's
total output.
   ``The proposal that was put to the minister when he was here did
not have anything like $15,'' he said.
   ``Now people are introducing new elements into the package which
was agreed by the minister,'' he said. He said the Iranian Cabinet
approved the original draft with the $18 target price. ``Iran,'' he
said, ``would not shoulder the responsibility of any complications.''
   He said other countries, including Algeria and Nigeria, were not
supporting the price band. The ministers apparently fear a floor of
$15 would effectively become the target level, rather than the
higher, $18 price.
   Barkeshli also said Aghazadeh was not expected to return to
Vienna.
   The minister left Friday morning to get his government's
permission to sign the new accord which would limit the cartel's
output and drive up prices.
   Barkeshli made his remarks on the way to a meeting with OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman. The ministers had been scheduled to resume
their winter meeting Sunday but the talks were now put in doubt.
   The proposed deal would trim current production by about 4
million barrels a day from the present 22.5 million barrels in the
first half of 1989.
   It also would retain the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   Prices have been running about $4 below that because of a market
glut. The new accord is aimed at curbing overproduction and raising
prices.
   Each one-dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoretically
means an increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices
for the U.S. consumer, although oil companies do not always pass
along the full increase.
   Many analysts fear the effort by OPEC to limit oil production, if
successful, will worsen inflationary pressures in the United States
at least temporarily and put more upward pressure on interest rates.
   That would mean slower growth next year and make President-elect
George Bush's effort to trim the federal deficit without tax
increases even harder, these analysts said.
   The OPEC ministers began meeting Monday but adjourned for
closed-door talks to try to end a bitter dispute between rivals Iran
and Iraq. The two nations signed a cease-fire in August to end their
8-year war, a conflict with 1 million casualties that was paid for
with oil export revenues.
   Iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with Iran in
any new accord. Under the new pact, Iran and Iraq would get the same
quota of 2.64 million barrels a day.
   Iran would retain its production share at 14.27 percent of total
output. Other countries would give up some of their share to bring
Iraq to the same level as Iran.
   Saudi Arabia maintains the largest share at about one-quarter the
cartel's total output.

   Iran said Sunday it is suspending
prisoner-of-war exchanges with Iraq until Baghdad sends back the
number of Iranian POWs it promised to return under an agreement with
Red Cross officials.
   The suspension of the Red Cross-sponsored repatriation of sick
and disabled prisoners from the Persian Gulf war was announced by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The report was monitored
in Nicosia.
   The International Committee for the Red Cross said Iran and Iraq
freed 71 disabled soldiers on Sunday _ 19 Iranians and 52 Iraqis _
in the third such exchange under the program this week.
   Iran has freed fewer prisoners than agreed, claiming that some
Iraqis sought asylum and others had recovered from their wounds and
no longer were eligible. In retaliation, Iraq has released fewer
Iranian POWs than promised.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 250 residents evacuated when a
train derailment caused the leak of more than 15,000 gallons of a
toxic liquid began returning home Sunday after authorities lifted an
evacuation order.
   Firefighter Bruce Messer of the Tyler Fire Department hazardous
materials response team said authorities officially lifted an
evacuation order, issued late Friday as a precaution, at 11:20 p.m.
Saturday.
   Crews remained at the scene early Sunday to continue clean-up
operations, but Messer said the danger to residents had passed.
   At the Best Western Canton Inn about 12 miles northeast of here,
desk clerk Marcie Nix said evacuees who had stayed there began
leaving after dawn.
   ``Some of them have already checked out ...,'' Ms. Nix said early
Sunday. ``They'll be glad to get home. Some of them were in their
housecoats when they were evacuated and that's all they wore for
three days.'' She added that the railroad paid for the evacuees'
rooms and meals.
   Authorities still do not know what caused the Union Pacific
freight train en route to Fort Worth from New Orleans to derail
about 7:30 p.m. Friday. A tornado had been spotted in the area about
the time some 35 cars on the 89-car train derailed along a mile of
track.
   Among the cars thatd erailed was one filled with 30,000 gallons
of anhydrous ammonia, a toxic liquid farm fertilizer. Messer said
all but 14,000 gallons of the ammonia had seeped from the car before
authorities could control the spill.
   Another car, containing chlorine, was damaged but did not leak,
authorities said.

   Hundreds of tons of building materials have been
stolen from the construction site for the 1990 Asian Games, an
official report said Sunday.
   An estimated 213 tons of plundered steel, copper and other
materials have reached the market, the Workers' Daily said.
   Authorities this year have imposed more than 600 fines and
reprimanded the thieves, including local residents, peddlars and
construction workers, the newspaper said. It did not say if anyone
had been jailed.
   The newspaper said the theft occurred at the Asian Games Village,
a compound in northern Beijing that includes athletes' housing, two
hotels, a convention center, a track, a swimming pool and other
athletic facilities.
   China will be the host for the quadrennial games for the first
time and about 6,000 athletes are expected to attend the country's
biggest sports event ever.
   Theft at construction sites in China is common because of the
scarcity of steel, wire and other building materials.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers on Sunday unearthed villages
buried in mud slides after a week of heavy rains that caused
Thailand's worst natural disaster in recent decades, officials said.
   They said 370 bodies were found, but at least 800 people are
believed dead from the floods that hit 12 southern provinces, said
Col. Bunchorn Chavarnsil, spokesman for the Fourth Army region.
   He said 689 people were injured, 305 others were missing and
thousands were homeless.
   About 14,000 people have remained in emergency relief centers,
down from the 60,000 people at the height of the floods, he said.
   Ten helicopters and 12 boats transported the troops and rescue
teams Sunday to villages in the southern Nakhon Sri Thammarat
province, the worst hit area, Bunchorn said. He said planes dropped
food and supplies to isolated villages.
   Skies were clear in the province Sunday after heavy rains
Saturday night, he said.
   Half the deaths were in Nakhon Sri Thammarat's Phipoon district,
where mud and logs charged down barren hillsides, slamming into
homes and crushing people, Bunchhorn said.
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan visited the disaster areas
Friday and Saturday and pledged $120 million in relief aid. He
ordered the agriculture minister to investigate the uncontrolled
logging and mining that had stripped the hillsides, contributing to
the mudslides.
   Government spokesman Suvit Yodmani said Chatichai and Foreign
Minister Siddhi Savetsila hoped for aid from other countries.
   On Saturday, the head of the Thailand office of the U.S. Agency
for International Development, John R. Eriksson, toured the
afflicted areas in Nakhon Sri Thammarat with other U.S. Embassy
officials and a Canadian official. The U.S. team sent a cable to
Washington on Saturday recommending material assistance, the U.S.
Embassy spokesman, Ross Petzing, said Sunday.
   He said U.S. Ambassador Daniel O'Donohue will hand over an
initial donation of $25,000 on Monday.
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan reported
Sunday that torrential rain caused the Batang Natal River to
overflow in Natal District, about 940 miles northwest of the
Indonesian capital.
   It said thousands residents in four villages were forced to
evacuate when the river overflowed Friday, and five people were
missing.
   No officials in the area could be reached Sunday for comment.

<TEXT>
   President-elect George Bush is getting advice
from aides and former presidents and from think tanks and lobbyists
in reports that stretch from 50 to 1,000 pages with covers that
range from no-nonsense navy to peppermint striped.
   Much of the advice is unsolicited, and much goes unheeded and
unread, no matter how flashy the cover or how hard the pitch.
   ``Whether they get a hearing depends entirely on their political
clout,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution. ``If they're read at all, they will be read by pretty
low-level transition people.''
   Many of the reports are ``done for other reasons than influencing
the president-elect _ like getting news media publicity,'' he says.
   Advising an incoming administration has become a cottage
industry, in part due to the success of the conservative Heritage
Foundation's 1980 ``Mandate for Leadership,'' which was a blueprint
for much of the agenda of President Reagan's first term.
   The transition is a ``seminal period in a presidency,'' said
Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was a top domestic policy aide to President
Jimmy Carter.
   ``The legislative priorities, the budget you develop, have a
great deal to say about the first year and indeed your entire term.
People have begun to realize that,'' he said.
   Here's a sampling of the dozens of books, magazines, pamphlets,
reports, letters, panel discussions and briefings:
   _The government's General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress, published 26 separate unsolicited reports on issues
facing the new administration ranging from defense to banking to
transportation, the first time it had done so. The reports were
bound in navy blue.
   _The Heritage Foundation has published a 953-page ``Mandate for
Leadership III,'' that updates its past policy prescriptions.
Heritage advised Bush, among other things, to give his vice
president, Dan Quayle, a key role in dealing with Congress; not to
joke on television with congressional adversaries; and give short,
businesslike State of the Union Speeches. The foundation also
supplied the resumes of more than 10,000 conservatives it would like
in the new administration.
   _The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a moderate
think tank, packaged its 50 pages of advice on the transition
process in bright red with a white stripe across the corner. The
document has been dubbed ``The Peppermint Papers.''
   _Former presidents Carter and Gerald Ford offered recommendations
on ways to reduce the federal deficit by cutting spending and
raising taxes on beer, wine, cigarettes and motor fuel.
   Bush said last week he was ``open-minded in terms of hearing from
all these people,'' but would follow his own counsel.
   ``We're always willing to take advice from others as long as they
understand there's no guarantee the president-elect will accept
it,'' said David Prosperi, a Bush spokesman.
   Some groups try the hard sell.
   ``We cover all the bases. Every time a name is mentioned in the
media as a potential candidate, we make certain a copy is given to
that individual that day,'' said Curtis Farmer of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
   The center delivered copies to Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis
two weeks before the election.
   Farmer said that because no one on the transition team has much
time for reading, CSIS scholars decided to keep their report to
under 50 pages, with no section taking more than 10 minutes to read.
   ``I think we approached this in a very cagey manner,'' he said.
   Burton Pines, senior vice president at Heritage, said that policy
suggestions often sell themselves to harried policy makers who are
``always looking for an efficient way of getting data and ideas.''
   ``We have over 1,000 recommendations. That is a gift to any
policy maker,'' Pines said. ``He'll come into the office cold. He's
got to hit the ground running. He'll open our chapter on his
department and it'll be laid out almost irresistibly.''

   It took most of a neighborhood to bring
Anna Lynn Li into this world, but everyone involved says it was
worth it.
   Anna Lynn was born in the back seat of a car late Thanksgiving
night on the city's east side as friends and neighbors helped with
blankets and boiling water.
   Harriett Brown said she was awakened at about 11:15 p.m. when Man
Chuang Li knocked on her door and said his wife, Feng Juan Li, was
in labor.
   ``He came to the door and he said, `Call the hospital,''' Ms.
Brown said. ``When I got out to the car, she was in labor. I said,
`You've got to push. You're having the baby now!'''
   About 15 people gathered to help in the delivery, witnesses said.
   ``It was a beautiful scene,'' neighbor Louis Lugo said.
``Everyone was out there half-naked in their pajamas helping. It's
like the community did it.
   ``I was boiling water for no reason. I had a pot of boiling
water, but I didn't know what for. I did it because that's what they
always do on television.''
   An emergency squad took Mrs. Li and Anna Lynn to Grant Medical
Center, where they spent a day before being released.
   Ms. Brown said that despite all the excitement, her Thanksgiving
Day ended better than it had begun.
   ``When I got up at 7 in the morning to cook a 25-pound turkey and
my oven blew up, I thought it was going to be a bad day,'' she said.
``But it turned out pretty good.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Majority Democrats gained only a single Senate
seat in this month's elections, but the chamber is likely to undergo
a personality change with the choosing of a new majority leader this
week.
   The current majority leader, Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., is stepping
down to assume the chairmanship of the powerful Senate
Appropriations Committee, taking with him his unparalleled
parliamentary expertise and an un-telegenic courtly style.
   Running to replace him in one of the toughest elections they will
ever face are Sens. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, J. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., and George Mitchell, D-Maine. The election takes place
Tuesday.
   While they can't match Byrd's knowledge of the rules, the
candidates have appealed to fellow Democrats with promises to keep
the ungainly institution on an efficient schedule, and to make other
reforms.
   And Democrats hope that, unlike the somewhat stiff Byrd, the new
majority leader will have a popular appeal that emanates to the
nation beyond Capitol Hill as Congress does battle over the budget
with a new Republican president.
   Inouye, 64, is the oldest of the three and the most senior in the
Senate, having first been elected in 1962.
   ``My experience, my seniority, should be in my favor,'' Inouye
said in appearance with his two rivals Sunday on NBC's Meet the
Press.
   While he won praise for his eloquence and incisiveness during the
1973 Watergate hearings, Inouye's reputation was seen by some to be
tarnished when the Iran-Contra hearings he helped direct turned into
a televised platform for White House aide Oliver North. He also ran
into criticism for inserting in a spending bill $8 million in
federal aid for a schools for North African Jews living in France.
   Predicting a winner in the three-way contest is considered risky,
but Inouye, once the favorite, now is considered the long shot.
   Johnston is perhaps most like Byrd in his command of the
legislative labyrinth, but he is also the most public in pushing for
change.
   The 56-year-old senator, in his third term, has been rapidly
gaining influence. He is chairman of the Energy and Natural
Resources Committee and chairman of the Appropriations energy
subcommittee. In the last Congress, he often handled difficult bills
on the Senate floor for retiring appropriations chairman John
Stennis, D-Miss.
   Johnston has the support of Southern senators including Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, and Sam Nunn, D-Ga. If that conservative wing of
the party is ascendant, Johnston, a moderate, could help move the
Democrats' image away from liberal one that seems to hurt them in
national elections.
   ``Clearly my centrist approach is an advantage,'' Johnston said
on NBC. ``It would be a good message for the country, it would be a
good message for the Democratic Party.''
   George Mitchell, 55, has only been in the Senate for eight years
but has quickly developed a reputation as a thoughtful and
well-spoken lawmaker.
   Unlike Inouye, the former prosecutor and federal judge saw his
reputation grow as a result of the Iran-Contra investigation.
Afterward he coauthored a book on the subject with his Maine
colleague, Republican Senator William Cohen.
   Like Johnston, Mitchell has been chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, and during his tenure the party
regained control of the Senate after the 1986 elections. The post is
tailor-made for doing favors for other senators, the kind of chits
that come in handy during a leadership battle.
   Mitchell's voting record isn't quite as liberal as Inouye's, and
some see him as a choice that could point to the future for
traditional Democratic ideals.
   All three, however, say they believe the race isn't about
philosophy.
   One of the major issues facing the nation is the budget deficit.
All said Sunday it will be up to President-elect George Bush to make
the first move to deal with the deficit, including politically
distasteful proposals like raising taxes or cutting cost-of-living
increases in Social Security.
   And they agreed that Bush should not invite conflict by seeking
immediate renewal of military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,
but should seek a consensus policy that relies more heavily on
diplomacy.
   Under the Senate rules, the 55 Democrats will choose among the
three in a closed meeting by secret ballot. If no one wins on the
first ballot, the candidate with the least votes drops out and the
choice then is between the two survivors.
   None of the three is claiming a majority, but each claims to have
commitments for more than enough votes to make it past the first
round.
   It's something of a tradition in Congress for lawmakers to
mislead their colleagues and even the press as to their true
intentions in the secret elections. When Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., was embarrassed by Byrd and defeated for the assistant
majority leader post in 1971, reporters and Kennedy himself had
counted the votes in his favor.
   The assistant majority leader's post also is being contested this
year, in a face off that pits Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., against
incumbent Alan Cranston, D-Calif.

   The release of two elderly
black leaders capped a week of government moves that earned
international praise. But domestic critics said Sunday the goodwill
gestures must be followed with a dismantling of apartheid.
   The government, citing ``medical-humanitarian reasons,'' on
Saturday freed two seriously ill leaders, Harry Gwala, 69, a
longtime member of the African National Congress, and Zephania
Mothopeng, 75, president of the Pan Africanist Congress. Both
anti-apartheid groups are outlawed.
   The men, both colleagues of jailed ANC leader Nelson Mandela,
served some 35 years in prison between them.
   ``It makes a pleasant change for South Africans to end a week
with the sweet sounds of praise ringing in their ears rather than
the harsh rasp of castigation,'' said The Sunday Star of
Johannesburg, an anti-apartheid newspaper.
   But the newspaper cautioned: ``Only if the intent to rid the
country of apartheid is clearly stated and acted upon will the
momemtum of the last week be sustained.''
   In addition to releasing the two prisoners, the government last
week:
   _ Announced that Mandela, the country's best known black leader,
will not return to prison when he completes his recovery from
tuberculosis at a Cape Town hospital. However, Mandela will remain
in custody at a ``suitable'' location, the government added.
   _ Granted clemency to the ``Sharpeville Six,'' a group of blacks
sentenced to death for complicity in a 1984 mob killing. The death
sentences, replaced with lengthy jail terms, had provoked
international protest.
   _ Endorsed a regional peace plan under which South Africa would
grant independence to South-West Africa, also known as Namibia.
   The actions won widespread praise from Western governments and
are likely to dampen foreign campaigns to place additional sanctions
against South Africa toward ending the system of racial segregation,
under which blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The City Press, South-Africa's largest-selling black-oriented
newspaper, said Sunday the moves ``bought President P.W. Botha more
time to maneuver.''
   But the paper also noted the extreme-right Conservative Party,
which controls dozens of town councils, decided last week to ban
blacks from using public facilities in the industrial town of
Boksburg. Additional towns controlled by the Conservatives have said
they plan to follow suit.
   ``What this means is that we are back to square one in race
relations,'' the City Press said in an editorial.
   The government has won been praised in recent years for releasing
aging anti-apartheid activists who have served lengthy prison
sentences.
   But an estimated 1,000 activists remain in detention without
charge under the government's 29-month-old state of emergency. The
government also has banned 23 leading anti-apartheid organizations
this year and has threatened additional crackdowns.
   The government faces several politically sensitive issues in the
near future.
   The President's Council, an advisory body to Botha, is scheduled
this week to debate a bill that would strengthen the Group Areas
Act, which segregates all neighborhoods by race.
   Also, the government is expected to call national elections early
next year and must contend with the increasingly powerful
Conservatives.
   Both the African National Congress and the Pan Africanist
Congress use armed resistance against the white-led government.
However, the Pan Africanist Congress favors black self-reliance in
the struggle for political rights, while the ANC supports a
multiracial approach.

   The election of George Bush and Dan Quayle may
mean that a bevy of rising GOP stars must hold their ambitions in
check into the next century.
   Democratic hopefuls already are organizing behind the scenes to
position themselves for the 1992 presidential election, and they
``don't have to be very bashful'' about it, said Thomas Mann, a
scholar at the Brookings Institution.
   ``Some of them can start running tomorrow,'' he said.
   But Republicans, out of deference to their party and the new man
in the Oval Office, must ``put their political ambitions on hold,''
said Richard A. Brody, a political scientist at Stanford University.
   Bush is likely to be the GOP nominee again in 1992 _ assuming he
wants the job and that his administration encounters no disaster _
and Quayle has a good shot at retaining the second slot on the
ticket if he performs well in office, several analysts said.
   ``The greatest likelihood is that Bush will stand for re-election
and everyone has got to tread water for eight years,'' Mann said.
``You don't normally challenge a sitting president.''
   Looking to 1996, Quayle has a built-in edge to succeed Bush,
pushing the presidential prospects of others into the next century,
the analysts said.
   ``They've got Dan Quayle sitting in the middle of the road
blocking the road to advancement,'' William Schneider, a
Washington-based political analyst, said of other GOP hopefuls. ``A
vice president usually has a leg up in getting the nomination.''
   Bob Dole, the Kansas senator unsuccessfully sought the Republican
presidential nomination in 1980 and 1988, has complained about
``this promotion idea that you just ought to go up the ladder'' from
vice president to president.
   The political clock may run out on Dole, who would turn 73 before
Election Day 1996.
   Younger Republicans thought to harbor presidential ambitions
include outgoing Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and former Delaware Gov.
Pete du Pont, both vanquished by Bush this time around; New Jersey
Gov. Thomas Kean; and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm.
   The political futures of the GOP hopefuls turn on whether they
assume prominent positions in the Bush administration or elsewhere,
what the ideological bent of the administration turns out to be, and
whether Bush and Quayle do well, said John Kessel, a political
scientist at Ohio State University.
   Kemp, who joins the Heritage Foundation in January when his House
term ends, is one whose presidential prospects could be especially
damaged by fellow conservative Quayle, Brody said.
   ``An increasingly positive position of Dan Quayle in the
Republican Party, particularly among conservatives, is going to come
out of Jack Kemp's hide,'' Brody said.
   Du Pont, from the same side of the party, could be discouraged
from making another run if it looks like either Kemp or Quayle were
the conservative favorite, Mann said.
   Gramm can use his post in Congress to ``fight the good fight''
and be a strong voice for Senate Republicans during the Bush years,
but he is another who can be hurt by Quayle, Schneider said.
   ``Quayle clearly blocks the way for conservative young
Republicans like Kemp and Gramm,'' he said.
   Prospects for Kean, a rising star in the party's moderate wing,
could be particularly affected by the administration's ideological
slant, Kessel said. Kean's term ends next year.
   If Bush's White House turns out to be strongly conservative, it
could ``leave a vacuum on the moderate side of the Republican Party,
either freezing them out for eight years, or conceivably someone
like Tom Kean might emerge,'' Kessel said.
   If the Bush administration does poorly, it could taint the whole
Republican party and hinder the election chances for any would-be
GOP successor, Kessel said.
   A poor showing by Bush could improve the prospects for another
Republican to move in and try a ``palace coup'' in 1992, said Mann.
   Challenges to the president from within his party are rare. The
most recent instances _ both unsuccessful _ were Ronald Reagan's
1976 challenge to Gerald Ford and Massachusetts Sen. Edward
Kennedy's confrontation with Jimmy Carter in 1980.
   The best bet is that ``if the Bush term is successful, no one
will challenge him,'' Mann said.

   All her life, Jama Hedgecoth has loved
animals. But she never quite expected it to come to this: She sells
housebroken, exotic pigs and runs an animal talent agency that
represents a variety of four-legged stars.
   On a 25-acre animal farm south of Atlanta, with the help of her
husband, Charlie, and four children, Mrs. Hedgecoth tends to some
300 creatures: dogs, cats, raccoons, foxes, deer, goats, chickens,
turkeys, ducks, geese, an ostrich, a miniature horse, one 300-pound
hog and a pack of pint-size pigs.
   She sells the petite porkers through Designer Pigs, one of her
business ventures. As for the rest of the menagerie, some are stars
represented by her other venture, The Animal Agency. Others are
family pets.
   ``When I was a kid, we traveled all over the world, because my
father is an evangelist, and we could never have animals like
this,'' Mrs. Hedgecoth said. ``When I got married 17 years ago, I
told my husband, `My dream is to live on a farm and have every
animal that's feasible to own.'''
   Five years ago, the Hedgecoths got their farm, along with dogs
and cats.
   In 1987, a friend asked her where he might find 15 cats for a cat
litter commercial. What the producers feared would be eight hours in
cat hell turned into a 30-minute lark _ she has a knack for animal
training _ and a business was born.
   Mrs. Hedgecoth and her partner, Bryan Hudson, began contacting
advertising agencies and anybody else who might need a well-behaved
animal now and then.
   In less than two years, The Animal Agency has worked on about 100
jobs, half of them still-photo modeling sessions and the other half
TV commercials, mostly for agencies in Atlanta.
   Her Benji-look-alike dog, Amber, starred in a Honda Accord spot.
Roy, a mammoth tom turkey, starred in a ham ad.
   For a Reebok spot, she brought along Hickory the goat, Scarlett
the black miniature pig and 81-year-old Griffin farmer James Roy
Goggans and his sneaker-wearing cow, Daisy, whose stage name is
Bessie.
   The Animal Agency also supplied animal actors for a TV movie
recently filmed in Georgia, ``Dying For Love.'' Mrs. Hedgecoth's
husband and father got bit parts.
   If she doesn't have a particular animal, she'll find it _ and
train it.
   ``If you call us and say you need a white goose that will walk on
a leash for a child, I'll tell you, `You give me three days,''' she
said.
   Clients are charged $100 an hour and up. ``What they pay for is
Bryan and me, our know-how in how to work with the animals,'' she
said.
   Last year, Mrs. Hedgecoth got into the pet pig business, with
rare, ugly-but-hip Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs that sell for $1,500.
She also breeds an uncommon line of miniature African pigs, two
inches taller but $1,200 cheaper.
   ``They're real special,'' she said. ``They love to car ride. ...
And when you buy a pig from me, the little pig's housebroken and
spoiled rotten.''

   Even Santa has become hip with the
times and has ditched the traditional sleigh this year in favor of a
gyrocopter.
   That's what Freddie Roberts says, anyway. Roberts recently
surprised residents of nearby Elkton, Ky., when he flew over the
town in his kit-built gyrocopter adorned with five plywood reindeer
and an aluminum sleigh.
   ``Actually, I'm not Santa Claus, I'm his mechanic,'' said
Roberts, dressed in a red Santa suit and crash helmet with white
beard attached.
   ``It's a shame that parents lie to their kids and say there's no
such thing as Santa Claus or flying sleighs and flying reindeer,''
Roberts said. ``Now the kids will be able to tell them otherwise.''
   Roberts attached the reindeer and sleigh, which doubles as a
rudder, to the helicopter-like craft despite warnings from the
manufacturer that it wouldn't fly. He crashed on his first two test
flights because of engine failure.
   Although he wasn't hurt, Roberts had to rebuild the copter.
   Now that he's mastered the Santa copter, Roberts said he will try
to perfect his Frisbee-like shoes that allow the wearer to walk on
water _ as long as the engines don't fail or run out of gas.

   An Arkansan who has been quacking
competitively for 14 years has captured the top title for duck
imitators, the World's Duck Calling Championship.
   Johnny Mahfouz of Stuttgart has been in duck-calling contests
since 1974. Last year, he finished fourth in the world championship,
which is staged in conjunction with the Wings Over The Prairie
Festival. On Saturday, he took the top prize in the 53rd annual
international competition.
   The contest began with 45 duck-callers, and 26 returned for a
second round. The field was trimmed to six finalists, whose mating,
feeding, comeback and hail calls were ranked by five judges.
   Mahfouz, 31, said he didn't make a strong start in the opening
round, ``but I managed to find the calls in the second and third
rounds _ thank goodness for that.''
   ``Heck, I'm sitting on Cloud 45, which is way above Cloud Nine,''
he said. For his efforts, Mahfouz received a trophy, adorned with an
oversized ornamental duck call; a $4,000 savings bond; an engraved
shotgun and case; a Labrador retriever puppy with a year's supply of
dog food; a hunting trip; and a trip to a professional baseball game.

   The familiar battle between abortion proponents
and the Catholic Church has taken an ironic twist in Hawaii, where
Planned Parenthood wants to perform abortions on church-owned land,
in the shadow of the diocese's cathedral.
   Hawaii Planned Parenthood had for years concentrated on
contraception and referred women to doctors for abortions elsewhere,
but in 1987 it applied for a state permit to perform abortions at
its downtown clinic, which it has leased since 1976.
   The clinic is in a building owned by 1164 Partners that stands on
land of which the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hawaii is primary owner.
The 12th floor clinic overlooks the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace.
   When the state granted permission for abortions at the clinic,
the Catholic Church, which regards abortion as murder, took Planned
Parenthood and the state to court.
   The church was joined in its fight by 1164 Partners.
   Their lawsuit claimed abortion is prohibited under both the
building's lease and the master lease written by the church, which
contain provisions against ``objectionable'' practices.
   ``The whole question of abortion is against our moral values,''
said Hawaii Bishop Joseph Ferrario.
   A federal judge earlier this month declined to issue a temporary
restraining order to keep Planned Parenthood from performing
abortions there, citing lack of jurisdiction. A state court earlier
refused to issue a temporary restraining order, although it has not
yet ruled on the original suit. Planned Parenthood has asked for an
expedited ruling, while the church wants a trial.
   Ferrario said state approval of the clinic's abortion permit
application was ``insensitive'' to the state's 220,000 Catholics, 20
percent of the total population and Hawaii's largest religious group.
   ``That clinic is a stone's throw away from our church, and to me
this is the grossest insensivity,'' he said. ``There was no public
hearing, no chance for the neighbors to voice their opposition. They
were already in there, and wanted to expand, so it was a purely
administrative process.''
   The proposed abortion clinic also is bad business for the
building's owners, said Paul Goto, one of the partnership's lawyers.
   He said the building's other tenants were harassed by the
anti-abortion group Hawaii Right to Life, which has sent tenants
letters asking: ``Do you want to ride in those elevators with the
brutally mangled bodies of unborn babies?''
   Protests, bomb threats and bad publicity have scared away
prospective tenants and forced at least one tenant out, Goto said.
   Cheryl Vasconcellos, executive director of Hawaii Planned
Parenthood, said the clinic will move when its lease expires in
1992, and that the costly legal battle now will lay the framework
for that move.
   ``The church may say it'll be all over once we move, but Right to
Life will oppose us wherever we try to go,'' she said. ``Moving
takes money, and that four years before the lease expires buys us
some time to earn that money and to apply for the permits we'll need
to open a new clinic. We can't just pick up and move right now.''
   Vasconcellos said it was ironic the church did not object to
Planned Parenthood's rental agreement before, even though the clinic
prescribes birth control pills and other contraceptives, which also
are outlawed by the church.
   Ferrario admitted the church was lax in ever allowing Planned
Parenthood to rent space in the building.
   ``But back then, there was a way of sort of living with Planned
Parenthood on the issue of contraception. It's not so easy to live
with abortion,'' he said.
   Vasconcellos said Planned Parenthood was free to perform
abortions pending the outcome of the lawsuit and would start doing
so by the end of November, declining to be more specific.
   Last year, there were 5,964 abortions in the state, or one for
every three births.
   ``The time has come for us to provide this obviously needed
service,'' Vasconcellos said. ``Reproductive rights are at stake.''

<HEAD>Syrians Finally Intervene to Stop Street Fighting</HEAD>

   Syrian peacekeeping troops intervened
Sunday to halt fighting by rival Shiite Moslem militias around the
Iranian Embassy on the fifth day of fierce street clashes around
Beirut.
   The Syrians set a 1 p.m. deadline for fighters of the pro-Syrian
Amal militia and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, to
withdraw from the streets in west and south Beirut.
   ``The Syrian army has orders to shoot on sight any gunman on the
streets in Beirut and the southern suburbs after the deadline,'' the
ultimatum said.
   Syrian officers, accompanied by soldiers armed with
shoulder-fired rocket launchers, blared the warning through
bullhorns in all embattled districts. It was also broadcast by
several Beirut radio stations.
   ``Apart from a few sniper shots, the fighting stopped in all
districts at the deadline set by the Syrians,'' said a police
spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules.
   But several hours later, heavy fighting resumed in two districts
adjoining the Beirut airport highway. A police spokesman said the
Syrian command called on representatives of the two militias to
quickly recall their fighters.
   It was the first serious effort by the 12,000-man Syrian
contingent to halt five days of fierce fighting that has left 35
people killed and 74 wounded by police count.
   The warning was issued after Amal and Hezbollah militiamen
battled around the six-story Iranian Embassy building in west Beirut.
   Police said the militias also fired machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades in the neighboring district of Bir Hassan,
following a tank and mortar bombardment in the city's southern slums
on Saturday night.
   In fierce fighting Friday and Saturday, militiamen forced
Hezbollah fighters to leave eight of 11 embattled west Beirut
neighborhoods.
   Police said the Syrians were negotiating arrangements to evacuate
Hezbollah fighters from five beleagered buildings in three other
districts.
   The Syrians set up checkpoints on key intersections in the three
neighborhoods, apparently to prevent an attack on Hezbollah's
hideouts. Amal gunmen were seen lurking in nearby alleys.
   Amal's victory has dealt a harsh blow to Hezbollah's bid for
dominance of the 1 million Shiites who form the largest single sect
among Lebanon's four million inhabitants.
   The Syrians have been concerned over Hezbollah's growing military
clout, believing their role as Lebanon's main power broker might be
challenged.
   Hezbollah's fighters drove Amal out of strongholds in the slums
during May in a three-week campaign that left nearly 300 people
killed and 1,000 wounded.
   ``We've now evened the score,'' said an Amal official, who
demanded anonymity.
   Thousands of residents trapped indoors during the fighting
ventured out after the Syrian intervention to assess property losses.
   Parked cars were riddled with bullet-holes. Severed cables
dangled from broken power poles and dirty water gushed from
punctured sewer lines. Streets were thick with glass shards and
spent cartridges.
   ``What have we done to deserve all this?'' said Mahmoud Itter as
he surveyed the ruins of his electrical tool shop in the district of
lower Basta.
   Slum residents took advantage of the lull in the fighting to bury
their dead. Reporters counted at least eight funeral processions and
saw mourners frequently duck as sniper fire cracked overhead.
   An unsigned letter to the militia combatants published by
Beirut's leftist daily As-Safir voiced outrage at the fighting.
   ``Have you forgotten the women, children and elderly living in
the neighborhoods where you are fighting?'' the letter said.
   ``Why don't you go to garbage dumps outside the city and fight it
out there until you are all killed? We will then bury you in the
garbage because the soil of Lebanon should not be contaminated by
your filthy bodies.''

<TEXT>
   More than $115,000 has been handed out to House
Democrats by Rep. William Gray, a Pennsylvania lawmaker who is
looking for votes in a three-way race for a relatively obscure
leadership post.
   According to Federal Election Commission records, campaign
contributions of more than $123,000 have been made to lawmakers who
will vote Dec. 5 in the secret-ballot election for House caucus
chairman, the chamber's No. 3 leadership position.
   Nearly all the giving was done by Gray, who is seeking the caucus
chair after serving as House Budget Committee chairman for the
maximum four years allowed by House rules.
   Through his regular campaign treasury and a year-old political
action committee, Gray has given at least $115,450 this year to 84
returning House Democrats and 32 people who sought House seats in
the last election. Fifteen of the 32 won and will participate in the
caucus election.
   Gray's 1988 giving, which outstripped all of his contributions to
colleagues' campaigns the previous five years, was detailed in FEC
reports through Oct. 19. The total will rise.
   Jon Plebani, chief of staff of Gray's congressional office, says
that more contributions were made after Oct. 19. ``I don't know the
amounts,'' he said. That giving will be covered in reports due at
the FEC three days after the caucus election.
   One of Gray's opponents, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, the Ohio Democrat
who is now vice chair of the caucus, also has given to colleagues _
$7,731, which she says was distributed early this year after
Democratic leaders appealed for help for incumbents facing tough
re-election battles.
   The third caucus chair candidate, Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., has
not followed suit. He declines to comment on the money being spent
by his opponents, but Ms. Oakar is not happy about Gray's spending.
   ``It's difficult to compete at any time against money,'' she said
in an interview, echoing the complaint often voiced by candidates
trying to get elected to the House against well-heeled incumbents.
   ``I feel I'm running on the basis of merit, not contributions,''
said Ms. Oakar, who claims to have commitments from 129 of the 264
Democrats in the party caucus.
   Plebani, who responded to an Associated Press request for an
interview with Gray, declined to discuss their vote count, but he
said of Oakar's claim: ``If she has 129 votes, there are at least
700 members of the Democratic caucus.''
   The three representatives are running for one of the true insider
jobs in the House. Caucus meetings, which set policy positions for
House Democrats, are closed to the public. The chair gets no extra
pay, but four staff positions go with the job.
   Almost 80 percent of the money given out by Gray this year came
from the Committee for Democratic Opportunity, the political action
committee he formed last December and which had raised $134,524
through Oct. 19.
   His leadership PAC is not unusual on Capitol Hill. More than 70
members of Congress have them, all with the ostensible purpose of
helping build party ranks in the Senate and House.
   But in a fund-raising appeal last May, Gray linked his PAC with
his caucus chair candidacy. House members and veteran staffers said
this was the first time a leadership PAC had been openly tied to a
leadership campaign.
   ``The PAC was obviously set up for the caucus chair race,'' Ms.
Oakar said.
   Speaking for Gray, Plebani said: ``He's running on his record of
proven leadership and effective coalition building. Those
contributions were given without regard to the recipient's
preference for caucus chair. Contributions were given to public
supporters of Mr. Synar and Ms. Oakar. The bulk of the contributions
were given in the most toughly contested races in the country.''
   Nine House members who have publicly endorsed Oakar were among
the 84 incumbents who shared $84,200 in Gray contributions through
Oct. 19. While the average overall contribution was about $1,000,
the known Oakar supporters averaged $561 each.
   FEC records show that Gray's largest contributions this year went
to colleagues involved in tough races: $6,000 to Louise Slaughter,
D-N.Y.; $5,500 to Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., and $5,000 to James
Clarke, D-N.C.
   Gray also gave money to local candidates in Pennsylvania and to
House colleagues who unsuccessfully sought Senate seats: $5,000 to
Mike Lowry in Washington and $2,000 each to Buddy MacKay in Florida
and Wayne Dowdy in Mississippi.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
Party may offer the post of finance minister to Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres as an inducement to join a coalition government, a
Shamir aide said Sunday.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a top adviser to Shamir, said Likud Cabinet
ministers discussed the proposal Sunday but made no final decision
about whether to go ahead with the offer.
   ``We are only at the start of the discussion,'' Ahimeir said. ``A
way must be found to bring about talks for a broad and stable
government.''
   But Likud leaders are divided over the proposal, Ahimeir said,
with many objecting to offering Peres the nation's top economic post.
   Ahimeir said the proposal may win the approval of Likud Cabinet
ministers at a second meeting on Monday, and that if it did, Shamir
would discuss it formally with Peres.
   If a meeting is held between Shamir and Peres, it could set the
stage for formation of a broad-based national unity government like
the one that has ruled Israel since the 1984 national elections
ended in stalemate.
   As part of the new proposal, which emerged after secret weekend
contacts between Likud and left-leaning Labor, Likud's Moshe Arens,
a former ambassador to Washington, would replace Peres as foreign
minister, four Israeli daily newspapers reported Sunday.
   The Hadashot and Yediot Ahronot dailies said Yitzhak Rabin of
Labor would remain defense minister and Ariel Sharon of Likud would
keep the post of industry minister.
   Four other Cabinet posts would also be earmarked for Labor,
appearing to meet the party's key condition for parity in the
distribution of government posts, the newspapers said.
   Peres made no public comment about the reported proposal.
   Uzi Bar-Am, secretary-general of the party, said Peres would have
a hard time getting approval from the policy-making Central
Committee to join a Likud-led Cabinet.
   In the Nov. 1 national elections, Shamir's Likud edged out Labor,
winning 40 seats to 39 in the 120-seat Parliament while small
religious and right-wing parties made gains. President Chaim Herzog
chose Shamir to assemble a ruling coalition and recommended he try
to include Labor.
   Such a coalition would substantially limit the bargaining power
of the small religious and right-wing parties.
   The religious parties offer to join a coalition in exchange for
demands that have aroused the ire of Israel's secular majority and
of Jews abroad. One demand is for legislation giving Orthodox rabbis
the power to define who is a Jew, a move seen as an affront to
rabbis of Judaism's Reform and Conservative branches.
   Extreme right-wing factions want to annex the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip and to expand Jewish settlements in the areas.

   Residents can buy a $7.50 license
to join a gold rush in northern Malaysia, the national news agency
Bernama reported Sunday.
   The agency said the government declared licensed diggers can pan
for gold in an area in the state of Trengganu, which attracted
thousands of fortune seekers after gold ore was found in a stream a
few weeks ago.
   On Sunday, about 4,000 people without licenses were illegally
sifting their way through the area's waters, the news agency said.
   The nominal license fee is $7.50 and a monthly license costs
$11.26.
   But permits are restricted to residents of Trengganu and they
must be at least 18 years old, Bernama said.
   Anyone searching for gold illegally may end up empty-handed _ and
have to pay a fine of up to $375, it said.

   Gary Hart, the former Colorado senator and
Democratic presidential candidate, is playing a quiet game in the
big-stakes global marketplace, helping develop foreign trade and
investments.
   Hart, who works for the prestigious Denver law firm of Davis,
Graham & Stubbs, spends much of his time these days with ``a very
large Taiwanese client.'' The client, he says, is a group of 27
companies ``with assets in the billions'' that is looking at large
investments in the United States.
   Hart, who turns 52 Monday, has been spending about half of his
time on the road. ``It's a combination of law firm business but
primarily as a guest of various kinds of hosts,'' he said in an
interview with the Denver Post. He has just returned from Japan and
Taiwan, following trips to Italy and Iraq.
   He is going to London in December to analyze the U.S. elections
for the Sunday Times, the to Paris to give a foreign policy speech
and meet with former French president Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   He still bristles at persistent references in the news media to
his relationship with model Donna Rice _ the flaw in judgment that
eventually killed his presidential hopes.
   But he adds: ``I'm not a complainer. If I resented everything
that I have a right to resent, I'd do nothing but resent.''

   It was Olympia Dukakis who won the Oscar
for ``Moonstruck,'' but the award also has changed the career of her
fellow actor and husband of 27 years, Louis Zorich.
   Ms. Dukakis, who was considered too ``ethnic'' for major roles,
now finds herself in demand for film work. And Zorich, who said he
``did a lot of stuff, very frankly, that wasn't very good, but I had
to make money,'' can afford to be picky in what he does.
   ``Because of what has happened with Olympia and the money she's
making, I don't have to go out and do things (such as commercials)
that I don't want to do,'' Zorich said. ``If I find a play I would
love to do and fit into the schedule, I can do it.''
   The couple, who helped found the Whole Theatre in Montclair, are
making a rare joint appearance in its season-opener, ``Better
Living.''
   ``For us to work together we both have to really want to do the
parts, and secondary is us working together,'' said Ms. Dukakis,
whose cousin Michael is governor of Massachusetts.

   A sinister-looking armored car
custom-built for actor Sylvester Stallone with bulletproof glass, a
navigation computer and a public address system has been auctioned
for $68,250.
   ``It's just like you'd think a car to protect Sylvester Stallone
would look. It's all black with blackened windows _ very scary
looking,'' said Chris Main, spokeswoman for the annual Rick Cole
Auction.
   Stallone's car, a jet-black 1987 Chevrolet Suburban, was among
460 vehicles put on the auction block at the annual two-day sale of
vintage and custom automobiles.
   Ms. Main did not know why Stallone, the tough guy star of a
series of ``Rocky'' and ``Rambo'' action films, decided to sell it.
   The high bidder for the armored vehicle Saturday was Marvin
Friedman, of Autoputer, a Miami company dealing in collectible cars.
He plans to use it for promotions, said Ms. Main.

<HEAD>Civilians Distribute Leaflets Calling For A Military Coup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIGUEL C. SUAREZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops and police went on alert Sunday
after authorities blocked bus convoys carrying thousands of
civilians into Manila to distribute leaflets calling for a coup,
officials said.
   The leaflets distributed Saturday called for the military
overthrow of President Corazon Aquino's government, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The armed forces of the Philippines is now taking over the
government,'' the Manila newspaper Malaya quoted one of the leaflets
as saying. ``We will replace unpatriotic government officials who
are only interested in building political parties.''
   Police in the Manila suburb of Las Pinas said they detained about
20 people who were spreading the leaflets, but all but five were
released.
   More than 1,000 other people were blocked by police when they
arrived in Las Pinas in a convoy of buses and jeeps from the nearby
province of Cavite.
   In Manila's Sampaloc district, Col. Leonardo Orig of the
Philippine Constabulary said police intercepted 12 buses and four
jeeps carrying about 500 people, some of whom were handing out
pro-coup leaflets. The group came from the northern provinces of
Tarlac, Pampanga and La Union.
   Similar movements were reported in other areas, including the
capital's financial district of Makati, where police rounded up more
than 100 people. All were released after a few hours of questioning.
   ``Everything is normal now and we may lift the alert tonight or
tomorrow,'' said Orig, who said the demonstrators had been paid.
   Officials who asked not to be identified said they were told by
investigators that right-wing extremists were using the convoys as a
way of ``testing the waters'' for mounting a possible coup attempt.
   Authorities have foiled a half dozen coup attempts against Mrs.
Aquino, who came to power after a civilian-military uprising in
February 1986 that ousted President Ferdinand Marcos.
   In another development, forensic experts were trying to determine
if skeletons exhumed in central Luzon were those of two women
allegedly slain in a military cover-up of the 1983 killing of Mrs.
Aquino's husband.
   The remains, exhumed Saturday, were being tested in Manila to
determine if they are those of two sisters who knew the man
initially thought to have killed former Sen. Benigno Aquino,
according to officials of the National Bureau of Investigation.
   Aquino was shot to death on Aug. 21, 1983, at the Manila
International Airport as soldiers escorted him out of a plane when
he arrived home from three years of self-imposed exile in the United
States.
   Marcos and the military claimed Aquino was slain by Rolando
Galman, an alleged communist agent killed by soldiers immediately
after Aquino was shot.
   But a civilian board investigating the slaying concluded Aquino
was killed by one of his military escorts and Galman was a
scapegoat. Investigators described Galman as an underworld figure
with links to military officials.
   The bodies, suspected to be those of two hostesses at a bar
frequented by Galman, were exhumed from a field just outside Capas,
60 miles north of Manila. The grave was identified by five
militiamen who claimed military officers ordered them to bury the
women in December 1983.
   The Philippine Daily Inquirer and the Philippine Daily Globe
reported Sunday that the orders came from officers linked to Eduardo
Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's first cousin and a close associate of
Marcos.
   Cojuangco fled the country in 1986 and lives in California. Mrs.
Aquino has banned him from returning.
   The sisters, Anna and Catherine Oliva, disappeared in September
1983.
   Gen. Fabian Ver, then the military chief of staff, and 25 others
were acquitted of killing Benigno Aquino in December 1985.
   But a new Supreme Court constituted after Mrs. Aquino came to
power ruled the first trial was manipulated by Marcos and ordered a
new trial. The number of defendants has increased to 40, most of
them soldiers.

<TEXT>
   A group of activists has called for
sweeping reforms that would allow citizens to join opposition
political parties, elect government officials and modify the
constitution through referendums.
   The proposals are contained in a program adopted by the
Independent Smallholders Party, which was revived earlier this month
after more than 30 years of inactivity. The independent organization
is the first of dozens that have been formed over the past year to
declare itself a political party.
   Legislation is to be adopted next month to regulate the
establishment of independent associations, but separate laws
allowing the establishment of political parties are not expected to
be adopted before 1990.
   The Communist-led government says opposition political parties
may be allowed to evolve, but not before 1990. As it stands now, the
Communist Party appoints all government officials and modifies the
constitution when it chooses. Parliament acts as a rubber stamp.
   Karoly Ravasz, spokesman for the Smallholders Party, said
sweeping political reforms must be enacted before 1990. ``(We) think
society won't wait two years,'' he told Western journalists in
Budapest after the Smallholders adopted a new platform at a meeting
this weekend.
   The government plans a broad program of political reforms that
Minister of State Imre Pozsgay calls a ``plan for democracy'' to
coincide with economic reforms that include strict austerity
measures.
   Leaders in the provisional Presidium say the Smallholders Party,
which headed a coalition government after World War II, was never
formally disbanded after the communists assumed power in 1948 and a
one-party state was established. But the Smallholders say they were
forced to suspend activities.
   The party was briefly represented in the government of Imre Nagy
in 1956 before Soviet troops and tanks crushed an anti-communist
uprising.
   The revived Smallholders Party's 46-point program includes
several demands similar to reforms Pozsgay suggested to parliament
at a session last week.
   Ravasz said the Smallholders called for free elections,
referendums to modify the constitition, ``full and unconditional
rights'' of freedom, thought, religion, speech, assembly and
association, and an independent media.
   Pozsgay says legislation being drafted would deal with many of
these issues. The official media, which have become increasingly
open in recent months, have not directly reported on the revival of
the Smallholders Party.
   Pozsgay told reporters last week that no repressive measures
would be taken against the Smallholders, but until legislation
regulating the founding of parties is passed the government will not
provide publicity for it.

   A 17-year-old escapee from a state youth
detention center was held Saturday on charges of stealing a car
containing a sickly 4-month-old boy whom authorities later found
next to a trash bin.
   Authorities said Jeffery Charles Jefferies of Gaffney was
arrested early Saturday and charged with kidnapping and grand
larceny, Lexington County Sheriff James Metts said.
   The child, Matthew David Caldwell, who is on a heart monitor and
requires medication every 12 hours, was taken to a hospital, found
to be in good health, and released to his family, authorities said.
   Around 8 p.m. Friday, Roland Caldwell, 28, stopped his car in
Columbia to make a phone call. He left his car running to warm his
infant son, authorities said.
   Caldwell told authorities he saw a young man jump into his car
and drive away. The father ran after the car and held on for about a
quarter-mile before being thrown off, authorities said.
   Metts said with the help of informants, Jefferies was traced to a
nightspot in Gaffney, 50 miles north of Columbia, and arrested. He
said Jeffries told authorities he left the baby with a woman at a
convenience store.
   A state highway patrol trooper found the child by a trash bin at
a convenience store on S.C. Highway 34, Metts said.
   Jeffries was being held at John G. Richards Facility in Columbia,
a detention center run by the state Department of Youth Services.
Officials said they were re-evaluating security needs.
   If tried and convicted as an adult, Jeffries could be sentenced
to life in prison for kidnapping and 10 years for grand larcency.

   About 85 animal welfare activists demonstrated
Saturday against a bow-and-arrow deer season, condemning as inhumane
the hunt by handicapped people in a mostly fenced-in Navy yard.
   Only people in wheelchairs are eligible for the hunt, which
started Wednesday and could last until Dec. 11 at the Navy's
Manchester Fuel Depot near Bremerton, west of Seattle across the
Puget Sound. Two deer were killed Saturday.
   The Navy said the deer have overpopulated the 234-acre enclosure
and many have died in recent years of starvation.
   The activists walked in front of the main gate at Sandpoint Naval
Station in Seattle carrying signs reading, ``Deer Today, Gone
Tomorrow,'' ``Bambi Watch Out,'' ``How Deer You,'' ``U.S. Navy Hold
Your Fire,'' ``Stop The Deer Slaughter,'' and ``Bow Hunting Tame
Deer Inhumane.''
   One demonstrator was dressed in a deer costume pierced with a
number of arrows, while another protester dressed in a Navy uniform
and carried a bow and arrows.
   Mitchell Fox of the Progressive Animal Welfare Society, which
organized the demonstration, said the deer were easy targets as they
were well acclimated to people. Officials estimate 40 to 45 deer
live inside the enclosed area.
   Fox called the demonstration a last resort to stop the hunt,
following a federal judge's decision to clear the way for the
bow-and-arrow season.
   The state has recommended the hunt to promote a healthier herd.
   Fox said demonstrators want the Navy to appoint an arbitrator to
settle the dispute.
   A local Navy spokesman, Ed Edwards, said about a dozen hunters
had qualified at the Navy's archery range. There were four hunters
in wheelchairs out Saturday and two were successful, taking a doe
and a buck, he said. No hunting was scheduled for Sunday. He added
that the hunting will stop before Dec. 11 if eight deer are taken.

   Arson is suspected in a fire Saturday that
killed a woman, two of her sons and a young man visiting them,
authorities said.
   Another victim was in critical condition Saturday night at the
Hennepin County Medical Center. Six people in the lower part of the
duplex escaped unharmed.
   The fire is being investigated as a possible multiple homicide by
police and fire officials, said police Sgt. Michael LaVine. He would
not say if police had a suspect, or provide details of why arson was
suspected.
   Friends from the working class neighborhood said the woman had
three other children who were not home during the fire.
   ``They were a very good family. They never caused no trouble,''
said Janet Erickson, who described the dead woman as ``like a
sister.''
   A homicide division news release on the fatal blaze also
mentioned a fire reported about an hour and 20 minutes later at a
house a few blocks from the duplex. After extinguishing that blaze,
the statement said, firefighters saw that a fire had been
extinguished in a car in front of a nearby home.
   LaVine said he could not say whether authorities believe the
three fires are related.
   The fatal blaze was reported at 4:34 a.m. to police, LaVine said.
It was brought under control by 5:23 a.m. by up to 45 firefighters
from six departments.
   The Hennepin County medical examiner's office said Carol Ann
Kugel, 41; her sons, Don Smith, 22, and Wayne Kugel, 10; and James
Jackson, 21, all died of smoke inhalation.
   Jackson's twin brother, Joseph, who also was visiting, was in
critical condition.

<TEXT>
   Afghanistan guerrillas met with Soviet
officials Sunday to discuss an exchange of prisoners of war, said a
guerrilla source, Afghan radio and the Soviet news agency Tass.
   No further details were available on the talks in Islamabad. A
similar meeting was held earlier this year in Bonn, West Germany.
   Representatives of other rebel groups that belong to a loose and
often fractured guerrilla alliance denied talks were held Sunday.
The Soviet ambassador in Islamabad, Vladimir Vakunin, refused to
comment on the reports.
   The meeting was first reported by Afghanistan's official Radio
Kabul, which said the talks were held with Afghan ``opposition,'' a
reference to the Moslem insurgents. The meeting was confirmed by an
official with the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla group in Peshawar, who
spoke by telephone on condition of anonymity.
   Tass said the meeting ``between representatives of the Soviet
Embassy in Pakistan and the Afghan armed opposition forces''
discussed the return of Soviet prisoners.
   Hamid Gailani, spokesman for the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan guerrilla group said: ``There has been no such
contact.'' He said Afghan officials ``have been lying for the past
10 years so why not about this, too?''
   A denial also came from the Afghan news agency, a rebel
information center operated by members of the Hezb-e-Islami
guerrilla group.
   Earlier this year, Hezb-e-Islami representatives met Soviet
officials in Bonn to discuss a prisoner-exchange program.
   The two sides agreed to exchange one Soviet soldier for 25
rebels. However, the rebels abandoned the prisoner exchange after
the United Nations negotiated an accord on April 15 in Geneva that
calls for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops. Rebels say no
prisoners were ever exchanged.
   Also Sunday, Moslem guerrillas said they regained control of a
strategic border post after a week of fighting along a highway that
serves as their supply route from Pakistan.
   There was no independent confirmation of the guerrilla claim.
   In the latest round of battles that ended Saturday, the
U.S.-supported insurgents raided several Afghan government posts
along the road linking Pakistan with the eastern Afghan city of
Jalalabad, said Fazle Akbar, director of the pro-rebel Afghan
Information and Documentation Center.
   He said the rebels gained control of the border post at Torkham
as well as a 20-mile stretch of road, Akbar said.
   The battle for control of the highway and its military posts
began Nov. 2, when Moslem insurgents claimed victory at Torkham and
said they would keep the road closed until the city of Jalalabad was
in their control.
   Within two weeks, Soviet troops were flown to Jalalabad from
Kabul and made a sweep of the highway, recapturing Torkham, Western
and rebel sources said.
   In the latest battle for Torkham last week, about 200 Afghan
soldiers defected or surrendered, said Wasil Noor, spokesman for the
seven-party Afghan Guerrilla Alliance headquartered in Pakistan's
border city of Peshawar.
   Akbar said two Soviet-made surface-to-surface missiles hit the
Torkham area Saturday. There were no immediate reports of damage or
casualties.
   The Soviet Union, which earlier this month sent more missiles and
MiG fighter jets into Afghanistan, have claimed that stepped-up
attacks by guerrillas made it necessary to upgrade Kabul's arsenal.
   The Soviets, who intervened in Afghanistan in 1979 in support of
the government in Kabul, agreed to withdraw an estimated 100,000
troops in accordance with the U.N.-negotiated agreement.
   Half the Soviets troops left in August and the remaining soldiers
were to be pulled out by Feb. 15.
   The Soviets recently suspended the troop withdrawal, although
they have promised to meet the February deadline. The Soviets have
repeatedly charged that Pakistan and the United States continue to
arm the insurgents.
   Pakistan and Afghanistan pledged to refrain from intervention in
each other's internal affairs when they signed the Geneva accord.
The United States and the Soviet Union signed the accord as
guarantors.

   Four gunmen apparently angered because
they couldn't find any wealthy drug dealers to rob opened fire on a
group of restaurant patrons, wounding six people, police said Sunday.
   One man was in critical condition Sunday with a shotgun wound in
his chest but the other injuries were described as minor.
   Detective Sgt. Dennis O'Rourke said there have been similar
incidents around Palm Beach County in recent months.
   ``They're targeting drug dealers,'' he said. ``But this isn't a
drug-related shooting _ these people are truly victims from
everything we know up to this point. I think in this case these
people were out there innocently, and they got hit.''
   O'Rourke said the gunmen emerged from a car late Saturday and
forced a group of people in the restaurant parking lot to lie down
on the ground.
   Witnesses said the gunmen searched the people and then _
apparently angered at not finding anything worth taking _ opened
fire with a sawed-off shotgun, a machine gun and a semi-automatic
weapon.
   Three people inside the restaurant when the shooting began rushed
to the doorway and were hit by pellets from the shotgun, O'Rourke
said.
   ``It appears like these are just some opportunists who aren't
from here, and hear that if they come to town and go to
such-and-such a spot, they can rip off local drug dealers,''
O'Rourke said.
   A switchboard operator at St. Mary's Hospital in nearby Palm
Beach said Sunday that one man remained in critical condition after
being shot in the chest at point-blank range with the shotgun.
   The operator said another victim was released after treatment at
the hospital's emergency ward. The hospital had no record of the
other four and O'Rourke said their injuries were slight.

<HEAD>Atty Gen Releases Report In Case Of Five Babies' Skeletal Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoping new leads may surface, the state
attorney general has released an investigative report into the
unsolved mystery of five babies' skeletons that were decades old
when found in a trunk five years ago.
   The report quotes the woman who gave the trunk to neighbors as
saying the person who was responsible for the bodies was no longer
alive. But the woman's former co-workers said she often appeared
pregnant though she never had children.
   The skeletons were wrapped in newspapers dating between 1949 and
1952. Also in the trunk was a piece of metal that could have been an
abortion tool. They were discovered in 1983 when a Somersworth
couple, who said they'd kept the trunk for the woman for about 20
years, decided to get rid of it and opened it.
   Pathologists determined the skeletons were about 30 years old and
were those of newborn or not quite full-term infants. A cause of
death never was determined and no one was arrested.
   Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Howard said his office released
the report in hopes that someone with information about the case
would come forward.
   The investigative report, detailed in the New Hampshire Sunday
News, focuses on Shirley Elizabeth Fenerty Thomas, 68, who gave the
trunk to the Somersworth couple.
   ``I don't have any comment for you at all,'' Thomas, now living
in Lawrence, Mass., told the newspaper.
   Ronald Perron, then Somersworth police chief, said he told Thomas
a pathologist believed the remains were ``the results of a
`baby-snuffing' operation.''
   ``Mrs. Thomas then replied, `That's exactly what it was, but the
person responsible isn't alive anymore.'''
   The report includes a letter from Alaric Faulkner, an
anthropology professor at the University of Maine at Orono. He
identified a 12{-inch steel rod found in the trunk as a section of a
car radio antenna, flattened at one end.
   He said he inferred that the antenna was modified to make it into
a tool, a specific tool that ``simply wasn't readily come by and
this was a deliberate effort to make do.''
   ``In this sense I have found no evidence to disprove the
`abortion tool' hypothesis.''
   The report says Thomas married in the late 1930s but was divorced
shortly after World War II. In 1948 she began working at the General
Electric Co. plant in Somersworth.
   Patrick Boyle, a Somersworth police lieutenant during the 1983
investigation, interviewed Thomas' supervisor, Walter Osgood, and
several co-workers.
   Osgood ``can definitely recall Shirley Thomas being pregnant on
two separate occasions,'' Boyle wrote. Osgood said Thomas told him
at the time she had water tumors.
   ``The reason he questioned her was that she would appear
pregnant, leave on a Friday and would be back on a Monday ... and
there was no appearance of being pregnant,'' Boyle wrote.
   ``He became suspicious after the second occurrence and requested
that she have a company physical before returning to work. She
refused to take the physical and it was shortly thereafter that she
left G.E.,'' in 1953, Boyle wrote.
   The report said at least three co-workers recalled Thomas
frequently appearing to be pregnant.
   ``There was a lot of talk among the women at G.E., that they
would wonder what had happened to the children that Shirley was
giving birth to because she would never have any children,'' Boyle
wrote.
   According to the report, one co-worker, Helen Parcell of Dover,
said, ``Shirley was continually pregnant.''
   Parcell, the report said, ``stated she remembers another woman
being upset at the time because the policy at G.E. was that you
couldn't work beyond six months of pregnancy, and it was obvious
Shirley was going full-term and would only be out a couple of days
or less than two weeks.''
   Gregory Swope, who was an assistant attorney general during the
investigation, said the evidence, much of it based on rumor and
hearsay, was insufficient to prosecute anyone.

<HEAD>Bush Surrounds Himself With Old Friends, Loyalists</HEAD>

   George Bush's top advisers are mostly
longtime friends and loyalists whom he trusted for strategy during
his campaign and to whom he now turns for advice as president-elect.
   But on Monday, Bush will have to reach beyond this inner circle
to try to forge a working relationship with a former political
rival, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas.
   The meeting could be an early test of Bush's ability to work with
those outside his core of associates in dealing with Congress.
   The two are to meet for lunch in Bush's vice presidential office
in Executive Office Building next to the White House. Bush was
returning to Washington on Sunday after spending a four-day
Thanksgiving vacation here _ without meeting with any advisers.
   There is one new face in Bush's inner circle _ New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu, who will be White House chief-of staff. Otherwise,
Bush's closest associates are for the most part those who advised
him during the campaign, including James A. Baker III, Nicholas
Brady, Lee Atwater, Robert Teeter and Robert Mosbacher.
   Some members of Bush's inner circle have already been rewarded
for their loyalty with Cabinet posts, including Baker who will be
secretary of state.
   Bush prides himself on the loyalty he showed as vice president
for eight years to President Reagan, and he clearly values the trait
in others.
   Baker, 58, is one of Bush's best friends. The friendship goes
back more than two decades to when they forged a social and
political alliance in Houston _ Baker, a lawyer, and Bush, then an
oil man.
   When Baker was grieving over the death of his first wife, Bush
talked then-Democrat Baker into becoming active in Republican
politics. Baker switched parties, managed Bush's 1970 Senate race
and his 1980 and 1988 presidential bids.
   Baker, it has been widely reported, could have had any job in a
Bush administration he wanted; he picked State and Bush announced it
the day after the election.
   Another longtime Bush friend already holding a Cabinet post is
Treasury Secretary Brady _ whom Reagan chose last August to fill the
vacancy created when Baker resigned to oversee Bush's general
election campaign.
   Bush, who had a role in Reagan's choice, is keeping Brady, 58, in
that post in his own Cabinet.
   A New York investment banker, the wealthy Republican also
represented New Jersey in the Senate from 1980-82, filling the term
of Democratic Sen. Harrison Williams, convicted in the Abscam
bribery and conspiracy scandal.
   Sununu, 49, was not a member of Bush's inner circle previously,
but was an early and tireless campaign volunteer.
   Bush is known to credit Sununu at least in part for his comeback
victory in last winter's New Hampshire primary _ which, coming after
Bush's defeat in Iowa, put him squarely on the victory trail.
   Sununu became one of the most active of Bush's surrogate
speakers. His job as governor of a neighboring state gave him a
convenient platform from which to blast Gov. Michael Dukakis's
management of Massachusetts _ which the outspoken Sununu did at
every opportunity. Dukakis was the Democrat's presidential nominee.
   Teeter, 49, a Republican pollster who worked full-time in Bush's
campaign and is currently co-director of the Bush transition team,
is another Bush confidant.
   Sununu has offered him the job of deputy staff director. However,
amid reports that he had hoped for something more prestigious,
Teeter has indicated he wants more time to decide whether to accept
the offer or return to the private sector.
   Atwater, 37, the brash and innovative political operative who was
Bush's campaign manager, is another close adviser with whom the
president-elect consults frequently. Bush has named Atwater, who got
his start working for Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., as chairman of
the Republican National Committee.
   Although Atwater's combative approach, and sometimes unorthodox
tactics sometimes troubled other more-cautious Bush advisers, the
vice president is known to be fond of him and to seek out his
counsel.
   Mosbacher is another old friend of the vice president's from his
Texas oil days. Bush transition sources say he has the inside track
on being named Commerce secretary.
   He was finance director for Bush's campaign, and frequently
attended strategy sessions.
   Craig Fuller, 37, Bush's current chief-of-staff who shares with
Teeter the job of running the transition team, had been a member of
the inner circle but has moved to its fringe with Bush's selection
of Sununu to be his presidential chief of staff _ a job Fuller had
wanted. Fuller is a Californian who started out in the public
relations business before entering politics.

<HEAD>DEA Admits It Supervised Fake Drug Seizures, Planted News Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration admits it
has directed local law enforcement agencies nationwide to stage
phony drug seizures and generate false news reports about them to
help DEA agents gain the confidence of drug lords.
   DEA spokesman Maurice Hill in Washington, D.C., said the
technique is employed in high drug traffic areas across the country,
including Florida and Texas, the Houston Chronicle reported Sunday.
   ``It's a procedure that is used, but I can't begin to tell you
with what frequency,'' Hill told the newspaper. ``It's not a new
technique, I can tell you that.''
   Staging bogus seizures and feeding the information to reporters
apparently came into practice several years ago to resolve a problem
for undercover drug agents posing as cocaine importers for Colombian
drug lords, according to the Chronicle.
   Often the DEA operatives, posing as middlemen, deliver the drugs
to local dealers according to instructions from Colombian exporters.
They then keep the shipment under surveillance in the hope of
intercepting it before it hits the streets, officials said.
   But the DEA sometimes ensures that drugs never reach the street
another way, the newspaper reported: by having local authorities
seize the drugs before they are delivered to the local dealers. In
some cases, even the officers making the seizures don't realize that
busts were planned in advance by their superiors.
   Newspaper clippings on the fake seizures help convince the
traffickers that the seizures are for real, according to the
Chronicle, which determined that at least two highly publicized
seizures in the Houston area had been staged.
   ``The Colombians, the only way they'll believe you is to show
them the stuff (drugs), the money or the newspaper clips,'' Hill
said.
   Harris County Sheriff Johnny Klevenhagen, whose office cooperated
in at least two staged seizures, said local police agencies use the
tactic only at the request of the DEA. He praised the bogus seizures
as ``very productive in taking illicit drugs off the street.''
   He added that withholding information is a common police
procedure, and that it does not constitute lying for officers to
withhold the true origin of drugs when discussing a staged seizure.
   While many law enforcement agencies defend the ruses on grounds
that they preserve investigations and protect agents, journalists
say the scams raise ethical questions about government deception of
the news media and the public.
   ``If the DEA is willing to lie to the media and public about this
issue, what else might they be willing to lie about?'' asked
Chronicle Managing Editor Tony Pederson.
   ``There seems to have been no accountability in the entire
process,'' Pederson added. ``At least some type of judicial review
has always been necessary for other elements of law enforcement
deception, the key example being wiretaps. But who, if anyone, has
reviewed this process?''
   Paul LaRocque, an assistant journalism professor at Southern
Methodist University in Dallas, asked, ``How can the public trust
what they read in the paper, if the paper has been converted to an
arm of government?''
   The newspaper described two phony seizures in the Houston area.
   In 1984, DEA agents helped smuggle 952 pounds of cocaine into
Harris Country, then abandoned the van containing the contraband at
a prearranged roadblock set up by the Texas Department of Public
Safety, the Chronicle reported. On Aug. 2, 1984, the public safety
department alerted news reporters that troopers had found a cache of
drugs described at the time as one of Texas' largest seizures.
   On Sept. 29 of this year, 60 kilograms of cocaine was planted in
an abandoned car at another spot in Harris County, and left to be
discovered by deputy sheriffs, who notified reporters.
   Alan Spears, one of the state troopers who made the 1984 seizure,
said he never was told that it was staged.
   ``The poor little officer who finds the stuff thinks he's going
to be named officer of the year,'' the newspaper quoted a source as
saying. ``Sometimes you have to push them with a stick to find the
stuff.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional panel has expanded its
investigation of security and personnel problems to include the Los
Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory after a senior computer operator
there was arrested on marijuana charges, a House aide said Sunday.
   As part of the investigation, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., has
asked for the cooperation of Energy Secretary John S. Herrington,
whose department owns the laboratories at Los Alamos, N.M., and
Livermore, Calif. Both are being scrutinized.
   The department also has been plagued by problems that have shut
down production at two major nuclear weapons materials laboratories,
the Savannah River Plant in Aiken, S.C., and the Feed Materials
Production Center in Fernald, Ohio. Production has stopped on two
key weapons materials, tritium and plutonium.
   Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, has asked why the management at
Lawrence Livermore abruptly halted an undercover investigation that
turned up the names of 127 employees suspected of using or dealing
drugs.
   The investigation was expanded to Los Alamos following the arrest
on Oct. 12 of a senior computer operator allegedly carrying 207
pounds of marijuana in his truck, according to a Dingell aide,
Jeffrey Hodges.
   The New York Times, which reported the expanded investigation in
its Sunday editions, identified the computer operator as David
Blossom, 36, and quoted an Energy Department spokesman as saying
that Blossom held a high-level security clearance.
   Energy Department spokesmen could not be reached by telephone in
Washington, or at regional offices in San Francisco or Albuquerque.
   Authorities also are investigating the failure of Livermore
managers to investigate the disappearance of a chemist, Ronald K.
Stump. Hodges said there were suspicions that Stump had been
embezzling from Lawrence Livermore.
   ``He had extremely high level clearance and the lab appeared not
to be doing anything, said Hodges.
   ``Both labs deal in extremely sensitive classified information as
well as nuclear materials and very sophisticated computers,'' said
Hodges. ``It is disturbing if there is any kind of drug problem.''
   ``We received what we feel was very solid information. We are not
just going on a fishing investigation. We are in the initial stages
of an investigation, just how extensive remains to be determined. We
are not making any kind of determination that there is extensive
drug use at Los Alamos lab, but we are looking into it.''

   Could it have been divine
intervention, or pennies from heaven?
   The Rev. Frank Giliberti, a Roman Catholic priest, won
$1,077,777.77 while playing a slot machine at Trump's Castle casino
hotel.
   Giliberti, from the archdiocese of Philadelphia, won the money
Friday at a $1 progressive slot machine, which shares a jackpot with
other slot machines, said Tom Cantone, casino vice president.
   Cantone said Giliberti is a regular slot player at Trump's
Castle, usually playing on Friday. The priest waited for the machine
he wanted to play and then played 1{ hours before hitting the
jackpot, he said.
   Giliberti was accompanied by two friends and had told them he was
going to win a million dollars, Cantone said.
   Giliberti will use the bulk of the money to set up a fund for
teen-agers to attend Catholic High School in Philadelphia, and give
some to charities, along with buying a car for a friend, Cantone
said.
   ``He says he's been set for life working for the church and now
he will help someone else,'' Cantone said.
   Giliberti did not immediately return calls seeking comment Sunday.

   Islamic fundamentalists
called Sunday for strikes to mark the first year of the Palestinian
uprising, and hospital officials said 25 Arabs were shot and wounded
in clashes with Israeli soldiers.
   Another 20-year-old man was seriously injured when a tear gas
grenade hit him in the chest in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp,
hospital officials said.
   The army spokesman said he had reports of only five men being
shot and wounded in the Gaza Strip.
   Also Sunday, a military court sentenced a 21-year-old east
Jerusalem Arab, Elias Thames, to five years in jail for hurling a
homemade firebomb at the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem in April. No
one was injured in the attack.
   In southern Lebanon, soldiers fatally shot a guerrilla during a
clash Saturday night in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone, the
military command said Sunday. The clash occurred when the troops
opened fire on a group of guerrillas they encountered near the
village of Rachaf, six miles north of the Israeli border, the
command said in an announcement telephoned to reporters.
   The Israeli soldiers sustained no casualties, the command said.
   In the northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, 10 Palestinians
were wounded, hospital officials said. They said Israeli troops
opened fire after youths threw stones at them.
   Clashes were also reported in five other Gaza villages and
refugee camps.
   The Palestinians who were wounded by bullets included three
teen-agers from the village of Deir Al Balah and three from the Khan
Yunis refugee camp, according to hospital officials who demanded
anonymity. Five other people were wounded in Jabaliya refugee camp
and one in Rafah on the Egyptian border.
   The army confirmed two Palestinians were wounded in
stone-throwing clashes in the village of Abasan Kabirah south of
Gaza City.
   In the West Bank, a Palestinian was shot and wounded in the
shoulder when his car failed to stop at an army roadblock, the army
said. An Arab reporter said soldiers shot at the vehicle for no
apparent reason.
   The army reported curfews in the Nuseirat refugee camp and the
Sabra quarter of Gaza City. Curfews keep people off the streets.
   At least 316 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured
since the uprising against Israeli rule began in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip Dec. 8. Eleven Israelis also have died.
   In Gaza City, a newly painted wall sign showed an illustration of
a firebomb with the statement ``No other option than this.'' It was
signed by the PLO-backed United Leadership of the Uprising.
   The clandestine PLO underground called a strike Monday in honor
of 5,656 Palestinians currently held in Israeli custody. The army
said 1,590 of the total are detained without benefit of trial.
   Three other strikes were called in a leaflet issued by the
Islamic Resistance Movement, which is known by the acronym Hamas,
Arabic for ``zeal.''
   One was demanded for Tuesday to coincide with the anniversary of
the 1947 U.N. resolution proposing that the British Mandate in
Palestine be partitioned into two states, one Arab and one Jewish.
   On Dec. 8, a strike was ordered to mark the end of a full year of
the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, the leaflet
said. A second strike on Dec. 9 signal the start of a second year,
it said.

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan said he
will name the new prime minister on Thursday, two weeks after
Benazir Bhutto's party won the most votes in the first free
elections in more than a decade.
   The official television network said Sunday that Khan will make
the announcement in an address to the nation.
   The newly elected members of Parliament are to be sworn in
Wednesday, the television report said.
   Ms. Bhutto met with the president last week and urged him to let
her left-leaning Pakistan's People's Party form the new government
and make her the first woman prime minister of an Islamic country.
   The party led by Ms. Bhutto, who is the daughter of the late
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, won 93 of 207 seats in the Nov.
16 general elections. Her right-wing rival, the Islamic Democratic
Alliance, got 55 seats in Parliament.
   Ms. Bhutto has insisted she has strong enough support among
possible coalition partners to command a majority in the legislature.
   The Parliament has 237 seats _ 207 for Moslems, 10 for
non-Moslems and 20 for women, who are to be elected by the new
assembly during its first session on Wednesday.
   Under the laws of Islam, which dominates Pakistan, women are not
allowed to appear in public without a veil covering their faces. Few
women participate in public affairs.
   Nawaz Sharif, who leads the right-wing Islamic alliance, has yet
to concede the National Assembly to Ms. Bhutto, saying he can
command a majority if smaller parties and women support him.
   Ms. Bhutto's party has to pick up the votes of 26 members of
Parliament to gain a simple majority, while Sharif's group would
need the support of another 64 legislators.
   Sharif was a protege of the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq,
who died with U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel and 28 others in an Aug.
17 plane crash that an investigation blamed on sabotage. No charges
have been filed, and a probe is continuing.
   Zia overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father in 1977. Bhutto was hanged in
1979 after being convicted of complicity in a murder conspiracy.
   Zia appointed Sharif chief minister of the populous Punjab
province after firing his civilian government in May.

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition party supporters seized city halls
throughout the state of Michoacan and demanded the resignation of
the governor, a member of the ruling party, officials said Sunday.
   Democratic Front supporters occupied 19 city halls Saturday
afternoon to force the ouster of Gov. Luis Martinez Villicana,
according to a state government statement. Villicana is a member of
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   The government newspaper El Nacional quoted Marciano Razo
Amezcua, leader of the Democratic Front in Michoacan, as saying that
Villicana had ``squandered the public treasury'' and ``fomented
political hatred'' in the southwestern state.
   The newspaper quoted Razo Amezcua as saying the seizures were
unrelated to the Dec. 1 inauguration of President-elect Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   Salinas was the Institutional Revolutionary Party's victorious
candidate in the bitterly contested July 6 elections, which
opposition leaders said were plagued by fraud.
   The presidential runner-up, Democratic Front candidate Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, won the most votes in Michoacan, his home state. Although
the governing party has not lost a presidential election since it
was founded in 1929, its margin of victory in the last election was
its smallest ever.
   An official in the Michoacan state press office paper said the
city halls were seized by members of the Authentic Revolutionary
Party, part of the Democratic Front coalition. The official, who
spoke to The Associated Press on condition his name be withheld,
said there had been no violence.
   ``We are negotiating with them, even bringing them food,'' said
the official, speaking by telephone from Morelia, the state capital
about 130 miles west of Mexico City.
   The official said that the municipal buildings seized were all in
small towns and that most of the occupying groups also were small.
He said only 10 people were at the city hall in Tocumba but about
800 had occupied the building at Zacapu.
   It was unclear Sunday how many city halls remained occupied.
Police in Tocumba and Jiquilpan said that their city halls were not
occupied Sunday afternoon, but that crowds were gathered outside.
The state official in Morelia said that several attempted
occupations had failed.
   ``State authorities will not and cannot accept this insane
pressure, nor any other provocation,'' state government secretary
Genevevo Figueroa Zamudio said in a statement.
   Figueroa Zamudio accused opposition supporters of releasing
prisoners from some city jails and said he thought the seizures only
were the first of a series of ``provocations'' planned by the
opposition.
   What the opposition wants, said Figueroa Zamudio, ``is to provoke
a vigorous response from authorities that could be painted as
repressive, thus making themselves martyrs and victims.''
   ``That they will not get,'' the statement said.
   Opposition senator Cristobal Arias said the only objective of the
protests was to achieve Martinez Villicana's dismissal, the Mexico
City newspaper La Jornada reported.
   The magazine Proceso, which frequently criticizes the government,
ran an article on Martinez Villicana in its latest issue, dubbing
him ``the unpopular governor of Michoacan.'' He was elected in 1986
to a six-year term.

   President Reagan on Sunday endorsed
the decision to block Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's appearance
at the United Nations, saying Americans can't be seen as ``patsies''
to terrorism.
   ``I agree very much with his decision,'' Reagan said of Secretary
of State George P. Shultz's move on Saturday to deny Arafat a visa
to speak before the U.N. General Assembly in New York next month.
   Shultz said he would not grant Arafat a waiver of U.S. policy
against giving visas to terrorists. Arafat, the chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, ``knows of, condones and lends
support'' to acts of terrorism, Shultz said.
   Asked whether he thought the PLO continued to sponsor terrorism,
Reagan said, ``I think there was enough to justify not granting a
waiver.'' He said it would have been wrong to give a visa to Arafat,
who last spoke to the United Nations in 1974.
   ``I think the other way would have sent out the wrong signal _
that we are patsies,'' Reagan said at Point Mugu Naval Air Station
near here as he boarded Air Force One to return to Washington from
his Thanksgiving holiday.
   But Reagan said he was not involved in the decision.
   Though he agreed with Shultz, Reagan said, ``You recognize that
officially it didn't make any difference whether I did or not
because under the law that is the province of the secretary of
state.'
   President-elect George Bush was not consulted about Shultz's
decision, spokesman Stephen Hart told reporters. Asked if Bush
supported the action, Hart said: ``I don't have any direct comment
on the situation from him.''
   Hart added: ``It was an administration decision and he has been a
loyal supporter of the administration.''
   Reagan, meantime, said U.S. officials are ``available and are
willing to negotiate at any time'' for peace in the Middle East.
``We are the ones with the peace plan.''
   Arab spokesmen have criticized the U.S. decision to deny Arafat a
visa, calling it a big mistake. Arafat said he will ask the United
Nations to move its session on Palestinian issues to Geneva,
Switzerland.
   Three Democratic senators seeking to be elected majority leader
by Senate colleagues this week also said they agreed with Shultz's
action. The three _ Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, J. Bennett Johnston
of Louisiana and George Mitchell of Maine _ said they did not
believe the United States was caving into pressure from the Israelis
by denying Arafat the visa.
   ``The United States should indicate to one and all that we stand
against terrorism, and I think this was a very dramatic way of doing
it,'' Inouye said in a joint appearance with the others on NBC's
``Meet the Press.''
   ``The PLO has members ... who are engaged actively in terrorism,
and as long as that organization does, I don't think they should be
allowed to speak at the U.N.,'' said Johnston.
   On his return to Washington, Reagan will prepare for his Dec. 7
session with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in New York. In
mid-week, Reagan will meet with his designated successor, Vice
President George Bush, who will also take part in the talks.
   Reagan has a relatively light schedule at the White House this
week, with several ceremonial events planned, and the first couple
has several social events on their calendar. Reagan will be the
guest of honor at a private dinner scheduled for Tuesday by
Republican members of the Senate.
   The president and first lady will remain in Washington until Dec.
23, when they will fly back to California to spend the holiday
period socializing with friends in Los Angeles and Palm Springs.
   Leaving his ranch for the last time as president, Reagan said,
``It's very sentimental.''

   Rescuers searched during a storm Sunday for
a Turkish freighter carrying 23 crewmen that was reported sinking in
the Mediterranean a day earlier, news agencies said.
   Aircraft and ships were scouring an area about 20 miles off the
coast of Finiki for the Sonmezler, the semi-official Anatolia news
agency reported.
   Anatolia quoted Antalya Gov. Erol Tezcan as saying a Sonmezler
crew member radioed a distress call about 10:45 p.m. (2:45 p.m. EST)
Saturday and said: ``We are sinking some 20 miles away from Finike.''
   Anatolia said the crew member told the Finike ship-to-shore radio
station that the Sonmezler's 23 crew members had boarded the ship's
lifeboats.
   ``The ship is not important, you rescue us,'' the station quoted
the crew member as saying.
   Anatolia said no details were available about the Sonmezler
because authorities had not yet identified the owner of the vessel.

<HEAD>Bush Not Consulted On Arafat Decision</HEAD>

   President-elect George Bush was not consulted
in the Reagan administration's decision to deny a visa to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, a spokesman said Sunday.
   The spokesman, Stephen Hart, said the decision to deny the
chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization entry into the
country to give a speech to the United Nations was ``a State
Department decision.''
   ``In that answer is the fact that he was not consulted,'' Hart
told reporters travelling with the vice president on Air Force Two
as he returned from a four-day Thanksgiving vacation in Maine.
   Asked if Bush supported the move, Hart said, ``I don't have any
direct comment on the situation from him.''
   But, Hart added, ``It was an administration decision and he has
been a loyal supporter of the administration.''
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz announced Saturday that
Arafat would not be given a visa because he and the PLO condone
terrorism. President Reagan wholeheartedly endorsed Shultz's action.
   Bush, his wife Barbara and family spaniel ``Millie,'' returned
here from the oceanside family vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Mrs. Bush told reporters the visit this time to Kennebunkport
``was more emotional'' than other times, because of the warm welcome
they had received from townspeople.
   During the vacation, the vice president at one point played
handyman, shortening electrical cords of various appliances in the
kitchen that plugged went a wall socketboard, according to Mrs. Bush.
   She also said that she planned to accompany the vice president on
Dec. 7 when he travels to New York for a luncheon with Reagan and
Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   She said she is looking forward to meeting Gorbachev's wife,
Raisa.
   Earlier Sunday, the Bushes, accompanied by daughter Dorothy
LeBlond, attended morning worship services at the First
Congregational Church of Kennebunkport.
   Bush is to meet with former rival Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole on Monday at a private White House lunch.
   Transition team sources also said that the vice president this
week would announce his selection of Texas oil man Robert Mosbacher,
a longtime friend, as Commerce secretary.
   Bush is also mulling over his selection for defense secretary.
Former Sen. John Tower of Texas reportedly has the inside track.

   Soviet and French cosmonauts practiced maneuvers

on-board systems Sunday, their first full day in space.
   The crew of Frenchman Jean-Loup Chretien and two Soviets,
Alexandr Volkov and Sergei Krikalev, circled the earth every 90
minutes, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   Their Soyuz TM-7 spacecraft blasted off from Baikonur Cosmodrome
Saturday evening with French President Francois Mitterand on hand to

   The Soyuz is to dock with the Mir space station Tuesday evening.
The three Soviet cosmonauts aboard the Mir took Sunday off, Tass

<HEAD>Roh Plans Cabinet Shuffle To Defuse Anger Over Disgraced
Predecessor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo may name a
civilian defense minister as part of major Cabinet reshuffle in an
effort to appease public anger over his disgraced predecessor,
officials said Sunday.
   Government and ruling party sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Roh was expected to announce the reshuffle next
month. The reorganization could affect up to 70 senior officials,
they said.
   ``To resolve the discontent of the opposition, we realize the
quality of the shake-up is very important, and it is highly likely
that we would have a civilian defense minister,'' one government
official said.
   A well-placed source in the governing Democratic Justice Party
confirmed the plans. ``President Roh really means business, and he
wants to reflect the opposition's view as much as possible,'' he
said.
   In a nationally televised speech Saturday, Roh appealed to the
nation to forgive his disgraced predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, and
promised speedier democratic reform, including a major shake-up of
his government and party to assuage public anger over the former
strongman's rule.
   Chun, who stepped down in February, went into rural exile last
Wednesday after coming under mounting attacks for corruption and
abuse of power under his seven-year rule. He surrendered all his
property, worth $24 million, in a gesture of atonement, but has
denied any personal guilt.
   Opposition leaders refused to accept Roh's plea for mercy for
Chun and called for a thorough probe by the National Assembly or a
special prosecutor. Thousands of people have staged street protests
to demand Chun's arrest.
   Faced with the opposition's cool response, government and
governing party officials are hoping that major democratic reforms
promised in Roh's speech, including a government shake-up, will
effect a breakthrough.
   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae is likely to be retained, but most
key economic officials held over from Chun's administration,
including Economic Planning Minister Rha Woong-bae, would be
replaced, they said.
   Most significant would be the possible replacement of Defense
Minister Oh Ja-bok, a retired four-star general, with a civilian who
has no military background, the sources said.
   The last time South Korea had a civilian defense minister was in
1960, when the late President Park Chung-hee staged a military coup
and ousted a popularly elected government led by then Prime Minister
Chang Myun.
   Since the 1960 coup, South Korea has been governed by former
generals. Roh, also an former general, succeeded Chun in February
after winning elections last December. But his government is closely
identified with the military establishment.
   Roh also pledged to release all political prisoners, reinstate
thousands of illegally purged officials and compensate families of
victims of the bloody government suppression of the 1980 civil
uprising in southern Kwangju city that, by official count, left
about 200 people dead. Activists say the toll was much higher.

   A woman faces a first-degree murder charge in
the beating death of her young son, who died hours after the woman
gave birth to a third son.
   Mary Lee Collins of Zephyrhills, described by neighbors and
official records as an abusive mother, was arrested Saturday. She
was being held Sunday without bond in the Hillsborough County Jail.
   Her 21-month-old son, Joshua, who died Friday, had been returned
to Collins last month by the state after he spent months in
protective custody after an earlier alleged beating incident, police
said.
   Both Joshua and his 4-year-old brother, Nathan, were taken from
Collins, 21, in July when she was arrested on charges of abusing
Joshua. Collins was arrested after she told police she had grabbed
Joshua by the throat and pushed him into a tombstone in a cemetery
to stop him from crying.
   She was later released; the children were returned to her a month
ago.
   Officials of the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services said they had no comment on the case.
   Police spokesman Steve Cole said that sometime Wednesday
afternoon, Collins kicked Joshua in the head before leaving for the
hospital to deliver her third son. She left Joshua with her
boyfriend, Raymond Leet, who was unaware of the beating and noticed
only that the boy seemed drowsy.
   Collins was released from the hospital Friday, after giving birth
early that morning, and brought Joshua to the hospital emergency
room shortly thereafter. The child was pronounced dead after doctors
worked in vain for 30 minutes to revive him.
   ``There were obvious signs of child abuse,'' Cole said.
   Cole said that Collins admitted to beating Joshua. The unnamed
newborn and Nathan were taken into protective custody by the state,
he said.

   Hundreds of ethnic Croatians demanding a
homeland in Yugoslavia demonstrated outside the Yugoslav Consulate
Sunday. Police said a gunman wounded a teen-ager as several
protesters climbed the wall of the compound.
   Yugoslavia strongly protested to Australia over the
demonstration, said Yugoslavia's state news agency Tanjug. The
report from Belgrade said demonstrators entered the compound and
tried to desecrate the national flag while police stood by.
   In a separate demonstration earlier Sunday, some of 2,000
protesters threw eggs and placards at a limosine carrying visiting
Greek President Christo Sartzetakis. The protesters demanded that
Greece grant Macedonian autonomy.
   The shooting victim, a 13-year-old boy, was wounded in the neck
and throat and listed in satisfactory condition at St. Vincent's
Hospital, police said.
   The shooting occurred as 1,500 protesters demanding a Croatian
homeland marked Yugoslav National Day, the anniversary of the
communist government.
   Sgt. Peter Heffernan said about five youths tried to scale the
walls of the consulate in the Sydney suburb of Woollhara.
   Heffernan said police officers tried to contain the youths, who
turned to the demonstrators and incited them to chant slogans.
   ``It was at that time a man from the consulate came out. He had a
pistol and he fired two shots,'' Heffernan said. ``As a result of
that, one of the demonstrators _ the 13-year-old boy _ was shot in
the throat.''
   The consulate claimed diplomatic immunity for the shooting, said
Sgt. Wayne Bottom, a New South Wales police spokesman.
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, Tanjug said that in the
absence of police intervention the consulate staff ``physically
confronted the attackers. In self-defense, warning shots were fired
in the air from the building.''
   But a man who answered the phone at the consulate claimed the
gunshots came from outside the building.
   ``The shooting was from one of the terrorists that attacked the
consulate. There was no police protection,'' he said. The man
refused to give his name and hung up the telephone.
   No arrests were made, Heffernan said.
   Australian Associated Press said Yugoslav Ambassador Boris Cazal
was summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra, the federal
capital, for an explanation.
   A day earlier, 500 mostly teen-age Yugoslavs demonstrated outside
the consulate. Police arrested 13 people.
   Sydney has a large migrant population from Yugoslavia, which has
been rocked by ethnic strife and economic troubles in recent months.
   Also in Sydney, Macedonian protesters hurled eggs and placards at
a car carrying Sartzetakis when he arrived Sunday at a hotel for a
reception, police said.
   Police said some of the 2,000 demonstrators demanding
independence stormed the car.
   Police charged one demonstrator with assault.
   Macedonia, an ancient kingdom in southeastern Europe in the
Balkan Peninsula, is now a region divided among Greece, Bulgaria and
Yugoslavia. The Macedonian language is akin to Greek.
   Yugoslavia was proclaimed a nation on Nov. 29, 1945, with Croatia
and Serbia as two of its six republics.

<TEXT>
   President Chadli Bendjedid on Sunday
promised that political reforms would be introduced soon but said a
multiparty political system in this rigidly controlled nation ``is
not presently possible.''
   Bendjedid made his remarks to delegates at the 6th congress of
the ruling National Liberation Front. Delegates are expected to
approve reforms proposed by Bendjedid after violent anti-government
riots in October left scores dead.
   This North African nation of 25 million has been a one-party
socialist state since independence from France in 1962, with the
front controlling virtually every aspect of the country's political
and economic life.
   In his speech, the president said a package of reforms would be
introduced into Parliament soon. But he ruled out immediate moves to
allow legal opposition but suggested a referendum on the issue could
be held later.
   For now, he urged moves to bring a wider range of people and
opinions into the existing party structure.
   ``A multiparty system is not presently possible,'' Bendjedid
said. ``The question will be put to the people if conviction of its
need is widely shared. At the present time, a multiparty system is a
danger for the unity of the nation.''
   Bendjedid has been trying to ease the party's grip on affairs in
recent years. The effort was speeded up considerably when violent
protests in October _ largely over rising prices, food and housing
shortages, and unemployment _ broke out in Algiers and other major
cities.
   Official accounts said 176 were killed, but unofficial reports
said the death toll was as high as 500.
   In announcing his intention to institute reform last month,
Bendjedid heightened expectations. Many observers say that if he
does not deliver at least some visible change, renewed violence may
erupt.
   Bendjedid is attempting to loosen the rigid socialist economic
structure and force state-owned companies to perform competitively.
Recently plummeting oil prices have limited the government's
capacity to keep up financial props under unproductive businesses.
   The government's program, as published in the press, speaks only
in general terms. It says the National Liberation Front ``must
completely free itself from the temptation of direct and
hegemonistic responsibilities in the state apparatus, in the elected
assemblies, in the economy and in the social and professional
organizations.''
   How this is to be accomplished is not clear. The president is not
without opposition, both from within the still-powerful army and
among professional party militants. Nonetheless, he was widely
expected to get his way at the congress.
   The two-day congress is being held in a mushroom-shaped white
arena in the suburban July 5 sports complex on the outskirts of the
capital.
   Except for the first few minutes of opening formalities, foreign
reporters and most of the local press were barred from the complex.
The official news agency APS and the state radio carried reports on
the proceedings.
   The party also is electing a new secretary-general, who under the
constitution becomes the sole candidate in the presidential
elections, now scheduled for February. It is widely presumed that
Bendjedid will seek a third five-year term.
   This North African nation of 25 million has been a one-party
socialist state since independence from France in 1962, with the
front controlling virtually every aspect of the country's political
and economic life.

   An attempt was made to assassinate the
leading opponent of a Middle Eastern nation's government, a nephew
of the man said Sunday.
   Police said they had not established a motive.
   About 10 shots were fired from a passing car Saturday night at a
group of people entering a restaurant, including North Yemeni
opposition leader Ibrahim Alwazir, said Hani Issac, a spokesman for
Alwazir.
   North Yemen, a nation of about 5.9 million in the southern
Arabian peninsula, is a U.S. ally. Its southern neighbor, South
Yemen, has a pro-Soviet government.
   Alwazir was unhurt but Naji Isa was wounded in the left leg, said
police Lt. Ray Wysocki. Isa, an associate of Alwazir, was in serious
but stable condition Sunday at Oakwood Hospital, Wysocki said.
   Alwazir, 56, was on a three-day visit from his home in
Washington, D.C., Issac said. Dearborn is home to many members of
the area's large Arab community.
   Alwazir and several other people had gathered for an informal
meeting at the Peacock restaurant, Issac said.
   In Washington, Tarek Alwazir, a nephew and spokesman for Ibrahim
Alwazir, called the shooting an assassination attempt against his
uncle.
   ``We are accusing the North Yemeni military leadership of a
terrorist assassination attempt which, thank God, was
unsuccessful,'' he said.
   Telephone calls to the North Yemen Embassy in Washington went
unanswered Sunday afternoon.
   Wysocki said authorities were looking for two men in a black
Cadillac, adding that no motive had been established.
   Tarek Alwazir said his uncle was forced to flee his homeland in
1948, at the age of 16, and has split his time between the United
States and Saudi Arabia for the last 20 years.

   The Soviet Union defeated Bulgaria 3-1
Sunday in the Chess Olympiad with one round left, virtually
guaranteeing a Soviet gold medal.
   The Soviets had 37 points out of a possible 52 after the 13th
round Sunday, with England in second with 33 points.
   Even in the extremely unlikely event of the Soviets losing 0-4 in
the 14th and final round on Tuesday and England winning 4-0, the
Soviets are likely to take first place under the tie-breaking system.
   Each match consists of four games. A win scores a point, and a
draw scores a half.
   In the separate women's championship, Hungary defeated the United
States 2.5-0.5 to move even with the Soviets. Both teams have 31
points out of 39.
   The Soviet women defeated Cuba 2-1.
   The Soviet team was weakened by the dramatic elopement of its
second-ranked player, Grandmaster Elena Akhmilovskaya, with the U.S.
men's non-playing team captain, John Donaldson, on Saturday.
   With the Soviets triumphant in the men's competition, their
women's team, which has dominated with 10 victories in 11 Olympiads,
faces an edge-of-the-seat race with the Hungarians in the final
round.
   The Soviet men's victory came when world champion Garri Kasparov
scored a brilliant revenge victory against Bulgaria's leading
grandmaster, Kiril Georgiev.
   In other men's competition, second-seeded England, which drew 2-2
with the Philippines, remained a point ahead of the United States
and the Netherlands, which held third place jointly with 32 points.
   The United States, which has won the bronze medals in the last
three Olympiads, defeated Sweden 2.5-1.5 when Grandmaster Sergei
Kudrin defeated Dragulob Damjanovic. The Netherlands won by the same
margin against Sweden.
   The Philippines, seeded 29th at the start of the competition, was
poised to make the best ever result by an Asian team. It is fifth
with 31.5 points and one unfinished game.
   The battle for gold in the women's competition and for silver and
bronze in the men's will be fought in the 14th round on Tuesday. The
adjourned games will be completed on Monday.
   The Hungarian women's team features a remarkable trio of sisters,
including Judit Polgar, the highest ranked 12-year-old in history.
She has so far won 11 games and conceded only one draw.
   Although some spectators felt sympathy for the Soviets after they
lost their player, several broke into applause when 17-year-old
Maritza Arribas of Cuba defeated Soviet Grandmaster Marta Litinskaya
to leave the Hungarians tied for first.
   Organized by the 127-member World Chess Federation, the Olympiad
is a biennial world team championship with teams from 106 nations.

<HEAD>Very Cold And Heavy, Blowing Snow In Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Bitterly cold air and high wind blasted across the northern
Plains on Sunday, and more than a foot of blowing snow blocked roads
in parts of Minnesota.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus declared a state of emergency for
Ruleville as a result of damage caused by a tornado, which destroyed
four homes, damaged at least 38 others as well as three schools in
the town of about 3,500.
   Sunday morning's low was 21 degrees below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont. But in the East, there were record highs in the
60s, including 61 at Allentown, Pa.; 67 at Syracuse, N.Y.; and 63 at
Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, Pa.
   A combination of low afternoon temperatures across the northern
Plains and wind gusting as high as 50 mph drove wind chill
temperatures down to 30 degrees below zero in some areas, the
National Weather Service said.
   The high wind was caused by an intense area of low pressure over
southern Ontario, and cold, moist air flowing around that low
produced snow over the upper Mississippi Valley.
   In Minnesota, overnight snowfall amounts included 16 inches at
Aitkin; 12 inches at Long Prairie and Bagley; 11 inches at Brainerd;
10 inches at Ely; 9 inches at Alexandria, Poplar Lake and Hibbing,
and nearly 9 inches at Duluth.
   Blowing snow over western Minnesota reduced visibility to near
zero and some roads in the region were impassable. Snow plows were
pulled off some roads because of the poor conditions.
   Snow in Wisconsin amounted to between 1 and 3 inches in Polk
County. Cold air drawing moisture from the warmer water of Lake
Superior was expected to produce ``lake effect'' snow along the
shores of upper Michigan, where up to 10 inches was possible by
morning.
   The Colorado mountains also had stormy weather, with wind gusting
to 67 mph overnight and 2 inches of new snow falling at Berthoud
Pass. Winds clocked at more than 60 mph were reported at Red
Mountain Pass, which received 7 inches of snow. Some overnight snow
totals in the Colorado ski areas included over 5 inches at Vail and
4 inches at Copper Mountain.
   A storm over northern Utah that began Friday night and continued
through most of Saturday dropped 40 inches of snow at Alta Ski
Resort, and neighboring Snowbird got about 30 inches, the service
said. That storm was blamed for numerous traffic accidents,
including one fatality.
   Freeze warnings were posted all the way into south-central Texas,
with a hard freeze warning for the hill country of southern Texas.
   High winds were reported in Wyoming, creating blowing snow
conditions and gusts up to 70 mph were expected along the eastern
slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Montana.
   Elsewhere, strong thunderstorms developed along a cold front from
northwestern Florida into western North Carolina, and showers were
scattered over sections of the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
valleys and over the middle and northern Atlantic Coast.
   Heavier rainfall amounts included 2.32 inches at Montgomery,
Ala., with 0.75 of an inch at Athens, Ga. Rain also fell in the
Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Dickinson, N.D., to 86 at Fort Myers, Fla.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from Florida
to the middle Atlantic Coast, with widespread rain over the central
and northern Appalachians and New England. Snow showers were
forecast over the Great Lakes states. Rain was forecast over the
Pacific Northwest, with snow over the northern Rockies and parts of
the region between the Rockies and the mountains of the Northwest.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted over eastern parts of the
Dakotas, the upper Mississippi Valley, Iowa and northern Illinois,
and western sections of the upper Great Lakes; in the 30s and 40s
from the Pacific Northwest across the northern and central Rockies,
the northern and central Plains, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, the
Tennessee and Ohio valleys, much of the Great Lakes and the

<HEAD>Onassis Will is Opened, Gives Millions to Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 3-year-old daughter of Christina
Onassis will inherit most of her mother's $500 million fortune and a
five-member committee has been appointed to manage the estate, a
source close to the family said Sunday.
   Miss Onassis, the 37-year-old daughter of the late shipping
magnate Aristotle Onassis, died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Nov.
19. An autopsy report gave the cause of death as acute pulmonary
edema, accumulation of fluid in the lungs.
   A five-member committee named to execute the will includes
Thierry Roussel, the fourth former husband of Miss Onassis and the
father of her only child, Athena, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Frenchman Roussel, who was divorced from Miss Onassis in
October 1987, also will serve as Athena's legal guardian, said the
source.
   The will, which was dated Oct. 12, 1988, was opened before an
Athens magistrate on Friday, according to the source.
   The child will receive the bulk of her mother's estate, the
source said. A share of the wealth will also go to Miss Onassis'
longtime companion, Helen Syrou, as well as Roussel, household
staff, 10 business associates, and other friends and relatives.
   The source said the will directs the committee to hold Athen's
hundreds of millions in trust for her until she is 18. In addition
to Roussel, the panel includes three members of the Alexander
Onassis Public Benefit Foundation and a legal adviser to the Onassis
companies.
   Aristotle Onassis set up the foundation after his son died in a
plane crash at Athens Airport in 1973. When the father died in Paris
in 1975, half of his estate went to the foundation and the remainder
to Christina. Her share is estimated at $500 million.
   The will also directs the committee to manage the Onassis group
of companies, the source said. They include shipping, mining, and
real estate holdings around the world.
   The source said all decisions by the five-member committee will
be made by majority vote.
   Miss Onassis' body was flown to Greece, where she was buried
Saturday next to her father and brother on the family-owned island
of Skorpios in the Ionian sea. She lived in Paris and was the
stepdaughter of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President
Kennedy who subsequently married Onassis.
   Athena did not attend the burial. She was said to be in
Switzerland with relatives.

<TEXT>
   Bitterly cold air and high wind blasted across the northern
Plains on Sunday, and more than a foot of blowing snow blocked roads
in parts of Minnesota.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus declared a state of emergency for
Ruleville as a result of damage caused by a tornado, which destroyed
four homes, damaged at least 38 others as well as three schools in
the town of about 3,500.
   Sunday morning's low was 21 degrees below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont. But in the East, there were record highs in the
60s, including 61 at Allentown, Pa.; 67 at Syracuse, N.Y.; and 63 at
Wilkes-Barre and Scranton, Pa.
   A combination of low afternoon temperatures across the northern
Plains and wind gusting as high as 50 mph drove wind chill
temperatures down to 30 degrees below zero in some areas, the
National Weather Service said.
   The high wind was caused by an intense area of low pressure over
southern Ontario, and cold, moist air flowing around that low
produced snow over the upper Mississippi Valley.
   In Minnesota, overnight snowfall amounts included 16 inches at
Aitkin; 12 inches at Long Prairie and Bagley; 11 inches at Brainerd;
10 inches at Ely; 9 inches at Alexandria, Poplar Lake and Hibbing,
and nearly 9 inches at Duluth.
   Blowing snow over western Minnesota reduced visibility to near
zero and some roads in the region were impassable. Snow plows were
pulled off some roads because of the poor conditions.
   Snow in Wisconsin amounted to between 1 and 3 inches in Polk
County. Cold air drawing moisture from the warmer water of Lake
Superior was expected to produce ``lake effect'' snow along the
shores of upper Michigan, where up to 10 inches was possible by
morning.
   The Colorado mountains also had stormy weather, with wind gusting
to 67 mph overnight and 2 inches of new snow falling at Berthoud
Pass. Winds clocked at more than 60 mph were reported at Red
Mountain Pass, which received 7 inches of snow. Some overnight snow
totals in the Colorado ski areas included over 5 inches at Vail and
4 inches at Copper Mountain.
   A storm over northern Utah that began Friday night and continued
through most of Saturday dropped 40 inches of snow at Alta Ski
Resort, and neighboring Snowbird got about 30 inches, the service
said. That storm was blamed for numerous traffic accidents,
including one fatality.
   Freeze warnings were posted all the way into south-central Texas,
with a hard freeze warning for the hill country of southern Texas.
   High winds were reported in Wyoming, creating blowing snow
conditions and gusts up to 70 mph were expected along the eastern
slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Montana.
   Elsewhere, strong thunderstorms developed along a cold front from
northwestern Florida into western North Carolina, and showers were
scattered over sections of the lower Mississippi and Tennessee
valleys and over the middle and northern Atlantic Coast.
   Heavier rainfall amounts included 2.32 inches at Montgomery,
Ala., with 0.75 of an inch at Athens, Ga. Rain also fell in the
Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Dickinson, N.D., to 86 at Fort Myers, Fla.
   For Monday, showers and thunderstorms were forecast from Florida
to the middle Atlantic Coast, with widespread rain over the central
and northern Appalachians and New England. Snow showers were
forecast over the Great Lakes states. Rain was forecast over the
Pacific Northwest, with snow over the northern Rockies and parts of
the region between the Rockies and the mountains of the Northwest.
   Highs in the 20s were predicted over eastern parts of the
Dakotas, the upper Mississippi Valley, Iowa and northern Illinois,
and western sections of the upper Great Lakes; in the 30s and 40s
from the Pacific Northwest across the northern and central Rockies,
the northern and central Plains, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, the
Tennessee and Ohio valleys, much of the Great Lakes and the
Appalachians to northern New England; in the 70s over southern
California, parts of the desert Southwest, the northern Florida
Peninsula and along the southern Atlantic Coast; in the 80s over the
southern Florida Peninsula; and generally in the 50s and 60s over
the remainder of the nation.

<HEAD>President Calls for Feuding Leaders to Make Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Raif Dizdarevic moved
Sunday to try to stem the nation's wave of ethnic strife by urging
regional leaders to make peace.
   He said the feud between the nation's largest republic, Serbia,
and its province of Kosovo ``imperils the stability of the country.''
   He warned of ``conflicts and confrontations ... between
leaderships of individual republics and provinces, which burden the
overall situation in the country, weaken unity and poison
inter-nationalist relations.''
   About 100,000 ethnic Albanians took to the streets earlier this
month to protest attempts by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic to
take more control over Kosovo. The province is nominally autonomous,
but Serbia exercises some power there.
   Ethnic Albanians predominate in the province near the Albanian
border, and many Serbs say they are persecuted there. They have
mounted months of mass protests to support Milosevic's drive.
   The strife has already forced two leaders in Kosovo and several
in Serbia's other province, Vojvodina, to resign under pressure from
Milosevic and his backers.
   In an interview with the state Tanjug news agency, the president
said recent demonstrations in Kosovo have seriously worsened the
``already very grave situation'' in the country.
   He did not elaborate, but protests have also sprung up this year
over economic problems such as 15 percent unemployment and 240
percent annual inflation in this communist-ruled country.
   ``The continuation of the situation of distrust and disunity
between leaders of Serbia and Kosovo cannot be tolerated any
longer,'' Dizdarevic said.
   The president did, however, assert a need for ``broad,
democratically implemented'' personnel replacement in Kosovo. The
remarks seemed to back Milosevic's position.
   Radio Belgrade quoted unofficial sources Sunday as predicting
more demonstrations if the provincial leadership purges continue and
the two leaders are not reinstated.
   Yugoslavia consists of a fragile federation of six republics and
two autonomous provinces, each with its own government and party
structure. Some of the other republics and their nationalities fear
and resent Serbia's importance.
   The decentralized system of government was devised in the late
President Tito's 1974 constitution to prevent one republic from
gaining sway over the others.
   The most recent eruption of ethnic violence in Kosovo was in
1981, when at least nine people died when an estimated 40,000 ethnic
Albanians clashed with police. The protesters were demanding that
Kosovo become a full-fledged Yugoslav republic.

<HEAD>11-Year-Old Prodigy Prepares For High School Graduation, Medical
School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy expects to graduate this year
from a high school for academically advanced students, then try to
break the record for the youngest person to finish medical school.
   In some ways, Balamurali Ambati seems like a perfectly normal
child who likes stamp-collecting, playing basketball with his
friends and testing his video game skills.
   But he's already a senior at Baltimore City College High School
and has some decidedly uncommon interests, including college
courses. And he's cowritten a book on AIDS with his 17-year-old
brother, who's already a medical student.
   ``He is a very goal-oriented, conscientious, highly motivated and
self-directed student,'' said Jean Johnson, assistant principal of
the high school.
   He was born in Vellore, India, but his family moved to Buffalo,
N.Y., when he was 3. Within four months, said his father, Ambati
Murali, Bala was speaking and writing English.
   By age 4, the boy had mastered multiplication and was beginning
to learn basic calculus, said his father, an industrial consultant.
   In 1986, the family moved to Baltimore, where Bala completed
seventh grade at Roland Park Public School. In the next two years,
he advanced through middle and high school.
   In addition to his academic success, Bala fits in well with older
classmates, Ms. Johnson said.
   ``He tells jokes and has a great sense of humor,'' she said.
``He's a delightful person. It's been a pleasure to have him here.''
   Bala said his age has not precluded friendships with other
students. ``Everyone is initially astonished,'' he said. ``But
eventually they begin to appreciate my age and accomplishments.''
   While enjoying all academic subjects, Bala said he has ``a
special affinity for math and science, technical topics. In my free
time, I like the challenge of solving mathematical problems,
inventing new phenomena and new problems.''
   At age 9, he qualified for admittance to The Study for
Mathematically Precocious Youth, a program at Johns Hopkins
University. It monitors the intellectual development of children who
have displayed an exceptional ability in math based on Scholastic
Aptitude Test scores.
   The boy also takes two classes at Towson State University and
participates in the Gifted Math Program correspondence course
offered through the State University of New York in Buffalo.
   Bala expects to enter college next fall with about 70 university
credits already earned through advanced placement and college work.
   With his brother Jaya, 17, a recent graduate of John Hopkins
University and a first-year medical student in New York, Bala has
written a book called ``AIDS; The True Story: The Comprehensive
Guide.'' The brothers are seeking a publisher for the volume.
   They decided to write it after hearing about the plight of a
Florida family ostracized by their community because their three
sons had been infected by the virus that causes acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   ``I and my brother were excited and energized to write a book to
dispel some of the myths about the disease and to make the public
more knowledgeable about the epidemic, especially teen-agers who are
experimenting with sex and drugs,'' Bala said.
   For now, he is concentrating on becoming the world's youngest
physician. The record is held by an Italian who completed medical
school at the age of 18 years and three months.
   ``I wish to be a medical Ph.D to pursue both academic and
clinical medicine,'' he said.

<HEAD>Controversial Seattle Archbishop to Visit Pope</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen,
whose liberal views on church policy have put him at odds with the
Vatican, heads to Rome this week for a visit with Pope John Paul II.
   Many Catholics in the 300,000-member Seattle archdiocese are
hopeful the Vatican will dissolve a three-member commission that has
been reviewing Hunthausen's leadership.
   ``There are a lot of people who hope there will be some closure
to this whole process or issue,'' said Russell Scearce, archdiocese
spokesman.
   In 1985, the Vatican removed Hunthausen's authority in several
major areas, accusing him of being lax in granting church
annulments, general absolution of sins and letting homosexuals meet
in church facilities.
   An auxiliary bishop, Donald Wuerl, was assigned to hold primary
authority in those areas within the archdiocese.
   The discipline was unprecedented in the American church and
distressed many U.S. bishops. The action also sparked extensive
protests, particularly among priests and lay people in Seattle.
   Hunthausen and many others called the split-authority arrangement
humiliating and unworkable.
   In the spring of 1987, Hunthausen's authority was restored, Wuerl
was reassigned and the Rev. Thomas Murphy was named coadjutor
archbishop. Murphy is traveling with Hunthausen to Rome.
   The commission, consisting of Catholic cardinals of New York,
Chicago and San Francisco, was appointed last year to continue a
review of Hunthausen. The cardinals have met five times with him.
   The trip, which was scheduled for Monday through Friday, is a
regularly scheduled one that each Catholic bishop makes every five
years to deliver a report to the pope.

<TEXT>
   A woman whose husband is accused of
killing their two young sons by placing them in a 1,300-degree
foundry ladle said she has forgiven him and wants to resume a quiet
life together.
   Susan Dobben, 29, said she has chosen to look forward, rather
than reflect on the grisly event.
   She sat in a car on Thanksgiving Day 1987, while her husband,
Bartley James Dobben, 27, took their children into the Muskegon
foundry where he worked. He told her he wanted to pick up a Bible
and show off his workplace to the children.
   While she waited, he placed Bartley Joel, 2, and Peter David, 15
months, in the hot foundry ladle.
   Dobben had previous been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and
paranoid.
   On the day the children died, ``this was not the Bart I knew,''
she said. ``He wasn't taking his medicine (prescribed for
schizophrenia and paranoia). That was it. That was it. We may end up
having to move away from here, but I want him home. With me.''
   She gave birth to their third son, Jacob, in July.
   Mrs. Dobben said earlier this month that she has had to deal with
criticism over how she has handled the ordeal, forgiving her husband
and ending divorce proceedings he initiated in April 1987.
   ``One of my friends told me if I stopped the divorce, I'd have
the whole community against me,'' she said. ``But I couldn't live
with myself if I did. People who knew him before will understand.''
   Even therapists have suggested she was too understanding.
   ``One of the first counselors in Ypsilanti told me that I
couldn't `just forgive' him,'' she said. ``I asked him `Why not?' I
said, `You're telling me I can't be a Christian? I can't forgive?' ''
   More than a year after the event, Mrs. Dobben still is unable to
call Bartley Joel and Peter David by name. She refers to them as
``the kids.''
   As difficult as the ordeal has been, it promises to intensify
when Bart Dobben goes on trial next year on two open counts of
murder. His trial was to have started Nov. 29 but was postponed at
least until late January.
   Both sides said they hadn't received psychiatric tests and were
unable to prepare for what could be a lengthy trial.
   Dobben is confined in the Michigan Center for Forensic Psychiatry
near Ypsilanti.
   Terry Nolan, Dobben's court-appointed attorney, has said he will
maintain Dobben was innocent by reason of insanity.
   Mrs. Dobben said she would tell the court the man who killed her
two children ``was not the Bart I knew.''

   A sheriff's deputy found 1,500 pounds
of cocaine stashed under carpet scraps in the bed of a pickup truck
he stopped for speeding, authorities said.
   The driver allegedly offered sheriff's Deputy Al Reyes a $50,000
bribe to ``just let him go,'' said Lt. Mike Schneewind, an Imperial
County sheriff's department spokesman. The vehicle was stopped
Saturday along a highway about 150 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   The alleged offer prompted a search of the truck, which netted
more than 20 bags of cocaine, the spokesman said. About $2,500 in
$100 bills was found in the truck's cab, he said.
   The cocaine was worth an estimated $80 million.
   The driver, 60-year-old Armando Martinez Cortez, whose address
was unavailable, was turned over to federal authorities in San
Diego, sheriff's deputy Joe Alcazar said Sunday. No charges were
immediately filed.

   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said the United States is violating its U.N. treaty by preventing
PLO chief Yasser Arafat from speaking to the General Assembly.
   He warned that the U.S. decision could hamper Middle East peace
efforts.
   Arab diplomats, meanwhile, said they have enough votes to move
the session from New York to Geneva so Arafat can address the world
body on the Palestinian issue.
   Perez de Cuellar, in a statement released through a spokesman,
said the decision to deny Arafat a visa to enter the country runs
counter to the 1947 agreement under which the United States promises
not to interfere in U.N. matters.
   ``The secretary-general regrets the denial of the visa
application of Mr. Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, by the U.S. authorities,'' said spokesman
Francois Giuliani Sunday night.
   ``Such a decision is incompatible with the obligations of the
host country under the Headquarters Agreement. If maintained, this
action is likely to complicate and render more difficult the further
debates on the question of Palestine and the situation in the Middle
East in the current session of the General Assembly.
   ``This would be unfortunate at a time when, in the view of the
secretary-general, the recent meeting of the Palestine National
Council in Algiers provides fresh opportunities for progress towards
peace in the Middle East,'' Giuliani said.
   The Palestine National Council, a PLO parliament-in-exile,
proclaimed an independent Palestinian state during its meeting in
Algiers on Nov. 15.
   It also implicitly recognized Israel by endorsing a U.N.
resolution that guarantees all Middle East states the right to exist
in peace, and promised to restrict guerrilla activity.
   The PLO has non-voting observer status at the United Nations, and
is a member of the Arab League.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Saturday that Arafat
would not be allowed to attend this week's U.N. debate on the
Palestinian issue because of evidence that Palestine Liberation
Organization elements ``have engaged in terrorism against Americans
and others.''
   President Reagan told reporters in Santa Barbara, Calif., on
Sunday that he supported Shultz' decision. ``I think the other way
would have sent out the wrong signal _ that we are patsies,'' he
said.
   But Jordan and Egypt agreed to spearhead the effort to reconvene
the world body in Geneva, Jordan's official news agency reported.
   Also, Iraq has requested a meeting at noon Monday of the U.N.
Committee on Relations with the Host Country to consider the U.S.
move. U.N. legal authorities also are expected to comment on the
U.S. decision.
   Reaction to the U.S. decision from other nations was largely
negative. Israeli leaders praised it, but Algeria, Egypt, France,
Libya, Norway and Sweden were among nations which protested the
decision. Italy summoned a U.S. Embassy official to explain the
decision.
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League's U.N. ambassador, said Arab
nations felt ``deep anger and outrage'' over the U.S. decision and
will ask the General Assembly to condemn it.
   Arafat wanted to enter the United States to address the U.N. body
in New York on Thursday, when debate is scheduled on the Palestinian
problem. A nearly 1-year-old Palestinian uprising in
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has left at least 316
Palestinians and 11 Israelis dead.
   But the State Department rejected his visa Saturday, and said the
leader of the PLO ``knows of, condones and lends support to''
terrorist attacks.
   Approval to move the U.N. body to Geneva would require a simple
majority of the 159 members. The members have regularly approved
Palestinian-backed resolutions by an overwhelming majority.
   ``I really don't see any problem (of passage) if the resolution
is proposed in a reasonable manner,'' Maksoud said.
   Maksoud said the Arab group probably would call for postponement
of debate on Palestine in the regular session, scheduled to end by
mid-December, and reconvene in December or January in Geneva.
   A source close to the Arab League, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the Arab diplomats will consider a legal challenge
to the U.S. decision when they meet Monday.
   Moving the General Assembly out of New York as a protest would be
unprecedented.
   Earlier this year, Arab and developing nations considered moving
the current session to Geneva when a U.S. attempt to close the PLO's
U.N. observer mission was working its way through U.S. courts.
   In March, the General Assembly voted 148-2 to condemn the U.S.
attempt to evict the PLO Mission by attempting to enforce an
anti-terrorism law. Only Israel joined the United States in voting
against the resolution.
   In June, a U.S. District judge ruled the anti-terrorism law does
not supercede the U.N. Headquarters Agreement, and struck down the
Justice Department's lawsuit, making the issue moot.
   Arafat has not commented on the U.S. decision.

<TEXT>
   A man who sued the heavy-metal rock group Judas
Priest for allegedly prompting his 1985 suicide attempt has slipped
into a coma and is nearly brain dead, his mother said.
   Phyllis Vance said doctors have told her that a preliminary test
shows her son, James Vance, is 99.9 percent brain dead. Brain death
occurs when all functions of the brain cease.
   Mrs. Vance said doctors also told her they were unsure what
caused her son to slip into a coma early Thursday, the day he was
scheduled to leave. Vance, 23, remained in serious condition Sunday
at Washoe Medical Center.
   Vance and his parents are suing the British band for ``subliminal
messages'' they contend caused Vance and Raymond Belknap, 19, to
make a suicide pact.
   The two took a shotgun to a church playground in Sparks, Nev., in
1985 and shot themselves in the head. Belknap died instantly.
   The lawsuit, which was filed by the Vance and Belknap families,
is pending in Washoe District Court. District Judge Jerry Whitehead
last month gave CBS Records 30 days to turn over the master tape of
the group's ``Stained Glass'' album so it can be examined for
subliminal messages.
   CBS has said it cannot find the master tape for the 1978 album.
The judge has said the case would not go to trial without evidence

whether such hidden communications deserve the same constitutional
protection, the judge said.

<HEAD>Nussbaum Ready To Testify Against Joel Steinberg</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The longtime companion of Joel Steinberg said she
won't be intimidated when she testifies against Steinberg this week
at his murder trial for the death of their illegally adopted
daughter, a relative said.
   ```People think when I look at him I'll say that I did it. But
I'm not going to. I'm going to tell the truth,''' said Judy Liebman,
who quoted her sister, Hedda Nussbaum, in an interview published in
Sunday's editions of New York Newsday.
   Steinberg, 47, is charged with second-degree murder and
first-degree manslaughter in the Nov. 5, 1987, death of Lisa
Steinberg.
   Nussbaum has told psychiatrists that Steinberg beat Lisa into
unconsciousness on the afternoon of Nov. 1, 1987, and then went out
to dinner with a friend, sources close to the case have said. She
died four days later.
   Nussbaum was also arrested and charged with murder in the child's
death, but last month prosecutors cleared her of all criminal
responsibility.
   ``Nobody really knows what's going to happen when Hedda confronts
Joel from the witness stand _ whether she'll finally be able to
stand up to him,'' Nussbaum's lawyer, Barry Scheck, told the Daily
News.
   Nussbaum is undergoing psychiatric treatment. Doctors have
permitted her to watch television news accounts and read accounts of
the trial published in The New York Times.
   In one television news account, Steinberg said ``Lisa was my
whole life.'' He added: ``I loved Hedda for many years, and I still
do.''
   ``She knows this was all designed to push all her buttons,''
Scheck told Newsday.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels killed a civilian liaison to
the military, then massacred 20 friends and relatives who went to
search for him, the government said Sunday.
   It said army patrols had found the bodies buried in common
mountain graves in the region west of Guatemala City.
   The victims included at least 12 relatives of Carlos Humberto
Guerra Callejas, a civilian assigned to the military in the village
of El Aguacate, the government said. Aguacate is about 40 miles from
Guatemala City in Chimaltenango province.
   Guerra Callejas disappeared Wednesday, and his friends and
relatives organized a search Friday. The government described the
search party as a group of poor farmers with an evangelical pastor,
Antonio Olivares.
   A few of them said they managed to escape while the other 20 fell
into the hands of guerrillas belonging to the Revolutionary
Organization of the People in Arms, according to the government
statement.
   Troops at a military base in the city of Chimaltenango, about 20
miles west of Guatemala City, also launched a search.
   They found Guerra Callejas' body and fought two skirmishes with
rebels before finding the bodies of the other 20 victims on Saturday
night, the government said. One military officer was reported
wounded in the fighting.
   Civilians who work with the military like Guerra Callejas are
often powerful people in small Guatemalan communities because of
their military connections. They have often been accused of
involvement in human rights abuses.
   The government said the alleged massacre ``reached the limits of
the incredible and shows total contempt for the most elemental
principles of humanity.''
   It gave no details of exactly how it believed the people were
killed or why.
   The dead were identified Sunday by family members who were taken
into the isolated mountains by military patrols.
   The massacre is the largest blamed on the Organization of the
People in Arms. The group and two others make up the leftist
guerrilla resistance in Guatemala.

<TEXT>
   A girl who is at the center of a possible
baby-swap involving two distraught families turns 10 Tuesday, and on
Friday faces a court hearing that may possibly lead to a change of
her identity.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg have asked a Sarasota County judge to
order genetic tests of Kimberly Michelle Mays to determine if she is
their biological daughter. The Twiggs think Kimberly was switched
shortly after birth with Arlena Twigg, the child they reared until
her death in August.
   Genetic tests showed Arlena was not related to either Twigg.
   Robert W. Mays, who raised Kimberly and thinks he is her
biological father, has refused to allow testing.
   Mays wants to know if the Twiggs plan to seek custody before he
even considers testing, while the Twiggs want testing done before
they make that decision. Both issues will be taken up at Friday's
hearing.
   ``Why should we have a fight over custody before we know who
Kimberly is?'' asked the Twiggs' attorney, John Blakely.
   Mays, however, is adamant about his refusal to allow testing.
   ``I don't think I have to prove anything at all,'' Mays said.
``If there's a one-in-a-milion chance it's true, I'm not going to
gamble it on my daughter.''
   The Twiggs filed a $100 million lawsuit in September claiming
employees at Hardee Memorial Hospital in Wauchula had deliberately
switched their baby. Two weeks later, investigators and reporters
had tracked down the only other white girl born at Hardee while
Arlena was there.
   That girl was Kimberly Mays.
   The two families have little in common.
   The Twiggs, who now live in Langhorne, Pa., are a large,
religious family used to financial hardships. Much of their lives
centered on Arlena, who was born with a heart defect.
   Mays, 43, a Sarasota roofing supply salesman, is a single father
with enough time and money to take Kimberly on frequent boating and
skiing trips.
   The Twiggs see themselves as the innocent victims of a horrible
plot. And Mays lives in fear that the same thing will happen to him.
   ``It is the most incredibly horrifying thing that can happen to a
parent,'' said Mays, whose first wife and Kimberly's legal mother,
Barbara, died of cancer in March 1981. Mays later remarried and
divorced.
   ``We've been through death. We've been through divorce. In every
case, we came through together,'' Mays said of Kimberly.
   ``We're totally devastated,'' Mrs. Twigg has said. ``Our lives
have turned into a nightmare. We've not only lost our Arlena, ...
but also, where is our own daughter?''
   Mays describes Kimberly as a good student, a tomboy until
recently when she ``just realized she's a little girl.''
   ``She's a wonderful little girl _ very active in sports,
gymnastics, swimming. She's very outrageous, personable, friendly,
loving. Hey, can you tell this is my kid I'm talking about?'' Mays
said. One of her favorite places, he said, is Vail, Colo., where the
two go skiing.
   The Twiggs, married 21 years, have raised a large family on
strict Christian values and limited money. She is a former teacher
and he is an Amtrak clerk. Their seven surviving children range in
age from 5 to 19.

<HEAD>Killer Whale Born In Captivity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first killer whale born in
captivity in Canada got a resounding welcome from the public, but an
expert says it would have been better if the calf had been born free.
   ``It's a pretty shallow existence,'' said Paul Spong, an
internationally recognized whale expert and one of the leaders of an
international campaign against whaling in the 1970s.
   He said he hoped the 2-week-old celebrity at the Vancouver Public
Aquarium would be freed one day.
   ``From an outward perspective they can make a good case for
saying: `We're feeding them well, they're surviving, they're _ as
far as we can tell _ happy,''' he said.
   But Spong, who runs a privately funded whale-research station on
Hanson Island off Vancouver Island, maintains that captive whales
suffer, both socially and physically.
   In the wild, whales travel in pods, kinship groups of 15 or 20,
at speeds of at least 30 mph, he said. Their primary sense is sonar
hearing, and a concrete pool surrounds it with an ``acoustic fuzz,''
causing stress.
   Aquarium spokesman Stefani Hewlett said a captive life is not
necessarily worse than one in the wild.
   ``There will always be that bunch out there that refuses to
believe that an animal can be thriving and comfortable and normal in
a situation other than the wild,'' she said, adding that a large
number of whale calves do not survive in the wild.
   In captivity, Hewlett said whales ``use their sounds and their
bodies and all their other senses and there's no indication they
aren't healthy and thriving and normal.''
   Whale advocates in the United States have long fought against
confining the huge mammals to perform money-making stunts. Whale
handlers say the shows provide educational and research benefits.
   The issue was renewed after orca whales at San Diego's Sea World
turned on their handlers in March and November 1987, seriously
injuring two.
   Critics charged that too much pressure was placed on the whales
and on inexperienced trainers. Sea World president Robert Gault said
at the time that the importance of entertainment was overemphasized
and that ``we've taken a step back to re-evaluate our safety and
training.''
   Sea World, a profitable, privately run U.S. marine park, has had
two killer whales born in captivity. The Texas Sea World announced
Friday the birth of a 300-pound calf. Another baby whale born at Sea
World died of a heart defect after 11 days.
   Aquariums have been exhibiting killer whales since the late 1960s.

<HEAD>Soviets Split On Marriage Move</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALONICA, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet chess players are split over the
swift move by one of their top woman players and the captain of the
U.S. chess team, who tied the knot and walked out of a major
tournament.
   Elena Akhmilovskaya was the second-ranked player on the Soviet
women's team. On Friday, she secretly married John Donaldson, a
31-year-old International master from Seattle. Donaldson served as a
non-playing captain for the U.S. team.
   The couple left Greece on Saturday as news of their marriage
leaked out.
   World champion Garri Kasparov dismissed the much-publicized love
match Sunday as a ``private matter.
   ``You can do what you like,'' Kasparov, 25, told reporters at the
Chess Olympiad, a team tournament.
   But another member of the Soviet delegation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, suggested Ms. Akhmilovskaya's sudden flight
from Greece at a crucial stage of the championship was ``against her
team.''
   ``If she had waited,'' the Soviet said, ``she could have had a
big wedding here at the end.''
   Most Soviets, however, either refused to comment or seemed
uninformed about the details of the incident when they were
questioned during the weekend.
   Donaldson and Ms. Akhmilovskaya met during a competition in
Havana, Cuba, in 1985.
   They both attended a U.S.-Soviet friendship party on Wednesday
night. A photograph of the gathering even appeared in the official
Olympiad bulletin distributed to players the morning of the wedding.
   ``This wedding is the first consequence of the U.S.-Soviet
friendship party,'' said Leontxo Garcia, a Spanish chess commentator.
   The early departure of Ms. Akhmilovskaya has forced the three
other Soviet women to play in all the remaining rounds.
   Although the Soviets have dominated women's chess with 10
Olympiad victories in 11 competitions, their stranglehold is
threatened by a trio of Hungarian sisters. Among them is Judit
Polgar, the highest ranked 12-year-old in history.
   With one round remaining, the two teams are tied for first with
the winner to be decided in Tuesday's final round.
   While the Soviets are virtually guaranteed the gold medals in the
men's championship, the U.S. men's team was still battling in joint
third place, a point behind England and tied with the Netherlands.
The U.S. men took the bronze medals in the last three biennial
Olympiads.

   A New Zealand tourist died Monday of injuries she
suffered after two lovers climbed a tower at the Great Wall and
killed themselves with a homemade bomb in an apparent suicide pact.
   The New Zealander, 34-year-old Colleena Wong of Auckland, died at
Beijing's Tiantan Hospital without regaining consciousness, said an
embassy official on condition of anonymity. She had undergone a
six-hour operation.
   The tourist suffered head injuries one week earlier when a couple
from northeast China, each married to another person, set off the
explosion on one of the high towers of the Great Wall at Badaling.
The area about 40 miles northwest of Beijing is popular with
tourists.
   The 33-year-old man and 29-year-old woman from Jilin province
were seen hugging just before the blast, police said. They said the
couple, who were killed instantly, apparently set off the blast out
of desperation over their love affair.

   An Arabian horse named Reine fell
into a septic tank and was trapped in 5 feet of muck for two hours
before she was freed by rescue crews.
   ``I thought we were going to have to shoot her,'' said Reine's
owner, Suzanne Chase. ``It's amazing she didn't break a leg.''
   Capt. Dave Tibbets of the Castro Valley Fire Department said that
when the horse's foreleg sank into the muck on Saturday, the
11-year-old mare panicked and fell in even deeper _ down about 5
feet.
   ``She kept struggling to get out. I held her head up so she
wouldn't drown,'' Chase said.
   Four firefighters, a backhoe operator and workers from the
Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals managed to finally free
Reine. It took Chase and 10 volunteers clean the horse.
   ``She was trembling so bad and just covered with black stuff,''
Chase said. ``She was just covered from head to foot with sewage.
I'm just happy this story has a happy ending.''

<HEAD>Black and Jewish Veterans of Civil Rights Struggle Plan Reunion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blacks and Jews who worked together in the civil
rights movement plan a two-day reunion to emphasize their historical
bonds and shared martyrs, rather than the recent political pressures
that have strained their relationship.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has been at the center of concerns
about black-Jewish relations since he was accused of making
anti-Semitic remarks during his 1984 presidential campaign, was
invited to the conference but was not among those who had confirmed
plans to attend, said an organizer, Philip Shandler.
   ``It's not about the current political situation,'' Shandler
said. ``It's focusing on the longstanding, productive relationship
between blacks and Jews. It is essentially a history-gathering
conference.''
   Scheduled speakers include Benjamin Hooks, executive director of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and
Al Vorspan, vice president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations.
   The conference, which begins Monday, will focus on recording the
memories of civil rights veterans while also honoring the movement's
martyrs.
   A memorial service was planned Monday night at the Martin Luther
King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change. King's widow, Coretta
Scott King, was to participate in the conference, along with Carolyn
Goodman, the mother of Andrew Goodman; and Ben Chaney, a brother of
James Chaney.
   Chaney, a black man from Meridian, Miss., and Goodman and Michael
Schwerner, white Jews from New York, were killed in 1964 as they
tried to investigate a church burning in Mississippi.
   Their slayings were described as ``the touchstone of black-Jewish
cooperation in the civil rights movement'' by Jonathan Kaufman, also
a conference participant, in his book, ``Broken Alliance: The
Turbulent Times Between Blacks and Jews in America.'' Kaufman is a
reporter with The Boston Globe.
   Shandler, a former columnist for the defunct Washington Star and
a one-time Senate press secretary, and Leon Dash, a black writer for
The Washington Post, plan to use the material they gather at the
conference in a future book on the history of black-Jewish
cooperation.
   The sessions, involving key figures of the time along with
historians and writers, will take place at the Carter Presidential
Center.

   The United States was hit by a flood of worldwide
criticism on Sunday for refusing to allow PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
to address the United Nations.
   France, Norway, China and Sweden urged the United States to
reconsider the decision to deny Arafat a visa, while Italy summoned
a senior American diplomat and demanded an explanation.
   Jordan announced Sunday that it will work with Egypt to move this
week's General Assembly session out of New York because of the U.S.
action to bar Arafat's entry.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz said Saturday that Arafat
would not be allowed to attend this week's U.N. debate on the
Palestinian issue because of evidence that Palestine Liberation
Organization elements ``have engaged in terrorism against Americans
and others.''
   In Kuwait, Arafat's chief deputy, Salah Khalaf, told The
Associated Press: ``The Shultz statement ... is tantamount to an
open call for extremism.''
   He said that if the United States continued to ignore Palestinian
rights, the PLO might reconsider its recent moderate stands.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said the decision
violates the agreement under which New York serves as the U.N.
headquarters.
   ``If maintained, this action is likely to complicate and render
more difficult the further debates on the question of Palestine and
the situation in the Middle East in the current session of the
General Assembly,'' he said through his spokesman, Francois Giuliani.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency said the U.S. refusal ``once
again reveals the lack of political will on the part of the United
States to seek a peaceful settlement of the Middle East issue.''
   The Italian Foreign Ministry expressed its ``astonishment'' at
the decision, and said in a statement that John Holmes, the deputy
chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, was called in to the
ministry Sunday and asked to explain the decision.
   The French Foreign Ministry, in a statement, also criticized the
decision. It said it considered the actions of the Palestine
National Council earlier this month in Algiers ``very positive'' and
worth encouraging.
   The council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile, announced its
acceptance of a U.N. resolution that guarantees all states in the
Middle East the right to exist in peace, thus implicitly recognizing
Israel. It also voted to restrict guerrilla activity.
   The council also declared an independent state with Jerusalem as
its capital. Arafat was expected to ask the General Assembly for
recognition of the state.
   Swedish Foreign Minister Sten Andersson called the visa rejection
``unwise, unreasonable and untimely.''
   ``It's not reasonable that the U.S decides who may appear at the
United Nations,'' Andersson said in a statement.
   President Reagan on Sunday defended the decision.
   ``I think the other way would have sent out the wrong signal _
that we are patsies,'' Reagan said in Santa Barbara, Calif.
   In Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir praised the U.S.
decision, saying it would help thwart a PLO diplomatic campaign for
recognition of the Palestinian state.
   ``This move will deprive Mr. Arafat and the PLO of the
possibility of culminating their propaganda drive following the
Algiers conference,'' said Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner.
   Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg said on national
television that his government had protested the U.S. decision. The
national NTB news agency quoted him as saying: ``It is not
satisfactory that the visa policy of the United States decides who
shall come to the world organization.''
   In Vatican City, Pope John Paul II made an apparent reference to
Arafat's visa application by saying on Sunday that ``every positive
and constructive gesture'' in the Arab-Israel conflict deserves a
corresponding response.
   ``The road of dialogue in the search for peace is certainly
arduous and difficult, but every obstacle that is removed should be
considered ... worthy of inspiring other corresponding gestures,''
he said.

   The director-general of the foreign ministry
flew to Moscow on Sunday, becoming the highest-ranking Israeli to
visit the Soviet Union since the Kremlin cut ties in 1967.
   Avraham Tamir, who had no scheduled meetings with Soviet leaders,
is expected to spend 36 hours in Moscow consulting Israel's consular
delegation there, Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said.
   Tamir decided to make the Moscow stopover during a European tour
after ``reaching the conclusion that there is a need to examine the
consular delegation's work conditions and procedures,'' Liel said.
   Liel said Tamir ``will examine the functioning and work
conditions'' of the five-member delegation which Israel sent to
Moscow last July. He declined to elaborate.
   The Israeli mission in Moscow, located in the embassy of The
Netherlands, has officially been limited to looking after the closed
Israeli embassy building and processing visas for emigrants and
visitors.
   The Israelis went to the Soviet Union a year after the Soviets
broke the diplomatic ice by sending a consular delegation to Tel
Aviv. The Soviet mission has been handling matters relating to
Soviet property, visas and passports from offices in the Finnish
Embassy.
   The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle
East War, when Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem, the
Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from Jordan, Egypt and Syria.

   Nearly 250 residents who were evacuated
when a train derailed and spilled more than 20,000 gallons of
ammonia returned to their homes on Sunday.
   The 89-car train derailed during a heavy thunderstorm Friday
night, and authorities have determined it was hit in two places by a
tornado, said John Bromley, a Union Pacific spokesman.
   The evacuation order was lifted about 11:20 p.m. Saturday, but
most residents did not return until Sunday morning, said Bruce
Messer of the Tyler Fire Department Hazardous Materials Response
team.
   Union Pacific reopened the track Sunday and cleared away some of
the 35 derailed cars.
   ``I suspect it will take us several days to get things tidied
up,'' Bromley said. ``We had one portion of the train that we had
severe damage, then a second part where it was derailed but not very
seriously damaged, then a third part with very severe damage again.''
   He said a damage estimate would take several days to complete.
   Three cars on the train, which was bound for Fort Worth, Texas,
from New Orleans, were carrying hazardous materials and one of them
leaked anhydrous ammonia, a poisonous substance used as fertilizer.

   The Israelis went to the Soviet Union a year after the Soviets
broke the diplomatic ice by sending a consular delegation to Tel
Aviv. The Soviet mission has been handling matters relating to
Soviet property, visas and passports from offices in the Finnish
Embassy.
   The Soviet Union broke ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle
East War, when Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem, the
Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights from Jordan, Egypt and Syria.

   A small airplane crashed into a swamp during
a thunderstorm Sunday, killing all four people aboard, authorities
said.
   In Port Lavaca, Texas, a single-engine airplane crashed into a
house during a heavy fog, killing the pilot and injuring the
passenger. Those in the house escaped injury.
   Florida rescue crews were searching for a second aircraft after
eyewitnesses reported different locations for the crash site,
suggesting the possibility of a collision, officials said.
   ``They're just checking to make sure there wasn't more than one
plane,'' said Robert Bullard, an Escambia County emergency medical
technician who was the first to arrive at the crash site.
   The single-engine Piper Cherokee had taken off near Tampa Bay,
Fla, and was bound for Mobile, Ala., said Jack Barker, regional
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   Two men and two women were killed by the impact of the crash
about 20 miles north of Pensacola, Bullard said. The plane
apparently lost its wings during a thunderstorm and its nose hit
first, he said.
   The airplane, which was passing over Pensacola, had been in
routine contact with the control tower before the crash, Barker said.
   ``Then at 12:35 Central time they lost contact with the plane 10
miles north-northwest of Pensacola, near Molino,'' Barker said.
   The plane went down in a swampy area near this Florida panhandle
town, hindering recovery efforts, said Escambia County Sheriff's
Department spokesman John Harper.
   Rescuers had to travel by boat part of the route and took over
two hours to reach the site, he said.
   The victims' names were not immediately available, Barker said.
   Port Lavaca Police Chief Joe Pena said Basil Blevins and his wife
were watching television in the den of their home about 11:30 p.m.
Saturday when the two-seater plane plowed into the master bedroom.
   The pilot, Allen Abildstrom of Houston, 32, was killed. Passenger
Gregory Hicks, 22, of Houston, was transported in satisfactory
condition to Sharpstown Hospital, where he was being treated for eye
injuries, authorities said.
   The plane was removed from the house early Sunday.
   ``I didn't feel a thing,'' Blevins said of the crash. ``It got
the front bedroom, the hallway, the bathroom, the closet and then
the master bedroom.''
   ``They lucked out,'' Pena said of the couple. ``They were in the
den area when it crashed. It came through the roof and the engine
was lodged into a closet and bathroom of the master bedroom.''

   Government troops in helicopters and
airplanes swooped down on two leftist rebel bases over the weekend
in separate assaults that killed 27 guerrillas and three soldiers,
the military said Sunday.
   It described the attacks as the largest this year. They followed
President Virgilio Barco's announcement Friday of emergency measures
to fight leftist rebels, right-wing paramilitary groups and drug
traffickers.
   Airborne soldiers landed at an Amazon jungle camp on Sunday,
killing six rebels in the April 19 Movement, also known as M-19,
according to military sources speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They said two soldiers also died in the assault on the base in
Caqueta department about 250 miles south of Bogota.
   In a similar attack Saturday, 21 guerrillas and one soldier died
in a battle between troops and about 80 rebels, according to Gen.
Rafael Padilla Vergara, commander of the army's Second Division. He
said the other guerrillas escaped.
   Padilla said the army attacked after discovering a Colombian
Revolutionary Armed Forces base in the Sierra de la Mararena region
in the remote eastern plains, about 150 miles east of Bogota.
   He said troops there also uncovered a clandestine landing strip
and coca plants, a sign the guerrillas and cocaine traffickers who
make the drug from coac plants were working together. The general
added that soldiers were combing the region on Sunday in search of
more rebels and drug traffickers.
   About 10,000 people belong to six major Colombian rebel groups,
which have been growing rapidly in recent years. They are blamed for
more than 2,000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings this year alone.
   Barco, a civilian president, promised in Friday's moves to
increase the security forces and stiffen penalties for
terrorist-related killings.

<TEXT>
   Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, a
former foreign minister, claimed victory Sunday in the presidential
primary of his United Social Christian Party.
   His main opponent, economist Miguel Angel Rodriguez, conceded
defeat in a televised statement.
   The party's electoral court said early returns showed Calderon
Fournier had 109,600 votes to 26,000 for Rodriguez. Jose Hine
Garcia, a farmer, received 283 votes, it said.
   An estimated 415,000 people voted, the court said. The election
was open to all registered voters.
   Speaking at party headquarters, Calderon Fournier, a 39-year-old
lawyer, accused President Oscar Arias of letting the country of 2.5
million slide into an economic crisis.
   He ran on a platform of reviving the economy and attacking
corruption, which he said ``has become institutionalized in Costa
Rica.''
   The son of former President Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia, he has
run twice for president. In 1982 he lost to Luis Alberto Monge and
in 1986 to Arias.
   Both Monge and Arias are from the National Liberation Party,
which has not yet named its candidate for the elections scheduled
for Feb. 19, 1990.
   Calderon Fournier was a congressman from 1974 to 1978 and foreign
minister from 1978 to 1980. Since then, he has devoted his time to
politics and his law practice.
   Costa Rica, a peaceful, longtime democracy in the turbulent
Central American isthmus, has had only two presidents in the past
100 years who were not elected.

   Mayor W. Wilson Goode has vowed to ``bring
the economic wheels to a halt in this city'' and close city-funded
agencies unless barriers that exclude blacks and women are removed.
   ``What I want to do by the time I leave office is remove all
those signs that say, `For White Males Only' in this city,'' Goode
said in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer published
Sunday. ``For too long, this city has been a closed club. White
women, minority women and minority men have been excluded from the
club.''
   Goode's recent efforts to increase the share of minority-owned
companies in city contracts has drawn criticism from some who
contend he is pursuing a social goal while ignoring the principles
of competitive bidding and the impact on the city's taxpayers.
   Goode, with three years left in his second term, responded by
saying he was responsible for helping reverse what he described as a
pattern of discrimination that has gone unchecked in prior
administrations.
   Goode, the city's first black mayor, said he intended to pursue
his goal ``with a lot of aggressiveness.''
   In 1982, the city council overrode a veto by then-mayor William
Green and set goals of 15 percent of city contracts for
minority-owned firms and 10 percent for companies owned by women.
   This year, the mayor has reset the guidelines on two projects,
raising the minority requirements to 35 percent on a $26 million
contract and to 30 percent on a $90 million contract. The first
contract was never awarded because of financial and legal problems
at one of the firms; the second was awarded, but the cost has risen
by $17 million over the city's initial projection.
   Goode said he had privately pushed for change since 1984, the
year after he was elected, but said he was speaking out now because
he had met resistance.
   In August, Goode declared that all agencies that receive city
funding would have to comply with the city policy.
   ``If it means stopping the operation of some of these agencies
for six months, we will stop the operations for six months,'' Goode
said.
   Some city and state legislators have sued the city, contending
taxpayers were being robbed of the savings that come from fully
competitive bidding.
   ``If you can arbitrarily change the guidelines, you can dictate
who the bidder is going to be and defeat the whole notion of
competitive bidding,'' said Hugh Bracken, the attorney representing
the legislators. He said the situation creates ``a real possibility
of abuse.''
   White contractors also have complained they are being forced to
pair up with minority firms without knowing how they perform.

   Trenna Klee's first exposure to indoor dirt
bicycle racing was when she went to see her 10-year-old son compete.
Now she is out on the track, racing against girls not much older
than her son.
   Mrs. Klee, 35, entered her first national competition at the
American Bicycle Association's BMX Grand Nationals in Oklahoma City
over the weekend. The competition featured racers ranging in age
from 5 to the 50s, but those were the men.
   The oldest female racer besides Mrs. Klee was 17.
   The Wichita, Kan., mother competes in the 13 and over girls'
cruiser class.
   ``The girls are real sweet to me, but not patronizing. They seem
really excited that a mom would be racing in it,'' Mrs. Klee said.
   She entered three girls' motos, or rounds, but didn't win a race
to qualify for the quarterfinals. But she said she got some valuable
racing experience.
   ``I fell in the first moto, coming over the first big jump. It is
big, and it is scary,'' she said. ``I've never fallen. This was a
first, and I did not like it.''
   The racers, wearing helmets and heavy-duty garb, go around an
indoor track that includes hills ``higher than I am tall,'' said the
5-foot-3-inch Mrs. Klee. She races in a borrowed uniform that her
neighbor's son outgrew.
   Mrs. Klee says she's not sure how her son feels about her taking
up racing after he gave it up for computers, but she says her
husband is thrilled.
   ``He says one way or another he's going to get a racer out of
this family,'' Mrs. Klee said.
   Mrs. Klee began racing in September.
   ``The first couple of times around the track, I thought I was
going to die,'' she said. ``I said, `What have I gotten myself
into?' But if you can ride a bike, you can do this.
   She says she plans to be back at the national competition next
year, but she hopes by then to be able to interest enough women _
she needs at least four _ to have a separate women's class.
   ``It's certainly a lot more fair to race someone in their 30s,''
she said.

   Lou Kahns can't forget the sound of
footsteps that night a decade ago when 40,000 people marched to City
Hall to mourn the deaths of the mayor and a popular gay city
supervisor.
   ``It was soothing, measured, very powerful, the most beautiful
sound I have ever heard in my life,'' said the 32-year-old financial
consultant.
   ``No one spoke at all. Not even a whisper,'' he said. ``In
everybody's hand was a candle. The streets glistened and the sky
seemed darker than I can ever remember. We all held hands or hugged
each other because we all felt so terribly alone and terribly,
terribly hurt.''
   On Nov. 27, 1978, former city supervisor Dan White crawled
through a basement window at City Hall and shot to death populist
Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the nation's first
openly gay elected city official.
   Led by a doleful drum beat, 10,000 people recreated a decade-old
march of mourning on Sunday night.
   ``They spoke up for us back then, and now we're showing up for
them,'' said Stephen Wickes, 36, as the crowd began its 1{-mile trek
from the largely homosexual Castro district to City Hall.
   Folksinger Joan Baez, who had stood on the steps of City Hall the
night Moscone and Milk were killed and led 40,000 grieving people in
a tearful version of ``Amazing Grace,'' joined relatives, friends
and a host of local and state politicians at the Civic Center Plaza
for a tribute.
   One group carried a banner reading, ``We remember Harvey and
George.'' Dozens of people lined the sidewalks, some of them in
tears, many of them joining in on the spur of the moment after
marchers passed.
   The killings occurred as Moscone, pressured by Milk and his newly
formed gay political machine, was a half-hour away from announcing
he would not reappoint White to the seat on the Board of Supervisors
from which White had impetuously resigned 17 days before.
   By appointing a liberal neighborhood activist instead, Moscone
could create the first liberal majority on the 11-member commission.
   But when Moscone broke the news to the former policeman, White
pulled out a revolver and shot the 49-year-old mayor four times.
   White then walked down the hall, reloaded the gun, and asked
Milk, 48, a former Wall Street analyst, to step into White's old
office, where he emptied the gun into Milk.
   ``As San Franciscans we remember them as politicians of course,
but more importantly as people who embodied that very special thing
we consider the spirit of San Francisco,'' said Cleve Jones, a gay
activist and former aide to current Mayor Art Agnos. ``They were
intensely likeable men who in retrospect we always remember smiling,
we remember them laughing.''
   Following by nine days the horror of the deaths of more than 900
members of San Francisco-based Peoples Temple in the jungle of
Guyana, the killings plunged the city into what writer Warren
Hinckle dubbed the ``night of dark intent.''
   Despite the bizarre nature of those events, nothing prepared the
city for the voluntary manslaughter verdict White received six
months later. It provoked a riot by 5,000 people who stormed City
Hall, burning police cars and hurling bricks through windows to
protest what they saw as leniency.
   The prosecutor had sought first-degree murder convictions, but
defense lawyers, in what came to be called the ``Twinkie'' defense,
convinced jurors that White suffered from diminished mental
capacity, partially caused by his ingestion of junk food.
   White, whose campaign literature said he would not ``be forced
out of San Francisco by splinter groups of radicals, social deviates
and incorrigibles,'' served only five years of his 7-year,
eight-month sentence. He committed suicide by carbon monoxide
poisoning in his garage on Oct. 21, 1985, 19 months after getting
out of prison.
   San Francisco's homosexual community has elevated Milk to the
status of a martyr, often viewing his death as the result of an
unspoken conspiracy of intolerance.
   California's left-liberal political machine, long centered in San
Francisco, has equally touted the memory of Moscone.
   ``George was unique because he wanted to bring about in San
Francisco a political situation where all people had input,'' said
former Police Chief Charles Gain, who resigned a year after the
killings.

   A new OPEC accord to limit production
appeared to be unraveling Sunday after Saudi Arabia pressed for a
$15-a-barrel benchmark price, three dollars less than the cartel's
official level, officials said.
   ``Iran is not going to accept this type of idea,'' said Feredoon
Barkeshli, a senior Iranian delegate to the winter conference of the
13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The proposal, he said, ``can totally sabotage the agreement.''
   He said Algeria, Nigeria and Libya also opposed changing the $18
benchmark. Barkeshli said he met for two hours Sunday with OPEC
President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, but said afterward: ``I am very
pessimistic.''
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said the proposed $15
benchmark was intended to prevent further price erosion.
   ``What we wanted is even to eliminate a reference to the $18,
just in case under the best of circumstances ... the price might
even go beyond $18,'' he told reporters late Sunday.
   Nazer insisted he would not back down from his stand.
   Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, announced in Tehran
earlier Sunday that he would accept the deal to cut the cartel's
output and drive up prices.
   But Barkeshli said Aghazadeh agreed to a preliminary draft that
would retain OPEC's $18 benchmark.
   The announcement last week that the ministers tentatively reached
a new output pact sent prices higher. Brent North Sea crude rose
$1.65 a barrel to close Friday at $14.42.
   Prices have been running $4 or more below the $18 target due to a
world oil glut.
   Each $1 rise in the price of crude oil theoretically means an
increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although
oil companies do not always pass along the full increase.
   The agreement, which would set member quotas, would cut OPEC
production from the current estimated 22.5 million barrels a day to
18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of next year.
   Barkeshli told reporters that Saudi Arabia made two proposals
Sunday morning.
   The Iranian delegate said one would set a target price at $15 a
barrel and the other would set a price band ranging from $15 to $18.
This, he said, ``is a major divergence from OPEC resolutions so
far.''
   ``We're not going to concede to any new elements whatsoever,'' he
said.
   Barkeshli said the plan worked out with Aghazadeh ``did not have
anything like $15'' and that the Iranian Cabinet approved the
original draft with the $18 reference price.
   Aghazadeh left Vienna Friday to try to sell the package to his
government. Barkeshli said Aghazadeh will not return to Vienna.
   The OPEC ministers had been scheduled to resume formal
discussions Sunday, but they were postponed until Monday.
   The price issue in the accord, which would replace one arranged
in 1986, is critical. Many OPEC countries need as much money as
possible from their oil sales.
   Iran and Iraq want additional revenues to rebuild their
economies, which were badly damaged in their 8-year-old war. They
agreed to an August cease-fire.
   Under the new agreement, Iran and Iraq would each get the same
quota of 2.64 million barrels a day.
   The issue of parity had been a sticking point in discussions of
the cartel's winter meeting, which began Nov. 21. Iraq has been
demanding an equal production ceiling with Iran. Aghazadeh had
repeatedly said no.
   Saudi Arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter of
the cartel's total output.
   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,
and Venezuela.

   Residents are complaining that the
cleanup of chemicals like nerve gas and mustard gas from a federal
Superfund site is giving them headaches, runny eyes, respiratory
problems and nausea.
   The cleanup began in July at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, part of
which was used from 1957 to 1980 as a reservoir for the Army's
chemical weapons program and Shell Oil Co.'s pesticide-manufacturing
operation.
   During the cleanup process, gases are being released from the
contaminated soil. Easterly winds carry the gases over Irondale,
which just north of Commerce City and about 10 miles northeast of
Denver.
   Residents say the fumes from the cleanup on some days hang over
Commerce City like a fog.
   Mary Daigle, a resident of the Irondale mobile home park, says
long-term effects on her health are unknown.
   ``I am glad they are cleaning it (the arsenal) up,'' Daigle said.
``But I don't think the people that live around it should pay for it
with their health.''
   The nearly 45 families living in the mobile home park are about a
mile west of Basin F in the arsenal's northwest corner. The cleanup
is centered in Basin F.
   ``It's a terrible odor,'' said Irondale resident Erwin Rice, who
has lived there since 1980. ``It smells more like insecticide.''
   Rice said his father, who had lived in the mobile home since
1974, died of cancer in 1983.
   Colorado Department of Health officials will begin visiting
arsenal neighbors to try to track the effects of airborne pollution.
   Connally Mears, the Environmental Protection Agency's coordinator
for the arsenal cleanup, said residents will be asked about their
health backgrounds and about their exposure to any other hazardous
substances, including tobacco.
   Nurses are expected to survey 30 to 40 families. The results will
be sent to the Rocky Mountain Poison Center for analysis.
   The situation also has drawn the attention of the national
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which will try to determine
potential health risks posed by the estimated 20 chemicals in Basin
F.

   John Sununu remains on the faculty of Tufts
University six years after he last taught there, an arrangement that
has allowed his children to receive tuition waivers and aid from the
school.
   The New Hampshire governor, who is President-elect George Bush's
choice as White House chief of staff, has had two children enrolled
in Tufts since he left the university and also has children
attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Mass., and Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
   The children attending Tufts are granted full tuition waivers and
those at other colleges receive tuition subsidies from Tufts as part
of faculty benefits Sununu has received during his six years on
leave from the school, according to Tufts officials. Tuition at
Tufts in the 1987-88 school year was $11,750.
   An official who oversees faculty benefits at Tufts described
Sununu's arrangement as ``extremely rare,'' and said general school
policy is to grant leaves for up to two years.

<TEXT>
   The frontrunner in Venezuela's Dec. 4
presidential race will call for a rescheduling of the nation's $20.4
billion public foreign debt if elected, a source close to the
candidate said Sunday.
   Social Democrat Carlos Andres Perez, who was Venezuela's
president between 1974 and 1979 and is campaigning for a second
term, ``will necessarily have to call for new negotiations'' with
creditor banks, said senator Carlos Canache Mata, one of Perez's
closest aides.
   Perez consistently has led opinion polls since the campaign began
last May.
   The nation's new president will take over Feb. 3, nearly a year
after Venezuela signed a second public debt repayment accord
involving 461 creditor banks, mostly from the United States.
   Canache, who is one of the top leaders of the government Social
Democratic party Accion Democratica, said the current 14-year
repayment period, which extends through the end of this century,
should go well into the next century.
   Payments, he said in a Sunday interview with the newspaper El
Nacional, should be stretched out over a period of 25 to 30 years,
plus a three-year grace period.
   Perez himself has said repeatedly that under the current
conditions Venezuela cannot pay its debt. Canache's remarks
apparently signaled for the first time the candidate's desire for
the extension of the repayment period and the for a yet-undisclosed
fixed interest rate he would request from creditors.
   Perez' main contender, Social Christian Eduardo Fernandez, of the
COPEI party, also has said the current agreement should be improved,
but has offered no details on his plans.
   This year, Venezuela paid about $5 billion to service its public
and private sector debts, which total about $33 billion. Venezuela
is Latin America's fourth largest debtor, after Brazil, Mexico and
Argentina.
   Canache said that because of the lack of new loans from private
banks, Venezuela ``is in no capacity to pay for November
installments.'' He would not mention any figure.
   Growing imports and debt service have created a balance of
payments gap of $3 billion this year.
   The outgoing Social Democratic government of president Jaime
Lusinchi is attempting to obtain $1 billion in December by selling
seven years' worth of receivables of its oil exports.
   Canache did not say whether the inability to pay November
installments would be carried over in December.
   The government has said consistently it intends to abide by the
current accord and leave to the incoming administration the decision
on whether to call for new debt negotiations.
   Canache suggested that before requesting new terms Perez would
begin talks with other Latin American debtors such as Brazil, Mexico
and Argentina. Perez would simultaneously try to involve creditor
countries, especially the United States, Japan and European nations,
in negotiations with private banks and multilateral financial
organizations.

   The pressure to force George Bush to renege on
his promise not to raise taxes began months ago, but it turned
fierce within hours of his election as president. He must go back on
his word, they said.
   ``They'' can be just about anyone, so diverse is the ``they''
group. It includes financial leaders and labor leaders, tight-fisted
Republicans and liberal Democrats, conservative and ultraliberal
economists.
   So uniform is the cry it would seem to leave Bush with no
options, but it isn't so. He has several of them.
   Most cynical of them is to give in and then blame Congress, to
fight a battle worthy of his promise knowing that in the end he will
submit and, while still denouncing higher taxes, allow them to be
imposed.
   Another is only slightly less cynical, but it has been used over
and over in recent years. It is a creative technique, an art that
raises taxes without ever using the word ``tax,'' relying instead on
a string of elusive euphemisms.
   Why bring up the nasty ``T'' word when user fees, revenue
enhancers, earmarking, mandated benefits, education premiums and
other non-tax taxes have already been imposed and can be reused and
extended?
   Revenue enhancers, for example, raise funds without any
legislation or attendant controversy. Laws already on the books
simply are employed more intensively. Congress is not involved;
controversy is kept to a minimum.
   Revenue enhancing at the Internal Revenue Service, for instance,
means tightening procedures, hiring more auditors, scrutinizing
returns, challenging taxpayers and carrying more disputes to court.
   Aside from these two procedures, however, the Bush team has still
another option, and that is to hold firm.
   Such a stand would seem to require fortifying the White House and
building a moat around it, because the tax increase crowd is armed
for the battle with statistics, moral preaching and a near consensus
of economic thinking.
   Any economic consensus is a frightening thing, seeking to trample
and ridicule other notions. Uncertain, mercurial, changeable most of
the time, economists in consensus constitute a rigid, self-righteous
intellectual bloc.
   But there is another side to the budget deficit controversy, and
it is likely to emerge more forcefully over the next few weeks in
response to the onslaught from advocates of a tax increase.
   Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based
conservative think tank that has been highly influential in the
Reagan administration, has challenged the consensus.
   Moore maintains that the deficit already is being reduced by
economic growth, and that if Congress holds spending to a rate of
less than 4 percent a year the entire deficit will be eliminated in
1993 _ without any new taxes.
   ``The facts are on Bush's side,'' says Moore. ``There is no
reason for him to retreat from his pledge.''
   Paul Craig Roberts, former White House adviser and now with
Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International
Studies, also contends the deficit already is being overcome.
   In a column for Business Week magazine, Roberts says Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and others who claim we cannot
outgrow the deficit ``are in obvious contradiction to the fact that
we have been doing precisely that.''
   He also cites the view of Robert Eisner, a professor at
Northwestern University and president of the American Economic
Association, that the budget deficit might even be a product of
incorrect measurements.
   It is conceivable, in fact, that once the Bush team marshals its
economic arguments it might not even have to consider any option but
that of standing firm.
