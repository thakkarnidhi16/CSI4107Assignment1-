   Both loops of the Capital Beltway around
Washington were closed for more than four hours, 160 homes were
evacuated and nine firefighters were injured when a truck carrying
a volatile chemical overturned and caught fire during Friday's rush
hour.
   The truck, carrying 11,000 lbs. of granular potassium
permanganate, caught fire at 3:20 p.m., according to Fairfax County
Fire Department spokeswoman Pam Weiger.
   The chemical is a respiratory irritant and can cause skin burns.
   Four of 175 containers were broken open, and firefighters kept
water flowing over the smouldering crystals to keep fumes from
spreading until clean-up crews could clear the scene, Weiger said.
   At the height of the fire, yellow smoke shot 150 feet into the
air.
   Traffic was backed up for miles while authorities from a number
of jurisdictions tried to reroute traffic. The inner loop was
reopened about 7 p.m., but two lanes of the outer loop were not
opened again until 9:30 p.m.
   Four firefighters were hospitalized with breathing difficulties
from the chemical fumes, Weiger said.
   Five people from the Fairfax hazardous materials unit were
treated at Fairfax Hospital for heat exhaustion caused by being
encapsulated in suits for several hours, she said.

   Firefighters on Friday hoisted to safety a
66-year-old man who fell 35 feet down a private well and a
16-year-old grandson who tried unsuccessfully to rescue him,
authorities said.
   Duane Nelson, a retired physician, had donned rigging to descend
into the well on his property to clean sand that had accumulated at
the bottom. He either fell or lost consciousness, ending up at the
bottom of the well, authorities said.
   His grandson, Kevin Stillwell, of Mesa, Ariz., went down to
help, but his rigging attachment apparently broke, said Rick
Oliver, firefighter-paramedic for Spokane County Fire Protection
District 9.
   Stillwell also lost consciousness, apparently from lack of
oxygen, and fell atop his grandfather, Oliver said. Both were
trapped in the well for about an hour.
   Nelson, whose property is in Greenbluff, north of Spokane, was
airlifted to Sacred Heart Medical Center here, where he was in
critical condition Friday evening with multiple injuries, a nursing
supervisor said. Stillwell was treated and released at another
Hospital.
   Rescue workers had difficulty lowering themselves into the well
because of their bulky protective clothing and the narrow shaft
opening, authorities said.
   Oliver said he then was lowered head first while rescue workers
pumped oxygen into the well with a fan and garden hose.
   Suddenly, ``One of the people (the grandson) began to move,''
Oliver said. ``I stopped, and we started yelling at him, and he
regained consciousness.''
   The son managed to put a lifebelt around himself and around his
grandfather to keep his head out of the waist-deep water, Oliver
said.
   After Stillwell was pulled to safety, Oliver went down and
secured a rope to the grandfather, who was also lifted out.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department said Friday it has
delayed the deployment of a new Aegis guided-missle cruiser to the
Persian Gulf as part of a reassessment of U.S. military operations
in that area.
   ``This is a temporary postponement while the current situation
in the Gulf is reassessed,'' Navy Cmdr. Mel Sundin said referring
to the USS Mobile Bay's delayed voyage to the Gulf.
   The cruiser was scheduled to leave its Mayport, Fla. home port
Friday to replace the U.S. Vincennes which ends its Gulf tour in
September. The Vincennes, another Aegis cruiser, shot down an
Iranian Airbus on July 3, killing all 290 aboard.
   ``As the secretary (of defense) said earlier this week _ We've
always said we shape our forces according to the threat,'' he said,
indicating the possible effect the recent Iran-Iraq cease-fire
agreement.
   Sundin said ``a final decision on deployment will be made as
ongoing assessment indicates what level of forces are needed to
ensure continued safe and unimpeded operations in the Gulf.''
   Although there were no immediate plans to pull any of the 27
ships assigned to the Gulf, other than those previously scheduled
for rotation, a Pentagon statement said a decision had not been
made on the deployment of four relief ships scheduled to leave for
the Gulf next week.

<HEAD>Treaty That Ended Indian War Bought By Tribe's Descendants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Villagers from Klukwan have paid an art
dealer in New Mexico an undisclosed sum for what is believed to be
a 112-year-old peace treaty between the Stikeen and Chilkat Indians.
   The treaty ended 12 years of bloodshed between the tribes.
   The documents was signed, perhaps in blood, at Fort Wrangell in
1876 by Chief Shakes of the Stikeen Indians and Chief Se-gua-sha of
the Chilkat Indians.
   The treaty wound up in the collection of Santa Fe, N.M., art
dealer David Kramer. Villagers from Klukwan bought the document
from him last week.
   Klukwan, where descendants of the Chilkats still live, is
located in the Chilkat Bald Eagle Reserve, about 22 miles north of
Haines. It is the oldest Tlingit settlement in southeastern Alaska;
the Chilkat and Stikeen tribal groups were part of the Tlingit
nation.
   After the treaty is authenticated, it will be put on display at
the planned Klukwan Eagle Observatory and Cultural Heritage Center.
Construction of the center should be completed in three years, said
Klukwan Heritge Foundation President Janice Clayton Hill.
   The treaty includes a pair of red wax seals with narrow ribbons
next to the chiefs' marks, and a blue seal indicating it arrived at
Fort Sitka on Feb. 3, 1876.
   Kramer said he has had the treaty for about 10 years. He said he
bought it from the estate of an Indian artifact collector, who
obtained it in Seattle in the early 1970s.
   After being contacted by an associate of Kramer, Hill said she
and Village Council President Joe Hotch questioned elders and dug
up old records to verify there were battles between the Chilkats
and Stikeens in that time period, and apparently a treaty.
   ``We got enough information to make us realize the historical
importance of this to us,'' she said.
   Kramer said variations in coloration in the document's text
indicate it may have been written and signed in blood. ``It appears
to be blood, but it would take a test to confirm it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Flap Over ``Souvenirs'' Being Resolved</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union are
resolving what officials describe as a minor incident in which
American technical experts removed some materials as ``souvenirs''
from a Soviet nuclear test site without authorization.
   The three U.S. experts are being relieved of their duties as
members of an American team assigned to monitor Soviet atomic
blasts. They were in the Soviet Union at the Semipalatinsk test
site as part of a joint verification program when the incident
occurred last month.
   Administration spokesmen said Friday the items found by Soviet
authorities in crates being prepared for shipment back home
included a small hammer, a piece of barbed wire, and several rock
and core samples from a hole being drilled at the site.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that after
consultations with Soviet authorities, it was decided that the
three, who were not identified, will not return to the testing site
next month.
   One was said to be an Energy Department employee and the other
two reportedly were working under Energy Department contracts.
   The Soviets expressed concern over the incident but no formal
protest was lodged, Redman said.
   According to Redman, the issue has been discussed at length
between U.S. and Soviet authorities and is being resolved.
   He added that the joint monitoring program will continue with a
U.S. test set for Aug. 17 in Nevada and the Soviet test scheduled
for mid-September.
   Redman said the hammer and the barbed wire were intended as
personal souvenirs. As for the geological samples, the Americans
asked the Soviets for permission to remove the items and had reason
to believe the request would be approved, he said.
   ``These items were of a minor nature, certainly not of any
military or technical significance,'' Redman said, describing the
incident as a ``misunderstanding.''
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said, ``We don't believe it was intelligence activity of any kind,
but it was a personal mistake on their part.''
   Asked whether it wasn't strange for Americans to try to make off
with rocks and soil, Redman said, ``If you're involved in this kind
of work, those might be considered souvenirs.''
   The Washington Post reported in Friday's editions that the soil
and rock samples are regarded by U.S. officials as potentially
useful in assessing yields of Soviet nuclear blasts.
   One official told the Post that soil samples can be examined for
radioactive contamination, which might reveal the type and quantity
of nuclear materials used in nuclear bombs.
   But Redman said the rock and core samples were of the same type
as that already provided to U.S. experts by the Soviets.

<HEAD>Company Denies Using Nancy Reagan's Name For Profit in `Just Say
No' Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SEPPY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Procter and Gamble Co. official denies that
the corporation has used first lady Nancy Reagan's name for profit
in its effort to support her ``Just Say No'' program to stop drug
abuse among youngsters.
   Gerald S. Gendell, P&G's public affairs manager, said from
Cincinnati on Friday that the allegations made by Rep. Charles B.
Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House drug committee, and two
former employees of the antidrug program were ``unjustified,
self-serving and without merit.''
   Gendell said the remarks by Tom Adams, who resigned as president
of the Just Say No foundation last week, were ``very
disappointing'' in that ``he now takes this action in this
vengeful, unjustified attack on Procter and Gamble, placing the
very organization he expresses concern for in jeopardy.''
   Rangel, with Adams and Joan Brann, former vice president of the
foundation, at his side, criticized the exclusive use and alleged
commercialization of the first lady's name by Procter and Gamble in
the antidrug program.
   ``I don't think anyone has the exclusive right to the first
lady's picture, the White House and the kids that write in,''
Rangel told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol. ``I
would like Procter and Gamble to say this program makes sense. We
will support it, but I don't want them to say other companies can't
join.''
   Gendell said the exclusivity with the antidrug program was for
the period of a particular promotion which, he said, is standard
procedure in any cause-related marketing effort.
   W.W. Abbott of Procter and Gamble, who is chairman of the
foundation, asked Adams and Brann to resign. Gendell said Abbott
asked Adams to resign because when Abbott took over the foundation
job in February, he had an audit done which revealed ``a major
financial and management problem'' __ the organization was more
than $600,000 in debt and it was threatened with a lawsuit for an
additional alleged debt of $130,000.
   Adams would not accept responsibility for these financial
problems even though he was the foundation's chief executive since
its formation, Gendell said. He said he did not know until Friday
that Brann had resigned.
   ``I would like Wallace Abbott to resign, return the program to
its grass roots and then apologize to the children and parents,''
Adams said.
   Adams said he does not believe Mrs. Reagan was involved in the
exclusive contract with Procter and Gamble which he said donated
$150,000 to the program. ``It was her chief of staff,'' he said.
   Jack L. Courtemanche, the first lady's chief of staff, was not
available immediately for comment.
   Abbott also was not available but Gendell said: ``The
allegations by Congressman Rangel and Mr. Adams about Procter and
Gamble and the Just Say No program are unjustified, self-serving
and totally without merit.''
   The corporation is involved in the program, Gendell said,
``because we feel it is a very worthwhile undertaking which is
doing work in helping prevent drug abuse.''
   ``The company's efforts and substantial financial contributions
have been directed at trying to save this program, not take it over
as claimed by Mr. Adams,'' he said. ``We also strongly deny the
allegations that we have in any way abused the Just Say No program.
Procter and Gamble's participation had the full support of Mrs.
Reagan and the White House staff. Any use of her name was cleared
in advance.''
   He also said Procter and Gamble has given the program more than
$150,000 which was for a campaign last year. He said the company
has committed $250,000 to retire the foundation's debt of $600,000
and given $150,000 this year.
   Rangel said he does not believe the White House had anything to
do with the commercialization of the drug program, in which blank
donation pledges to assist the antidrug foundation were included in
a mailing to 48 million households along with coupons for Proctor
and Gamble products, such as soap, cooking oil, coffee and diapers.
   The New York congressman said he is disturbed that the
foundation, and its volunteers, are being used ``to increase sales
of Proctor and Gamble products.''
   Rangel gave out a March 23, 1987, letter from Procter and Gamble
to the foundation in which the company said all competition by
other retailers must be eliminated. ``Any breech of this
agreement,'' the letter said, ``will preclude Procter and Gamble's
interest in supporting Just Say No in years to come.''
   The letter also says that the company was excited about teaching
youngsters to stay drug free, but ``we remind you that our primary
objective is build the business.''
   ``Clearly, it was never the first lady's intention to allow a
soap company to use this program and the children of our nation for
commercial profit,'' said Rangel.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of workers employed by farmers this
summer declined slightly from a year ago, but their wages are up,
according to a quarterly survey by the Agriculture Department.
   The survey taken last month indicated 1.2 million hired workers
were employed by farmers, compared with 1.27 million a year earlier.
   Those did not include 303,000 ``agricultural service'' workers
provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors. A year ago 258,000
were counted.
   ``Temperatures soared to over 100 degrees throughout much of the
nation during the survey week of July 10-16,'' the report said
Friday.
   ``Winter wheat harvest was 82 percent complete by the week's
end, 10 points ahead of the five-year average,'' the report said.
``Cotton harvest was under way in the Texas Rio Grande Valley.
Peach harvest was in full swing along the east coast. California's
vegetable harvest consisted mostly of broccoli, cauliflower,
carrots, celery, melons and onions. Harvest of cherries,
raspberries and blueberries was active in Oregon and Washington
state.''
   The report said the national figures for hired workers had a
sampling error of 3.6 percent.
   Average pay for all workers hired directly by farmers was $4.90
per hour, up 12 cents per hour from a year earlier, the report
showed.
   For workers provided by contractors, there was no national wage
rage available. However, workers in California averaged $5.74 per
hour, down from $6.48 a year ago, while those in Florida received
an average of $5.19 per hour, up from $5.13 a year ago.

<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency says a
record $2.5 million settlement involving a commercial hazardous
waste facility in Louisiana should send the message to other
companies that failure to comply with environmental rules will
prove costly.
   ``EPA will not tolerate hazardous waste mismanagement in this
country, especially by the nation's major disposal companies,'' EPA
Administrator Lee M. Thomas said in announcing the settlement
Friday.
   ``This significant penalty should send a signal to all waste
handlers that the cost of non-compliance with our requirements will
be more costly than compliance,'' Thomas said.
   A federal and state suit against CECOS International Inc., a
subsidiary of Houston-based Browning-Ferris Inc., had charged more
than 1,700 violations of federal environmental regulations at the
firm's disposal facility in Livingston, La., about 40 miles east of
Baton Rouge.
   The settlement represented the highest penalty ever obtained in
a hazardous waste court case, said Robin Woods, an EPA spokeswoman.
   EPA said inspections of the facility in 1985-86 had found
violations such as landfilling of ignitable waste, failure to
analyze hazardous waste properly, unauthorized waste piles,
inadequate recordkeeping and failure to conduct facility
inspections and personnel training.
   Under terms of a consent decree filed in U.S. District Court in
Baton Rouge, CECOS is to pay $1.1 million to the federal
government, $900,000 to the state of Louisiana and $500,000 to
Louisiana State University to fund environmental education programs.
   CECOS, based in Buffalo, N.Y., also has agreed to implement an
advanced computer tracking system and to carry out a series of
independent environmental audits at the Livingston facility, the
company said.
   The audits are intended to be a comprehensive check on the
facility's compliance with the Clean Water Act, the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act and the Clean Air Act, the company
said.
   ``This is a good, solid agreement,'' CECOS President Robert V.
Price said in a statement. ``While it is critical for the public to
understand that the facility at no time was a threat to public
health, this settlement nevertheless is important because it gets
the issues and the lawsuit behind us. It sets in motion new
programs, not required by law, that will make our facility one of
the safest in the business.''
   The consent decree, a legal document settling the lawsuit,
becomes final after a 30-day public review and comment period and
approval by the court.

<HEAD>EPA Cites Ford For Alleged Emission Control Warranty Violations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is
threatening Ford Motor Co. with $230,000 in penalties for allegedly
failing to fix defective emissions control components under
warranty.
   The automaker said it hoped something could be worked out and
accused the agency of changing its interpretation of the federal
law that sets standards for automotive emissions.
   An EPA notice of violation, made public Friday, said Ford in 23
instances from 1984 through this year denied warranty service for
emission-control components that failed because a non-covered
component.
   The EPA's field operations director, Richard Kozlowski, said the
agency's position reflects the meaning of the Clean Air Act of 1974.
   ``The act is the act, and it refers to the vehicle meeting
emissions standards, not the particular parts,'' he said.
   Ford, however, said the agency should change rules that apply
industry-wide rather than singling out Ford.
   ``It is not a new issue,'' said Donald Buist, Ford's automotive
emissions and fuel economy director in Dearborn, Mich. ``What we've
got here is a new interpretation of a longstanding emissions
policy.''
   Kozlowski, however, said EPA's interpretation is one ``we've had
... from day one.''
   ``Our point is that if the manifold fails in a way that causes
the catalyst to fail, replacing the catalyst on the warranty
doesn't fix the problem,'' he said. ``It will fail again and again.
The only way to fix the problem so the vehicle meets standards is
to replace the part that causes the failure.''
   He said other automakers, ``whether they do it for goodwill, to
keep us off their back, or whether they believe it is covered,''
fix emission-related components whose failure is caused by
non-covered equipment, and the EPA believes Ford should do the same.
   The EPA said the $230,000 in civil penalties could be lessened
if Ford were to change its policy on emission-defect warranties.
   Should Ford and EPA not settle the complaint within 90 days, the
agency's normal procedure would be to refer the matter to the
Justice Department with a recommendation that a civil complaint be
filed in federal court, the notice of violation said.
   Buist said Ford intends to resolve the matter through
discussions with the EPA. `` `Resolution' means to the satisfaction
of both parties,'' he said.
   The EPA notice of violation, dated Aug. 5, was made public by
the Coalition for Auto Repair Choice, a trade association
representing the auto parts and repair industries.
   Both Ford and the EPA acknowledged that the notice had been
issued.
   A spokeswoman for the coalition, Pamela Kostmayer, declined to
say how the EPA notice was obtained.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It will be easier for military authorities to
advise the spouses of reservists if their mates test positively for
the deadly AIDS virus under new guidelines issued by Deputy Defense
Secretary William H. Taft IV.
   Under a 1987 policy statement, if military personnel tested
positively and agreed to provide the names of his or her sexual
partners to medical authorities for counseling, the military doctor
could relay those names to local health officials unless prohibited
by state law.
   That policy has now been expanded to say the military doctor can
directly contact the spouse of a reservist if that reservist has
tested positively. The spouse may then be offered AIDS testing and
counseling at a military hospital or clinic, Taft decided, even
though the spouse of a reservist is not normally eligible for
military health care.
   The guidelines continue to allow doctors to notify spouses of
active duty personnel.
   The policy statement issued Friday extends the Pentagon's AIDS
testing program for another year, continuing the mandatory blood
screening for all military personnel on active duty, all reservists
and National Guard members and all men and women seeking to join
the armed services.
   It further continues the practice of allowing military personnel
who test positively to remain on active duty until they show signs
of the actual disease.
   However, it rejects for the time being mandatory testing of
civilian defense employees destined for overseas posts. Such
civilian workers will be tested only if they are being assigned to
a foreign country whose government requires such a test.
   AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ attacks the body's
immune system and its ability to resist infection. No cure has been
found. Most of its victims are homosexuals, intravenous drug users
and people receiving tainted blood transfusions, although the
disease also is spreading through sexual contacts to the general
population.
   As of Monday, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 39,620 have died since June 1981, according
to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to have
recovered from AIDS.
   The Defense Department, under policy statements first adopted in
late 1985, conducts the largest AIDS screening program in the
world. More than 4 million individuals have been tested under the
program, which the Pentagon justifies primarily on the need to
protect military blood supplies.
   The latest policy continued the practice of prohibiting any
recruit applicant from joining the military, a college ROTC program
or attending a military academy if he or she tests positively for
AIDS.

<TEXT>
   George Bush wanted a 1988 Republican Party
platform full of specifics. He got it _ more than 30,000 words of
details and rhetoric about ``leadership to direct the forces of
change ... guided by American values.''
   After a full week of deliberations, the platform committee on
Friday fitted the last planks in place in the conservative document
that lays out the Bush agenda for the future.
   ``We're a conservative political party,'' said Republican Party
chief Frank J. Fahrenkopf. ``We're proud of that. We're not afraid
of the `c' word.''
   If the conservatives were happy with the final form readied for
the convention next week, the party's moderates said they were not
running away.
   ``We feel this is a progressive platform,'' said Gov. John
McKernan of Maine.
   ``There are some things in this platform I do not like,'' said
Rep. Jan Meyers of Kansas, but ``conservatives and moderates in the
Republican Party can run on it and not from it.''
   And there were no reports of anyone so unhappy with the platform
as to be drafting a minority report to spark a floor fight next
week.
   But Democrats, who produced a 5,000-word thematic document at
their convention in Atlanta last month, were quick to ridicule the
GOP platform.
   ``The GOP has cooked up a platform that is a version of 1980 and
1984 warmed-over broken promises,'' said Democratic Party chief
Paul Kirk. ``Once again, the Republicans are talking about the
future through a rear-view mirror.''
   ``They're doing everything they can to avoid talking about their
candidate and leadership,'' said Leslie Dach, communications
director for Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis,
adding the document was ``a right-wing platform proudly mired in
the past.''
   The long and often tedious platform work ended on a high note as
committee chairman Kay Orr, the Nebraska governor, unveiled her
preamble that opens the document.
   ``An election is about the future, about change,'' she read.
``The election will bring change. The question is: Will it be
change and progress with the Republicans or change and chaos with
the Democrats?''
   ``Americans want leadership to direct the forces of change ...
guided by American values,'' she went on.
   Then she choked up briefly as she read the final sentences:
   ``At the very heart of this platform is our belief that the
strength of America is its people. ... They are still eager to
grasp the future, to seize the chaos of experience and through
faith and love and work, to transfer it into the valuable, the
useful and the beautiful.
   ``This is what the American people do, quietly, patiently,
without headlines, as a nation of communities every day. ... It is
to them we dedicate this platform.''
   The 106-member committee ended work Friday and a final draft of
the document will be released late today. The final committee vote
comes Monday afternoon in preparation for the convention floor
discussion Tuesday.
   Friday's work was concentrated on foreign policy and defense,
areas where Bush believes he has an advantage over Dukakis.
   There were some squabbles, but most disputes were settled
quietly such as the question of how quickly to deploy the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   Language calling for ``rapid and certain deployment'' of the
Star Wars missile defense system prevailed, authored by
conservatives led by Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan of California. The
Bush campaign simply said the language was fine, though it was
slightly firmer than the call for deployment as soon as feasible
that the campaign had favored.
   ``We were thrilled with the original language and we're happy
with where we are,'' said New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu, a Bush
representative on the committee. ``You're arguing over nuances.''
   The Bush campaign also added at the last minute a summary
chapter on defense and foreign policy, saying it grew out of a
meeting three weeks ago with Bush.
   ``It's a Bush national security strategy document,'' said
Charlie Black, the campaign's chief staffer on platform matters.
   The original draft of the new chapter included no mention of
SDI, but it was added in a hurriedly called subcommittee meeting
Friday afternoon.
   Black and former Sen. John Tower of Texas both denied any
significance to the omission.
   Despite the platform's conservative tone, it was not strong
enough on foreign policy for some of the committee members.
   ``The Russian bear hasn't changed _ they've just dressed him up
in a three-piece suit and Gucci loafers,'' said Jim Summers of
Washington.
   The committee agreed to a strong statement denouncing South
Africa's racial policies: ``Republicans deplore the apartheid
system of South Africa and consider it morally repugnant.''
   Then a struggle erupted between the Bush campaign and more
militant committee members over how to describe the source of the
troubles in that region of the world. The platform already blamed
``Marxist imperialism which actively supports the march of tyranny
in Africa.''
   Bush forces, firmly in control, wanted no variations in
carefully crafted language and turned back all major changes.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua on
Friday offered to renew peace talks with U.S.-supported rebels
either in Managua or Washington.
   Ortega, who is on an official visit to Ecuador, also criticized
the U.S. Congress for approving new aid to the rebels and called it
an act of ``aggression.'' He demanded that such aid be stopped.
   Adolfo Calero, a rebel leader, on Friday rejected Managua as the
site for peace talks, saying the ``climate doesn't exist'' for them
to be held there. He also demanded that Ortega personally attend
future talks.
   In a separate meeting with reporters in Quito, Cuban President
Fidel Castro said he was willing to help bring ``a fair peace'' to
Central America.
   On Thursday, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who won the 1987
Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring peace to Central
America, said he asked Castro for assistance in achieving that
goal. Arias said at the time that nothing concrete had been
achieved.
   Representatives of the left-wing Sandinista government and the
Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras agreed on a cease-fire March 23
under a regional peace plan that Ortega and four other Central
American presidents signed in August 1987.
   The cease-fire often has been violated but extended by both
sides, most recently by Nicaragua unilaterally until Aug. 30. But
the two sides have deadlocked on a permanent truce and have failed
to agree on a site or date for talks since the last round ended
June 9.
   Leaders of the Contras said they would hold no further meetings
in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital. The Contras claimed the
Sandinistas refused to allow them freedom of movement.
   ``We invite the Contras ... to come to Managua'' Aug. 26-29,
Ortega told a news conference.
   ``We see no sense in having the meeting in another country,'' he
said. ``The only place outside of Managua that we would accept
would be Washington. In Washington, it would be possible to achieve
something because Washington is part of the aggression against
Nicaragua.''
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate approved by a 49-47 vote a
Democratic plan to provide $27 million in humanitarian assistance
to the Contras. Senate Republicans, who had sought military as well
as humanitarian assistance, voted against the proposal.
   ``We are not going to Managua, because there we are treated like
prisoners. We would arrive (in Managua) only to be in the hands of
and to suffer the arbitrariness of the Sandinista regime,'' Calero
said in remarks broadcast by the rebels' clandestine Radio
Liberacion.
   Calero set a number of conditions before the rebels would return
to the bargaining table, including the reopening of the Roman
Catholic station Radio Catolica and radio news programs shut down
by the Sandinistas in July.
   Calero also demanded the release of more than 40 opposition
figures detained by the government when police violently broke up
an anti-government demonstration July 10 in Nandaimes, about 40
miles south of Managua.
   President Ortega also must be present at any future negotiating
session, Calero said.
   The peace plan, which aims to negotiate an end to the 7-year-old
war in Nicaragua as well as leftist guerrilla wars in El Salvador
and Guatemala, calls for cease-fires, democratic reforms and an end
to outside military assistance to rebels.
   Speaking with reporters Friday, Castro said:
   ``In truth, whatever we might be able to do for a fair peace, a
peace with dignity, we would always do.''
   But Castro said no country should have to pay for peace by
giving up its freedom.
   ``Peace does not depend on us. Peace depends on the
aggressors,'' he said. ``It is much more correct to say peace
depends on the policies that the United States follows, not those
that we follow.''
   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, Castro and Arias were
among those attending Wednesday's inauguration of Ecuadorian
President Rodrigo Borga, a moderate leftist who replaced Leon
Febres Cordero, a conservative.
   It was Castro's first trip to South America in 17 years. The
presidents of Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia and Venezuela also were
present for the inauguration.
   Ortega arrived the day after the inauguration, because Febres
Cordero cut off diplomatic relations with Nicaragua in 1985.

<HEAD>DOT Says Seat Belt Use Up to 43 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The percentage of people using seat belts has
almost quadrupled in the past five years, but fewer than half the
nation's motorists buckle up, according to the Transportation
Department.
   Surveys in 19 cities showed that more than 43 percent of U.S.
motorists use the safety devices, the department said, attributing
the major portion of the increase from 11 percent five years ago to
mandatory seat belt use laws in many states.
   A total of 32 states and the District of Columbia require
front-seat occupants of vehicles to wear seat belts.
   ``Increasingly public acceptance of safety belts is saving lives
and preventing injuries,'' Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley
said Friday, estimating that 4,000 lives were saved because of seat
belt use in 1987.
   The 19-city survey covered 49,095 observations of motorists from
February through May of this year. It showed 43.4 percent of the
front-seat occupants wore safety belts, according to the
department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   Similar surveys in 1982 showed belt use to be at about 11
percent, the agency said.
   The survey indicated a wide range of seat belt use, with
motorists most likely to wear their belts in Dallas (71.4 percent),
Houston (65.6 percent) and Seattle (60.3 percent). The cities with
the lowest use rate were Providence, R.I. (15.4 percent),
Fargo-Moorhead, N.D., (21.7 percent) and New York City (24.6
percent).
   Belt use was sharply higher in cities where laws require
motorists to use the belts, the agency said. It said that in 13
cities in states with safety belt use laws, belt use was 48.3
percent, while in six cities without such laws it was 30.4 percent.
   Here is the rate of belt usage in each of the 19 cities
surveyed, according to the highway safety agency.
   Cities not covered by a belt-use law:
   Providence, R.I., 15.4 percent; Fargo-Moorhead, N.D., 21.7
percent; Boston, 31.2 percent; Atlanta, 36.4 percent; Birmingham,
Ala., 39.5 percent; Phoenix, Ariz., 40.6 percent.
   Cities covered by a belt-use law:
   New York, 24.6 percent; Pittsburgh, 28.1 percent; Chicago, 31.7
percent; New Orleans, 43.3 percent; Baltimore, 46.7 percent; Los
Angeles, 47.3 percent; Minneapolis-St. Paul, 47.8 percent; Miami,
51.9 percent; San Francisco, 53.4 percent; San Diego, 59.4 percent;
Seattle, 60.3 percent; Houston, 65.6 percent; Dallas, 71.4 percent.

August 7 of congestive heart failure. He was 94.
   Faltersack met Harry Houdini while working his way through San
Jose State University and the famous musician appeared at a theater.
   He took Houdini to see the Winchester Mystery House, a tourist
attraction with optical illusions and other amusements, where
Faltersack worked as a tour guide. And in later years, he helped
Houdini build some of his illusions.
   In the early 1930s, Faltersack was appointed as a special

<HEAD>Material Witness Held In Terrorist Case Fears For Family, Lawyer
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer for a Middle East man jailed here
as a material witness in the 1985 hijacking of a Jordanian airliner
says her client fears for the safety of his family in Beirut.
   Mouin Abdul Ajam was arrested in California on Thursday and
brought here following a hearing before a federal magistrate in
Sacramento, according to court records in that city. Authorities
believe he could implicate Fawaz Younis, a suspected Lebanese
terrorist, in the hijacking.
   Ajam is ``extremely concerned'' that if he cooperates with the
prosecutors in the case, his family in Beirut will be killed in
retaliation by terrorist groups sympathetic to Younis, said Jessica
McGuire, an assistant federal public defender who represented Ajam
in Sacramento.
   ``He has every reason to fear retaliation against his family in
Beirut,'' she said. Ajam complained that the U.S. government is
``not taking enough precautions regarding his family,'' she said.
   Ms. McGuire declined to give more information about her client,
citing his concerns for the safety of his family.
   Younis, a former member of Lebanon's Shiite Amal militia, was
arrested last September after he was lured aboard an FBI-chartered
yacht in the Mediterranean, is awaiting trial here on charges that
he led the June 11, 1985 hijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner in
Beirut.
   Ajam was named in an arrest warrant outlining Justice Department
concerns that he might not cooperate in the prosecution of Younis,
Ms. McGuire said.
   Federal prosecutors here have also filed a motion to compel Ajam
to give a sworn deposition about the case, said sources familiar
with the case who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell declined to comment.
   Federal prosecutors have jurisdiction to prosecute the Younis
case because the plane was carrying several Americans. No date has
been set for Younis' trial in U.S. District Court here.
   Ajam is one of several Middle Easterners who prosecutors have
said could give evidence against Younis.
   Prosecutors disclosed in court last month that two airline crew
members are in protective custody after agreeing to come to this
country and testify against Younis.
   U.S. Magistrate Esther Mix in Sacramento ordered Ajam detained,
and U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker, who issued the
warrant for Ajam's arrest, has scheduled a bail hearing on Monday.
   The Royal Jordanian Airliner was hijacked at the Beirut Airport
by four armed men and forced to fly to several locations in the
Mediterranean. Following its return to Beirut the next day, the
jetliner was blown up after 74 passengers and crew members were
taken off the aircraft.
   The trial is being delayed while prosecutors appeal Parker's
ruling that the FBI illegally obtained statements from Younis
during a four-day interrogation following his arrest at sea. The
judge ruled the admissions couldn't be used as evidence against
Younis because the defendant didn't understand his constitutional
protection against self-incrimination.

   Here are some comments Friday from the
presidential campaign trail:
   
   PRESIDENT REAGAN, at a spirited pre-convention sendoff for
George Bush: ``I suspect most people will vote for George Bush this
year because, after voting for him once or twice before, they know
he's their guarantee that peace and prosperity today will be
followed by peace and prosperity tomorrow. And frankly, I don't
think the American people want to gamble their future on a blind
date.''
   
   GEORGE BUSH, assailing Democrats while hailing Reagan: ``We all
know what will kill, definitively kill, this economic expansion
we've worked so hard to create. Those same Democrats, the McGovern
or Carter or Mondale Democrats, are just itching to get their hands
back on the levers that you operate so ably.''
   
   Illinois Gov. JAMES R. THOMPSON, said to be on the list of
Republican vice presidential possibilities, asking that his name be
withdrawn from consideration: ``The vice president's job requires a
lot of national and international travel. My wife couldn't travel
with me because I've got a 10-year-old in school, and that's not
true of the other candidates.''
   
   MICHAEL DUKAKIS, saying he opposes new offshore drilling for oil
and gas, noting his efforts to block drilling off Massachusetts:
``I'm not a George-come-lately on this issue.''

<HEAD>Scientists Say Coral Reefs May Provide Knowledge About Weather
Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER O'LOUGHLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coral reefs contain a wealth of
information on climate changes that occurred centuries ago and
could help predict the world's weather, scientists say.
   About 750 scientists from 53 nations attended a symposium on
coral reefs that ended Friday.
   They also discussed the fate of coral reefs attacked by
crown-of-thorns starfish that devour living coral. Most of the
participants believed the reefs recover quickly, but others said
the reefs could be dead for centuries.
   ``The most important thing to come out of the conference was the
recognition that coral reefs are the repositories of a wealth of
data going back millions of years,'' said Peter Davies, chairman of
the symposium at James Cook University.
   The university is a few miles from a section of the
1,200-mile-long Great Barrier Reef off Australia's northeastern
coastline.
   ``Reefs have got all the data on sea-level change, weather,
climate, the greenhouse effect,'' Davies said.
   Scientists use the term ``greenhouse effect'' to refer to
pollution that accummulates in the atmosphere and traps energy from
the sun, causing the Earth's temperature to rise.
   Davies said that scientists using such techniques as drilling
core samples of living corals of great age could measure old
climatic changes.
   ``The information in the corals will let us make sensible
predictions,'' he said. ``They are like a huge library. ... It was
reported here for the first time that we are seeing the same or
similar structures in old corals in the Sinai Desert as we see in
living corals now.
   ``And those corals in the Sinai were uplifted and exposed into
what is now arid land 250,000 years ago.''
   Davies also said scientists are studying the biochemistry of
corals in search of a substance that could protect humans from
sunburn.
   ``Corals in shallow water produce a natural suncreen. If they
didn't, they'd die of sunburn,'' Davies said, and the research has
``a large potential.''
   Crown-of-thorn starfish are found throughout the world, but
periodically they appear in vast numbers in parts of the Great
Barrier Reef and may destroy up to 90 percent of the coral on a
reef.
   Scientists said it has not been determined why the starfish
appear when they do, and there is no known method of controlling
them.
   Davies said most evidence indicates the starfish are part of the
reef cycle and the reefs quickly recover.
   But Robert Endean, a professor at the University of Queensland,
told the conference it would take centuries for large corals to
recover and then only if the starfish did not return while they
were regrowing.
   Australian scientists said they had tried injecting the starfish
with copper sulphate, catching them by hand, installing underwater
wire fences and infecting them with bacteria, but nothing worked.
   The scientists were told the Australian armed forces once sent
divers to kill the starfish, but the cost came to about $20 per
dead fish.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega marked
his fifth anniversary as Panama's military leader by delivering a
diatribe against the United States, which has tried to oust him
from power.
   Noriega, head of Panama's Defense Forces, said the Reagan
administration created a false crisis in an attempt to revoke the
1977 Panama Canal Treaties, which turn over control of the vital
waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   The United States is ``using lies, falsehoods and politics to
keep North American youth in (military) service (in Panama) under
the risk of war that their government is provoking,'' he declared
Friday.
   ``Many Panamanians wrongly thought ... Panama and the United
States were beginning a permanent honeymoon, forgetting that for
the United States a treaty is no more ... than a useful but
emphemeral act. The United States signs treaties knowing that it is
going to violate them,'' he said.
   About 12,000 U.S. military personnel are based in Panama to
protect the canal. The headquarters of the U.S Southern Command,
which directs all American military activities in Central and South
America, also is in Panama.
   Noriega spoke before an audience of thousands of government
officials, supporters, soldiers and civilian militia at an old
section of Albrook Air Force Base that has been taken over by
Panama under the canal treaties.
   The general began his speech by waving his fist toward the U.S.
Command headquarters nearby and saying: ``Welcome to the territory
of Panama in the Canal Zone. Welcome until you march.''
   Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces and the power behind the
civilian government, is under federal indictment in the United
States on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.
Washington has sought his ouster since early this year, applying
economic sanctions that have helped push Panama into its worst
depression since the 1930s.
   The general, who took command of the Panama Defense Forces on
Aug. 12, 1983, has refused to bow to U.S. and internal pressure for
his resignation and departure.

<TEXT>
   Bottles of a prescription allergy and cold
medicine syrup called Promethazine VC Plain that contain a thick,
white lotion instead of the normal clear, orange-yellow syrup
should not be ingested, the Food and Drug Administration warned.
   The agency said Friday that the white lotion may be lindane, a
medicine for parasitic mites known as scabies, that could cause
severe convulsions if taken by children.
   Pint bottles of My-K and Rugby brands of Promethazine VC Plain
syrup made by My-K Laboratories, lot 15880, were being recalled
from pharmacies, the FDA said.
   The FDA asked consumers to watch for the white lotion because
the bottles purchased from drug stores may not have the lot number
or distributor's name as some pharmacists may have transferred the
product to smaller bottles.
   Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Morton Grove, Ill., which recently
purchased My-K Laboratories, began the recall after a pharmacist in
Racine, Wis., discovered a pint bottle of the lindane lotion
mislabeled as promethazine syrup.

<HEAD>Attorney Trying to Win New Trial for Convicted Killer Unveils New
Evidence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARCADIA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney and an author presented a
packed auditorium Friday with two sworn affidavits indicating a
babysitter confessed to poisoning seven children and that their
imprisoned stepfather is innocent.
   The statements presented by attorney John Robinson and author
Mark Lane are part of an effort to win a new trial for James Joseph
Richardson, 52, who has served more 20 years of a life sentence for
poisoning his eldest child with the insecticide parathion.
   The affidavits from Belinda Romeo and Doris Harris, workers at
the Hardee Manor Nursing Home in Wachula, said Bessie Reece
admitted the 1967 murders of the children, age 2 to 8.
   Ms. Romeo claims to have cared for Ms. Reece from January 1985
to last year at the nursing home.
   According to Ms. Romeo's affidavit, Ms. Reece said, ``Yes, I
killed those children. ... I killed them but I don't know why.''
   ``I was certain she understood my question,'' Ms. Romeo said in
the statement.
   Ms. Reece, now 67, was a neighbor of Richardson's in Arcadia. At
the time the children were slain, Ms. Reece had been on parole from
a sentence for killing her husband.
   More than 20 years after the killings, the case still holds
enough interest here that residents filled the auditorium of the
community center, a former elementary school.
   Robinson defended Richardson at a highly publicized four-day
murder trial in 1968 in which prosecutors claimed Richardson
sprinkled the insecticide on the children's lunch of hog jowl and
beans. Richardson was charged with all seven deaths but was
convicted only in the death of his oldest stepdaughter. Charges
were dropped against his wife.
   Investigators charged that Richardson intended to collect $1,000
in life insurance on each child from a policy that he had tried to
buy _ but had not paid for _ from a traveling salesman on the night
before the mass murder.
   The statements of guilt attributed to Ms. Reece were said to
have been made after she entered the nursing home but before state
officials deemed her mentally incompetent.
   DeSoto County Sheriff Joe Varnadore said through a department
spokesman Wednesday that he has reviewed the new evidence but
hasn't decided whether to reopen the investigation.
   Richardson, 52, is at the Tomoka Correctional Institution in
Daytona Beach, where he is scheduled to become eligible for parole
in 1993.

<HEAD>Paccar Recalls As Many as 10,000 Peterbilt, Kenworth Trucks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paccar, one of the country's largest big truck
manufacturers, has recalled as many as 10,000 Peterbilt and
Kenworth trucks that may have defective power-steering gearboxes.
   The Bellevue-based company said the trucks subject to the recall
were produced after March and range in value from $60,000 to more
than $100,000 apiece.
   Paccar spokesman Jack McRae said the gearbox supplier, Ross Gear
Division of TRW, asked Paccar to suspend delivery of its top-of-the
line class 8 trucks because of potential defects. McRae said Paccar
and TRW officials met Friday to determine the precise problem and
how to resolve it.
   McRae said the company planned to keep production going, then
store the trucks until the problem is isolated and fixed. Paccar
produces more than 2,000 of the trucks each month.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, this is the most significant
recall we've had,'' he said.
   Other makers also use the gearbox, McRae added.
   No accidents or injuries have been reported, McRae said. As soon
as Paccar found out about the problem it sent out messages to
dealers urging them to tell owners of Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks
built since March to pull them off the road, the company said.
   Paccar issued a statement at the close of the business day
Thursday about the problem.
   The stock market initially failed to take notice. An hour into
trading Friday, the stock was ahead 12.5 cents at $36.875 a share.
After a Dow Jones News Service headline on Paccar appeared 75
minutes into the trading day, the stock quickly plunged. Four hours
later, about an hour before the market closed, Paccar had fallen to
$33.50 a share on volume of 482,000 shares. In all of June, Paccar
volume was 760,700.
   McRae said based on what little the company knows about the
problem so far, it will not cause serious financial loss.

<HEAD>Administration Says It Will Deny Money to Clinics That Advise on
Abortions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration will begin applying
new regulations denying federal money to family planning clinics
that give women information about abortions unless the clinics are
covered by court injunctions barring enforcement of the rules.
   A spokesman for several family planning groups said the decision
was a political ploy timed to please conservatives before next
week's Republican National Convention.
   As a practical matter, the announcement Friday by the Department
of Health and Human Services will have no immediate impact since it
applies only to new grant applications or renewals that come up
after Oct. 1.
   Even then, federal court orders in Denver and Boston forbid the
rules from applying to the majority of clinics nationwide.
   The Justice Department has appealed those rulings, but they
remain in effect pending further action that likely will reach the
Supreme Court for final determination.
   Scott Swirling, head of the National Family Planning and
Reproductive Health Association, said politics was behind the
announcement.
   ``This is simply a show before the Republican convention to
please the anti-abortion constituency,'' said Swirling, whose
association is an umbrella group for most family planning
organizations.
   Planned Parenthood of America, one of the plaintiffs in the
suits that won the injunctions, is a member of Swirling's
association.
   The HHS announcement came after Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr.,
counsel to President Reagan, sent HHS Secretary Otis R. Bowen a
memo saying the regulations should ``be implemented in all
jurisdictions in which injunctions are not in force.''
   The Reagan administration has been stymied consistently by
Congress in persistent attempts to win legislative changes spelling
out the rules it is attempting to implement administratively.

   Here is a sampling of reviews of the film ``The Last Temptation
of Christ,'' which opened Friday in nine cities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``At the bottom of the controversy is an intense, utterly
sincere, frequently fascinating piece of art by a director for
whom, clearly, the message of Jesus' life has immediacy and
meaning. The film's greatest virtue may be its vision of Jesus'
time; its biggest drawback is the deliberate flatness and banality
of the words used to convey it.'' _ Sheila Benson in the Los
Angeles Times.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It is ``without question one of the most serious, literate,
complex and deeply felt religious films ever made. Brilliantly
directed by Martin Scorsese, this adaption of Nikos Kazantzakis'
novel will surely be discussed and dissected by both theological
scholars and thoughtful moviegoers for years to come. ... The
`Temptation' ... has nothing to do with carnal lust, it is the
temptation to be human. Moviegoers expecting the salacious thrill
show trumpeted by the religious right are going to be very
disappointed.'' _ David Ehrenstein in the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The ``provocative, punishing, weirdly brilliant adaptation of
Nikos Kazantzakis' novel has a feverish intensity. ... It is a work
of great seriousness by one of the country's most gifted
filmmakers. There is also a substantial portion of hooey in it. ...
In Willem Dafoe, Scorsese shows us a Christ who is more an
anguished modern neurotic than a biblical figure, a sort of Hamlet,
and seemingly unfit for the role of Messiah. And he invites us to
think of Him as mad.'' _ Hal Hinson in The Washington Post.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``It is clear that this is a noble, if not totally successful,
attempt to wrestle with profound questions about the age-old
conflict between personal satisfaction and higher ethical values.''
There is ``nothing cinematically salacious or exploitative in the
way Scorsese presents two scenes involving Mary Magdalene.'' _ Judy
Stone in the San Francisco Chronicle.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The controversy surrounding `The Last Temptation of Christ' is
much more interesting than the movie itself. Although emotionally
charged at times, the 2{-hour film drags, leaving the impression of
a project that aimed for epic proportions, but came up short.'' _
Jeff Strickler in the Star Tribune of Minneapolis.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Perhaps no movie could live up to all the hoopla surrounding
this one, but `Last Temptation' is, sad to say, a pretty dull film.
It's long and slow, occasionally reaching hypnotic power in its
images, but more often lapsing into incoherence. Eventually, it's
numbing in its effects.'' _ Deborah J. Kunk in the St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The movie does not even approach a truly radical
interpretation of the life of Christ. ... It may well be one of the
most doctrinaire visions of the life of Christ to make it to 35mm
film in modern times, so much so that without all the controversy,
liberal critics might well have written it off as a `Sunday-school
movie.''' _ William Arnold in The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Today, at long last, protesters and boycotters will have a
chance to actually see `The Last Temptation of Christ.' What they
will see is a film that has the effrontery to insist that Christ
was human _ but isn't that what Christians have claimed all along?
... It may be Scorsese's most courageous, and it is technically
superb, but it is slow and at times heavy going.'' _ Mike McGrady
in New York Newsday.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The only thing sacrilegious about `The Last Temptation of
Christ,' to my mind, is its length, a very long 2 hours and 40
minutes. ... The movie ... is in fact the drama of two men, two
polarities, Jesus and Judas _ Jesus the guilt-ridden Nazareth
carpenter who's always fleeing from and searching for God; Judas
the hard-headed yet impassioned anti-Roman freedom fighter. Of the
two, Judas is (in this film) by far the more interesting.'' _ Jerry
Tallmer in the New York Post.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``It may be the Bible as Kazantzakis interprets it, but it's
also the Bible without poetry. ... The movie is long, with tedious
stretches during which you're more in danger of being bored than
offended. Still, Scorsese ... has always listened to his own muse.
And here he's conducted his search for Jesus in his own way. He's
done it with integrity, reverence and a good deal of cinematic
beauty.'' _ Chris Chase in the New York Daily News.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``What emerges most memorably is (the film's) sense of absolute
conviction, never more palpable than in the final fantasy sequence
that removes Jesus from the cross and creates for him the life of
an ordinary man. Though this episode lasts longer than it should
..., it finally has the mightily affirmative, truly visceral impact
for which the whole film clearly strives. Anyone who questions the
sincerity or seriousness of what Mr. Scorsese has attempted need
only see the film to lay those doubts to rest.'' _ Janet Maslin in
The New York Times.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ```The Last Temptation of Christ' is an admirably serious,
accomplished movie, though it betrays little of the complicated
texture and furious creativity of Scorsese at his best.'' _ David
Kehr in the Chicago Tribune.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``All of the uninformed protest will only serve to fuel
attendance for what turns out to be a very fine, thoughtful and
beautifully performed rumination on Jesus and the difficulty of
living according to his principles.'' _ Gene Siskel in the Chicago
Tribune.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ```The Last Temptation of Christ' is as powerful as it is
controversial _ a work of passion and imagination that stirs the
soul and shakes the intellect.'' _ Lloyd Sachs of the Chicago
Sun-Times.

   Playwright-screenwriter Neil Simon, author of
``The Goodbye Girl,'' has filed for divorce from his wife of more
than a year.
   Simon cited irreconcilable differences for his split with Diane
Lander Simon, according to his petition, filed Friday in Superior
Court. The couple was married Jan. 13, 1987, and separated in June
1988.
   Property rights will be determined later, according to the
petition, filed by attorney Lesley A. Andrus.
   Many of Simon's hit plays also have become popular films,
including, ``Barefoot in the Park,'' ``The Odd Couple,'' ``Brighton
Beach Memoirs'' and ``Plaza Suite.''
   Simon was earlier divorced from actress Marsha Mason, who
starred in ``The Goodbye Girl.''

   When Gene Epstein saw the Trump
Princess dock a few feet from his yacht, he never dreamed the giant
$30 million yacht owned by real estate developer Donald Trump would
be a magnet for gawkers at his own boat.
   Epstein and owners of neighboring yachts at an Atlantic City
marina grouse that Trump isn't concerned about the hordes of
tourists who not only stare at the six decks of the Princess but
peer into nearby portholes and in some cases even climb aboard.
   Trump says that the state marina, which he renovated, is open to
all.
   ``What has happened is that the Princess has become the hottest
piece of property in the country, and thousands of people are
coming to see it,'' he said Friday. ``People are allowed to walk on
a public dock.''
   ``My privacy is completely invaded,'' said Epstein, who is
docked four boats away from the Princess. ``People are literally
sticking their heads into my boat.
   ``Trump has the marina security guards standing by his boat, but
they don't stop people from climbing on our boats.''
   Trump, in a lease agreement with the state, invested $20 million
to fix up the once deteriorated marina that faces his Trump Castle
Hotel Casino.
   ``It was falling down, and now it's the most beautiful marina in
the world,'' he said. ``These people are unhappy because the rates
will increase substantially, commensurate with the quality of the
marina.''

   Mayor Sophie Masloff's choice of a slogan for
her city clean-up campaign, ``Sophie's Choice,'' has certainly
attracted attention, but not of the kind she wanted.
   The slogan brings to mind a William Styron book and film of the
same name, which told the story of a Polish woman in a World War II
concentration camp forced by the Nazis to choose which of her two
children would be killed.
   ``I love Sophie dearly. I wish she had chosen another slogan by
virtue of the fact it can raise an issue,'' said Richard Marcovitz,
rabbi at Congregation B'nai Israel.
   ``I think it was in bad taste,'' added Councilwoman Michelle
Madoff.
   The mayor defended her choice Thursday. ``It's just a catch
phrase. That's why I chose it, not for any significance at all,''
she said.
   ``This Sophie's Choice might not win an Academy Award, but it's
my No. 1 priority,'' said Mrs. Masloff.
   The clean-up campaign includes new street sweeping machines,
more trash containers, repaving 70 miles of city streets this year
and cleaning every vacant city lot by October.

   Buddy Miles, well known in the
1960s as the drummer in Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsies, is enjoying
another day in the sun.
   This time he's the voice of the lead singer in the Post Raisin
Bran TV commercials, which feature a quartet of singing, animated
clay raisins.
   The new wrinkle in Miles' career came while he was working on an
album with Carlos Santana, said the 40-year-old entertainer.
   The Raisin Bran commercials spawned a million-selling album of
oldies remakes with Miles singing the lead. But the head raisin is
still working the road.
   His refurbished seven-piece Buddy Miles Express is doing a
series of Southern California shows and the Motown hit ``Heard It
Through The Grapevine,'' sung by the television raisins, is part of
the repertoire.
   ``Why not? It comes off of a platinum album, and right now
people are really into listening to that kind of music. Plus,
they're great songs,'' he said.

   Football star Mark Gastineau and actress
Brigitte Nielsen called a full-scale press conference to announce
they plan a small-scale wedding with only their ``true friends'' as
guests.
   The date will be sometime this winter, as soon as his divorce is
final.
   ``We want something very romantic,'' said Nielsen, 25, recently
divorced from actor Sylvester Stallone.
   Gastineau, a New York Jets defensive end, has yet to sever his
marriage to his first wife, Lisa, a model, from whom he separated
in 1986.
   Gastineau and Nielsen confirmed last month's reports that as a
symbol of their eternal love, they had their names tatooed onto
each others buttocks.
   ``It means I really love this person and I'm going to be with
her for eternity,'' said Gastineau, 31, who is attending Jets
training camp at Hofstra University in the nearby Long Island
community of Hempstead.
   ``I can really call this true love,'' said the bride-to-be,
showing off her ring, featuring diamonds in the shape of a nine.
Gastineau's jersey number is 99. ``I am the happiest I have ever
been.''
   ``We want lots of kids, 10 of them,'' declared Nielsen, who said
her movie career will be secondary to ``being with Mark.'' Each has
a child by a previous marriage.

<HEAD>Ex-Navy Gunner Says His Memory Of War Incident Differs With Bush's</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHESHIRE, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Navy gunner who says he saw
George Bush being shot down on a World War II bombing run says his
memory differs from the vice president's recollection of what
happened over the South Pacific on Sept. 2, 1944.
   Chester Mierzejewski, 68, a retired foreman of an aircraft
factory, said Friday that he wonders whether the then-Navy pilot,
and soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee, could have saved
two crewmates.
   One of those who went down with the plane in the South Pacific,
radioman John Delaney, was his friend, Mierzejewski said. But he
added he has ``no animosity'' toward Bush and calls him ``a very
nice guy.''
   The New York Post, which first reported his story, said no one
other than Mierzejewski claims to have seen Bush's plane be hit and
go down. Mierzejewski held a news conference outside his home after
his account appeared in the newspaper Friday.
   Bush has spoken of the war-time downing in interviews and has
recalled his combat record in campaign speeches.
   Mierzejewski said he witnessed the incident as a turret gunner
in a plane ahead of Bush's. He said he only reluctantly agreed,
after being prodded by a neighbor, to discuss the case in public.
   He said he wrote Bush in March to urge him to check with
advisers and make sure his recollection of the event was factual,
but got no response.
   ``I do not want to see your campaign hurt by statements you may
make regarding all that occurred when your aircraft was hit,'' he
wrote, saying he did not intend to dispute Bush in public.
   He did not accuse Bush of purposely distorting what happened,
saying the passage of time sometimes affects memories, and added
that ``from what I have heard you state, this may be the case
regarding your recollections of being shot down.''
   Bush's press office issued a statement Thursday saying he has
recounted the incident many times and ``to suggest that his account
is inaccurate is absurd.'' A telephone call Friday, seeking more
comment, was not returned.
   Mierzejewski, attached to the same squadron as Bush, was a
turret gunner in the squadron commander's plane during a
tight-formation bombing raid against a Japanese radar installation
in the South Pacific.
   Bush has said the plane was in smoke and the wings were burning
when he bailed out of his bomber, leaving behind two crewmates
presumed dead. Bush was picked up by a Navy submarine.
   Mierzejewski said he was only about 100 feet from the plane Bush
was flying, could see him in the cockpit, and ``I saw him get hit.
As he got over the water, and it began slowing down and losing
altitude, he bailed out.''
   While he said he saw an initial puff of smoke, he said it
quickly disappeared. After that, ``I didn't see any noticeable
smoke'' and ``I saw no fire,'' Mierzejewski said.
   He said he was very upset after the incident because he wondered
why Bush did not try to make a water landing which, if successful,
would have given the crew about two minutes to escape.
   ``If there was any doubt at all in his mind or any possibility
at all that these kids were alive, by attempting a water landing he
could have saved the people in the plane,'' he said.
   Mierzejewski said that a month after the downing he saw Bush and
that Bush told him: ``I knew those two were dead because I called
the back room and there was no answer.''
   In a television interview last December, Bush said one of his
crewmates had also apparently gotten out of the plane and that he
believed the other man died inside the craft.
   ``I felt I had to give him the benefit of the doubt (about what
happened) until he kept changing his versions,'' said Mierzejewski.
   An intelligence report on the loss of Bush's plane reported that
``smoke and flame'' engulfed Bush's engine, according to the Post.
It said the report was signed by the squadron commander, Douglas
Melvin, and a now-dead intelligence officer. Melvin is hospitalized
with Parkinson's disease and could not be interviewed, the Post
reported.
   Squadron members interviewed by the Post disagreed about whether
Mierzejewski would have had the best view of Bush's plane.
   Mierzejewski said he is an independent voter and has not decided
whether to vote for Bush for president. Larry Herman, a neighbor
who arranged for Mierzejewski to be interviewed by the Post, said
he is a Democrat but is not politically active. ``There's nothing
political about it,'' said Herman.

   Honduras' foreign minister accused
the United States of shirking its responsibility in bringing peace
to Central America, and he said the Reagan administration should
work with the Soviet Union on a plan to end the region's wars.
   Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, offered Friday to hold new
peace talks with U.S.-supported Contra rebels either in Managua or
Washington. He said the government was ready to meet rebels in
Managua on Aug. 26-29.
   Adolfo Calero, a rebel leader, rejected Managua as the site for
talks but did not address the possibility of talks in Washington.
He demanded that Ortega attend any future negotiating sessions.
   Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras said the United
States' and Soviet Union's backing of warring parties in Central
America threatens the security of his nation, a key U.S. ally.
   ``The United States must assume responsibility as a
negotiator,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview Friday.
``There must be negotiations with the four Central American
democracies, the United States with Nicaragua, and the United
States with the Soviet Union.''
   His reference to democracies meant the U.S.-allied governments
in Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Honduras.
   Contreras said Washington should develop a Central American
demilitarization plan with the Soviet Union.
   In El Salvador, the Soviets support guerrillas of the
Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which has
waged an insurgency since 1980 against the U.S.-backed government
there.
   In Nicaragua, the United States has financed rebels, known as
Contras, since 1981 in an attempt to topple the leftist Sandinista
government, which is backed by the Soviet Union.
   Hundreds of thousands of refugees have sought refuge from both
wars in neighboring Honduras, and fighting occasionally has spilled
over into the country. In addition, the Contras have maintained
base camps in Honduras.
   About 1,000 Nicaraguan rebels in recent weeks have crossed into
Honduras in search of food and supplies distributed by the U.S.
Agency for International Development. They joined an estimated
250,000 Nicaraguan and El Salvadoran refugees already here.
   Contreras said he would rather see the Contras fed along the
border than roaming the interior. ``They are armed,'' he said.
   The foreign minister said superpower military assistance to the
region's rebels threatens his country.
   ``Every time the American Congress approves aid for the Contras,
the Soviet Union thinks it is justified in providing more to
Nicaragua,'' Contreras said.
   ``The net result is that Honduras, politically, socially,
economically and from the security point of view, is worse off in
1988 than we were in 1977,'' he said. ``Our main concern is
security. We need to re-establish the military equilibrium.''
   The U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved $27 million in
humanitarian aid for the Contras, with the possibility of $16
million in military supplies later.
   The Honduran armed forces total about 25,000. Nicaragua's army
numbers about 80,000, and the Salvadoran military totals more than
50,000.
   Honduras has allowed tens of thousands of American troops to
stage military maneuvers in its territory.
   U.S. military and economic assistance to Honduras increased from
less than $10 million before 1979 to about $200 million in 1988,
the foreign minister said. But he said the aid had not eased
Honduran security concerns.
   ``We allow the military maneuvers. They practice and they leave
and Honduras stays the same,'' Contreras said. ``On the other hand,
the Soviet goods come (to Nicaragua) and stay.''
   In remarks broadcast by the rebels' clandestine Radio
Liberacion, Calero set a number of conditions before the Contras
would return to the bargaining table, including the reopening of
Nicaragua's Roman Catholic station Radio Catolica and radio news
programs shut down by the Sandinistas in July.
   Calero also demanded the release of more than 40 jailed
opposition figures. He rejected the idea of holding peace talks in
Managua, but he did not mention Ortega's suggestion that they could
be held in Washington.
   Ortega called for renewed talks while on an official visit to
Ecuador. He also criticized the U.S. Congress for approving new aid
to the rebels, calling it an act of ``aggression.''

   Rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government fled a provincial stronghold for Honduras,
where the U.S. government is feeding hundreds of refugees from the
nearly 7-year-old war.
   Col. Enrique Bermudez, one of seven members of the Contra
directorate, said 25 fighters and 750 civilian supporters trekked
from central Chontales province for a month and crossed the steep
mountains and the Coco River separating Honduras and Nicaragua.
   He said Thursday night the exodus happened because ``we can't
feed the people there'' and added: ``It's better for them to leave
because the Sandinistas would harass them. We protect those
people.''
   Visitors ferried to the Honduran-Nicaraguan border by the U.S.
Agency For International Development, or AID, quoted some of the
Nicaraguan refugees as saying Contra leaders ordered them to leave.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Anne Sigmund said AID was providing
food to about 300 refugees. ``That's the number we know crossed. We
understand more are coming,'' she said.
   CIA supply flights to the Contras inside Nicaragua ended Feb.
29, when a U.S. military assistance package ran out. The Honduran
government granted permission for the AID supplies to be
distributed to the refugees.
   Contras and Sandinistas estimated earlier this year that about
3,500 Contra fighters were in Chontales and receiving air drops of
basic food and military supplies. About 6,500 rebels are believed
to be along the Honduran border seeking supplies from AID.
   The Contra leadership is asking for renewed military aid from
Washington, saying peace negotiations with the Sandinistas are
deadlocked. The Senate on Wednesday approved $27 million in
humanitarian aid.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, on an official visit to
Ecuador, on Friday called approval of the aid package an act of
``aggression'' and proposed new peace talks with the rebels be held
Aug. 26-29.
   Adolfo Calero, a rebel leader, on Friday rejected Managua as the
site for peace talks and demanded Ortega personally attend any
future negotiating sessions.
   The Contras and the Sandinistas signed a cease-fire pact March
23 to seek a negotiated settlement to the civil war. Peace talks
broke down June 9 and a unilateral government extension of the
cease-fire ends Aug. 30.

<HEAD>Dukakis Takes Weekend Off After Attacking Reagan On Two Fronts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis today began a weekend away
from the campaign trail as he unveiled his first television
advertising for the general election in high-stakes Texas and
California.
   The Democratic presidential nominee traveled to Cape Cod Friday
night after campaign stops in Virginia and Florida, where he
denounced Reagan administration anti-drug efforts, defense
priorities and economic policies.
   The new ad, to air this weekend in the two states expected to be
critical in the November election, is part of an effort by the
Dukakis staff to raise the candidate's profile in advance of next
week's Republican convention.
   On Friday, the economy was at the top of the nominee's agenda,
with Dukakis saying Reagan's deficit spending is responsible for
the news Friday that inflation was picking up steam and for an
increase this week in interest rates.
   Dukakis, in Jacksonville, Fla., told a waterfront rally the
increase in the prime rate to 10 percent was ``the consequence of
eight years of not paying our bills. ... It's an irresponsibility
tax.''
   ``We deserve an explanation from the Republicans at that
convention about what they're doing to the American people,'' he
said.
   The Massachusetts governor said the next president will have to
deal with the deficit immediately if interest rates are to drop. He
stood by his promise to raise taxes only as a last resort after
making spending cuts, trying to increase the rate of economic
growth and collecting unpaid taxes.
   Dukakis said a higher prime rate would impose unfair hardships
on American families, farmers and businesses and increase the
federal deficit by $15 billion because of higher interest on the
U.S. debt.
   ``As we all know, sooner or later the bill collector comes to
the door,'' Dukakis told a breakfast rally in Richmond, Va., before
heading to Florida.
   The ad being broadcast this weekend is the first new spot the
Dukakis campaign has aired since the candidate was nominated last
month in Atlanta.
   The airing is in states shaping up as two major battlegrounds
for Dukakis and Vice President George Bush. California leads the
nation with 47 electoral votes and Texas has 29.
   The 60-second piece features several clips of Dukakis'
acceptance speech at the Democratic convention and credits Dukakis
with helping create more than 400,000 jobs in Massachusetts.
   ``It wasn't a miracle,'' the narrator says. ``It was
leadership.''
   The ad was scheduled to run in Houston and California's cities
of Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno.
   Dukakis also will campaign during the final days of the
Republican convention, with stops tentatively scheduled in Florida,
Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas.
   He was introduced by Gov. Gerald Baliles, who said he disagreed
with Dukakis' promise to scrap plans for two supercarrier task
forces, which would be built at the Newport News, Va., shipyard.
   ``Governor Dukakis and I may debate the individual choices we
must make, but in his commitment to the security of this nation, I
have no doubts, no reservations, and no hesitations,'' Baliles said.

   Democratic lawmakers say departing Attorney
General Edwin Meese III's order calling for independent counsels to
investigate members of Congress suspected of criminal conduct is
unnecessary and vindictive.
   Meese, in his final act Friday after 3{ controversial years at
the Justice Department, said he wanted to ensure that legislators
and top executive branch officials be treated equally under the law.
   But legislators pointed out that Meese has established a system
with crucial differences for members of Congress.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Meese had a good idea but he
``messed it up'' by stipulating that the attorney general _ not a
court _ would appoint the independent counsel.
   ``It's fine to have special independent counsels prosecute
members of Congress; in fact, that option is available now,'' said
Levin. ``But attorneys general ought to be able to use
court-appointed counsels and local U.S. attorneys.... It is that
authority Meese has attempted to eliminate today.''
   Meese, who has been the subject of two separate investigations
by independent counsels since he came to Washington as counselor to
President Reagan in 1981, said his action was not meant as a
parting shot at his critics in Congress.
   Instead, he said, ``Having all high officials covered by the
same general procedures makes good sense.''
   Top officials of the executive branch are covered by the 1978
Ethics in Government Act, which was designed to prevent any
conflict of interest charges in investigations of high-ranking
government employees.
   Members of Congress are not included specifically in the law
under which a three-judge panel names the independent counsel after
a preliminary investigation by the Justice Department.
   Under Meese's order, if the attorney general receives specific
and credible information indicating that a senator or congressman
has violated criminal law, he must launch a preliminary
investigation of up to 90 days.
   Based on the results of the preliminary probe, the attorney
general either can close the case or appoint an independent counsel
to investigate. The court would not make the appointment under
Meese's order.
   A Justice Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the order would require the attorney general to
follow these procedures if allegations were made against a
legislator. But Meese said that if the legislator was the subject
of a related criminal probe, that could take precedence.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of a House Judiciary
subcommittee that reviews the ethics law, said Meese's order was
unnecessary because the act already allows the attorney general to
call for a special prosecutor.
   Frank said the order, signed after Congress had recessed until
after Labor Day, was a ``vindictive and petty act by a man who has
not shown any class since he came here.... One last mark of
irresponsible bitterness of a guy who messed up.''
   Meese said his authority to impose the rule derived from the
attorney general's power to appoint special prosecutors, as was
done in the Watergate scandal.
   He said he waited to sign the order until his successor, former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard L. Thornburgh, was approved by the Senate
on Thursday so as not to cause Thornburgh any problems at his
confirmation hearings.
   Meese said he discussed the regulation with Thornburgh, and, ``I
believe he agrees with it.'' Thornburgh, who was sworn in at the
White House on Friday, could rescind the rule at any time.
   Earlier in the administration, Meese sought to have the ethics
act declared unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court upheld it June
29. The Justice Department argued the law usurps powers granted the
executive branch under the Constitution.
   Meese, 56, is leaving the government to serve as a distinguished
fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think
tank, and at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in
California. He also intends to hit the lecture circuit.
   While at the White House, Meese was investigated by independent
counsel Jacob Stein on allegations that he may have used his office
for personal gain. Stein brought no charges against Meese.
   More recently, independent counsel James McKay investigated
Meese on allegations of conflict of interest and looked into his
relationship with E. Robert Wallach, a lawyer who has been indicted
in a case involving Wedtech Corp., a defense contractor in the
Bronx, N.Y.
   McKay said last month that prosecution of Meese was unwarranted,
although the attorney general probably violated tax and
conflict-of-interest laws. Meese harshly criticized McKay's
comments and said the special counsel's report vindicated him.

   U.S. officials say the Reagan administration
will not replace the ambassador who was expelled by Nicaraguan
authorities, but instead plans to send Kenneth Skoug, head of the
State Department's office of Cuban affairs, to run the embassy.
   As embassy charge d'affairs, Skoug would not require Senate
confirmation to replace Ambassador Richard Melton, one of eight
U.S. envoys expelled from Managua last month.
   The State Department said Friday that Nicaragua is withholding
approval of the names the U.S. has submitted as replacements for
the diplomats who were ordered from the country.
   Department officials said refusal to approve the envoys
apparently was in retaliation for the U.S. expulsion of Nicaraguan
Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann, who served as chief envoy to both the
United States and the Organization of American States.

   Sara Lee Corp. will pay a $725,000 civil
penalty to settle charges that it violated federal laws by aiding
the Arab boycott of Israel.
   G. Philip Hughes, assistant secretary of commerce for export

   Sara Lee agreed to the payment, without admitting or denying
guilt, shortly before the scheduled Aug. 1 start of a trial before

   The department said Sara Lee, in connection with an attempt to
register trademarks in Kuwait, furnished information about the

the names and places of incorporation of U.S. and foreign
subsidiaries. Such information is used by Arab League countries to
make blacklist decisions in its boycott of Israel, the department

   Heavy rains lashed this desert capital
today, exacerbating flooding that left 1.5 million people homeless
and hampering efforts to distribute emergency supplies.
   The rains began about midnight and created huge pools of water
in the streets of downtown Khartoum, a city of 4 million. The
airport was closed, and the Nile was rising. The downpour continued
through the night.
   Relief agencies and donor nations began airlifting blankets,
tents, food, medical and other supplies to Khartoum on Friday, 48
hours after a storm dumped six times as much rain on the city as it
received in all of 1987.
   But residents of some settlements say they haven't received any
aid and are desperate.
   Life was slowly returning to normal in some parts of Khartoum,
but high water and poor management prevented distribution of relief
supplies to hard-hit areas, the Akhbar el-Yom newspaper, a weekly
in Cairo, Egypt, reported today.
   The Cairo daily newspaper al-Ahram said hundreds of tons of
supplies were in Khartoum, waiting to be distributed.
   The rains that swamped Khartoum and other cities in eastern and
northern Sudan killed at least 39 people and caused $200 million in
damage, Maj. Gen. el-Fateh Abdoun, a city official, was quoted as
saying by Akhbar el-Yom.
   Some of those hardest hit are nearly 1 million people who fled
drought and civil war in Sudan's rural areas to seek refuge in
squatter settlements ringing Khartoum.
   One such settlement, Marzouk, was reduced to a sprawling
collection of crumbling walls and collapsed hovels.
   Residents of Marzouk, west of Khartoum across the Blue Nile, a
major tributary of the Nile, said they had seen little aid.
   ``We need tents and plastic sheets,'' said Abdullahim Idris
Kody, 32. He said his family had slept in the open air since the
floods destroyed his two-room hut.
   He said they had received no food or medicine and that children
in Marzouk were beginning to develop intestinal problems and coughs.
   Sudanese officials have warned that the country could be further
endangered by the annual flooding of the Nile River in the coming
weeks.
   More than 83,000 houses have been destroyed in Khartoum, leaving
more than 1.5 million people homeless, the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency reported. Many residents have been without electricity
and fresh drinking water.
   Journalists touring Marzouk encountered no one who had received
any emergency aid and saw no substantial relief operation for the
settlement's 15,000 people.
   Several soldiers stood outside six orange army tents, where a
young woman said she was handing out less than a 2.2 pounds of
wheat flour per family daily, in addition to supplementary foods
that included sardines, dates and sugar.
   But no distribution was under way, and residents complained the
rations were being distributed along political lines only to
``special families,'' not the camp as a whole.
   Information about the scope of the relief operation throughout
Khartoum was scarce, and it was not possible to determine
immediately whether the situation at Marzouk was typical of other
settlements.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government has tried to discourage
the settlements by denying them social services and forbidding them
to dig wells.
   Abdul Mohammed, of the Sudan Council of Churches, said local
non-governmental organizations were trying to care for the
displaced people but lacked staff and supplies.
   Most of the assistance received so far has come primarily from
Arab nations in the form of government-to-government aid.
   On Friday, however, Western deliveries began to pick up with the
arrival of Dutch, American and UNICEF cargo planes carrying
supplies earmarked for non-governmental agencies, such as the Sudan
Council of Churches.
   But Mohammed said those groups could handle only 15 percent of
the displaced population's needs and would be able to help only the
most desperate.
   Western donor countries, concerned about the distribution of the
relief aid, met Friday under U.N. auspices to draft a letter to the
government reminding it of their need to be able to account for the
aid.
   ``The concern now is that (the aid) is getting through,'' said
Bryan Wannop, the U.N. emergency relief coordinator in Khartoum.
   Cairo newspapers said Friday that Sudan state television had
shown the prime minister touring flood-hit areas in Khartoum and
then complaining that supplies were not reaching flood victims
speedily and in sufficient quantities. He laid the blame partly on
lack of coordination among government agencies.

   Amid the hills of rural Pennsylvania,
where the Holocaust's horrors seem long ago and far away, a Polish
parish is converting a church basement into a museum evoking the
concentration camp where the ``Saint of Auschwitz'' died 47 years
ago Sunday.
   ``I lived through the cruelties and atrocities of World War II,
and I would like the people in this country to have some idea what
transpired,'' said Stanislaw Dziob, 55, an engineer from Krakow,
Poland.
   He and another visitor from Poland are transforming the basement
of St. Thomas Roman Catholic Church into a museum made to look and
feel like the concentration camp where St. Maximilian Kolbe died.
   While honoring all those killed by the Nazis, the museum
spotlights the Polish victims, especially Kolbe, a Franciscan friar
who volunteered to die so a fellow prisoner at Auschwitz might live.
   The 47-year-old priest, No. 16670 to his Nazi torturers, died by
lethal injection on Aug. 14, 1941. He was declared a saint by Pope
John Paul II on Oct. 10, 1982. A week later, a shrine to the saint
was dedicated in the shadow of St. Thomas, an anchor of this
ethnic, former coal mining town 50 miles south of Pittsburgh.
   ``So often in the United States, people speak of the
extermination of 6 million Jews, quite forgetting the extermination
of (millions of) Poles,'' Dziob said, speaking softly in Polish.
Many of the Jews killed by the Nazis were Poles as well.
   Busloads of Roman Catholics from Pennsylvania and neighboring
states, most of them Polish-Americans, regularly descend on the
shrine, a small, stone structure topped with barbed wire and
holding the ashes of Holocaust victims.
   Many visitors are moved to tears when they hear the church's
pastor, the Rev. Lawrence Hoppe, tell of the supreme sacrifice made
by the frail, tubercular priest from Zdunska Wola, Poland.
   Even though it is incomplete, visitors also can visit the
museum. Its dedication is planned for Aug. 14, 1989. Unlike the
shrine, the museum is meant to reach beyond religion, according to
Hoppe.
   ``I see the shrine as a place to come and pray, to develop some
piety and some closer relationship with God,'' said Hoppe, 54, who
is of Polish descent and translated for his Polish visitors. ``The
museum I see as more intellectual, academic.''
   Built in six cubicles lining two walls of the dimly lit
basement, the museum is also more brutal to the senses. To lessen
the shock, Hoppe and others plan to increase the intensity of the
exhibits over time.
   ``We would not shock the public too much at once, (rather)
prepare them, bring people into a theme of suffering, a theme of
the terribly horrendous effects of war,'' said Waclaw Rybotycki,
42, an artist and architect at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow.
   It is called the Expo Museum _ ``expo'' meaning to expose the
cruelty of the Nazis _ and has the blessing of Francis Gajowniczek,
86, the Pole whose life was spared by Kolbe's martyrdom.
   Dziob and Rybotycki, who began planning the museum with Hoppe's
predecessor, arrived last month from Poland.
   They brought with them 70 items for a display depicting the life
of St. Maximilian and the atrocities at Auschwitz in Poland, the
most notorious concentration camp. They received help in compiling
the collection from the National Museum in Krakow, the museum at
Auschwitz and the Franciscan community founded by Kolbe in 1927
outside Warsaw.
   The displays will include recreations of death-camp cells,
photographs, tombstone-shaped plaques, an eternal flame and an oil
painting by Rybotycki showing St. Maximilian about to die.
   Edith Stein, a Jewish-born Carmelite nun from Poland who died in
1942 in Auschwitz's gas chambers, will be honored, and there will
be scenes from the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals.
   A stone Wall of Honor will commemorate U.S. servicemen who
liberated the concentration camps.
   Despite the despair, the overriding theme of the museum is the
struggle between good and evil and love's ultimate triumph over
hate.
   ``You cannot have peace unless you have justice,'' said Hoppe,
who hopes the museum and shrine, through St. Maximilian's example,
can help ``prevent World War III, World War IV and any future world
wars.''

<HEAD>Sleepy Reagan Ads Pulled After Callers Besiege Burger Chain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eating breakfast may be good for one's
health, but using a photo of a snoozing President Reagan to make
the point is risky business, a fast food chain learned.
   Full-page ads featuring the photo were pulled from five
newspapers this week after the Burgerville chain received dozens of
calls from people who thought they made fun of Reagan, said Pat
Klinger, vice president of Burgerville USA's parent company,
Holland Inc.
   The ads depicted the president with his eyes closed and wearing
headphones. The picture, obtained from NBC-TV, was taken when
Reagan was attending a meeting at Bonn, West Germany.
   ``You can usually tell when someone skips breakfast,'' said the
ads, which extolled the nutritional benefits of a breakfast like
those available at Burgerville.
   Twenty-five calls was all it took, said Klinger, who yanked the
ad after a one-day run in the Columbian in Vancouver, the Oregonian
in Portland, the Salem, Ore., Statesman-Journal and the Dalles,
Ore., Chronicle.
   Klinger managed to stop the ad before it ran in the weekly
Monmouth, Ore., Sun-Enterprise.
   Burgerville, with 31 outlets in Oregon and Washington, often
uses eye-catching advertisements to compete with national
restaurant chains, but Klinger said there were limits to the
attention he hoped to draw.
   ``We're not in the business of offending or upsetting people,''
he said. ``The ad became something we didn't intend. It became a
political ad and we pulled it.''
   Ron Rasmussen was one of those newspaper readers who got upset.
   ``I was so mad, I could've spit bullets,'' said the former Clark
County Republican chairman. ``It was extremely discourteous to our
president to put that ad in. I'm 58, and I could fall asleep in a
meeting.''

   Democratic vice presidential nominee
Lloyd Bentsen is using a Southern strategy _ a tour of south Texas
_ to help secure his regional standing, especially among Hispanics.
   The Texas senator flew here for a speech Friday night then
planned stops in Kingsville, Laredo, Brownsville and Houston before
the weekend was over.
   Hispanic voters can ``tip the balance of power,'' Bentsen told
1,200 people Friday night at a fund-raising dinner for the
Southwest Voter Registration Project, a group which promotes
greater political participation by Hispanics.
   The crowd chuckled when Bentsen said, ``I didn't come to San
Antonio to give a political speech.'' He then made a pitch for
himself and presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``When you elect the right people you get the right policies,''
he said. ``I happen to believe that Mike Dukakis is the right man
to be president of the United States.''
   Bentsen made no mention in his speech of President Reagan's
nomination earlier this week of Lauro F. Cavazos of Texas Tech to
become the new secretary of education.
   But he told reporters he didn't think Reagan's move would win
the Hispanic vote for Vice President George Bush, the certain GOP
nominee at next week's Republican convention in New Orleans.
   ``That was so apparent, I don't think it will have any
influence,'' Bentsen said. ``As far as getting any political
mileage out of it, I don't think it will. A three-month appointment
is not going to be that impressive to Hispanics.''
   Bentsen has said he received 90 percent of the Hispanic vote in
his last Senate race in 1982.
   Hours before Bentsen arrived in San Antonio, he began airing
television ads sponsored by his campaign for re-election to the
Senate. Under Texas law, Bentsen can seek both the vice presidency
and re-election to his Senate seat, and he is doing just that.
   The Dukakis campaign was also putting ads on television in Texas
and California this weekend. Combined with Bentsen's campaign
effort, it amounted to unusually intense activity from the
Democrats on the eve of the Republican convention.
   ``Texas is a real battleground. That's obvious,'' Bentsen told
reporters.
   Dukakis planned to join Bentsen in Texas late next week for some
joint appearances, including a spot at the ranch that belonged to
the late President Lyndon B. Johnson.
   Bentsen planned to stay in Texas through next Saturday, except
for a brief trip to Little Rock, Ark., early in the week. A stop in
Florida was scheduled on the way back to Washington, D.C., next
Saturday night.

<HEAD>Study Finds AIDS Virus Tricks Healthy Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New research provides a possible explanation for
one of the mysteries of AIDS: how a few infected cells lead to the
downfall of the body's entire immune system.
   The research also suggests serious obstacles may stand in the
way of finding a vaccine to keep people from catching the AIDS
virus.
   ``I wouldn't say impossible, but it's very unlikely that one
would be able to develop a successful vaccine,'' said Dr. Ellis L.
Reinherz, senior author of the study published in Friday's issue of
the journal Cell.
   The research, conducted at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in
Boston, shows the AIDS virus may destroy defenses against disease
by tricking the body into launching an attack against the healthy
cells of the immune system.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, called the research ``interesting,
important news.''
   ``It's teaching us what we need to do to target our vaccine
development,'' he said. ``It's not really good news or bad news.
You have to learn what's going on before you can do anything.''
   The research, conducted principally by Robert F. Siliciano,
tested the T cells of people who had never been exposed to the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.
   T cells perform many duties in the body's constant warfare
against germs. Some hunt down infected cells and kill them, while
others churn out chemicals that help fine-tune the body's immune
response. One type of regulator known as helper T cells is a
primary target of the AIDS virus.
   Molecules called CD3 receptors are carried by T cells and serve
as their eyes in the search for microscopic invaders. The
researchers found that everyone has a few T cells with CD3
receptors capable of spotting the outer coat of the AIDS virus.
However, the cells recognize only small chunks of this coat, and
the chunks vary widely.
   As a result, no single bit of the AIDS virus could serve as a
vaccine for everyone.
   When the T cells recognize a piece of virus as foreign, they
produce many copies of themselves. These become constantly prowling
watchdogs, searching for this single fragment of virus. If they see
it again, they quickly mount an attack and kill it.
   However, the AIDS virus rapidly mutates, changing the chemical
shape of its outer coat. The researchers found that if there is
even a minor change in the piece of coat that they look for, the T
cells will fail to recognize it as their foe.
   Reinherz said the new research suggests that the AIDS virus
kills by sparking an attack by the body on its own blood cells.
   The virus is powerfully attracted to another spot, known as the
CD4 receptor, that is found on several kinds of cells throughout
the body but is especially plentiful on helper T cells.
   Reinherz said that when the virus takes over a cell, it often
forces it to churn out pieces of virus coat but not entire viruses.
These pieces of coat are scooped up by other T cells, which remain
healthy and uninfected.
   Once one of these coat-carrying T cells recognizes a disease it
is targeted for, such as a herpes virus, it springs to life. At
this point, the innocent T cell gives the appearance of being
infected with the AIDS virus, even though it is not, and other
vigilant T cells swoop down and kill it.
   In this way, Reinherz said, the body loses its disease-fighting
T cells at the precise moment it needs them, resulting in severe
immune suppression.

<HEAD>Obscure Royal Relative Claims His Past</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DOBBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hitherto unknown relative of Queen Elizabeth II
has placed one foot out of obscurity, claiming his father was the
product of an illicit love affair between a dashing aristocrat and
a lady-in-waiting, a blueblood chronicler says.
   The relative is a 49-year-old engineer whose first name is
Anthony. He lives with his wife and two teen-age children in a
modest three-bedroom house in a suburb of Manchester in northern
England. But that's all he wants the public to know.
   Anthony says he is the queen's second cousin, once removed, and
according to Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's
Peerage, ``he is her closest illegitimate documented relative.''
   Brooks-Baker said Anthony's grandfather was Charles Bowes-Lyon,
a first cousin of the queen's mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   ``Anthony wants his family to be included in Burke's Peerage
along with his noble ancestors,'' Brooks-Baker said. ``He wants his
children to be received by the Bowes-Lyon family.''
   He stepped forward when Burke's Peerage, known as the blueblood
bible, announced a year ago that it intended to begin listing the
illegitimate offspring of nobility and royalty in future editions.
   Burke's Peerage authenticated Anthony's royal links through his
birth certificate, letters and photographs, but respected his wish
to remain anonymous.
   Anthony feared public recognition might destroy his family's
quiet lifestyle and has asked to be listed as ``The Unknown
Royal,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   Britain's tabloid newspapers have offered him up to $85,000 for
exclusive rights to his story, but Anthony has refused,
Brooks-Baker said.
   ``He has refused all monies,'' Brooks-Baker said. ``He is an
unbelievably shy man and is far from rich, but he has no problems
financially.''
   In 1908, Bowes-Lyon, a second lieutenant in the British army,
``fell passionately in love with this attractive woman who was a
sort of companion to his aunt'' at the family's stately home,
Ridley Hall, in northeast England, Brooks-Baker said.
   A year later, they had a child and asked permission to marry,
``but a marriage between somebody of that station and a
lady-in-waiting was really out of the question,'' he said.
   Bowes-Lyon was sent to Canada for three years ``to recover from
this great love,'' and the mother and child went to live at her
family's home in Cheshire in northwest England, he said.
   The child, Charles, was registered as a Lindsay, the
lieutenant's mother's maiden surname.
   Brooks-Baker said Bowes-Lyon's love for the woman never faded,
and that he possibly planned to marry her. But World War I
intervened, and he was killed in battle in France on Oct. 23, 1914.
   Illegitimate children ``cannot claim their full share of an
inheritance'' but the Bowes-Lyon family ``looked after the child,''
Brooks-Baker said.
   They paid for his schooling and, when he turned 18, sent his
mother 600 pounds (then about $2,700) in Canadian railway stocks to
help him set up in business.
   ``That is one of the best examples I know of the aristocratic
tradition of accepting illegitimacy in an understanding and
Christian way,'' Brooks-Baker said.
   Charles later married and had a son, Anthony. He ended up a
shopkeeper in the English Midlands, where he died in 1976.
   Brooks-Baker said the Bowes-Lyon family gathered Friday to
discuss Anthony's claim to his past and ``there's no question about
anyone denying it.''

   Floods caused by typhoons and torrential rains
have killed 1,406 people this year and caused $1.2 billion damage,
the Central Flood Control Headquarters said today.
   Zhou Zhenxian, an official at the headquarters, said areas along
tributaries of the Yangtze River in southwest China, the coastal
province of Zhejiang, and Guangdong province in the south have been
particularly hard hit by the annual summer floods.
   Zhou said that as of Aug. 12, 1,406 people had lost their lives
and 17.3 million acres of farmland had been flooded.
   But Zhou said the death toll from floods was not high for this
time of year. He said 1,563 had died as of mid-August last year,
and 2,385 were killed in the same period in 1986.

   The government today announced that 36

prison to mark the 43rd anniversary of the liberation of the Korean
Peninsula from Japan.
   The Justice Ministry said the dissidents will be released Sunday
on parole, along with 1,343 other non-political criminals.
   Aug. 15 marks the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the
Korean Peninsula from 36 years of Japanese occupation.
   In June, the government released 46 political prisoners on
parole, including Kim Keun-tae, who received this year's Robert F.
Kennedy Award for Human Rights.
   Hundreds of political prisoners have been released from South
Korean prisons since June 29, 1987, when nationwide protests forced
the government to accept demands for democratic reforms.
   Opposition groups maintain there are more than 500 dissidents
imprisoned for political beliefs or anti-government activity.

<TEXT>
   Long lines of curious filmgoers turned out to see ``The Last
Temptation of Christ'' in nine cities, greatly outnumbering the
protesters who denounced as sacrilegious the film that debuted in
guarded theaters.
   Many movie patrons left sold-out theaters Friday wondering what
all the fuss was about, while others said protesters were trying to
suppress free speech and religious toleration.
   ``It's just a movie, and you can't really condone it or say
anything about it until you've seen it,'' said James Aguiar, 23,
one of hundreds of patrons who lined up around the block at New
York's Ziegfeld Theater.
   About 500 would-be viewers were turned away from the 1,000-seat
theater showing the movie in San Francisco.
   The film was released six weeks early by Universal as the uproar
mounted over its depiction of a Jesus Christ filled with self-doubt
and tempted to abandon his call as a savior to live as a mortal. In
the film, Christ resists this ``last temptation.''
   Protesters have damned the film as sacrilege, saying it portrays
Christ as a deranged and lust-driven human, who, while being
crucified, dreams he marries and has sex with Mary Magdalene and
lives his life as an ordinary man.
   Some leaders from evangelical Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon
and Orthodox Jewish groups called the film blasphemous, sparking a
demonstration Thursday by 25,000 opponents of the film in Los
Angeles.
   Cardinal Bernard Law, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Boston,
urged Catholics to boycott the film, calling it ``morally offensive
and repugnant to Christian belief.''
   But Tom Burger, communications director for the United Methodist
Church's West Virginia conference, called it ``a theological
issue.''
   ``If Christ was to know what it was like to be human, I would
like to think that he would be tempted with human temptations.''
And, Burger added, ``My faith is not threatened by a movie.''
   Although the protests were peaceful, uniformed security guards
Friday checked purses and bags of movie patrons in Washington, New
York, Los Angeles and Toronto, and guards also stood alongside the
screen in New York and Los Angeles, but no major disturbances were
reported. There was minor vandalism at the Los Angeles theater and
an arrest for disorderly conduct in New York.
   In Los Angeles, Universal President Tom Pollock said he was
gratified by the audience response.
   ``I didn't know what to expect until we had an audience that was
not clergy or press,'' Pollock said. ``They applauded and I applaud
them.''
   The Toronto audience included priests and divinity students.
Canon Garth Bulmer of the Anglican Church agreed with other more
liberal Christians, such as the Episcopal bishop of New York, that
the film is provocative but not blasphemous.
   ``I enjoyed it even though much was far-fetched. It does make
you think a lot about Jesus,' he said.
   In Chicago, the Rev. Nikitas Lulias, chancellor of the
200,000-member Chicago-area Greek Orthodox Diocese, was among about
50 protesters at the Biograph Theater.
   ``We have called on our people to go with prayer in the hearts _
that God might anoint these individuals to stop showing the film,''
said Lulias.
   But 24-year-old James Schatz of Chicago said as he entered the
sold-out showing that he was puzzled by objections to the film,
based on the 1955 novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis.
   ``It's based on a fictional book. It's a work of fiction. I
don't think Martin Scorsese meant to offend anyone.''
   Scorsese, raised as a Roman Catholic, says the film he directed
is an affirmation of faith to provoke people to think about Jesus
as a man confronting temptation.
   A dozen fellow directors, including Warren Beatty, Peter
Bogdanovich, Penny Marshall, James Brooks and Walter Hill,
expressed support at a news conference Friday in Los Angeles.
   ``We owe a debt of gratitude to this group of somewhat misguided
zealots. The film now will be seen by a lot of curiosity-seekers,''
said John Badham, director of ``Short Circuit'' and ``WarGames.''
``What is not terrific is their effort to rewrite the Bill of
Rights.''
   The movie also opened in Seattle, Minneapolis and Montreal. A
Universal spokesman said no decision has been made whether to add
other cities next week.

<HEAD>Jerry Falwell Displays Anti-Dukakis Comic Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A liberal activist group is urging
Republicans to repudiate a comic book being touted by conservative
evangelist Jerry Falwell that portrays Michael Dukakis as a
supporter of witchcraft and bestiality.
   Falwell is urging his followers to paper the political landscape
with copies of the 30-page book, titled ``Magical Mike: The Real
Story of Mike Dukakis.'' Among other things, it depicts the
Democratic presidential nominee in a dress, wig and pearls.
   ``The last thing the Bush campaign, the Republican Party and the
presidential campaign need is the distribution of 10 million copies
of a comic book that's chock full of enough intolerance to offend
just about everyone except Jerry Falwell,'' John Buchanan, chairman
of People for the American Way, said Friday.
   In Washington, Dick Hafer of Lanham, Md., the book's producer,
said in an interview Friday night that the material is all
documented and the drawings are stylized to make a point.
   ``I think it's fair,'' said Hafer, who calls himself the
``Comics Commando'' on the booklet. ``I think it certainly has a
point of view ... I'd say it's accurate, that's the most important
thing,'' he added.
   Hafer said he has done other comic books on political topics,
including one called ``Every Family Has One'' during Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy's 1982 re-election race, depicting the Massachusetts
Democrat as a black sheep.
   In the Dukakis comic, the Massachusetts governor is called
``Sheriff Pansy'' for his crime-fighting record, especially the
state's prison furlough program.
   The book suggests that Dukakis would ruin the nation's defense
system and describes him as an enemy of babies for his stand in
favor of women being allowed to have abortions. In one drawing,
Dukakis is dressed in doctor's garb holding the hose of a vacuum.
   Elsewhere, a supporter is shown holding a sign that says: ``The
best baby is a dead baby.''
   Falwell, founder of the conservative Moral Majority, displayed
the book Thursday night at a rally in advance of the Monday start
of the Republican National Convention.
   Samples of the booklet had been passed out before Falwell spoke
and he subsequently explained how he had been impressed with the
artist who drew the comic book and purchased several thousand
copies to bring with him to New Orleans.
   He urged the audience to buy some on their way out of the
meeting and distribute them to everyone they knew.
   ``I want to shoot the guy's legs out from under him,'' Falwell
said of Dukakis. ``I want to expose him. This man is to the left of
Walter Mondale, George McGovern and, maybe, to the left of (Soviet
leader Mikhail) Gorbachev.''
   Asked whether he agreed with Falwell's aim, Hafer said, ``I
would like to see people have a chance to get all this information
in one spot. I think people who have the facts can make a good
decision.''
   One page in the comic book lists what it describes as bills
Dukakis filed in 1970 as a state representative, including measures
repealing a law punishing blasphemy, the law against fornication
and ``the law prohibiting the crime against nature (either with
mankind or with beast).''
   The book says Dukakis appointed a ``priestess of witchcraft as
the official witch of Salem'' over the objections of the Salem City
Council and questions whether the Greek Orthodox church is aware of
this.
   The book also suggests that Dukakis panders to special interest.
At one point it shows him dressed as a woman with a wig, dress and
strand of pearls. At another, it has him riding the shoulders of
Jesse Jackson.

   Moslem extremist swinging chains and hurling
stones battled riot police in a Cairo suburb, and 19 people,
including three police officers, were wounded, authorities said
today.
   A senior police official said more than 120 extremists were
involved in the incident Friday night. He said riot police fired
tear gas and used sticks to control the crowd and that more than 70
extremists were arrested.
   One police pickup truck was set ablaze, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with department
procedure.
   The official said the clash occurred outside a mosque in the
northeastern Cairo suburb of Ein Shams.
   He said police, acting on a tip, had gone to the Adam Mosque and
were waiting outside to detain a number of extremist suspects who
were meeting inside after evening prayers.
   The police action apparently was part of a nationwide security
operation that began after three Moslem fundamentalists serving
life terms in the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat
escaped from a maximum-security prison in a Cairo suburb on July 17.
   Two of them have died in shootouts with police, and the third
was rearrested.
   ``The clash began after policemen moved to make arrests as the
extremists were leaving the mosque,'' the official said.
   In the fighting outside the mosque, which lasted less than half
an hour, the extremists hurled stones and flaming objects and used
chains against police who attacked with tear gas and sticks, the
police official said
   Three policemen were wounded, one seriously, and 16 civilians
suffered ``medium or minor injuries,'' he said. Some were taken to
hospitals, but he did not say how many.

   Actor Willem Dafoe, who plays Jesus in
``The Last Temptation of Christ,'' is a Christian who would not do
anything blasphemous, his parents say.
   ``We are proud of our son and we trust his judgment,'' Muriel
Dafoe said Friday. ``He was brought up in a Christian home, and he
believes in God.''
   Mrs. Dafoe and her husband, William, said they respect the
rights of those protesting the film, which opened Friday. But, said
Mrs. Dafoe, ``I would ask that they respect the rights of others to
see the film and make their own decision.''
   In the role of Jesus, Willem Dafoe dreams about marrying and
having sex with Mary Magdalene. That, say many of the movie's
critics, slanders and blasphemes Christ.
   ``I think a lot of people are judgmental before they have seen
the picture,'' said the actor's father, a retired surgeon who moved
to Orlando four years ago. ``I think they should decide whether
they like it or not when they've seen it.''

   Vice President Salvador Laurel today
accused President Corazon Aquino of incompetence and called for her
to resign. He threatened to quit the coalition government if she
refuses.
   In a four-page letter to the president, which he read to
reporters, Laurel said Mrs. Aquino was not adequately fighting the
nation's 19-year communist insurgency and was allowing corruption
on the scale of her deposed predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino, who took office in February 1986, accused Laurel of
not taking an active role in government and said at times he was
more interested in playing golf than in attending important Cabinet
meetings.
   ``Madame President: the time has come to tell our people with
humility and candor that the presidency itself is the problem _
because the task requires a higher level of competence _ in the
face of advancing communist insurgency, the breakdown of law and
order, the resurgence of widespread corruption, the paralyzation of
the political will and the growing desperation of our people,''
Laurel said.
   Laurel accused Mrs. Aquino of not consulting him on important
issues and urged her to step down and call for an immediate
election or ``I will have no choice but to forthwith dissociate
myself from your government.''
   Laurel told reporters later that he does not necessarily intend
to quit his post.
   ``This (dissociation) means I am quitting the coalition
government. I am not resigning as vice president of the republic,''
he said. He refused to say if he was forming an opposition group.
   But Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the only opposition figure in the
23-member Senate, welcomed Laurel to the opposition and said the
two would meet soon ``to bring about a very strong and effective
opposition in this country.''
   Mrs. Aquino said later that the vice president had only himself
to blame for the small role he played in government. But she gave
no direct response to Laurel's call for an election or for her to
resign. The next presidential election is scheduled for May 1992.
   Laurel's political base has been eroding steadily since Mrs.
Aquino's election. Most of his backers in the Philippine House of
Representatives have reportedly thrown their support to Mrs. Aquino.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters that when she called members of her
Cabinet to an urgent meeting during a November 1986 coup attempt,
Laurel did not show up until late in the afternoon ``because he was
playing golf.''
   ``Can you imagine what would have happened if I waited for him
while he played golf?'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   Mrs. Aquino said that during an Aug. 28, 1987, coup attempt in
which 53 people were killed and hundreds wounded, Laurel never
issued a statement of support for her.
   The break between Laurel and Mrs. Aquino first surfaced in
September 1987, when the vice president gave up his post as foreign
secretary and announced he would no longer serve in the Cabinet
because of ``fundamental differences'' over the communist
insurgency and other issues.
   Laurel, who remained in the elected post of vice president,
accused Mrs. Aquino of refusing to take his advice on critical
issues.
   Laurel, whose family had been among the country's most
influential, renounced his candidacy for president against Marcos
in December 1985 and agreed to run for the second spot on the
Aquino ticket under pressure from the Roman Catholic hierachy and
other opposition leaders.
   Mrs. Aquino ran under the banner of Laurel's United Nationalist
Democratic Organization, or UNIDO, in the February 1986 elections
that led to Marcos' ouster after 20 years in power.
   Since his break with the president in September last year,
Laurel's political fortunes have declined steadily. His nephew,
Benjamin Laurel, was defeated in January in the race for governor
of Batangas province, the Laurel family stronghold.
   On Friday, the Philippine Daily Globe reported that 21 of the 22
UNIDO members of the House of Representatives had decided to bolt
Laurel's party and join a pro-Aquino alliance.
   Laurel's charges followed renewed allegations of corruption and
mismanagement in the government, which came to power on the promise
of reform.
   The country's solicitor-general, Francisco Chavez, has accused
the Presidential Commission on Good Government, formed to recover
the billions Marcos allegedly stole in office, of rampant
corruption.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Aquino fired the head of the government's food
authority for incompetence after an investigation found widespread
irregularities but cleared the chairman himself of criminal
wrongdoing.
   Meanwhile, communist urban guerrillas and right-wing death
squads have stepped up street assassinations in Manila and other
major cities.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against Abortion Notification Law</HEAD>

   An Ohio law restricting the rights of females
under 18 to have abortions was declared unconstitutional by a
federal appeals court days after a similar Minnesota law was upheld.
   A three-judge 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Friday
unanimously upheld a ruling by a U.S. district judge in Cleveland
barring the state from enforcing the 1986 law.
   It required that doctors performing abortions on unmarried women
younger than 18 must notify the women's parents.
   On Monday, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis
upheld a similar law in Minnesota. That law requires minors seeking
abortions to notify both parents or get judicial permission 48
hours before the procedure.
   Linda Sogg, a Cleveland lawyer who argued against the Ohio law,
praised Friday's ruling.
   ``It is a victory for all the parents who have wonderful
relationships with their children who don't need laws to have
communication,'' Ms. Sogg said. ``I also think it is a
constitutional victory of some great importance for young women,
for the privacy of their bodies, and for adult women and their
bodies.''
   Roger Evans, a lawyer with the Planned Parenthood Federation of
America in New York City, also hailed the ruling.
   ``We're glad that the court has upheld the rights of minor women
to have constitutionally guaranteed services without imposing undue
burdens,'' Evans said.
   The appeals court cited the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973
decision that a woman has a fundamental constitutional right to
seek an abortion.
   U.S. District Judge Ann Aldrich had found that portions of the
Ohio law were either unconstitutionally vague or infringed on the
constitutional rights of females younger than 18. The judge
objected to a specific requirement that the doctor must be the one
to notify parents. She said this placed an unfair burden on a young
woman's right of access to an abortion.
   The judge also ruled that the Ohio law fails to adequately
protect a minor woman's right to confidentiality. In addition, Ms.
Aldrich concluded that the law unfairly requires a minor who seeks
court approval to have an abortion without parental notification to
prove that she is sufficiently mature to make her own decision to
undergo the procedure.
   Lawyers for the state had argued that the law is constitutional
and appealed to the 6th Circuit for permission to enforce it.
   Rita Eppler, an assistant Ohio attorney general who argued the
case for the state, declined to comment Friday on the appeals
court's ruling until she sees it. She refused to say if the state
would appeal further.
   The case began when the Akron Center for Reproductive Health,
two minor women and Dr. Max Pierre Gaujean, who performs abortions
at the Akron center, filed suit to block enforcement of the law.

   A smoky two-alarm fire that climbed 16 floors
through a utility shaft to the top of the Empire State Building
forced the evacuation of 1,500 tourists and office workers and
temporarily knocked 11 radio stations off the air.
   Eight minor injuries were reported in Friday's blaze.
   ``There was no panic ... It was crowded but there was no
confusion. People acted very, very sensibly,'' said Nick Cavatoro,
spokesman for the 102-story building's owners.
   Both observation decks _ on the 86th and top floors _ of the
Manhattan landmark were to reopen this morning, Cavatoro said.
   Three firefighters were injured and one building occupant
suffered an arm laceration but refused treatment, Fire Department
spokesman John Mulligan said Friday afternoon. One of the injured
firemen was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital after he was overcome
by heat and smoke, Mulligan said. Four other firemen reportedly
were treated later for minor injuries.
   ``The greatest difficulty up there was the extreme heat and
humidity,'' said a sweat-soaked firefighter, Mark Keisey, of the
93-degree heat. ``At times it felt like we were on our last legs.''
   Eight FM radio stations whose antennas are atop the skyscraper
were knocked off the air for at least four hours, and three others
were off for an hour or less.
   ``There was lots and lots of smoke, but that's all. It was
coming out the vents,'' said Tracie Ricks, who works on the 65th
floor.
   The fire was discovered by building employees in a utility room
on the 86th floor, but a few minutes later it was found it had
burned its way up a shaft.
   Fifth Avenue traffic backed up for more than 20 blocks during
the firefighting, said Victor Ross of the city's Transportation
Department.

<HEAD>Hezbollah Official Denounces U.N. Resolution on Higgins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, today attacked the U.N. Security
Council's call for the release of kidnapped U.S. Marine Lt. Col.
William R. Higgins.
   ``We denounce and condemn the U.N. Security Council which
accepted to allow such an agent (Higgins) to confront our people,''
said Abbas Mousawi, a ranking Hezbollah official.
   ``The arrest (of Higgins) was in defense of our nation's honor,
dignity and existence,'' Mousawi added in an interview with the
weekly An-Nahar Arab and International magazine.
   The Security Council on July 29 unanimously condemned
politically motivated kidnappings in the Middle East and appealed
for the immediate release of Higgins, who headed a 76-member U.N.
observer group in south Lebanon.
   Higgins, 43, of Danville, Ky., was abducted near the southern
port city of Tyre on Feb. 17.
   Higgins' pro-Iranian kidnappers, the underground Organization of
the Oppressed on Earth, said April 21 that he was to be tried on
charges of spying for the United States.
   The United States and the United Nations have denied the spying
charge.
   Bassam Abu Sharif, spokesman for the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said in an interview published July 8 that Higgins
was planning an operation before his abduction to rescue eight
American hostages.
   The 18 foreign hostages held by Hezbollah-affiliated factions in
Lebanon, in addition to the nine Americans, are three Britons, a
West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and two
unidentified men.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Lebanese and foreign security officials believe that Hezbollah,
made up of radical Shiite zealots loyal to Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, is an umbrella for the hostage-holding groups.
   Asked whether Hezbollah would help in the release of the foreign
hostgages if it was asked to do so by Iran, Mousawi said: ``We are
not involved in this issue.'' He did not elaborate.

   Showers and thunderstorms remained today in southeast New York
state as well as the upper Mississippi Valley and northwest Texas,
from southern Arkansas to northern Louisiana, and across the upper
Plains into western Kansas.
   Thunderstorms in McCook, Neb., dropped more than 3 inches of
rain Friday and caused the Republican River to overflow its banks
and flood parts of the town. A downpour produced an inch of rain in
five minutes at Kulm, N.D.
   Among the heavier rainfalls during the six hours ending 2 a.m.
EDT today were more than 2 inches at North Platte, Neb., and almost
an inch at Grand Island, Neb. All other reports of rainfall during
the same period amounted to less than half an inch.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms in
Florida, Missouri, North Dakota and parts of Maine; from southeast
Louisiana across central Mississippi; across the upper Great Lakes;
and in the upper Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s and 70s along
much of the California Coast and in the 70s over the northern
Pacific Coast; in the 70s and 80s in northern New England, the
upper Great Lakes, the northern Mississippi Valley, the Rockies and
other parts of the West; near 100 across southwest Texas; and 110
in the desert Southwest. The rest of the nation likely will hit the
90s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 49 degrees at
Yellowstone, Wyo., to 93 at Phoenix.

   Radical students battled riot police
in scattered clashes today in an effort to break through human
barriers aimed at preventing a march to the border for talks with
North Korean students.
   Shopowners and residents near college campuses staged
demonstrations urging students to halt unrest which they said hurts
business and would mar next month's Olympic Games in the capital.
   A senior government official said the government was considering
``a grave decision'' this fall to protect the nation from leftist
forces. Newspapers and political analyists interpreted the remarks
as suggesting a crackdown on dissent after the Games.
   About 1,000 students sneaked onto Yonsei University campus
despite human barricades set up by thousands of riot police around
the campus in an effort to block student gatherings. Students
hurled hundreds of firebombs in a series of attacks around the
campus but failed to break the police blockade.
   Dozens of policemen in heavy riot gear were seen falling down
after being hit by rocks, sticks or iron pipes in continued battles
along the fence. Police responded with barrages of tear gas.
   Police also drove back about 200 students who hurled firebombs
and rocks in an effort to march from the Myongdong Roman Catholic
cathedral in downtown Seoul.
   At least 20 students were injured, and about 200 were taken into
police custody.
   About 500 shopowners and residents around Yonsei demonstrated
between students and riot police at the gate. They urged students
not to cause unrest that hurts business and the Olympic mood.
   Similar counter-protests were reported near the Myongdong
Cathedral by some 100 people carrying placards, in front of the
Korea University in eastern Seoul and two other cities, according
to Korean news agency Yonhap.
   The radicals claim that more than 7,000 students across the
country have volunteered to join a rally at Yonsei that is to
continue until Monday, when students plan to march to the border
for reunification talks with their North Korean counterparts.
   North and South Korean student representatives have called for a
meeting in the border truce village of Panmunjom on Monday to mark
the Aug. 15 anniversary of the liberation of the Korean Peninsula
from Japan's colonial rule in 1945.
   Korea was divided into the Communist North and the capitalist
South at the end of World War II, and the division deepened after a
bloody war in 1950-53. Radical South Korean students, a small but
vocal minority, are demanding reunification.
   Police bent on foiling disturbances before the Sept. 17-Oct. 2
Olympics in Seoul have enforced stringent security measures to
block student marches and rallies advocating talks with North
Korean students.
   Police said they have been ordered to refrain from using tear
gas as part of a government effort to maintain a festive Olympic
mood. But the strategy has led to more injuries. Police said at
least 120 students and policemen have been injured since Wednesday.
   Kim Yong-kap, the minister for government administration,
accused the students of seeking to disrupt the Olympics and
overthrow the government and said, ``The government cannot but make
a grave decision after the Olympics if the current political
situation continues.''
   A former military officer, Kim served as a senior intelligence
official at the Agency for National Security Planning, formerly
called the KCIA, under the authoritarian government of former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Kim said the nation was at a crossroads where it would be
``communized like Vietnam'' or prosper with democracy. He said
there has been an expansion of leftist forces aligning themselves
with North Korean propaganda.
   ``At this point, the protection of our democratic system is more
important than the successful hosting of the Olympics,'' Kim added.

   Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned
leader of the African National Congress, is being treated in a
hospital for a lung ailment, the South African Press Association
said today.
   The reports said Mandela, 70, was being treated for fluid around
his left lung.
   Dr. G. L. Strauss, medical superintendent at Tygerberg Hospital,
told SAPA that Mandela was admitted Friday and was undergoing
tests. ``At present, he is comfortable and in a satisfactory
condition,'' Strauss said.
   Mandela, who has been in prison since 1962, is serving a life
term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow South Africa's
white-led government. The outlawed ANC is the main guerrilla group
fighting the government.
   Mandela is incarcerated at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town.

   About 50 communist guerrillas
dressed as soldiers attacked a town in the southern Philippines and
executed six people, the military said today.
   Col. Cesar Fortuno, provincial army chief, told reporters the
attack occured Friday in the mountain village of Tuburan in
Zamboanag del Norte province, about 10 miles southeast of here and
460 miles south of Manila.
   He said the communist New People's Army raided the village of
200 people two days after some residents enlisted with a group of
anti-communist forces in the area.
   Fortuno said the rebels opened fired with automatic weapons on a
group of people gathered at the outskirts of the village. The
attack left six people dead and three wounded.
   Local militiamen recovered the bodies after the guerrillas
escaped in a nearby forest.

   Though needle drug abusers often change their
practices when told of the risks of AIDS, many still suffer immune
system damage that may make it difficult to ward off the disease, a
study suggests.
   Researchers also confirmed Friday that one's state of mind
affects the immune system, and suggested it may make a difference
with AIDS.
   The work was presented at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association.
   The change in drug practices is significant because drug users
are often thought not responsive to health warnings, said
researcher John Watters.
   His study, done in San Francisco, found users cut back on the
sharing of hypodermic needles, which can spread the AIDS virus,
cleaned their needles more and increased their use of condoms
during sex when told of the dangers.
   ``We found dramatic changes'' after a program to educate drug
users began in 1986, said Watters, of the Urban Health Study in San
Francisco.
   Intravenous drug abuse is blamed for about 19 percent of the
nation's cumulative total of some 70,000 cases of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Workers in the San Francisco program told drug abusers about
AIDS prevention measures, distributed condoms and gave out bleach
to disinfect needles.
   Researchers studied drug and condom practices of 386 drug users
interviewed in 1986 before the program began, and 545 users
interviewed in early 1987 some eight months after the start of the
program. An additional 534 were sampled later in 1987, and 553 in
early 1988.
   Use of ``safe needle hygiene'' rose from 13 percent of the time
drugs were used before the outreach program to 63 percent
afterward. Safe hygiene was defined as using bleach, alcohol,
hydrogen peroxide or boiling water to disinfect needles, or not
sharing needles.
   The follow-up surveys found hygiene used 70 percent of the time
in late 1987 and 71 percent in early 1988.
   The estimated number of sharing partners dropped from an average
of 11 before the outreach program to eight in early 1987, with nine
and five reported in the following two surveys.
   Condom use rose from 3 percent of the time before the outreach
program to 16 percent afterwards, with 23 percent in each of the
follow-up surveys.
   Blood tests found that the rate of users exposed to the AIDS
virus jumped from 6 percent in early 1986 to 13 percent in early
1987, with 9 percent and 11 percent in the following two surveys.
   James Sorensen of the University of California, San Francisco,
who has studied AIDS prevention among drug users in treatment, said
Watters' results on behavioral change ring true.
   But, he warned, `` We need to work very hard to reach people who
haven't been reached.''
   The study of drug users in treatment focused on 30 outpatients
in a long-term methadone program. None had been infected with the
AIDS virus, said Nancy Klimas of the University of Miami School of
Medicine and the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Miami.
   But they showed significant deficiencies in the functioning of
their disease-fighting immune system, she said. For example, the
functioning of their ``natural killer cells'' was about half of
normal, she said.
   Poor nutrition, non-AIDS infections, prior drug abuse or perhaps
the methadone may be responsible, but no cause has yet been found,
she said.
   Don Des Jarlais of the New York State Division of Substance
Abuse Services said previous research has shown that immune
abnormalities in drug users can take years to disappear once they
enter methadone treatment.
   Klimas' study also found that immune system function was better
by several measures in abusers who showed greater ``hardiness,''
defined as commitment to life, a feeling of control and a tendency
to see stresses as challenges.
   Loneliness and confusion were associated with poorer immune
system performance, she said. But no cause-and-effect conclusion
can be drawn from any of the psychological data, she cautioned.
   Another study released Friday found that for homosexual men soon
after AIDS infection, immune system functioning was better in men
determined to get on with life, who focused on and expressed their
emotions, and who had a feeling of psychological robustness.
   Again, no cause-and-effect conclusions can yet be drawn, said
Nancy Blaney of the University of Miami School of Medicine.

   Don't mention the idea of selling ice to
the Eskimos to 8-year-old Cody Carr. It might give him more ideas,
and he's too young to run an empire in the the arctic.
   Surrounded by an invasion of grasshoppers in the ranchland of
western Montana, the youngster has cleared $875 in the last month _
selling grasshoppers to fishermen.
   The infestation of grasshoppers began on his parents' ranch near
Plains in July. Wave after wave of hoppers moved through the area,
munching crops, grass and trees.
   But one day, watching the latest wave sweep by, ``I was
thinking, `How can I make money off 'em?''' he recalled this week.
``I went to my mom and asked if I could start a business. I could
sell 'em for fishing bait.''
   With tens of thousands of hoppers jumping free just outside,
Vikki Carr says she was skeptical.
   ``I didn't think we'd sell very many,'' she said.
   But she agreed, as much to keep a bored 8-year-old occupied as
for any other reason. And the next morning, when the hoppers were
logy from the morning chill, they started harvesting.
   As of Aug. 10, Cody, his mother and some helpers had collected
95,000 hoppers from the yard and nearby fields. He sold 1,200
packages _ 28,800 hoppers at two dozen per bag _ to sporting goods
stores in seven western states.
   The money _ $875 so far, after marketing, distribution and
packaging _ is in a college fund. And, Cody's mother says, more
money is coming in every day.
   ``We can barely keep up,'' she said. ``We're getting calls from
all over.''

   ``By starting their marriage on a roller coaster they must vow
to ride through life together in motion sickness and in health, as
well as through bumps, jumps and the 110-foot drops that life can
bring,'' the minister said.
   The ceremony began in the passenger loading station at the
amusement park north of Los Angeles and ended 3{ minutes later when
the white-knuckle chapel-on-wheels returned.
   At the ride's conclusion, the couple was pronounced man and
wife, and they kissed.
   ``Although this seems like an unusual wedding ceremony, we
thought it would be a thrilling way to start our new life
together,'' said the black tuxedoed Ball.
   ``This is the most exciting day of my life. Marrying Michael on
Colossus is a dream come true for me,'' said Debbie, wearing a
white gown and veil. ``Life is made of ups and downs, and what
better way to celebrate our commitment to one another than on a
roller coaster.''
   Ball is a computer technician and his wife is a billing clerk.
The Balls will live in Buena Park, Calif., upon return from their
honeymoon, which will consist of a weekend of roller coaster riding
at Magic Mountain.

<HEAD>Outgoing Meese Criticizes New York Prosecutor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Meese, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani defended an
assistant's use of the word ``sleaze'' to describe outgoing
Attorney General Edwin Meese III after Meese called the comment
``first-year law student stuff.''
   In his last day on the job Friday after 3{ controversial years
at the Justice Department, Meese blasted Giuliani and Assistant
U.S. Attorney Edward Little for the remark, made by Little during
his closing arguments in the racketeering trial of U.S. Rep. Mario
Biaggi.
   ``I think it was poor procedure and poor practice by any
prosecutor,'' Meese said in Washington. ``And I think that any
prosecutor who did that undermines his own case.''
   The trial, which stemmed from scandals surrounding the
Bronx-based Wedtech Corp., ended last week with convictions against
Biaggi and four others.
   The defense had based its case in part on assertions that
corrupt Wedtech executives had connections to high-ranking Reagan
administration officials, like Meese, and thus did not need the
help of Biaggi or his co-defendants in securing government
contracts.
   However, Little called the ``Meese defense'' a smokescreen,
surprising the courtroom by conceding ``Meese is a sleaze'' while
adding that that should not detract from the guilt or innocence of
the defendants.
   Giuliani said Little's words were ``as if they were my own.''
   Near the end of the trial, a special prosecutor in Washington
announced there was insufficient evidence to charge Meese with any
wrongdoing, but he questioned his ethics on several issues. Meese
announced his resignation after the report was completed, saying it
exonerated him.
   Giuliani said Friday the ``sleaze'' comment was ``fully
supported by the record in this case.'' He added that he was
``ready to defend it, anytime, anywhere, anyplace.''
   Little said that, ``had (Meese) been a reputable attorney
general, we wouldn't have had to make that remark.''

   Fathers can help boys achieve higher educational
development by providing social and emotional support in childhood,
but for daughters the key age for offering support is adolescence,
a new study suggests.
   ``Shooting a basketball on the court in the evening with your
(adolescent) daughter has a positive effect ... on how far she'll
go in education,'' said researcher John Snarey.
   But sons will benefit more from such activities as taking them
trick-or-treating, supporting their joining the Boy Scouts and
spending time with them before bedtime, all while the child is
between ages 1 and 10, the study suggests.
   The work was presented Friday at the annual meeting of the
American Psychological Association. Snarey, a psychology professor
at Emory University in Atlanta, collaborated with Anthony Maier at
Northwestern University.
   They looked at data on childrearing practices collected from 248
working-class, white men in Boston in a study that began some 40
years ago. Then they compared that to the educational levels the
fathers' first-born children went on to achieve by age 25 or older.
About half the children were daughters.
   Similar results have been reported before from studies done
without such long-term followup, Snarey said.
   Specifically, the researchers looked at how far above the
parents' education level the children eventually rose.
   For girls, that difference was accentuated when fathers had
supported their physical development between ages 11 and 19,
through such activities as teaching them sports, giving sex
education, and taking them to the dentist.
   One possible explanation is that boys probably get help with
physical development from other people such as coaches if the
father doesn't provide it, while girls often don't have alternative
sources, Snarey said.
   Helpful activities for boys during childhood stressed
social-emotional development, such as rocking the infant to sleep
and calming the boy's fears of darkness.
   Activities to foster intellectual development did not appear to
help boys or girls, the study found.
   Researchers also looked at the eventual occupational levels of
the children, and found higher levels among females whose fathers
had provided more social-emotional development during adolescence.
That included such activities as taking them to church, spending
time with them on weekends and providing guidance on dating
problems.
   No fathering activities were found to help the boys'
occupational levels.
   The various analyses in the study took into account the
education levels of the father and mother, marital problems,
alcohol abuse, number of children, the father's IQ and his ways of
coping with stress.
   Researchers cautioned that the fathers typically began their
families during the 1950s and that other forces not addressed in
the study are no doubt acting on fathers who started families since
then.
   In addition, the sample included only white, urban,
working-class fathers, so results may not apply in other
populations, reseachers said.

<TEXT>
   Two buses collided in northern Iran,
killing 30 people and injuring 50, Tehran radio reported today.
   The radio also said two strong earthquakes jolted the southern
city of Bushehr, but no injuries or damage was immediately reported.
   A nuclear power station is under construction close to the city,
but the state-run radio did not mention the facility in its brief
report.
   The two buses collided on the heavily traveled Tehran-Tabriz
highway on Friday, the report said without providing further
details.
   The earthquakes centered in Bushehr measured 6 and 6.2 on the
Richter scale, the radio reported in a broadcast monitored in
Nicosia.
   It did not say when the quakes occurred.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion
is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Rain Helps Firefighters in Yellowstone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first significant
rainfall since Memorial Day helped cool fires burning in nearly
200,000 acres of the nation's oldest park, and all roads, hotels
and campgrounds were open today.
   In California, the pilot of a U.S. Forest Service plane was
killed Friday when his plane crashed while working a 1,700-acre
fire in the Sequoia National Forest near Bakersfield, authorities
said. Another firefighter died, apparently of a heart attack,
battling a fast-moving wildfire in Oregon.
   Fires also burned in Idaho and Montana.
   Yellowstone got about two hours of intermittent rain Friday
afternoon, park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said.
   ``One short rain shower is not adequate to douse the fires. But
it does help increase humidity in the air and it helps slow the
fires down,'' said Anzelmo.
   The temperature in Yellowstone cooled down Friday afternoon, the
wind slowed and firefighters made some progress, she said.
   The 40,000-acre North Fork fire was the only blaze to grow
Friday, increasing about 3,000 acres. The fire had caused the
closing of the road from Madison Junction to Old Faithful on
Thursday, but was reopened Friday morning. Tourist activity in
Yellowstone remained high, Anzelmo said, despite the fires.
   ``We are continuing to see a very busy park with campgrounds and
hotels each night,'' she said. ``But the last two days, there have
been fairly smoky conditions in the park and the vicinity, so that
has been difficult for everyone.''
   In Montana, cool, cloudy weather slowed a 2,800-acre fire
burning in the Elkhorn Mountains southeast of Helena. Fire crews
continued the slow work of building fire lines by hand in steep
terrain, officials said. The cool weather also helped 125
firefighters battling an 8,000-acre grass and range fire southeast
of Dillon.
   Firefighters contended with winds gusting up to 25 mph as they
fought to control a fast-moving Oregon wildfire that destroyed a
mobile home and a refrigerated storage building near the community
of Mosier in the Columbia River Gorge.
   In central Wyoming on the Wind River Indian Reservation,
officials said a 1,000-acre sagebrush, grass and timber fire was
more than 70 percent contained.
   The lightning-caused fire began Thursday and was expected to be
controlled by Sunday, according to Bureau of Indian Affairs
officials. About 50 to 60 firefighters were on the scene north of
Riverton.
   Idaho's national forests have dropped their ``let-burn'' policy
on wilderness lands because of the drought and are sending hundreds
of firefighters to spot fires caused by a second round of lightning
storms.
   A quarter-inch of rain Friday helped dampen the raging
2,600-acre Walker Creek fire that threatened the town of Inkom in
southeastern Idaho.
   ``It was very significant in putting it down so we could work on
it,'' Caribou National Forest spokesman Frank Carroll said.
   The fire acreage was revised from 4,000 to about 2,600 Friday
night, he said.

<HEAD>South Africa Threatens To Expel Argentine Consul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today said it will
expel Argentina's consul within 30 days unless the South American
country rescinds its expulsion order against a South African consul.
   The threat was contained in a message Minister of Foreign
Affairs Pik Botha sent from Vienna, where he is holding a meeting
on whether South Africa will sign the nuclear non-proliferation
treaty.
   Botha said Argentine Consul H.R. Basso will be given the same
amount of time to leave the nation as South Africa's consul, Dirk
de Wet, was given, unless Argentina reconsiders its expulsion order.
   Argentina earlier in the week ordered de Wet and three other
South Africans out of the country for allegedly violating their
visas. The government said they asked to visit Argentina for talks
with the consul, then participated in a pro-South Africa seminar
organized by the consulate.
   The three men have already left Argentina.
   They are Department of Foreign Affairs Deputy Chief Director of
Communication Planning Gerrit Olivier; the deputy leader of the
mixed-race house of Parliament, Miley Richards; and black mayor
Bennet Ndlazi of Mamelodi.
   Botha said he had instructed his department to summon Basso and
tell him that Argentina's action against de Wet was unreasonable
and unjustifiable.
   ``If a South African representative abroad does not even have
the right to invite guests to be briefed on South Africa, then such
representation is meaningless,'' said Botha.

   A mine exploded today in a
shopping center, injuring a black security guard and two whites,
police said.
   On Friday night, a similar device exploded outside a post
office, and police said three people were slightly injured.
   Shopkeepers denied earlier police reports that the Hyde Park
shopping center had been evacuated just before the 11:35 a.m.
explosion.
   A woman shopkeeper saw a parcel outside a clothing boutique and
notified a security guard, but it exploded before he reached it,
said a nearby shopkeeper, speaking on condition of anonymity. He
said there was no loudspeaker warning.
   The security guard was hospitalized, and a white man and woman
were slightly injured. Police said the explosion at the
Johannesburg mall was caused by a limpet mine, which can be
attached to another surface.
   Another limpet mine exploded at 8:15 p.m. Friday in a trash bin
outside the post office on the main commercial street in Pinetown,
near Durban.
   A post office spokesman said that a newly hired cleaner had
saved the building from greater damage because he failed to bring
all the trash bins inside the building.
   The mine exploded in one of the bins that was left outside. It
caused about $15,000 damage and slightly injured two mixed-race men
and a black man making telephone calls from booths outside the post
office, police said.
   There have been nearly 100 bomb explosions in the country since
a national state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986.
   Police blame most of the explosions on the outlawed African
National Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting to overthrow
the white-dominated government and its system of apartheid.
   The ANC seldom comments on individual bombings but says the
bombing and sabotage campaign is part of its strategy.
   Censorship rules imposed under the emergency ruled ban or
restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment
of detainees, most forms of peaceful protest and a broad range of
statements the government considers subversive.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million black majority has no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Iraq Calls for Syria's Expulsion From Arab League</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq today called on Arab countries to
expel Syria from the Arab League for ``treacherous practices
against the Arab nation.''
   A proposal to expel Syria would have to be considered during a
league summit meeting. Because most Arab countries maintain
relations with Syria, it is unlikely Iraq would prevail if such a
proposal came to a vote.
   First Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan also said the
Arab nations should end all dealings with the government of Syria's
president, Hafez Assad.
   ``The minimum Arab leaders could do is expel the traitor Assad
from their fold and to boycott him,'' Ramadan wrote in an article
in the governing Baath Party paper Al-Thawra. ``To maintain
contacts with him, whether directly or indirectly, means they are
encouraging him and taking part in his crimes.''
   Ramadan, who is also a member of the governing Revolution
Command Council, cited Syria's policy in Lebanon, attacks on
Palestinian camps in Beirut and its alliance with Iraq's enemy
Iran. Syria sent 40,000 troops into Lebanon and west Beirut to
control fighting between rival militias, among other reasons.
   Today's article contained Iraq's strongest attack in recent
memory on the Syrian leader and came several days after Iraq and
Iran accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the gulf war,
scheduled to begin Aug. 20.
   Syria has been a staunch supporter of Persian Iran against Arab
Iraq in the war, which started in September 1980. Attempts to
reconcile Baghdad and Damascus over the last seven years have
failed because of the deep mistrust built over the years between
the governing parties in the two countries.
   All major Arab countries are members of the Arab League with the
exception of Egypt, whose membership was suspended after it signed
the Camp David accord with Israel. The league's 21 members include
Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Lebanon and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.

   Otto E. Passman, a fourth grade dropout who
spent 30 years in Congress fighting foreign aid in particular and
government in general, died today in a hospital. He was 88.
   An outspoken convervative Democrat, Passman was the powerful
chairman of the House Appropiations subcommittee on foreign
operations for 22 years, from 1954-76.
   In 15 congressional elections, the Monroe businessman faced no
serious election challenges. But in 1976, Passman, in his 70s, ran
in the Democratic primary against Rep. Jerry Huckaby of Ringgold, a
youthful dairy farmer.
   Assailed by accusations he cheated on his congressional expense
accounts and browbeat foreign governments in grain deals, Passman
lost his re-election bid by more than 8,000 votes.
   Before the election Passman had been accused of padding his
travel expense accounts by claiming the more remunerative
automobile gasoline mileage for his trips to his home district,
although he actually traveled by airplane.
   Passman denied any intent to defraud and repaid the difference.
   Passman also denied more serious allegations of misusing his
office by persuading foreign governments into shipping their rice
in ships owned by the St. John Maritime Co. of California.

   Israeli troops opened fire today to disperse
stone-throwing Palestinian demonstrators in the Gaza Strip and
killed a 52-year-old man, the army and hospital officials said.
   Military officials said the demonstrators were protesting the
deaths of two Gaza Strip Arab workers in an arson fire Tuesday.
   In the West Bank, a Palestinian collaborator with Israel shot
and wounded three Palestinians from the village of Beitin near
Tulkarm, an official at Rafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus told The
Associated Press.
   Today's fatality brought the Palestinian death toll to 241 since
Palestinians launched a rebellion against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories on Dec. 8, 1987. Four Israelis have also died
in the violence.
   An Arab reporter said Palestinians in the Gaza Strip refrained
from using cars, buses and taxis today to protest Israeli orders
calling on them to buy new automobile license plates. Many stores
were shuttered in Gaza City.
   In the vegetable market of Rafah, on the Egyptian border,
protesters hurled stones at Israeli troops who opened fire to
disperse them, an army spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   One protester was killed and three wounded, including a
15-year-old girl, the spokesman and officials at Nasser hospital in
Khan Yunis said. The officials identified the dead man as Mohammed
Eid Abu Rizek, 52.
   Rioting later spread to Khan Yunis where five protesters were
shot and wounded in their legs, said hospital officials, also
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The army clamped curfews on four neighborhoods in Rafah, the
military spokesman said.
   Military officials said demonstrators were protesting the deaths
Tuesday of two Gaza Strip Arab workers. The workers were asleep in
a shack in Tel Aviv when it caught fire. Police said the fire,
which seriously injured a third man, was set deliberately.
   Another Arab reporter said three Palestinians from the village
of Beitin were shot and wounded by an Arab known to collaborate
with Israel.
   The reporter identified the assailant as Sadek Bele of the
village of Funduq, near Nablus. He said Bele shot at a Palestinian
flag hanging on a telephone pole and when villagers rushed toward
him, he shot at them.
   An official at Rafidiyeh Hospital in Nablus said one of the
wounded men, Taisir Ghanem, 18, who was hit in the groin and
operated on, said he was shot by a collaborator. Another
Palestinian was shot in the head and seriously wounded in the
incident, the official said.
   A district police spokesman, Yosef Fares, told The Associated
Press he was not authorized to answer questions on the incident.
The army spokesman said he had no details about the incident.
   In another development, three Arab workers were severely beaten
Friday by Jewish assailants while at work collecting garbage in the
Tel Aviv suburb of Givat Shmuel, the Israeli-owned Itim news agency
reported.
   The assailants also attacked the Arabs' Jewish employer who
rushed to the aid of his workers and smashed the windows of his
truck, the agency said.
   The attack was unprovoked, Itim reported.

<TEXT>
   Suspected Basque terrorists set off bombs
at six French-owned auto dealerships and a dairy in northern Spain
today, causing extensive damage but no injuries, government
officials said.
   Police defused bombs at two other car dealerships and searched
for bombs along a northern railroad line where an explosion ripped
up rails, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks. The officials
said they suspected the Basque terrorist group ETA, which has
attacked French-linked targets in the past to protest expulsions of
members of its group from France. ETA normally waits several days
before claiming responsibilities for bombings.
   The explosions occurred between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. in the
northern provinces of Alava, Logrono, and Santander.
   In Santander, bombs ripped through a Renault and two Peugeot
dealerships, destroying cars and mechanical equipment, Renault
spokeswoman Carmen Sollet said. A bomb also damaged the Larresse
dairy in El Astillero, she said.
   Ms. Sollet said damage was in the millions of dollars and the
bombs appeared to be a type used by the terrorists. She said police
defused a bomb at a second Renault dealership in Santander.
   Bombs also went off at Renault dealerships in the towns of
Logrono and Haro. An worker at the Logrono site said the explosion
destroyed the ground floor, blowing out an iron door and destroying
cars.
   In the town of La Guardia in Alava, a bomb caused an estimated
$200,000 damage at a Renault dealership, the civil governor's
office said.
   Also in Logrona, police exploded a bomb they found at a Citroen
dealership after receiving a telephone warning, the civil
governor's office said.
   Police were searching for bombs along a northern railroad line,
where an explosion ripped up some tracks and interrupted service
between the cities of Logrono and Castejon, the government
officials said.
   News reports speculated the attacks may be linked to the
kidnapping by ETA six months ago of Basque businessman Emiliano
Revilla. The reports said his family had sent ransom payments
intended for Basque terrorists in France, which ETA has been unable
to collect because of heavy surveillance by French police.
   ETA, which stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, seeks independence from Spain for the Basque region that
includes the provinces of Alava, Santander and Logrono.
   The group has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600
people, mostly police, military and civil guard officers, since it
began its violent struggle in 1968. Since June 1986, the French
government has expelled more than 165 alleged ETA members.

<TEXT>
   Republican George Bush, days away from receiving his party's
presidential nomination, has narrowed his list of potential running
mates, an informed source said today. Democrat Michael Dukakis
tagged Bush a ``George-come-lately'' on the environment.
   Bush met Friday with top advisers to discuss the decision on the
No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket. One participant in the meeting,
speaking only on condition of anonymity, said the list now has been
trimmed drastically from the original 16 names.
   While the source declined to name all the individuals under
consideration, the list was believed to include Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas; his wife, former Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole; Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana; Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming; Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Rep. Jack
Kemp of New York.
   The source said at least one other individual was under active
consideration. But the adviser refused to identify the prospect.
   Meanwhile, in New Orleans where workmen and party officials were
putting the final red, white and blue touches on a convention
designed as a show of the passing of control from President Reagan
to his designated successor, the GOP platform committee completed
work on a 30,000-word document Friday that described the election
as a choice between ``change and progress with the Republicans or
change and chaos with the Democrats.''
   The rival presidential candidates were out of the public eye
after an active day of campaigning Friday.
   At the vice president's residence in Washington, Bush worked on
his acceptance speech.
   Dukakis was spending a weekend at the beach after a five-state
campaign swing during which he blamed rising interest rates on
Reagan budget deficits and criticized Bush as a latecomer on
environmental issues.
   The Democratic nominee said he had opposed new offshore drilling
for oil and gas and noted his efforts to block drilling off
Massachusetts.
   ``I'm not a George-come-lately on this issue,'' said Dukakis.
   The Dukakis campaign also started broadcasting a television
commercial in California and Texas that touted his record as
governor of Massachusetts and said the state's prosperity ``wasn't
a miracle, it was leadership.''
   Republicans were arriving in New Orleans by the planeload for a
convention to celebrate Reagan's presidency and to proclaim Bush
his rightful successor.
   Reagan was to arrive in the convention city Sunday and be the
featured speaker Monday night.
   Bush won't arrive in New Orleans until Tuesday, the day before
he will be nominated without opposition for president.
   Television evangelist Pat Robertson announced he would not have
his name placed in nomination and would release his 93 delegates.
   Barbara Gattullo, an aide, said that when Robertson addresses
the convention Tuesday night, he will ``call for unity.''
   A comic book accusing Dukakis of supporting witchcraft and
bestiality and portraying him wearing a dress, wig and pearls, came
under fire Friday from John Buchanan, chairman of People for the
American Way, a liberal activist group, who urged Bush and the GOP
to repudiate 30-page book.
   Buchanan said that ``the last thing the Bush campaign, the
Republican Party and the presidential campaign need is the
distribution of 10 million copies of a comic book that's chock full
of enough intolerance to offend just about everyone except Jerry
Falwell,'' founder of the conservative Moral Majority, who
introduced the book at a rally Thursday night.
   Elephants, the traditional Republican symbol, were the animal of
choice throughout the convention city. Gray elephants, red, white
and blue elephants, cuddly elephants and inflatable elephants, even
a giant elephant perched atop the hotel overlooking the Superdome,
the enclosed stadium where the convention will take place.
   Workmen laid red, white and blue strips of carpeting across the
plaza between the hotel and the entrance to the Superdome.
   For Bush, the convention was an opportunity to cut the lead
Dukakis has held in opinion polls. Most recent surveys have said
the Democratic candidate was favored among likely voters by margins
ranging from 7 to 14 percentage points.
   But one new poll, released Friday by ABC News, said the race was
statistically deadlocked with Bush favored by 49 percent and
Dukakis by 46 percent, a difference well within the 6-point margin
of error.
   The convention rules committee approved changes that would allow
governors and members of Congress to be seated on the floor of the
1992 convention.
   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., said it would be good to let the
politicians be seated on the floor of the convention so they could
``rub elbows with the backbone of the party.''
   When the platform draft was completed, GOP leaders boasted that
they, unlike the Democrats, had come up with a document filled with
substance.
   ``We have Michael Dukakis the stealth candidate and the
Democratic Party the stealth party,'' former Rep. Tom Loeffler of
Texas told reporters. ``We're saying what we're going to do. ...
The Democratic platform reflects `Be quiet. Hide. Hide.'''

   Shops in Burma reopened today and
streets filled with people cheering the resignation of hard-line
leader Sein Lwin, but some skirmishes were reported near Rangoon,
travelers and news reports said.
   ``Burma's Hitler was brought down by the might of all the
people,'' Japan's Kyodo News Agency quoted one Burmese as saying.
``It was late in coming but it's only natural that the most
unpopular person is overthrown,'' said another.
   Brett B. Lambert, an American student returning from Rangoon,
said posters on walls of the capital showed Sein Lwin with blood
flowing from his mouth, a skull and crossbones around his face, and
``massacre'' written beneath.
   He said there were more cars on the streets today and shops
opened their doors to streams of customers. ``People are smiling
and happy,'' Lambert said.
   Western diplomats contacted in Rangoon said downtown areas were
quiet.
   ``We're in a kind of wait and see mode. The Burmese are very
relieved that Sein Lwin stepped down but basically skeptical about
what it all means,'' one of diplomat said. ``Is this cosmetic or is
it a real concession to the demonstrators?'' The diplomats spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Kyodo said troops had withdrawn from the city and tensions eased
after four days of anti-government protests that left at least 95
people dead. Western diplomats said hundreds may have died in the
fighting, and unconfirmed reports said up to 1,000 were killed
during the disturbances. Rangoon, a city of 3.5 million, had been
under a daytime curfew since Tuesday.
   Peter Swan, an Australian film maker returning from Rangoon,
said in an interview that he visited the Rangoon General Hospital
and saw more than 300 people wounded from the demonstrations.
   News reports said students continued passing out leaflets today
calling for protests to win democracy.
   The diplomats said there were reports of minor skirmishes in the
eastern suburb of Okkalapa and unconfirmed reports of looting and
shooting in the working-class area where some of the fiercest
fighting took place last week.
   Sein Lwin stepped down Friday after 17 days in power. He quit
amid reports that Burmese soldiers were turning against the
government and allowing people to march through some towns,
demanding democracy and economic reforms.
   Burma's official Rangoon Radio, which announced the resignation,
gave no reason for it and did not say Sein Lwin's successor would
be.
   Lambert said that prior to the announcement of the resignation,
troops moved through Rangoon in large numbers with armored
personnel carriers.
   After the radio broadcast, the soldiers stationed around the
hotel where he was staying withdrew. But he said a number of
Burmese told him ``it was not over yet,'' and that much depended on
who would be Sein Lwin's successor.
   Josef Silverstein, a leading American expert on Burma, said by
telephone that a likely candidate was Kyaw Htin, a relatively
liberal military officer.
   Kyaw Htin, who received some military training in the United
States, has been No. 3 in the government and party.
   Diplomats in Rangoon said prices were soaring and food was
running low, with barely any transportation into the city from the
countryside. Hospitals, which normally function at threadbare
levels, were reported running seriously short of blood, bandages
and other vital medical supplies.
   Even if peace returns to Burma, economic recovery is expected to
be slow and difficult. Once one of the world's wealthiest nations,
Burma is now listed as among the world's poorest with a per capita
income of less than $200 a year.
   The economic problems were brought on by the isolationist
policies of Ne Win, who ruled Burma for 26 years. He resigned last
month, citing student unrest in March and June, and Sein Lwin was
elected his successor July 26.
   Students, monks, workers and other filled the streets of Rangoon
almost immediately, demanding Sein Lwin's ouster. They blamed the
former general for brutally crushing the March and June unrest and
cited his bloody suppression of Rangoon University riots after the
1962 coup.
   The protests spread to two dozen other cities. On Tuesday,
soldiers began firing into mobs of demonstrators.
   Reports from Burma indicated security forces in at least two
towns had sided with the protesters, and a guerrilla leader waging
his own war against the government called for a coordinated
nationwide offensive.

   A 6-year-old boy taking part in a
swimming class drowned in a city pool where five lifeguards were on
duty, officials said.
   ``We simply don't know what happened,'' said Public Works
Director Mike Dooley, who added that the guards and other city
employees were traumatized by the drowning Friday.
   Christopher A. Martin, son of Allan and Mary Martin of Sioux
City, was found floating face down in about six feet of water at
Lewis Pool, where he and about 40 other children were taking a
swimming lesson.
   A lifeguard tried to revive the boy, but he was pronounced dead
at Marion Health Center an hour later.
   Dooley said interviews were being conducted to see how the
accident happened. The children had been taking their final lesson
of the course.
   For ``everyone from the guards at the pool to those who sell
swim passes, it has been a most traumatic experience,'' Dooley said.
   The five guards, all certified by the Red Cross for lifeguard
duty, were all taken off the job and offered counseling, he said.
Two instructor aides were also in the pool area at the time.

   A man woke up to the sound of his
neighbors' house burning, rushed over and roused them from sleep,
then grabbed a ladder and helped the couple and their dog escape.
   ``He's a fantastic person _ I'll tell you, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him,'' Rosemary Foster said as she stood outside
the burned shell of her home Thursday night.
   ``It's just what a neighbor does for a neighbor,'' said Armand
Rodrigue. Rodrigue realized something was amiss when he heard a
popping sound at about 2:45 a.m. Thursday. The sound came from
exploding propane containers as fire ripped through the home of
Mrs. Foster and her husband, Walter, three houses down from
Rodrigue's house.
   ``I got in my truck and went over,'' Rodrigue said. ``I beeped
the horn to try to wake them up.''
   When the couple awoke and yelled for help from their
second-floor window, Rodrigue said, ``I broke the front door screen
with a piece of pipe, then kicked the front door in. But the smoke
was real bad, so I couldn't get in.''
   Foster then broke the upstairs window and Rodrigue grabbed a
ladder that lay alongside the house. He helped Mrs. Foster down,
then helped Foster, who was carrying the couple's dog, Trouble.
   Fire Chief Kenneth Calvin said Rodrigue's action saved the
Fosters' lives.
   The fire, controlled about 45 minutes after Rodrigue rescued the
couple, caused about $65,000 in damage.

<HEAD>Anger Control Training Helps Aggressive Schoolboys Avoid Later
Drug Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boys who were aggressive in elementary school but
were taught to cope with anger showed significantly less alcohol
and drug use three years later than untrained aggressive boys did,
a study has found.
   Their drug use was only a quarter of that reported by untrained
boys, and measures of marijuana and alcohol use generally ran about
half of those for the untrained boys, researcher John Lochman said.
   The treated boys showed improved self-esteem, which may have
removed one reason for using drugs, Lochman said. They also had
improved problem-solving skills, which may have prepared them to
make more careful, less impulsive decisions about using drugs and
alcohol, he said.
   Lochman, of Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.,
reported his results Friday at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association.
   ``It's a very, very promising piece of research,'' said F.
Daniel Armstrong of the Mailman Center for Child Development in
Miami, after the presentation.
   Previous work has found that high levels of childhood aggression
can predict later substance abuse and antisocial behavior.
   Lochman's study involved 41 boys who had gone through an anger
coping program between 1981 and 1984 after their teachers rated
them highly aggressive and disruptive.
   It also included 59 aggressive boys who had not gone through the
training, and 68 who had been rated nonaggressive by their teachers.
   By the time of the follow-up study, their average age was 14.9
years. The two groups of aggressive children were similar in racial
composition, achievement, and levels of aggression and
socioeconomic status at the time they were originally rated
aggressive.
   About 10 percent of boys in a typical elementary school
classroom are aggressive, Lochman said in an interview.
   They include not only bullies but also children who react
aggressively to perceived slights from others. They tend not to be
assertive verbally, relying too much instead on physical action, he
said.
   The anger coping program focused on how to solve problems
without physical aggression when faced with provoking situations
with peers and teachers.
   The weekly sessions were conducted during school hours, with
four to six boys at a time. Each boy attended for four to five
months.
   When followed up 2.5 to 3.5 years later, boys who had gone
through the treatment showed significantly less drug involvement,
fewer arguments with family or teachers because of alcohol, and
less alcohol drinking than untreated aggressive boys did. They also
tended to have less involvement with marijuana.
   However, the treatment made no difference at the follow-up time
for classroom behavior problems and parental ratings of the child's
aggression, Lochman said.
   Further analysis showed that a second dose of training, which
some of the children had gone through, eased later behavioral
problems, pointing up the need for follow-up training, Lochman said.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Strengthens Iraqi Ruler</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraqis fired in the air and danced in the
streets last week to celebrate a cease-fire in the war with Iran,
signs that President Saddam Hussein has emerged from the eight-year
conflict stronger than ever.
   The 51-year-old ruler, a pragmatic populist utterly ruthless to
his foes, now can return to his dream of making oil-rich Iraq a
modern economic and political power.
   The struggle with Iran was Hussein's war. Iraq invaded Iran in
September 1980, only a year after he came to power, after border
skirmishes.
   On July 18, Iran accepted a U.N. cease-fire resolution that Iraq
accepted soon after it was passed a year ago. The cease-fire is set
to begin officially on Aug. 20.
   Iraq's state-run information services are doing all they can to
declare victory. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis flooded the
streets to dance and fire weapons, responding to government calls
to celebrate ``the day of peace and victory.''
   Only 18 months ago, Iranian forces were pounding at the defenses
of Iraq's second city, Basra, and foreign analysts suggested Iraq
might crack. Western newspapers suggested outsiders should topple
Hussein to fulfill Iranian demands for halting the war.
   Instead, the war seems to have ended in a string of Iraqi
victories over an Iranian war machine drained by the costly attacks
on Basra.
   Hussein holds the loyalty of Iraq's ethnically mixed population
despite a war that cost hundreds of thousands of lives and hundreds
of billions of dollars.
   Before the war, the president already had a firm grip on power
in Iraq, plagued by political instability for years before the
Baath Party took control in 1968.
   Hussein quickly executed opponents within the leadership shortly
after assuming power in 1979 and crushed pro-Iranian religious
fundamentalists in 1980.
   Mindful of numerous coups against past governments and perhaps
his own past as an underground fighter, Hussein has used a huge
security service to keep watch over dissent.
   He also has promoted relatives to several key positions in the
government and military, although he has been quick to dump those
who proved incompetent or disloyal.
   ``The man who leads the Iraqis must be of a quick and nimble
pace,'' Hussein said in 1982, ``so the others will not step on his
heels, then his back, then step on his head and pass him over.''
   Hussein himself took part in an unsuccessful 1959 assassination
attempt against then-President Abdul-Karim Qassem.
   The son of poor farmers, Hussein has combined an iron hand with
a populist appeal. He has a reputation for hard work, bravery and
personal honesty.
   State television often spends a half hour or more showing the
president sitting on a floor chatting with peasants or bouncing
children on his knee. The government has encouraged a cult of
personality around him.
   Yet Hussein told American researcher Christine Helms in 1982
that after watching party members scrambling for power in the
mid-1960s: ``I developed an aversion to power. ... I began to
loathe it.''
   Hussein's outlook was forged by his climb through the
underground politics of the Baath Party, which advocates Arab
unity, socialist economics and rejection of foreign domination.
   His policies are essentially pragmatic. He told Ms. Helms he
``did not think I had to be basically concerned'' with ideology
until 1974, when he was already a senior force in the party.
   Hussein has gradually improved ties with the West and has
demanded attention to profits and discipline in the country's
sluggish state enterprises.
   He is also supremely self-confident. In 1964, still in his 20s,
he led a revolt against the old party leadership, which was in
disarray after being driven from power.
   While in hiding, ``I issued a communique on behalf of the
party's provisional regional command, which did not exist, giving
myself the authority to lead the party,'' he told Helms.
   The war interrupted Hussein's massive effort to use Iraq's oil
wealth to make the country a modern power.
   ``He has lost 10-odd years of his rule in which he could have
literally transformed the country,'' said a senior diplomat in
Baghdad who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``They have given a glimpse of the future to their masses,'' and
with the war over, ``I think they will be in a hurry to start
building,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi officials have created one of the
world's strongest personality cults around President Saddam Hussein.
   Massive murals and portraits of the president peer down over
streets throughout the country. Television is dominated by songs in
praise of the president or film of his visits to the countryside.
   Hussein's photograph beams from the front page of every
newspaper. Airports, art galleries, sports tournaments and literary
prizes are named for him.
   Poets and singers often recite his praises for hours a day on
the television.
   Even the eight-year war with Iran was called ``Saddam's
Qadissiyeh,'' a reference to the 7th century triumph of Islamic
armies in Iraq over the Persian predecessors of modern Iran.
   Members of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party must take tests
on the president's works. Diplomats say criticism of the president
can lead to prison.
   Hussein himself commented on the strength of this cult of
personality in a 1983 interview with Kuwaiti reporters. In the
interview, published by Iraq's state printing house, he insisted he
did not inspire the cult.
   ``For seven years now I have been pressing them (information
media) hard to slow down where the topic of Saddam Hussein is
concerned,'' he said. ``They answer by saying that Saddam Hussein
must be a symbol to all Iraqis.
   ``There are several religions, sects and ethnic groups in Iraq.
Consequently, our media have to take this factor into consideration
and arrange matters in such a way that each of these groups has a
share ... in the person of Saddam Hussein.
   ``Have you come across an Iraqi child, in a kindergarten or at
school, that does not mention the name of Saddam Hussein in the
nursery rhyme or the school song he or she sings? Is there a poet
with a poem that does not mention the name of Saddam Hussein X
number of times? Have you heard of a peasant who does not mention
the name of Saddam Hussein when mentioning the revolution?'' he
said in the interview.
   ``You may speak to the Iraqi women, particularly those who are
widows of martyrs. They will tell you that their husbands have
given their lives in honor of, and in sacrifice to, not the
homeland but first to Saddam Hussein, then the homeland and then
the revolution.
   ``We are in fact experiencing difficulty in asking kindergarten
children and schoolboys and girls to leave the name of Saddam
Hussein from the wordings of their rhymes and songs,'' Hussein said
in the interview.
   ``If the case we are talking about were not truly genuine,
people would not tolerate it for more than six months at most,
after which it would be thrown overboard.''

<TEXT>
   Vice President Salvador Laurel on
Saturday accused President Corazon Aquino's government of
corruption and incompetence and urged her to resign and call new
elections.
   In a four-page letter to the president, Laurel said conditions
in the Philippines had gone ``from bad to worse'' since Mrs. Aquino
was swept to power in the 1986 civilian-military revolt that ousted
President Ferdinand Marcos. He said Mrs. Aquino failed to curb
corruption or stem the 19-year communist rebellion.
   Laurel said that if Mrs. Aquino resigned, he would step down
too. But he said that if she refused to quit, he would leave her
coalition government while remaining vice president, an elected
post.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to comment on Laurel's resignation call, but
accused her vice president of withholding support for her during
two major coup attempts.
   Last September, Laurel, 59, quit as foreign secretary and
refused to serve in the Cabinet, citing ``fundamental differences''
with Mrs. Aquino.
   Since then, the vice president's political base has eroded
steadily. Twenty-one of the 22 members of his party in the House of
Representatives are reportedly preparing to defect to pro-Aquino
parties.
   Laurel read his letter to reporters at a news conference:
   ``Madame President: The time has come to tell our people with
humility and candor that the presidency itself is the problem _
because the task requires a higher level of competence _ in the
face of the advancing communist insurgency, the breakdown of law
and order, the resurgence of widespread corruption, the
paralyzation of political will and the growing desperation of our
people.
   ``We need a leadership that does not only preach boldly, but
sternly and courageously enforces public order and public morality
... without regard to the toll levied upon one's popularity,''
Laurel said. ``That leadership you have promised, but have failed
to deliver to our people.''
   The next presidential elections are slated for May 1992.
   Laurel's election call generated little support among political
leaders.
   Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the country's chief opposition figure,
said he would meet Laurel soon to forge a new alliance. But he
stopped short of endorsing another election.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, who has criticized some of Mrs. Aquino's
policies, said he opposed Laurel's demand. ``While the president
has her deficiencies ... her stepping down will not solve our
problems and may even compound them,'' he said.
   Sen. Edgardo Angara, a conservative member of the Aquino
coalition, said the country needs unity, not new elections.
   Laurel, a boyhood friend of Mrs. Aquino's late husband Benigno
Aquino Jr., accused the president of ignoring his advice and of
breaking a promise to name him prime minister.
   Mrs. Aquino appointed Laurel prime minister in 1986 but
abolished the post soon afterward.
   Mrs. Aquino told reporters Saturday that Laurel's influence had
declined since she took office, but she said Laurel himself was to
blame.
   ``I would just like him to understand that when I need his
support, it seems he is not prepared to give it,'' she said.
   In a November 1986 coup attempt, Aquino said, Laurel was playing
golf. She said that in an August 1987 coup attempt in which at
least 53 people were killed, Laurel withheld a public statement of
support until military rebels were defeated.
   Laurel, scion of one of the country's most influential families,
announced his candidacy for president in the February 1986 election
against Marcos. He withdrew and agreed to run for vice president
after the Roman Catholic hierarchy and others told him only Mrs.
Aquino could unite the factious opposition.
   Mrs. Aquino ran under Laurel's UNIDO banner. Marcos claimed
victory in the balloting but fled into exile in Hawaii after the
uprising.
   Some of Mrs. Aquino's supporters also say her government lacks
direction and leadership.
   Last month, the man who persuaded Mrs. Aquino to run for
president, newspaper publisher Joacquin Roces, said the government
had lost sight of its goals of justice and social reform.
   Solicitor-General Francisco Chavez has charged rampant
corruption within the Presidential Commission on Good Government,
which Mrs. Aquino organized to recover the billions of dollars
Marcos allegedly stole in office.
   On Thursday, Mrs. Aquino fired her national food director after
an investigation found irregularities in his department but cleared
him of wrongdoing.
   Communist rebels have expanded to most of the country's 73
provinces, and urban guerrillas and right-wing death squads carry
out street assassinations in Manila and other major cities.

<TEXT>
   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ The people of Africa's last
colony, war-weary and deeply skeptical after 22 years of fighting,
see major obstacles to independence despite South African proposals
to withdraw.
   South Africa joined an Angolan war cease-fire Aug. 8, said it
will pull out of Angola by Sept. 1, and tentatively plans to begin
withdrawing Nov. 1 from neighboring South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   South Africa has offered to grant Namibia independence on June 1
if Cuba agrees to remove its 50,000 troops from Angola by then.
   Namibia has been ruled by Germans and South Africans for more
than a century, and most of its people are aching for peace and
independence.
   But they have had their hopes repeatedly raised and dashed ever
since the U.N. Security Council in 1978 passed Resolution 435
calling for Namibian independence and U.N.-supervised elections.
   ``The words we are hearing today are the same words we heard 10
years ago,'' said Danny Tjongarero, a spokesman for the legal
poltical wing of the South-West Africa People's Organization. ``I'd
like to be optimistic, but South Africa has proved ingenious in
finding excuses to block Namibian independence.''
   SWAPO's outlawed guerrilla movement has been fighting since 1966
to win independence for the mineral-rich territory, which is larger
than France and West Germany combined but has only 1.3 million
residents. SWAPO is considered likely to win independence elections
due to its strong support in the north, where most of the
population is concentrated.
   South Africa calls SWAPO a terrorist organization intent on
establishing a Marxist state. Many Namibians doubt South Africa's
sincerity in proposing elections within a year that are likely to
lead to SWAPO government.
   South Africa, with backing from the United States, argues that
Namibian independence must be linked with the Cuban withdrawal from
Angola.
   The Cubans support Angola's Marxist government in the
13-year-old Angolan war, while the United States and South Africa
aid the UNITA rebel movement.
   South Africa, Cuba, Angola and U.S. mediators plan to hold more
talks the week of Aug. 22 in a bid to establish a date for the
Cuban withdrawal and independence for Namibia. Without an
agreement, Namibian independence plans appear headed for another
derailment.
   Namibian leaders have been excluded from the peace talks and
have been briefed by the South Africans only after proposals and
agreements have been announced.
   ``We know all the participants in the talks still have tricks up
their sleeve,'' @said Andreas Shipanga, a black Cabinet minister in
Namibia's multiracial interim government, established in 1985 to
pave the road for independence.
   Asked if he thought Namibia would be independent by June 1,
Shipanga said: ``I'd like to hope so, but I don't believe so.''
   South Africa has contributed to the skepticism by sending
conflicting signals about its intentions in Namibia.
   South African President P.W. Botha paid a rare visit to Namibia
in April and reiterated his government's commitment to white
``group rights,'' which allow for ethnically based political
structures and segregated schools and hospitals.
   Botha also extended the powers of Louis Pienaar, the territory's
appointed admistrator general. Most Namibians condemned the actions
and said they show South Africa intends to maintain a firm grip on
the territory it has administered since capturing it from Germany
in 1915.
   The League of Nations in 1920 authorized South Africa to govern
the territory, but the League's successor, the United Nations,
revoked the mandate in 1966.
   South Africa's offer to grant independence June 1 marks the
first time it has set a target date for leaving Namibia.
   But South Africa also raised several unresolved questions, such
as who will help pay Namibia's bills and guarantee its loans once
South Africa departs.
   The announcement caught many in Namibia by surprise. Some say a
sudden rush to independence could lead to chaos in a territory that
has more than 40 political parties and 11 ethnic groups ranging
from the nomadic Bushmen to a 20,000-strong German community.
   ``The whites are very worried and you will see an exodus to some
extent,'' said Kosie Pretorius, a Cabinet minister and head of the
all-white National Party. ``We are concerned about the economy,
about losing our cultural identity and about being dominated by a
black majority government.''
   When it appeared Namibia was close to independence in 1978,
about 25,000 whites, or 25 percent of the white population, fled
the territory. Most went to South Africa.
   The 75,000 remaining whites make up only 6 percent of the
population, but they pay almost 90 percent of the personal income
taxes and run the mining industry, the country's largest source of
revenue.
   ``We can't afford to scare whites out of Namibia and open
ourselves to destabilization,'' said Moses Katjiuongua, a black
Cabinet minister.
   ``Independence will create its own problems, but we can't go
backwards now,'' he said. ``We've already had too many
frustrations.''

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of townspeople
set up barriers, parked buses in streets and blocked roads with
market stalls Saturday to prevent opponents of U.S. military bases
from rallying near a Navy base.
   Police said about 30,000 people, including vendors and bar
waitresses, faced off against about 5,000 anti-base protesters on
the outskirts of Olongapo, a town about 50 miles west of Manila
that houses the Subic Bay Naval Base. A city official estimated the
crowd at closer to 60,000.
   At least one protester was injured when the convoy he was
traveling in was stoned a few miles near Olongapo.
   The townspeople, many of whom depend on the Subic base for their
livelihood, snarled traffic for several hours as they blocked all
roads to the base, preventing a 50-vehicle convoy of protesters
from entering town.
   ``Olongaponians love peace and order, so please don't bother
us,'' said one of the placards carried by the townspeople. ``We beg
you not to disturb the peace in Olongapo'' said another. Residents,
some cursing, warned the demonstrators to ``go home or else.''
   Some of the townspeople parked buses in the middle of streets to
block traffic, and market vendors used their stalls as roadblocks.
Riot police stood between the two groups to prevent clashes.
   Olongapo has 250,000 residents, including thousands of
prostitutes, bartenders and dancers working in bars and hotels near
the U.S. base. The local economy depends not only on the base but
on port calls by ships.
   At the Subic base, about one mile from the confrontation site,
heavily armed Filipino and U.S. troops guarded the gates, which
were buffered by several rows of barbed-wire barricades.
   The demonstrators left after several hours and promised to
``return to enlighten the minds of the Olongapo residents.''
   On Friday, 2,000 students and some Roman Catholic nuns marched
to the Clark Air Base in the nearby city of Angeles to demand that
U.S. military facilities in the country be closed. After an
all-night vigil, they moved on to Subic.
   Clark and Subic are the largest U.S. military bases outside the
United States. About 40,000 service personnel, Defense Department
civilians and military dependents are stationed at Clark, Subic and
four smaller installations in the Philippines.
   President Corazon Aquino has come under increasing pressure from
leftists, government officials and opposition leaders not to renew
the 1947 bases agreement. She has agreed to honor the lease through
1991 but refuses to say if she will support an extension.
   U.S. and Filipino panels have been negotiating in the
Philippines for more than four months on terms to apply during the
agreement's last two years.
   The Manila government is demanding that compensation for the
bases be increased to $1.2 billion annually, according to sources
close to the talks.
   The United States currently provides $180 million a year in
military and economic aid in exchange for continued use of the
bases.
   Government sources say the United States is not willing to pay
such an increase unless it is assured the bases will be allowed to
remain beyond 1991.

   The state has revoked the officer's commission
of a railroad policeman who was videotaped strolling naked through
Grand Central Terminal and taunting a homeless person.
   However, it was unclear if the officer, Sgt. Richard DeClara,
would keep his job with the Metro-North Commuter Railroad in the
wake of Friday's announcement that his state commission was taken
away.
   The railroad suspended DeClara and six other officers earlier
this month after the existence of the homemade tape was made public.
   The tape was made on the night of St. Patrick's Day 1983, when
the landmark railroad terminal was mostly deserted because of a
strike. DeClara was the focus of the tape, with the other officers
appearing in the background or being heard on the soundtrack.
   DeClara was shown harassing a black homeless man with racial
taunts, imitating a lisping stereotype of a homosexual and walking
nude except for his hat, tie, holster and shoes.
   The Railroad Police Benevolent Association said the tape was
``just horseplay among the various participants.'' The union has
said it intends to fight any disciplinary action.
   State Superintendent of Police Thomas Constantine has said
previously that if he revokes an officer's commission, ``that means
they would no longer have police powers and if that happens, then
Metro-North probably would not continue them in employment.''
   Metro-North President Peter Stangl said in a statement that he
was ``delighted'' by Friday's announcement and was looking forward
to ``the commissioner's expeditious action'' on the cases of the
six other suspended officers.
   The union contract with Metro-North states that disciplinary
action must be brought within 30 days after a commanding officer
learns of the alleged wrongdoing.
   In this case, at least one commander knew about the tape in
1985, the railroad acknowledged. The railroad, however, plans to
begin dismissal hearings on Monday.
   DeClara has an unlisted telephone number and could not be
reached for comment. In the past, he has described the video as ``a
comedy-type tape ... just strictly for laughs.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Says It Still Provides Classified Data To Contractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is still giving security-cleared
industry representatives access over the table to classified
documents for bidding on sensitive projects despite allegations of
bribes to get secret information.
   Responding to an inquiry by The Associated Press, the Defense
Department said it still has a long-standing policy under which
contractors with a ``valid need to know'' can obtain entire
``descriptive summaries'' of futuristic research and development
projects.
   The open information-sharing system apparently has operated
alongside the clandestine arrangements between consultants and
Pentagon employees that have been the subject of a 2-year-old
federal investigation of contracting abuse.
   The investigation is searching for evidence that those using the
under-the-table system bribed Defense Department officials to
obtain top-secret information _ including plans of one contractor
that could be sold to another. This material is far more sensitive
than that given out in the open system, according to private
lawyers familiar with the practice.
   The AP had asked the Pentagon whether the voluntary system to
supply consultants and contractors with classified information _ to
help them through an unworkable bidding process _ still exists as
described by a DoD official in 1984 court testimony.
   The written response provided by the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) was that ``the policy and procedures were
the same'' going back to at least 1982. The agency writes ``wish
lists'' for future military projects.
   Questions about the policy were posed to that agency because one
of its program management officers, Caroline A. Chewning, testifed
about the Pentagon's cooperation with private industry
representatives in 1984.
   She said they were ``unofficially'' given classified material
because ``It's in the government's best interest that contractors
have this information. If they had to go to `official channels,' it
may take them six months to get them. You're on a tight contract
award basis, and you don't have time for that.''
   Ms. Chewning added, ``We must cooperate with private industry or
else we are hurting. We depend on private industry to build our
systems.''
   The Pentagon response to the inquiry focused on contractors'
needs for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation documents,
which include descriptive summaries of numerous individual programs
for present and future years.
   ``Some of the large RDT&E-oriented contractors, such as
aerospace and electronics companies, have research and development
projects and contracts that cut across most if not all of the
technology fields supported by DARPA.
   ``It is thus conceivable that such a contractor could have a
valid need to know for the entire agency descriptive summary in
order to propose research in many of the agency's fields of
interest,'' the Pentagon said.
   Specialized contractors, the Pentagon said, would only have a
need to know the information regarding their fields of competence.
   Theplanning and
budget information only after clearance level, storage capability,
and need-to-know are all demonstrated.''
   The individual receiving the information must be found
``trustworthy,'' have the appropriate security clearance, and show
a ``demonstrated need to know.''
   The open system of giving documents to industry representatives
has not been widely discussed. Ms. Chewning testified that her
``mouth fell open'' when a contractor she had never met called to
ask her for an interpretation of a document she had written.
   She said ``95 to 99 percent'' of the information that
consultants and contractors sought from her section was willingly
handed out.

   George Bush knows all about the frantic
suspense surrounding late announcements of a presidential nominee's
running mate. He got his own 11th-hour call from Ronald Reagan in
1980.
   Now, he's doing his best to keep a dozen or so Republicans on
the same edge.
   With his silence on a vice presidential choice, Bush is
providing the only element of suspense in an otherwise suspenseless
Republican National Convention.
   Bush says he hopes to make up his mind before he gets to New
Orleans _ even if he doesn't announce that decision until Wednesday
or Thursday _ but aides insist the vice president still has not
decided.
   He was working on his campaign acceptance speech Saturday while
still keeping his own counsel on the vice presidential selection
process.
   ``It's all being done mainly by the vice president,'' said his
campaign manager, Lee Atwater. The campaign's pollster, Robert
Teeter, is ``helping him to a certain extent on the process,'' but
even he won't know in advance whom Bush will select, Atwater said.
   Nor will his new campaign manager, James A. Baker III, who was
out of town on Saturday, Atwater and other campaign aides suggested.
   ``He's made it clear to all of us that he wants to make this
decision on his own,'' Atwater said. ``He knows the players; he
knows the candidates. And he's ultimately going to make the
decision himself. And I don't anticipate he's going to share it
with anybody except maybe his wife on Wednesday.''
   On that score, Bush has joked that if he talks in his sleep in
the meantime, ``we could be in real trouble.''
   So the waiting game goes on for the dozen or so ``players''
known to be under what campaign aides call ``active consideration.''
   These run across the full spectrum of Republicans, both
geographically and politically:
   _Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., Bush's principal former rival for the
GOP nomination. His strongest point, say Bush campaign aides, is
his popularity across the Midwest. But these aides also say they
are fearful that Democrats would seize on Dole's bitter attacks on
Bush during the primary campaigns to use as campaign ammuniton.
   _Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., another vanquished primary rival but a
favorite among conservatives. Campaign aides say Kemp could also
help bring in blue-collar Democratic votes and would help with
California, but they see his inability to muster votes in the GOP
primaries as a drawback.
   _Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., the assistant Senate Republican
leader and a longtime close friend and fishing partner of Bush. He
could help in the West, but Simpson himself has suggested his
previous support for freezing Social Security benefit increases
could be a liability.
   _Sen. Dan Quayle, R-Ind., a dark-horse contender added to the
list more recently. Bush campaign aides suggest he is being
seriously considered, both as a fresh face and for his base in the
Midwest.
   _Elizabeth Hanford Dole, former transportation secretary and the
wife of Bob Dole, who appears to be the only woman remaining under
consideraton from an original list that included Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum of Kansas, Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
   _Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., the top-ranking Budget Committee
Republican who has earned a reputation for deficit-fighting. With
his Italian name, he could also bring ethnic appeal to the ticket.
But some Republicans feel he's too open to a tax increase.
   _Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey and Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh, who is a former governor of Pennsylvania. Aides suggest
both men could help bring in the votes of moderates.
   Financial data has also been requested from New Hampshire Gov.
John Sununu, South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo.
   Govs. George Deukmejian of California and James Thompson of
Illinois had figured in earlier speculation, but both have asked
that they not be considered.
   Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, the first black ever to hold the post
of national security adviser, was not among the candidates Bush
campaign officials indicated were under active consideration. But
his name his turned up as a long-shot contender in some recent
speculation.
   Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, a moderate Republican and Bush adviser,
said that Bush was making the ``right choice'' in holding off a
decision, although he added: ``I don't think he's decided. It's
easy to hold off something if you haven't made your choice.''
   Bush himself was selected as Reagan's running mate late on the
next-to-final day of the 1980 Republican convention, only after
negotiations to select former President Ford for the No. 2 spot had
broken down.
   ``I hope I'll make as good a choice, but I think I'll use a
different method,'' Bush has quipped. He has said he hopes his
process _ including delaying a final decision until almost the last
minute _ will not be ``demeaning to any of the people'' under
consideration.
   In his 1987 autobiography, Bush quotes Mark Twain on the subject
of the vice presidency: ``Two brothers: one went to sea and the
other became vice president. Neither was ever heard from again.''
   Still, Bush adds, ``The message is clear: Although everybody
belittles the office of the vice president, not many people turn it
down.''
   Choosing a vice president ``has always been one of the most
unpredictable rituals of modern American politics,'' the vice
president wrote.

   With an actor's grace and a politician's
flair, President Reagan's farewell to the party he returned to the
White House is designed to avoid stealing the show from the new
standardbearer, George Bush.
   Reagan himself insisted on delivering his speech to the
Republican National Convention on Monday instead of later in the
week, where it might draw attention from Bush, officials say.
   The two men will appear together at the Belle Chasse Naval Air
Station just before Reagan's departure on Tuesday, but it will be
only a brief appearance.
   ``This is his (Reagan's) swan song. The convention will be awash
with nostalgia,'' says Rep. Guy Vander Jagt, head of the National
Republican Congressional Committee. ``But it has to end on a note
of looking to the future, sending off the man we hope will be
president for the next eight years.''
   It will be an emotional time for the man who appeared in several
motion pictures, hosted ``Death Valley Days'' and ``GE Theater''
and burst onto the national scene during the 1964 convention that
nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona for president.
   Reagan, who led the GOP to the White House in 1980 in a bitter
defeat for President Jimmy Carter, faces a bittersweet transition
as a 77-year-old president with little beyond Bush's election on
his remaining agenda. In retirement, he plans to speak for repeal
of the 22nd Amendment limiting presidents to two terms.
   The White House gave Reagan the leading role he rarely got as a
Hollywood actor. And he's relished this attention. But a
performer's feel for stage positioning convinced Reagan that Bush
must stand without him for Thursday's climatic convention moments,
party and campaign officials say.
   So the GOP passed up the chance to have the nation see Bush
hoist his arms in a unity show with Reagan. However, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said tentative plans call for Reagan and
Bush to meet on Tuesday at Belle Chase Naval Air Station, as Reagan
is leaving the convention city and Bush is arriving.
   Republican Party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf, talking of Reagan's
Monday night speech, said, ``I think we're going to see a very
proud man _ proud of the accomplishments of the last seven years.''
   ``Ronald Reagan at his age looks as good if not better than he
did when he came into office,'' Fahrenkopf said. ``Ronald Reagan is
an individual who knows who he is and is comfortable with who he
is. That's why, in many ways, Ronald Reagan doesn't have an ego
problem.''
   A source who participated in talks about the presidential role
in New Orleans, discussing a conversation on grounds of anonymity,
said Reagan at one point this spring argued forcefully about which
day he would speak.
   ``Initially it was penciled in that he would do the speech on
Tuesday night,'' this source said. ``But he realizes that wherever
he goes, he's the focus of media attention. This was his decision.
He said, `I don't want to do it Tuesday. I want to do it Monday.'''
   Gov. Thomas Kean's keynote address was thus put off until
Tuesday, as party strategists sought to make Reagan's valedictory
and Bush's coming out party politically compatible and graceful.
   Mitchell Daniels, White House political adviser in earlier
Reagan years, said ``no one is more conscious of the need for this
to be a George Bush convention than Ronald Reagan.''
   ``He'll be very comfortable with the balance that has been
struck,'' said Daniels, a Hudson Institute scholar who's going to
the convention as a delegate from Indiana. ``A lesser man would
have insisted on a bigger share of the limelight.''
   Said Vander Jagt, R-Mich., ``The challenge is to make `Hello!'
to George Bush as exciting as `Goodbye!' to Ronald Reagan.''
   From a variety of Republican sources, declining to be named
publicly, the Reagan itinerary in New Orleans will go like this:
   The president and his wife Nancy will arrive on Sunday, have
dinner with several members of the family and renew some political
acquaintances. On Monday, Mrs. Reagan will be the guest of honor at
a luncheon being organized by the president's daughter, Maureen
Reagan. On Monday night, former Sen. Paul Laxalt, R-Nev., will
deliver a testimonial to his longtime friend. Mrs. Reagan will
precede her husband on the podium, speaking briefly to the 2,277
convention delegates.
   After that, there will be a film presentation on the Reagan
presidency. The president will arrive on the podium while delegates
are watching the film in darkness, to await his reception when the
lights go back on.
   He'll address a fund-raising breakfast away from the convention
hotel Tuesday morning and then head to his vacation ranch in the
Santa Ynez Mountains of California.
   Reagan, who reminded the 1984 Dallas convention it was ``the
last time'' he would address such a gathering as a candidate, has
said people should be able to elect a president as often as they
wish.
   But he also has said he was never interested in a seeking a
third term.
   James David Barber, a Duke University presidential scholar, said
the mood at the New Orleans convention will likely be cheerful, but
also nostalgic.
   ``Nancy's counsel to him (Reagan) will be that, `This is the
last major speech that he'll make in a power situation, and
therefore it should be the best,'' Barber speculated. He said that
Mrs. Reagan seems to have ``a fundamental concern'' with how
history will judge her husband.
   ``There'll be a lot of cheers, a lot of tears'' when Reagan
speaks, said Donald Devine, a former head of the Office of
Personnel Management who now runs Citizens For America, a
self-styled grass-roots Reagan organization.
   ``I'm sure what's going on in their mind is, they don't want
Ronald Reagan to steal the scene, and that's a legitimate
consideration,'' Devine said. ``I think at first the president was
a little bit hesitant (about warmly embracing Bush's candidacy),
but I have do doubt that they are working together now.''

<TEXT>
   Boston is bracing for a decade-long overhaul of
its antiquated highway system and for the headaches that will go
with it, including the possibility of a torrent of rats being
unleashed by the ``big dig.''
   The $4.5 billion project includes a plan to build a third tunnel
under Boston Harbor and transform the Central Artery, Interstate 93
through downtown, from a six-lane elevated highway to an eight- to
10-lane underground expressway.
   Experts say that without the new design, 14-hour gridlocks could
someday develop. Construction officials promise a new, grander
Boston will emerge from the rubble and disarray that will begin
affecting motorists later this year.
   In place of the rusting, 29-year-old interstate that divides
downtown from Boston's North End and waterfront, officials envision
either a long, narrow park or small, controlled development above
the underground expressway.
   ``There will be a dramatic difference,'' said Martha Bailey,
manager for environment and design for the project. ``We're giving
the city the ability to reunite itself.''
   But Sam Wood, head of the city department known as the ``rat
patrol,'' warns that the construction will destroy the habitat of
millions of rats in underground burrows and old buildings and that
they could overrun the city.
   ``If someone doesn't take an aggressive stand and fight this
with a careful program and education, then it's going to be a bad
situation,'' Wood said.
   In Boston, there is one rat for every two people. A rat debacle
occurred during construction on the Southeast Expressway in 1984,
when rodents overran areas like the South End section of the city.
   ``People whisper about rats,'' Wood said. ``They don't want to
talk about them out loud. They're afraid of them. They don't want
to think about them.''
   Wood's Inspectional Services Rodent Control Department has asked
the state to fund a $500,000 anti-rat plan, including early baiting
and inspection. State officials are also planning to hire a rodent
expert.
   Ninety percent of the state-run construction project is being
funded by the Federal Highway Administration.
   Certain expressways will be limited to one and two lanes during
the construction, worsening Boston's already legendary traffic
crunch.
   To help ease the traffic, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority has been granted $3 billion to improve public
transportation. Officials are hoping to persuade motorists to take
trains, buses, subways and ferries to work.
   According to a survey last year, 39 percent of all commuters
said they plan to change the way they get into Boston and 54
percent who use the Central Artery said they will drive another
route.
   The third harbor tunnel will be four lanes wide and 4,200 feet
long when it is opened in 1994.
   The new, 3.9-mile expressway will carry traffic between the end
of the Massachusetts Turnpike, across South Boston and the city's
northeastern suburbs, past Logan International Airport.
   ``We have the opportunity to improve the urban character of the
city and give it more of a feel for open space,'' said City
Transportation Commissioner Richard Dimino. ``The city will lend
itself more to a walk in the park.''

   A private man in public life, George Bush
admits to discomfort in discussing such personal matters as his
family. Typically, he calls them ``our gang'' and reverts to terms
coaches use for their best players.
   As well they may be. For as Bush heads into the fall campaign
against Michael Dukakis, his energetic brood is being unleashed as
a formidable political weapon.
   ``We're not political pros, but we've got political seasoning,''
says George W. Bush, the vice president's eldest son and a top
campaign strategist, in what may be a bit of understatement.
   The Bushes are veterans of many years spent in the public eye as
Bush trekked from Congress to diplomatic posts, in China and at the
United Nations, to the CIA and then to the No. 2 spot at the White
House.
   His wife Barbara has been described as an indefatigable
campaigner who shrugs off talk about herself, such as that she dye
her white hair, but bristles when her husband is criticized.
   George Jr. has run for Congress, with brother Neil his campaign
manager, and his other siblings are active in grass-roots party
politics. All are delegates at the GOP convention in New Orleans.
And all are actively involved in trying to get their father to the
top spot in the White House.
   Heading into the fall campaign, the family is increasingly
``speaking out about love'' that they have for each other, as
George Jr. puts it. In short, all the publicity about warm Dukakis
family relationships have not been lost on Bush strategists.
   ``We've had a very close family for years,'' says George Jr.
``I'm glad they have one too.''
   His father, who says his proudest accomplishment is that ``our
children still come home,'' believes his clan will do fine in the
political battle of the families.
   ``We're just getting our gang out onto the field,'' he said
recently aboard Air Force II. ``We will do all right if it gets
onto that.''
   On one August weekend, the family was at the summer home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, taping television advertisements highlighting
their relationship. The vice president admits that's something he's
not quite comfortable with.
   ``I haven't advertised this as much as I think one has to these
days. But it's important to us, always has been. So we're not
trying to do something artificial. If I were hamming it up and
getting a bunch of disenchanted kids to come so we could have
pictures taken, that wouldn't be very good. But that's not what
happens when we're together,'' Bush says.
   By all accounts, the Bush family has always been competitive.
The time spent at the oceanfront Maine home is not idly whiled
away. There is tennis, horseshoes, other contests.
   ``They play games to win. They're very nice about it. It's
genteel but only up to a point. That tennis ball's coming over the
net about 90 miles an hour,'' says Thomas W. L. ``Lud'' Ashley, a
former Ohio congressman and a family friend for over 40 years.
   Ashley says Bush has ``never sported his family the way some
politicians do'' and adds that Bush and his wife Barbara are not
given to public displays like the Dukakises.
   The Bushes don't talk much about their sixth child, Robin, who
died at age 3 of leukemia. Bush, in his book ``Looking Forward,''
says that during her illness ``Barbara and I susained each other.''
   ``To this day, like every parent who has ever lost a child, we
wonder why; yet we know that, whatever the reason, she is in God's
loving arms,'' he writes.
   The other children were raised in what son Jeb has called ``a
matriarchal family.'' ``Dad wasn't home at night to play catch,''
he told an interviewer. ``Mom was always the one to hand out the
goodies and the discipline.''
   Mrs. Bush put it differently: ``Somebody has to take care of the
nest, and that's me.''
   The family has been protective when Bush has come under fire, as
he did during the administration's Iran-Contra affair. Barbara Bush
once said, ``There are only six things in this world you can't
criticize _ George Bush and my children. I am a mother hen that
way.''
   ``The family has been a source of great strength during the good
times as well as the bad times,'' says George Jr. ``When ugly
things are said about our dad, we tend to circle the wagons.''
   In the race toward November, the Bush clan will be circling the
country.
   George Jr., 42, says he'll be spending time in the Southwest.
His brother Neil, 33, who lives in Denver, will hit the West.
Brother Marvin, 31, who lives in Virginia, has the Southeast. Jeb,
35, leaves his job as Florida commerce secretary to handle southern
California. And sister Dorothy Bush LeBlond, 29, of Maine, will
handle the Northeast. They'll focus on what George Jr. calls ``the
secondary markets.''
   ``We can't expect to get air time in a big-city market, but when
you go to a city like Midland, Texas, my hometown, off the beaten
path, the people out there appreciate your coming and the media
appreciate it,'' says George Jr.

<HEAD>Man Attacked by Shark; Another Shark Sighted Off Stinson Beach</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A great white shark attacked a
surfer near the mouth of the Klamath River, and park rangers
started a ``shark patrol'' after a fisherman spotted another great
white 200 yards off a popular beach.
   ``He grabbed me, sucked me under water, and then let me go,''
said Carl Lafazio, who required 27 stitches in his right thigh
after the attack Thursday.
   Lafazio, 27, said after the shark bit him once, it came back for
a final assault but failed when he made it to shore with the help
of four friends. He was in stable condition at Sutter Coast
Hospital.
   About 250 miles south of Crescent City, officials at Marin
County's Stinson Beach, 15 miles north of San Francisco, said they
were taking seriously a fisherman's reported sighting of a great
white shark.
   Ranger Richard Danielsen said Friday a ``shark patrol'' will
continue through the weekend, but said the park district has
decided against issuing warnings about possible sharks in the
waters.
   If rangers in a 16-foot boat see a shark or find mangled seal
carcasses, they probably will close the beach, Danielsen said.
   Bruce Barsotti, 38, said he was at the wheel of his 25-foot
fishing boat Tuesday night when a shark about 13 feet long lunged
out of the water.
   ``I was stunned. I was just in awe ... I couldn't believe the
mouth on it,'' Barsotti said.

<HEAD>Dukakis Has Had Procurement Problems Of His Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis,
who cites the Pentagon purchasing scandal in almost every campaign
speech, oversees a procurement system described by the
Massachusetts inspector general as ``almost a standing invitation
to fraud, waste and abuse.''
   Inspector General Joseph Baressi, a fellow Democrat, has
delivered scathing attacks on three aspects of the state's
purchasing system: its procedures for buying supplies and
equipment, its guidelines for obtaining services through
consultants and its laws governing purchases by city, town,
district and county governments.
   A spokesman for the Massachusetts governor said many of the
problems have been corrected internally in recent months but
Baressi's office, while praising some of the steps taken to protect
against fraud, said only new laws will correct giant flaws in the
system.
   ``The commonweath routinely enters into large, ill-defined
endless contracts in which genuine competition is illusory and
money is no object,'' Baressi told the Legislature earlier this
year. ``Too often, the vendor is paid both to tell the state what
services to buy and then to sell those very services to the state
year after year.
   ``Except in the areas of construction bidding and designer
selection, the commonwealth's contracting procedures are almost a
standing invitation to fraud, waste and abuse.''
   Baressi's deputy, Stephen E. Cotton, gave a similar account of
exisiting state provisions governing procurement by local
governments, calling them ``vague, confusing, weak, arbitrary and
outdated.''
   Those criticisms are not unlike a comment by a former Pentagon
undersecretary that Dukakis has used recently in his campaign stump
speech.
   Quoting congressional testimony of the former official, David
Packard, Dukakis told several rallies that the Reagan
administration ``has helped create an environment in which, and I
quote, `honest and efficient military acquisition is impossible.'''
   He also blames the Pentagon scandal and other problems in the
Reagan administration on a ``contempt for public service'' and said
the president and Vice President George Bush must accept
responsibility.
   ``There's an old Greek saying and I suspect the Italians have
the same one: `You know, the fish rots from the head first.' It
starts from the top.''
   At home, Dukakis said ``I accept the responsibility'' for
problems in his administration, and said that chief executives are
from time to time hurt by the conduct of government workers.
   Massachusetts revised its contracting procedures for
construction and building design in 1980 after a special commission
found them riddled with faults that invited corruption. But the
state's procurement system _ which involves purchases well in
excess of $1 billion a year _ remains for the most part guided by a
1922 law.
   David Wood, a spokesman for the governor, said the state's new
purchasing agent, Rick Murphy, has implemented several internal
policy changes in the past eight months that he said ``virtually
eliminate fraud waste and abuse,'' among them the establishment of
a legal section that reviews purchasing agreements and a
requirement that all contracts be in writing.
   But Cotton, citing Murphy's support for legislation to revise
purchasing standards, said that the lack of a tough law will limit
the effectiveness of Murphy's internal efforts to improve the
system.
   ``The rules or rather the absence of rules create the
vulnerability,'' Cotton said.
   In the past year alone, there have been several cases in which
the state procurement laws have come under scrutiny.
   In April, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, the
agency charged with cleaning up Boston Harbor, put out a request
for bids that invited suppliers to make offers to sell the state
such items as trucks, electric tools, blades, bags, bars, signs and
drills _ without being more specific.
   In February, 19 people were indicted, included three current and
former state employees, for allegedly bilking the state Department
of Public Works of more than $350,000 by either overbilling or
submitting bills for work never done. Baressi has complained there
is a lack of safeguards in existing procurement laws to prevent
such fraud. Many of those charged in the case were private
consultants contracted by the department.
   Baressi also said in a report last year that many state agencies
have split purchases to deliberately circumvent requirements that
items costing more than $500 be put out for competitive bids.
   The inspector general has offered three proposals to strengthen
the system, but all three have languished in the Legislature.
Dukakis supports two of them _ bills affecting state purchases of
equipment and supplies and similar puchases by local governments _
but has given mixed signals on the measure affecting the hiring of
consultants.
   The administration and state commissions have relied heavily on
consultants to do work ranging from changing lightbulbs to helping
orchestrate the multi-billion dollar harbor cleanup, a practice
which has prompted criticism from Baressi and a wide array of
legislators.
   ``A work force of their own,'' is how state Auditor A. Joseph
DeNucci described the burgeoning corps of consultants.
   The state in fiscal 1987 spent more than $400 million on private
consultants and another $800 million to contract services for human
services programs Another $477 million was spent on private
consultants in fiscal 1988, which ended June 30.
   ``There are times when we have had sharp disagreements with the
inspector general,'' said James Dorsey, the governor's chief
spokesman. ``Not about attacking the problem of fraud, waste and
abuse but how best to do it.''
   Chief among those disagreements is the use of consultants.
   ``We find there is a strong argument to make that putting
engineers and scientists and others on the full time state payroll
rather than hiring them as consultants for temporary duty is a
greater waste,'' Dorsey said last week.
   The administration adopted new guidelines that have stricter
limits on the scope and length of work that can be performed by
consultants, but Cotton said they are too vague.
   ``You could drive a freight train through all the loopholes,''
he said.

   Although the game plan calls for Republicans
to dominate news media attention during the party's national
convention week, a Democrat is giving the GOP a run for its money
in garnering the most interviews.
   By the end of the pre-convention week, Mayor Sidney J.
Barthelemy had given at least 75 planned interviews, plus numerous
impromptu chats, according to his press secretary who said she
hadn't had time to make an exact count.
   ``We always don't get the good press,'' Barthelemy said. ``So I
think this is an opportunity to tell the good things, show the
media that this is a city where you can have a good time and do
business and this is a city that takes care of business.
   ``I hope people will leave here and will have a positive view of
the city if they already didn't have one,'' he said. ``I hope that
some of the people in business will leave here with the idea of
returning and perhaps opening a business.''
   That's the message Barthelemy has been spreading to anyone who
wants to listen _ and there have been plenty of reporters lining up
for interviews.
   ``He loves doing them,'' said Jinx Broussard, the mayor's press
secretary. ``He thinks this is the chance to show off the city and
the fact that we're not just the big easy ... we're on the road to
recovery from the oil and gas collapse and a good place to raise a
family.''
   He's talked with the national news media, has been a hot item
with the scores of newspapers in New Orleans for the convention,
has been interviewed by two London newspapers and plans a lengthy
session with foreign journalists during the next week, Ms.
Broussard said.
   Barthelemy's role is that of a good-will ambassador since, after
all, this is a Republican convention.
   ``I would have been an active player in the (Democratic)
convention,'' he said. ``Now, I'm just an active player in hosting
the convention.''
   Barthelemy, who was elected vice chair in charge of voter
registration at last month's Democratic National Convention in
Atlanta, said he's not bothered by the fact the Republicans did not
invite him to issue an official greeting on the convention's
opening night.
   ``Naturally, I would have been glad to do it,'' he said. ``But
it's their convention.''
   Amid the GOP hoopla, the mayor admits the 1992 Democratic
convention is in the back of his mind. During the Atlanta meeting,
his officials spread the message: ``We would like to have you guys
in `92,'' Barthelemy said.

<HEAD>Iraq Calls for Syria's Expulsion From Arab League</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Iraq-Hussein, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq on Saturday urged Arab states to expel
Syria from the Arab League, citing Syrian policy in Lebanon, its
attacks on Palestinian camps in Beirut and its alliance with Iraq's
arch-enemy, Iran.
   First Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan said Arab
nations should cut off all financial aid to Syria and end dealings
with President Hafez Assad.
   ``The minimum Arab leaders could do is expel the traitor Assad
from their fold and to boycott him,'' Ramadan, also a member of the
Revolutionary Command Council, wrote in an article in the governing
Baath Party paper Al-Thawra.
   ``To maintain contacts with (Assad), whether directly or
indirectly, means they are encouraging him and taking part in his
crimes,'' Ramadan said.
   A proposal to expel Syria would have to be considered during an
Arab League summit meeting. It is unlikely Iraq would prevail if
such a proposal came to a vote. The next meeting has not been
scheduled.
   Ramadan's article contained Iraq's strongest attack in recent
memory on the Syrian leader. It came several days after Iraq and
Iran accepted a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire to start Aug. 20 in their
8-year-old war.
   Syria has been a staunch supporter of Persian Iran against Arab
Iraq in the war, which started in September 1980. Attempts to
reconcile Baghdad and Damascus in the past seven years have failed
due to deep mistrust between the two countries.
   Syria sent 40,000 troops into Lebanon and west Beirut to control
fighting between rival militias.
   All major Arab countries belong to the 21-member Arab League
with the exception of Egypt, whose membership was suspended after
it signed the Camp David accord with Israel.
   In a 1978 summit in Baghdad, the league pledged $1.8 billion in
aid to Syria as a ``confrontation state'' bordering Israel.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With all the restraint of an elephant doing
the full-tilt boogie, the party town and the Grand Old Party are
celebrating this week what they have in common.
   Party. More than 500 separate bashes are scheduled for
convention week, enough to send George Bush into the presidential
fray on a tidal wave of Hurricane rum punch. The Republicans plan
some business, for sure. But, after all, this is New Orleans.
   ``New Orleans will use anything for an excuse for a party. No
matter what happens, there's a party,'' said Doris Finney, a
celebrant Friday night at, well, a party. ``Bring on the
Republicans. New Orleans will party all week.''
   Finney was taking in one of the more staid events, by local
standards, a family affair at City Park featuring fireworks, gospel
music and tunes from ``The Enforcers,'' a band of sheriff's
deputies rocking out in full uniform.
   Jambalaya went for a buck a bowl, and Mayor Sidney Barthelemy
dished out some New Orleans understatement: ``We've showed
everybody,'' he announced, ``that we could put on the greatest
event in the history of this country.''
   Hyperbole may be the hallmark of good times here. ``It's
wonderful. I am 200 percent Republican,'' said Alice Mongeau,
watching the colored shells burst over the park. And her city?
``Sure, it's Republican too,'' she said.
   Not quite. Democrats outnumber Republicans by better than
5-to-1, and Barthelemy liked Jesse Jackson, not exactly a George
Bush soulmate. But in the Crescent City, ideology is not about to
stand in the way of a good time.
   ``We're talking about hospitality,'' said Sheriff Charles Foti,
host of the City Park party. Unusual for a sheriff to throw a
party? ``Sure it's unusual,'' he said, chewing on an unlit cigar.
``This is an unusual town.''
   In some sections it's a downright kinky town. In the bawdy
French Quarter, where strip joints vie with jazz joints, merchants
were waiting anxiously to see if political conservatives like to
loosen up. Early results were mixed.
   ``There's a lot of people out here, but they ain't going in
anywhere,'' bemoaned Manny Moreland, the doorman at Papa Joe's, a
club on Bourbon Street where female impersonators dance nearly
naked. ``Maybe they're afraid to.''
   Not all were timid. ``We had a few delegates come in; they had
their badges on,'' allowed Moreland. ``From New York. Good
tippers.''
   It was a similar story across the street at the Unisex club,
where actual women do the writhing but the early crowd _ that is,
pre-1 a.m. _ was a tad thin. ``They're just walking the street
right now,'' said doorman Barry Whatley. ``But we'll catch 'em
later _ after they've had a few Hurricanes.''
   Bill Ahle, manager of Pat O'Brien's, the home of the Hurricane,
was all for that. ``We ordered extra stock to get us through the
week,'' he said. The stock is equal measures of cocktail punch and
rum. The effect is powerful.
   But getting hammered and looking at strippers is not the only
game in town. There are riverboat cruises and jazz brunches,
fund-raiser receptions and state delegation dinners. Six groups
have rented out the stately Museum of Art for private affairs this
week, including a masked ball.
   The convention master schedule lists everything from a Platform
Committee reception on page one to an open house with the Women's
Opera Guild Association on page 48. In between, comedian Rich
Little will entertain the Conservative Victory Committee ball, the
heads of 30 Fortune 500 companies will do brunch and a 500-member
choir will let loose at a prayer breakfast.
   In their spare time, the Republicans will nominate their
candidate. And on Bourbon Street, the hawkers will keep on hoping.
   ``It's a working convention for these people, I know that,''
said Helen Cavanaugh, a waitress at the French Casino strip joint.
``But maybe after it's over some of 'em will stay around and have
fun.''

<TEXT>
   Radical students battled police with
firebombs and rocks and beat riot troopers with iron bars Saturday
as protesters vowed to reach the North Korean border for
unification talks.
   Hundreds of students caught police by surprise when they charged
out of Yonsei University to attack troops encircling the campus to
try and stop radicals assembling for a march Monday to the border.
   Troopers were sleeping or resting when students charged them,
hurling firebombs and lashing out with iron bars and clubs. At
least three troopers were knocked senseless and dozens of others
injured as they tried to fend off blows with shields or fled.
   ``Advance national reunification!'' and ``Yankees go home!'' the
protesters chanted.
   Police were forced back by the rampaging students until hundreds
of reinforcments were rushed up from nearby sidestreets to drive
the howling protesters back with volleys of tear gas.
   National Police Headquarters in Seoul said many officers and
protesters were injured, but no figures were available. Police said
dozens of students were arrested.
   About 200 students demonstrating at Myongdong Roman Catholic
Cathedral in the center of Seoul earlier tried to break through
surrounding police lines with firebombs but were driven back.
   More than 3,000 riot police surrounded Yonsei in western Seoul
to block the march to the border truce site of Panmunjom for talks
with communist North Korean student delegates on reunification. The
government banned the march and police are on top alert to block it.
   Meanwhile, a group of North Korean students who hope to
participate in the talks arrived on Saturday at Kaesong, a border
town near Panmunjom, the North Korean Central News Agency said in a
report monitored in Tokyo.
   It said the students marched from the northern part of the
peninsula to Pyongyang, where they boarded buses to continue their
trip toward Panmunjom.
   The report didn't say how many students were involved.
   In South Korea, about 4,000 students, many from other cities,
managed to get past the police cordon around Yonsei University. But
dozens of students were halted and taken away by police who
questioned and searched people approaching the school. Police
officers beat and kicked some detained students.
   Student leaders said they would go ahead with the march despite
the massive police deployment. ``We will never, never give in,''
said one.
   Kim Yong-kap, minister of government administration, said the
students were becoming a threat to stability and the administration
might have to take drastic measures to suppress violent protests.
   President Roh Tae-woo said Friday that violent protests were a
threat to the Olympics, to be held in Seoul Sept. 17-Oct. 2, and
said the government would not tolerate continued unrest.
   Student protests over the past week in support of Monday's march
have been relatively small with just a few thousand people taking
part.
   The students want to meet with North Korean student delegates at
Panmunjom for talks on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula. They
also demand removal of the 42,000 U.S. troops in South Korea under
a treaty and contend Washington backs military rule in the country.
   Most South Koreans oppose the talks, and riot police blocked a
similar march in June. Turnout for the rallies for the latest march
has been lower than in June.
   Several hundred shopkeepers and residents staged demonstrations
in Seoul to demand students stop violent protests. Residents living
around Yonsei demanded students abandon the march.
   ``This is terrible. People are against this,'' a middle-aged
businessmen complained as he watched students fighting police.
   Radical students seized on the reunification issue to try and
mobilize public support for their anti-government campaign. The
students, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have failed to
gain support because of violent tactics and open advances to the
totalitarian north.
   The peninsula has been divided since 1945 at the end of World
War II. North Korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean
War.

   Georgia Republican Chairman John M. Stuckey Jr.
has decided he won't resign to protest losing a battle for control
of the state's delegation to the GOP National Convention, a party
official said.
   A group including party dissidents and supporters of television
evangelist Pat Robertson won a majority of seats in the 48-member
delegation in a decision by the Republican National Committee.
   Stuckey, who had been in New Orleans to plead his case, left the
convention city to return home and contemplate his future.
   ``He has definitely decided not to resign as chairman,'' state
GOP Executive Director Lee Raudonis said Friday. ``He has decided
to stay on and get on with the job of electing Republicans.''

   Elmo R. Zumwalt III, son of the
admiral who ordered the spraying of Agent Orange in Vietnam and who
was exposed to the defoliant himself, died at his home Saturday
from cancer. He was 42.
   Zumwalt, a lawyer, said he never blamed his father for his
disease. The two co-wrote a book titled ``My Father, My Son,''
which was made into a television movie.
   Zumwalt was diagnosed in January 1983 as having stage 4
non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In February 1985, during his ninth biopsy,
doctors discovered he had stage 3 Hodgkins disease, another form of
lymphoma.
   Agent Orange contains highly toxic dioxin. Veterans had
contended that exposure to it causes cancer and other illnesses.
They said it caused miscarriages by wives of servicemen and birth
defects in their children.
   Zumwalt's son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV, suffers from a
congenital dysfunction that confuses his physical senses.
   In an article published in the Washington Post on Oct. 7, 1984,
Zumwalt said: ``My father, Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Jr., was a strong
advocate of the use of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War. That
doesn't mean that I hold him responsible for any disease I may have
incurred. He did what he felt he had to do to reduce casualties. I
did what I felt I had to do. I volunteered for service in Vietnam
because I felt whatever the risks, that was where I belonged. Even
now at the age of 38 I'm confronted by undoubted perils. I am not
sorry I went.''
   On June 30, the U.S. Supreme Court removed the last legal
obstacle to a $180 million settlement between Vietnam veterans and
the manufacturers of Agent Orange. The justices let stand rulings
that dismissed lawsuits by about 300 veterans who had challenged
the 1984 settlement.
   The $180 million settlement now totals about $240 million with
interest. As many as 250,000 people could receive money from the
settlement.
   The elder Zumwalt said he ordered Agent Orange sprayed over the
Mekong Delta to kill vegetation and drive ``the Viet Cong back
1,000 yards off the water's edge.''
   He commanded Naval forces in Vietnam from 1968-1970, then served
as chief of Naval operations until 1974 when he retired from active
duty. His son served in Vietnam from June 1969 to August 1970 as a
lieutenant junior grade commanding a patrol boat.
   ``I do not have any guilt feelings because I was convinced then
and I am convinced now that the use of Agent Orange saved literally
hundreds and maybe thousands of lives,'' the elder Zumwalt told The
Associated Press in 1985.
   In addition to his son, Zumwalt is survived by his wife,
Katherine; and his daughter, Maya, 13.

<HEAD>Armenians Wait Near Embassy for Chance to Emigrate</HEAD>

   For the past several weeks, crowds of Armenians
have gathered outside the U.S. Embassy, hoping for word they can
come to America. At night they sleep at friends' homes, railroad
stations or wherever they can find room.
   The embassy stopped processing their applications for refugee
status July 1 because the U.S. State Department ran out of money
for the program.
   Beginning this week, embassy officials expect to start the
process again under a new program that requires refugees and their
families in the United States to pay a bigger share of resettlement
expenses.
   But it will take U.S. consular officials weeks to catch up with
the backlog of 3,000 people who already had been told to report for
pre-departure interviews when the money ran out _ and 1,600 people
who have applied since.
   Abel Kasoyan's journey to Los Angeles to be reunited with his
sister is one of those that stalled in Moscow.
   The 30-year-old Kasoyan, his father, mother, wife and two
children aged 3 and 5 arrived in the capital July 1 from Armenia, a
Soviet republic bordering Turkey and Iran.
   He carried a slip of paper from the U.S. Embassy that told him
to report July 19 for an interview and then a quick departure.
   He still has not been interviewed.
   The family, which sold its belongings, has had to scramble for
food and lodging. ``We lived in the Kursk railroad station (in
Moscow) almost a week,'' he said in an interview last week across
the street from the embassy.
   Others who joined him said they didn't understand how the U.S.
government could run out of money. But they said they still wanted
to go to America.
   ``People have been waiting for years, and now it's impossible
for financial reasons,'' said 54-year-old Gratich Froundjian of
Yerevan, the Armenian capital. ``If it's possible to find millions
of dollars for the Contras in Nicaragua, they can find money for
us, too.''
   The U.S. refugee resettlement program ran out of money because
of a sharp increase in the number of people the Soviet Union is
allowing to emigrate.
   The embassy in June gave permission to a record 2,063 Soviets to
immigrate, more than in all of fiscal year 1987. About 94 percent
of that total were Armenians, U.S. officials say.
   ``We recognize the difficulty they're in and we're trying to be
helpful,'' a diplomat said.
   The embassy tried to contact people to warn them not to come to
Moscow because of the budgetary problems, he said.
   ``We'll move these people just as fast as we can,'' he said. ``I
don't think anybody will be going out next week, but we'll start
interviewing people next week.''
   Several U.S. senators and congressmen criticized the original
suspension of the program until the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1
as a ``terrible signal to those seeking freedom all over the
world.''
   Under the new rules, relatives in the United States must file an
affidavit of financial support or guarantee of employment, and the
immigrants or their relatives must pay for transportation after a
U.S.-sponsored flight to Rome.
   Some Armenians are worried that the additional requirements may
delay their resettlement.
   ``Our relatives have to accept us and support us,'' said Gagam
Petrossyan, 48, of Yerevan, who wants to join his brother in Los
Angeles. ``My relatives still aren't in a position to support me.''

<HEAD>Vietnam Stress Illness More Common Than Federal Estimate, Study
Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One in seven Vietnam veterans suffers from
post-traumatic stress disorder, a rate seven times that estimated
by a government study earlier this year, a researcher reported
Saturday.
   The 15 percent rate cited in the latest study translates to
about 470,000 cases.
   The discrepancy with the 2.2 percent rate reported earlier by
the federal Centers for Disease Control arises mostly from
differences in the criteria for diagnosis.
   In contrast to a single yardstick used in the CDC study, the new
estimate relied on several measures, said researcher William
Schlenger.
   ``To me the compelling reason for believing we're right is we
have these multiple measures,'' said Schlenger, of the Research
Triangle Institute in Research Triangle Park, N.C.
   He described the study at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association and in interviews.
   Post-traumatic stress disorder can appear months or years after
a traumatic experience such as combat, natural disaster or airplane
crash.
   Symptoms include sudden, vivid reliving of the experience,
nightmares that can make a person awaken screaming, and intense
distress from events that symbolize or resemble the trauma. Some
victims remain on constant alert for danger.
   The new estimate says the disorder afflicts 15 percent of male
Vietnam veterans and 9 percent of female Vietnam veterans. The
number of females was small enough that the overall rate is still
15 percent, Schlenger said.
   The estimate was developed by researchers at Schlenger's
institute, a private not-for-profit research firm; San Diego State
University, and the University of California at San Francisco.
   The ``National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study'' included
long interviews with about 1,600 veterans who served in Vietnam,
Laos or Cambodia or the surrounding waters or airspace.
   For comparison purposes, researchers also interviewed veterans
who served elsewhere during the Vietnam era, and a group of
civilians of similar age, sex, racial and ethnic makeup.
   The total number of interviews for all three groups was 3,016.
The comparison groups showed much lower rates of stress disorder
than the Vietnam veterans, but their estimates have not been
released, Schlenger said.
   The 15 percent rate, combined with the finding that 38.7 percent
of Vietnam veterans were exposed to definite trauma such as combat
or exposure to dead or dying people, suggests that about a third of
veterans who were exposed to such trauma in Vietnam now suffer from
the disorder, Schlenger said.
   That underlines the long-term nature of the problem, he said.
   The difference with the earlier CDC estimate for Vietnam
veterans stems from differences in definition, such as how recently
a person has experienced symptoms. The CDC study asked about
symptoms experienced in the month before the interview, while the
new study went back six months.
   Researchers in the new study said the six-month period is better
suited to the waxing and waning of symptoms.
   The new study also used five diagnostic measures, of which three
had to agree on the diagnosis before it was officially assigned,
Schlenger said. In 87 percent of cases at least four measures
agreed on the diagnosis, he said.
   Robin Morris, a Georgia State University associate professor of
psychology and consultant to the CDC for its study, said the
measures in the new study were unavailable when the CDC began its
project.
   The overall difference between the two estimates boils down to
``where do you make the cut (in) how severe the problems are before
you call it a case,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``We detected what would be severe cases,'' said Frank DeStefano
of CDC, a co-author of the earlier study. The new study used what
``would probably be more liberal criteria, in which less severe
cases would probably be included as well,'' he said.
   Schlenger agreed that the CDC study probably found the most
severe cases and said it overlooked some less severe ones that
still could benefit from treatment.
   CDC consultant Morris said he did not ``really have any trouble
with their findings. Both results clearly say there's a problem.
That's the issue for me.''

<HEAD>$3.5 Million Lotto Winner Files For Protection From Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Holland said when he won a $3.5
million Lotto jackpot two years ago in the Washington State Lottery
that he did not want to spend his money foolishly.
   Holland and his wife Patricia filed for protection and
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law Friday, owing
$450,000 to nine creditors who obtained court orders giving them
rights to his next annual lottery payment.
   ``He was a pauper before he won the Lotto, kind of a starving
construction worker,'' said his former wife, Karen Klingler.
   They divorced before he won the sweepstakes. Now she's a
creditor, and has obtained a garnishment for more than $15,000 in
support payments for their 11-year-old daughter, court records show.
   Holland's third annual payment of $140,000, after a deduction
for federal taxes, is due Thursday.
   With Friday's filing, federal Bankruptcy Judge Frank Howard
signed an order that the next payment go into a trust account for
the time being, said Holland's attorney, Neil Shillito.
   The judge allowed the couple to take $3,500 for living expenses
and administrative costs of the case, but other payments require a
court order, Shillito said.
   ``Once the dust settles in a couple weeks, we'll be in a better
position to know how to go about taking care of the valid claims
against the estate,'' Shillito said.
   Holland, 34, and Shillito have refused to discuss his business
dealings or say how his rags-to-riches story turned back to rags.
   When he won the Lotto in August 1986, Holland told a reporter he
was a building contractor. He said he bought the van of his dreams
and was looking for a fancy present for his daughter but wanted to
avoid squandering his new-found wealth and planned to hire a
financial adviser.
   His ex-wife says he also bought a car, a truck, furniture, TV
satellite dish and a house, and started a dry-cleaning business,
Holland Cleaners Inc.
   The business folded late last year, said Grant B. Anderson, a
former lawyer for the operation. In January, Holland Cleaners
employees who had been working without pay for a month picketed the
business, but a company spokesman said money to pay them had been
frozen since another dry-cleaning company purchased the business in
December.
   The dry-cleaning problem alone ``is a mess,'' Anderson said.
``It's an unfortunate situation.''
   Creditors include two banks claiming about $197,000 for three
loans, including one for the purchase of another dry-cleaning
business, T.L.C. of Tacoma.
   Holland and his wife also owe more than $154,000 in medical
bills, much of it for the birth of their daughter, Michele, on
April 27, 1987, court records show.
   If the creditors do not receive all they're due from the next
lottery payment, they probably will garnish future checks, said Jim
Lancaster, an attorney for Oregon First Bank, which is owed more
than $170,000.

<TEXT>
   Police fired birdshot Saturday as they
rounded up suspects in a working-class suburb where Moslem
extremists clashed with security forces outside a mosque, witnesses
said.
   One civilian was killed and several wounded during the roundup
in the Ein Shams district of northeastern Cairo, the witnesses and
hospital officials said. The state-owned Middle East News Agency
said one died and 23 were hurt.
   Authorities were looking for residents who participated in a
clash Friday night between Moslem extremists and police. The
extremists swung chains and threw stones at the police, who fought
back with tear gas and sticks.
   Three policemen and 16 civilians were wounded in the battle in
Ein Shams, said a senior police official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said more than 120 extremists also hurled flaming objects at
police and set a police van ablaze. The official said more than 70
extremists were arrested during the clash Friday night.
   During the roundup Saturday, police fired birdshot to intimidate
people on the streets and entered houses to make arrests, witnesses
said. The news agency said 27 people were arrested.
   Sources at a nearby hospital, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said one person died and several were wounded during the
roundup. They declined to identify those hurt or describe the
extent of their injuries.
   The police official said Friday's half-hour clash began after
police went to the Adam Mosque in Ein Shams and waited outside to
detain a number of extremist suspects who were meeting inside after
evening prayers.
   ``The clash began after policemen moved to make arrests as the
extremists were leaving the mosque,'' the official said.
   The Middle East News Agency said the extremists belonged to the
underground fundamentalist organization Jihad, a local group which
has no connection with Lebanon's Islamic Jihad. Jihad means ``holy
war'' in Arabic.
   The agency said the extremists were planning ``provocations and
acts of violence,'' including incitement of Moslem-Christian strife
and distribution of anti-government leaflets.
   The government says members of Egypt's Jihad killed President
Anwar Sadat at a military parade on Oct. 6, 1981 and later led a
two-day uprising in the southern city of Assiut in which more than
80 people, mostly policemen, were killed. The government believes
the extremists hoped the uprising would trigger a revolution
overthrowing the government.
   In the Sadat assassination and coup attempt trials that
followed, five people were sentenced to death and executed, three
by firing squad and two by hanging. More than 120 were given prison
terms of up to 25 years.

   Here, at a glance, is a look at Burma:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Burma is about the size of Texas and shares frontiers
with India, China, Thailand and Laos. Resources include fertile
soil, timber, oil and other minerals. Rangoon, with a population of
3.5 million, is the capital and largest city. Mandalay, in the
heart of the country, is the second-largest city and the center of
traditional culture.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Most of the 38 million people are Burmans.
Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins
and Kachins. About 85 percent of the people practice Buddhism, with
minorities adhering to Islam and Christianity.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Per capita income is less than $200 a year, making
Burma one of the world's poorest nations. It once was the world's
leading rice exporter, but it experienced food shortages in 1987.
Burma's debt has climbed to more than $3 billion.
   The black market, fueled by smuggled goods from Thailand and
China, overshadows the official economy.
   Burma's economic failure is generally attributed to poor
government management and a crippling war against several ethnic
minorities seeking autonomy. Japan and West Germany are major aid
donors, and the United States has a modest assistance program,
mainly in the anti-drug area.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Burma's golden age was the 12th century, when its
kings built the spectacular temples of Pagan. Britain ruled it from
1886 to 1948. After a post-independence experiment with democracy,
a military coup in 1962 brought Gen. Ne Win to power. He imposed
isolationism, military control and socialist economics.
   Ne Win remained as leader until his resignation July 23
following anti-government demonstrations. He was replaced by
retired army general Sein Lwin, who resigned today after nationwide
anti-government riots.
   Burma seeks to maintain a strictly neutralist policy and keep
out most foreign influences, including joint ventures with foreign
companies. It has been nicknamed ``Asia's hermit.'' Tourists are
allowed to stay only one week.

   Massachusetts Republicans have produced a
video attacking Michael Dukakis and plan to distribute it to other
states' delegations at the Republican National Convention to ``get
the truth out'' about the Democratic nominee.
   The 10-minute video, which will be unveiled Tuesday by
Republican National Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. and state GOP
Chairman Ray Shamie, shows ``the truth rather than the myth that
Dukakis likes to perpetuate,'' Shamie said.
   ``He talks about things, puts a nice spin on them, but the facts
are quite different. What we're doing is debunking many of his
statements,'' Shamie said in a pre-convention telephone interview.
   Joseph Malone, the Republican Senate candidate trying to unseat
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said other states' GOP chairmen
will get copies and ``each chairman will use it to get the truth
out about Mike Dukakis.''
   ``It will point out what Mike Dukakis said in his speech about
protecting the environment, then point to the fact that
Massachusetts has the most polluted harbor in the nation in the
Boston Harbor and the governor ignored that fact as the harbor
became more and more polluted,'' Malone said.
   ``It will point out his statements on balancing the budget and
then point to the recent budget crisis in Massachusetts,'' he said.
   ``We're very familiar with the miracle,'' Shamie said, a
deriding reference to the state's economic rebound that Dukakis
takes partial credit for on the presidential campaign trail.

<TEXT>
   Burma's ``wasted generation'' of
students, who braved bayonets and armored cars to force the
resignation of a harsh leader, may take to the streets again unless
their demands for democracy and ecomomic reforms are met.
   President Sein Lwin, who stepped down Friday after 17 days in
power, was a strong magnet for the students' anger and passionate
demands for a multi-party system, release of political prisoners
and changes in the shattered economy.
   ``They are the storm troopers, the spearhead, those who took the
initiative in organizing the demonstrations,'' said Bertil Lintner,
a Swedish journalist and scholar specializing in Burma.
   The 200,000 university students and about 1.3 million high
school students belong to what some Burmese have called ``a wasted
generation.''
   Thousands of university graduates unable to find jobs in the
troubled economy drive taxis, sell trinkets in the marketplace or
serve as night guards. Many have left the isolationist country,
where pre-World War II medical books are still used and the
Reader's Digest was once banned.
   On Saturday, a day after Sein Lwin's resignation, the students
continued to distribute leaflets urging protests for democracy.
   The young people, dozens of whom were killed this year in
anti-government protests, appeared to have served as catalysts for
Sein Lwin's fall. But they stopped short of storming the seat of
power or proposing a leader to succeed Sein Lwin.
   American Burma expert Josef Silverstein said in an interview he
believes the students are not well organized and do not have strong
leaders, and it appears professional military officers would have
to step in to direct political events after Sein Lwin's resignation.
   ``Students can make revolution, but not what comes after,'' said
Silverstein, the author of several books on Burma.
   The state media announced Friday that the governing Burma
Socialist Program Party _ the country's only political party for a
quarter century _ would meet this week, presumably to choose a new
leader from the ranks of the military or the present government.
   Diplomats and other analysts say the most violent students may
grant a more liberal new leader a ``honeymoon'' period before
resuming protests that reflect their deep aversion to the existing
political system.
   But Lintner said the students, who in March virtually
singlehandedly fought the brutal security forces led by Sein Lwin,
were joined in last week's protests by citizens representing a wide
spectrum of Burmese society, from Buddhist monks to workers.
   ``It looks like Asian-style chaos but they have a system and it
works,'' he said in an interview, describing student organization
as necessarily ``elastic and fluid, based on trust and secrecy'' to
prevent infiltraton by security services.
   In the current issue of the Hong Kong newsmagazine Far Eastern
Economic Review, Lintner said the students in the past few months
have assembled a loose umbrella group known as the All-Burma
Students Democratic Association, with 20 to 30 leaders at its core.
   He said the group includes an information department, an
intelligence unit and a social welfare department to distribute
food, water and money to demonstrators. The students, who executed
three suspected informants, seized weapons by killing soldiers on
night patrol, he said.
   Their main weapons, Lintner said, are knives and homemade
spears, or ``jinglee,'' tainted with excrement or poison. One
foreign journalist said the students' inexperience in street
fighting was evident when a group of protestors appeared uncertain
how to burn a vehicle.
   Robert Taylor, a London-based Burma scholar and author, said
Rangoon's leaders were ``hoisted by their own ideology.'' Students
for years have studied books written by their elders, who in their
own student days fought the British and the Japanese in Burma.
   Burmese students entered the political scene in 1920, when they
held a strike to protest university regulations imposed by the
British. They remained at the forefront of anti-colonial agitation
and played a prominent role during Burma's chaotic post-war
experiment in democracy.
   The heady days came to a quick end after the military coup by
former leader Ne Win in 1962. Shortly after Ne Win came to power,
Sein Lwin crushed a student protest at Rangoon University and
ordered troops to blow up the university's student union building,
a symbol of student activism.
   Since then, students staged about a dozen massive protests, and
the government responded each time by temporarily closing schools,
jailing protestors and attempting to infiltrate student groups.
   In 1974, the students fought authorities, whom they accused of
giving the late Burmese U.N. Secretary-General U Thant a burial
inappropriate to his respected position.
   In March this year, demonstrating students were attacked by Sein
Lwin's riot police, and the government said more than 43 people
were killed. Last week, they led the largest anti-government
protests since Burma's colonial times, and the government said at
least 95 people were killed.

   Spurning medical advice that he was
risking his life, United Farm Workers' union leader Cesar Chavez
continued his fast into its 28th day Saturday, but grape growers
say his effort has attracted more publicity than actual support for
the union's 4-year-old boycott.
   The image of a frail Chavez shuffling into the union meeting
hall to attend Mass has spurred unions from all over the country to
send telegrams in support of his open-ended fast.
   Hollywood stars and children of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy
came to this rural community 150 miles north of Los Angeles and
made dramatic endorsements of the boycott, and the president-elect
of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, issued a statement on behalf
of Chavez, 61.
   What remains to be seen is if publicity raised by the longest
fast of Chavez's life will inspire consumers to stay away from
California table grapes. He conducted a 25-day fast in 1968 and a
24-day fast in 1972.
   Two decades ago, Chavez had his first major success with another
grape boycott. The highly publicized, five-year boycott ended when
Delano-area growers agreed to a contract with the union in July
1970.
   But the UFW no longer has any contracts with California table
grape growers, and its dues-paying membership has been halved since
1978, to about 30,000.
   During the current boycott, one California supermarket chain,
Save Mart, has obtained court orders to stop picketing outside its
stores. Officials of other California grocery stores and
restaurants report little consumer action on behalf of the boycott.
   ``I'm not aware of any impact directly related to the food
service industry,'' said Stanley Kyker, executive vice president of
the 9,000-member California Restaurant Association.
   ``The boycott, as far as I'm concerned, has been nothing,'' said
Charles Collings, president of Raley's Supermarkets and chairman of
the California Grocers Association.
   The union isn't providing a tally of stores cooperating with the
boycott because store managers fear retribution from growers for
supporting the union, said UFW spokeswoman Lorena Parlee.
   Since beginning his water-only diet July 17, Chavez has lost at
least 26 pounds and barely has the stamina to sit through a
two-hour nightly community meeting and Mass. He suffers bouts of
nausea and dizziness, and he nearly fell Wednesday after standing
for a prayer.
   But despite those problems and a risk of kidney failure, he
refuses his doctor's request to end the fast and enter the
hospital. Chavez's mental condition reportedly remains sharp as he
spends his time largely in bed, reading works of Martin Luther King
Jr., St. Francis of Assisi and Gandhi.
   The boycott has two goals: to halt the use of five pesticides
and protest the state's Agricultural Labor Relations Board, which
oversees farm labor elections. The union claims the agency has
become a tool of the Republican administration of Gov. George
Deukmejian.
   Growers charge that Chavez, who has not talked to reporters
during his fast, has inflated dangers about the five pesticides in
an attempt to bolster a weakened union.
   ``If he were really worried about consumers' health and the farm
workers' health, then he would be saying `ban chemicals from all
products,''' said Bruce Obbink, president of the California Table
Grape Commission.
   Dr. Marion Moses, a union consultant, said the UFW chose to
boycott table grapes as a starting point to raise public
consciousness on the problems of pesticides. The union says grape
pickers suffer the highest rate of pesticide poisonings in
agriculture, and grapes are among the most heavily sprayed crops.
   Jim Wells, a pesticide expert with the California Food and
Agriculture Department, said that ``if you consider all the
occupational illnesses, grape workers get a large portion of
them.'' He explained that grape pickers frequently get rashes from
sulphur spray and also from the intense heat in Central California
fields.

   Comparing the Republican and Democratic party
platforms is like comparing the ride in a Learjet with travel on a
crowded 747: Both will get you there, but, my, are the experiences
different.
   The Republican platform is heavy with specifics _ from the
heifer tax to protecting ``the Pledge of Allegiance in all
schools.''
   The Democratic document is much slimmer and sticks to themes _
from ``the American dream of opportunity'' to ``good jobs at good
wages.''
   The Democratic platform is about 5,000 words; the GOP document
more than 30,000.
   ``What we have done is be overly specific. If there is any
complaint you can make, it is going to be tough for someone to read
the whole thing. But we're not planning on people doing that,''
said Sen. Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, a Republican Platform
Committee co-chairman. ``We were rushing in order to emphasize the
vagueness in the Democratic platform by becoming specific in ours.''
   The Republicans bash Michael Dukakis over and over again _
without ever mentioning his name, calling him only ``the Democratic
presidential nominee.'' The Democrats never mentioned George Bush
or Ronald Reagan _ and included the word ``Republican'' only once.
   Party platforms are not crucial documents that shape the course
of the presidential campaign. Few people outside the party faithful
even read the rhetoric. And presidents don't usually feel bound by
platform promises when they take office.
   But this year, the platforms do provide a reading on what the
candidates want to tell the voters.
   And this year, each document is undoubtedly what each party's
nominee wanted. While the candidates had to make some concessions _
Bush to the hard-line conservatives and Dukakis to Jesse Jackson _
those adjustments were really at the margins.
   ``The vice president is comfortable with this platform,''
declared aide Charlie Black on Friday as the GOP platform committee
wrapped up its work.
   Committee chairman Kay Orr, the Nebraska governor, said Bush
called her Saturday morning to say he was proud of the document.
   The GOP planks are resolutely conservative, strongly
anti-communist and anti-abortion with a leavening of stances on
such non-traditional issues as day care.
   The Democrats' is a mix of liberal touchstones such as a
``full-employment economy,'' the Equal Rights Amendment and
abortion availabilty, accompanied by conservative-sounding
declarations such as ``a strong commitment to fiscal
responsibility.''
   The Star Wars missile defense system, aid to the Contras and
opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state highlight a GOP
foreign policy plank that boasts of Reagan administration successes
and promises more of the same.
   The Democratic document says, ``We will cease dealing with drug
smugglers and seek to reconcile our differences with countries in
Central America.'' It also talks of ``clearheaded, tough-minded,
decisive American foreign policy'' and ``a role of responsible
active international leadership.''
   The Republicans were quick to say that they had covered all the
major issues, while accusing the Democrats of ``ducking 125 major
issues'' ranging from tax increases to pornography.
   The Democrats accused their opponents of retreading the 1980 and
1984 platforms, ``talking about the future through a rear-view
mirror.''
   Rhetoric aside, both platforms duck difficult issues. The
Republicans talk about Bush's flexible budget freeze without
explaining how promised new programs _ and ``rapid and certain
deployment'' of the Strategic Defense Initiative _ could be paid
for.
   The Democrats talk about finding the ``resources'' to pay for
government programs without ever mentioning the dreaded ``t'' word
_ taxes.
   Of course, there are many themes that are shared by the
platforms.
   There are commitments to equal rights, a strong economy and a
strong defense, a clean environment and drug-free schools.
   One interesting similarity is that both talk about the need for
change.
   Obviously, the Democrats focused on change because they want to
change control of the White House after eight years in Republican
hands.
   ``We believe it is time for America to change and move forward
again in the interest of all its families,'' says the Democratic
platform, ``to turn away from an era in which too many of America's
children have been homeless or hungry and invest in a new era of
hope and progress, an era of secure families in a secure America in
a secure world.''
   But Bush and the Republicans, seeking to build on the Reagan
legacy, are also talking about change _ no doubt because the polls
say Americans want changes in the nation's direction.
   ``An election is about the future, about change,'' says the GOP
platform preamble. ``Americans want leadership to direct the forces
of change, on America's terms, guided by American values.''
   ``The election will bring change. The question is: Will it be
change and progress with the Republicans or change and chaos with
the Democrats?''
   Change will come to the White House in 1989 no matter who is
elected. And the 1988 party platforms are a decent navigational aid
for figuring out what changes in course may be coming.

<HEAD>House Chairman Praises Drought Relief Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee chairman
praised the nation's $3.9 billion drought-relief program Saturday
and urged Democrats to set the agenda for a major 1990 farm bill.
   ``The aid that will be provided will give farmers hope and at
least a portion of the financial resources they need to try again
next year,'' Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, D-Texas, said in the
Democratic response to President Reagan's weekly radio address.
   The chairman took issue with neither Reagan nor congressional
Republicans but instead strongly praised lawmakers for fashioning a
1985 farm program and related measures that have ``helped the
farmer survive difficult times.''
   ``But we cannot legislate weather, so the devastating drought of
1988 has set us back, at least temporarily,'' de la Garza said. He
praised the relief bill signed Thursday by Reagan as one that would
keep many farmers going, even though ``we simply do not have the
money to cover all losses.''
   The new law will pay farmers who have lost at least 35 percent
of their crop 65 percent of their losses over that amount. It will
pay those who have lost at least 75 percent of their crop 90
percent of their losses over that amount.
   Government livestock feed aid is expanded and streamlined under
the program. The dairy price-support level will be increased by 50
cents for each 100 pounds of milk for three months. In some cases,
farmers who would otherwise have to refund some advance
income-support payments will be allowed to keep the money.
   ``Now that drought relief is in place, the Democrats in Congress
must set an agenda so that, when we write the next farm bill, we
can provide an even better framework within which American farmers
can compete in world trade while keeping Americans the best-fed
people in the world at reasonable prices,'' de la Garza said.
   Congress is expected to pass a new farm program in 1990 with
preliminary debate probably getting under way next year. The
discussion is likely to usher in new demands for controls on crop
production as a way of increasing prices.

   A bull got loose in the stands during the
Omak Stampede rodeo when a gate was left open, sending spectators
hurrying out of the way and slightly injuring four, officials said.
   The bull pushed open a latched gate Friday night, then moved
through a second gate that mistakenly had been left open and went
from the arena into the stands, which were about half-full at the
time, said Johnny Pope, a professional rodeo announcer who was
working the show.
   While spectators moved out of the way, the bull rambled to the
top of the stands, turned left, headed across the length of the
seating area, then turned again and headed down, bumping one woman,
rodeo officials said.
   Pope said the bull brushed past a man who was hanging over the
fence between the stands and the arena, making him fall over the
barrier. The man hit the front end of a parked ambulance.
   The bull was recaptured after it re-entered the arena.
   The bull had a relatively mild reputation among rodeo clowns,
whose job includes distracting animals in the event someone falls
or is otherwise threatened with injury, Pope said.
   Three men and a woman were taken to Mid-Valley Hospital in this
north-central Washington town and all were released soon afterward
suffering mostly bumps and bruises, said night supervisor Cathy
Grimmett.

<HEAD>Lebanese Parliament To Choose New President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament will choose a successor to
President Amin Gemayel this week, House Speaker Hussein Husseini
announced on Saturday.
   Husseini told reporters after a meeting of the Parliament's
six-member secretariat that the 76 Parliament members will hold the
election Thursday.
   The speaker, a Shiite Moslem, did not disclose further details.
   The six-year term of Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic, expires Sept.
23.
   Under the constitution he cannot seek a second consecutive term.
The constitution does not specify a date for the election of a
president, who is chosen by the one-chamber Parliament.
   An unwritten national covenant says Lebanon's head of state must
be a Maronite Catholic, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the
House speaker a Shiite. About 20 Maronite politicians, civil
servants, army officers and businessmen are competing for the post
of president.
   The constitution says the winner must be elected by a two-thirds
majority, or a 51 percent majority in a second round.
   The 99-seat Parliament was elected for a four-year term in 1972.
A civil war that broke out in 1975 has prevented parliamentary
elections and Parliament has been extending its own term.
   Twenty-two deputies have died since 1972. Gemayel's seat became
vacant in 1982 when he was elected president. That left Parliament
with only 76 members.
   The presidential election Thursday will be the eighth since
Lebanon's independence from French rule in 1943, and the 14th since
the state of Lebanon was first created during the French mandate in
1926.
   On Aug. 23, 1982, the current president's younger brother,
Bashir Gemayel, was elected president. He was assassinated in a
bomb explosion on Sept. 14, nine days before he was due to assume
office.
   Some believe violence could disrupt Thursday's election. Last
week, rival Shiite Moslem factions battled in south Beirut. The
clash pitted the mainstream Shiite Amal movement against the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   It was the first violent confrontation between the rival Shiite
factions since Syria deployed 7,500 troops in most of south Beirut
in May to end three weeks of bloody fighting between Amal and
Hezbollah.

<TEXT>
   Michael Dukakis saluted rival George Bush
as a man of ``enormous courage and tremendous patriotism'' Saturday
while continuing his assault on President Reagan's ``irresponsible
fiscal policy.''
   The Democratic nominee, interrupting a weekend on Cape Cod to
meet with reporters, was asked about a World War II gunner's
challenge to Bush's account of being shot down over the Pacific.
The gunner disputed the vice president's claim that the plane was
on fire when he ejected.
   ``I don't think that kind of thing has any place in a
campaign,'' Dukakis said. ``He served this country. He served it
with tremendous courage. You don't fly 58 missions without enormous
courage and tremendous patriotism.''
   Dukakis continued to link the jump in the prime lending rate to
10 percent this past week to the Reagan administration's deficit
spending.
   ``I'm very concerned, and I think all Americans are concerned,
about what's happening to our economy,'' he said. ``This increase
in interest rates is every bit as much a tax as a legislated tax.''
   The Massachusetts governor and his wife, Kitty, were spending
the weekend at the home of Mrs. Dukakis' sister, Ginny Peters, and
her husband, Al.
   Dukakis said he planned to take a swim Saturday and spend most
of the day reading issues papers and material about the presidency.
After tending to state business Monday and Tuesday, he planned to
head back out to the campaign trail during the Republican National
Convention.
   Dukakis and his wife joked about a comment by Bush's wife,
Barbara, that the public affection between the Dukakises was phony.
   ``You're not supposed to touch me; it's against the rules,''
Mrs. Dukakis said as she came out of her sister's home and sat next
to her husband on a deck overlooking the water.
   ``It's a little bit of paradise off the beaten track,'' Dukakis
said of the Peters home. He also led reporters and a few aides in
singing ``Happy Birthday'' to a member of the press corps.
   Dukakis began focusing on economic issues Thursday after major
banks raised their prime lending rate to 10 percent.
   On Friday he called the increase an ``irresponsibility tax''
triggered by Reagan's deficit spending. Saturday, he referred to it
as a ``family tax'' that would drive up mortgage costs and prevent
millions of people from buying homes.
   The deficit and rising interest rates will create ``enormous
inflationary pressure on the economy,'' Dukakis said. ``It will be
the American people who ultimately will pay the bills.... These are
burdens which average American families should not be putting up
with. They are burdens that are the result of irresponsible fiscal
policy.''
   While Dukakis took the weekend off, his campaign launched its
first television ad of the general election campaign.
   The 60-second spot airing in Texas and California touts Dukakis'
economic successes as Massachusetts' governor and features several
shots from his acceptance speech at the Democratic National
Convention.

   President Reagan said Saturday that ``George
Bush and I have been hard at work putting into practice the ideals
you believe in'' while the Democrats only talk.
   In his weekly radio speech, Reagan pledged to campaign actively
for Bush's election as president because of ``my love for America
and my dreams for her future.''
   Bush, he said, ``understands that the question for America today
is not, `What's different?' but `What's next?'''
   The president spoke from the Oval Office. He and first lady
Nancy Reagan fly Sunday to New Orleans, where the president will
address the Republican National Convention on Monday night.
   Reagan devoted much of his speech to his support of aid for
Nicaraguan rebels, his veto of a defense spending bill that he says
would weaken vital Pentagon programs and his advocacy of ``trade
that is both free and, yes, fair.''
   ``So you see, while the leadership of the other party have been
talking, George Bush and I have been hard at work putting into
practice the ideals you believe in, the ideals that at her heart
America has always stood for, strong defenses, low taxes and
limited government, compassion and fair play . . . faith in our
future and an openness to the rest of the world,'' the president
said.
   ``And, yes, those are just the ideals you will hear us
Republicans rededicate ourselves to this coming week in New
Orleans,'' he said.
   ``You know, I'll be addressing the Republican convention on
Monday, opening night, and taking an active role in the coming
campaign,'' the president said.
   ``But even so, my name won't appear on any ballot this fall.
What's at stake for me in this election is my love for America and
my dreams for her future.''
   ``And that's what my support for Vice President Bush comes down
to,'' he said. ``You see, George Bush understands that the question
for America today is not, `What's different?', but `What's next?'''
   Reagan opened his radio address with a review of recent
administration actions, saying, ``Some in the other party are
parading around the country, talking and talking about what they
claim they'd do if they were elected.''
   ``Well, while they talk, we deliver,'' he said.

<HEAD>IRA Says It Killed British Soldier In Belgium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSTEND, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army on
Saturday claimed responsibility for killing a British soldier in
this North Sea port and urged civilians and families not to travel
with British troops.
   Belgian police, meanwhile, continued to search for two men who
gunned down Warrant Officer 1st Class Richard Michael Heakin, 38,
of the Royal Regiment of Wales' First Battalion, on Friday night.
   The British Defense Ministry said Heakin was going home on leave
from his base at Moenchen Gladbach, West Germany, and planned to
take a ferry Friday night to Dover, England.
   Heakin was attacked as he waited in his car at a traffic light
an hour before the ferry's departure. Two men in their 20s
approached his car, one opened fire and both men fled on foot
toward a city park, a Belgian police official said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Officials said Heakin, who was married and had a 9-year-old son
and a 7-year-old daughter, died at the scene.
   The IRA claim for the Friday night attack came in a statement to
the news media in Britain.
   The outlawed group wants to drive the British from Northern
Ireland and unite the mostly Protestant province with the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
   ``We reiterate our call to civilians and the families of
soldiers not to travel with Crown Forces personnel,'' the statement
said.
   Heakin was in civilian clothes but drove a British-made Vauxhall
with British Army of the Rhine tags.
   After the shooting, police took witnesses to the ferry dock to
try to identify the assailants from among passengers on two ferries
to Dover. They were not spotted.
   The IRA intensified its campaign against British security forces
on Aug. 1 when it bombed a barracks in north London, killing one
soldier and injuring nine. Attacks last week in Northern Ireland
killed five people.
   In March 1987, the IRA launched its first attack on British
servicemen on the European continent in about a decade, setting off
a bomb near a British officers' mess at Rheindahlen, West Germany.
Thirty-one people were injured.

   A schoolboy who says his parents are too
poor to pay school tuition has offered to sell a kidney to anyone
needing a transplant.
   ``This may enable me to get the money required to meet my
educational costs so long as there will be doctors to carry out an
operation successfully,'' F.A. Fuko wrote in a letter that the
independent Daily Nation published Saturday.
   Fuko said he was threatened with expulsion from school. But the
letter did not give his age, grade, number of children in his
family, his school's name in the small western Kenya town of Hakati
or the cost of tuition.
   He said his parents were both jobless and landless and were also
unable to meet the family's daily needs.
   Fuko said he sought financial help from individuals and
organizations in Kenya and other unidentified countries.
   ``I now offer to sell one of my kidneys at a cheap price to
whoever has kidney problems and may want to have a kidney
transplant,'' the letter said.

<HEAD>Recount Shows Two Candidates Tied In Legislative Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Republican candidates received the
same number of votes in a primary race for the Georgia Legislature,
and their fate may rest with a woman who was turned away at the
polls trying to vote.
   A recount of the votes Friday from Tuesday's GOP primary showed
state Rep. Ronald W. Pittman and challenger Keith R. Breedlove tied
at 1,633 votes each.
   That may leave the race to be decided by Nancy H. Putney, who
was not allowed to vote Tuesday _ even though she presented a
receipt showing that she is correctly registered.
   Elections officials say she's told them she wants to vote for
Pittman.
   ``It sure does look like that vote has become important, doesn't
it?'' F. Raymond Street, a member of Gwinnett County's Board of
Registrars, said after reviewing the results of the latest tally in
the legislative race.
   County officials have proposed holding a special election for
the seat Aug. 30, when several county races will be decided by
runoffs.
   Either candidate could demand a recount by hand, or Pittman
could demand Mrs. Putney be allowed to vote.
   Election officials acknowledge that Mrs. Putney was allowed to
vote and had a valid receipt indicating she had registered at a
local library, even though she was not listed on their roll of
registered voters.
   ``I just want to make sure that my vote gets counted, so for now
I'm not going to say anything,'' Mrs. Putney said.

   The Senate and House of Representatives rushed
last week to clear their slates of pending business before a summer
recess for the Republican convention. Here, at a glance, are the
week's major actions.

<HEAD>DROUGHT RELIEF</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed America's largest-ever disaster relief
bill, a $3.9 billion package to provide aid for farmers suffering
crop losses because of the drought or other calamities. The bill
whisked through Congress this week with overwhelming support in
both houses.
   Farmers who lost more than 35 percent of their expected harvest
will receive payments equal to 65 percent of the lost income.
Farmers whose crop losses exceeded 75 percent of the expected yield
would receive payments equal to 90 percent of lost income.

<HEAD>JUSTICE CONFIRMATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Senate unanimously confirmed Richard L. Thornburgh as
attorney general, replacing Edwin Mese III, who resigned.
   Confirmations are expected next month for Harold Christensen as
deputy attorney general; Francis A. Keating II as associate
attorney general, and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. as chief of the
criminal division.
   All four were recommended unanimously for confirmation by the
Senate Judiciary Committee, which acted on Thornburgh's nomination
Wednesday by voice vote, without debate. The other three, who
already are serving at their posts in acting capacities, were
cleared by the panel Aug. 3, but their confirmations by the full
Senate were delayed by last-minute maneuvering as the Senate broke
for the August recess.

<HEAD>SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The House passed, on a 244-132 vote, legislation to withdraw all
U.S. investment from racially segregated South Africa and impose a
near-total trade embargo. The bill goes to the Senate, where it
faces a possible Republican filibuster and, if eventually passed, a
likely veto by President Reagan.
   Supporters hailed the dramatic measure as a last-chance
opportunity to bring strong economic pressure to bear to help end
South Africa's apartheid system of racial separation by expanding
the less sweeping sanctions adopted in 1986.
   But Republicans said the bill represents a ``scorched earth''
policy that amounts to declaring economic war against South Africa,
a war they said would hurt the blacks it is designed to help by
causing millions to lose their jobs.

<HEAD>INTERNMENT REPARATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan signed a bill providing reparations to
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II. The bill provides
for a $20,000 tax-free payment to each of the 60,000 survivors
among the approximately 120,000 Japanese-Americans who were
interned. The legislation, which cleared Congress by a 257-156 vote
in the House on Aug. 4, calls for a trust fund of $1.2 billion,
with appropriations in any one year limited to $500 million.
Legislation providing the actual money must still be enacted.

<HEAD>CONTRA AID</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 49-47 for a Democratic proposal to provide
Nicaragua's Contra rebels with $27 million in non-lethal
``humanitarian'' aid after Oct. 1. The vote could set the stage for
a second vote on the possible resumption of $16.3 million in
stockpiled military aid later in the year.
   Republicans, none of whom joined in the majority, said the
Democratic plan did not represent a truly bipartisan approach and
could not guarantee aid would reach the rebels inside Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFENSE BILL</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Senate passed its second Pentagon budget bill 90-4, ordering
a major review of U.S. overseas commitments, a limit on American
troop deployments to Japan and South Korea, and a ceiling on
spending for U.S. military personnel stationed overseas. The last
provision requires the allies to pay the difference if deployment
costs of U.S. troops rise above 1988 levels.
   President Reagan last week vetoed Congress' first defense bill
because he objected to cuts in his Star Wars budget and
restrictions on nuclear arms control policy. The new version
retains the same Star Wars reductions, but none of the arms control
limitations. It will now go to a House-Senate conference committee
to resolve differences between the two chambers' versions.

<HEAD>FREE TRADE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The House voted 366-40 to approve a free trade pact signed in
January by President Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney. The agreement would phase out most tariffs on the annual
$166 billion in goods and services traded across their common
border. Tariffs currently apply to about 25 percent of U.S.-Canada
trade.
   The Senate is expected to act on the measure when it returns
next month. It won approval Tuesday from the Senate Finance
Committee.

<HEAD>PAY RAISES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's 4.4 million civilian and military
employees would receive a 4.1 percent pay increase starting Jan. 1
under an agreement by a House-Senate conference committee.
   President Reagan is expected to approve the raise after final
congressional action on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations
bill which authorizes it. That action is likely when Congress
returns in September.
   The $4 billion total cost of the 1989 raise _ which will hike
the salary of the highest-paid career civil servant from $77,500 to
$80,775 _ is to be absorbed by agency budgets already approved or
nearing approval.

<HEAD>Proper Frame of Mind Can Help in Coping With Heat Wave,
Psychologists Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 4 grafs after 8th graf, `In New York ...,' to ADD
study of heat effect on baseball pitchers; Picks up 9th graf,

   Putting yourself in the proper frame of mind can
help you beat the heat as much as plugging in the air conditioner,
psychologists say.
   ``It's a time for people to learn to remain cool,'' said Michael
R. Mantell, chief psychologist for the San Diego Police Department.
He was attending the annual meeting of the American Psychological
Association.
   ``Stop telling yourself it's awful. It's just hot,'' Mantell
said. ``At the very worst, it's an inconvenience.''
   ``It is very comforting to think and to realize that it could be
worse,'' he said.
   Though rainfall eased drought conditions in parts of the
Midwest, much of the nation continued to swelter Saturday, and
power consumption and temperature records fell.
   ``This is like Brazil,'' said Mel Goldstein, director of the
weather center at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury.
``It's tropical weather, with high heat and the water vapor just
absolutely saturating the atmosphere.''
   The temperature reached 90 degrees shortly after noon Saturday
in Windsor Locks, Conn. It was the 12th day of the month with
temperatures at 90 or above, breaking the August record of 11 days
with more than half the month still to go.
   In New York City, Saturday was the 30th straight day with
temperatures in the 90s. Consolidated Edison said electricity use
set a record Friday, while in Boston, heat-related power outages
affected more than 6,000 customers.
   Temperatures in that range may have an effect on the safety of a
top summer pastime. A study released at the meeting Saturday
suggests baseball batters get beaned by pitches more often when the
temperature is in the 90s, maybe because the heat is making
pitchers more aggressive.
   It's not so much that the beanballs are deliberate, but rather
the pitchers may be trying to move batters back from the plate,
prodded by discomfort from the heat, said researcher Alan Reifman.
   ``You might plan to throw it close, and your aim is a little
off,'' he said.
   He and colleagues found that in 21 games analyzed for which the
temperature was in the 90s, pitchers racked up an average of 0.57
hit batters per game. For the remainder of the total 215 games in
the study, the highest average for cooler weather was 0.33, for
games played in the 80s. Lower rates were found for games at lower
temperatures.
   Mantell suggested that one strategy for coping with the heat is
to spend some time alone and take an occasional break from life's
stresses.
   ``During a heat wave you don't want to be a workaholic,'' he
said.
   ``Your thinking can be an internal thermometer to lower the
temperature to what it is outside, instead of what you've
exaggerated it to,'' he said.
   Parents should distract their children from focusing on the
heat, and they should model a cool mental attitude for the children
to see, he said.
   A good line of approach is, ``Boy, it sure is hot, it sure is
uncomfortable, but it will pass. ... I can tolerate it,'' Mantell
said.
   James Rotton, a psychologist at Florida International University
in North Miami, recommended drinking plenty of water rather than
alcohol. Alcohol tends to unleash aggression in hot weather, he
said.
   Studies have given strong evidence that hot weather promotes
assaults between acquaintances, homicides and rape, he said in a
telephone interview.
   Humidity amplifies the effect of heat, but the main problem is
that the body can't shed its own heat when the air is so warm, he
said.
   To cope with heat, as with any stress, Rotton recommended
staying in good physical shape. But don't overdo the exercise in
hot weather, he added.
   Drinking water is important because during hot weather the body
loses water faster than people can detect through thirst, he said.
The result can be heat stroke.

   Baseball batters get hit by pitches more often
when the temperature is in the 90s, maybe because the heat is
making pitchers more aggressive, a study released Saturday suggests.
   It's not so much that the beanballs are deliberate, but rather
the pitchers may be trying to move batters back from the plate,
said researcher Alan Reifman.
   Establishing dominance by throwing close to the batter could be
taken as an aggressive act, prodded by discomfort from the heat, he
said.
   ``You might plan to throw it close, and your aim is a little
off,'' he said.
   But Reifman, a graduate student at the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor, stressed that merely finding a relationship between hot
weather and the risk of beanballs does not prove cause-and-effect.
   He presented his work at the annual meeting of the American
Psychological Association.
   He and colleagues found that in the 21 games analyzed for which
the temperature was in the 90s, pitchers racked up an average of
0.57 hit batters per game.
   For the remainder of the total 215 games in the study, the
highest average for cooler weather was 0.33, for games played in
the 80s. Lower rates were found for games at lower temperatures.
   The analysis was based on statistics from every tenth major
league game played in 1986, as listed in the Los Angeles Times.
   The analysis did not account for night games. But it did
statistically remove the influence of pitcher inaccuracy, as
measured by the number of walks in the game, and possibility of
throwing beanballs as retribution, as suggested by the number of
home runs hit by the opposing team.
   William Fox, who teaches about motivation and behavior within
organizations at the University of Florida in Gainesville, called
the work preliminary but interesting.
   ``Like a lot of research, it's a first cut. It's provocative. It
points to the need to do more research,'' he said.

<HEAD>GOP Sources Say Veep List in Narrowing, as Delegates Arrive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush pondered a shrinking list of
potential running mates on Saturday as Republicans flocked by the
thousands into their hot-and-humid convention city for a week of
politics and partying.
   Bush, his own nomination set for Wednesday night, was said by
one source to have narrowed the list of vice presidential prospects
to a half dozen or so names. ``I'm not saying whom I'm going to run
with,'' was the vice president's comment in an interview with Cable
News Network.
   The roster was said to include two former rivals for the GOP
nomination, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Jack Kemp of New York. Also
in the running were Dole's wife, Elizabeth, Sens. Dan Quayle of
Indiana, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Alan Simpson of Wyoming,
as well as at least one or two others.
   One party source put former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander on
the list.
   Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis interrupted a
weekend on Cape Cod for a news conference that included a tribute
to Bush's ``enormous courage and tremendous patriotism.'' A day
earlier, Bush's account of being shot down in World War II was
questioned by a gunner who witnessed the episode.
   At the same time, he renewed his attack on Reagan
administration's ``irresponsible fiscal policy'' in the wake of
last week's jump in interest rates.
   With Bush in Washington pondering his choices and polishing his
acceptance speech, Republicans spent the pre-convention weekend
lighting up the social circuit.
   There were 500 separate convention-related receptions,
breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, brunches and cocktail parties on
the docket for the week by rough count, not to mention the tourist
attractions that make New Orleans famous.
   ``We had a few delegates come in. They had their badges on,''
said Manny Moreland, the doorman at a club in the fabled French
Quarter where female impersonators dance nearly naked. ``From New
York. Good tippers.''
   A youthful Republican balloon squad worked overtime inflating
enough red, white and blue balloons for next week's celebration.
   Construction crews put the finishing touches on the Superdome
podium where Bush will stand to deliver his acceptance speech next
Thursday night.
   Police reported that 25 groups had signed up to stage protests
in a designated area several blocks from the convention arena. The
list ran the gamut from self-proclaimed anarchists to marijuana
smokers to advocates from the homeless.
   Local politicians worked to take advantage of the publicity
glare focused on New Orleans. Democratic Mayor Sidney J. Barthemey
said he hoped ``people will leave here and will have a positive
view of the city if they already didn't have one.''
   The vice presidential guessing game was the only suspense at the
GOP convention, and one Bush aide said the campaign would ``start
floating a lot of trial balloons, starting Monday. The rumor mill
is going to be fantastic,'' said Steve Schwartz, executive director
of the North Carolina campaign organization.
   Already the speculation had drifted into sarcasm-land. One
Republican showed off a ``Bush-Rather'' button, as if Bush might
pick the CBS anchorman with whom he had an on-air showdown during
the primary season.
   With Bush several hundred miles away in Washington, the
Republican high command worked the convention city.
   Campaign manager Lee Atwater, dismissing a suggestion that
President Reagan would overshadow the vice president at the week's
convention, said, ``The fact of the matter is, George Bush is now
front and center stage, he's the candidate for president, he's the
man people are going to be watching.''
   Reagan, who speaks to the convention on Monday night, said in
his weekly radio address that he will campaign for the vice
president this fall because of ``my love for America and my dreams
for her future.''
   ``Some in the other party are parading around the country,
talking and talking about what they claim they'd do if they were
elected. Well, while they talk, we deliver,'' he said.
   Republican chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the party hoped to
maintain the interest of the prime time audience throughout the
week. The convention will be a success, he said, ``If we can
maintain a program that keeps the American people watching to an
extent greater than the Democrats had and we get out those
messages, a comparison of what it was like, what the Democrats are
really all about with Michael Dukakis and our vision for the
future.''
   Roughing up Dukakis was on the agenda, as well. Massachusetts
Republicans were coming to town with a videotape attacking the
Democratic candidate. ``He talks about things, puts a nice spin on
them, but the facts are quite different,'' said Ray Shamie, head of
the state party.
   Democrats were doing a little roughing up of their own. Vice
presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen called the Republican Party
platform a ``repeat of broken promises'' from the eight years of
the Reagan administration.
   Campaigning in Kingsville in his home state of Texas, Bentsen
said, ``They've got a balanced budget amendment in that platform _
a balanced budget amendment. Remember that in 1980, they had it in
'84.
   ``And they haven't submitted a balanced budget yet to the United
States Congress. Not yet, not one,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gulf Force Being Reduced By Attrition</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with Navy saying four ships
still to be deployed. Pick up 14th pvs, `The Vincennes...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Navy has begun cutting back its
Persian Gulf force by dropping plans to send another sophisticated
Aegis cruiser to the region.
   Although other deployments may go ahead as planned, U.S.
military sources say the move indicates that senior American
officials are confident that an Aug. 20 cease-fire between Iraq and
Iran will succeed, clearing the way for a promised reduction of the
American naval commitment here.
   By a process of attrition, the 27-ship force could be trimmed
considerably by the end of October, although probably not to the
level of ``three, four or five ships'' mentioned by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci in a statement last week, the sources
said.
   To bring it to that size, about where it was last year when the
American naval buildup began, would mean removing the 11-ship
carrier battle group in the Arabian Sea and almost two-thirds of
the 16 ships now in the gulf.
   Six of the ships in the gulf are mine sweepers, whose presence
may be required indefinitely, according to senior U.S. officers.
They say a ``couple of hundred'' mines are still in the waterway.
   First word of the reduction came when Navy sources disclosed
that Friday's scheduled departure of the Aegis-type cruiser Mobile
Bay from its home port at Mayport, Florida, was being ``temporarily
postponed.''
   Pentagon spokesmen said the 9,600-ton Mobile Bay, which had been
marked to replace its sister ship Vincennes in the gulf region,
would remain in the United States while U.S. officials re-evaluated
the situation in the waterway.
   Cmdr. Mel Sundin, a Pentagon spokesman, said a final decision on
the Mobile Bay will depend on an ongoing assessment of ``what level
of forces are needed to ensure continued and unimpeded operations
in the gulf.''
   The military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that meant the ship would head for the gulf only if the
U.N.-sponsored cease-fire collapsed and a new flareup endangered
the Navy's escort operations.
   Cmdr. Mark Baker, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, said
Saturday the Navy had no change in plans to deploy four other
warships scheduled to leave the east coast for gulf duty this week.
He was clarifying a Friday news report that quoted a Pentagon
statement as saying a decision was not made on the deployment.
   The ships include the missile cruiser Josephus Daniels, based at
Norfolk, Va., and the missile frigates Taylor, Aubrey Fitch and
Doyle. The Taylor is based at Charleston, S.C., and the other two
at Mayport.
   Barring a change of orders, they would replace other ships now
serving in the gulf. The present flotilla includes six vessels due
to leave by late September.
   The Vincennes, which arrrived in the region May 22, will depart
for San Diego early next month, U.S. officials said. Some observers
speculated that it might leave sooner because of the uproar over
its attack on an Iranian jetliner on July 3, killing all 290
aboard. The Navy said the crew mistook the jet for an attacking
Iranian fighter.
   A U.S. officer said, however, that ship movements are always
flexible within a certain range, and the Vincennes' schedule would
give time to determine whether the cease-fire would work.
   A decision not to replace the Vincennes with another of the
Navy's billion-dollar Aegis cruisers would reverse a major tactical
decision that backfired on U.S. officials.
   Gen. George B. Crist, commander of U.S. Central Command, said
June 1 that the billion-dollar cruiser, one of the Navy's most
sophisticated warships, was sent to the gulf with multiple
missions. They included monitoring a new Iranian anti-ship missile
site in the Strait of Hormuz and allowing overworked U.S. warships
to have more time in port.
   A month later, the Vincennes shot down the Iran Air A-300
Airbus. The ship was pulled off duty for two weeks during an
investigation of the incident by a team of U.S. officers, then left
the gulf for the Arabian Sea and has not re-entered the waterway.
   Some critics questioned why a warship designed to protect a
fleet over hundreds of miles of open sea was assigned to the gulf,
where the primary threats were mines, small gunboats and aircraft
operating at short range.
   The investigators, in a report now being studied at the
Pentagon, blamed ``human error'' in the heat of combat for the
incident, according to Defense Department officials in Washington.
   Military officers have said the United States could reduce its
forces in the gulf partly by canceling deployment of ships slated
to replace those already performing escort duty for Kuwaiti tankers.
   The United States' Middle East Force, which has operated in the
gulf since the late 1940s, had six ships when the operation began
in July 1987. It since has kept up to three times that many in the
gulf and about ten more outside to provide air support.

   West German protesters threw tomatoes and eggs at
East German guards at the Berlin Wall and communist police hauled
away protesting East German youths Saturday as both sides marked
the barrier's 27th anniversary.
   West Berlin politicians and peace groups lay wreaths during
solemn ceremonies at memorials for the 77 East Germans reported
killed in escape attempts to the West.
   West German newspapers condemned the wall, with one of them
calling it ``a monstrosity.''
   But Communist East Germany's state-controlled newspapers
celebrated the wall's construction and said it contributed to
East-West peace.
   Dozens of West German activists demonstrated in front of the
Brandenburg Gate, a stone gateway directly behind the wall in the
eastern sector. They carried life-sized portraits of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and called on the Soviet leader to pressure East Germany
to tear down the wall.
   In its evening broadcast, West Germany's ZDF television network
showed a handful of East German youths being taken away by East
Berlin police after trying to protest near the wall. The protest
appeared to have been dispersed peacefully.
   About a dozen young people from West Berlin protested late
Friday night at the ``Checkpoint Charlie'' control point between
East and West Berlin, witnesses said, hurling tomatoes and eggs at
guards on the eastern side.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
demonstrators left peacefully after British military police were
called in.
   East German border guards began hastily constructing the 13-foot
wall on Aug. 13, 1961, dividing the city into Eastern and Western
halves. Orders to construct the wall came as the rising flow of
East German refugees to the West threatened to cripple the
Communist nation's economy.
   The official East German explanation for the wall was that it
was needed to prevent a planned attack from the West.
   The East German youth newspaper Junge Welt said in its Saturday
editions the wall was built because ``those who oppose fascism once
promised: No more wars from German territory.''
   Another East German newspaper, Berliner Zeitung, said of the day
construction began: ``As the day dawned, the border was made safe.''
   West German commentators sharply denounced the wall.
   ``People who are in their 30s have grown up with this
monstrosity,'' the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper said. ``It belongs
to their everyday lives ... but the wall is still a horror in a
civilized world.
   ``The wall is also a test for the true value of Gorbachev's
reforms,'' the newspaper said. ``As long as this monstrosity is
standing, Gorbachev's words are only words.''
   Another West German newspaper, the mass-circulation daily Bild,
said in a commentary: ``Today, 27 years later, we speak of ... new
openness and reforms in the East. But the wall still stands _
inhumanity cast in stone, bondage poured into cement.''
   In Washington on Friday, President Reagan called the Berlin Wall
``dramatic proof of communism's failed dream.''
   ``Aug. 13 marks a sad anniversary,'' Reagan said in a statement.
``That wall is a both a scar across the city of Berlin and a symbol
of the division of the German nation and of Europe.''
   Today, armed East German guards patrol the wall around the
clock, and floodlights illuminate it at night.
   The August 13th Working Group, a West Berlin organization that
monitors human rights in East Germany, says 77 people have been
killed in escape attempts from East Berlin since the wall was put
up.
   The last reported death came on May 23, 1987, when a lifeless
body was carried away from the Wall on the East Berlin side.

   The women who chaired Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaign in Virginia has told Democratic nominee
Michael S. Dukakis she will not support him because of positions
taken by party leaders in the state.
   ``I will not violate my personal integrity for anyone's
political gain,'' Mary E. Cox wrote in response to the Dukakis
campaign's solicitation of her support.
   In a letter written Thursday, Ms. Cox said four conditions would
have to be met before she could work for the Dukakis ticket. All
related to political stands taken by Virginia Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles, Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder and Senate candidate Charles S.
Robb.
   The three Democrats declared their support for Dukakis at his
Richmond appearance on Friday, and Baliles was named honorary
chairman of the Virginia Dukakis campaign.
   Ms. Cox said Baliles and Wilder would first have to promise to
assure that legislation is introduced in the General Assembly
imposing comprehensive economic sanctions against South Africa and
commit themselves to abolishing capital punishment in Virginia.
   Robb would have to denounce capital punishment, as well as
ending his support for the Nicaraguan Contras and the Angolan rebel
movement, she said. And Baliles would have to establish an
Arab-American-Virginia Commission similar to the Virginia-Israel
Commission he created two years ago.
   ``Governor Baliles has taken a group of Virginians to Tel Aviv
and has organized Virginians to support Israel politically,
economically, militarily, scientifically and educationally,'' she
said. ``Yet, he has done nothing to date to condemn the brutality
of the Israelis against the Palestinians in the occupied
territories.''

   Half of the estimated 100,000 Soviet
forces in Afghanistan pulled out by Saturday, two days ahead of a
deadline set by a U.N. peace pact, Afghanistan's state-run radio
said.
   Radio Kabul said a Red Army unit crossed the Oxus River Saturday
into Soviet territory to bring the withdrawal to the halfway point.
   The report, monitored in Islamabad, quoted Maj. Gen. Rauli
Helminen of Finland as saying the pullout ``is being completed
according to the schedule'' of an accord signed April 14 in Geneva.
Helminen leads a U.N. observation team.
   U.S. officials in Islamabad earlier said it was likely that
50,000 Red Army soldiers would withdraw by the Aug. 15 target date,
three months after the withdrawal began.
   The Soviets entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to help
Afghanistan's communist government battle the U.S.-backed
guerrillas. The Soviet pullout is to be completed by Feb. 15 under
the Geneva accord.
   The guerrillas are not a party to the agreement, and many
analysts predicted in April that the insurgents would recapture
Afghan cities as fast as they were handed over to government
security forces.
   But latest reports indicate almost all 30 provincial capitals
remain in communist hands.
   ``Our aim is to take the provincial capitals but not at the cost
of innocent lives,'' Azim Nasser-Zia, a spokesman of the
seven-party Afghan Resistance Alliance, said Saturday. The
guerrillas are also known as mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
   Unconfirmed reports said combined guerrilla forces overran most
of the northern provincial capital of Kunduz after Soviet troops
moved out in the first week of August.
   Sources also said about 8,000 guerrillas are preparing to attack
about 7,000 government forces defending the southeastern city of
Kandahar, an ancient provincial capital.
   Guerrillas have seized three other provincial capitals since May
15 but abandoned them days later under heavy Soviet aerial
bombardment.
   On Saturday, Radio Kabul said 13 people died in a rocket attack
on the eastern city of Gardez, about 60 miles southeast of Kabul.
It said the attack occurred Friday, but another broadcast said it
happened Saturday.
   No one claimed responsibility, but the radio blamed the
guerrillas.
   The radio also said 27 ``extremist opposition elements,''
presumably referring to guerrillas, were killed in an attack Friday
in the western province of Herat.
   Many guerrilla leaders cautioned at the start of the Soviet
withdrawal that key cities probably would not fall until the
nine-month pullout was completed.
   ``When the Russians are gone then we can get what we really
need, and that is the people's support,'' Azim said. ``We have many
(Afghan) military people saying, `If you start something then we
will join you.'''
   Pakistani officials, Western diplomats and guerrillas report
hundreds to thousands of Afghan communists have defected to the
resistance since May 15. Both sides claim about 100,000 soldiers in
the field.
   In the Afghan capital of Kabul, President Najib has released
proposals for national reconciliation. But his People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan is divided into three factions. Even if it was
united, it would represent only a fraction of the traditionally
decentralized Afghans.
   Under the Geneva accord, Washington and Moscow agreed to
continue arming their Afghan clients until the other side stopped.
   Soviet forces have left behind vast amounts of military hardware
and ammunition for the Afghan army, some of which has been captured
by the guerrillas.
   Kabul has filed 69 complaints that Pakistan violated the accord
by continuing to allow guerrilla weaponry, most of which is
U.S.-supplied, through Pakistan to Afghanistan.
   U.N. observers have failed to find evidence backing Kabul's
claim. Pakistan's president, Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, denies
knowledge of U.S. weapons supplies.
   Zia, in an interview to Pakistani newspaper editors published
Saturday, predicted Kabul would fall to the rebels in ``two, three
or six months'' but said it was difficult to predict.
   ``It is a question of how many more sacrifices Afghan mujahedeen
will be willing to make and (if) they are willing to pay any price
for their freedom,'' Zia said.

after a 13-foot wave crushed him at Rio's famous Leme beache,
police said Saturday.
   Graham Bart, 36, was at the beach with a Brazilian friend when
the wave hit both and dragged them out to sea on Friday.
   A surfer rescued the Brazilian, but Bart dissapeared. A police
helicopter was called in to help, but strong winds and stormy
weather made the search impossible, police chief Romeo Diamant said.
   Diamant said rescue efforts failed again Saturday because of
strong winds, ``but we do not have doubts about his death.''
   High tides flooded most of the city's coastline Friday and

<HEAD>Son Of Former Stalin Aide Seeks Forgiveness For Father</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet historian says his late father, a member
of Josef Stalin's government, should be forgiven for not opposing
the dictator's purges because he would have been killed and could
not have helped his country.
   Sergo Mikoyan's appeal on behalf of former Politburo member
Anastas I. Mikoyan, titled ``Repentance and Redemption,'' appeared
Saturday in the cultural newspaper Sovietskaya Kultura. The elder
Mikoyan died in 1978.
   The younger Mikoyan, a historian, has written articles in the
Soviet press supporting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
campaign to come to terms with Stalin's legacy. The dictator, who
dominated the Soviet government from the 1920s until his death in
1953, ordered millions of people killed or imprisoned. In his
article, Mikoyan appeared to be clearing his father of possible
guilt in Stalin's purges.
   ``Mikoyan could not help but realize that he shared direct
political responsibility for the establishment of Stalin's absolute
power, and consequently for spreading over the country a regime of
lawlessness,'' the younger Mikoyan wrote.
   However, the historian added, ``for many, the hour of the Great
Redemption has come.''
   He said it was clear that Stalin had support _ including that of
his father _ in carrying out his acts of repression. But he said
the support was obtained through blackmail: either join the team or
be purged, often violently.
   Mikoyan recalled that at a 1937 Communist Party meeting, his
father was appointed to draft a resolution condemning Nikolai
Bukharin, a close associate of Vladimir I. Lenin, who led the 1917
revolution that brought the Communists to power.
   The historian suggests that his father agreed to the fatal
resolution because it already had been prepared. He had no choice
but ``to go up to the rostrum or down into the grave.'' Bukharin
was shot to death in 1938.
   Stalin later banished Mikoyan, an Armenian, to the Armenian
capital of Yerevan ``for communion with repression,'' the historian
wrote.
   Mikoyan considered suicide, his son recalled, but decided
against it to spare his wife and children from suffering because of
their ties to a disgraced ``enemy of the people.''
   Instead, Mikoyan decided to devote his energy to working within
the system in helping the people by building socialism and
modernizing Soviet industry, the historian wrote.
   The elder Mikoyan was named foreign trade commissioner, and
insisted that the secret police keep away from workers he
supervised. They were spared from ``waiting for a nighttime ring at
the door,'' the younger Mikoyan wrote.
   The elder Mikoyan, according to the historian, also intervened
to spare the lives of his friends condemned under Stalin's purges.
   After Stalin's death, Mikoyan and Nikita S. Khrushchev alone
pushed for full condemnation of the dictator and rehabilitation of
his victims, the historian said in defense of his father.
   In 1956, Mikoyan gave a speech condemning Stalin's ``cult of
personality'' and was also instrumental in staving off an attempt
to oust Khrushchev from the Soviet leadership a year later, Mikoyan
wrote.
   For all this, he wrote, his father should be praised.
   What choices, he asked, did his father have: ``To perish as an
enemy of the people and be posthumously rehabilitated? Or to
survive to rehabilitate the living and dead? Finally, to do
something that would help the renewal of the society, even in our
times?''

   Part of a mountain collapsed on an island

<TEXT>
   A computer and radar similar to the type used by
highway patrolmen to clock speeders can be used to warn pilots of
deadly but invisible wind bursts that have sent airplanes into
crashes, tests here have shown.
   Conditions called wind shear and microburst have killed nearly
500 American air travelers and injured more than 200 others in the
past 23 years, according to federal government figures.
   But a two-month test at Denver's Stapleton airport of the
Terminal Doppler Weather Radar system has already enabled flight
controllers to warn jet crews of wind shear conditions.
   On July 11 alone, five jetliners on landing approach were
diverted by air traffic controllers after an automatic warning by
the TDWR computer system.
   The wind shears could have made the aircraft plunge out of
control, said Cleon Biter, the National Center for Atmospheric
Research's project manager in the program.
   A wind shear is any abrupt change in wind speed and direction,
while a microburst is a powerful downward rush of air from a
cumulus cloud that strikes the ground and spreads out in all
directions, creating wind shear conditions.
   Abrupt changes in wind speed or direction pose extreme danger to
aircraft, which get their lift from air rushing across the wing. If
air speed across the wing sharply falls off, the wing loses lift
and the plane falls.
   An airplane flying into a microburst momentarily experiences
increased air speed when it meets the air rushing outward. But on
the other side of the microburst the air is speeding away from the
plane, causing a sharp drop in airspeed across the wing surfaces
and loss of lift.
   If the plane has enough altitude it can recover. If it is
landing or taking off, it may plunge to the ground.
   The search for a way to detect the conditions was intensified
after major crashes, such as the crash at Dallas-Fort Worth on Aug.
2, 1985, that killed 137 when a Delta plane flying out of a
microburst was unable to stay aloft.
   The Federal Aviation Administration is funding the radar test,
in which the National Weather Service, the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology and the University of North Dakota also are
participating. The test ends Aug. 31.
   The demonstration tests are the latest in several FAA-backed
Doppler radar projects done at Stapleton to develop an early
warning system for wind shear, said Donald Turnbull, the FAA's
project manager in Washington, D.C.
   ``The highway patrol uses a Doppler radar gun to measure your
speed (in a car). We're using the same (technique) to check the
velocity of air,'' said Dr. Wayne Sand, NCAR's deputy manager of
research applications.
   ``Doppler radar can see well up into the clouds and try to
determine the formation of microbursts. Doppler can look out to
about 40 miles. We're concentrating within an area of six miles of
the airport, the prime area for wind detection, but we're looking
out 40 miles to see approaching wind gusts,'' Turnbull said.
   When the $3 million prototype system's computer decides the
radar has seen a wind shear or microburst, it tells air traffic
controllers at Stapleton, who warn pilots, he said.
   Turnbull said officials hope contracts for 47 of the units will
be awarded by the middle of October, and be on line at major
airports by 1992. Because contract bidding is under way, Turnbull
would not give cost estimates, but earlier reports have put the
unit price at $5.5 million.
   The new system would replace the older Low Level Wind Shear
Alert System consisting of several ground-mounted anemometers
placed around airports to measure surface wind velocity and
direction.

   Hal Linden is hoping to leave ``Barney Miller''
behind him as he returns to his roots: musical theater.
   But even the character of Don Quixote in ``Man of La Mancha,''
which Linden is playing at Boston's Wang Center, may not be enough
to erase memories of Capt. Miller and his corps of colorful cops in
the hit TV show of 1975-82.
   ``If everybody had their way, I'd still be Barney Miller,''
Linden said. ``With another name, with a different haircut, a new
suit, a different business. As soon as `Barney' was over, they
wanted me to play Barney again, only this time as the head of a
hospital, or running a hotel.''
   Linden, 57, said he loves the theater because it was his start
in show business.
   ``I went into musical theater, really, as a singer, and for 17
years what I did was train to become a musical comedy leading
man,'' he said. ``I did it in `The Rothschilds' (for which he won a
Tony Award), and then I did `Barney Miller' and I never did
musicals again.''
   ``Man of Mancha''' runs Tuesday through next Sunday.

   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer, at a hearing Friday, said

   Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's key
opposition leader, is expecting her first child in late September,
a family member said Saturday. She could be back on the campaign
trail by mid-October.
   Pakistani press had earlier estimated her due date in early
December, sparking speculation that the pregnancy might have
influenced President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq's decision to call a
general election Nov. 16.
   The Harvard- and Oxford-educated Bhutto, daughter of the man Zia
overthrew 11 years ago and later had hanged, startled some Western
admirers last year when she announced she had agreed to a
traditional Moslem arranged marriage to Asif Zardari, a Pakistani
businessman she hardly knew. But she stressed that she had no
intention of giving up political efforts.
   Bhutto, 35, has said that doctors' orders that she rest have
forced her to miss several rallies staged by the Movement for the
Restoration of Democracy, an alliance of nine opposition parties
including her Pakistan People's Party.
   Zia on Saturday dismissed speculation that Bhutto's pregnancy
affected his decision to call the election for November, saying,
``I'm not as dirty and as low as somebody may think I am.''

   A man who pleaded guilty in connection
with an elaborate scheme to sell stolen computer plans to the
Soviet Union has been sentenced to six years in federal prison.
   Kevin Anderson, 30, pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to
violate export laws and wire fraud in a plea bargain that
apparently required his testimony against his alleged
co-conspirator, Charles McVey. He had faced a maximum of 15 years.
   McVey is awaiting extradition from Canada for his role in the
failed caper involving $4 million worth of technology manuals and
programs from the Saxpy Corp. of Sunnyvale.
   Prosecutors had sought a sentence of 12 years for Anderson,
citing the case's ``extraordinary seriousness.''
   But U.S. District Judge William Ingram said at Friday's
sentencing he was mainly concerned about the theft of materials
from Saxpy and less about the purported danger to national security
posed by the 1987 scheme, which was never completed.
   Because of the Saxpy computer's capabilities in antisubmarine
warfare, the case threatened national security, prosecutors
contended.
   ``The American computer technology involved in this case is
among the most sophisticated and highly sought after by the Soviet
bloc,'' the U.S. Department of Commerce said in a statement issued
Friday.
   ``The documents and programs stolen from Saxpy would have
allowed the Soviets to use this technology in anti-submarine
warfare applicatons. ... If the shipments were successful, it would
have been a major blow to our national security.''
   Defense attorneys charged that federal officials had ``hyped''
charges in the case, saying they claimed Anderson had stolen ``the
crown jewels of technology ... when it was really rhinestones at
best.''
   David Ellison, one of Anderson's attorneys, said that with
credit for time served, Anderson could be free in 18 months.

<HEAD>Judge Offers To Reduce Dealer's Sentence If He Gives Names</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge sentenced a drug dealer
to 15 years in prison but offered to reduce the sentence by one
month for every user or dealer he revealed to prosecutors.
   In order to qualify for the reduction, federal prosecutors must
be able to verify that the names given to them are those of actual
dealers or users.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph E. Stevens Jr. said after the
sentencing Friday that he intended to stir up concern among users
``about whether they're really safe doing what they're doing.''
   The defendant, Alfred Griffin, 57, pleaded guilty on May 2 to
using Western Union wire transfers to conceal money sent to
California to buy drugs for Kansas City drug houses.
   Federal marshals took Griffin, who had been free on bond, into
custody. He said nothing during the hearing.
   ``It's a vey unusual sentence,'' Griffin's lawyer, Bruce Simon,
said afterward. ``I think it's very bizarre, frankly. I have some
serious problems with it.''
   Simon said his client did not indicate immediately whether he
would reveal sources, considering the danger it might pose for him.
   In court earlier, Simon told the judge that imposing a harsh
sentence would not work as a deterrent to dealers.
   ``There's just not enough likelihood of getting caught,'' Simon
said.
   Stevens said he devised the sentencing idea on the spot.
   ``I've been concerned about effective sentencing in the drug
cases for a long time,'' Stevens said.
   Within 120 days, the judge will review whether Griffin has
provided names of verifiable drug traffickers or users. Stevens
said he would then trim one month for each name.

   Police credited a black
security guard and a woman who once served in the Israeli army with
saving lives Saturday when a mine exploded in a shopping mall.
   The guard was hospitalized and two whites slightly injured after
the explosion.
   Police said Evette Hassom, a 36-year-old Israeli, spotted the
limpet mine and pushed people out of the area when they ignored her
warnings. They also lauded Moses Biyela, who said his white
supervisor disappeared after ordering him to place a bomb
suppression blanket over the object.
   Biyela, 32, suffered severe burns and lacerations when the bomb
exploded three feet in front of him before he could place the
blanket. He was holding the blanket in front of his body, which may
have saved his life.
   Biyela was quoted by the Sunday Star as saying from a hospital:
``Suddenly I was all alone. People were fleeing all around me.''
The security chief who ordered him to put the blanket on the
plastic-wrapped parcel, ``had disappeared. I was very, very
scared.''
   Ms. Hassom spotted the parcel outside the boutique where she
works and determined it was a bomb. She warned shoppers, but most
people ignored her, so she started shoving them toward the exit.
   Ms. Hasson was quoted as saying she was security-conscious
because of her service in the Israeli army.
   Another limpet mine exploded outside a post office Friday night
near Durban, and police said three people were slightly injured.
The mines can be attached to another surface.
   Nearly 100 bombs have exploded in the country since a national
state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986. Police blame most of
the explosions on the outlawed African National Congress, which is
fighting to topple the white-dominated government and end apartheid.
   The ANC seldom comments on individual bombings but says the
bombing and sabotage campaign is part of its strategy.
   Censorship rules imposed under the emergency ban or restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, most forms of
peaceful protest and a broad range of statements the government
considers subversive.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million black majority has no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   Here is a text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, this coming week the Republican National
Convention will take place in New Orleans, the 32nd such convention
since the Grand Old Party first met in 1856.
   I want to talk about that convention in just a moment, but first
I'd like to tell you a little about what's been taking place here
at the White House in the past few days. And you should know, I
have a special reason for wanting to do so.
   You see in this campaign season, some in the other party are
parading around the country talking and talking about what they
claim they'd do if they were elected. Well while they talk, we
deliver.
   To begin with, I recently vetoed the defense bill that Congress
had sent me. Why? Because Congress, perhaps taking their cue from
the other party's leadership, laid on my desk a bill that would
have set back our nation's defenses severely. I won't stand for
that. Neither will George Bush.
   Now it's up to Congress to come up with a new bill, one that
strengthens our defenses instead of weakening them, and strengthens
our hand still further in dealing with the Soviets.
   Still on foreign affairs, we're seeking from Congress effective
aid for the freedom fighters in Nicaragua. In recent weeks the
communist regime in Nicaragua, the regime the freedom fighters are
opposing, has stalled the Arias Peace Plan, expelled the American
ambassador to Nicaragua, shut down the independent press and
brutally suppressed a peaceful protest.
   Regarding Nicaragua, the leadership of the other party advocates
policies of disengagement and unconcern, policies that would surely
permit the communists to consolidate their power. Indeed the would
permit a communist lock on a nation right here in our own
hemisphere.
   George Bush and I happen to disagree with them. It's our firm
belief that in Nicaragua, the United States has a high moral duty,
a duty to stand for human liberty and to extend our help to those
who are struggling to secure it.
   Turning to matters here at home, we saw the passage this past
week of an important fair housing bill. George Bush and I have
supported stronger, fair housing measures from the first, and I
look forward to signing the measure.
   On Wednesday, I signed legislation that compensates Japanese
Americans who were wrongly interned during the second World War.
And on Thursday, I signed into law the largest disaster relief bill
in our history _ drought legislation that will help the tens of
thousands of American farmers who are suffering from this summer's
terrible shortage of rain.
   So, while the other party talks about compassion, we put it into
action. We're also working on important legislation involving trade.
   And in this connection I might as well admit that the leadership
of the other party has my Irish up. You see they talk as if the
country were in some kind of recession, if not, an outright
depression.
   But the truth is just the opposite. Since George Bush and I put
our economic policies in place, we've witnessed the longest
peacetime expansion in American history, an expansion that has
created over 17.5 million jobs.
   Now the Vice President and I are determined to go still further,
opening America and all the world to still greater trade and
economic growth.
   This past week we saw the implementing legislation for the
U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement move closer to final congressional
approval, and Congress has passed a trade bill, one that more
closely reflects Bush's and my emphasis on world trade that is both
free and yes, fair.
   So you see, while the leadership of the other party have been
talking, George Bush and I have been hard at work putting into
practice the ideals you believe in, the ideals that at our heart,
America has always stood for: strong defenses, low taxes and
limited government, compassion and fair play like that embodied in
the fair housing bill, faith in our future and an openness to the
rest of the world as demonstrated in our trade legislation.
   And yes, those are just the ideals you'll hear us Republicans
rededicating ourselves to this coming week in New Orleans.
   You know, I'll be addressing the Republican Convention on
Monday, the opening night, and taking an active role in the coming
campaign. But even so, my name won't appear on any ballot this
fall. What's at stake for me in this election is my love for
America and my dreams for her future.
   And that's what my support for Vice President Bush comes down
to. You see George Bush understands that the question for America
today is not what's different, but what's next. Until next week,
God bless you.

   Fifty-five more anti-abortion activists were
arrested for blocking the entrance to a clinic Saturday, bringing
the number arrested in the past month to more than 400.
   The 55 protesters arrested at the Atlanta SurgiCenter were
charged with criminal trespass, obstruction of a sidewalk or
highway, and giving a false name, police officials said.
   Like about half of the other anti-abortion protesters arrested
in recent weeks, they refused to identify themselves, calling
themselves ``Baby John Doe'' or ``Baby Jane Doe,'' in solidarity,
they say, with aborted fetuses.
   Authorities have refused to release protesters who won't
identify themselves. Since the demonstrations began July 19 during
the Democratic National Convention, 436 arrests have been made; 215
people were in jail on Saturday.
   The protesters are affiliated with Operation Rescue, a New
York-based anti-abortion group.
   Saturday's demonstration was the fourth in as many days, and the
third straight day of protesting at the Atlanta SurgiCenter in
midtown Atlanta, one of seven area clinics licensed to perform
abortions.
   On Friday, 26 activists were arrested, including the drivers of
four vehicles used to shuttle the demonstrators. The drivers'
arrests marked a new strategy for Atlanta police, who impounded the
vehicles and charged the drivers with being party to a crime.

   A group of conservative Republicans, led by
Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, threatened Saturday to put
up their own candidate for vice president if George Bush fails to
select a running mate acceptable to them.
   Humphrey's group, Coalition For a Winning Ticket, is trying to
exert pressure for a conservative running mate to balance a ticket
headed by Bush. ``The fact is the conservatives are not turned on''
by the Bush candidacy, he said.
   ``We did not come here to act as rubber stamps for the party
hierarchy,'' Humphrey said at a news conference. ``We want to be
given a stake.''
   He said his group is telephoning members of the state
delegations to this week's Republican National Convention to find
out if there is support for entering an alternative vice
presidential choice into nomination, should Bush pick a moderate.
   Humphrey said there is support from ``three or four delegations
that have assured us that they are willing to follow our
leadership'' for such a move.
   The conservatives are gearing up for a rules fight to block a
potential move by the Bush campaign to prevent a vote for anyone
other than the Bush-anointed running mate choice at the convention,
Humphrey said.
   On Friday Bush operatives got a change through the Rules
Committee that would dispense with the roll call vote if there were
only one vice presidential candidate in contention. That change
would have to be voted on by the convention to take effect.
   Some Republicans such as Humphrey contend Bush is not a
conservative in the Reagan tradition.
   Of the six vice presidential possibilities that a key Bush
adviser listed as being on a short list in the running-mate
considerations, Humphrey said only two would be acceptable, Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York, and Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, said Humphrey, is not a hardliner
against new taxes, and Dole's wife, former Transportation Secretary
Elizabeth Dole has never run for office and might need ``on-the-job
training.'' Both Doles, along with Sens. Alan Simpson of Wyoming
and Pete Domenici of New Mexico, are said to be on Bush's short
list.
   Of the people who have at some point been suggested as running
mate possibilities, Humphrey said his group would be satisfied with
Education Secretary William Bennett, New Hampshire Gov. John
Sununu, Colorado Sen. William Armstrong and Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois.
   ``But we're not trying to force anyone down anyone's throat. We
think there are a lot of good people who have been talked about at
one time or another that fit the bill.''
   Bush infuriated some conservatives by selecting moderate New
Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean to deliver the keynote speech Monday night.
Kean does not support the hardliners' anti-abortion positions.
   Humphrey said that in the end he will support the GOP ticket
regardless. But he said of other conservatives, ``If they're not
turned on ... get a real middle of the road establishment
Republican, a lot of these people are not going to be enthused and
I think they'll take a walk.''

   Nearly six weeks after the presidential
election, crowds still shout ``President'' at opposition leader
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who shows few signs of conceding defeat to the
party that has been in power for 59 years.
   His left-of-center movement and other opposition groups continue
an intense war of words for the public trust with the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   ``It would be dangerous to ignore it or scorn it or to minimize
it,'' Octavio Paz, one of Mexico's most prominent writers, said in
an essay published last week.
   Cardenas, the son of one of Mexico's most beloved presidents,
has crossed the nation since the election, claiming he defeated
governing party candidate Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the July 6
elections and calling on people to ``defend the vote'' from alleged
fraud.
   He is drawing crowds despite virtually no coverage by
pro-government television stations. Most newspapers continue to
publish reports about his crusade.
   ``The country identifies the future with Cardenas and Salinas
with the past,'' said Jorge Castanada, a prominent political
analyst.
   Although in control and saluted by world leaders as the winner,
the governing party, known as the PRI, is clearly worried.
   Salinas still is certain to be inaugurated on Dec. 1 to a
six-year term succeeding President Miguel de la Madrid. But the
party has promised internal reforms and offered to negotiate with
the opposition.
   Cardenas rejected negotiations.
   ``There is only one path, and that is the law,'' Cardenas, 54,
told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday. ``We aren't
going to have any negotiations or any alliance that implies
recognition of someone who didn't win the July 6 elections.''
   The governing party claimed victory before results came in.
After a weeklong delay in announcing results, the PRI-dominated
Federal Election Commission said the PRI won.
   On Monday, the Chamber of Deputies, acting as the Electoral
College, begins examining the disputed returns and vote fraud
charges. Its formal declaration of a president is expected by early
September.
   Cardenas and the candidate of the rightist National Action
Party, Manuel Clouthier, have called for nationwide demonstrations
Sunday, on the eve of the session. Both have vocal allies on the
electoral board.
   Cardenas said people's lives will improve once they have a say
in how the country is run. They must continue to insist, peacefully
and through legal means, for clean elections and genuine democracy,
he said.
   Whether the PRI will reform and whether Salinas, a 40-year-old
former planning and budget minister, can fulfill a promise to
restructure Mexico's economy without a national consensus remains
to be seen.
   Cardenas says Mexico could become hard to govern if democratic
reforms don't take place.
   ``What are they going to do'' if people rise up and do not
``recognize authorities which committed electoral fraud?'' he
asked. ``This is something the government and the PRI should
reflect on.''
   But he said he does not expect bloodshed. ``The people are
acting with a lot of sensitivity and with a lot of maturity ... No
one wants violence in Mexico.''
   Until this year, the governing party had never lost a Senate
seat and it had won every presidential race with at least 70
percent of the vote. The party has yet to lose a governorship. The
Cardenas coalition plans to field candidates in the two
gubernatorial races at stake later this year.
   Cardenas insists that a clean Electoral College count will
probably show him the winner and give his coalition at least 10 of
the Senate's 64 seats instead of the four the election commission
claimed.
   He also says that if the Electoral College doesn't toss out
fraud-tainted returns and make public the results from each polling
place, it should call a new election.
   Neither is considered likely.
   The commission has yet to reveal tallies from 25,000 of the
nation's 55,000 polling places. But it says its overall count shows
Salinas won with 50.36 percent. It says Cardenas finished second
with 31.12 percent and Clouthier trailed with 17.07 percent.
   As for the PRI-dominated election complaint tribunal, it has
rejected about 90 percent of nearly 600 fraud charges.
   The outcome of the Electoral College session may be virtually
certain, but it won't perform what was once a mere formality
without public notice.

<HEAD>GOP Platform Called ``Repeat of Broken Promises''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS two grafs at end up update with remarks at Laredo.</NOTE>

   Democratic vice presidential candidate
Lloyd Bentsen on Saturday called the Republican Party platform a
``repeat of broken promises'' from eight years of the Reagan
administration.
   The Texas senator, in a speech to supporters at Texas A & I
University, said he's ``been watching what's been going on at that
Republican convention, what they're talking about in that
platform.''
   ``And from what I've heard of it thus far, it's just a repeat of
some of the broken promises we heard in 1980 and back in 1984,'' he
said.
   The Republican platform committee held meetings in New Orleans
last week and the party's national convention begins there Monday
night.
   ``They've got a balanced budget amendment in that platform,'' he
said. ``Remember that in 1980? They had it in '84.
   ``And they haven't submitted a balanced budget yet to the United
States Congress. Not yet, not one,'' he said. ``Michael Dukakis as
governor of Massachusetts has introduced and passed ten balanced
budgets in a row.''
   Bentsen said the GOP delegates are ``really not in touch with
the working men and women of America.''
   ``They did a poll and found that over 80 percent of them didn't
want any funding of day care,'' he said. ``Now, the vast majority
of the American people understand the need for it.''
   Bentsen press secretary Mike McCurry said the senator was
referring to a poll of Republican delegates conducted by CNN and
USA Today.
   Bentsen is on nine-day campaign trip aimed at preventing an
erosion of Democratic support in his home state. Polls conducted
after the Democratic convention last month showed that Texas would
give its 29 electoral votes to the Democrats. Dukakis is scheduled
to join Bentsen at the end of the trip, and the campaign has bought
television ads to coincide with the effort.
   Vice President George Bush, the certain Republican nominee, also
claims Texas as his home and has been courting the state, too.
   Bush is moving more campaign operations there and has hinted
that the Texas delegation at the GOP convention might be the first
to find out his choice for a running mate.
   ``Is Texas important to this campaign _ you bet it is,'' Bentsen
said Saturday.
   Bentsen, who has said he received 90 percent of the state's
Hispanic vote in his last Senate campaign in 1982, told reporters
Friday night he doubts that President Reagan's appointment of Lauro
F. Cavazos of Texas Tech University as the new secretary of
education would help Bush.
   ``That was so apparent, I don't think it will have any
influence,'' he said. ``As far as getting any political mileage out
of it, I don't think it will. A three-month appointment is not
going to be that impressive to Hispanics.''
   The senator had a full schedule of South Texas events Saturday,
including stops in Laredo and Brownsville. He planned to spend
Saturday night and most of Sunday relaxing at his father's ranch in
McAllen, before heading to Houston for more campaigning.
   In Laredo, Bentsen spoke on local economic issues before the
Border Trade Alliance, a group that promotes better business
relations between the U.S. and Mexico.
   ``We've got to find ways to speed up the flow of people and
goods between Mexico and the U.S.,'' he said. ``But we need more
than a bill board on our side and a factory on the other side.'

   An uneasy peace long prevailed on Manhattan's
Lower East Side, an ethnic melting pot for generations, while the
dopers and drunks, homeless and homesteaders, yippies and yuppies
moved in.
   But then the police arrived one night and all hell broke loose.
   ``It was like downtown Beirut,'' a store owner who spoke on
condition of anonymity said after he watched about 400 police and
450 protesters battle last weekend over a curfew at Tompkins Square
Park, leaving 52 people hurt, 14 of them police officers.
   A week later, the focus is on the actions of police. More than
80 complaints of police brutality have been filed, and U.S.
Attorney Rudolph Giuliani is investigating whether police violated
the civilians' civil rights.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward
initially defended police, but reversed field after watching
videotapes of officers swinging billy clubs with abandon, covering
their badge numbers and trampling people with their horses.
   Koch also lifted the curfew and ordered the park left open
overnight, although an 11 p.m. noise curfew has been enforced. And
in an effort to reduce police-civilian tensions, citizen observers
are joining officers on patrols.
   The area around the park, known as the East Village, has had
deep divisions and frictions.
   The neighborhood's mix has been heady: Germans, Ukrainians,
Russians, Hungarians, Greeks, Poles and Italians; then blacks, then
Hispanics and, more recently, Indians and Koreans. They have been
joined by the down-and-out, by '60s burnouts and by upwardly mobile
young professionals renovating old buildings.
   To the west of the park are vestiges of the Ukrainian and Polish
communities that once flourished: coffee shops, churches, a
community center, clusters of elderly women speaking their native
tongue.
   Along St. Mark's Place is a hippie-punk fusion. Vendors set up
wares on the sidewalk in front of boutiques, galleries and poster
shops. Within a block, you can choose from soy burgers, pizza,
sushi or some sabzee chalow at an Afghan place.
   The riot wasn't caused by this bizarre blend, but the
neighborhood _ with its history of radicalism and tolerance for the
unconventional _ was fertile ground for such a clash.
   Police said they began enforcing a 1 a.m. curfew at the request
of some residents who complained of noise from rowdies who hang out
in the park, which is also a drug marketplace and a dormitory for
the homeless.
   But then, some witnesses said, the police were greeted by a
handful of malcontents throwing bottles.
   TV stations showed videotape of the ensuing violence, including
one officer repeatedly swinging a nightstick at the man holding the
camera.
   Many park regulars and poor residents believe the city and
police are in league with real estate developers to clear the area
of undesirables and attract more affluent tenants.
   They claim abandoned buildings are left empty by landlords
awaiting gentrification and higher rents. The better ones are
rehabilitated and filled with white upper-middle class tenants,
they say.
   ``It's hard to say what the bigger problem is, the lack of
housing, or drugs,'' said Tom Brasuell, 28, a lifelong resident who
is an administrative assistant to Councilwoman Miriam Friedlander.
``Poorer people are definitely getting squeezed out, while people
are doubled up in projects.''
   On the east side of Tompkins Square Park, the housing
deteriorates noticeably.
   ``Walk through and you will find hundreds of buildings that have
been vacant for the last 10 to 15 years,'' said Angel Rodriguez,
who runs a youth program in the area.
   But some buildings that were fixed up now offer apartments that
rent for $1,000 to $3,000 a month or sell for hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
   Hundreds of people live in seemingly deserted shells. The legal
ones _ paying the city rent while fixing up the property _ are
urban homesteaders. Others are squatters.
   ``There's a combination of different races and economic brackets
in a way that is very unique,'' said Michael Shenker, 32, a
composer whose homestead apartment has walls stripped to the studs
but has electricity and a phone. ``It's something that people are
endeavoring to maintain _ they don't want homogenization.
   ``It would destroy a certain poetic quality here. It would also
mean a displacement of us _ that's why tempers flare. It's not
about race, color, religion. It's about money.''
   ``Even with so-called gentrification, it's still cheaper than
the Upper West Side, and it's closer to Wall Street,'' said Stuart
V. Rubinfield, whose real estate company has been in the
neighborhood 15 years.
   ``But it's also avant-garde _ this is the cutting edge of the
art scene,'' Rubinfield said. ``It's really heterogeneous. ... From
the media coverage, you get the idea that there are 100,000 people
in gray flannel suits invading the neighborhood. It's just not
happening.''

   Ethnic Pathan transportation workers set
fire to buses of a rival group Saturday, triggering widespread
rioting throughout the city that left seven people dead and at
least 12 injured, hospital sources and witnesses said.
   Pathans and ethnic Baluchi bus and truck drivers traded gunfire
during the clash and a regional government official said army
troops were rushed in to enforce a curfew after rioting broke out.
   The violence followed a dispute between bus and truck drivers of
the two ethnic groups over the most lucrative routes.
   The Pathans attacked buses operated by Baluchis at the city's
main bus station, according to witnesses, speaking on condition of
anonymity. They said seven buses were burned and several others
damaged.
   The violence spread as the battling groups burned more buses and
fired guns at each other around the city of 550,000 people,
witnesses said.
   Authorities gave no official casualty toll, but hospital sources
said seven were killed and more than a dozen injured.
   Police moved in with tear gas but were unable to halt the
clashes until army troops finally restored order, said Mir
Zafarullah Khan Jamali, chief minister of Baluchistan province
where Quetta is capital.
   Jamali said ``the army troops were called late in the afternoon
to keep people off the streets in seven out of 10 city districts.''
   The desert Baluchi people and the mountain-dwelling Pathans have
clashed before in this region near the Afghan border. Two people
were killed and about seven injured in one such flare-up in Quetta
in January.

   Soviet teams on Saturday began
inspections of four U.S. missile bases in West Germany under
provisions of the superpower agreement to eliminate medium-range
nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Forty Soviet inspectors left the U.S. Rhein-Main Air Force Base
near Frankfurt in the morning accompanied by American military
personnel, the U.S. Air Force said.
   ``The Soviet teams made their declaration ... this morning and
notified United States and German authorities of the destination of
each team. All four sites available for inspection in Germany will
be visited by Soviet teams today,'' said an Air Force news release.
   The Soviets arrived Friday and their leader, Vladimir
Tselinshcgez, told reporters at the Rhein-Main base he hoped the
U.S.-Soviet missile treaty signed in December would lead to
improved East-West relations.
   An Air Force spokesman said the Soviets were inspecting bases
that hold U.S. Pershing 2 missiles, storage sites or maintenance
facilities at Neu-Ulm, 48 miles southeast of Stuttgart; at
Neckarsulm, 24 miles north of Stuttgart; at Weilerbach, three miles
northwest of Kaiserslautern; and in the Frankfurt suburb of Hausen.
   Last month, Soviet inspectors were shown two other missile sites
in West Germany. Soviet teams also have inspected sites in other
West European countries where U.S. medium-range missiles are based
and American specialists have been shown Soviet missile facilities.
   U.S. officials say there are 220 medium-range missiles in West
Germany that come under the terms of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces treaty.
   Accommodations and transportation for the Soviet inspection
teams are arranged by the U.S. Air Force under terms of the
agreement.

<HEAD>Rain, More Record Heat In East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain was scattered along the Mississippi Valley on Saturday and
along the southern East Coast and central Appalachians, and there
was more high humidity and record heat across the eastern half of
the nation.
   Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and atmospheric disturbance
produced heavy showers and thunderstorms over the middle
Mississippi Valley and near a stationary front from Wisconsin
across Minnesota to North Dakota.
   Showers and thunderstorms spread along the southern Atlantic
Coast from Florida to the Carolinas, and a few showers and
thunderstorms developed from West Virginia to western New York.
   About an inch of rain fell in just one hour at both Sioux Falls,
S.D., and Key West, Fla. St. Peters, Mo., near St. Louis, got more
than three-quarters of an inch of rain, most of it in just 10
minutes.
   Alexandria, Minn., got 1.83 inches of rain in the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT, while Park Falls, Wis., got 1.22 inches and Sioux
Falls, S.D., got 1.01 inches.
   During the night in northern Minnesota, 3.50 inches fell at
Hibbing, and more than 4 inches fell at Grand Rapids and Nashwak.
   A tropical depression had formed off the Florida coast, but ship
reports and other observations indicated that it was poorly
organized and no significant change in strength was expected into
Sunday.
   Detroit and Williamsport, Pa., both hit 90 degrees Saturday, for
the 37th day this summer for Detroit and and 38th time for
Williamsport. Many other cities have similar experiences this
summer.
   Temperatures rose above 100 degrees over parts of western
Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. Altus Air Force Base, Okla.,
reached 105 degrees at 2 p.m. CDT.
   The airport just inland from Atlantic City, N.J., hit a record
high for the date of 95. But along the beach, temperatures were
only in the 70s, the National Weather Service said.
   Other record highs Saturday were 92 at Alpena, Mich.; 90 at
Binghamton, N.Y.; and 97 at Hartford, Conn. Muskegon, Mich., tied
its record of 90; New York City tied its record of 96; and Traverse
City, Mich., tied its record of 94.
   At the other extreme, Alamosa, Colo., had a record low of 36.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Arcata, Calif., and Bremerton, Wash., to 106 at Gila
Bend, Ariz. The nation's low Saturday morning was 32 at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the northern Atlantic Coast states across the Great Lakes
region, the Ohio Valley, the upper Mississippi Valley, sections of
the Dakotas and Montana to eastern Washington. Scattered showers
and thunderstorms also were forecast from the Carolinas coast
across Florida, the Gulf Coast states and Arkansas to eastern and
north-central Texas.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast;
ranging from 75 to 85 over northern New England, from northern
Michigan across Minnesota to eastern North Dakota, and from the
northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest; above 100 across
sections of the Plains from South Dakota to Texas; between 100 and
112 in the desert Southwest; and in the upper 80s and 90s across
most of the rest of the nation.

   Demonstrators on behalf of the nation's poor
marched to George Bush's hotel Saturday, kicking off a week of
Republican convention-related protests before Bush or most
delegates had arrived.
   During the convention, which begins Monday, a long list of
anarchists, homosexuals, marijuana smokers, advocates for the
homeless and others, blocked from the convention site, will take
their protests to a nearby city park.
   By the weekend, 25 groups had signed up with New Orleans police
for 90 minutes each of free speech in tree-lined Lafayette Square,
several blocks from the convention at the Louisiana Superdome.
   On Saturday, about 250 members of Association of Community
Organizations for Reform Now marched from near the Superdome to the
hotel where Bush, the party's presidential nominee-in-waiting, will
be staying.
   ``As budget cuts, drugs, unemployment go on, our children are
being murdered,'' said Gerry Bell of New Orleans, one of the
protesters. At the hotel, the protesters presented Bush security
officials with a cablegram asking for action.
   On the way there, the group crossed ahead of a small group of
marchers demanding government action to help AIDS victims and stop
narcotics trafficking.
   The choice of Lafayette Square as the demonstration site rankled
a few activists who had hoped to be in front of the Dome. But some
who had picketed or given speeches in the blistering sun at the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta last month were relieved
at the prospect of stirring things up from a shade-covered podium.
   Twelve New Orleans groups and nine national organizations have
banded together under the label CARE, Coalition Against Republican
Exploitation.
   Associates of CARE have a wide variety of activities planned,
including a kiss-in, an AIDS die-in, guerrilla theater and a rally
to protest the U.S. presence in central America and the Persian
Gulf.
   ``We are involved in non-violent, creative protest,'' said CARE
spokesman Mark Schneider.
   The police department schedule doesn't reveal any ``boxheads''
like the three columnists who showed up in Atlanta with boxes on
their heads to prove the media would make a story out of anything.
   There are skinheads signed up for Wednesday, however, and a
counter-demonstration against their white supremacist views also is
planned.
   Activists for gay rights and women's rights lead the handbill
for Sunday.
   The kiss-in will begin on Canal Street Sunday morning when
marchers pucker up to protest anti-gay sentiments, heading for
historic St. Louis Cathedral for the 11 a.m. Mass.
   The National Organization for Women will parade through the
French Quarter at Sunday noon. CARE will march in protest against
Reagan administration policies en route to a 6 p.m. rally in
Armstrong Park.
   On Monday, an AIDS die-in at City Hall is planned to dramatize
the toll the disease has taken on the gay community.
   ``Anarchists against Republicans and Democrats will be exploding
the myth of government of, by and for the people'' on Monday,
according to a flyer.
   Several organizations dedicated to helping the homeless and
hungry will also make their case at the free speech microphone on
Monday.
   Sikhs, Vietnamese veterans and born-again Christians have
registered to talk on Tuesday.
   ACT UP plans a protest against Imreg, a New Orleans
pharmaceutical company working on AIDS medication, spokesman Mark
Kostopolous said.
   He accused Imreg of profiteering at the expense of gay men.
   The Young Republicans of New Orleans will also speak on
Wednesday.
   Thursday's Lafayette Square schedule includes Theatre Shmeatre,
a group which will act out opposition to government policies.
   Protesting began in earnest Saturday with a smoke-in at
Lafayette Square to focus on ``this administration's complicity in
bringing cocaine to this country,'' Schneider said.
   ``Boycott white powder ... bring back herb,'' says one poster
featuring a clenched fist, a broken syringe and a marijuana leaf.
   ``A Night of Light and Love,'' also on Saturday, was to honor
the memory of those who have died from acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   The P.B.S Pinchback Conference, sponsored by the New Orleans
Rainbow Coalition, was scheduled for Saturday, trying to ``expose
the Republican Party for their anti-human policies that are causing
great suffering here and abroad.'' P.B.S. Pinchback was the only
black governor of Louisiana. He served 43 days in 1872.

   Three environmental groups assailed the Reagan
administration's energy policy as an ``environmental tragedy''
Saturday and called for a new strategy keyed to greater efficiency,
renewable resources and enhanced production from existing domestic
oil fields.
   They accused Interior Secretary Donald Hodel of ``crying wolf''
over supposed energy shortages in order to press for large-scale
oil and gas development of Alaskan wilderness and environmentally
sensitive areas off the shores of California and New England.
   ``Future generations of Americans may lose priceless national
environmental resources,'' said the report, which was prepared by
the Sierra club and endorsed by two other groups, Friends of the
Earth and the National Audubon Society.
   It said the United States could lead the world in boosting
energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources such as
solar power.
   ``The alternative offered by the Reagan administration is not
just an environmental tragedy, but an energy disaster,'' the groups
said.
   Brooks B. Yeager, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club and author of
the report, told a press briefing the administration ``has opposed,
obstructed and undermined virtually every congressional attempt to
encourage greater energy efficiency or the development of renewable
resources.''
   ``This presidential election year and the coming change to a new
administration offers us a great opportunity to refocus our sights
on achievable national energy goals which will significantly
improve our overall energy security,'' he said.
   Yeager praised Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis'
interest in ``energy efficiency alternatives'' and his opposition
to oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
and off northern California.
   He said Republican candidate George Bush ``has not fundamentally
offered a new vision of energy policy. The Republican platform and
Vice President Bush's statements seem to indicate business as
usual.''
   The report called Hodel's energy planning record disastrous,
saying he ``has used the prospect of impending energy shortages to
promote massive energy development schemes'' throughout his career.
   An Interior Department spokesman, David Prosperi, commented
about the Sierra Club report: ``From all appearances it's nothing
more than a lot of hot air.''
   ``It's ironic that these individuals who accuse Secretary Hodel
of crying wolf are the same ones who screamed that oil prices would
go through the ceiling when President Reagan deregulated the price
of oil. And they were the same doom sayers who predicted the demise
of the caribou herd in (Alaska's) Prudhoe Bay because of energy
activity, when in fact the caribou herd has tripled in number,''
Prosperi said.
   Yeager said the 3.2-billion-barrel reservoir of oil said to
underlie the Arctic coastal plain ``is dwarfed by the billions of
barrels of oil remaining in already exploited domestic oil
reservoirs.''
   ``We need to encourage infill drilling and enhanced recovery
techniques so that we can develop this resource,'' he said.
   And raising new car and light truck average efficiency standards
from the current 26 miles per gallon to 40 mpg would save more than
30 billion barrels of oil, Yeager said.
   ``The potential for American development of both passive and
active solar energy has hardly begun to be tapped,'' he added.
``Other countries, including Japan, are making a more serious
effort to develop this technology.''

   Two young men died in the past five weeks while
running races in sweltering heat as part of a competition that pits
company teams against one another, authorities said.
   Fred Lebow, head of the New York Road Runners Club, said the
men, age 23 and 24, were non-runners who competed without adequate
preparation for the 3{-mile races.
   Organizers acknowledged that participants in the second race
were not told that someone had died three weeks earlier in the
first race.
   The races in Central Park, which drew thousands of competitors,
were sponsored by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. as part of
its Corporate Challenge series.
   Anthony Mezzina, 24, of North Bergen, N.J., an employee of the
Manhattan brokerage firm Spear Leeds & Kellogg, collapsed during
the race July 14 and died a day later.
   David Reynolds, 23, of Bergenfield, N.J., a technical writer for
Glasgal Communications in Northvale, N.J., collapsed shortly after
completing the Aug. 4 Corporate Challenge race. He died three days
later.
   The deaths were disclosed Friday in an article in New York
Newsday.
   Temperatures were in the 80s at the time of both races.
   Lebow said he and other race officials tried to warn the 10,000
runners in the Aug. 4 race about the dangers of running in the
heat, but didn't disclose the earlier death. Both of the
participants who died had signed waivers stating they were in good
shape and had trained for the race, Lebow said.
   Dr. Andres Rodriguez, the Road Runners Club's medical director,
said he distributed a ``medical alert'' to team captains Aug. 3
warning of the risks. ``I didn't think it was my place to call
attention to (the first death),'' he said.
   After the first death, the day after a July 14 race, team
captains were told to warn runners about running in extreme heat,
but weren't told of the death.
   According to Hanover's John Getzoff, the races are designed to
pit teams from various corporations in a friendly spirit of
competition. The races are held in 13 U.S. cities as well as
Dublin, Ireland; Oslo, Norway; and London. Top teams compete in a
championship race in New York each November.
   Dr. Patrick Griffin, associate director of medical service at
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, said Mezzina's body
temperature was 106 when he was admitted and Reynolds' was 107. He
said Mezzina was ``clearly out of shape'' and that Reynolds told
him he had not run more than a mile since high school.

   The Roy High School soccer team played soccer
so long they forgot who and where they were and at times even
forgot how to play.
   Their more than 75-hour effort was an attempt to get into the
Guinness Book of World Records for the longest soccer game ever
played.
   The team began play Monday at noon. Seventy-five hours, 30
minutes and more than 520 goals later, the players came off the
field Thursday afternoon with what they hope will hold up as a
world record.
   The official record of 74{ hours is held by a team from Wales.
   ``Of course, there's joy and excitement at breaking the record,
but that's subsided as we've reached the moment,'' said Coach Scott
Snelson, who joined in the marathon so there would be 22 players,
enough for two teams. ``Now drowsiness, aches and pains have taken
over.''
   He said that during the ordeal, the team battled fatigue-induced
hallucinations and illness. Snelson said one team member tried to
build sand castles with the dirt near one of the goals. Another
imagined he was a small boy again, playing with his cars and trucks.
   Four players dropped out, but rules for the record attempt
allowed eight players to leave the game without disqualification,
Snelson said.
   School officials now must document the accomplishment to have
Guinness editors confirm the record.

   Beatles fans got a chance this weekend to romp
through Strawberry Fields Forever on a Magicial Mystery Tour or
take a Yellow Submarine and arrive Yesterday after A Hard Day's
Night.
   The occasion was Beatlefest '88, a two-day gathering for fans of
the former musical group that opened Saturday at a hotel near
O'Hare International Airport.
   ``If you're a Beatle fan you'll get a tremendous charge out of
it,'' said Irwin Blum, one of the organizers. ``It's a joyful
event.''
   For $15 a day, followers of the Fab Four got to partake in
non-stop Beatles activities in eight ballrooms, including movies,
sound-alike bands, trivia contests, auctions and a flea market.
   More than 6,000 fans from 30 states were expected to attend the
50th Beatlefest since 1974. Many of the fans were attending their
first Beatlefest, while others have made all 50, Blum said.
   ``They're all ages _ 9 or 10 years old, others in their 30s,
40s, and even some in their 60s come,'' he said. ``Some were not
even born when the Beatles were playing. They are a lovely, quiet,
peaceful group of people.''

<HEAD>Hussein Meets PLO Leaders</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   King Hussein met with PLO leaders Saturday
to discuss future relations after Jordan's move to sever ties with
the Israeli-occupied territories, Jordan's official news agency
said.
   Hussein announced two weeks ago he was ending administrative
links with the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where 1.5
million Palestinians live.
   The news agency said Hussein met with Mahmoud Abbas, Abdullah
Hourani and Mohammed Milhem, all members of the Palestine
Liberation Organization's Executive Committee; and Hani al-Hassan,
a senior adviser to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   ``The delegation presented to the king a full evaluation on the
Palestinians' current situation and the PLO directives following
Jordan's recent measures to sever legal and administrative ties
with the West Bank,'' the agency said.
   It also said the PLO's recent actions ``enhanced the
organization's role worldwide and gave it an international
prominence.''
   The agency said the king ``explained to the delegation the
national motives and considerations of the Jordanian moves and the
stable position of this country toward the Palestinian issue.''
   No details on the positions of the two sides were given.
   Hussein said he was stepping aside to give the PLO
responsibility for the West Bank, which he ruled from 1948 until
the Israeli military occupied it in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Jordan had kept strong ties to the territory despite the Israeli
occupation, and U.S. officials and some Israelis hoped that a joint
Jordanian-Palestinian delegation could be included in future peace
talks.
   In severing ties, the king halted payments to government workers
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, suspended the lower house
of parliament with its 30 West Bank representatives out of 60, and
eliminated a ministry devoted solely to West Bank affairs.
   The moves gave rise to speculation that Hussein might be trying
to set up the PLO for failure by inviting it to assume
responsibilities it cannot fulfill. Jordan, which fought a war in
1970-71 to expel Palestinian commandos from its territory, has a
history of strained relations with the PLO.
   No concrete decisions or actions were announced after Saturday's
meeting. The official news agency said only that the PLO delegation
``expressed the PLO's appreciation for the king's considerations
and his interest in supporting the Palestinian issue and the rights
of its people.''

<HEAD>Former Congressman Otto Passman Dies At 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Otto E. Passman, whose 30 years in Congress
ended in scandal involving a Korean businessman and allegations of
favoritism toward associates, died Saturday at age 88.
   He died at St. Francis Medical Center in Monroe, according to
the Mulhearn Funeral Home. Garland Shell, a family friend, said
death was due to a heart attack.
   Passman, a grade-school dropout who rose from poverty to become
a successful businessman, was first elected to Congress from a
largely rural district in northeastern Louisiana in 1946.
   The conservative Democrat was the powerful chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations from 1954 to
1976, the year he was defeated in a bid for a 16th term. It was in
that post that he developed a reputation as an outspoken opponent
of foreign aid.
   ``For many years, he was the most popular public official in
this part of Louisiana,'' said former Gov. John J. McKeithen. ``He
was a man of great honor, of great integrity and extreme loyalty.''
   Passman survived 15 elections without serious opposition. But in
1976, he lost to fellow Democrat Jerry Huckaby by more than 8,000
votes in the state's open primary.
   During that campaign, Passman was accused of browbeating foreign
governments into making grain deals that benefited his associates.
   He denied allegations that he used his office to pressure
foreign governments to ship their rice on vessels owned by St. John
Maritime Co. of California.
   He was also accused of favoring the Connell Rice and Sugar Co.
of Westfield, N.J., which got a reported $680 million in contracts
under the Food For Peace Program in the 1970s.
   Passman maintained that he was doing his duty by finding foreign
markets for American farm produce, and then seeing that American
companies profited from his efforts.
   But a New York Times report said Passman was the largest
beneficiary of cash payments from Korean businessman Tongsun Park,
who was accused of buying influence in Congress. The Times said
Passman got $190,000 from Park.
   After leaving office, Passman was indicted on a variety of
federal charges in 1978 but was acquitted.
   Passman was born June 27, 1900, near Franklinton, a child of
tenant farmers. He dropped out of school at 14, eventually becoming
a prosperous businessman as head of the Passman Wholesale Equipment
Co., a commercial refrigeration firm, and Passman Investment Co.
   After service in the Navy in World War II, Passman won his first
term in Congress.
   His battles over foreign aid and other issues made headlines,
but he denied charges that he was trying to eliminate all foreign
aid.
   ``They have accused me of trying to wipe out the whole
program,'' he once said. ``That's not true. I have been trying to
contain it.'' But in the next breath, he said he'd rather have no
foreign aid at all than have the program that existed.
   In 1960, he returned from the Democratic convention describing
himself as ``politically sick, disgusted,'' and announced he
wouldn't vote for John F. Kennedy. In 1966, he vigorously attacked
President Johnson for allegedly leading the nation into socialism.
   In a 1984 interview, Passman said he hadn't gotten used to
retirement.
   ``I hate it,'' he said. ``I just don't like the idea of not
doing anything.''
   He is survived by his wife, Martha Passman. Funeral services
were set for Monday in Monroe.

   Here are excerpts from the final draft of the
Republican Party platform for 1988. The platform committee meets on
Monday afternoon to vote on adopting the draft as their final
report.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Preamble</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An election is about the future, about change. But it is also
about the values we will carry with us as we journey into tomorrow
and about continuity with the best from our past.
   On the threshold of a new century, we live in a time of
unprecedented technological, social, and cultural development, and
a rapidly emerging global economy. This election will bring change.
The question is: Will it be change and progress with the
Republicans or change and chaos with the Democrats?
   Americans want leadership to direct the forces of change, on
America's terms, guided by American values. The next stage of the
American experiment will be a new dynamic partnership in which
people direct government and government empowers people to solve
their own problems and to have more choices in their lives.
   In 1984, we said, ``From freedom comes opportunity; from
opportunity comes growth; from growth comes progress.''
   In 1988, we reaffirm that truth. Freedom works. This is not
sloganeering, but a verifiable fact. It has been abundantly
documented during the Reagan-Bush administration in terms of real
jobs and real progress for individuals, families, and communities
urban and rural. ...
   Defending and expanding freedom is our first priority. During
the last eight years, the American people joined with the
Reagan-Bush Administration in advancing the cause of freedom at
home and around the world. Our platform reflects George Bush's
belief that military strength, diplomatic resoluteness, and firm
leadership are necessary to keep our country and our allies free.
   Republicans know the United States is a nation of communities _
churches, neighborhoods, social and charitable organizations,
professional groups, unions and private and voluntary organizations
in city, suburb, and countryside. It is we, the people, building
the future in freedom. ...
   At the very heart of this platform is our belief that the
strength of America is its people: free men and women, with faith
in God, working for themselves and their families, believing in the
inestimable value of every human being from the very young to the
very old, building and sustaining communities, quietly performing
those ``little, nameless, unremembered acts of kindness and love''
that make up the best portion of our lives, defending freedom,
proud of their diverse heritages. ...
   This is what the American people do, quietly, patiently, without
headlines, as a nation of communities, every day. This is the
continuing American revolution of continuity and change.
   This is the American people's true miracle of freedom. It is to
them that we dedicate this platform.

   Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned
leader of the outlawed African National Congress, has been
hospitalized with a lung ailment, the South African Press
Association said Saturday.
   Mandela, 70, was in satifactory condition at Tygerberg Hospital
in Cape Town, where he was admitted Friday and was being treated
for fluid around his left lung, reports said.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, her youngest daughter, Zindzi, and
Mandela attorney Ismail Ayob flew to Cape Town from Johannesburg on
Saturday to visit Mandela.
   Mrs. Mandela ``was shocked by his condition. She certainly is
concerned,'' Ayob told Worldwide Television News after they
returned to Johannesburg.
   ``I'm in a bit of a difficult position because it seems as if
the doctors were instructed to say as little as possible to Mrs.
Mandela,'' said Ayob. ``She knows very little about the problem. I
think the prison authorities do know what the problem is and they
should be able to give you a statement on his condition and the
nature of his illness.''
   Mrs. Mandela made no comment to reporters.
   Col. D. J. Immelman denied Ayob's allegation. ``The Prisons
Service did not instruct doctors to say as little as possible to
Mrs. Mandela,'' he said.
   Dr. J. G. L. Strauss, the hospital's medical supervisor, said
there were indications Mandela is suffering from pleurisy, an
inflamation of the lining of the lungs and he was being treated for
that. He said further tests would be conducted.
   Strauss said Mandela had told him Saturday afternoon he was
``feeling all right.''
   Security police surrounded the hospital and pushed journalists
out.
   Mandela, who has been in prison since 1962, is serving a life
term for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow South Africa's
white-ruled government. The ANC is the main guerrilla group
fighting the government and its system of apartheid.
   He has been incarcerated at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town.
   Censorship rules imposed under the emergency ban or restrict
reporting about treatment of detainees, unrest, security force
actions, most forms of peaceful protest and a broad range of
statements the government considers subversive.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million black majority has
has no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health
services.
   In other reports, a mine exploded Saturday in a Johannesburg
shopping center, injuring a black security guard and two whites. A
similar device exploded outside a post office Friday night near
Durban, and police said three people were slightly injured.
   Police said both explosions were caused by limpet mines, which
can be attached to another surface.

<HEAD>Jobs, Growth and Opportunity For All</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   America again leads the world, confident of our abilities, proud
of our products, sure of our future, the pacesetter for all
mankind. Moving toward the threshold of the 21st century, the
American people are poised to fulfill their dreams to a degree
unparalleled in human history.
   Our nation of communities is prosperous and free. In the sixth
year of unprecedented economic expansion, more people are working
than ever before; real family income has risen; inflation is tamed.
By almost any measure, Americans are better off than they were
eight years ago. The Reagan Revolution has become a Republican
renaissance. Our country's back _ back in business and back on top
again. ...
   From freedom comes opportunity; from opportunity comes growth;
from growth comes progress.
   Freedom is not an abstract concept. No, freedom is the
inescapable essence of the American spirit, the driving force which
makes Americans different from any other people on the face of the
globe.
   ....
   Remember the Carter-Mondale years:
   Taxes skyrocketed every year as the Democrats' inflation pushed
everyone into higher tax brackets.
   Prices spiraled, financially strangling those people least able
to keep up. This was heightened by the spending mania of a
Democrat-controlled Congress. Savings plunged as prices rose. A
dollar saved in 1977 was worth only half by 1981.
   21.5 percent interest rates _ levels not seen before or since _
placed the basic needs of life beyond the means of many American
families.
   .....
   In addition to all of these problems, the Democrats were telling
us that there was something wrong with America and something wrong
with its people.
   Something was terribly wrong, but not with the people. A
half-century of destructive policies, pitting Americans against one
another for the benefit of the Democrats' political machine, had
come to a dead end. The Democrats couldn't find a way out, so the
voters showed them the door.
   Now the ideological heirs of Carter and Mondale are trying again
to sell the public a false bill of goods. These liberals call
America's prosperity an illusion. They fantasize our economy is
declining. They claim our future is in the hands of other nations.
They aren't operating in the real world.
   .....
   This is not a portrait of a people in decline. It is the profile
of a can-do country, hopeful and compassionate, on the move. It is
America resurgent, renewed, revitalized by an idea: the belief that
free men and women, caring for families and supporting voluntary
institutions in a nation of communities, constitute the most
powerful force for human progress. ...
   .....
   Jobs
   The Republican Party puts the creation of jobs and opportunity
first....
   The best jobs program _ the one that created 17 million jobs
since 1982 _ is lower taxes on people. We believe that every person
who wants a job should have the opportunity to get a job. We reject
the notion that putting more Americans to work causes inflation.
   ....
   Opportunity for All
   With its message of economic growth and opportunity, the GOP is
the natural champion of blacks, minorities, women and ethnic
Americans. We urge Republican candidates and officials at all
levels to extend to minority Americans everywhere the historic
invitation for full participation in our party.
   A free economy helps defeat discrimination by fostering
opportunity for all. That's why real income for black families has
risen 14 percent since 1982. It's why members of minority groups
have been gaining jobs in the Republican recovery twice as fast as
everyone else. Upward mobility for all Americans has come back
strong. ...

   The best housing policy is sound economic policy. Low interest
rates, low inflation rates, and the availability of a job with a
good paycheck that makes a mortgage affordable are the best housing
programs of all. ...
   In public housing, we have turned away from the disasters of the
past, when whole neighborhoods became instant slums through federal
meddling. We are determined to replace hand-out housing with
vouchers that will make low-income families neighbors in
communities, not strangers in projects. ...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Controlling Federal Spending</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan-Bush policies of economic growth have finally turned
around the deficit problem. Through Republican-initiated
constraints on spending, the federal budget deficit dropped by over
25 percent last year. With the help of the Gramm-Rudman law and a
flexible budget freeze, a balanced budget can be expected by 1993.
   But the relentless spending of congressional Democrats can undo
our best efforts. No president can cause deficits; Congress votes
to spend money. The American people must prevent big-spending
congressional Democrats from bringing back big budget deficits; we
must return both the Senate and the House of Representatives to
Republican control for the first time in 36 years.
   In 1981, we inherited a federal spending machine that was out of
control. During the Carter-Mondale years, spending grew by 13.6
percent annually. We cut that growth rate in half, but the cancer
still expands, as it has in some States such as Massachusetts where
the budget has increased more than twice as fast as the federal
budget. ...
   It's time to push through the Republican agenda for budget
reform to teach the Congress the kind of financial responsibility
that characterizes the American family:
   We call for structural changes to control government waste,
including a two-year budget cycle, a super-majority requirement for
raising taxes, a legislatively enacted line-item veto, individual
transmission of spending bills, greater rescission authority for
the chief executive and other reforms.
   We call for a flexible freeze on current government spending. ...
   We call for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. If
congressional Democrats continue to block it, we urge the states to
renew their calls for a constitutional convention limited to
consideration of such an amendment. ...

<HEAD>Opening Markets Abroad</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   America's best years lie ahead. Because Republicans have faith
in individuals, we welcome the challenge of world competition with
confidence in our country's ability to out-produce, out-manage,
out-think, and out-sell anyone.
   This is the voters' choice in 1988: compete or retreat. The
American people and the Republican party are not about to retreat.
   To make the 1990s America's decade in international trade,
Republicans will advance trade through strength. We will not accept
the loss of American jobs to nationalized, subsidized, protected
foreign industries and will continue to negotiate assertively the
destruction of trade barriers: ...
   We will not tolerate unfair trade and will use free trade as a
weapon against it ...
   The bosses of the Democrat party have thrown in the towel and
abandoned the American worker and producer. They have begun a
full-scale retreat into protectionism, an economic narcotic that
saps the life out of commerce, closes foreign markets to U.S.
producers and growers, and costs American consumers billions of
dollars. The Democrats' plans would endanger 200,000 jobs and $8
billion in economic activity in agriculture alone! ...

industrial policy planning by government in favor of the
market-oriented policies underlying what foreign leaders call the
``American Miracle.''
   We encouraged the major economic powers to draw greater guidance

volatility of exchange rates, and removing excessive trade
imbalances.

<TEXT>
   Pilgrims from around the country gathered
at a Roman Catholic Church on Saturday to wait for a miracle during
a weekend of worship in honor of the Virgin Mary.
   National attention has been focused on St. John Neumann Catholic
Church since three parishoners began claiming they were receiving
messages of peace and hope from Mary during weekly recitations of
the rosary.
   Among those messages were reported promises of miracles of
physical and spiritual healing that would occur on Monday's Feast
of the Assumption, the day Catholics celebrate Mary's ascension
into heaven.
   ``I believe something's going to happen,'' said Chrissy Greliur,
a college student from Birmingham, Ala. ``I don't know if miracles
will be physical, but maybe spiritual.
   ``I know there will be a lot of conversions on Monday.''
   Miss Greliur told of her family's own religious conversion
during a pilgrimage to Medjugorje, Yoguslavia, where six youths
have claimed to see apparitions of the Virgin.
   ``It changed my father's life,'' she said.
   St. John Neumann pastor Monsignor Joseph James and several
parishoners had just returned from Medjugorje when three of the
parishoners began reporting the Mary messages.
   Church officials have planned four days of worship capped by a
Monday evening Mass and rosary. Rosaries will also be prayed every
two hours that day beginning at 8 a.m.
   On Saturday, pilgrims, many of them handicapped, weren't waiting
for the organized worship services to begin. People crowded into
the church's tiny chapel to light candles and pray.
   Outside, pilgrims milled around the church's courtyard, picking
up crude crosses made from scap wood left over from building a
rooftop altar for Monday's outdoor service.
   One man took pictures of his handicapped son holding a cross in
front of a fountain.
   Meanwhile, church officials have planned for 20,000 people to
attend the event, but say that number is only a guess.
   ``We don't know how many people will be here,'' said Deacon Joe
Richards. ``Twenty thousand may be too large, or there may be more
than that.''
   Most hotels in Lubbock are filled for the weekend, officials
said.

<HEAD>Reducing the Burden of Taxes</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Republican Party restates the unequivocal promise we made in
1984: We oppose any attempts to increase taxes. Tax increases harm
the economic expansion and reverse the trend to restoring control
of the economy to individual Americans.
   We reject calls for higher taxes from all quarters _ including
``bipartisan commissions.'' The decisions of our government should
not be left to a body of unelected officials.
   The American people deserve to know, before the election, where
all candidates stand on the question of tax increases. Republicans
unequivocally reiterate the no-tax pledge we have proudly taken.
While we wouldn't believe the Democrats even if they took the
pledge, they haven't taken it.
   The crowning economic achievement of the Republican Party under
Ronald Reagan and George Bush has been the dramatic reduction in
personal income taxes. ...
   Republicans know that sustaining the American economic miracle
requires a growing pool of private savings....
   To keep it going: ....
   We will reduce to 15 percent the tax rates for long-term capital
gains to promote investment in jobs and to raise revenue for the
federal government by touching off another surge of economic
expansion. ...
   We call for a taxpayers' bill of rights to give everyone simple
and inexpensive means to resolve disputes with government.
Democrats, using the Massachusetts Revenue Department as a model,
intend to squeeze more out of the public by making the IRS more
intrusive. ...

<HEAD>Beating Inflation</HEAD>

   Today, the dollar is sound again. The Republican economic

...
   The Democrats would drag us back to those dreadful years when
inflation was robbing workers of their earnings, consumers of their
spending power, and families of their savings....
   We can't let them do it again. To sustain the country's economic
expansion, confidence in American monetary policy is vital. The
possibility of imprudent action by government breeds fear, and that
fear can shake the stock and commodity markets worldwide. ...

<HEAD>Regulatory Reform</HEAD>

   This is a success story for the entire nation. Eight years ago,
the country was strangling in red tape. Decades of rules and
regulations from official Washington smothered enterprise, hindered

   At the outset of his administration, President Reagan asked Vice
President Bush to take charge of an unprecedented exercise in
liberty: relieving Americans from oppressive and unnecessary
regulations and controls. With George Bush's leadership,
Republicans turned the tables on the regulators. ...
   The job isn't over yet. We will resist the calls of Democrats to
turn back or eliminate the benefits that reducing regulations has
brought to Americans from every walk of life in transportation,
finance, energy and many other areas....

<HEAD>Caring for Children</HEAD>

   The family's most important function is to raise the next

those goals will determine the course our country takes in the
century ahead. ...
   We seek to minimize the financial burdens imposed by government
upon families, ensure their options, and preserve the role of our
traditional voluntary institutions. Democrats propose a new federal
program that negates parental choice and disdains religious
participation. Republicans would never bar aid to any family for
choosing child care that includes a simple prayer.
   In returning to our traditional commitment to children, the
Republican Party proposes a radically different approach:
   _Establish a toddler tax credit for pre-school children as
proposed by
   Vice President Bush, available to all families of modest means,
to help
   them support and care for their children in a manner best suited

<TEXT>
   Government weather forecasters have become
the lastest group of federal employees to successfully challenge
the Reagan administration's random drug testing program.
   In blocking the testing, U.S. District Judge Robert Schnacke on
Friday cited the government's admission that no instances of drug
abuse or drug-related safety problems have ever been documented
among National Weather Service meteorologists. The testing was
scheduled to begin Aug. 26.
   Justice Department lawyer Richard Hertling contended no such
evidence was needed to allow drug testing of a forecaster whose
misjudgment ``conceivably could kill 300 or 400 people flying in a
jumbo jet in a storm. There's no need to wait for an accident like
that to happen.''
   Three other federal judges, two in San Francisco and one in
Washington, have blocked drug testing programs for federal workers,
including federal prison employees, most of the Veterans
Administration staff and Justice Department employees.
   Another judge in San Francisco has upheld post-accident drug
testing of air traffic controllers.
   The programs stem from President Reagan's September 1986
executive order calling for testing of employees in ``sensitive''
federal jobs.
   The Commerce Department, which includes the National Weather
Service, has declared that all meteorologists and technicians hold
``sensitive'' jobs and should be subject to random urine testing,
with about 5 percent to be tested each year. Illegal drug use would
be grounds for removal from the job.
   Richard Hirn, a lawyer for the 1,000-member National Weather
Service Employees Organization, said the random drug testing
program covers about 3,800 weather service employees, including
supervisors and non-union members.
   Hirn said Schnacke's order applies only to union members, who
filed the suit, but is likely to discourage the service from
conducting any random drug tests.
   Schnacke said the government had offered no evidence that drug
problems exist among meteorologists, much less that public safety
is threatened.
   Schnacke said he could envision ``some remote, lonely weather
station where you might want to take some artificial relief to
change the scenery.'' But, he added, ``invading people's privacy on
the premise that someday, somewhere, somehow, some problem might
arise seems to be going too far.''
   In issuing the injunction, he said the union was very likely to
prove in a trial that the testing violated the constitutional ban
on unreasonable searches.
   The injunction, binding until the lawsuit goes to trial, forbids
drug testing of union members without evidence that an individual
employee is using drugs or is under the influence of drugs on the
job.

<HEAD>Irrigation Killing Aral Sea, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irrigation has dramatically lowered the level of
the Aral Sea, leaving behind briny pools the size of football
fields and 12,000 square miles of land that was once under water,
Pravda said Saturday.
   The article in the Communist Party newspaper, written by
geographer D. Oreshkin, said the sea's level is dropping an average
of 3 feet annually. The article blamed the problem on regional rice
field irrigation.
   ``The loss of the sea is a tragedy for nearby citizens,'' the
article said. ``Fish die and former fishermen become unemployed.''
   The lower levels also have seriously hampered ship deliveries of
coal used for heating in the region, the article said.
   The Aral Sea is sometimes called a lake, but it is properly a
sea because it is a land-locked saltwater body, bounded on the
north by the Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan and on the south by
another Soviet republic, Uzbekistan.
   Environmental problems, once taboo in the official media, are
now discussed more freely under Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness.
   ``The topic of the ecological crisis on the Aral Lake was in the
press, but it looks as though action has been stopped along the
way,'' the Pravda article said.
   ``Not only is the sea dying, but people's patience too,'' the
article said. ``Public opinion in areas near the Aral is painfully
concentrated on the fate of the sea. All hopes are connected with
its revival.''
   Higher than average rainfall over the last two years alleviated
the problem somewhat, but not enough to significantly offset the
drainage, the article said. It said more water was lost through
evaporation than replenished by rainfall and the sea's two main
feeder rivers.
   It said the receding Aral shoreline has left pools of highly
concentrated saltwater throughout the area, some of them as big as
football fields.
   Meanwhile, the saline content in the ground and water near the
lake is so high that nothing will grow, the article said. Oreshkin
suggested an underground drainage system to carry the saltwater
back to the sea.
   Oreshkin also said irrigation water should be used more frugally.
   Regional farmers are dependent on irrigation of their fields of
rice, a main crop of the Central Asian economy.
   Such water problems have also been reported elsewhere.
   In June, the official news agency Tass said authorities in
Kazakhstan, the Soviet republic bounding the Aral Sea on the north,
had halted construction of two irrigation projects for fear of
excessively draining Lake Balkhash.

<HEAD>Well-Known Attorney Edward Bennett Williams Dies At 68</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Bennett Williams, the supreme criminal
lawyer and roguish sports entrepreneur whose spellbinding command
of a courtroom rivaled that of boyhood idol Clarence Darrow, died
Saturday in Georgetown University Hospital. He was 68.
   Williams, owner of the Baltimore Orioles and former president
and part owner of the Washington Redskins, secured his own lofty
niche in American trial lore while still in his 30s. He won fame,
fortune and a phenomenal string of verdicts in an area of the law
where attorneys usually lose and rarely get rich.
   He was an exponent of what he called ``contest living,''
obsessed with victory, a dreadnought in the competitive urges of
man. He gave no quarter, even to the disease that finally killed
him after he had fended off its assault for more than a decade with
oft-tortuous therapy and at least seven operations. Virtually to
the end, he worked hard as ever. ``Either it's going to beat me,''
he said of his cancer, ``or I'm going to beat it.''
   Williams enchanted juries, befuddled prosecutors, defended
pariahs and befriended the mighty. Inside the courtroom, he beat
the best the government could offer; outside of it he gave his best
to government, performing a variety of tough legal missions abroad
and advisory roles at home.
   Sometimes he so irked his adversaries that he drew out the worst
in them. Richard M. Nixon once vowed on tape that ``We are going to
fix'' Williams, a lifelong Democrat who privately called Nixon
``snake brains.'' Had Nixon instead sought his counsel, he would
have burned his tapes and, probably, saved his office.
   Williams frustrated friends, too, in the name of unpopular
clients and causes. Robert F. Kennedy, then counsel for the Senate
Rackets Committee, was a frequent breakfast companion after early
Mass, but Williams enraged him by his successful defense of Jimmy
Hoffa in a 1957 bribery case. During the trial, Kennedy vowed to
``jump off the Capitol dome'' if Hoffa were acquitted. Williams
gleefully replied: ``I'll buy him a parachute.''
   Williams, broad of shoulders and belly, noble of brow over soft,
gray-green eyes, was absolutely monastic during a trial, devoting
every ounce of energy within his 6-foot-1 frame to his client.
Between cases, he was an ornery, fun-loving man who was equally at
ease bending elbows with a pug fighter at Toots Shor's in New York
City or dining with Washington's elite at the White House.
   He defended Hoffa, John Connally, Frank Costello, Richard Helms,
Joseph R. McCarthy, Adam Clayton Powell, Dave Beck, Bernard
Goldfine, Bobby Baker, a secret U.S. agent suspected of murdering
his commanding officer abroad and two Russian diplomats charged
with espionage. Costello, the mobster who was the model for Mario
Puzo's ``Godfather,'' once said: ``I've had 40 lawyers. But Ed's
the champ. Ed's the champ. It's like throwing dice. Man throws the
six, he can't pay off. Ed makes the point. Ed makes the point.''
   In the early days, he was sneered at by many in the legal
establishment for his willingness to defend unsavory characters,
but that merely stiffened his resolve. ``The more opprobrium that
was attached to the client,'' he said, ``the more I relished the
case.''
   That didn't mean he had to like the customer. He treated most
with a certain aloofness. ``I have only two things to say to them:
`Tell me the truth, and understand right now that I am going to
have dictatorial power in running this case.' They all want me to
hold their hands. I'm sorry for them. But I've got no business
babying them when I ought to be out working for them,'' he said.
   Williams' customers also included the Democratic National
Committee _ he served two years as the party's treasurer _ and The
Washington Post, the Ford Motor Co., and Gulf & Western. His firm,
Williams and Connolly, occupied a 10-story building in downtown
Washington, employed scores of lawyers, and was known more
familiarly as the ``Department of Defense.'' Williams' chief
partner, Paul Connolly, died years ago.
   By his own account, Williams personally lost only one ``major''
case, the 1967 fraud and income tax evasion trial of Bobby Baker,
an aide to Lyndon B. Johnson. According to Baker, Williams went
home with him immediately after the guilty verdict and burst into
tears. ``He did not cry a silent gentlemanly stream of tears. His
thick body shook and jerked almost convulsively as he sobbed.
Mucous ran from his nose. I wiped it off, mixed him a stiff drink
and tried to comfort him ... he was inconsolable,'' Baker said.
   He couldn't stand losing outside the courtroom, either. As
president of the Redskins, he spent to get the best, first hiring
the legendary Vince Lombardi (``Winning isn't everything, it's the
only thing'') as coach, and then, after Lombardi's death, George
Allen. Williams was only half-joking when he once said of Allen:
``I gave him an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.''
   When Jack Kent Cooke bought out his share _ and virtual control
_ of the football team, Williams already had acquired a new toy,
baseball's Orioles in nearby Baltimore. The team won the 1983 World
Series with manager Joe Altobelli, but when it began to slump in
1985, Williams promptly dumped him and lured another coaching
legend, Earl Weaver, out of retirement.
   ``He called me a cement head,'' said Altobelli. Williams said he
didn't remember using that particular term, but ``it was not
inconsistent with my thinking on the subject.'' As it turned out,
even Weaver couldn't rejuvenate the Orioles' pitching, and he
retired again after the 1986 season.
   Cal Ripken Sr., the 1987 manager, got the ax after the Orioles
dropped six consecutive games to open the 1988 season. They went on
to lose another 15 straight under new skipper Frank Robinson, and
the team's dismal slide, despite a multimillion-dollar lineup that
included Eddie Murrry, Cal Ripken Jr. and Fred Lynn, was perhaps
the bitterest pill of Williams' waning weeks.
   ``In football,'' he said recently, ``you only have 16 vulnerable
days for depression. In baseball, it's practically every day.''
Despite his deteriorating health, Williams remained in active
control of the Orioles until late May, when he turned over
day-to-day operations to law partner Lawrence Lucchino.
   His competitive urges spilled everywhere. A former colleague,
Pierce O'Donnell, once beat Williams at tennis. ``Ed never asked me
to play again,'' O'Donnell said.
   One year, Williams and his kids showed up at the home of
columnist Art Buchwald for their traditional family game of touch
football before Thanksgiving dinner. But Williams also brought
along an outrageous ringer, a gentleman named Christian Adolph
``Sonny'' Jurgenson, then destined for the Pro Football Hall of
Fame for throwing the purest spirals in the history of the game.
``They still lost,'' Buchwald said. ``It was the greatest
Thanksgiving the Buchwalds ever had.''
   Williams, born May 31, 1920, was a poor boy, the only child of a
floorwalker in a Hartford, Conn., department store. When his father
was laid off during the Depression, he all but abandoned his hopes
of going to college, but the vice principal of his high school got
him a scholarship at Holy Cross, the rigidly disciplined Jesuit
college at Worcester, Mass. He became a star debater, racking up an
unbroken string of victories against eastern colleges. ``We always
tried to figure out gimmicks, something to throw the other fellow
off stride,'' he recalled.
   He joined the Army Air Force in World War II, but was soon
injured in the crash of a training plane _ everyone else aboard was
killed _ and was discharged. He then enrolled at the Georgetown
University Law School in Washington, and, bored by classwork, made
a practice of wandering into the U.S. courthouse to sit through
trials. ``I watched bad lawyers,'' he said. ``I learned a lot from
their mistakes.''
   Even before he passed the bar, Hogan & Hartson, then the
capital's second-largest law firm, hired him on Georgetown's
recommendation. Among his clients were several breweries. In those
days, empty beer bottles were sometimes improperly washed, and
mice, attracted by the smell of yeast, would occasionally climb
into them and die. When the bottles were refilled and sold again,
they became, to some customers, as valuable as gold.
   Williams said he learned one rule of thumb when a beer drinker
charged into court, corpus delecti in bottle, bottle in hand,
complaining of indigestion. If the jury kept its collective
breakfast down, continue to fight; but if just one threw up, a
quick out-of-court settlement was advisable.
   After marrying his boss's daughter, Dorothy Adair, Williams hung
out his own shingle. She died, at age 34, of a respiratory illness,
and Williams married Agnes Neill, then a top lawyer in his own
firm, a year later. He had three children by his first marriage,
four by the second.
   One of Williams' greatest talents, dating to those early
negligence cases, was his skill at cross-examination. ``It is,'' he
said, ``the art of putting a bridle on a witness who has been
called to do you harm ... you must think of him as a man with a
knife in his hand who is out to stab you, and you must feel your
way with him as if you were in a dark room together. You must move
with him, roll with him. You must never explore or experiment
during cross-examination. You must never ask a question if you do
not already know the answer.
   ``Never attack points that are unassailable,'' said Williams.
``And if you hit a telling shot, try not to let the witness know
it. Keep quiet and go on. The time to dramatize it to the jury is
during your closing argument.''
   And nobody closed better than Williams. His calm, accommodating
manner during the trial would, at the end, turn to thunder and
lightning. During the Hoffa trial, for example, he tripped up a key
government witness over a seemingly inconsequential point, and,
true to his own rule, quickly moved on with no show of emotion. But
during the summation, arms and long, wavy hair akimbo, he boomed:
``From this man's lips, we learn that he lies. From this man's lips
we learn that he deceives. From this man's lips were learn that he
falsifies. What kind of man can lie,'' he said, voice now ebbing,
``while carrying the rosary, the symbol of truth, honesty and
beauty...''
   Being in the courtroom with Williams, said O'Donnell, ``was
somewhat akin to having your breath sucked out by a tornado.''
   But Williams didn't try to convince juries by himself. He was a
great believer in the character witness, and produced some
spectacular lineups tailored to the makeup of the jury box. For the
Connally bribery case, before a mostly black jury, he paraded to
the stand one civil rights hero after another to testify to
Connally's integrity.
   Then he called Billy Graham.
   Q: What is your profession?
   A: I teach the gospel of Jesus Christ across the face of the
earth.
   Voice from the jury: ``Amen!''
   Williams, wry grin on his face, said later: ``I thought that
that was a good sign.''
   ``I try to be guided by the ethics I was taught by the
Jesuits,'' said Williams. ``A trial is like a war.''

   People filled the streets of Burma's
capital Saturday to celebrate the resignation of the president one
dissident called ``Burma's Hitler,'' but skirmishes continued
outside Rangoon, diplomats and travelers said.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon said the capital was quiet after
massive protests and violence claimed at least 95 lives during the
17-day rule of hard-line leader Sein Lwin, who resigned Friday.
   But they cited reports of minor skirmishes in the eastern suburb
of Okkalapa and unconfirmed reports of looting and shooting in the
working-class area, where some of the fiercest fighting raged last
week.
   Food and medicine were scarce and barely any transportation was
available into the capital from the countryside, said the
diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Shops reopened and citizens filled the streets to cheer the
resignation of the president they described as the ``Butcher of
Students,'' according to Brett B. Lambert, an American student
returning from Rangoon.
   ``People are smiling and happy,'' Lambert said.
   News reports said students in the capital continued passing out
leflets urging protests to win democracy.
   Lambert said posters on walls of the capital showed Sein Lwin
with blood dripping from his mouth, a skull and crossbones around
his face, and ``massacre'' written beneath.
   ``Burma's Hitler was brought down by the might of all the
people,'' Japan's Kyodo News Agency quoted one Burmese as saying.
   Peter Swan, an Australian film maker returning from Rangoon,
said he visited the Rangoon General Hospital and saw more than 300
people wounded from the demonstrations last week.
   Diplomats said hundreds may have died in the fighting, and
unconfirmed reports said up to 1,000 were killed.
   Rangoon, a city of 3.5 million, had been under a daytime curfew
since Tuesday.
   The diplomats said prices were soaring, food was running low and
hospitals, which normally function at threadbare levels, were
reported seriously short of blood, bandages and other vital medical
supplies.
   Sein Lwin stepped down after reports that Burmese soldiers were
turning against the government and allowing people to march through
some towns in support of democracy and economic reforms.
   Burma's official Rangoon Radio, which announced the resignation,
gave no reason and did not say who Sein Lwin's successor would be.
   ``We're in a kind of wait-and-see mode. The Burmese are very
relieved that Sein Lwin stepped down but basically skeptical about
what it all means,'' one diplomat said. ``Is this cosmetic or is it
a real concession to the demonstrators?''
   Lambert said that before Friday's announcement, large numbers of
troops moved through Rangoon in armored personnel carriers.
Protesters torched buildings, street lights, houses and police
stations in the city, which was under martial law.
   After the announcement, soldiers stationed around Lambert's
hotel withdrew. But Lambert said a number of Burmese told him ``it
was not over yet'' and that much depended on who would be the next
president.
   Josef Silverstein, a leading American expert on Burma, said in a
telephone interview that a likely candidate for president was Kyaw
Htin, a relatively liberal military officer who received some
training in the United States. He has been the No. 3 man in the
government and party.
   Burma's economic recovery is expected to be slow and difficult.
Once one of Asia's wealthiest nations, Burma, is now among the
world's poorest countries with per capital income less than $200 a
year.
   Almost 80 percent of the loans Burma received in 1986 came from
Japan, but Tokyo's aid has been declining.
   Japan on Saturday called for swift economic reforms in Burma and
urged the country to restore order. The Japanese foreign ministry
said economic depression was the major cause of the protests in
Burma.
   Minoru Kiryu of the Asian Economy Research Center in Tokyo said
that with recent aid cuts Japan has been putting pressure on
Burmese leaders to carry out economic and political reforms.
   The economic problems were brought on by the isolationist
policies of Ne Win, who ruled Burma for 26 years. He resigned last
month, citing student unrest in March and June. Sein Lwin was
elected his successor July 26.
   Almost immediately, students, monks, workers and others filled
the streets of Rangoon demanding the new president's ouster. They
blamed the former general for brutally crushing the March and June
student unrest and cited his bloody suppression of Rangoon
University riots after the 1962 coup.
   The protests spread to two dozen other cities and on Tuesday,
soldiers began firing into mobs of demonstrators.
   Reports from Burma indicated security forces in at least two
towns sided with the protesters, and a guerrilla leader fighting
the government called for a coordinated nationwide offensive.

<HEAD>Moderate Named To Top Sikh Post Despite Militan Opposition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TARN TARAN, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate Sikh leader was named
Saturday to be the chief priest of Sikhism despite the objection of
militants fighting for an independent homeland in Punjab state.
   Darshan Singh Ragi was appointed head priest of the Akal Takht,
or eternal throne, by a committee that manages Sikh religious
affairs. As chief priest Ragi will have strong influence over the
finances and political activities of Sikhs throughout India.
   Ragi, 47, had served previously as chief priest but resigned a
year ago to show his disapproval of the bloody campaign by Sikh
separatists.
   His appointment was approved by eight of 10 members of a
15-member selection committee that met at Tarn Taran, 19 miles
south of the Sikh holy city of Amritsar.
   Two members of the committee walked out in protest against Ragi.
Four committee memhbers are in prison and a fifth, Mal Singh
Ghumman, is in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds. He was
attacked by Sikh extremists last month.
   A person describing himself as the spokesman of the Khalistan
Commando Force, an underground Sikh militia force, said the group
would not recognize Ragi as head priest.
   He made the comment in a telephone call to the residence of The
Associated Press correspondent in Amritsar.
   ``Those eight members of the committee will be taught a
lesson,'' said the caller who refused to give his name.
   Khalistan is the name Sikh militants have given to their
proposed homeland.
   At least 1,694 people have been killed in the northern state of
Punjab this year in attacks by Sikh insurgents.
   United News of India said seven people were killed in Punjab by
militants Friday night and six of the victims were Sikhs while the
seventh had not been identified. Both Hindus and Sikh moderates are
the targets of the extremists.
   Ragi has received death threats. He has denounced the
Hindu-dominated federal government, accusing it of discriminating
against Sikhs, but has not supported the separatist movement.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's population of 800 million
but are the majority in Punjab. The insurgents began their battle
for a separate state in 1982. Sikhism is an offshoot of the Hindu
religion.

   We have set forth the foreign and defense policies of the

implement those policies, we propose this integrated national
security strategy for the future....
   International peace and stability require our country's
engagement at many levels. While we cannot resolve all issues
unilaterally, neither can we abdicate our responsibilities by
retrenchment or by relying on the United Nations to secure our
interests abroad. Those who advocate America's disengagement from
the world forget the dangers that would be unleashed by America's
retreat -- dangers which inevitably increase the costs and risks of
the necessary reassertion of U.S. power...
   Although we have established a framework for the future, we
cannot rest on our laurels. The young democracies we have helped to
flourish may yet be overcome by authoritarian pressures. The Soviet
Union can easily revert to past practices....
   As we face the opportunities and challenges of the future, our
policies will be guided by realism, strength, dialogue, and
engagement. We must be realistic about the Soviet Union and the
world we face. Hostile forces remain in that world. Soviet military
capabilities are still dangerous to us. It must be clear to all,
except the leadership of the Democrat Party, that we are not beyond
the era of threats to the security of the United States.
   As we shape our foreign and defense policies, we must never lose
sight of the unique leadership role the United States plays in the
world community. No other nation can assume that role....
   The American people and the Republican Party, in the tradition
of Ronald Reagan and with the leadership of George Bush, are indeed
ready to do so.

<HEAD>Reports Say Cuba May Keep Troops in Angola as Civilians</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Namibia, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba may try to keep its estimated
50,000 military personnel in Angola as civilian workers despite a
commitment to withdraw them under a pact with Angola and South
Africa, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The independent weekly Expresso quoted unidentified diplomatic
sources in Lisbon in its report.
   It said only Cuba was opposed to the section of the accord on
the withdrawal of its troops from Angola but accepted it under
pressure from the Soviet Union.
   The agreement was announced Monday after the fifth round of
peace talks between South Africa, Angola and Cuba, with the United
States participating, ended in Geneva Aug. 5.
   The accord includes a cease-fire that went into effect Monday
and calls for South Africa to begin withdrawing its 3,000 soldiers
from southern Angola.
   It set a deadline of Sept. 1 to reach agreement on a timetable
for the complete removal of Cuban troops from Angola and calls for
South Africa to give independence to South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   South Africa's white-minority government has administered
Namibia since the end of World War I under a mandate of the defunct
League of Nations. That mandate was abolished by the United
Nations, but South Africa has rejected U.N. demands to give the
territory independence. One reason given by the South Africans is
the Cuban military presence in Marxist-ruled Angola.
   Expresso quoted one diplomat as saying, ``The Cubans are
reluctant to pull out of Angola and they are expected to try to
keep them (the Cuban troops) there by getting them civilian
cooperation worker status.''
   The paper reported Cuba's opposition to repatriating its troops
included concern over problems of reintegrating so many soldiers
back into society.
   Angola gained its independence from Portugal in 1975 and Marxist
forces defeated the pro-Western National Union for the Total Unity
of Angola in the civil war that followed.
   South Africa and the United States have supported the guerrillas
while the Angolan government has received assistance from the
Soviet bloc and Cuba.

<HEAD>Senate Works On County Government Reorganization Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain. Time for final vote has not been

<TEXT>
   The Mississippi Senate toiled through a
hot summer Saturday on a county government reorganization bill
inspired by an FBI corruption investigation that snared dozens of
public officials.
   Senators worked their way through 32 proposed amendments, hoping
to pass a version of the bill that could be reconciled with one
passed by the state House on Thursday.
   Lawmakers have been meeting since Wednesday in a special session
called by Gov. Ray Mabus, who instructed them to consider mandating
county supervisors to turn over day-to-day government management to
countywide administrators. Sixty of the 82 counties have some kind
of ``beat'' system, in which supervisors oversee the daily
operations of their individual districts.
   Much of the Senate debate preceded a 32-20 vote on an amendment
to set a Nov. 8 referendum for voters to decide whether their
counties would maintain roads on a district or countywide basis.
   Sen. Terry Jordon argued that the governor should be able to set
a later referendum to leave time for review by the U.S. Justice
Department, which could hear complaints under the Voting Rights Act
of 1965 about whether the reorganization would dilute the voting
power of minorities.
   Sen. Alan Heflin, author of the amendment, argued that counties
involved in the referendum should be spared the expense of running
a special election.
   The House, which adjourned after a brief Saturday session until
2 p.m. Sunday, also set the referendum for Nov. 8, the presidential
Election Day.
   The Senate version of the bill would require counties to
implement central purchasing, receiving and inventory control
systems. They also would be required to implement countywide road
construction, leaving only maintenance for voters to decide.
   Mabus, inaugurated in January, tried unsuccessfully to push a
so-called ``county unit'' bill through the Legislature's 120-day
regular session earlier this year.
   Negotiators were unable to work out differences between House
and Senate versions and the bill died. Mabus then vetoed a bill
that would have given 20 percent pay hikes to all of the state's
410 supervisors and vowed to call the special session.
   Calls for county government reform came in the wake of a federal
crackdown on corrupt county purchasing practices that has so far
resulted in charges ranging from mail fraud to extortion against 56
supervisors in 25 counties.
   Of those, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have been convicted by
juries, one was acquitted, one died before coming to trial, one
died after sentencing and another was declared mentally incompetent
to stand trial. The remainder have charges pending.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Says South Africa Capable of Making Nuclear Bomb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African Foreign Minister Roelof
Botha said Saturday his country has the capability to make a
nuclear bomb ``should we want to,'' but he declined to say if it
has produced any nuclear weapons.
   Botha spoke at a news conference after holding talks with
diplomats from the United States, Soviet Union and Britain, the
three countries with nuclear weapons that have signed the 1969
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   There have been numerous reports in recent years that South
Africa could produce nuclear weapons, and low-level government
officials have indirectly confirmed some of the reports.
   Botha said he could not say whether his talks had brought South
Africa closer to signing the treaty.
   The treaty that has been signed by 137 governments provides for
inspections by specialists of the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency.
   Two states with nuclear weapons, France and China, have not
signed the treaty. Among other countries believed to be capable of
producing nuclear bombs that have not signed are India, Pakistan,
Israel and Libya as well as South Africa.
   Botha said South Africa ``supports the objectives of the NPT
completely.''
   But he added it is ``interested to know if the NPT would be used
in a discriminatory manner against the (South African) government..
.. We want to know exactly what implications flow from signing.''
   ``My task was to come and find out how (the United States,
Soviet Union and Britain) interpret the key issues,'' Botha said.
He did not elaborate.
   Botha also questioned the objectivity of the International
Atomic Energy Agency towards South Africa and it's white-controlled
government.
   African and other third-world countries have repeatedly
attempted to have South Africa ousted as a member of the agency
because of its refusal to sign the non-proliferation treaty. They
also oppose South Africa because of its apartheid policy of racial
segregation.
   At the agency's general assembly last year, a decision on South
Africa's expulsion was postponed following an announcement by South
Africa that it was considering signing the treaty. The general
assembly will holds its annual meeting next month.
   Botha was asked if his talks here were aimed to achieve another
postponment and he said, ``The subject matter is of such importance
that we don't take decisions under the threat of time schedules.''

   Soviets who risk their rubles on everything from
roulette to racing will face tougher penalties against gambling
under new rules adopted by the legislature, Tass said Saturday.
   The official news agency said anybody caught gambling will face
fines of $162 to $810. The average monthly pay in the Soviet Union
is $324.
   ``Persons playing games, like cards or roulette, for money and
valuables and receiving stakes at sport and other competitions in
circumvention of the existing order at racecourses and other
facilities will no longer get off with a warning or a small fine,''
the article said.
   Tass did not say what the fines had been in the past.
   The stricter penalties were in the form of amendments to the
present gambling law. Tass said the Supreme Soviet, the country's
nominal parliament, passed the legislation Thursday.
   The new law calls for severe punishment for repeat offenders.
They could face imprisonment for 12 months, up to two years in a
corrective labor institution, or a fine of $1,620. Authorities
could also confiscate their property.
   Until recently, gambling received little attention in the Soviet
press. But over the last year many newspapers have run stories
warning people of the penalties.
   One Soviet, who asked not to be identified, said she watched a
shell game in progress last week in an underground pedestrian
tunnel.
   The game had attracted a small crowd of people, several of whom
were willing to pay $81 for the chance to guess which of three
thimbles hid a pea.
   ``I watched this for several minutes,'' she said. ``And there
was a lot of money changing hands.''

   The crash of Northwest Flight 255 one year ago
showed ``how fragile human life really is,'' one victim's son wrote
in a poem read to more than 1,000 people at a memorial service
Saturday.
   The crash of Flight 255 at Detroit Metropolitan Airport killed
156 people, including two on the ground, and was the nation's
second-deadliest air disaster. Four-year-old Cecelia Cichan was the
only passenger to survive the Aug. 16, 1987, crash.
   In the poem, Stephen Dresch described seeing a double rainbow
two days after his father, Lewis Dresch, died, and called it ``a
sign to tell us to go on and to remember the bright and the good
times with him.
   `In one short instant we really learn how fragile human life
really is.''
   The poem was read by television newsman Bill Bonds, who said
Dresch sent him the poem and asked him to read it at the service.
   The invitation-only observance at Ford Auditorium on Detroit's
riverfront was organized by a survivors' support group called,
``Flight 255: Their Spirit Lives On.''
   A public service will be held Tuesday night at the site on the
road where the jetliner went down.
   Saturday's service drew a family crowd. Children's exclamations
and cries occasionally accompanied the music and remarks. Those who
lost relatives wore blue ribbon pins with the white bird symbol of
the support group.
   The Rev. Ronald Lund, pastor of Bethany Lutheran Church and a
Detroit Police Department chaplain, said the crash victims are at
peace.
   ``But the problem with us is that we are still here. We still
have all the pain and the sorrow and the grief and the crying,''
Lund said.
   Outsiders can help only so much, he said. ``They have no idea
how you feel unless they had someone on that plane. You can help
each other because you do know. This support group will never allow
your loved ones to be forgotten.''
   A slide presentation of crash victims' photos and their names
was interrupted by mechanical problems, but was shown at the end of
the service.
   Lund said later that 40 to 80 members of the support group meet
at least once a month to talk and plan activities such as the
service.
   The observance marked a turning point, said Kay Gleason, one of
the group's founders. ``I don't mean a way of forgetting, but a
year has gone by and you have to let go. This is one way to do
it,'' she said.
   The group wants to erect a monument with the crash victims'
names, said Betty Polec of suburban Mount Clemens, also a founder.
Her 21-year-old daughter, two months pregnant, and her daughter's
husband died in the crash.

<HEAD>British Diplomat Seeking Release of Hostages Meets Iranian
Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A British diplomat met with Iranian
officials Saturday to seek the release of foreign hostages held in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian extremists.
   David Reddaway arrived in Tehran Friday for what he said would
be a two-week visit. He said he had a ``useful'' first meeting with
officials from Iran's Foreign Ministry, but he declined comment on
the content of the talks.
   Before leaving London, Reddaway said he would speak with
officials here about the 18 foreigners missing and believed held by
pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon, including Anglican envoy Terry
Waite and two other Britons.
   The British Home Office announced last week that Reddaway also
would seek the release or trial of two Britons, businessman Roger
Cooper and tourist Nicholas Nicola, who have been imprisoned in
Iran since 1986.
   Iran's representative in Britain said Thursday the hostage issue
could be resolved if there is good will on all sides and Iran was
trying to help.
   Nine of the 18 foreign hostages are Americans and Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
has been held the longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Waite disappeared in Lebanon in January 1987 while trying to
secure the release of the foreign hostages.
   In London, the Observer newspaper, quoted unidentified Iranian
sources as saying Waite and two other Britons missing in Lebanon
would be released by their abductors ``within weeks.''
   The Observer's Sunday edition reported the sources said Iran
would wait until Reddaway returns to London and then would secure
the release of Waite and television journalist John McCarthy and
teacher Brian Keenan.
   It quoted one Iranian source in London as saying, ``Things are
going smoothly and the hostages should be back within weeks.'' The
report said the source has close links to the Iranian government.
   Keenan, from Northern Ireland, has been missing since April 11,
1986, and McCarthy was kidnapped six days later.

   A shuttle bus used to transport track
workers crashed through a fence and into a crowd of spectators
watching a car race at Watkins Glen International Saturday,
injuring four people, officials said.
   The accident occurred behind the grandstand near the end of the
final event of the International Race of Champions series, said
J.J. O'Malley, a spokesman for the track.
   The shuttle bus with only its driver aboard ``veered out of
control, went through a ditch and a spectator fence'' and into the
crowd, said O'Malley.
   Other details of the crash and its cause were not immediately
known, Schuyler County Sheriff's Deputy John Pierce said.
   Four spectators were taken to a hospital in Elmira, where two
were treated and released and two were admitted, authorities said.
   Sandy Parrot, 40, of Odessa was in critical condition with a
pelvic injury, said Arnot Ogden Hospital nursing supervisor Kathy
Good. Jim Siles, 24, of Rochester, was listed in serious condition
with hip, leg and neck injuries, Good said.

   An explosion ripped through part of a
chemical plant that produces a toxic gas Saturday, but officials
said no one was injured and a fire ignited by the blast burned out
about seven hours later.
   The explosion occurred in a pipe carrying the flammable gas
ethylene oxide from a storage tank inside the Rhone-Poulenc Inc.
plant, said Jim Lake, the plant's human resources manager. The
blast set off two fires, one of which quickly died. Workers shut
off the flow to the pipe and allowed the second fire to burn itself
out Saturday afternoon.
   ``There is no danger to the community,'' Lake said before the
fire was out.
   The explosion occurred in a part of the chemical plant sold to
Rhone-Poulenc in 1986 by Union Carbide Corp., which still operates
part of the complex. Union Carbide uses ethylene oxide to make
antifreeze and polyoils, said Union Carbide spokesman Leon McClure.
   The then-Union Carbide plant came under close scrutiny after a
leak of a toxic chemical, methyl isocyanate, at a Union Carbide
plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, killed nearly 3,000 people. The
plant in Institute also produces methyl isocyanate.
   A leak of two other chemicals at the plant in 1985 injured 135
people.
   The blast occurred near a pipe used to carry methyl isocyanate
to a storage tank, but that line was filled with nitrogen on
Saturday, McClure said.
   The Rhone-Poulenc plant is 11 miles west of downtown Charleston
along a 15-mile corridor lined with more than two dozen chemical
plants on the Kanawha River.
   Saturday's 9:30 a.m. explosion shattered windows in nearby
homes, but the area was not evacuated. Lake said the cause of the
explosion was under investigation.
   ``It was scary,'' said Mark Cardwell, who lives in Nitro, about
a mile from the plant. ``I was asleep ... it was a real big boom.
The water bed shook.''
   McClure said ethylene oxide neutralizes as it burns.
   ``I'm sure a small amount got out, but there was no threat to
employees or to the community,'' he said.
   The plant used its own emergency crews to fight the blaze, and
plant officials did not allow police and firefighters inside the
plant. State troopers were finally let in about 10:20 a.m., after
threatening to force their way into the plant.
   McClure insisted Union Carbide cooperated with authorities.

   Suspected Tamil insurgents shot and
killed seven Indian soldiers Saturday after blowing up a railway
bridge linking Colombo with northern Sri Lanka, Indian authorities
said.
   An official at the Indian Embassy in Colombo said the soldiers
were ambushed near the town of Vavuniya, 135 miles north of Colombo.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
soldiers were patrolling railway tracks in the area after Tamil
rebels blew up a nearby bridge to disconnect links between Colombo
and the Jaffna peninsula to the north.
   The latest ambush raises the number of Indian soldiers killed in
Sri Lanka since last October to at least 544. India said last month
that 537 soldiers had been killed but the embassy official said no
updated figures were available.
   India has at least 50,000 troops in Sri Lanka to enforce a peace
accord aimed at ending the Tamil insurgency on the island. The
rebels reneged on the accord last fall and the Indians have since
attempted to disarm them.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Radicals started a campaign for an independent Tamil homeland in
1983, claiming the community was being discriminated against by the
Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population.
   India brokered the peace accord because of the sympathies of its
own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.

<TEXT>
   Voters in a straw poll Saturday said no
by a three-to-two margin to a proposal to bring gambling back to
this island where casinos once flourished.
   Supporters hoped a favorable vote in the nonbinding referendum
would persuade the Texas Legislature to pass legislation enabling
legalized gambling. Proponents lost similar referendums in 1984 and
1987.
   Late Saturday, unofficial returns from all 14 precincts showed
7,368 or 59.3 percent voted against legalized casino gambling to
5,062, or 40.7 percent in favor.
   Both backers and opponents of gambling had predicted a close
vote on the referendum, which was called after a pro-gambling group
gathered enough petition signatures.
   ``There's no way this is going to be a blowout for either
side,'' said Steve Long, coordinator for Galvestonians Against
Casino Gambling. ``This is the closest it's ever been. But I'll say
we'll end up with 54 percent of the vote.''
   Pete Fredriksen, chairman of the pro-gambling group called
Galvestonians for Economic Development, said he'd be content with
merely 50 percent plus one vote.
   The referendum asked voters to approve a gambling district in
Galveston that backers say would include four casino hotels with at
least 500 rooms each.
   If such a measure passed the Legislature, Galveston voters would
have to pass the proposal again in a binding local option vote.
   A week before Saturday's voting, proponents already had spent
more than $100,000, while anti-casino forces listed expenditures of
nearly $70,000.
   In 1984, the proposal attracted a record voter turnout of more
than 12,600 people, but it lost by a 2-1 margin. Last year's
attempt, which again drew more than 12,000 voters, fell by a 3-2
edge.
   Pro-gambling forces estimated that casino taxes would raise
millions for the state and city and that casinos would create
20,000 new jobs in Galveston.
   But opponents, including Mayor Jan Coggeshall and local police,
contended that only developers and casino operators would benefit
from gambling. They said small businesses and others who refused to
live in a casino town would be driven out of the city. They also
worried that approval of the measure would wipe out prolonged
efforts that promote Galveston as a family resort.
   People gambled in the coastal town from about 1925 until a
government crackdown in the late 1950s ran the casino and slot
machine operators out of town.
   Galveston's Hollywood Club, which featured some of the biggest
entertainment names of the era, was the first air-conditioned night
club in the country. In 1957, state officials found some 1,000 slot
machines stored in the club. Some were burned and others were
dumped in the Galveston harbor.

<HEAD>Ortega Says Dukakis Would Bring Better Relations With Region</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega said Saturday
a victory by Democrat Michael Dukakis in November's presidential
election could bring improved U.S. relations with Central America.
   Ortega also said Nicaragua would accept an international peace
force to guarantee security along its border with Honduras.
   The president, speaking to Nicaraguan ambassadors now in
Managua, said Dukakis holds different views on Latin American
policy than those of Vice President George Bush, the Republican
candidate.
   Bush's policy ``is the same as (President) Reagan's, a
confirmation of the Monroe Doctrine, while that of Dukakis is
different,'' Ortega said.
   The Monroe Doctrine, outlined in 1823 by President James Monroe,
asserts that Latin America holds special importance for U.S.
security and other nations should not interfere in the region.
   ``If eventually Dukakis reaches the presidency of the United
States and has the opportunity and capacity to implement the policy
he has announced during the Democratic convention, very important
foundations would be laid ... to establish a dialogue that provides
a new type of relations between the United States, Latin America
and the Caribbean,'' Ortega said.
   Dukakis has opposed resuming military aid to Nicaraguan rebels,
known as Contras. Bush supports such aid and the U.S. Senate voted
last week to provide $27 million in humanitarian assistance to the
Contras.
   Speaking of a possible border peacekeeping force, Ortega said
the Nicaraguan-Honduran frontier ``is a powder keg that could be
made to explode at any minute by the United States to justify an
invasion of Nicaragua.''
   He proposed that a border peace force be put together by Spain,
Canada, West Germany and a country from the Contadora group and its
support nations.
   Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama make up the Contadora
group that was formed in 1983 at a meeting of foreign ministers on
the Panamanian island of Contadora to seek peace in Central
America. Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Uruguay are the support
nations.
   Ortega made a similar proposal after Honduras suggested the
creation of a border peace force in November 1987 at a meeting of
the Organization of American States in Washington.
   Ortega also told the ambassadors that his Sandinista government
will continue a unilateral cease-fire with the rebels until Aug. 31.
   Negotiations on a permanent cease-fire stalled in June. Ortega
proposed Friday that a new round of talks on ending the
seven-year-old war be held in Managua or Washington.

   Another dozen record highs bit the dust Saturday as unseasonably
hot weather continued.
   Residents of the Northeast were suffering even as far north as
Portland, Maine, where a stretch of 13 consecutive days of high
temperatures in the 80s or 90s equaled a record established in
1980, the National Weather Service said.
   Milwaukee tied a record for 33 days of 90 degrees or more in a
year. Detroit's high of 92 marked the 37th day of 90-degree or
higher temperatures and broke the mark of 36 days set in 1934, the
weather service said.
   The weather service reported these record high temperatures for
the date, along with the old record and the year it was set:
   Alpena, Mich., 93, 90 in 1978

<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro on Saturday
accused Washington of trying to dominate Latin America and said
U.S.-Cuban relations will not improve until America changes its
policies.
   The communist leader said the two nations would remain at odds
``while the United States meddles in our countries, while the
United States practices that role of dominance that it has assumed
for itself.''
   But Castro also said he hoped for improved relations with
America. He said he ``came close to applauding'' U.S. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz when Shultz entered Ecuador's Congress on
Wednesday for the inauguration of Ecuador's new president, a
socialist.
   Castro, Shultz and other international leaders were in Quito to
attend the inauguration of President Rodrigo Borja, who has pledged
a non-aligned foreign policy.
   During a two-hour-long news conference, Castro said the huge
foreign debts owed by Latin American nations could not be paid. He
compared attempts by international bankers to collect the debt with
efforts to extract ``the last drop of blood'' from a dying man.
   On another topic, Castro said Cuban-Soviet relations have not
been hurt by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's social and economic
reforms.
   ``I want you to know that there are no problems between
Gorbachev and me,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Much Of $300 Million Airline Antitrust Suit To
Proceed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge, finding evidence that
American Airlines exerted monopoly control over the airline ticket
reservation market, has allowed 12 smaller carriers to proceed with
a $300,000 antitrust suit.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie on Friday also found
sufficient evidence of predatory price-cutting and price
discrimination in American's SABRE reservation system to proceed to
trial on those claims.
   SABRE, along with United Airlines' reservation system, delivers
most airlines tickets sold in the United States.
   Smaller airlines, which pay fees for tickets booked through the
systems, contend that American and United abuse their domination in
the computer reservation market by charging high fees and imposing
restrictions that make it difficult for travel agents to switch to
rival systems.
   American and United counter that the fees are needed to
compensate for the millions of dollars invested in computers and
data banks. American says it has invested $400 million in SABRE.
   The judge's decision means a jury may decide whether American
has engaged in anti-competitive business practices and it left open
the possibility that a jury can decide whether United may have
engaged in a limited monopoly over the computer reservation market.
   The judge dismissed claims that American and United wielded a
monopoly over the entire airline industry, saying both airlines
make up only a small portion of the airline market.
   Lawyers for both American and the smaller carriers both
expressed satisfaction with the ruling.
   ``We're pleased that our legal theory has been judicially
vindicated, and we have an opportunity to try these charges,'' said
Maxwell M. Blecher, an attorney for USAir, one of the carriers
challenging American and United.
   ``On balance, we're very pleased with the outcome,'' said
American lawyer J. Edd Stepp Jr. ``To the extent the judge did not
agree with us, all he's said is the plaintiffs have raised enough
of a factual issue that he's not going to decide this (without a
jury trial).''

<HEAD>Edward Bennett Williams, ``Contest Living'' Exponent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Bennett Williams, trial lawyer and
owner of the Baltimore Orioles and former president and part owner
of the Washington Redskins, was a man who believed in winning _
what he called ``contest living.''
   Williams enchanted juries, befuddled prosecutors, defended
pariahs and befriended the mighty.
   Sometimes he so irked his adversaries that he drew out the worst
in them. Richard M. Nixon once vowed on tape that ``We are going to
fix'' Williams, a lifelong Democrat who privately called Nixon
``snake brains.''
   Williams frustrated friends, too. Robert F. Kennedy, then
counsel for the Senate rackets committee, was a frequent breakfast
companion, but Williams enraged him by his successful defense of
Jimmy Hoffa in a 1957 bribery case.
   During the trial, Kennedy vowed to ``jump off the Capitol dome''
if Hoffa were acquitted. Williams gleefully replied: ``I'll buy him
a parachute.''
   One of his clients was Frank Costello, the mobster who was the
model for Mario Puzo's ``Godfather.'' Costello once said: ``I've
had 40 lawyers. But Ed's the champ. Ed's the champ. It's like
throwing dice. Man throws the six, he can't pay off. Ed makes the
point. Ed makes the point.''
   In the early days, he was sneered at by many in the legal
establishment for his willingness to defend unsavory characters,
but that merely stiffened his resolve. ``The more opprobrium that
was attached to the client,'' he said, ``the more I relished the
case.''
   That didn't mean he had to like the customer. He treated most
with a certain aloofness. ``I have only two things to say to them:
`Tell me the truth, and understand right now that I am going to
have dictatorial power in running this case.'
   ``They all want me to hold their hands. I'm sorry for them. But
I've got no business babying them when I ought to be out working
for them,'' he said.
   By his own account, Williams said Bobby Baker's tax evasion
trial was the only ``major'' case he ever lost.
   Baker recalls that Williams went home with him immediately after
the guilty verdict and burst into tears. ``He did not cry a silent
gentlemanly stream of tears. His thick body shook and jerked almost
convulsively as he sobbed. Mucous ran from his nose. I wiped it
off, mixed him a stiff drink and tried to comfort him ... he was
inconsolable,'' Baker said.
   When Jack Kent Cooke bought out his 13 percent share of the
Washington Redskins football team, Williams already had acquired
baseball's Orioles in nearby Baltimore.
   The team won the 1983 World Series with manager Joe Altobelli,
but when it began to slump in 1985, Williams promptly dumped him
and lured another coaching legend, Earl Weaver, out of retirement.
   ``He called me a cement head,'' said Altobelli. Williams said he
didn't remember using that particular term, but ``it was not
inconsistent with my thinking on the subject.''
   As it turned out, even Weaver couldn't rejuvenate the Orioles'
pitching, and he retired again after the 1986 season.
   A graduate of Holy Cross, Williams enrolled in Georgetown
University Law School and, bored by classwork, made a practice of
wandering into the U.S. courthouse to watch trials. ``I watched bad
lawyers,'' he said. ``I learned a lot from their mistakes.''
   Even before he passed the bar, Hogan & Hartson, then the
capital's second-largest law firm, hired him on Georgetown's
recommendation.
   Among his clients were several breweries. In those days, empty
beer bottles were sometimes improperly washed, and mice, attracted
by the smell of yeast, would occasionally climb into them and die.
When the bottles were refilled and sold again, they became, to some
customers, as valuable as gold.
   Williams said he learned one rule of thumb when a beer drinker
charged into court, corpus delecti in bottle, bottle in hand,
complaining of indigestion. If the jury kept its collective
breakfast down, continue to fight; but if just one threw up, a
quick out-of-court settlement was advisable.
   His competitive urges spilled everywhere. A former colleague,
Pierce O'Donnell, once beat Williams at tennis. ``Ed never asked me
to play again,'' O'Donnell said.
   One year, Williams and his kids showed up at the home of
columnist Art Buchwald for their traditional family game of touch
football before Thanksgiving dinner. But Williams also brought
along an outrageous ringer, a gentleman named Christian Adolph
``Sonny'' Jurgensen, then destined for the Pro Football Hall of
Fame for throwing the purest spirals in the history of the game.
``They still lost,'' Buchwald said. ``It was the greatest
Thanksgiving the Buchwalds ever had.''
   One of Williams' greatest talents was his skill at
cross-examination. ``It is,'' he said, ``the art of putting a
bridle on a witness who has been called to do you harm ... you must
think of him as a man with a knife in his hand who is out to stab
you, and you must feel your way with him as if you were in a dark
room together. You must move with him, roll with him. You must
never explore or experiment during cross-examination. You must
never ask a question if you do not already know the answer.
   ``Never attack points that are unassailable,'' said Williams.
``And if you hit a telling shot, try not to let the witness know
it. Keep quiet and go on. The time to dramatize it to the jury is
during your closing argument.''
   Nobody closed better than Williams. His calm, accommodating
manner during the trial would, at the end, turn to thunder and
lightning.
   During the Hoffa trial, for example, he tripped up a key
government witness over a seemingly inconsequential point, and,
true to his own rule, quickly moved on with no show of emotion.
   But during the summation, arms and long, wavy hair akimbo, he
boomed: ``From this man's lips, we learn that he lies. From this
man's lips we learn that he deceives. From this man's lips were
learn that he falsifies. What kind of man can lie,'' he said, voice
now ebbing, ``while carrying the rosary, the symbol of truth,
honesty and beauty.''
   Being in the courtroom with Williams, said O'Donnell, ``was
somewhat akin to having your breath sucked out by a tornado.''
   But Williams didn't try to convince juries by himself. He was a
great believer in the character witness, and produced some
spectacular lineups tailored to the makeup of the jury box. For the
Connally bribery case, before a mostly black jury, he paraded to
the stand one civil rights hero after another to testify to
Connally's integrity.
   Then he called Billy Graham.
   Q: What is your profession?
   A: I teach the gospel of Jesus Christ across the face of the
earth.
   Voice from the jury: ``Amen!''
   Williams, wry grin on his face, said later: ``I thought that
that was a good sign.''
   ``I try to be guided by the ethics I was taught by the
Jesuits,'' said Williams. ``A trial is like a war.''

   About 1,200 U.S. military personnel
on Saturday ended two weeks of anti-subversion training with 800
Honduran soldiers in central Honduras.
   During the exercises the troops also did construction work,
donated school supplies, distributed food, built furniture for
government schools and provided medical and dental service,
according to the government. About 30,000 people live in the region
around 35 miles northeast of the capital of Tegucigalpa.
   ``Our army has improved its combat capacity with this exercise,
which will allow us to efficiently defend national sovereignty,''
Col. Roberto Martinez Avila, head of the armed forces chiefs of
staff, said at a ceremony closing the maneuvers.
   The United States and Honduras have held more than 60 joint
military exercises since 1982 involving rotating U.S. troops
including National Guard units.
   About 1,100 U.S. military personnel are stationed at Palmerola
air base 35 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa.
   Nicaragua's left-wing Sandinista government has said the
maneuvers jeopardize Nicaraguan sovereigny.

   A 30-year-old physician was charged
Saturday with murdering his wife with a garden ax and drowning
their infant daughter.
   Dr. Lee E. Robin was charged with two counts of first-degree
murder and was being held without bond until a hearing Monday in
Cook County Circuit Court in Skokie, police said.
   The body of Annette Robin, 28, was found in an upstairs bedroom
and Denise, 2{ months, was discovered dead in a half-filled bathtub
at the family's two-story, brick home in this quiet Chicago suburb,
Cmdr. Thomas Smith said.
   The ax, three-feet long with a wooden handle, was found in the
bedroom near Mrs. Robin's body, Smith said.
   ``He (Robin) called police at 8:12 a.m. and indicated something
very bad had happened at his house,'' said Smith.
   Police Sgt. Dwain Nelson said he did not know whether a motive
had been determined.
   Robin had recently finished an internship at Humana Hospital in
Hoffman Estates, police said.

   The young boys and girls of the Midland
Boys Club had spent the last week practicing for an out-of-town
softball tournament, but their trip ended in tragedy.
   Five lost their lives and 12 others in a Boys Club van were
injured, four of them critically, in a collision Friday with a
tractor-trailer near Sweetwater in west Texas. The truck driver
also was injured.
   ``It's truly a miracle any of them are alive,'' said Nolan
County Sheriff Jim Blackley.
   Elsewhere, multifatality traffic accidents killed a total of 16
people in Illinois, Ohio and Florida.
   Midland Boys Clubs officials Saturday thanked people in the
community for their sympathy and response during the tragedy.
   ``In particular, we are grateful to those who we do not know,
whose faces we have not seen, those who provided swift medical
attention to our children,'' said Chuck Clarkson, chairman of the
board of the boys club.
   Trooper David Gonzales said the van was nearly alongside the
Coca-Cola truck when the van driver apparently dozed off and
swerved onto a grassy median. The driver, attempting to regain
control, oversteered the van directly into the path of the truck,
Gonzales told The Dallas Morning News.
   Gonzales said the van, with 17 passengers, was overloaded. He
said there should have been no more than a dozen passengers.
   The van was returning from a softball tournament in Abilene
earlier in the day. Clarkson said the tournament was to cap the
summer program for underprivileged youth in Midland.
   ``They had been practicing pretty hard for the softball
tournament, and they were really excited about it,'' he said.
   A memorial service was planned for Sunday afternoon.
   The driver of the van and nine occupants remained hospitalized
Saturday in hospitals in Lubbock and Abilene. The truck driver was
released Saturday, but refused interviews.
   In other multifatality accidents:
   _Four students at the Orlando Naval Training Center died
Saturday when a pickup truck crossed the median and struck their
compact car head-on in the Orlando, Fla., suburb of Bithlo.
   _A tractor-trailer truck slammed into a car early Saturday in
Granite City, Ill., killing five of the car's occupants and
injuring two others. In Columbia, Ill., three young women were
killed in a five-car accident Friday.
   _A collision between two vans at a rural intersection in the
northwestern Ohio town of Kenton killed four people and injured
five others Friday night.

<HEAD>Five Questionable Deaths Among Findings of Hospital Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state review of a Brooklyn hospital found five
questionable deaths, improperly stored radioactive waste and
records so sloppy that a man's chart identified him as a woman.
   The state Department of Health made the findings during a
two-week survey of the 620-bed Interfaith Medical Center, the Daily
News reported in Sunday's editions.
   The 95-page report said the hospital failed to provide proper
care in 16 cases, more than half of which involved deaths,
including five that state officials said were questionable but were
not noted in doctors' special files as required by law, the
newspaper said.
   It said two 55-gallon drums and at least four large plastic bags
were filled with radioactive waste. They were not protected from
tampering and were left exposed to the weather and vermin.
   The report, which cited dozens of violations, also said one
woman's normal gall bladder was unnecessarily removed and a
79-year-old heart patient's leg was amputated without her
permission.
   ``The deficiencies are very serious and ones that involve many
key areas of the hospital,'' said Wayne Osten, director of the
state's Bureau of Hospital Services.
   Theodore Jamison, the hospital's president, said he had just
received the report and was not prepared to comment.
   The not-for-profit hospital was created five years ago when
Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and St. John's Episcopal Hospital merged.
   In 1986, Interfaith's two facilities, 81 clinics and its
emergency wards handled more than 200,000 patient visits.
   Lars Larmon, a hospital spokesman, said Interfaith is $20
million in debt. He said the administration has been using money
from its operating budget to pay for physical improvements of the
antiquated Brooklyn Jewish site, resulting in ``a shortage of
medical supplies, materials and everything else.''
   Larmon said 14 percent of its admissions are the working poor or
homeless.
   Osten said the financial problems cannot be accepted ``as
adequate justification for the medical, nursing and
quality-assurance problems we have identified.''
   The hospital has until Sept. 8 to create a corrective plan of
action.

   Small-craft operators from central Florida to the
Carolinas were advised to stay in port Saturday as a tropical
depression with winds up to 50 mph swept across the Atlantic Ocean
toward the Southeast coast.
   Showers and thunderstorms with gusty winds moved along the coast
from Cape Canaveral, Fla., through Georgia, and the system was
expected to move inland Saturday night.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center
estimated that the broad, diffuse center of the system was about 85
miles east of Brunswick, Ga., said Bob Sheets, center director.
   The system was moving toward the west-northwest at 15 to 20 mph
and was expected to keep that general course and speed.
   The depression's highest sustained winds were clocked at 35 mph
in squalls and thunderstorms well north of the center. No
significant change in strength was expected before the depression
moves inland and weakens, forecasters said.
   ``There were some squalls off to the north and east of the
center with winds up to 50 miles per hour,'' said National Weather
Service meteorologist Mark Zimmer.
   The small-craft advisory covered the coast from Cape Canaveral
northward to South Carolina's Little River Inlet, near the North
Carolina-South Carolina border.

   Heavy rains again flooded this desert
capital Saturday, and a Cabinet minister said international aid
coming in was not enough for the 2 million people left homeless so
far.
   The latest storm began around midnight Friday and lasted until
midmorning, tearing trees from their roots and leaving huge pools
of water in the streets of downtown Khartoum, a city of 4 million.
   The city's airport was shut down and the Nile river was rising,
fueling fears that it might soon overflow and worsen the damge
caused by the flooding.
   The flooding began with a storm Aug. 4-5 that dumped six times
as much rain on Khartoum as the city received in all of 1987.
   In Cairo, the Egyptian daily Al-Gomhuriya said in an
unattributed dispatch from Khartoum that 400 people had died from
the flooding. The Sudanese government has reported 39 deaths.
   Al-Ahram, another Egyptian daily, quoted Sudanese Finance
Minister Omar Nour el-Dayem as saying the number of people left
homeless in Khartoum and three cities in eastern and northern Sudan
had risen to 2 million.
   Nour el-Dayem defended his government against charges it was not
efficiently handling the distribution of relief. He said
international aid already received was ``a drop in the ocean when
compared to the size of the disaster.'' The government has
estimated the damage caused so far at $200 million.
   Western relief agencies urged the Sudanese government to allow
non-governmental organizations help distribute relief supplies.
They said the Sudanese army, which is handling most of the
distribution, was not reaching some of those affected.
   The Cairo daily Al-Akhbar quoted unidentified relief agency
officials as saying the renewed rains, together with the expected
flooding of the Nile, delayed distribution of aid and shortages of
electricity, drinking water and food, creating ``an extremely
dangerous situation'' which was getting worse.
   The officials were quoted as saying the army was having
difficulty distributing blankets, tents, food and other medical
supplies and in some cases, refused to distribute the relief for
``reasons we do not understand.''
   News reports Friday said hundreds of tons of supplies were
waiting in Khartoum for distribution.
   Some of those hardest hit by the flooding were nearly 1 million
people who fled drought and civil war in Sudan's rural areas to
seek refuge in squatter settlements ringing Khartoum.
   One such settlement, Marzouk west of Khartoum, was reduced to a
sprawling collection of crumbling walls and collapsed hovels.
Journalists touring Marzouk encountered no one among its 15,000
residents who said they received any emergency relief.
   ``We need tents and plastic sheets,'' said Abdullahim Idris
Kody, 32. He said his family had slept outside since floods
destroyed his two-room hut.
   Kody said no food or medicine reached Marzouk and children there
were beginning to develop intestinal problems and coughs.
   Several soldiers stood outside six orange army tents, where a
young woman said she was handing out less than 2 pounds of wheat
flour per family daily in addition to supplementary foods including
sardines, dates and sugar.
   But no distribution was seen, and residents complained the
rations were being distributed along political lines and only to
``special families.''
   Information on the relief operation in Khartoum was scarce, and
it was not possible to determine whether the situation at Marzouk
was typical of other settlements.
   Abdul Mohammed of the Sudan Council of Churches said local
non-governmental organizations were trying to care for displaced
people at the settlements but lacked staff and supplies.
   Most of the assistance received so far has come from Arab
nations in the form of government-to-government aid.
   On Friday, Western deliveries began to pick up with the arrival
of Dutch, U.S. and UNICEF cargo planes carrying supplies earmarked
for non-governmental agencies, such as the Sudan Council of
Churches.
   Mohammed said such groups could handle only 15 percent of the
displaced population's needs and would help only the most desperate.

   Ella Royston Udall, 59, the wife of Rep.
Morris Udall, D-Ariz., was found dead in her garage Saturday
morning, an apparent suicide from carbon monoxide poisoning. Police
are investigating.
   Fairfax County Police spokesman Warren Carmichael said Udall
found his wife's body about 10 a.m. in the front seat of her
automobile parked in the family residence.
   ``It's being investigated as a suicide from carbon monoxide
poisoning pending a test by the medical examiner,'' Carmichael
said, noting reports from fire and rescue workers of ``a very heavy
concentration of carbon monoxide in the garage area.''
   Mrs. Udall, who was not breathing when her husband found her,
was rushed to Fairfax County Hospital, but she could not be
revived, he said.
   Robert Neuman, Udall's administrative assistant, said no note
was found, and that Mrs. Udall had been in good spirits.
   A native of Loudoun County, Va., Mrs. Udall had served as a
staff assistant on a subcommittee of the House Post Office and
Civil Service Committee before her Dec. 1, 1968 marriage to the
Arizonia congressman.
   Mrs. Udall, who frequently said she considered being a
congressman's wife a full-time career, is survived by her son,
Vincent Fabrizio Jr., from a previous marriage, and Udall's six
children.
   Udall, 65, has been suffering from Parkinson's disease. However,
he announced his decision in April to seek his 15th in Congress.

   Famed criminal attorney Edward Bennett
Williams, whose clients included union leader Jimmy Hoffa,
congressman Adam Clayton Powell and former Texas Gov. John B.
Connally, died of cancer Saturday in Georgetown University
Hospital. He was 68.
   Williams, who was admitted to the medical facility on Wednesday,
died at 6:15 p.m., according to Georgetown hospital spokeswoman
Anne Klass.
   Williams, who secured his own niche in American trial lore while
still in his 30s moved into the sports world as a part owner and
former president of the Washington Redskins football club and then
as owner of the Baltimore Orioles baseball club.
   Williams, who had suffered from cancer for more than a decade,
was an exponent of what he called ``contest living,'' obsessed with
victory. He gave no quarter, even to the disease that finally
killed him after he had fended off its assault with oft-tortuous
therapy and at least seven operations. Virtually to the end, he
worked hard as ever. ``Either it's going to beat me,'' he said of
his cancer, ``or I'm going to beat it.''
   Joseph Califano, a former law partner and a member of the
President Carter's cabinet as head of the then-Health, Education
and Welfare Department, said, ``He was the best everything. He was
the best father, the best husband, the best lawyer, the best
partner, the best friend...and he was extraordinarily brave.''
   Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke said, ``The death of Edward Bennett
Williams is a great loss to Baltimore, Washington and the nation.
Mr. Williams was a towering figure in Baltimore as the owner of our
beloved Orioles and even though he did not live here, he proved
time and again his commitment to the city through his involvement
in the local community and more recently signing a long-term lease
to keep the Orioles in Baltimore.''
   Bob Douglas, a spokesman for Maryland Gov. William Donald
Schaefer, read a statement which said in part: ``Although he was
the toughest negotiator I ever encountered, he was always true and
fair in his dealings. And this spring, he kept his promise to never
move the Orioles by signing a long-term lease which commits the
ballclub to Baltimore for the next 15 years.''
   Morris Siegel, a Washington newspaper columunist and friend of
Williams, said from his hospital bed in Atlanta, Ga., ``It is
really sad _ even when you know it is coming.''
   Duke Zeibert, owner of a downtown Washington restaurant where
Williams often had lunch, said ``If ever there was a fighter, he
was it. He would never give up.''
   ``I loved this guy, he was just amazing. Just being around him
you learned things, he was just a wonderful human being,'' Zeibert
said. ``There ain't too many like him.''
   Williams enchanted juries, befuddled prosecutors, defended
pariahs and befriended the mighty. Inside the courtroom, he beat
the best the government could offer; outside of it he gave his best
to government, performing a variety of tough legal missions abroad
and advisory roles at home.
   In one of his last high-profile cases, Williams defended
millionaire industrialist Victor Posner, who eventually pleaded no
contest last Sept. 29 to evading more than $1.2 million in federal
taxes by inflating the value of land he donated to a bible college
as a tax exemption.
   Sentencing was delayed twice last December after Williams
telephoned the judge to say he was to undergo surgery in Washington.
   Williams' customers also included the Democratic National
Committee _ he served two years as the party's treasurer _ and The
Washington Post, the Ford Motor Co., and Gulf & Western as well as
gangster Frank Costello, CIA director Richard Helms, Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy and Bobby Baker, an aide to Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson.
   By his own account, Williams personally lost only one ``major''
case, the 1967 fraud and income tax evasion trial of Bobby Baker,
an aide to Lyndon B. Johnson. Williams went home with him, Baker
said, and burst into tears.
   He couldn't stand losing outside the courtroom, either. As
president of the Redskins, he spent to get the best, first hiring
the legendary Vince Lombardi (``Winning isn't everything, it's the
only thing'') as coach, and then, after Lombardi's death, George
Allen.
   When Jack Kent Cooke bought out his share _ and virtual control
_ of the football team, Williams already had acquired another toy,
baseball's Orioles in nearby Baltimore. The team won the 1983 World
Series with manager Joe Altobelli, but when it began to slump in
1985, Williams promptly dumped him and lured another coaching
legend, Earl Weaver, out of retirement.
   As it turned out, even Weaver couldn't rejuvenate the Orioles'
pitching, and he retired again after the 1986 season.
   Cal Ripken Sr., the 1987 manager, got the ax after the Orioles
dropped six consecutive games to open the 1988 season. He then
hired Frank Robinson to now avail - they lost another 15 straight.
   Despite his deteriorating health, Williams remained in active
control of the Orioles until late May, when he turned over
day-to-day operations to law partner Lawrence Lucchino.
   Williams, born May 31, 1920, was the only child of a floorwalker
in a Hartford, Conn., department store. When his father was laid
off during the Depression, he all but abandoned his hopes of going
to college, but the vice principal of his high school got him a
scholarship at Holy Cross, the rigidly disciplined Jesuit college
at Worcester, Mass.
   He joined the Army Air Force in World War II, but was soon
injured in the crash of a training plane _ everyone else aboard was
killed _ and was discharged. He enrolled at the Georgetown
University Law School in Washington.
   Even before he passed the bar, Hogan & Hartson, then the
capital's second-largest law firm, hired him on Georgetown's
recommendation.
   After marrying his boss's daughter, Dorothy Adair, Williams hung
out his own shingle. She died, at age 34, of a respiratory illness,
and Williams married Agnes Neill, then a top lawyer in his own
firm, a year later. He had three children by his first marriage,
four by the second.

   Thousands of mourners paid homage to
three-time President Oscar Arnulfo Arias Madrid on Saturday as his
body was brought back to Panama from Miami, where he had been
living in exile.
   The Harvard-educated physician, overthrown by the military in
each of his presidencies, died of a heart attack Wednesday in
Miami. He was 86.
   Mourners lined the 15-mile route of the funeral cortege from the
airport to Panama City's Metropolitan Cathedra.
   Some people shouted, ``Mr. President, your people are present,''
and ``Arnulfo, Panama cries for you'' as the hearse and hundreds of
other vehicles in the procession passed by.
   Arias founded the Authentic Panamanian Party and was elected to
three, four-year presidential terms beginning in 1940. But he was
ousted in 1941, then was re-elected and served for 18 months in
1949-1951 and only 11 days in 1968.
   He ran again for the presidency in 1984 but lost to a military
candidate in elections the opposition said were fraudulent.
   A nationalist and anti-communist, Arias backed legislation that
gave women the vote and created Panama's social security system
during his terms in office.
   He went into self-imposed exile in Miami in December. Arias was
a critic of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the head of Panama's
Defense Forces and power behind the civilian governnment but he did
not actively participate in opposition efforts to force Noriega to
resign.
   Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Florda last
February on drug trafficking charges and the United States has
imposed economic sanctions on Panama as Noriega has refused to step
down.
   Arias' body will lie in state at the Roman Catholic cathedral
until Monday when burial services will be at the Garden of Peace
cemetery. Arias would have been 87 Monday.

<HEAD>Studies Indicate Fungus Causes AIDS Patients' Pneumonia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The form of pneumonia that kills many
people with AIDS is caused by a fungus, not by microscopic animals
called protozoa as many have assumed, new studies indicate.
   The discovery that pneumocystis pneumonia apparently is caused
by a fungus could help scientists develop more effective drugs for
treating the lung ailment, said Dr. Jeffrey C. Edman, a researcher
at the University of California at San Francisco.
   Though the pneumocystis organism was discovered in the early
1900s, scientists have not known whether it is caused by a fungus,
which is a plant form, or a protozoan, which like a single-cell
microbe is in the most primitive class of animals.
   Drugs that rely on anti-protozoan agents are being used
effectively for treating pneumocystis. But the medications, such as
Pentamidine and Bactrim, are often accompanied by side effects.
   ``This finding will allow us to research new areas of the
cellular processes that are more classically associated with fungi
and use those as guidelines for new drugs,'' said Edman.
   Edman said his team's findings, reported in the current issue of
the British journal Nature, also suggest that pneumocystis is
acquired not from other people but from the environment. Such a
finding could help doctors protect those infected with the acquired
immune deficiency virus from getting pneumocystis.
   ``It is not known how pneumocystis transmission occurs. But it's
possible that as a fungus that it may be transmitted from somewhere
in the environment, that it may be growing somewhere we are not
able to identify,'' said Edman.
   A protozoan would likely be spread through human-to-animal
contact or by an insect, while fungi are transmitted in the
physical environment, such as in the soil.
   A story in Sunday's editions of The New York Times cited other
doctors' similar findings and quoted outside experts as agreeing
that the findings were important for treatment of AIDS.
   Dr. Donald Armstrong, an expert in fungal diseases at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York said evidence that the
organism is a fungus will provide an impetus for scientists to
renew their efforts to ``learn how we might grow it,'' to ease
testing of drugs.

   Diana Lewis works for the Police Department, but
her truck has been forced into a life of crime.
   Her silver 1979 truck was stolen in early July and again this
week from the same bus parking lot. Both times, police say, the
truck was apparently used as a getaway vehicle by the same man to
rob two banks.
   Enough's enough, says Ms. Lewis, who has transferred to a new
police job and won't park her truck in the lot any more.
   ``The odds of becoming a victim around here seem to be getting
smaller,'' said Ms. Lewis, a civilian employee for the detective
bureau and a part-time reserve officer.
   Ms. Lewis found the abandoned truck herself after it was used in
a July 6 robbery. Officers found it a few hours after it was used
in a bank robbery Wednesday.
   If the last robbery wasn't enough, it also got a paint job. A
dye package planted in the stolen cash exploded inside the truck's
cab, painting it red.

   A man who confessed to two killings
because he believed the statute of limitations had run out
committed suicide hours after he was convicted of murder.
   George L. Bonner, 58, hanged himself in his Lake County Jail
cell shortly before 5 a.m. Thursday, said County Police Chief James
Reyome and Coroner Daniel D. Thomas.
   Reyome said Bonner, who faced a maximum penalty of 150 years in
jail, wrote a suicide note indicating he did not want to serve any
more time behind bars.
   Superior Court Judge Richard J. Conroy had to tell jurors about
the suicide early Thursday when they returned to decide whether
Bonner was a habitual criminal, so they could recommend a sentence.
``It was very difficult for them and me,'' Conroy said.
   Public defender Kevin Relphorde said he and jurors re-examined
the case afterward. ``Jurors asked me why (Bonner) didn't take the
witness stand. He wanted to do it, but I advised him not to. I
wonder if there are other things I could have done,'' Relphorde
said.
   Jurors convicted Bonner of killing Eunice Souters, 67, and
Othell Crenshaw, 49, on April 28, 1979, in the victims' apartment.
   The crime had remained unsolved until last year when Gary police
Sgt. William Hlas arrested Bonner in an unrelated crime.
   Relphorde said Hlas told jurors Bonner confessed to the killings
thinking he could no longer be prosecuted because too much time had
elapsed. He didn't realize there is no statute of limitations for
murder.

<HEAD>Refugee Agency Reserves Judgment On `Boat People' Episode</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.N. refugee agency will reserve judgment on
reports of cannibalism among a boatload of Vietnamese refugees
until Philippine authorities complete their inquiry, a spokesman
said Friday.
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, head of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees bureau for Asia and Oceania bureau, told The Associated
Press he did not know how long the inquiry will take.
   Vietnamese `boat people' have international refugee status and
come under the agency's protection, which can be withdrawn if
refugees commit crimes.
   The captain of the USS Dubuque was temporarily relieved of his
duties this week pending an investigation of charges that his ship
did not adequately assist the refugees when it encountered them in
the South China Sea.
   The Navy is helping investigate reports of murder and
cannibalism that appeared this week in a Manila newspaper. The
Vietnamese eventually were rescued near the Philippines and are in
a refugee camp there.
   Survivors were quoted survivors as saying they killed and ate
some of their fellow passengers to stay alive after they
encountered the Dubuque on June 9. Two victims reportedly died of
starvation, but three others allegedly were murdered through
drowning and then eaten.
   Some survivors said the Dubuque refused to take them aboard even
though their boat was disabled and they were dying of exposure and
starvation. The ship's crew them food and water.
   Robert Cooper, the U.N. refugee agency's Manila representative,
said 52 refugees survived 37 days at sea but 58 people died. The
refugees set out from the Mekong Delta town of Ben Tre on May 22
aboard a 35-foot wooden boat. Its engine failed two or three days
later.
   Navy regulations say warships may pick up refugees on the high
seas if the vessel is judged unseaworthy, bad weather is
approaching or there are ``other special circumstances.''

   Soybean price support loan rates for the 1988
crop will be $4.77 per bushel, unchanged from last year, although a
final decision will be made by Oct. 1, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng announced Friday.
   The loan rate for 1988 soybeans is far below current market
prices of more than $8 per bushel. Prices rose sharply this summer
as drought and hot weather reduced harvest prospects.
   On Thursday, USDA estimated this fall's soybean harvest at 1.47
billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1987.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NATO alliance said Friday it is
committed to sharing of the costs of Western defense equitably and
to maintaining a fair partnership among the 16 member nations.
   It released the statement a day after the U.S. Senate approved a
$282.6 billion military spending bill including an amendment that
suggests Western Europe and Japan do more for their own defense.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization statement said equitable
sharing of defense responsibilities ``concerns each ally as it is
in the interest of all that a distribution is balanced.''
   ``There is within the alliance continuing commitment to this
principle, as well as recognition of the need to renew efforts to
maintain, under evolving circumstances, a fair partnership,'' it
said.
   There has been a growing effort in the U.S. Congress to press
Western European countries to allocate more money for defense.
Congress has asked for a report by the end of this year on U.S.
consultations with its allies on ``burden sharing.''
   The NATO statement said defense ministers have ``expressed their
determination to improve collective defense and to ensure that each
ally contributes in the most effective and equitable fashion.''
   A European diplomat at NATO headquarters expressed concern that
the Senate measure might lead to a reduction in the U.S. commitment
to Western Europe and weaken the bargaining position at East-West
negotiations in Vienna on reduction of conventional military forces
in Europe.
   ``If we start reducing unilaterally then there is no point in
the Russians giving in to Western pressure, because there is no
pressure,'' said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Senate amendment orders a major review of U.S. overseas
commitments and limits the deployment of American troops in Japan
and South Korea. It also sets a limit on spending for U.S. military
personnel stationed overseas, requiring the allies to pay the
difference if deployment costs surpass 1988 levels.
   A House version of the spending bill, approved two months ago,
has no burden-sharing amendment. The measures now go to a
House-Senate conference committee.
   Cost sharing has been a frequent topic since NATO was formed in
1949 and there have been calls in Congress in recent years to
withdraw some of the 330,000 American military personnel in Europe.
   NATO figures show the proportional of defense spending by
alliance members varies widely. Last year the United States
budgeted 6.6 percent of its gross domestic product on defense while
Luxembourg provided 1.2 percent.
   Britain earmarked 4.9 percent in 1987, France 4 percent, Germany
3 percent, and Canada 2.1 percent, according to the figures.

   The Food and Drug Administration alerted
consumers Friday to check any bottles of a prescription allergy and
cold medicine syrup called Promethazine VC Plain to make sure it
does not contain a thick, white lotion instead of the normal clear,
orange-yellow syrup.
   The agency said the white lotion may be lindane, a medicine for
parasitic mites known as scabies. Lindane could cause severe
convulsions if taken by children, the FDA said.
   The FDA said pint bottles of My-K and Rugby brands of
Promethazine VC Plain syrup made by My-K Laboratories, lot 15880,
were being recalled from pharmacies.
   Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Morton Grove, Ill., which recently
purchased My-K Laboratories, began the recall after a pint bottle
of the lindane lotion mislabeled as promethazine syrup was found by
a pharmacist in Racine, Wis.
   The FDA asked consumers to watch for the white lotion because
the bottles they purchase from drug stores may not have the lot
number or distributor's name.
   It noted that some pharmacists may have transferred the product
to smaller bottles.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, who has pressed for
ethics investigations of House Speaker Jim Wright, called on the
House ethics panel Friday to look into three additional Wright
matters and also into issues involving other House members.
   Gingrich, R-Ga., based his allegations on information that has
surfaced over the past several months through court action and
testimony regarding Congress members, news stories, and allegations
by the lobbying group Common Cause. In two cases he called for
reopening of cases that the House ethics committee has already
investigated and closed.
   Those two involved investments and links to the business
community by Rep. Fernand St Germain, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, and the case of Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, who the
ethics committee said violated House rules in payments made to two
staff members. No disciplinary action was taken in her case.
   The ethics panel in April closed the St Germain case, saying he
did not abuse his office for personal gain but did understate the
value of his assets in his personal financial forms. No punishment
was recommended.
   Gingrich criticized the committee's decisions in those two cases
and said they should be reopened in light of stricter standards the
committee now appears to be using.
   ``The fact is the House of Representatives is increasingly
invulnerable to public policing. Members can do virtually anything
and survive,'' Gingrich said at a news conference the week before
the Republican National Convention.
   The Democratic-controlled House, according to Gingrich, is run
by ``a corrupt House machine.''
   Aides to Wright did not return a call for comment Friday.
   Regarding Wright, Gingrich said the House panel should look into
the sale of gemstones through a company in which Wright has an
interest but whose underlying holdings he has not disclosed in his
financial statements; and the purchase of a computer system for his
Washington office from a supporter whose company was not on a
House-approved list of vendors.
   The speaker's office has said the computer was purchased after
aides did not find the one they wanted on the approved list, and
that the system was installed for demonstration purposes with a
goal of being eventually approved by the House Administration
Committee for use in other House offices.
   Also regarding Wright, a Texan, Gingrich said the ethics panel
should look into the relationship between the ``savings and loan
scandal, indicted millionaire investors,'' a political action
committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.''
   The ethics committee already is investigating Wright for six
allegations of misconduct.
   They include a deal in which he earned about $55,000 in sales of
a book that was published by a friend who had done work for his
campaigns; two cases involving allegations of possible lobbying on
behalf of oil companies in which he may have had an interest;
allegations of pressuring federal officials on behalf of Texas
bankers; and allegations of using a condominium as his Fort Worth
home while paying only a per diem and expenses but no monthly rent.

<HEAD>Sara Lee Corp. To Pay $725,000 for Illegally Aiding Israeli
Boycott</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sara Lee Corp. has agreed to pay a $725,000
civil penalty to settle charges that it violated federal laws by
aiding the Arab boycott of Israel, the government said Friday.
   G. Philip Hughes, assistant secretary of commerce for export
enforcement, said an order signed Friday requires the food and
clothing manufacturer to pay the penalty within 20 days.
   Hughes said it was the second-largest anti-boycott penalty ever
collected. On March 22, Safeway Stores Inc. of Oakland, Calif.,
agreed to pay $995,000 to settle charges stemming from its
operation of markets in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   Sara Lee agreed to the payment, without admitting or denying
guilt, shortly before the scheduled Aug. 1 start of a trial before
an administrative law judge.
   Following a three-year investigation, the department charged
Sara Lee on Nov. 19 with 235 violations carrying a maximum possible
penalty of $2.35 million.
   The department said Sara Lee, in connection with an attempt to
register trademarks in Kuwait, furnished information about the
names and nationalities of members of its board of directors and
the names and places of incorporation of U.S. and foreign
subsidiaries.
   Such information is used by Arab League countries to make
blacklist decisions in its boycott of Israel, the department said.
   An employee answering the telephone at Sara Lee offices in
Chicago said company officials would not be available for comment
until Monday.

   A parliamentary investigating
committee controlled by the opposition voted Friday to subpoena
former President Choi Kyu-hah to testify about the bloody civil
uprising in Kwangju in 1980.
   The opposition intends to prove that another former president,
Chun Doo-hwan, played a role in the military suppression of the
uprising in which about 200 people died.
   The current president, Roh Tae-woo, is linked to Chun. Roh was
one of the generals who helped Chun take control when Choi resigned
in 1980.
   After seven hours of heated debate, the committee voted, 15-0,
to summon Choi. Twelve committee members from the governing
Democratic Justice Party boycotted the vote and an independent
member was absent.
   Choi served as president for 10 months after President Park
Chung-hee was assassinated in October 1979. The Kwangju rebellion
took place while Choi was president in May 1980.
   The opposition hopes eventually to bring Chun before two
parliamentary committees. It wants to look into Chun's role not
only at Kwangju but in financial and other scandals involving his
seven-year presidency.
   Chun left office in February and was succeeded by Roh, who was
voted into the presidency over a divided opposition.
   A brother of Chun, Chun Kyung-hwan, is now on trial on charges
of embezzeling millions of dollars in official funds.

   The Israeli Embassy gave travel
documents Friday to a Jewish couple who left the Soviet Union in a
20-foot sailboat, with the Kremlin's blessing, and docked in Sweden
on their way to Israel.
   Alexander Berman and his wife Luba Padas said they were the
first people allowed by Soviet authorities to emigrate in a boat.
Private ownership of a vessel is uncommon in the Soviet Union.
   ``We sold everything we owned and borrowed the rest from
friends'' to buy the boat, Berman, 51, said through an interpreter.
He said they paid 6,130 rubles (about $9,800) for it a year ago.
   Berman has written books about traveling in the Soviet Arctic
and his 33-year-old wife, a musician, has gone on sailing and
mountain-climbing expeditions.
   He said he had not been involved in Zionist activities and
encountered no problems in obtaining an emigration visa, with the
process taking three months.
   ``I know refuseniks have had a difficult time, but others have
had a very easy time'' in getting permission to leave, he said.
``For us it was very easy.''
   Refusenik refers mainly to Soviet Jews but also to other Soviet
citizens whose applications for exit visas are refused by the
government.
   After a four-day, 180-mile voyage from Riga, Latvia, the couple
landed on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea on
Tuesday.
   Berman said his greatest fear was that storms would blow his
small craft back to the Soviet Union where they were barred from
landing after relinquishing their Soviet citizenship.

<DATELINE>DUESSELDORF, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scandal involving the illegal
use of growth-enhancing hormones on calves in North
Rhine-Westphalia state has become a national problem.
   Klaus Matthiesen, agriculture minister of North
Rhine-Westphalia, on Friday ordered the confiscation of
15,000-20,000 calves belonging to a single company.
   He did not identify the owner of the animals but said the North
Rhine-Westphalia firm had calves in several parts of the country.
   Matthiesen said it is believed the company treated the calves
with the hormone testosterone in an attempt to increase veal
production.
   West German law forbids the use of testosterone in raising
cattle. Some scientists have said the hormone is a suspected
cancer-causing agent, but West German scientists said the amounts
of testosterone found in the calves posed no danger to humans.
   In Baden-Wuerttemberg state, the agriculture ministry reported
calves treated with illegal hormones had been discovered there and
several cattle raisers were under investigation. It said 300 calves
were immediately taken off the market.
   Earlier this week, North Rhine-Westphalia officials accused
cattle-raiser Felix Hying of using hormones on thousands of calves.
   They ordered the slaughter of 4,200 of Hying's calves that
tested positive for the hormone and said more than 10,000 others
more were being tested.
   Werner Chory of the federal Health Ministry said: ``Firm
punishment must be handed out to those responsible. We are of the
opinion that there must be quick and comprehensive investigations
of every suspected illegal use of hormones.''

   About 5,000 Serbs rallied Friday
in support of Slobodan Milosevic, the hard-line leader of the
Serbian Communist Party, in his drive to strengthen the unity of
Yugoslavia's largest constituent republic.
   The gathering was held near the border of Serbia's autonomous
province of Vojvodina. Milosevic recently accused Vojvodina's
leaders of hampering efforts to amend the Serbian constitution to
give Serbia greater control over its two autonomous provinces.
   Vojvodina and the troubled southern province of Kosovo, though
formally parts of Serbia, were given broad administrative autonomy
under the 1974 constitution adopted while the late Josip Broz Tito
was president.
   Serbia's leaders want to reduce that autonomy in hopes of
curtailing ethnic strife in Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian
majority is said to be terrorizing the Serbian minority and forcing
a Serbian exodus from the province.
   ``We don't want divisions!,'' ``A unified Serbia!,'' ``We don't
give them Kosovo!,'' chanted the demonstrators, many of whom turned
out in traditional Serbian national dress.
   It was the third such demonstration in the area since July 9.
All of them were widely believed to have been orchestrated by
Milosevic himself in an effort to demonstrate popular support for
his policies.
   Nova Pazova, a farming community, lies less than 15 miles west
of Belgrade in Yugoslavia's breadbasket region.
   Earlier demonstrations led to public accusations by the
Vojvodina Communist leadership that Milosevic was using unethical
pressure tactics to achieve his goal of a unified Serbia.
   Speaker after speaker at Friday's meeting assailed the
leadership in both Vojvodina and Kosovo, calling the leaders
``cheap opportunists'' who were unwilling to sacrifice personal
privilege for unity of the republic.

   Security forces in this British colony staged a
counterterrorism exercise Friday in preparation for a Sept. 6
inquest to be held here into the shooting deaths of three unarmed
members of the IRA by British soldiers.
   In London, a TV news broadcast reported Friday that Gibraltar
police wanted to question a suspected IRA guerrilla held in Dublin.
It said they long believed a fourth guerrilla was involved in
purported plans to bomb a British military guard.
   The Independent Television News program identified the suspect
as Peter Rooney, charged in Dublin's High Court with membership in
the illegal Irish Republican Army. Bail was set at $17,100, but
Rooney was ordered confined to jail while the identities of those
posting bail were checked. The news report did not give the source
of its information and could not be independently confirmed
immediately.
   In Gibraltar, Col. P. Fisbourne, chief of staff to Gov. Sir
Peter Terry, said ``Operation Clamp'' was carried out by the
280-man Gibraltar Police Force and British military police in
accordance with measures introduced into the colony since the IRA
attack on March 6.
   The 1{-hour exercise took place near the Rock Hotel where the
mock terrorist attack would have occurred, and it was designed to
test the ability of security forces to seal off all exits from the
2{-square mile limestone rock, according to a statement from
Fishbourne's office.
   On March 6, members of the British Special Air Services shot and
killed Mairead Farrell, Sean Savage and Daniel McCann as they were
walking toward the gate that separates Gibraltar from mainland
Spain.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told Parliament in
London two days later the three were believed to have planted a car
bomb set to go off two days later near Gibraltar's main square at
the time of a ceremonial changing of the guard.
   Howe later said the three were unarmed and the car did not
contain explosives.
   The IRA, which seeks to drive the British out of Northern
Ireland, said the three had been ``on active service'' at the time
of their deaths.
   At a preliminary hearing July 5, Coroner Felix Pizzarello ruled
the seven Special Air Services members involved in the shooting
must be visible to the jury when they testify at the inquest,
although they will be screened from the public and the press.
   An attorney for the Crown and the Gibraltar Police Force, which
is under the direct control of the colony's British governor,
wanted the identities of the seven hidden to protect them and their
families from revenge attacks.
   The purpose of the inquest is to determine whether the shootings
constitute a crime.
   The Gibraltar attorney general has the power to return
indictments if the inquest or his indepedent investigation
determines a crime was committed.

   Bathers have been banned from the central

the Black Sea coast, the Bulgarian state news agency BTA reported
Friday.
   It said the ban was imposed on Wednesday and would be in effect
for three more days for clean-up operations.
   BTA said tons of petrochemicals were washed ashore near Burgas,
affecting a stretch of beach about 2,000 feet long.
   The pollution was assumed to have originated from ships off the
port of Burgas.
   BTA said experts from the sea water pollution control agency
took samples and were trying to locate the origin of the slick.

   Claiming mental anguish and loss of
business, a tavern owner has countersued the parents of five of the
victims of the fiery church bus crash near here that killed 27
people.
   Joann Osborne of Tubby's Tavern filed responses, including the
countersuits, to five of 65 lawsuits filed against her in Carroll
Circuit Court. She denied that her employees negligently allowed
Larry W. Mahoney to become intoxicated May 14, the date of the
wreck.
   Her lawyer, William Carter, has not yet filed responses to the
other 60 lawsuits, court officials said. There was no answer Friday
afternoon at Carter's office.
   Mahoney has pleaded innocent to charges of murder, assault,
wanton endangerment and drunken driving. His trial is scheduled for
January.
   Mrs. Osborne declined comment on the countersuits. She has said
that Mahoney came to her tavern just outside Carrollton between 3
and 3:30 p.m. May 14, about eight hours before the crash. She said
he drank one beer and left but was not drunk.
   Police say Mahoney's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the
legal limit and he was traveling the wrong way on southbound
Interstate 71 when his pickup truck crashed into the bus from the
First Assembly of God Church in Radcliff. Twenty-four of the 27
victims were children.

   The suit was filed by a black lawyers' group, the Thurgood

   The black teen-ager was followed and then stopped by police in
front of his house Wednesday, but was not charged with any offense,
the suit said.
   The suit claims Wade was ``a victim of a policy which was
patently offensive on its face and lacked any constitutional
guarantees of protection from undue police harassment, interference
of invasion of privacy, freedom of association and to be free from
undue and illegal search and seizure.''
   U.S. District Judge John Potter set a Monday hearing on the
suit, which names as defendants Police Chief Martin Felker, Mayor
Donna Owens, City Manager Philip Hawkey and the city of Toledo.
   City officials did not immediately answer telephone messages
seeking comment. However, Felker has defended the policy as
necessary to stop violence in the neighborhood; Ms. Owens and
Hawkey also have supported it.
   The suit seeks a temporary restraining order to keep officers
from carrying out Felker's July 8 directive, which calls for random
stopping of black teen-agers in the Old West End neighborhood. The
order followed complaints by residents who had reported three
violent incidents involving black youngsters.
   Wade's lawyers also seek $1 million in punitive and compensatory
damages.
   The suit contends the city's policy violates federal civil
rights law and the first and fourth amendments to the Constitution,
which provide for freedom of association and freedom from unlawful
search and seizure.
   About 17 percent of Toledo's 340,000 residents are black, and
the city has experienced racial friction recently.
   The Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, which includes
ministers from a variety of church congregations here, recently
asked the Justice Department to investigate what the ministers
called a conspiracy against black officials in Toledo.
   The group contends that local media and officials have conspired
to treat blacks differently from whites _ most notably, by firing
one city employee and disciplining two others for alleged
mismanagement of city housing programs.
   A civil rights group also has been threatening to boycott
businesses that do not hire and promote blacks as a way of ending
what it calls economic injustice in Toledo.

   A gunman stole more than $1 million in stocks
and securities from an 81-year-old man after pushing his way into
the man's apartment and forcing him to open a safe.
   Samuel Rover was left bound and gagged by the robber Wednesday
afternoon and wasn't found until a painter who had come to do his
apartment found him Thursday morning, said Sgt. John Venetucci, a
police spokesman.
   Rover was not injured, he said.
   Rover said he was opening his door when the man forced his way
into the apartment.
   ``The guy took all the stocks ($700,000) and Treasury bills
($525,000) in the safe,'' Rover said Thursday. ``Then he tied me
up. It's a good thing the painter came or I would have been a dead

   He said the robber also took $7,000 in jewelry and some cash.
   Detectives said Rover may be able to recoup on the stocks and
Treasury bills.
   Asked why he did not keep his valuables in the bank, Rover said,
``I have other money in the bank.''

   A Virginia team won a national
competition among high school students with a prize of a $1 million
supercomputer, it was announced Friday.
   The nine-month competition was sponsored by ETA Systems Inc.,
the supercomputer division of Control Data Corp. A team from Thomas
Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria,
Va., was named the winner at an awards ceremony.
   Sixteen students from four high schools spent seven weeks this
summer doing research as part of the competition on the ETA10-P,
which is similar to the one to be awarded to Thomas Jefferson High
School.
   The school will also receive two years of operating costs for
the computer, worth $7,000 to $10,000 a month, and a company
employee to advise on the machine's use.
   The computer is one of the fastest and most powerful available
for scientific engineering and computation. It will be installed in
time for the fall semester, and ETA officials said it will make
Thomas Jefferson the first secondary school in the world with a
supercomputer.
   The teen-age competitors worked on individual projects but were
judged together in teams representing their high schools. The
schools will each get a $3,000 stipend for taking part in the
``SuperQuest'' contest.
   The runners-up were teams from Montgomery Blair High School,
Silver Spring, Md.; North Florida Christian School, Tallahassee,
Fla.; and James Logan High School, Union City, Calif.
   Each of the runner-up high schools will receive a $50,000
Control Data Corp. Cyber 910 graphics work station.
   The contest was the brainchild of ETA's president, Carl
Ledbetter, who said he hopes it will encourage Americans to focus
more attention on math and science education.

   President Jose Sarney named new

   The three resigned after Sarney criticized a proposed new

   Sarney's remarks were seen as an affront to Ulysses Guimaraes,
House speaker and a representative in the legislature, and his
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party. Guimaraes had overseen work on
the new constitution, and the outgoing ministers were allied with
him.
   The new appointees are Rep. Ralph Biasi of Sao Paulo state as
Science and Technology minister, Rep. Leopoldo Bessone of Minas

Jose Aparecido as Culture minister.

<HEAD>Bottle-Fed Babies May Be At Higher Risk Of Cancer, Study Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babies who are bottle-fed appear more likely to
develop cancer than those who are breast-fed, according to findings
published in The Lancet medical journal.
   The report, published in the Aug. 13 issue and made available
Friday, found that children who were artificially fed or were
breast-fed for less than six months were almost twice as much at
risk of developing cancer before age 15 than those who were
breast-fed for more than six months.
   The researchers' determination of a statistical association
between breast feeding and cancer does not prove that lack of
breast feeding is a cause of cancer.
   The report by researchers Margarett K. Davis, David A. Savitz
and Barry I. Graubard was based on a study of 201 Denver children
who developed cancer between 18 months and 15 years of age.
   The researchers, of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development in Bethesda, Md., and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, N.C., studied how these children were fed
as babies compared with how 181 healthy children were fed.
   The researchers found ``a positive association'' between
artificial feeding and childhood cancer, the report said.
   It said, however, that knowledge about childhood cancer is
incomplete and that other variables not examined in the study may
explain the association between artificial feeding and cancer.
   It reported a possible ``source of bias'' from the parents'
inaccurate recall of breast-feeding duration after many years.
   Artificial feeding could deprive infants of ``significant
immunological benefits'' which may weaken their natural defenses
against some forms of cancer, the report said.
   Human milk probably has anti-microbial benefits, it said.
   ``If human milk increases resistance to infection in infancy,
artificial feeding, which provides no immunological benefits, may
alter the child's responses to early infection.
   ``The interaction of the developing immune system and infectious
agents may be critical to the individual's subsequent immune
response to infection or reactivation of latent viral infections,''
the report said.
   It said the cancer most strongly associated with artificial
feeding in the study is lymphoma.
   The type of feeding also can affect other conditions later in
life, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease, the report said.
   The researchers said their results differed from those of
another study, by P.A. McKinney and associates, who found no
association between breast feeding and childhood leukemia and
lymphoma.
   The authors of the new report said their analysis of the
duration of breast feeding was different and might account for the
discrepancy in the results.

<TEXT>
   There's no proof anything like the Lee
County Lizard Man really exists, but a man who says he shot it
faces up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine for unlawfully
carrying a pistol, the sheriff said Friday.
   Lizard Man mania has swept Bishopville since a 17-year-old
reported being chased by a large green, red-eyed creature.
   Sheriff Liston Truesdale said Kenneth Orr, 26, of Florence
admitted he concocted a story about shooting Lizard Man ``because
he wanted to keep the legend of the Lizard Man alive.''
   Orr, an airman at Sumter's Shaw Air Force Base, turned himself
in about 10 a.m. Friday and was charged with unlawfully carrying a
pistol, Truesdale said. Orr later was released on his own
recognizance until his court date.
   ``He said he was real sorry he caused all that trouble,''
Truesdale said. ``He didn't know he was going to do all that.''
   Truesdale said he will decide within the week whether to charge
Orr on the misdemeanor charge of making a false incident report.
   Orr was carrying a .357-caliber Magnum revolver in his car Aug.
5 when he claimed to have shot five times at a creature along U.S.
15, authorities said.
   He told deputies he was on his way to the base when a
5-foot-6-inch lizardlike creature ran across the highway and ``made
a loop'' toward his car. Orr said he fired two warning shots before
shooting three times at the creature, striking it in the neck once.
   State law allows a person to carry a gun in a glove compartment
or trunk of a car without a permit. The law also allows armed
forces members to carry weapons when on duty.
   Truesdale said that Orr's gun was lying on the passenger seat of
his car and that he had no permit.
   Despite the Orr hoax, Truesdale said he is not ready to write
the entire story of the Lizard Man off as fiction.
   ``Those people are seeing something out there,'' he said. ``Now
what it is, I don't know.''

   A former soldier who unveiled a conspiracy
to import cocaine from a U.S. military post office in Panama
pleaded guilty Friday in the case, and trial was set for next month
for nine other defendants.
   Jackie Lee Bigelow, 27, pleaded guilty before U.S. District
Judge J. Robert Elliott to charges of conspiring to possess cocaine
with intent to distribute.
   Bigelow agreed to cooperate with authorities after a traffic
stop in Moultrie last May led to the discovery of 8.5 kilograms of
cocaine in his car trunk. Nine other people have been indicted in
the case, including three unidentified individuals from Panama,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Deborah Fowler.
   Elliott scheduled a trial for the remaining defendants for Sept.
12. Bigelow is to be sentenced following completion of a
presentence report.
   The cocaine conspiracy scheme came to light shortly after
Bigelow's arrest in May, said Colquitt County Sheriff Gene Beard.
After Bigelow agreed to cooperate with investigators, other arrests
followed as well as the seizure of two packages of cocaine _ one
weighing 18 pounds and one 24 pounds _ that had been mailed to
three Georgia women from the military post office in Panama.
   An FBI affidavit released in June said Bigelow admitted he had
traveled to Panama twice this year to meet with others in the
cocaine conspiracy to set up shipments. Bigelow served in Panama
while in the Army.
   In court Thursday, Ms. Fowler said the conspiracy had brought in
163 kilograms of cocaine from February 1987 until June 1988.
   Also Thursday, Elliott refused to set bond for Gary King, age
unavailable, of Doe Run, another former U.S. Army soldier charged
in the case. None of the other defendants has been released on bond.
   The Army has said it is continuing investigations into
allegations of drug trafficking from U.S. military posts in Panama
and elsewhere.

   One in seven Vietnam veterans suffers from
post-traumatic stress disorder, a rate seven times that estimated

   The 15 percent rate cited in the latest study translates to
about 470,000 cases.
   The discrepancy with the 2.2 percent rate reported earlier by

differences in the criteria for diagnosis.
   In contrast to a single yardstick used in the CDC study, the new
estimate relied on several measures, said researcher William

Attorney Rudolph Giuliani is investigating whether police violated
the civilians' civil rights.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch and Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward
initially defended police, but reversed field after watching
videotapes of officers swinging billy clubs with abandon, covering
their badge numbers and trampling people with their horses.
   Koch also lifted the curfew and ordered the park left open
overnight, although an 11 p.m. noise curfew has been enforced. And
in an effort to reduce police-civilian tensions, citizen observers
are joining officers on patrols.

   Boston is bracing for a decade-long overhaul of
its antiquated highway system and for the headaches that will go
with it, including the possibility of a torrent of rats being
unleashed by the ``big dig.''
   The $4.5 billion project includes a plan to build a third tunnel
under Boston Harbor and transform the Central Artery, Interstate 93
through downtown, from a six-lane elevated highway to an eight- to
10-lane underground expressway.
   Experts say that without the new design, 14-hour gridlocks could
someday develop. Construction officials promise a new, grander
Boston will emerge from the rubble and disarray that will begin
affecting motorists later this year.

   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon is still giving security-cleared
industry representatives access over the table to classified
documents for bidding on sensitive projects despite allegations of
bribes to get secret information.
   Responding to an inquiry by The Associated Press, the Defense
Department said it still has a long-standing policy under which
contractors with a ``valid need to know'' can obtain entire
``descriptive summaries'' of futuristic research and development
projects.
   The open information-sharing system apparently has operated
alongside the clandestine arrangements between consultants and
Pentagon employees that have been the subject of a 2-year-old
federal investigation of contracting abuse.

   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ The people of Africa's last
colony, war-weary and deeply skeptical after 22 years of fighting,
see major obstacles to independence despite South African proposals
to withdraw.
   South Africa joined an Angolan war cease-fire Aug. 8, said it
will pull out of Angola by Sept. 1, and tentatively plans to begin
withdrawing Nov. 1 from neighboring South-West Africa, also known
as Namibia.
   South Africa has offered to grant Namibia independence on June 1
if Cuba agrees to remove its 50,000 troops from Angola by then.
   South Africa, Cuba, Angola and U.S. mediators plan to hold more
talks the week of Aug. 22 in a bid to establish a date for the
Cuban withdrawal and independence for Namibia. Without an
agreement, Namibian independence plans appear headed for another
derailment.

   Putting yourself in the proper frame of mind can
help you beat the heat as much as plugging in the air conditioner,
psychologists say.
   ``It's a time for people to learn to remain cool,'' said Michael
R. Mantell, chief psychologist for the San Diego Police Department.
He was attending the annual meeting of the American Psychological
Association.
   ``Stop telling yourself it's awful. It's just hot,'' Mantell
said. ``At the very worst, it's an inconvenience.''
   ``It is very comforting to think and to realize that it could be
worse,'' he said.
   Though rainfall eased drought conditions in parts of the
Midwest, much of the nation continued to swelter Saturday, and
power consumption and temperature records fell.

<HEAD>Is Economic Growth Peaking?</HEAD>

   Wall Streeters see more and more signs these
days that the nation is at or near the peak of the textbook
economic cycle.
   If their analysis is right, strong growth in the recent stages
of an economic expansion that dates back to 1982 has set in motion
forces that will lead to a slowdown before long.
   Whether that slowdown necessarily has to turn into a recession
is a subject of much debate. Many observers hope a mild setback, or
a ``soft landing,'' would be enough to set the stage for the next
period of sustained growth.
   But others say the circumstances may make a more pronounced
dropoff in business activity hard to avoid over the next year or
two.
   ``Growth should remain solid during the second half of 1988,''
says Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ``But
higher interest rates and a loss of export momentum will take a
toll by next year. Growth could stall out by mid-1989.
   ``A major risk for next year,'' Straszheim says, is ``a
synchronized slowdown in the industrialized countries.''
   Even before the Federal Reserve raised its discount rate last
week from 6 percent to 6.5 percent, Chairman Alan Greenspan had
made his concerns clear about an economy testing the limits of its
capacity and the accompanying potential for increased inflation.
   By raising the discount rate, the Fed seemed to signal that it
was taking a more aggressive approach to restraining growth before
it gets dangerously unsustainable.
   Allen Sinai, economist at the Boston Co. and Economic Advisers
Inc., says the economy is in a ``full employment zone _ where
growth in demands begins to outstrip available supplies as labor
and product markets reach nearly full utilization.''
   ``In the full employment zone, the supplies of labor, productive
capacity and finance tighten, leading to accelerating wage and
price inflation and rising costs of finance,'' Sinai says.
   ``Depending on the source of the economy's strength, the full
employment zone can beget behavior that intensifies demands,
ultimately leading to inflationary and other excesses that only a
major slowdown or recession can arrest.
   ``In the full employment zone,'' Sinai adds, ``interest rates
often rise higher and for a longer period than most expect.''
   Of course, the peak-of-the-cycle view is by no means unanimous.
Some analysts say that with industrial America having just emerged
from a prolonged slump, strong production activity and demand for
new production facilities can help keep the economy on track for
the foreseeable future.
   But should the economy start slowing, it would most likely bring
some benefits and opportunities along with the obvious problems.
   For one thing, it would sooner or later take the pressure off
inflation and interest rates.
   The newsletter Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, in its August
survey of the forecasts of dozens of economists around the country,
says: ``Interest rates are still expected to move somewhat higher
as the Federal Reserve leans against inflationary pressures.
   ``However, the consensus forecast shows rates beginning to top
out by the third quarter of 1989 as economic growth slows, abating
inflationary pressures.''
   As analysts at Wright Investors' Service, a Bridgeport, Conn.,
money management firm, put it:
   ``The Federal Reserve, through its high interest rate policy,
has effectively taken away the punch bowl. Slow economic growth is
likely during the rest of this year and the first half of 1989.''
   However, the firm adds, ``if that is the case, interest rates
are likely to be a good bit lower one year from now.''

<HEAD>Fresh Water Supplies of Gulf Arabs Shrinking, Raising Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NABILA MEGALLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil remains in good supply, but fresh
water is running low in the six Arab nations on the Persian Gulf.
United Nations experts are concerned.
   The Dammam aquifer, running like an umbilical cord under the six
nations, provides an estimated one-third of their overall water.
But with all six states sucking up the water faster than nature can
put it back, the experts predict a future far more arid than it is
now.
   ``Man can live without food for two to three months, but he
would die without water for two to three days,'' said Ahmed Adel
Orabi, deputy director of the regional U.N. Environmental Program,
which is based in Bahrain, a Gulf island.
   ``If extraction continues to exceed recharge, the Dammam aquifer
can dry up within 10 to 50 years,'' he said. ``If well-exploited,
it can last forever.''
   Water resources are a problem throughout the Middle East: riots
broke out in Sudan in July over fluctuations in the water supply;
Libya is expecting to invest $25 billion in an underground river
system; some analysts see a danger of wars in the future over the
area's water resources.
   The Dammam aquifer stretches the length of the western coastline
of the Persian Gulf, from Kuwait in the north through Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
   The reservoir, used mostly for agriculture, is the source of the
artesian wells that allowed oases to flourish along the coast for
hundreds of years.
   But oil wealth brought new demands on the water supply as
economies expanded.
   Saudi Arabia has a daily desalinized water flow of 588 million
gallons for a population of less than 12 million. With its vast oil
reserves, it can afford it.
   But states like Bahrain still have to rely on nature, and
officials here view the depletion of the Dammam aquifer with alarm.
Bahrain gets 50 percent of its water from the underground system.
   ``Water has been stored in the reservoir over millions of years.
... Over the past 10 to 15 years, it is being bled more than can be
compensated,'' said Jamil Al Alawi, Bahrain's assistant
undersecretary for power and water affairs.
   Bahrain's finances, battered by soft oil prices, have enabled it
to build only two desalinization plants. A third, a gift from Saudi
Arabia, has been delayed.
   Desalinization plants make it unlikely that anyone in the area
will go thirsty. But the cost of the refined water is prohibitive
for farm irrigation. This means that water from the aquifer could
be the key to agricultural and economic development.
   ``Desalinization plants complement the reservoir, they are good
for drinking purposes, but it is the reservoir that helps vital
development going,'' said Orabi. ``There can be no food security
without water security.''
   Area leaders call for nationwide prayers when the rains do not
come in the winter, while newspaper and television campaigns skewer
careless users.
   Television programs remind Bahrainis that only 50 years ago
water used to be hauled in from the ``kawkabs'' _ the sweet-water
springs gushing from the sea.
   ``Water is our most precious source of life. When it's gone, so
are we,'' said another TV program.
   This year's rains have been bountiful, so much so that tomato
growers on Bahrain nearly lost their crops.
   But rains are unpredictable.
   The U.N. Environmental Program hopes to come up with a
comprehensive plan within two years for conserving the Damman
aquifer, and an international agreement might have to be worked out
to distribute the water among the six nations.
   The U.N. plan will also suggest alternative irrigation sources,
such as recycling sewer water. It also will seek to re-educate
farmers on cutting the amount of water used on their fields.
   Orabi said it is a false concept that land in desert areas
requires more water for irrigation.
   Al-Alawi estimated that Bahrain's population was growing at the
rate of 5 percent to 10 percent annually, and coupled with a rising
standard of living, water consumption reached a peak of 61 million
gallons a day last year. It is expected to hit 65 million this
summer. Its desalinization plants produce a little over half that.
   Until greater production and conservation redress the situation,
Bahrain would have to pump 30 million gallons a day from the Dammam
aquifer to meet demand.
   Bahrain sits at the edge of the aquifer, and drawing too much
water too fast could allow seawater to seep in, Al-Alawi said. Too
much salinity in artesian wells is irreversible.
   ``This year and the coming years the situation is critical,
(but) I won't call it dangerous,'' he said.

   China, 1988: the Year of the Dragon; the 10th in
the reform years of Deng Xiaoping.
   What is the state of the nation?
   A land of great excess and discouraging want; encumbered by too
many people (more than a billion) with too many expectations
grappling for too few resources with too little money and not
enough opportunity for success.
   Deng, now 84 and semi-retired, says the political, economic and
social reforms he initiated in 1978 have now entered a ``crucial
stage.''
   China must push ahead with price reforms without exacerbating
double-digit inflation. It must produce more goods while reining in
an industrial growth rate of 17 percent, far greater than the
nation's weak infrastructure and limited financial resources can
sustain.
   China must also give its people more democracy without
unleashing the already serious problems of unrest and crime that
accompany a less regimented society.
   For all its dramatic changes of the past decade, China is still
an achingly poor agrarian nation where millions have never ridden
in a car, seen an indoor toilet or traveled beyond the next
mountain.
   The government estimates that 60 million people live below the
poverty line of 150 yuan ($40) per person a year. In the dusty
drylands of north-central China where the late Chairman Mao
Tse-tung built his revolutionary base 50 years ago, 30 million
people still live in caves.
   About 20 percent of Chinese, a number almost equal to the
population of the United States, are illiterate.
   But Deng, thrice-purged by Mao, has transformed the landscape
since a now legendary Communist Party conference in late 1978 when
he consolidated power, rejected the primacy of class struggle and
announced that socialism must be equated with economic development,
not political upheaval and poverty.
   Deng revived the family farm, encouraged free markets and said
private enterprise is crucial to what he calls a ``socialist
commodity economy.'' He has traded off unwieldy central planning
for production according to market demands.
   More recently China has begun experimenting with stock markets,
shareholding, land auctions and private housing. Cities avidly
compete for foreign investment, and already 12,000 companies, led
by those from Hong Kong, the United States and Japan, have invested
nearly $10 billion in joint ventures and wholly owned firms.
   Zhao Ziyang, the new general secretary of the Communist Party,
speaking at a landmark party congress last fall, emphasized that
China will be in the ``primary stage of socialism'' for 100 years.
In effect, he gave economists a century to tinker with capitalistic
business practices.
   During Deng's decade, incomes have more than tripled in the
countryside, to about 450 yuan ($121) annually per person, and
doubled in the cities to about 1,000 yuan ($270).
   One-fourth of urban households now have color TVs and one-tenth
have refrigerators. In 1981 the figure for both was near zero. Only
a third of city residents have indoor plumbing, but a majority own
washing machines and tape recorders.
   China's gross national product in 1987 topped $270 billion, more
than double a decade earlier and up 9.4 percent from 1986. Foreign
trade quadrupled to $80 billion, and 1.7 million foreign tourists
scaled the Great Wall and viewed the wonders of ancient Xian,
compared to 230,000 in 1978.
   The most profound changes have come in the countryside, where 80
percent of China's 1.07 billion people live. Deng dismantled Mao's
initiative-stifling communes and gave the farm back to the family.
The farmer now contracts with the state for a certain amount of
produce, and can sell anything above his quota on the better-paying
free market.
   Deng's assurances that it was no sin to get rich has led to
``10,000-yuan-a-year households,'' inconceivable during Mao's
ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution in 1966-76.
   Despite the successes, ``agriculture problems are crying out for
a solution,'' the daily publication Economic Information has said.
Grain production, after hitting a record 407 million tons in 1984,
fell sharply in 1985 and has yet to fully recover.
   Bad weather is partly to blame, but a key problem is that the
government, while warning that the nation barely produces enough to
feed itself, pays too little for contracted grain. Farmers have
little interest in planting rice when they can earn two or three
times as much growing watermelons for the free market or setting up
a factory on abandoned grain fields.
   Beijing is also talking about the need for mechanized
``optimum-scale'' farms, meaning large-scale production. While no
one advocates bringing back communes, there is growing recognition
that the family farmer, scraping away at his average 1.5 acres with
his water buffalo and hoe, has little room for expanded production.

<HEAD>BEIJING: expanded production.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The most visible evidence of reform in China's cities and towns
today are the 20 million free market entrepreneurs whose stalls of
fresh foods and brightly colored clothes clog streetcorners.
   China also has 3.6 million people working for 225,000 ``private
businesses,'' or entrepreneurs employing eight or more people.
These workers, often hired on fixed contracts, give up ``eating
from the iron pot,'' the lifetime employment system where
performance is irrelevant, for a shot at earning more in a
profit-making company.
   Recent economic reforms have centered on giving factory managers
more autonomy and adjusting prices to reflect market values rather
than arbitrary state-set ceilings. In both areas, progress has been
slow and arduous.
   Under the responsibility system, factory managers are freed from
excess interference from Beijing or local party secretaries. The
manager and his workers are rewarded for making profits and pay the
consequences of losing money.
   In reality, though, the manager still depends on government
indulgences for scarce energy and raw materials, and he often must
sell to the state at unrealistically low prices.
   His right to dismiss redundant or unsatisfactory workers is
rarely used. China, with an official unemployment rate of 2
percent, strongly prefers having its excess labor force, estimated
at 20 million to 30 million, loafing on the job rather than on the
streets.
   Price reform, highlighted this year by sharply increased retail
prices for such basics as pork, vegetables, sugar and eggs, has
been put on hold for the second half of 1988 because of an alarming
inflation rate.
   Consumer prices in June were up 19 percent over the same month
in 1987, the highest inflation figure ever announced by the
Communist government. Officials say the living standards of 20
percent of city dwellers declined last year due to rising prices.
   Still, the government insists price reform will continue.
   ``Setting price ceilings is imposing the government's subjective
will on the objective economic life, usually departing from the law
of supply and demand,'' the People's Daily said in July. ``The
consequences include worsened scarcity of commodities, rampant
black market, heavier burden of government subsidies and worsening
of the social mood.''
   While China is a decade ahead of the Soviet Union in economic
reforms, it is struggling to keep up with political changes
emanating from Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Kremlin.
   At China's 7th National Party Congress last October, Chairman
Zhao ordered the 47-million-member Communist Party to end its
direct controls over bureaucracy and business, and stick to a more
lofty role of setting the nation's political course.
   The party is also preaching the need for more democracy. Members
of local party congresses, or legislatures, are chosen by direct
election and the National People's Congress, once a rubberstamp for
party directives, has been given greater authority to shape and
modify bills submitted by the party.
   Deng remains the ultimate voice on party matters. But he also
led the way in rejuvenating the party's aging leadership ranks last
fall when he resigned from the five-member Politburo Standing
Committee, the party's inner circle of decision-makers.
   Many conservative hardliners of his generation have faded from
the scene, replaced by university-trained technocrats in their 50s
and 60s.
   Li Peng, a 59-year-old former engineer who in March took over
the premiership held by Zhao Ziyang for eight years, is viewed as
more cautious than Zhao in introducing market principles in the
economy.
   But, as he told Japanese reporters in July, ``We all support
reform. Of course, we might have different views on a specific
issue and different opinions on steps and methods. ... This is
quite normal.''

   Life has improved for the Chinese since the dark
ages of Mao Tse-tung's tumultuous Cultural Revolution in 1966-76.
But serious problems remain.
   These are the major ones:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CORRUPTION _ It is endemic among Communist Party and government
officials. Gao Shangquan, vice minister of the State Economic
Restructuring Commission, has said, ``Power abuse for personal
gains, illegal reselling at high profits, graft and bribery are
seriously hampering normal economic operations, damaging the
reform's reputation and directly affecting the interests of both
the state and masses.''
  
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OVERPOPULATION _ China's population control policy, lauded for
its successes and condemned for its draconian methods, is in
trouble.
   The birth rate, pumped up as a 1960s baby boom generation begins
having families, hit 2 percent in 1986 and stayed there in 1987,
well above the 1.5 percent pace China needs if it is attain its
goal of holding the population, now at 1.07 billion, to 1.2 billion
in the year 2000.
   The baby explosion has been set off mainly by affluent peasants
who are willing to pay the fines and other penalties for violating
the one child per family policy, at least until they have a boy.
With the return of family farming, extra children means more hands
in the fields.
   A poem of the countryside goes: ``Why be afraid of being fined?
It just means I buy a high-priced boy. A sum of money is dead
treasure. A son is a live treasure.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CRIME _ Greater mobility (China has an estimated 50 million
``floaters'' including peddlers and drifting construction workers),
and fewer social controls has meant increased crime.
   The public security chief, Wang Fang, said 58,000 major criminal
offenses were recorded in the first five months of the year, up a
third from last year. Premier Li Peng warned law enforcement
officers they must adopt ``concrete measures to deal with
troublemaking, riots, all kinds of foreign sabotage and serious
crimes.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EDUCATION _ The education system, hobbled by Mao's
anti-intellectual biases and the ravages of the Cultural
Revolution, is severely underfinanced despite steady budget
increases in recent years.
   Although the government in 1986 promulgated a nine-year
compulsory education law, it acknowledges it will be decades before
all children go to school for a complete education. Currently only
two-thirds of those finishing the sixth grade continue their
education.
   Thousands of rural schools are closing because many teachers,
among the lowest paid people in China, are resigning, and others
are so poor they can't buy chalk.
   The situation is hardly better for the 2 percent of students
able to attend college. Dormitories house eight to a room, books
are often unavailable and classrooms are unheated and ill-equipped.
   Student discontent erupted in the winter of 1986-87 with
nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Thousands of disaffected youth are trying to leave the country
or refusing to return from overseas study programs. Only a fourth
of the 36,000 students who have gone to the United States have
returned, although it is not clear how many will eventually stay
abroad.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ARTS _ Chinese artists in 1988 are beginning to relax again
after the chill of last year's anti-bourgeois liberalization
campaign. Nude paintings and D.H. Lawrence's novels are back in
good graces. Chinese authors are again dissecting the nation's
social upheaval and two earthy films depicting the impoverished
countryside, ``Old Well'' and ``Red Sorghum,'' have won
international prizes.
   But intellectuals have always been the first to suffer in
China's political campaigns. Many, hearing officials again intone
Mao's 1957 slogan ``Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred
schools of thought contend,'' remember that in 1958 Mao launched a
campaign of retribution against those who dared to speak out.

<HEAD>Republicans Head for New Orleans to Launch Bush Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans assemble in one of America's most
colorful cities this week to launch George Bush and the vice
presidential partner of his choosing on a come-from-behind quest
for the White House _ and to bid hail and farewell to Ronald Reagan.
   Not to mention to kick Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis around from one end of the Superdome to the other.
   After 7{ years of laboring in Reagan's larger-than-life shadow,
Bush will be conqueror of all he sees at the 34th Republican
National Convention.
   His name will be the only one entered into nomination for
president Wednesday night, while his rivals from the long ago
primary campaign nurse dreams of joining the ticket as running mate
or else take their place in line with the dozens of convention
speakers.
   Bush and his high command intend to milk all the suspense they
can out of the selection of a running mate, in large part to
maximize television ratings for the convention. ``There won't be
any leaks of this one because I'm not gonna tell a soul,'' Bush
boasted last week.
   The list of contenders runs to a dozen or more names that seemed
to shift slightly depending on the day. Illinois Gov. James
Thompson announced Friday that he did not want to be considered,
but former presidential primary rivals Sen. Bob Dole and Rep. Jack
Kemp as well as others have been campaigning for the post for
weeks. Long shots who say they're interested include Sens. Dan
Quayle of Indiana and Pete Domenici of New Mexico.
   There is no doubt that Bush's choice of a running mate will win
approval from the delegates, although Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New
Hampshire has been threatening a conservative protest if Bush
doesn't pick someone sufficiently to his liking.
   Bush will depend on surrogates to rough up Dukakis, who holds
the lead in virtually all public opinion polls. He has tapped Dole,
former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Sen. Phil
Gramm of Texas _ sarcastic tormentors of the Democrats _ among
others to rough up his opponent.
   New Orleans, known for its jazz, its Mardi Gras and its
restaurants, has been planning for the Republican invasion for
months.
   Even Bourbon Street _ where jazz halls compete for customers
with the seedy burlesque houses _ has prettied itself up to a
point. ``There are lots of weirdos here, but everyone should see
them. It's hot but excellent,'' said Jeff Levy, a delegate from Los
Angeles in town a few days ahead of the rest of the pack.
   Democrats have decided to stay away from New Orleans, unlike
Republicans who held daily news conferences at the Democratic
National Convention last month to take potshots at the proceedings.
Dukakis will tend to statehouse duties in Massachusetts on Monday
and Tuesday but campaign in the Midwest and elsewhere during the
final two days of the GOP convention.
   Republicans have spared no expense in mapping out a convention
designed to maximize Bush's chances of victory in the fall.
   The podium where the vice president will deliver his acceptance
speech next Thursday night was built at a cost of more than
$500,000. Its red, white and blue color scheme was designed with
television in mind _ as was almost everything else.
   The vice president's high command has choreographed a delicate
dance to dramatize the passing of the Republican torch from Reagan
to Bush.
   Thus, they have turned the first night of the convention over to
Reagan, the man who twice led the party to landslide victories.
With Bush watching at home in Washington, the delegates will see a
videotaped tribute to the president. Then Reagan will address the
delegates and the prime time viewing audience.
   He is expected to describe in glowing terms the accomplishments
of his two terms _ and contrast them with the 21 percent interest
rates, runaway inflation and ``malaise'' that he and Bush inherited
from the Democrats in 1981.
   Tuesday morning Bush will arrive in New Orleans and meet Reagan
briefly before the president's departure for California. From then
on, it will be Bush center stage.
   Republicans will approve their platform Tuesday, a conservative
blueprint that rules out higher taxes, says no to abortion, and
affirms Bush's intention of deploying ``Star Wars.''
   With Bush advisers providing cues from just off-stage,
Republicans spent their pre-convention week drafting a 30,000-word
document designed to contrast with the bare-bones Democratic
platform. GOP chairman Frank Fahrenkopf said the platform would not
be all that different from the one Reagan ran on in 1980 and 1984,
although planks dealing with AIDs, health care and education were
inserted at Bush's direction.
   ``We're a conservative political party,'' Fahrenkopf said.
``We're proud of that. We're not afraid of the `c' word.''
   Tuesday's convention program includes Kirkpatrick's speech, as
well as an address by former President Gerald R. Ford and the
keynote address by New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean.
   Wednesday night will mark Bush's formal victory in a roll call
of the states that will end in a unanimous endorsement of his
candidacy. Television evangelist Pat Robertson, the only other
candidate to arrive in New Orleans with pledged delegates, will not
have his name entered in nomination, and will speak to the
convention Tuesday night.
   Bush will have his name entered into nomination by Gramm, with
seconding speeches to be delivered by a football coach, a Hispanic
woman, a congressman from California and Bush's son Jeb and his
wife, among others.
   The official convention schedule does not call for Bush to visit
the hall Wednesday night, although his aides say they are
considering a late night appearance at which he would dramatically
disclose his running mate to the waiting world.

<HEAD>The Dashed Hopes of Industrial Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In raising the discount rate, the Federal
Reserve dashed the hopes of a large percentage of middle-class
Americans, especially those in industrial jobs, says a pioneer in
consumer behavior studies.
   ``Their expectations fell right through the floor,'' said Albert
Sindlinger.
   Sindlinger had just finished three days of telephone interviews,
358 in all that lasted from 15 to 18 minutes each, in which
Americans were asked about their finances and expectations.
   Conditioned as he was to hearing bad news, Sindlinger
nevertheless was shocked by the computer analysis of the results.
``The very people we needed to help we hurt the most,'' he said. He
said it was a tragedy.
   These people, he explained, are ordinary American workers with a
small amount of savings and investments but no stocks or mutual
funds. Many of them are buying houses financed by adjustable
interest loans.
   That, he suggested, was enough to lower expectations about their
economic well-being six months from now. But there was more. Many
had just recently climbed up out of the financial hole; they saw
themselves tuumbling back down.
   Sindlinger, who began his telephone interviews more than three
decades ago, developing over the years a reputation for using such
data to make economic projections, observed that two years ago many
of these people were jobless.
   In late 1986, for example, his interviews suggested that no less
than 31 states, most dependent on manufacturing, oil, mining or
agriculture, were in recession.
   Disguising the plight of these states, at least in the national
statistics, were the good times experienced in the coastal areas.
The latters' results smoothed out the negatives being reported from
the interior.
   By the fall of 1987, however, all but four states were out of
recession. Once-idle blue-collar workers found jobs, and others
moved up from low-paying service-sector jobs to better paying
positions in manufacturing.
   Job data offer some documentation.
   From Aug. 2, 1987, to Aug. 1, 1988, Sindlinger & Co., in
Wallingford, Pa., found a 17.24 percent increase in production,
trade and craft jobs in manufacturing. The category showing the
next biggest rise was ``operators, fabricators and laborers.''
   These are the people hurt the most by the discount rate
increase, Sindlinger said. First, he said, their hopes were raised,
and then they were dashed. They feel betrayed, he said; ``they feel
like they've been hit with a one-two punch.''
   ``All of them expect a decline in household income within six
months,'' he said. They fear their savings will diminish. They fear
bigger expenses.
   In his opinion, the Federal Reserve made a terrible mistake in
raising the discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. First, he
said, inflation was not that big a threat. Secondly, he said, the
Fed misread the employment data.
   The Fed, he said, believed that inflation was roaring because
weekly earnings went up last month. But, he said, this was not a
case of wages rising in an inflationary manner. It was, he said,
simply the upgrading of jobs.
   As he put it: ``Workers who had been flipping hamburgers in the
service sector found better-paying jobs moving pipes around in the
manufacturing sector.''
   These are politically important people, he continued. ``They are
swing voters,'' he said. ``They put Reagan and Nixon in office, and
they could do the same with Dukakis.''
   Seldom an admirer of the Fed, Sindlinger prepared to offer
clients of his weekly service a personal opinion. He wrote:
   ``The USS Fed shot down the U.S. Economy Airbus over the Gulf of
Ignorance, using its trusty discount rate surface-to-air missile.
   ``Responsibility must be placed on the shoulders of the
commanders for gross errors of judgment.''

<HEAD>Retailing: Calm Before the Storm?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's retailers were in something of a
lull this past week as they readied or released earnings reports
and prepared for the fall selling season.
   This ``down time'' could be the calm before a storm. Some Wall
Street analysts warn that if the industry doesn't soon pull out of
its slump, it could see further takeover attempts and
consolidations.
   There were no surprises from the stores' second-quarter results.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which has excelled while other stores lagged,
reported a healthy 34 percent increase in earnings.
   May Department Stores Co. said its second-quarter net income was
about even with the same period of 1987, while F.W. Woolworth Co.
reported a 16 percent increase. The apparel retailers Limited Inc.
and Gap Inc. said their earnings fell 46 percent and nearly 19
percent, respectively.
   Analysts said the results were about as anticipated and no cause
for alarm.
   Jeffrey Edelman, who tracks retailers for the investment firm
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said, ``Even with the lackluster
sales, things did not turn out to be as bad as might ordinarily
have been expected.''
   Many retailers have had disappointing earnings the last few
quarters. Overall retail sales have been sluggish for about a year
and a half as consumers have paid off large credit card balances
and because of uncertainty about the economy. Apparel retailers
have also been hurt because their lines for last fall and spring
bombed out.
   Analysts say many companies have saved their profits from
further erosion by keeping inventories lean and trimming their
expenses, but others are struggling _ and are vulnerable to
possible takeovers.
   One potential target is Zayre Corp., the nation's eighth-largest
retailer, which recently warned its shareholders it expects to
report a substantial loss for the second quarter.
   Earlier this month, Zayre said Dart Group Corp. Chairman Herbert
Haft _ who has made a string of unsuccessful takeover bids for
retailers _ had notified the Framingham, Mass.-based company he
plans to purchase at least $15 million of its stock.
   In past months, Zayre has been rumored to be a possible target
of Wal-Mart, shopping center developer Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. and
Texas investor Robert M. Bass.
   Zayre has been weighed down by problems within its discount
store division. The company, which faces stiff competition from
other discount retailers, has been unable to find a merchandising
strategy to distinguish itself from the crowd.
   Analysts say Zayre's stock price _ which is trading in the
low-$20 range _ is depressed and that the company, with several
different divisions, could easily be broken up. This all makes
Zayre an attractive takeover candidate.
   Also vulnerable are apparel retailers. If the stores continue to
lose sales this season, ``it will accelerate the trend toward
consolidation,'' predicted Monroe Greenstein, an analyst with Bear
Stearns & Co. Inc.
   Fred Wintzer, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in
Baltimore, said small, privately-held retailers, with five to 200
stores, are in a particularly precarious state after what he called
``the worst 12-month period in the history of women's apparel.''
   These companies ``were making enough money to stay in business
before,'' Wintzer said, ``but now they're losing a lot of money.''
   Retailers that recognize their vulnerability and that are in a
position to protect themselves are doing so. Most prominent among
them is May Department Stores, which was considered a likely target
following Campeau Corp.'s takeover of Federated Department Stores
Inc. earlier this year.
   May seems to have learned from Federated's mistakes and has
begun paring divisions that don't fit with its strategy or that are
unprofitable.
   The nation's seventh-largest retailer announced recently it was
selling its Loehmann's specialty store chain, and analysts expect
other divisions, including its Southern California-based J.W.
Robinson's department store chain, to go on the block. May is also
searching for a buyer for one-half of its interest in 28 shoppings
malls.
   ``I definitely think what they're doing is defensive,'' said
Edelman of Drexel Burnham.
   But the company still has work to do. In an analysis of May last
month, Linda Kristiansen of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. estimated the
breakup value of May's stock _ what it would be worth if its
divisions were sold off _ at $54 a share. May shares, which are
currently trading in the mid-30s, are still ``undervalued,'' Ms.
Kristiansen said.

   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Interest rates marched higher as the Federal Reserve Board
boosted its discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent and major
banks raised the prime lending rate to 10 percent from 9.5 percent.
The hike in the discount rate reflected Fed concerns about rising
inflation.
   _The government reported producer prices rose 0.5 percent in
July, for an annual rate of 5.7 percent. The government also
reported retail sales rose a modest 0.5 percent last month.
   _President Reagan signed into law a $3.9 billion drought-relief
bill designed to aid farmers and ranchers, while the Agriculture
Department said it appeared this year's corn crop would fall 37
percent from 1987's harvest.
   _Attorney General Edwin Meese III allowed the Detroit News and
Detroit Free Press to merge their business and production staffs
under a joint operating agreement.
   _A former Merrill Lynch & Co. stockbroker agreed to plead guilty
to fraud charges in connection with the probe of insider trading
with advance copies of Business Week magazine. Meanwhile, the
magazine fired its broadcast editor and printer R.R. Donnelley &
Sons fired three more production workers in connection with the
scandal.
   _A House committee approved a bill under which securities firms
could face huge fines for insider trading by their employees and
bounties could be paid to people who inform authorities about such
deals. It was uncertain, however, whether the bill could be become
law this year.
   _Michael David, a young lawyer at the center of the insider
trading ring known as the ``Yuppie Five'' was sentenced to four
months in prison, nearly two years after he admitted his guilt.
   _Batus Inc. sweetened its hostile bid for Farmers Group Inc. to
more than $4.9 billion from $4.5 billion in an apparent attempt to
win a friendly agreement with the insurance company. In another
takeover fight, the apparel and furniture manufacturer and retailer
Interco Inc. rejected a sweetened $2.68 billion buyout offer from a
Washington-based investor group.
   _Rio Grande Industries Inc. received government approval for its
$1.2 billion purchase of the Southern Pacific Railroad from Santa
Fe Southern Pacific Corp.
   _The House approved and sent to the Senate a free-trade
agreement with Canada. The agreement, signed by President Reagan
and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney last January, sweeps
away most tariffs and a wide array of other trade barriers.
   _American Airlines announced plans to base as many as 700 pilots
and flight attendants in South Florida to capitalize on the
troubles of Eastern Airlines. Meanwhile, Eastern's parent, Texas
Air Corp., reported its second-quarter net loss widened sharply.
   _The Federal Aviation Administration moved to suspend a $3.6
billion contract awarded to International Business Machines Corp.
to build an air traffic control system following a government
decision to review the contract award.
   _The Postal Service said it was shelving a major portion of a
contract with Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot that drew fire from
Congress and private industry and spawned a court test of the
service's purchasing rules. The contract was initially awarded to
Perot's company without competitive bidding.

<HEAD>Hike in Discount Rate is `Godzilla' for Treasury Auctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They weren't your ordinary, run-of-the-mill
quarterly Treasury auctions.
   The Federal Reserve's surprise hike in its key discount rate
this past Tuesday caught the bond market off-guard and wreaked
havoc on the three auctions of Treasury securities that followed
the move, analysts said.
   The government bonds were not well bid. Many foreign investors,
who play a critical role in financing the nation's $2.5 trillion
debt, apparently were driven away from the sales.
   ``The Fed really threw the market a curve ball _ and did it at
the last minute,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist and senior
vice president of the fixed-income division at Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc.
   He likened the impact of the discount-rate boost on the auctions
to ``what Godzilla did to Tokyo.''
   The increase in the discount rate, the interest the Fed charges
on loans to major financial institutions, was the first such hike
since last October's stock market crash. A rise in interest rates
sends bond prices lower.
   The central bank raised the rate a half-percentage point, to 6.5
percent, in order to stem inflationary pressure on the economy.
Many market watchers had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on
the money supply _ but few were anticipating that dramatic a move.
   Consumers felt the ripples two days later, on Thursday, when the
nation's major banks responded by upping their prime lending rates
to 10 percent from 9.5 percent. The prime rate is used as a
benchmark for a range of loan charges for consumers and businesses,
such as home mortgage rates and credit card interest fees.
   Bond investors, meanwhile, were feeling shock waves. The three
auctions, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, made up the
Treasury's third-quarter refunding aimed at raising cash to finance
the federal debt. The government sold a total $29 billion in 3-year
notes, 10-year notes and short-term cash management bills.
   The discount-rate move and the economic uncertainty it stirred
up couldn't have come at a worse time, analysts contend.
   The auction results ``were pretty dismal,'' said Elizabeth
Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The demand
that everybody had thought was out there pretty much dried up at
the auctions.''
   The government issues fetched low prices, driving up interest
rates on the bonds to sky-high levels.
   Yields on the $11 billion in 3-year Treasury notes on the
auction block climbed to the highest level in three years. The
average yield was 8.77 percent, up sharply from 8.23 percent at the
last comparable auction on May 10.
   Another $11 billion in 10-year notes didn't fare much better.
Their average yield rose to 9.27 percent, up from 9.06 percent at
the last similar sale on May 11 and the loftiest level in nearly
three years.
   Foreign investors _ especially the usually bond-hungry Japanese
_ seem to have stayed away from the auctions in droves.
   ``They stayed home,'' said Ward McCarthy, chief financial
economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   The 50 percent or so participation by foreign investors that
usually marks the quarterly auctions shrunk in half, traders said.
   Compounding the problem was the absence of 30-year Treasury
bonds, normally a staple of the quarterly sales and a favorite of
Japanese investors.
   Since the Treasury has used up almost all its congressional
authority to issue long-term securities, it was forced to strike
30-year bonds from the slate of the auctions.

<HEAD>Will Drought Stifle Booming Soy Ink Business?</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   Newspaper ink made from soybean oil is a runaway success, but
the high price of soybeans is likely to drive up the price of soy
inks, forcing some publishers to return to the petroleum-based
variety.
   The choice may be purely economic for large metropolitan papers
like the Boston Globe, which switched to soy-based inks exclusively
for its color printing work about a year ago.
   But the issue could become stickier for rural newspapers in the
Farm Belt, where printing with soy-based ink is seen as one way of
helping the local soybean growers.
   ``It's pretty hard not to commit to the farmers here,'' said Lon
Myers, director of operations for the Cedar Rapids Gazette, one of
the first newspapers in the country to use soy ink in early 1987.
   But, Myers said, ``everything is subject to evaluation. There's
obviously some business judgment that has to be used.''
   So far, ink manufacturers have been willing to absorb the sharp,
drought-driven increase in soybean oil prices just to get customers
to try soy inks, and many have. Approximately 600 U.S. newspapers
are using soy ink for color reproduction, said Wilson Cunningham,
research manager for the Reston, Va.-based American Newspaper
Publishers Association, which developed soy-based ink in response
to environmental concerns about petroleum-based inks.
   Soy inks in the most frequently used colors _ blue, red and
yellow - sell for $2.50 to $3 a pound, about 5 percent more than
their petroleum-based counterparts. Newspapers say the superior
performance of the colored soy inks offsets the slightly higher
cost.
   Black soy ink, at about 90 cents a pound, costs nearly twice as
much as black petroleum ink and hasn't caught on with newspaper
publishers. As far as quality comparisons, ``black is black,''
Myers said in a telephone interview.
   The Midwestern drought has withered soybean crops and pushed the
price of crude soybean oil up dramatically on the Chicago Board of
Trade, from about 21 cents to about 27 cents a pound since the
start of the year.
   In a crop production report released Thursday, the Agriculture
Department estimated soybean oil prices for the coming
October-through-September marketing year would average 25.5 cents a
pound. The USDA estimated soybean oil production for the period at
11.1 billion pounds, 14 percent less than estimated production of
12.9 billion pounds for the current marketing year.
   Despite the lower production, surplus stocks of soybean oil
should be adequate, said Stan Pendlum, an economist with the St.
Louis-based American Soybean Association.
   Herb Edelman, vice president of operations for the United States
Printing Ink Corp., a national ink distributor based in East
Rutherford, N.J., said the price of soy-based inks likely will rise
``in time.''
   ``I think we'll have to address that before the end of the year
after the situation stabilizies,'' he said.
   J.M. Huber Corp. of Edison, N.J., another major manufacturer of
newspaper ink, also has held the line on its soy-based inks despite
the rise in soybean oil prices.
   ``We're hoping the drought is a temporary blip and soy oil
prices will come down to ordinary levels,'' said Dennis Sweet,
Huber's market specialist for newspaper inks.
   The Boston Globe would almost certainly switch back to
petroleum-based ink if the price of soy ink rose significantly,
said John Bopp, the newspaper's quality control manager.
   Bopp said the color capabilities of new petroleum inks approach
the quality of soy inks.
   Traditionally, ``the cheapest price buys the ink'' at most
newspapers, said Cunningham of the ANPA.
   ``The superior quality of soybean inks may make someone be
willing to pay a higher price, but it's hard to say,'' he said.
   On the other hand, both Cunningham and Myers pointed out that
petroleum ink prices may also rise. Many energy market analysts
expect crude oil prices to increase after the Iran-Iraq cease-fire.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 17th graf, The New ... at 296.48., to reflect NYSE's
revision of its composite index.</NOTE>

   As they have demonstrated anew in the past few
days, Wall Street investors are a tough group to please on the
subject of inflation.
   In the bond market, especially, inflation is public enemy No. 1
because it erodes the value of money invested in long-term assets
with fixed face values.
   And when the bond market suffers from inflation fears, so
usually does the stock market.
   But what happens when the Federal Reserve and other central
banks in leading industrialized countries take a militant stance
against inflation, and back up their words with action?
   If you take Tuesday's increase in the discount rate by the Fed
as a case in point, the markets react with dismay.
   One prominent concern is that in their zeal to keep inflation in
check, policy-makers will tighten credit enough to cause a
recession at some point down the road.
   But some optimistic forecasters don't buy that argument. They
contend that a modest pinch now by the Fed could forestall the
necessity for a crunch later on.
   Statistics reported to date suggest that inflation in this
country is creeping up, but not accelerating rapidly.
   There was some uneasy reaction in the markets Friday when the
government reported that the Producer Price Index rose 0.5 percent
in July _ 0.6 percent if you exclude food and energy prices, which
are prone to erratic short-term fluctuations that don't indicate
any lasting trends.
   The big worry on the Street these days is that the robust pace
of economic activity will soon quicken the pace of prices as it
strains labor and production capacity.
   However, some analysts contend that these fears are unjustified.
``The economy is strong, but strong for the right reasons,''
maintains Michael Sherman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``The inflation picture itself is still not a problem despite
all the rhetoric.
   ``We think that inflation must be watched, but we do not see
reasons for higher interest rates at this time, and we believe
there may emerge forces that could bring long rates (e.g., on
bonds) down from present levels.''
   As Edward Yardeni at Prudential-Bache Securities put it:
``Growth is good. That's our motto.
   ``We're trying to recruit as many people as possible to repeat
it 10 times each morning, so that it might become a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Frankly, we need all the help we can get because the
``growth is bad'' camp has many more believers.''
   Yardeni and the other optimists got little help from the stock
market in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
fell 81.61 points to 2,037.52.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 4.56 to
148.53; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
lost 8.76 to 378.95, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was down 8.47 at 296.48.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 180.08 million shares a day,
against 155.81 million the week before.
   Actually, some analysts point out, the response on the Street to
tighter credit hasn't been entirely negative.
   While all interest rates have been moving up lately, they point
out, long-term rates have not risen as fast as short-term rates.
That suggests to some observers that the Fed's anti-inflation
efforts might be successful, and beneficial to the financial
markets over time.
   ``We're impressed with the macho approach of the central
bankers,'' said Yardeni.
   ``We expect that the aggressive actions of the central bankers
will increase the chances that our sustainable-growth and

<HEAD>South Africa Announces Rise In Fuel Prices, Surcharges On Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced major
steps Friday to shore up the economy, including a 15 percent
increase in fuel prices and higher surcharges on luxury imports.
   Consumer and business groups complained that the increase in
fuel prices would halt a recent decline in the inflation rate,
which has fallen from 17 percent in 1987 to 12.4 percent.
   The Black Consumers Union said the fuel price increase would be
a particular hardship to poor blacks who rely on lamp fuel to light
unelectrified homes.
   George Bartlett, deputy minister of economic affairs, said the
price for high-octane gasoline will increase by 15.9 percent to
about $1.60 a gallon. Similar increases in low-octane gasoline and
other fuels will be introduced.
   Finance Minister Barend du Plessis and Economic Affairs Minister
Dawie de Villiers announced a separate package of economic
measures, including restrictions on installment purchases to curb
borrowing and higher surcharges on imports such as motor vehicles,
tobacco, televisions, coffee, tea and jewelry.
   On many items, the existing 10 percent surcharge will be raised
to 60 percent.
   The ministers said the steps had been caused by high domestic
spending, which placed pressure on interest rates and led to
increased imports.
   If consumers curtailed spending, they said, the government could
avoid ``further and more painful steps.''
   The higher consumption had boosted imports of crude oil and
moved South Africa away from ``desired levels'' of energy
self-sufficiency, Bartlett said.
   South Africa is the target of international oil embargo but
imports an estimated $3 billion worth of oil a year. It does not
disclose details of its oil needs.
   Economists say the increased fuel imports have been a major
factor in a recent severe reduction in South Africa's balance of
payments surplus. South Africa's currency, the rand, has weakened
as a result and the cost of imported fuel has risen.
   Business organizations conceded the need for a fuel price
increase but said the announced rise was excessive.
   In a separate development, the government announced it would
implement a new labor bill Sept. 1 despite ongoing negotiations
between employers and black trade unions to resolve disputes over
the legislation.
   The Labor Relations Amendment would effectively outlaw sympathy
strikes and consumer boycotts in connection with labor disputes.
   A committee of employer representatives had agreed to recommend
that the government remove six controversial sections from the bill.
   The country's two largest black labor federations responded by
calling on employers to pledge that they would not invoke some of
the provisions in the bill that could weaken unions.
   They called the government's decision to implement the bill
despite the negotiations amounted to ``pandering to minority
right-wing interests.''

<HEAD>NY Investment Firm, Maine Broker Fined $110,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York-based investment firm and a
broker in Maine were fined $110,000 after being charged with
selling unregistered stocks and misrepresenting a risky stock to
investors, Maine's attorney general said Friday.
   The investment firm Gruntal & Co. and Portland broker Richard A.
Liberty neither admit nor deny guilt to the charges outlined in the
consent decree, which was signed Thursday by Superior Court Justice
Morton Brody.
   Attorney General James E. Tierney said the complaint filed in
Kennebec County Superior Court alleged that Gruntal and Liberty on
more than 100 occasions sold to Maine residents stock in a computer
software company that was unregistered in the state.
   Although Gruntal and Liberty told investors that the stock in
MicroShare Corp. of Utah was an ``excellent investment,'' it was
actually ``highly speculative and risky'' because MicroShare is a
new company in a highly competitive market, said the attorney
general's complaint.
   Rufus E. Brown, lawyer for Gruntal and Liberty, took issue
Friday with the charge that Liberty misrepresented the stocks. He
said ``most if not all'' buyers signed statements in which they
indicated they understood the stocks were speculative.
   The consent decree orders Liberty to pay at least $20,000 of the
fine and Gruntal to pay at least $75,000. Liberty is a cousin of
Portland real-estate developer Michael Liberty, according to the
defendants' lawyer.
   The consent decree also enjoins the defendants from selling
unregistered securities in Maine.
   Tierney said the complaint arose from an investigation by the
Maine Banking Bureau's Securities Division.

<HEAD>Jury Finds Burger King Has Rights To `Chicken Tender' Trademark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A frozen poultry producer's decision to call its
bite-sized pieces ``chicken tenders'' violated Burger King's
exclusive right to the name, a U.S. District Court jury concluded
Friday.
   The jury, which deliberated for about four hours following eight
days of unorthodox and amusing testimony, rejected Pilgrim's
Pride's claim that ``chicken tenders'' is a generic term and should
not be subject to trademark regulations.
   Alan Greer, an attorney for Miami-based Burger King Corp., said
the fast-food giant will file motions within 30 days seeking an
order from Judge Eugene Spellman to prohibit Pilgrim's Pride from
using the name.
   The company also will request payments equal to the profits
Pilgrim's Pride received on the $4.5 million in boneless chicken
morsels sold since early 1986, said Greer.
   In the meantime, Greer said Dallas-based Pilgrim's Pride uses
the chicken tender name ``at their peril.''
   ``Burger King is very pleased by the verdict,'' said Burger King
spokesman Doug Timberlake, reading from a prepared statement.
   But Pilgrim's Pride Chief Executive Officer Lonnie ``Bo''
Pilgrim maintains that the tender, or tenderloin breast, is an
accepted name used in the poultry industry for many years.
   ``The jury missed the point,'' said Pilgrim. ``It puts us in a
situation of not knowing what to call our product. ... Burger King
learned about the name tender from the chicken industry.''
   Pilgrim said the company has not decided if it will appeal the
verdict ending the nine-day trial, which included technical debate
over chicken anatomy and a dramatic dismembering of a raw bird.
   Throughout the trial, jurors were presented with tough talk
about the mysterious 2{-inch ``tenders'' by a parade of
entertaining witnesses discussing poultry, linguistics and
advertising. Color, texture and even aftertaste were examined.
   Miami-based U.S. Department of Agriculture spokesman Harold
Havner testified he believed tenders was a generic term.
   In turn, Burger King attorney Louis Pirkey claimed Pilgrim's
Pride used the name tenders to ``ride the coattails'' of a $20
million Burger King advertising campaign launched in early 1986 to
hail the arrival of the chicken tenders around the nation.
   ``You might say they had 20 million reasons to call it chicken
tenders,'' said Pirkey last Tuesday.
   ``I don't steal,'' responded Pilgrim, a Texas farmer who
oversees the 20,000-pound-an-hour Pilgrim's Pride processing plant.
   In one of the most dramatic moments of the trial, University of
Arkansas professor Tommy Lee Goodwin on Tuesday dismembered a
plucked 3-pound bird with a butcher's knife to give jurors an
intimate look at the disputed section of the chicken, technically
known as the pectoralis minor.
   Spellman had to give written permission to allow the carving
knife into the court building.
   ``People who know chickens will still be calling them tenders no
matter what the jury said,'' Pilgrim said.

<HEAD>Lawyer Pleads Innocent to Insider Trading Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former partner in a major Chicago law firm
pleaded innocent Friday to federal charges he used information
gained through the firm for illegal stock trades.
   Alfred Elliott, 44, a former partner in Schiff, Hardin and
Waite, pleaded innocent before U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen.
   A 70-count indictment returned against Elliott in July charged
he made over $680,000 between March 1984 and April 1986 on insider
information about the takeover of nine companies.
   Elliott was one of two lawyers at the firm who represented
companies in matters related to imminent mergers or acquisitions.
   The lawyer is charged with one count of racketeering, 34 counts
of wire fraud, 34 counts of securities fraud and one count of
income tax evasion, according to the indictment.
   In a 1986 civil case filed in federal court by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, Elliott paid more than $500,000 in damages
and repaid profits from similar allegations, according to his
attorney, Matthew F. Kennelly.
   In return for paying the money back, the lawyer did not have to
admit or deny charges of insider information, according to records
from the 1986 case.
   Elliott left the law firm in March, 1986. Kennelly said he did
not know why Elliott left.
   Aspen set a tentative trial date for Jan. 9.

   Mike Kelley won the employee drawing for
one of the last two Pontiac Fieros that will roll off the assembly
line Tuesday, but he said he won't be driving the car home.
   Instead, Kelley said he will hook a tow truck to the $14,319 red
Fiero GT when it leaves the line so the jaunty two-seater can be
enshrined in mint condition, its odometer forever on zero.
   ``You just can't drive the last car off the line. That would be
a sin,'' he said. ``Too many memories have gone into that car. It's
a dream car and should stay that way.''
   Kelley, 37, is a veteran of 19 years with General Motors Corp.
He was laid off Aug. 5 as a truck driver for the Fiero plant.
   Pontiac is shutting down the plant because of sagging sales of
the two-seat, plastic-bodied, rear-engined sports car.
   GM officials declined to release the name of the second employee
who won a Fiero because they had not received permission to do so.
   Kelley said he was thrilled that his name was pulled from a drum
filled with the names of plant employees on Thursday, but upset
that the Fiero is being discontinued.
   ``I would like to see them keep making the car,'' he said. ``We
had a heck of a work force. I've worked all over Pontiac and that
plant really came together. We had some say so and before that they
never listened to you.''
   Kelley said he saw the first Fiero come off the line at the
plant in Pontiac, about 20 miles northwest of Detroit. He said he
will watch the last one make its three-hour assembly trip.
   Kelly said he planned to find a museum in which he could store
the Fiero. He said he has no doubts about his decision to keep the
last Fiero untouched by the realities of roads, rains and rush
hours, though his whole family does not share that wish.
   ``My 17-year-old son was really bummed out. He was thinking of
all the girls he could pick up with the car,'' Kelley said.

<HEAD>Grocery Chain Plans Sale of Florida's Kash n' Karry Chain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Stores Co., the new owner of the
Lucky grocery chain, announced Friday it would sell Lucky's 95 Kash
n' Karry supermarkets in Florida to a management group for $305
million.
   The deal is the second of a number of expected asset sales to
help American pay off the $2.6 billion in loans it took out to
finance the purchase of Lucky Stores Inc. in May.
   American also said it had completed the previously announced
sale of Lucky's 38 ABCO Markets in Arizona to a management group
there for $75 million.
   American, which owns Alpha Beta stores in California, other
supermarkets in several states and the 27-state Osco drug chain,
completed its purchase of the Lucky chain May 20.
   The merger has tentative antitrust approval from the Federal
Trade Commission, but California regulators oppose the deal on
grounds it would lessen competition. A final FTC decision is
expected about the end of the year.
   Present Kash n' Karry employees would keep their jobs under the
proposed acquisition by a management-allied group including Ron
Floto, president and chief executive officer. Kash n' Karry, with
headquarters in Tampa, has 95 supermarkets in central and western
Florida.
   Financing for the management buyout is being arranged by
Gibbons, Green, van Amerogen, which has financed many such
management buyouts, the partnership said in a news release.
   American acquired Lucky in a leveraged buyout, meaning the
purchase was financed by loans. Assets of the acquired company
often are sold off to pay the debt from such purchases, but
American spokesman Troy D'Ambrosio declined to say if more sales
were pending.
   American moved its corporate headquarters from Salt Lake City to
this Orange County community July 1, seeking improved access to
financial markets.
   American, with sales of $14.27 million last year, owns Jewel
Food stores in Chicago, Acme markets in Philadelphia, Star Markets
in Boston, Skaggs-Alpha Beta in the Southwest and Buttrey food
stores in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho.

<HEAD>Business Week Dismisses Broadcast Editor</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For Saturday PMs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business Week's editorial staff was stunned as
the magazine's own broadcast editor became the latest casualty in
the swelling insider-trading scandal surrounding trading on
pre-publication information.
   S.G. ``Rudy'' Ruderman, who had broadcast market and business
news for Business Week since 1981, was fired Friday for failing to
disclose ``all the (stock) trades he made and the full extent of
his holdings'' in accordance with the ethics code, the magazine
said in a statement.
   Shock reverberated through the magazine's editorial offices,
where Ruderman shared quarters until he was confronted by
McGraw-Hill and magazine officials when he arrived for work Friday.
He was dismissed shortly after the meeting.
   ``It's deeply disturbing,'' said managing editor John Dierdorff.
``I fervently hope this distressing incident is the end of it,''
but he said the magazine's own investigation was continuing.
   McGraw-Hill Inc., Business Week's publisher, learned late
Thursday from the New York Stock Exchange's surveillance unit that
Ruderman might have made four or five trades in 1988 involving
stocks mentioned in the magazine's ``Inside Wall Street'' column,
the statement said.
   The firing came a day after the first criminal charge was filed
in the scandal. William Dillon, a stock broker who had been fired
by Merrill Lynch & Co., for suspcious trades was charged with mail
fraud Thursday, and his lawyer said he would plead guilty.
   Seven employees of Business Week's printer also have lost their
jobs, as have two brokers at two other investment firms.
   Ruderman, 62, did not report, write or edit stories for Business
Week. But he broadcast a business news report several times a day
from the magazine's office in midtown Manhattan to radio stations
in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Fort Wayne, Ind.
   All stations except Fort Wayne are owned by Group W Broadcasting
and have suspended the business program. Business Week spokeswoman
Mary McGeachy had no comment on the Fort Wayne station.
   Dierdorff said Ruderman regularly received a page proof of the
``Inside Wall Street'' column on Thursdays _ hours before its
official release to the public _ to make sure companies mentioned
in the column were not referred to in radio broadcasts. Ruderman
also was free to use the information in his weekend reports, which
were taped on Fridays.
   Ruderman could not be reached for comment. He was not in the
Business Week office, and both numbers at his home in suburban
Scarsdale, N.Y., were answered by machines.
   His lawyer, Alan Kaufman, said he was in the process of
``gathering whatever relevant information exists ... it's a matter
that just arose this morning.''
   Magazine officials had maintained since the investigation into
suspicious stock trading was made public last month that its
editorial employees were not involved.
   Until Friday, much attention in the scandal had focused on the
four plants where the magazine is printed. Six employees of the
printing concern R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. have been fired and one
has resigned as a result of an in-house investigation that
allegedly found workers sold advance copies of Business Week.
   Merrill Lynch and Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. each fired
one broker as a result of their investigations into suspicious
trades involving stocks mentioned in the Business Week column. A
broker for Advest Inc. resigned after being suspended by that firm.
   Dillon, the broker fired at Merrill Lynch's office in New
London, Conn., agreed to plead guilty to federal mail fraud charges.
   Court papers indicated Dillon and an unidentified person paid
various Donnelley employees $20 to $30 an issue for advance copies
of Business Week.
   On many Thursday mornings, Dillon allegedly bought a total of
about 129 stocks of companies that got a favorable mention in
``Inside Wall Street,'' netting him $94,000 in profits.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Jump; Interest Rates Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-term interest rates have risen to an eight-month high in
response to the Labor Department's report that wholesale prices
rose at a 5.7 percent annual rate in July.
   The yield of the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose
Friday to 9.42 percent, its highest point since 9.44 percent on
Dec. 11, 1987, rounding out a bad string of performances for the
bond market.
   ``It's just been a lousy week,'' said Mitchell Held, chief
financial economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., referring
to the slide in the bond market.
   Inflation fears made for a bad week on Wall Street as well. The
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 1.78 to 2,037.52,
extending its loss for the week to 81.61 points.
   The dollar was mixed Friday against major foreign currencies,
while oil futures prices declined.
   In another indication of rising rates, a nationwide survey
Friday found interest rates on new one-year, adjustable-rate
mortgages surged this week to 8 percent, the highest level since
last November.
   Fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 10.57 percent, just below the
peak of of late May and early June, according to the survey by the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   On the inflation front, the Labor Department said the 0.5
percent rise in its Producer Price Index in July occurred in spite
of smaller increases in food prices. That compared with a rise of
0.4 percent in June.
   Analysts were concerned that, unlike previous months, the
biggest increases were not in the normally highly volatile food and
energy sectors but across a wide spectrum of consumer and capital
goods.
   Drugs, men's clothing, tires, soaps, cosmetics, home electronic
equipment, glassware, tobacco products and construction equipment
all rose at annualized inflation rates in the double digits.
   ``These prices will slow down, but something else ... will pick
up the slack,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic
forecasting at Georgia State University. ``There's a lot of
inflation kicking around.''
   Ratajczak predicted the August figures will look even worse when
they come out next month as energy prices rebound and the impact of
the Farm Belt drought wends its way through the food production
process.
   Consumer food prices on the wholesale level rose just 0.4
percent in July. The price decline was led by falling meat costs as
drought-plagued farmers and ranchers rushed their herds to
slaughter rather than continue feeding them high-cost grains.
   In a related report on the inflationary front, the Commerce
Department reported Friday business inventories rose 0.7 percent in
June despite a 1.5 percent increase in sales.
   That indicated some businesses were stocking up on inventories
to beat expected price increases, said Allen Sinai of the Boston
Co., a money management firm.

<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices headed lower again on what
analysts described as technical factors.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for September
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, closed down 24 cents Friday to $15.52 a 42-gallon
barrel. The contract had risen 5 cents on Thursday.
   Refined petroleum products also headed lower Friday. Unleaded
gasoline for September delivery fell 0.52 cent to close at 46.02
cents a gallon, after rising 0.45 cent Thursday.
   Heating oil, which rose 0.41 cent in the previous session, fell
0.56 cent to finish at 44 cents a gallon.
   ``I think a lot of today's activity was technical,'' said Peter
Beutel, an oil analyst with Elders Futures Inc. ``There's no news
that I'm aware of.''
   Beutel said the market remained in a holding pattern, awaiting
word on what action OPEC might take to help prop up sagging
worldwide prices.
   Oil prices have declined in recent months amid reports that some
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had
exceeded their official production quotas.
   Prices rebounded in recent days after news of a United
Nations-sponsored effort to end the fighting between Iran and Iraq,
two members of OPEC.
   Analysts attributed Thursday's rise primarily to speculative
buying.
